Incorporation of a protease step into the Theander method \"A\" modestly increased, and addition of a pepsin digestion further increased the proportion of total fiber recovered in the S fraction. The effect of extraction method on the distribution of TNS, UA, and beta G between the S and I fractions varied with the food. The three methods measured the same total DF in a food and 1-3% starch in the I fraction of peas and kidney beans. Use of dimethyl sulfoxide to solubilize starch, or elevated temperature to extract S components, had no effect on the distribution of DF between S and I fractions of peas and macaroni. Incomplete protein hydrolysis did not always lower Klason lignin and excluding lignin from the fiber complex did not always substantially increase the S fraction.\r"

In a subset of subjects, plasma biotin concentrations were also measured. In adults the biotin excretion rate was significantly greater in the vegan group than in either the lactoovovegetarian or the mixed-diet groups; the latter were not significantly different from one another. In children the biotin excretion rates in both the vegan group and the lactoovovegetarin group were significantly greater than in the mixed-diet group. A similar trend (vegan greater than lactoovovegetarian greater than mixed) was detected in the plasma concentrations of biotin of adults and children but differences were not generally statistically significant. These observations provide evidence that the biotin nutritional status of vegans is not impaired.\r"

Compared with age-, sex-, and race-matched controls, 1 of 70 patients with homozygous SCA (SS), 1 of 7 with sickle beta+-thalassemia, and 0 of 24 with hemoglobin SC disease had E deficiency according to E:L and all were E-sufficient based on serum E levels. Serum cholesterol levels, lower in SS patients than in control subjects, correlated more strongly with serum E levels than did total serum lipid levels in control subjects and SS patients; hence, the ratio of serum E to cholesterol may be a useful indicator of E status in these patients. We conclude that vitamin E deficiency rarely occurs in SCA patients in Colorado.\r"

BMC was measured by single-photon absorptiometry. Dietary intakes during current and early periods of life were assessed by 24-h dietary recall and frequency methods. Information about drug use was obtained by interview. BMC/BW was not different in omnivores vs vegetarians. There were no significant relationships or trends between current or early dietary intakes and BMC/BW in either group.

The absence of an effect was seen against two background diets, one high in saturated fatty acids and the other modified in fat content and in fatty acid composition. Although the mean high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration did not change, the proportion of HDL2 particles (radius greater than 4.4 nm) increased significantly, especially in subjects who did not show a rise in plasma cholesterol; this may represent a means of clearing dietary cholesterol. The results suggest that reducing dietary cholesterol might be emphasized for hypercholesterolemic subjects rather than for the population generally.\r"

Plasma nicotine levels confirmed the reliability of dosing. RMR increases of 6% above base line after both moderate and low doses were significantly greater than the 3% increase after the placebo. Subsequent examination of the effects of smoking a nonnicotine cigarette suggested that the small placebo effect was due to acute metabolic consequences of inhalation. These results confirm that intake of nicotine, isolated from tobacco smoke, significantly increases RMR in humans. However, the results also indicate that non-pharmacological, behavioral aspects of smoking may also contribute to acutely increasing RMR in smokers.\r"

Cases were classified according to degree of ductal atypia (Black-Chablon grading system). Women with atypic lesions (grades greater than or equal to 3) reported a higher intake of all types of foods compared with both control series. Further analyses indicated that the increased consumption was due primarily to foods containing greater than or equal to 10% fat. Odds ratios associated with the highest fat consumption quartile were close to 3.0. There was a trend for increasing saturated fatty acid consumption with increasing ductal atypica. After adjusting for hormonal and demographic confounders, the association with fat intake was strengthened. Because atypic BBD has been reported to be a precursor of breast cancer, our findings lend support to the hypothesis that dietary fat is a risk factor for breast cancer.\r"

Three theoretically possible confounders were found in a systematic search for dietary factors: 1) low intake of ascorbic acid, 2) excess of phytates, and 3) increased absorption of lead. Ascorbic acid has a marked effect on the bioavailability of dietary iron and is also known to directly influence various metabolic processes in the brain. Phytates inhibit the absorption not only of iron but also of zinc. An iron deficiency may thus be accompanied by a zinc deficiency which may affect mental performance. A state of iron deficiency may increase the absorption of lead from the diet, which in turn may affect brain function.\r"

The most prominent feature of ID is the significant and selective diminution of central dopamine neurotransmission resulting from the decreased number of dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, pituitary, and in all probability the frontal cortex. The consequences of diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission is a modification of dopamine-dependent behaviors and biochemical reactions, the most important of which is the reduction in learning processes. The role of iron in maintaining the homeostasis of normally functioning dopamine neurons and their involvement in cognitive processes cannot be excluded. An interference with iron metabolism at an early age can result in irreversible damage to developing dopamine neurons, with consequences that may manifest themselves in adult life.\r"

Because many children had malarial parasitemia at testing, presence of malaria was used in the analysis. A significant interaction was found between iron and malaria infection on total fixation time: iron-supplemented groups and placebo-treated parasitemic children showed significantly higher total fixation scores than did placebo-treated aparasitemic children. Blood analysis of iron status showed similar results, with lowest iron status evident in the placebo-treated aparasitemic group. There was no effect of treatment on rate of habituation or dishabituation.

No difference between the effect of oral administration of iron or placebo was noted after 10 d or 3 mo of iron therapy.

An anthelminthic drug was given on the day of the blood test before treatment and 3 mo after the intervention started. There is evidence of a positive association between iron status and IQ and a language school achievement test but there is no support for the internal validity of the hypothesis that this association is causal.\r"

  ".W": "The prognostic significance of DNA ploidy measurements in cervical tissues was examined. Microphotometric measurements of 302 Feulgen-stained tissue sections (91 normal squamous epithelia, 14 condylomata, 29 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I, 78 CIN II, and 90 CIN III) were performed with a personal computer (PC)-based video microphotometry system. Analysis of these data shows that the DNA profile provides significant prognostic information: CINs with a polyploid DNA profile are more likely to return to normal than are those exhibiting an aneuploid pattern. Of 211 abnormal cases, 38% had polyploid DNA profiles and 62% were aneuploid. Eight-six percent of the cases that regressed were polyploid and 14% were aneuploid. Of the 130 aneuploid DNA cases, 95% remained static or progressed and only 5% regressed. Of these nonregressing aneuploid lesions, 90 remained static and 34 progressed, whereas within the nonregressing polyploid group 37 remained static and only 6 progressed. This result holds across diagnostic categories. Several other ploidy-related descriptors also showed prognostic significance (including mean ploidy, the 5N exceeding rate and 2N deviation index, and discriminant functions derived from order statistic analysis of the cumulative DNA histograms), but not to the degree or with the consistency of expression as the DNA profile categorization. These results indicate that important information about the prognosis of CIN lesions may be obtained by the DNA profile on Feulgen-stained tissue specimens. The data were acquired by a cytophotometry system of relatively modest cost consisting of readily available hardware components.\r"

The present study further documents this finding by a multimodality approach on serial sections from 25 meningiomas of all histologic and clinical categories. Standard light microscopic examination, immunohistochemical staining with a variety of epithelial and nonepithelial markers, and histochemical staining for mucin were performed on each case. Directed electron microscopic examination was performed on selected examples of epithelial feature-positive and -negative cases. All cases were immunoreactive for vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen. Thirty-two percent were reactive for cytokeratin and 39% for S-100. Twenty percent showed mucin positivity by histochemistry. Electron microscopic examination of cytokeratin-positive cases showed either intracellular lumina (secretory areas) or cytoplasmic tonofibrils, whereas cytokeratin-negative tumors lacked lumina and tonofibrils. Previous studies showing epithelial features in meningiomas are reviewed with emphasis on the studies using immunohistochemistry. These histochemical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural characteristics are of utility in the examination of tumors of suspected meningeal origin, particularly when dealing with atypical presentations or histomorphologic features.\r"

Both automated Hb methods were linear over the range 0-250 g/L (0-25 g/dL) and correlated well with the International Committee for Standardization of Hematology (ICSH) reference method and with the Coulter S+II. Both methods quantitatively converted whole blood containing up to 100% carboxyhemoglobin in less than 24 seconds to their respective end products. With respect to abnormal samples (sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, and hyperlipemia), both H*1 methods gave Hb results that were equivalent to the (postfiltration) ICSH method. For samples with white blood cell (WBC) counts less than 36 X 10(9)/L, the +CN method was equivalent to the (postfiltration) ICSH method, whereas for WBC counts greater than 20 X 10(9)/L, the -CN method showed acceptable recovery of the mean but unacceptable imprecision. For WBC counts of 36-164 X 10(9)/L, the +CN method yielded acceptable Hb recovery with unacceptable imprecision. Hyperlipemia, resulting from addition of Intralipid directly to the blood samples, caused large errors in both H*1 methods.\r"

Seven ISI- (International Sensitivity Index) calibrated commercial thromboplastin reagents were used for duplicate determinations in 30 normal subjects, 30 patients with liver disease, and 30 patients receiving stabilized oral anticoagulation. Clotting times were longer with the manual method than with ACL 810 and, to a lesser extent, with KoaguLab 40 A. Average imprecision of duplicate determinations (CV) was less than 1% with ACL 810; KoaguLab 40 A and the manual method had similarly higher imprecisions (2.8% and 2.7%). Differences in origin and slope of the regression curves of clotting times obtained with the coagulometers over the tilt-tube method were observed with all the reagents tested. Transformation of clotting times to PT ratios did not eliminate the bias resulting from the different clot-detection methods. A higher percentage of patients with liver disease had abnormal PT ratios when their plasma was tested with the coagulometers than with the manual method. Transformation of PT ratios to International Normalized Ratios effectively eliminated the bias resulting from the different thromboplastin reagents but had no effect on the bias resulting from the different clot-detection methods. A significant proportion of patients appeared excessively anticoagulated (INR greater than 4.5) with the coagulometers but not with the manual method. These results highlight the need for standardization of both instrumentations and reagents to improve monitoring of oral anticoagulant treatment.\r"

Morphologically, this form shows distinct differences from the classic form of APL, but clinically it shares many of the same traits. Among these is the predilection for coagulopathies, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This DIC has been associated with one previously reported case of fatal hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome), in association with an untreated case of APL. The authors present a case of the microgranular variant of acute promyelocytic leukemia (FAB-M3V), with autopsy and electron microscopic evidence in support. It is important to recognize this variant form of APL and its association with hepatic vein thrombosis, because any successful attempt at therapy must be instituted early in the course of the disease.\r"

Cast bronchitis had a long-term course of 10 to 24 months in 65 of the 74 patients. Common radiologic findings included bronchi presumably filled with secretions, areas of atelectasis, and lung emphysema of varying degrees. Cast bronchitis did not appear to be associated with eosinophilia and elevated serum IgE levels. Therefore, an extrinsic allergic mechanism is not likely involved in the pathogenesis of the condition. Bronchial casts had varying consistencies; although they were usually soft, they were sometimes rather hard. They were hollow, often ramified, and white and measured from 0.5 to 2 cm in length. Histologically, they consisted of metaplastic squamous epithelium with a varying degree of inflammatory cells and noncellular material. Some differences in biochemical composition were observed between bronchial casts and bronchial exudate of acute catarrhal bronchitis. No viruses could be isolated in 11 cast specimens. Our results suggest that cast formation is mainly related to the metaplastic transformation of the bronchial epithelium and that this metaplasia may play an important pathophysiologic role in certain infants and children with obstructive bronchitis.\r"

One isolate was from an ill, bacteremic patient; the others were in mixed culture and were not considered causes of disease. The isolates were not epidemiologically related. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for various antibiotics included ampicillin (16 to 32 mg/L), penicillin (128 mg/L), gentamicin (16 mg/L), and vancomycin (2 mg/L). Three isolates demonstrated high-level resistance (greater than 2000 mg/L) to streptomycin; none did so to gentamicin. In vitro synergy testing performed on seven available isolates for ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated no synergy to this combination. None produced beta-lactamase. Combined antibiogram and plasmid data showed at least five distinct patterns.

These antibodies were detected before the development of deeper staphylococcal infections. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important, as they may prevent long-term infectious complications.\r"

Risks of various outcomes were assessed for control and treatment groups from each study, and risk differences were determined. For each outcome a weighted average of the individual risk differences was calculated. The results show that corticosteroid administration did not reduce the risk of death or neurologic abnormality at hospital discharge or follow-up examination. Based on statistically combined results of the three most recent trials, there is evidence that dexamethasone reduces the risk of bilateral moderate or more severe hearing loss (risk difference, -9%; 95% confidence limits, -15% and -3%). However, this may be true only for children with meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b. There are inadequate data in adults or in children with meningitis due to other organisms to demonstrate the benefit of dexamethasone administration. Further study is necessary to fully assess the benefits and risks of corticosteroids for adjunctive therapy for bacterial meningitis.\r"

The study aimed to ascertain the applicability of fiberoptic bronchoscopy for assessment of endotracheal tube tip position, and to assess the incidence and clinical significance of airway disease in unselected patients. Seventy examinations on 65 neonates were performed without interruption of mechanical ventilation. The procedure was well tolerated in all cases. The accuracy of bronchoscopic measurement of endotracheal tube tip position improved markedly with user experience and reached a correlation of .96 with a chest roentgenogram. Although the technique was safe and accurate, the need for available and skilled personnel may limit the applicability of this method for endotracheal tube tip position assessment. Significant airway disease requiring a change in treatment was found in 13 patients (19%). This high incidence of significant but clinically unsuspected airway disease suggests that there should be more frequent consideration of diagnostic bronchoscopy in all sick intubated neonates who are at risk for airway disease.\r"

Important barriers to providing advice on smoking cessation to parents included negative parental expectations and not having enough time.

In the fourth patient, hemophilia was prenatally diagnosed, and vaginal delivery resulted in cephalohematoma. Diagnosis was delayed in three patients, including one with a family history of hemophilia. Central nervous system bleeding may be more common in hemophilic neonates than has been presumed. Pregnancy management should include consideration of family history of bleeding disorders and carrier testing in appropriate cases. In confirmed carriers, prenatal diagnosis is justified to allow choice of the least traumatic delivery method. Any term neonate with intracranial hemorrhage should be treated as being possibly hemophilic until proved otherwise.\r"

Anthropometric measurements of arm circumference and arm muscle circumference were less than the fifth percentile in all patients developing hypophosphatemia. We concluded that hypophosphatemia is an underrecognized complication of nutritional repletion and that anthropometric measurements may be predictive of patients at risk.

Peripheral venous blood samples were obtained at 30-min intervals over the next 2 h. After the 90 mM infusion, the serum acetate response reached a peak at 60 min and had fallen to baseline by 120 min. The incremental area under the serum acetate response curve after 180 mM was twice that after 90 mM. Propionate was undetectable in serum at any time. Blood glucose fell after all of the infusions, but there was no significant difference between the saline- and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-containing infusions. SCFA had no significant effect on serum insulin or c-peptide concentrations. However, compared with the saline control, the 180 mM solution resulted in a significant fall in serum free-fatty acids (FFA) and a significant rise in serum total cholesterol and triglyceride, with no change in beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. The data provide strong evidence that colonic SCFA are absorbed and metabolized in the human subject. The fall in FFA suggests that colonic SCFA have an effect on carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, the data provide indirect evidence for utilization of SCFA for lipid synthesis.\r"

  ".U": "89371675\r", 
  ".W": "Transverse loop colostomies are commonly used to \"protect\" low colorectal anastomoses after anterior resection for rectal carcinoma. However, anastomotic leaks occur despite proximal decompression. We studied 61 consecutive patients who underwent anterior resection to evaluate the cost of loop colostomy as reflected by morbidity, mortality, and length of post-operative hospital stay. Colostomy patients had significantly greater blood loss (736 vs. 500 ml, p = 0.004), more blood transfusions (1.55 units vs. 0.41 units, p less than 0.001), and longer operations (238 vs. 193 min, p = 0.005). They were also older (68 vs. 65, p = 0.13), had lesions closer to the anal verge (10.2 vs. 11.4 cm, p = 0.07), and had more infectious complications (13.6% vs. 2.6%, 0.05 less than p less than 0.1) than patients without colostomies. Colostomy was not related to sex or stage. There were no anastomotic leaks among those with colostomies and only one among those without colostomies; there were no associated mortalities. Patients with colostomies stayed an additional 10 days, on average, when readmitted for colostomy closure. The 22 patients who received loop colostomies had postoperative stays averaging one-third longer than patients without colostomies (16 vs. 12 days, p = 0.004). In both groups, the 8th postoperative day was the mean for resumption of a regular diet; all patients were eating a regular diet by the 12th postoperative day. The delay in discharging colostomy patients was due to the additional time necessary for patients to learn to change their appliance and irrigate their stoma. Proximal diverting colostomies may more than double the total dollar cost of anterior resection, although DRG reimbursement is the same with or without a colostomy. This additional cost could be reduced by initiating ostomy teaching in the preoperative period and by reducing the use of unnecessary colostomies.\r"

Patients with severe attacks were examined without prior preparation (two examinations). When the attack was mild to moderate (11 examinations), or the patient was in remission (seven examinations), two saline enemas were given up to 1 h before examination. There was a favorable correlation between the endoscopic and light microscopic features in 94.7% of the biopsies (total number of biopsies, 76). The electron microscope findings greatly exceeded those observed by light microscope and indicated that the major abnormality resides within the colonic epithelial cells. Distinctive ultrastructural changes were present both in apparently uninvolved (endoscopically and histologically) parts of colon and in inactive stages of ulcerative colitis. These findings suggest that colonic mucosal involvement may be universal, persist during clinical remission, and precede the light microscopic findings. They also support the importance of maintenance therapy.\r"

The contribution of the laparoscopic findings to patient management and the predictive value of the laparoscopic diagnosis compared to histology were assessed. Laparoscopy had a 95% diagnostic yield. Liver surface characteristic consistent with malignancy, cirrhosis, or fibrosis were sensitive and specific predictors of histologic findings. We conclude that laparoscopy continues to be a valuable diagnostic procedure, especially in cases where accurate assessment of the liver architecture is required.\r"

After both 2 and 3 wk of treatment, C. pylori was cleared in 70% (7/10) of BSS-treated patients, compared with 10% (1/10) of patients on placebo (p less than 0.05) at 2 wk and 0% (0/10) of patients on placebo at 3 wk (p less than 0.01). A significant improvement in histologic gastritis (p less than 0.05) was noted after 2 and 3 wk of treatment in the group receiving BSS. Gastritis improvement was a result of both reduced polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cell infiltration. Clearance of C. pylori was highly correlated with improvement of histologic gastritis (p less than 0.001). In addition, mucus depletion scores were significantly improved in the BSS-treated group. These data indicate that treatment with BSS provides short-term clearance of C. pylori in antral mucosa, and this clearance is associated with an improvement in histologic gastritis. These findings support the pathogenic role of C. pylori in histologic antral gastritis.\r"

Utilizing flow cytometry on endoscopic biopsies, we have attempted to characterize the prevalence of aneuploidy and to investigate the prognostic implications of gastric biopsy DNA content with regard to survival. DNA aneuploidy was detected in 71% of specimens revealing malignancy by histologic evaluation. When aneuploidy was demonstrated, 63% of the specimens proved to be positive for malignancy (positive predictive value). However, the absence of aneuploidy had a negative predictive value for malignancy of 93%. Patients with diploid adenocarcinomas had a median survival of 32 months, compared to a median survival of 4 months in the group with DNA aneuploidy. Conclusions: 1) The prevalence of aneuploidy in endoscopically obtained specimens compares favorably with other previously reported series. 2) The presence of aneuploidy in gastric malignancies appears to correlate with decreased survival and may be helpful in making therapeutic decisions.\r"

No patient had a normal 3-cpm EGG pattern. After 6 months of domperidone treatment, mean upper gastrointestinal symptoms scores decreased from 17.8 to 3.7 (p less than 0.01), and normal 3-cpm EGG frequencies were recorded from each of the six patients. The mean percentage of meal retained at 120 min decreased but did not improve significantly. Thus, establishment of normal 3-cpm gastric myoelectric activity and resolution of dysrhythmias, not normalization of emptying rates, was associated with improvement in upper gastrointestinal symptoms in these diabetic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Cigarette smoking is thought to adversely affect gastroesophageal reflux. Eight male patients with endoscopic evidence of gastroesophageal reflux had 24-h esophageal pH monitoring while smoking at least 20 cigarettes. This was repeated while abstaining from smoking the following day. In the initial study period, 28.3% of the reflux time occurred within 20 min of smoking a cigarette. There were fewer reflux episodes in the nonsmoking period (95.7 episodes vs 70.0). The patients had significant improvement while in the upright position (57 reflux episodes vs 28.5). Yet, total reflux time was not significantly changed (pH less than 4.0 11.2% of total time smoking vs 10.1% total time nonsmoking). Immediate cessation of smoking decreases the number of daily reflux episodes, but does not significantly affect total esophageal acid exposure in symptomatic patients with endoscopic evidence of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.\r"

In accordance with the results of direct smear microscopic examination and culture of esophageal brushings, patients were divided into three groups: positive, negative, and the patients, in whom saprophytic forms were detected. A higher prevalence of positive findings was noted in patients with predisposing factors for yeast invasion than in patients free of underlying disease. Eleven percent of patients with an endoscopically normal appearing esophagus were positive. We have the impression that this situation may represent a preclinical condition of fungal esophagitis. Patients treated with H2-blocking agents showed a significantly higher incidence of positive findings, than did those without such treatment. Whether patients suffering from a refluxesophagitis resistant to long-term treatment with H2 blockers, but with a significant colonization by yeasts, could benefit by an additional treatment with antimycotics remains a controversial issue and should be studied in a controlled way.\r"

Hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome is a rare condition of renovascular hypertension characterized by electrolyte abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypokalemia), polyuria, and high renin activity. In this patient a marked increase in urinary protein excretion was observed. Treatment with enalapril normalized BP, corrected electrolyte abnormalities, and reduced proteinuria. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), and the clearance of neutral dextrans of graded sizes were measured before and after 6 months of enalapril (20 mg/d) administration. Theoretical analysis of dextran and inulin clearance data with a model of glomerular size selectivity were adopted to separate effects of hemodynamic changes on macromolecule filtration from changes of intrinsic membrane selective properties. After enalapril urinary protein excretion decreased, GFR was unchanged and RPF almost doubled. Fractional clearance values of dextran molecules were markedly elevated in comparison with the corresponding values measured in a group of normal controls and were normalized by enalapril. Theoretical calculation of membrane pore characteristics showed that enalapril treatment reduced the radius of all membrane pores by approximately 1 nm. Altogether these results indicate that enalapril normalized glomerular filtration of neutral macromolecules and circulating proteins in a human condition of angiotensin II-induced proteinuria. Enalapril effectively restored glomerular size-selective function, reducing dimensions of membrane pores, independently of its effect on renal hemodynamics.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of repeated instillation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution on the peritoneal clearance of a Staphylococcus epidermidis challenge was investigated in a mouse model of surgically induced chronic renal failure. For periods of up to 2 weeks, mice bearing peritoneal catheter implants underwent daily (3 mL) or twice daily (1.5 mL) peritoneal instillation of PD solution (4.25% dextrose) by transcutaneous injection into the catheter lumen. Peritoneal instillation of PD solution did not have a significant influence on the microbiological status of peritoneal structures of renal failure or sham-operated mice following experimental intracatheter S epidermidis inoculation with 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) (assessment 48 hours after inoculation) or 10(8) CFU (assessment 1 week after inoculation). Microbiological and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) assessments of recovered peritoneal catheters demonstrated that S epidermidis remained associated with the catheter site after other peritoneal structures had become culture negative. SEM of the parietal peritoneum revealed striking morphologic alterations of the mesothelial surface as a consequence of daily PD solution infusion. In the absence of S epidermidis inoculation, repeated instillation of PD solution caused a marked acute peritoneal inflammation without evidence of a concomitant systemic inflammatory response. Furthermore, peritoneal inflammatory response to S epidermidis challenge was augmented by the infusion procedure. Concurrent assessments of inflammatory response and microbiological status revealed that, in spite of heightened peritoneal inflammatory response with peritoneal infusion, bacterial clearance from the catheter site was not improved. Although the animal preparation was limited to peritoneal infusion without drainage, the influence of repeated peritoneal instillation of hyperosmolar, acidic PD solution on the response of mice to S epidermidis challenge was successfully addressed.\r"

The effect of lead was concentration dependent (r = 0.998, P less than 0.001). These observations suggest that abnormalities in sodium transport are involved in the pathogenesis of lead-induced hypertension. Because increased red cell sodium-lithium countertransport is characteristic of essential hypertension, these observations further suggest that lead-induced and essential hypertension may share common pathophysiological mechanisms.\r"

The patient presented with hypertension, modest reduction of glomerular filtration, proteinuria, microhematuria, cylindruria, and moderate harmonic hypoplasia of the right kidney on angiography. Glomeruli had no immune deposits on immunohistology. Light microscopy showed widening of the mesangial axis, focal segmental glomerular sclerosis, and renal interstitial fibrosis with occasional foam cells. This case shows that the spectrum of renal abnormalities in the acrorenal syndrome is wider than previously noted.\r"

The overall goal of our research has been to identify the precise molecular defects in patients with ADA-deficient SCID. In this study, we focused on a patient whom we found to have normal sized ADA mRNA by Northern analysis and an intact ADA structural gene by Southern analysis. By cloning and sequencing this patient's ADA cDNA, we found a C-to-T point mutation in exon 11. This resulted in the amino acid substitution of a valine for an alanine at position 329 of the ADA protein. Sequence analysis revealed that this mutation created a new BalI restriction site. Using Southern analyses, we were able to directly screen individuals to determine the frequency of this mutation. By combining data on eight families followed at our institution with data on five other families reported in the literature, we established that five of 13 patients (seven of 22 alleles) with known or suspected point mutations have this defect. This mutation was found to be associated with three different ADA haplotypes. This argues against a founder effect and suggests that the mutation is very old. In summary, a conservative amino acid substitution is found in a high proportion of patients with ADA deficiency; this can easily be detected by Southern analysis.\r"

Linkage studies were done in 49 informative DMD families by using the LINKAGE program. Crossing-over between the loci studied occurred in four families. A recombination rate of 4% (support interval [Zmax-1] 1%-10%), which was 54 (support interval 14-135-fold) times higher than expected, was found with a maximum lod score of 13.50. These data suggest a hot spot for recombination within DXS164.\r"

  ".W": "Maternal isodisomy for chromosome 7 was observed in a 4-year-old cystic fibrosis patient with very short stature. In an examination of 11 DNA polymorphisms spanning the entire length of chromosome 7, no paternal contribution could be shown in seven informative loci. Paternity was examined with probes for five polymorphic loci on the Y chromosome, for the pseudo beta-globin locus on chromosome 11 and by Jeffreys's hypervariable probes. The results with the latter gave a probability of 3.7 x 10(-9) for nonpaternity. Chromosomal examination revealed a centromeric heteromorphism of chromosome 7 in the mother, for which the proband was homozygous. Isodisomy of the patient was thus shown for the entire length of a maternal chromosome 7. The mechanisms leading to this isodisomy involve at least two events of abnormal cell division, events that may be meiotic, postzygotic, or both. This proband is the second reported maternal isodisomy; both were detected through homozygosity for CF. Both patients had short stature, which could have been caused by parental imprinting, since similar results have been observed in isodisomic mice. Homozygosity due to uniparental descent in man should be kept in mind as a mechanism for recessive disorders, especially for chromosome 7.\r"

This cDNA was used to probe RNAs isolated from a variety of tissues to investigate tissue-specific regulation and to determine whether histatins might play a role other than in the oral cavity. The same probe was also used for Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA restricted with various enzymes, and it showed that the genes coding for histatins are on the same chromosome. In situ hybridization of the cDNA probe to metaphase chromosome spreads was performed to determine chromosomal location of the genes for histatins. A genomic fragment isolated using the cDNA probe was also hybridized to chromosome spreads, and the same chromosome was identified. The genes for histatins are located on chromosome 4, band q13. We have shown that three histatin mRNAs are expressed in human parotid and submandibular glands but in none of the other tissues studied. These results suggest that histatins are specific to salivary secretions.\r"

The expected LOD score and the distribution of the LOD score have been worked out for various scenarios. It is found that the expected numbers of families to be sampled for detection of linkage are within feasible limits if the recombination fractions between the marker loci and the disorder loci are less than or equal to .1. The strategy of studying affected offspring only is shown to be more efficient than the strategy of studying both affected and normal offspring. The efficiency of the \"affecteds-only\" strategy (1) increases with increase in sibship size, (2) decreases with increase in population prevalence of the disorder, and (3) increases with increase in recombination distances between the marker and the disorder loci. From various considerations, it is found that sampling families of sibship size three with at least one affected, and adopting the affecteds-only strategy for analysis, may be an optimal strategy.\r"

The present study provides evidence that the MAO genes are not disrupted in \"classic\" Norrie disease patients. Genomic DNA from these \"nondeletion\" Norrie disease patients did not show rearrangements at the MAOA or DXS7 loci. Normal levels of MAO-A activities, as well as normal amounts and size of the MAO-A mRNA, were observed in cultured skin fibroblasts from these patients, and MAO-B activity in their platelets was normal. Catecholamine metabolites evaluated in plasma and urine were in the control range. Thus, although some atypical Norrie disease patients lack both MAO-A and MAO-B activities, MAO does not appear to be an etiologic factor in classic Norrie disease.\r"

  ".U": "89371750\r", 
  ".W": "The nosology of the inborn errors of myelin metabolism has been stymied by the lack of molecular genetic analysis. Historically, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease has encompassed a host of neurologic disorders that present with a deficit of myelin, the membrane elaborated by glial cells that encircles and successively enwraps axons. We describe here a Pelizaeus-Merzbacher pedigree of the classical type, with X-linked inheritance, a typical clinical progression, and a pathologic loss of myelinating cells and myelin in the central nervous system. To discriminate variants of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, a set of oligonucleotide primers was constructed to polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) amplify and sequence the gene encoding proteolipid protein (PLP), a structural protein that comprises half of the protein of the myelin sheath. The PLP gene in one of two affected males and the carrier mother of this family exhibited a single base difference in the more than 2 kb of the PLP gene sequenced, a C----T transition that would create a serine substitution for proline at the carboxy end of the protein. Our results delineate the clinical features of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, define the possible molecular pathology of this dysmyelinating disorder, and address the molecular classification of inborn errors of myelin metabolism. Patients with the classical form (type I) and the more severely affected, connatal variant of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (type II) would be predicted to display mutation at the PLP locus. The other variants (types III-VI), which have sometimes been categorized as Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, may represent mutations in genes encoding other structural myelin proteins or proteins critical to myelination.\r"

By GAWTS more than 100,000 bp of sequence have been generated from eight regions of the factor IX gene, which include the putative promoter region, the coding region, and the splice junctions. All eight regions were examined in 20 unrelated normal individuals of defined ethnicity and subsequently in 22 hemophiliacs in different families. The following three major conclusions emerge: (1) The rate of polymorphism in these eight regions of functional significance has been measured in an X-linked gene, and it is about one-third of the average rate observed for intronic and intergenic sequences on the X chromosome. The rate is low enough that the causative mutation should be the only sequence change seen in the overwhelming majority of hemophiliacs. (2) Transitions of CpG account for 31% (5/16) of the distinct mutations and for 38% (5/13) of the single-base changes. The rate of transitions at CpG is elevated by an estimated 77-fold, presumably owing to lack of repair of thymidine generated by the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytidine. (3) High-quality, reproducible sequence data can be obtained on a time scale that makes direct carrier testing and prenatal diagnosis feasible.\r"

The results of bivariate segregation analysis revealed no systematic evidence for heterozygous expression either in the biochemical domain of LCAP abnormalities or in increased liability to overt symptomatic disease. Joint consideration of the quantitative variable with hemochromatosis affection status allowed clear resolution of a recessive single-gene inheritance pattern in these families.\r"

This misuse was then analyzed with respect to hospital charges and length of stay (LOS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 70 patients (average age, 58.5 years) who had not undergone bone marrow transplantation. Patient charts were reviewed daily for the following information: clinical signs and symptoms of infection, pertinent laboratory data, culture results, detailed data on each antimicrobial in every antimicrobial regimen and their appropriateness, hospital charges, LOS, diagnostic and procedure codes, and discharge status. Three severity of illness variables were generated. Inappropriate antimicrobial use was described according to one of 12 categories. RESULTS: The percent of antimicrobial misuse, defined as the proportion of days of administration of antimicrobials on which one or more antimicrobials were judged inappropriate, was found to be 22.3%. After adjustment for severity of illness and diagnosis, this average inappropriateness correlated with 4.2 additional hospitalization days and $5,368 additional hospital charges. CONCLUSION: Our results cannot distinguish among several possible reasons for these associations, including direct causality (e.g., toxicity and prolonged hospitalization for antimicrobial use) and indirect links such as inappropriate utilization of other resources and influences of severity of illness on antimicrobial use not accounted for in our equations. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the association gives import to the desirability of further studies.\r"

  ".W": "INTRODUCTION: Recently, the use of pentamidine has risen because of its efficacy in managing patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Pneumocystis carinii infection. We undertook a retrospective analysis of the charts of 22 patients with AIDS given pentamidine when they were hospitalized over a two-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Collectively, these 22 patients were admitted 28 times during this period and received a total of 23 courses of pentamidine. During five of these admissions, pentamidine was not given. The duration of therapy ranged from five to 33 days (mean: 13.4 days). Three admissions were excluded because of insufficient laboratory data or concomitant use of therapies that could affect the parameters being studied. RESULTS: In 19 of the remaining 20 admissions, the patients treated with pentamidine were observed to have elevations of potassium (5.1 to 8.7 mEq/L), creatinine (1.5 to 11.8 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen (27 to 183 mg/dL), and a decrease in serum bicarbonate (14 to 21 mEq/L). Of the 19 patients exhibiting these abnormalities, most required sodium polystyrene sulfonate and two required dialysis. During the admissions when pentamidine was not given, hyperkalemia was not observed. After discontinuation of pentamidine therapy, these metabolic derangements normalized in all patients except for one who died while still in acute renal failure. Four patients received more than one course of therapy and upon reinstitution of pentamidine treatment, the same metabolic abnormalities recurred. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, pentamidine is more nephrotoxic in patients with AIDS than previously reported in other subjects and can cause life-threatening hyperkalemia.\r"

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The posterior neck of every child in the sixth and eighth grades of the public schools of Galveston, Texas, was personally examined by the investigators during a state-mandated school health survey. A total of 1,412 children were examined. RESULTS: The data for each child examined included the absence or presence of acanthosis nigricans, height, weight, age, sex, and ethnic background. A subset of the children with the skin lesion also had fasting plasma insulin levels measured. Acanthosis nigricans was present in 7.1% of the 1,412 children examined. The skin lesion was equally distributed between boys and girls and was most common among children with severe obesity. The condition was present in two of 440 white non-Hispanics, 19 of 343 Hispanics, and 80 of 601 blacks examined. The fasting plasma insulin concentrations measured in some of these children and in previously evaluated subjects strongly correlate with the presence and severity of the acanthosis nigricans skin lesion. CONCLUSIONS: This skin lesion is much more common than previously believed and has a dramatic ethnic predisposition. We conclude that the high prevalence of this skin lesion further suggests that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, with all of their serious medical implications, are also highly prevalent.\r"

METHODS: Meta-analysis was used to analyze data obtained from a search of English language reports of trials of cimetidine in the ambulatory treatment of acute acid-peptic disorders that were published between January 1982 and April 1987. RESULTS: Of 161 trials of cimetidine that we identified, 84 provided complete reporting of data on adverse reactions and, of these, 24 employed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Across these 24 trials, the overall rate of reported adverse reactions among 622 patients randomly assigned to receive cimetidine was 10.9%; the corresponding rate among 516 patients randomly assigned to receive placebo was 10.1%. This difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.10), nor were any significant differences noted in the frequencies of reported central nervous system or gastrointestinal adverse reactions (p greater than 0.10). Rates of adverse reactions also did not differ by dosage or trial duration. The overall rate of adverse reactions reported in the 60 trials that did not utilize a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was similar to the rate reported in those that did. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the frequency of adverse reactions among patients receiving cimetidine for acute acid-peptic disorders is not significantly different from that of patients receiving placebo.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Superoxide dismutase (orgotein for injection) has been used in managing osteoarthritis for more than seven years in Europe; however, well-controlled studies to establish an optimum dosage regimen have not been conducted. In this study, three orgotein dose/regimens were compared with placebo in terms of efficacy, safety, and duration of effect in patients with active osteoarthritis of the knee. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 139 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were enrolled in the study. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were withdrawn to induce a flare of disease activity. Patients were then randomly assigned to receive one intra-articular injection of either placebo or orgotein (8 mg to 32 mg) each week for three weeks. Both investigators and patients evaluated disease activity and adverse experiences at a series of follow-up visits for three months. RESULTS: Orgotein was effective in reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis for up to three months after treatment; 16 mg given twice was the most effective and most best-tolerated regimen. Discomfort at the injection site was drug related, although this effect also occurred occasionally after injection of placebo. CONCLUSION: The long-lasting effects of intra-articular superoxide dismutase contribute to a favorable risk-benefit ratio and support the importance of the free-radical anion, superoxide (O2-), in the biochemical pathology of osteoarthritis.\r"

The second patient had bone lesions and a pathologic fracture. The third patient, with myelodysplasia, had diffuse skin lesions infiltrated with myeloblasts. These cases fit the diagnostic category of granulocytic sarcoma. Granulocytic sarcoma is a tumor of immature myeloid cells that may involve any site in the body but that most commonly affects the skin, soft tissues, lymph nodes, bone, and periosteum. Lesions can predate leukemia or occur late in an established chronic granulocytic leukemia or acute granulocytic leukemia. The most common presentation occurs late in the course of acute granulocytic leukemia or in chronic granulocytic leukemia as a herald to blastic transformation. Therapy for localized lesions is radiotherapy, which produces prompt shrinkage of the lesions but relapse occurs subsequently. Systemic chemotherapy also produces satisfactory clinical results. In all instances, therapy can only be considered palliative since virtually all patients have a short survival following the appearance of an extramedullary myeloblastic lesion. Recognition of this pathologic entity at an early stage may give us information on the best management for these patients.\r"

  ".W": "Viral hepatitis is the second most common reportable infectious disease in the United States, with hepatitis B accounting for about 45 percent of cases. Although approximately 25,000 cases of hepatitis B are reported to the Centers for Disease Control each year, it is estimated that there are actually about 300,000 annual infections (up from 200,000 in the early 1980s). This increase has occurred despite the availability of a safe and effective hepatitis B vaccine since 1982. Hepatitis B occurs primarily in young adults because of lifestyle or occupationally related exposure. Reported cases in homosexual men have decreased, probably because of changes in behavior related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic. Cases due to heterosexual transmission and intravenous drug use are increasing. The proportion of cases in health care workers has decreased, possibly because 30 to 40 percent of high-risk health care workers have been vaccinated. Because of the increase in hepatitis B infection, the strategy of controlling this disease by vaccinating high-risk groups must be reconsidered. Alternative strategies include selective or universal immunization of infants or adolescents. Although integrating hepatitis B vaccine into infant immunization programs takes advantage of the existing system, it would not lead to measurable disease reduction for two decades. Immunizing adolescents would more rapidly reduce the incidence of hepatitis B, but currently no structured health care setting reaches them.\r"

A recombinant vaccine, which can be supplied in unlimited amounts, was recently introduced. Based on current data, these vaccines are highly effective and safe. The most effective procedures for controlling hepatitis B virus is the vaccination of newborn infants. After universal vaccination of newborns has been ensured, vaccination of susceptible persons in older age groups could be instituted. Any attempt at eradicating hepatitis B virus will require international cooperation, and ideally the hepatitis B virus vaccine should be integrated into other childhood vaccination programs.\r"

  ".W": "Mentally handicapped clients in institutions are at high risk for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In 1985, 770 mentally handicapped residents from four institutions in the Antwerp area were screened for HBV markers. The prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen was 10.3 percent (range, 6.1 to 15.2 percent); 42.3 percent (range, 11.5 to 60.1 percent) had antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen and the hepatitis B core antigen. In 1986, 275 seronegative mentally handicapped residents were vaccinated intramuscularly in the deltoid region with 20 micrograms (1.0 ml) of a recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid yeast-derived hepatitis B vaccine (Engerix-B, SmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) on a zero-, one-, six-month schedule. Serum samples were collected at Months 1, 2, 7, 12, and 24 and were tested for HBV markers by radioimmunoassay. The seroconversion rates for hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies were 39 percent at Month 1 (geometric mean concentration, 6.4 IU/liter), 82 percent at Month 2 (geometric mean concentration, 23.4 IU/liter), 97 percent at Month 7 (geometric mean concentration, 1,034 IU/liter), and 96 percent at Month 12 (geometric mean concentration, 269 IU/liter). Among the 214 residents evaluated at Month 12, 69 percent had hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 100 IU/liter (geometric mean concentration, 603 IU/liter). No significant adverse reactions were observed. Within the first seven months of observation, HBV infection was detected in eight of 271 subjects (estimated annual incidence of 5 percent). During this period, none of the clients developed clinical hepatitis or showed biochemical evidence of liver damage. Between eight and 24 months, no additional HBV infections were detected. These data can be compared with an annual incidence of HBV infection of 8.7 percent in a historical cohort of mentally handicapped residents in one of the four institutions.\r"

The majority of infants who acquire the virus during the perinatal period and become HBV carriers have no clinical symptoms. However, there are reports of acute and fulminant hepatitis and even primary liver cancer occurring in a few HBsAg-positive infants. Immunoprophylaxis given to infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers at birth with a combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and hepatitis B vaccine is the most effective means of preventing the chronic HBV carrier state and its potential complications. In a multicenter trial in the United States, 85 to 90 percent of the children of HBsAg-positive mothers remained HBsAg-negative when treated with this combination regimen. Studies conducted outside the United States have yielded similar results. Other investigations indicate that the hepatitis B vaccine alone may be of value in preventing perinatal transmission of HBV in developing countries that are unable to afford hepatitis B immunoglobulin.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection was determined using sera from persons participating in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 1976 to 1980. Of 14,488 scientifically selected participants aged 12 to 74, 821 had evidence of past or present infection with HBV. In the white population, the weighted estimate of hepatitis B infection was 3.2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 3.1 to 4.2). A steady increase with age was seen; by ages 65 to 74, the prevalence was 6.9 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 5.2 to 8.5). In the black population, the overall weighted estimate of prevalence was 13.7 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 11.6 to 15.8). In this racial group, there was a dramatic increase with age, with the oldest age groups having a prevalence of 39.6 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29.1 to 50.0). In both racial groups, there was a low prevalence of infection in young children that began to rise between ages 12 and 18. In a multivariate analysis of factors associated with infection, there was an interaction of race with age; therefore, the odds ratio for race is presented for four ages. This ratio ranged from 3.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 4.2) for a 15-year-old to 8.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 6.5 to 10.3) for a 70-year-old. These relative odds estimates were not substantially affected by adjustment for the available information on risk factors for HBV infection. The results of this study in a representative sample of the United States population show that adult black Americans are at high risk for hepatitis B infection. Other independent predictors of HBV positivity include male sex; residing in the South, Northeast, or West; residing in a city of 250,000 or more people; serving in the armed forces; living below the poverty level; and having a positive treponemal test for syphilis. These data suggest that the immunization practices for controlling this disease should be re-examined.\r"

Male gender, black race, severe myopia, and Krukenberg spindles were identified as possible risk factors. Men were predominant in this population 75 (67.6%); the diagnosis was made in men at an earlier age; they had a higher proportion in the glaucoma group; and they required more aggressive glaucoma therapy. There were only four black patients, but all required surgery. Patients in the glaucoma group had significantly more severe myopia and a higher incidence of Krukenberg spindles. These risk factors may help to identify which patients with the pigment dispersion syndrome require closer follow-up or the possible initiation of prophylactic therapy.\r"

Light and electron microscopic examination demonstrated glaucomatous optic atrophy with loss of ganglion cells.

We believe this family has an autosomal dominant genetic condition that is a distinct type of low-tension glaucoma.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging may distinguish, noninvasively, symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers of cavernous angiomas and further delineate their inheritance patterns. Asymptomatic cavernous angiomas of the central nervous system are best followed without intervention, whereas symptomatic patients should be treated on an individual basis, depending on the location of lesion and the risk of surgical removal.\r"

All of these cases included indolent ulcers that occurred almost exclusively in elderly patients (mean age, 72 years; range, 11 to 92 years). All patients had preexisting ocular conditions that compromised the corneal surface such as exposed corneal sutures, eyelid surgery, aphakic extended wear contact lenses, viral keratitis, and diabetes mellitus. No other pathogens were isolated. All infections responded well to antibiotic therapy with all organisms sensitive to cefazolin and all but one sensitive to gentamicin.\r"

  ".W": "Between February 1974 and August 1987, we treated 67 retinoblastomas in 47 eyes of 45 patients with cryotherapy (triple freeze-thaw technique). Overall, cryotherapy eradicated 53 (79%) of the tumors, whereas additional treatment with episcleral plaque radiotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, or enucleation was necessary in 14 (21%) of the tumors. Tumor destruction was achieved with one or more cryotherapy treatments in all cases in which the tumor was no greater than 2.5 mm in diameter and 1.0 mm in thickness, and in which the tumor was confined to the sensory retina without seeding into the adjacent vitreous humor. We therefore recommend cryotherapy in such cases. Cryotherapy alone failed in 14 larger tumors, ten of which had clinical evidence of vitreous seeding by tumor cells. Cryotherapy is therefore contraindicated in cases of vitreous seeding or if the tumor exceeds 3.5 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in thickness. Cryotherapy can be successful for tumors up to 3.5 mm in diameter and 2.0 mm in thickness, but more than one treatment may be necessary.\r"

The laser tomographic scanner is a new method that allows measurements of the topography of the internal limiting membrane in the macular area and may improve our understanding of the pathophysiologic characteristics and treatment of a variety of disorders of the macula.\r"

The type of surgery performed (vitrectomy or scleral buckle), gender, age, lens status, and a history of diabetes or previous intraocular surgery were assessed and the addition of flurbiprofen to routine preoperative dilation did not significantly affect the mean change in pupil size for any of these subgroups. Of the nine patients who developed at least 3 mm of miosis, five received flurbiprofen and four did not. Use of flurbiprofen did not appear to reduce intraoperative miosis during vitreoretinal surgery in a clinically meaningful manner.\r"

Additionally, surgical specimens of fresh unfixed synovial tissues from patients with RA also demonstrated immunoreactivity. At the light microscopic level, both HTLV-I antigens were detected in approximately 45% of the rheumatoid synovial tissues by the immunocolloidal gold method with silver enhancement (IGSS) and the avidin-biotin-complex technique (ABC), whereas six of eight of the frozen RA specimens stained positive by immunofluorescence. Patients whose synovial tissues were immunoreactive by immunofluorescence were seronegative to HTLV-I antigens as determined by ELISA and immunoblotting. Conversely, cases with osteoarthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Dupuytren's contracture, and gangrene were shown to be nonreactive by immunohistochemistry. The results indicate that expression of antigens is related to or crossreactive with HTLV-I in synovial tissues from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies raised to the 80 kd glycoprotein component of the cell to cell adhesion molecule cell-CAM 120/80 were used to map its distribution immunohistochemically in normal human tissues and in benign and malignant tumors. Cell-CAM 120/80 was found in all normal epithelial tissues, but was not expressed on neural, lymphoid, smooth, striated and cardiac muscle, connective tissue, or the germ cells in either sex. The expression of this adhesion molecule was polarized in ductal and glandular epithelia and evenly circumferential in squamous and transitional epithelia. Some organs, such as the kidney, liver and endocrine glands, showed unique organ to tissue specific patterns. Maturation-dependent loss of cell-CAM 120/80 was noticed in superficial layers of squamous epithelium and the placenta. Benign epithelial tumors expressed cell-CAM 120/80 in a manner comparable with their tissue of origin. Malignant tumors expressed cell-CAM 120/80 either in a manner similar to the tissue of their origin or assumed a less polarized phenotype. Overall, the immunoreactivity in many malignant tumors appeared weaker and the polarization was less pronounced. Thus, cell-CAM 120/80 is a universal marker of human epithelial cells, but its mode of expression differs in various anatomic sites, and may be influenced by maturation or malignant transformation of cells.\r"

A distinct regional variation was seen in the expression of blood group A, B, Lewis(b), and extended Lewis(y) antigens, which were expressed predominantly in the right colon, whereas Lewis(a), Lewis(y), and H-type 2 were prevalent throughout. Lewis(x) and X-like antigens were only occasionally expressed. Two antibodies against sialylated Lewis(a) showed different staining patterns, with CA19.9 positive in only two biopsies and CO29.11 intensely positive in most. Two of the three antibodies detecting carcinoembryonic antigen epitopes (3d6 and COL-4) stained many biopsies, whereas COL-12 was rarely detected. No regional gradient was found in the expression of the other antigens studied (B72.3, ME491; GA73.3, ND1, and ND4). This mapping data will provide an important baseline for future studies of epitope distribution in the colon in premalignant and neoplastic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (CLH) is a disorder characterized by the development of one or more skin lesions containing dense lymphoid infiltrates that exhibit the histopathologic features of a benign, reactive process. Nevertheless, some cases have been associated with the subsequent development of clinically overt lymphomas. This suggests that monoclonal populations may exist in some cases of CLH and that these cases may represent a subset more likely to evolve into lymphoma. To determine if such a subset of CLH can be distinguished, Southern blot analysis of DNA was used to study the immunogenotypic features of lesions from 14 patients with clinical, histopathologic, and immunopathologic findings characteristic of CLH. Five cases exhibited detectable clonal rearrangements of immunoglobulin genes. Furthermore, one of these five cases evolved into overt diffuse large cell lymphoma of B cell lineage during a 2-year follow-up of recurrent disease at the original cutaneous site. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangements of this lymphoma were identical to those of the prior CLH lesion. There was no evidence of detectable t(14;18) chromosomal translocations or clonal rearrangements of the beta gene of the T cell receptor in any case. It was concluded that CLH can be divided into two subsets based on the presence or absence of a clonal B cell population, and that overt lymphoma can arise from the former subset and contain the same B cell clone identified in the pre-existent CLH lesion.\r"

A high proportion of mice developed pleomorphic spindle cell tumors and epidermal neoplasms of various types. These spindle cell tumors were studied by immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase techniques and by electron microscopy. Freshly isolated tumor cells were grown in tissue culture. Immunocytochemical analysis showed varying expression of markers of mesenchymal differentiation: vimentin, procollagens I and III, type I collagen, and lysozyme. Electron microscopy showed spindled and cuboidal cells with abundant endoplasmic reticulum, filopodia, and lysosomes, but no intercellular connections. The cells grown in vitro were cuboidal and stellate and also showed mesenchymal differentiation by electron microscopy. These results are perhaps similar to those described for a human actinically produced fibrohistiocytic neoplasm, atypical fibroxanthoma, and this system may provide a useful model of ultraviolet-induced dermal neoplasia.\r"

In active, but not inactive, MS plaques vessel fibronectin was increased (to approximately 57% of Factor VIII+ vessels) over uninvolved MS and normal control white matter (P less than 0.001 for both). Fibronectin was primarily localized to vessel walls and amount of staining correlated with degree of inflammation. Active plaques and necrotic lesions also had extracellular fibronectin and fibrin/ogen. These molecules and the fibronectin receptor were found on macrophages. Albumin was more widely and diffusely distributed in lesions than fibronectin. Thus, in addition to extravasation from damaged vessels, fibronectin may be deposited on or synthesized by endothelial cells and macrophages in the CNS. Fibronectin could facilitate monocyte adhesion to endothelial cell luminal surfaces, promote migration of mononuclear cells, and enhance myelin phagocytosis in MS lesions.\r"

  ".W": "These studies were designed to assess pathophysiologic factors responsible for increased vascular permeability occurring in rat skin that has been thermally injured in vivo. Under the conditions employed, permeability changes and edema formation progressed over time, with peak changes occurring 60 minutes after thermal trauma. The plasma of thermally injured rats showed dramatic increases in levels of xanthine oxidase activity, with peak values appearing as early as 15 minutes after thermal trauma. Excision of the burned skin immediately after thermal injury significantly diminished the increase in plasma xanthine oxidase activity. The skin permeability changes were attenuated by treatment of animals with antioxidants (catalase, superoxide dismutase [SOD], dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO], dimethylthiourea [DMTU]) or an iron chelator (deferoxamine), supporting the role of oxygen radicals in the development of vascular injury as defined by greatly increased vascular permeability. Studies employing laser Doppler velocimetry in thermally injured skin revealed a pronounced and sustained decrease in blood flow after thermal trauma, a pattern not affected by protective interventions. The failure of neutrophil depletion to protect against the vascular permeability changes and the protective effects of the xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol and lodoxamide tromethamine) suggest that xanthine oxidase is the most likely source of the oxygen radicals involved in edema formation. Lodoxamide was found to have some hydroxyl radical (HO.) scavenging ability (greater than that of allopurinol) but no iron chelating activity. Some of the protective effects of lodoxamide and allopurinol may be linked to their HO. scavenging ability. These data suggest that, in this model of thermal trauma, vascular injury defined by increased vascular permeability is, in part, related to the activation of xanthine oxidase and the generation of toxic oxygen metabolites that damage microvascular endothelial cells.\r"

  ".U": "89371941\r", 
  ".W": "Many studies have shown that cultured rat liver epithelial cells can be neoplastically transformed by repeated or long-continued exposure to chemical carcinogens. These cells also may transform spontaneously in the absence of carcinogen treatment after long-term, continuous passage in culture or after chronic maintenance in a confluent state in vitro. In this study, we have compared the times of emergence and rates of accumulation of transformed cells in populations of rat hepatic epithelial cells exposed either to a single dose of N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG, 3 micrograms/ml culture medium for 30 minutes) or to acetone vehicle alone (3 microliters/ml culture medium for 30 minutes). Transformation was compared in cell populations that were passaged continuously once a week as they attained a confluent density (nonselective growth conditions), or that were maintained at a confluent density for 3 weeks between passages once a month (selective growth conditions). Emergence of both spontaneous transformants and transformants induced by MNNG was facilitated by selective growth conditions, as compared with non-selective growth conditions. Transformants were detected both in cultures exposed to MNNG and in cultures exposed only to acetone (solvent controls), but they always emerged earlier in cultures exposed to MNNG (nine population doublings earlier when grown under selective growth conditions and 22 population doublings earlier when grown under nonselective growth conditions). Once transformants were detected, they replaced the nontransformed population more quickly under selective than under nonselective conditions of culture. Cells possessing the ability to grow in soft agar and to produce tumors in syngeneic rats were detected (at about 12 population doublings after treatment) under selective conditions much earlier than under nonselective growth conditions (at about 90 population doublings after treatment). Among MNNG-treated cultures, the fraction of aneuploid cells in the population was correlated significantly with tumorigenicity. In contrast, among acetone-treated control populations, aneuploidy and tumorigenicity were not correlated; populations of aneuploid acetone-treated cells often were not tumorigenic. These observations suggest that MNNG treatment produced a specific type of aneuploidy that was associated with tumorigenicity.\r"

In contrast to cells from benign lesions, tumor cells of 51.2% of carcinomas had an abnormally low content of HLA-A, -B, and -C determinants ranging from reduction of antigenic density per cell (28.8%) over an incomplete (15.6%) to complete loss of antigens (6.8%). Associated with lymphohistiocytic stromal infiltrates, HLA-D/Ii determinants were found to be induced in benign duct and acinar epithelium after the order Ii greater than or equal to HLA-DR greater than or equal to HLA-DP greater than or equal to HLA-DQ. These antigens were also expressed, mostly noncoordinately, in 55.5% of carcinomas, and in 98 cases according to the above order. In 28.6%, Ii expression clearly exceeded HLA-D antigen expression; conversely, 6.2% contained HLA-DR+/Ii- tumor cell subsets. In breast carcinoma, the association of reduced HLA-A, -B, and -C expression and a noninduction of HLA-DR was highly significant (P less than 0.0009), suggesting an abnormal signal acting down-regulating on the expression of both classes of antigens. Because the modality of HLA-A, -B, and -C and HLA-D/Ii expression correlated with neither tumor type nor grade, it might be an independent parameter.\r"

Although coronary vasospasm has been proposed as a possible mechanism, the ability of cocaine to induce coronary spasm has not been conclusively demonstrated. In these studies, isolated rat hearts were perfused with cocaine (100 micrograms to 500 micrograms/ml) for 1 minute, perfusion-fixed with glutaraldehyde, and histologically assessed for evidence of coronary spasm through light and electron microscopy. Light micrographs revealed that cocaine induced spasm in coronary arterioles up to 65 microns in diameter, whereas larger caliber vessels did not constrict. Ultrastructurally, vacuolation was observed in the endothelial and smooth muscle cells of constricted arterioles. Endothelial integrity was maintained and interendothelial junctions remained intact. Morphologic evidence of constriction was supported by data obtained from Langendorff-heart preparations in which cocaine reduced myocardial flow rate under constant pressure conditions and increased aortic perfusion pressure under constant flow conditions. Spasm induced by cocaine was prevented by the calcium entry blocker nitrendipine, but not by phentolamine, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist. The finding of small vessel spasm in this study may explain the significant number of clinical cases of cocaine-associated AMI in which the main coronary arteries appear angiographically normal.\r"

  ".W": "This work characterizes the erythropoietic interplay of the spleen, blood, and bone marrow in a lethal murine malaria, strain 17XL P. yoelii. This malaria runs a fulminant 7 day course in BALB/c/ByJ mice, marked by high levels of parasitized reticulocytes with death likely due to anemia. We have quantitated the levels of burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E), the early, niche-seeking, largely erythropoietin-unresponsive erythropoietic precursors, and of colony forming units-erythroid (CFU-E), the more differentiated sessile erythropoietin-responsive precursors, in bone marrow, blood, and spleen, through the course of this malaria. A decline in marrow BFU-E began on day 2, but recovered, relatively, after day 3. Marrow cellularity declined, being but 75% normal on day 6. Spleen weight increased about 5-fold within 6 days with enlargement of erythroid, lymphoid, macrophage, and stromal compartments. Splenic BFU-E increased in the first 24 hr and 5-fold by day 6. Splenic CFU-E increased in the first 24 hr and into day 4. They then declined and showed a secondary, large-scale, sustained rise interrupted by death. Because the spleen was enlarging, a greater than 60-fold increase in the absolute number of splenic CFU-E occurred at the time of death. Marrow CFU-E followed the same pattern as splenic CFU-E, but the terminal increase represented but a 4-fold absolute increase because of declining marrow cellularity. High levels of erythropoietin occurred only late in the course of disease, likely in response to profound anemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The splenic response in lethal 17XL Plasmodium yoelii murine malaria is vigorous, displaying marked phagocytosis, erythropoiesis, lymphopoiesis, plasmacytopoiesis, and, from day 3 of infection, increasing levels of parasitized erythrocytes. There is also a pronounced response of newly characterized fibroblastic stromal cells which branch and fuse with one another, forming extensive, complex, irregular, syncytial membranous sheets which provide a variety of barriers. Hence, I term these barrier cells (BC), and their fusion results in barrier-forming complexes (BFC). BC form adherent surfaces, trapping parasitized erythrocytes and monocytes-macrophages, facilitating phagocytosis. They envelop single plasma cells, erythrocytes, erythroblasts, lymphocytes, reticulocytes, monocytes-macrophages, or clusters of them. They surround blood vessels, forming blood-spleen barriers. They are insinuated into the circumferential reticulum at the periphery of white pulp, isolating white pulp. They form channels in red pulp, directing blood flow. They are associated with collagen. There appear to be several sources of BC. They may originate by activation of established reticular cells which form the filtration beds, by activation of reticular cells covering the pulp surface of capsule and trabeculae, and as a major source in this malaria, from circulating progenitors entering the splenic pulp from the vasculature. In non-lethal malaria, these barrier systems protect splenic reticulocytes from parasitization. In the lethal 17XL malaria they do not, and there follows a considerable increase in parasitization in the spleen with a corresponding increase in active macrophages. Large-scale parasitization and parasite recycling through the great stores of splenic reticulocytes in the lethal malaria, and the failure of parasitization of these splenic reticulocytes reserves on the non-lethal malaria, suggests that the actions of the spleen aggravate the lethal malaria and ameliorate the non-lethal. This is supported by the finding that non-lethal malaria is aggravated and lethal malaria ameliorated by splenectomy.\r"

Blood eosinophil responses during the 5 weeks subsequent to this attempt to reinfect were much lower than those of comparable naive animals, while the response to a heterologous infection (Toxocara canis) was comparable to that of controls. Mebendazole was given to infected animals for 2 weeks beginning 5 weeks (prepatent) or 16 weeks (patent) after infection. At comparable intervals after drug administration, the animals were reinoculated with infective larvae and the blood eosinophil response was measured over a 5 week period. The response in the animals treated during the prepatent period was higher than the untreated infected controls. Treatment during the patent period had no demonstrable effect. Jirds made artificially microfilaremic by intravenous inoculation of viable filaria before and after the standard infecting dose had a low eosinophil response to infective larvae. A primary experience of jirds with the microfilariae of B. pahangi evokes an eosinophil response. Subsequent inoculation of larvae did not produce a comparable response.\r"

  ".W": "Interactions of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus are compared with mesenterons of 2 genetically selected susceptible (WS) and refractory (WR) lines of Culex tarsalis. Both WS and WR females had similar susceptibility when parenterally inoculated with virus, thus it was initially thought that resistance in WR Cx. tarsalis was associated with a mesenteronal infection barrier. Present data on viral growth in mesenterons dissected from females fed on virus-soaked pledgets suggest that virus infected and multiplied in some WR mesenterons, but to significantly lower titers than in WS mesenterons. The proportion of WR females with infected mesenterons varied depending on the time after feeding, incubation temperature, and whether mesenterons were incubated with WEE viral antibody before viral assay. The percentage of WR mesenterons infected did not increase significantly when diethylaminoethyl dextran was added to the infectious bloodmeal, the pH of the infectious bloodmeal was altered, or virus was introduced by intrathoracic inoculation into the hemocoel. It was concluded that the low titers of virus detected in both WR mesenterons and whole mosquitoes were influenced by the genetic ability of WR Cx. tarsalis to modulate WEE viral titers to low or undetectable levels after peroral or parenteral infection. These findings make it difficult to determine what proportion of the WR mesenterons are resistant to infection with WEE virus. WS and WR Cx. tarsalis were equally susceptible to peroral infection with the flavivirus St. Louis encephalitis and the bunyavirus Turlock.\r"

Twenty women admitted for elective Caesarean section under general anaesthesia received a single 80-mg oral omeprazole dose at 2000 hours on the evening before surgery. Intragastric pH and volume were measured immediately after induction of anaesthesia and on completion of surgery. Eighty-five percent of pH measurements at induction and extubation and 80% and 95% of volume measurements at induction and extubation respectively met the defined success criteria (pH greater than or equal to 2.5, volume less than 25 ml). Omeprazole treatment was well tolerated by the women and Apgar scores and subsequent progress of the babies were acceptable. These results indicate that gastric acidity and volume were acceptable in the majority of women after omeprazole treatment, but the interval from drug administration to induction of anaesthesia may have been too long in some cases and resulted in unacceptably low pHs.\r"

The closed-end catheters were easier and less painful to place, but gave a higher incidence of bloody taps. The open-end catheters caused sensory blockade to be more frequently unilateral and more frequently missed sensory segments. This resulted in a significantly higher number of open-end catheters that required replacement (p less than 0.001). Open-end catheters despite their theoretical advantages in the detection of intravenous and subarachnoid placement caused an unacceptably high incidence of unsatisfactory sensory blockade.\r"

Fatal doses of lidocaine, bupivacaine, and ropivacaine were established in sheep treated with successive daily dose increments of each drug. The mean fatal dose of lidocaine (+/- SD) was 1450 +/- 191 mg (30.8 +/- 5.8 mg/kg), that of bupivacaine was 156 +/- 31 mg (3.7 +/- 1.1 mg/kg), and that of ropivacaine was 325 +/- 108 mg (7.3 +/- 1.0 mg/kg); thus the ratio of fatal doses was approximately 9:1:2. In four out of four lidocaine-treated animals, respiratory depression with bradycardia and hypotension without arrhythmias were the causes of death. Three out of four bupivacaine-treated animals died after the sudden onset of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation without hypoxia or acidosis; the fourth died in a similar manner to the lidocaine-treated animals. Three out of five animals given ropivacaine died in a manner resembling the fatal effects of lidocaine-treated animals, but unlike the lidocaine-treated animals, in all three sheep there were also periods of ventricular arrhythmias. The remaining two ropivacaine-treated sheep died as a result of the sudden onset of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. The mean percentages of the fatal dose found in the myocardium was 2.8 +/- 0.7 for lidocaine-treated animals, 3.3 +/- 0.9 for bupivacaine-treated animals, and 2.2 +/- 1.4 for ropivacaine-treated animals; the corresponding percentages in whole brain were, respectively, 0.71 +/- 0.01, 0.71 +/- 0.21, and 0.89 +/- 0.27.\r"

The mean convulsive doses and arterial blood concentrations were approximately 110 mg and 40 mg/L, respectively, for lidocaine HCl, 45 mg and 14 mg/L for bupivacaine HCl, and 60 mg and 20 mg/L for ropivacaine HCl. After subconvulsive doses of each agent, there were minimal cardiovascular effects. After convulsive doses, there were marked increases in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, and myocardial contractility. Ventricular fibrillation caused death in two sheep after bupivacaine (80 mg) and in two sheep after ropivacaine (90 and 120 mg) administration. With sublethal doses, the hemodynamic responses to these agents were qualitatively and quantitatively similar when compared with their local anesthetic potencies.\r"

  ".W": "The ventilatory and hemodynamic responses to hypoxia, hyperoxia, and hypercapnia before and during sufentanil infusion were studied in 16 chronically tracheostomized dogs anesthetized with two concentrations, 1 and 0.5 minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane. Sufentanil was infused at a rate to obtain a constant end-tidal carbon dioxide (PETCO2) of approximately 50 mm Hg for each isoflurane level. Before the sufentanil infusion, the PETCO2 was increased to 50 mm Hg by adding CO2 to the inspired gas, to allow comparisons at isocapnic conditions. Sufentanil caused only minor hemodynamic changes but significantly reduced ventilation during both levels of isoflurane. The ventilatory response to hypercapnia decreased substantially, but there were no significant alterations in the ventilatory response to hypoxia. After sufentanil infusion, hyperoxia caused a larger decrease in minute ventilation and caused apnea in four dogs. These results suggest that administering sufentanil during isoflurane anesthesia causes a reduction in the contribution of the central chemoreflexes to ventilatory drive and, consequently, a relative increase in the contribution from the peripheral chemoreflexes.\r"

On the first study day, 40 mg of unlabeled propranolol and 200 microCi of [3H]propranolol were injected into the portal and femoral veins respectively. Arterial blood samples were taken for 4 hr for measurement of plasma concentrations of labeled and unlabeled propranolol by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and of [3H]propranolol by liquid scintillation counting of the HPLC eluant corresponding to each propranolol peak. Twenty-four hr later, spinal anesthesia was induced with tetracaine (mean dose 20.7 +/- 0.6 mg) with low sacral to midthoracic levels and the propranolol infusions and sampling were then repeated. Spinal anesthesia had no significant effect on either the intrinsic clearance of propranolol (2.01 +/- 0.75 L/min before and 1.9 +/- 0.7 L/min during spinal anesthesia), or on mean hepatic plasma flow (2.01 +/- 0.5 L/min before and 1.93 +/- 0.5 L/min during spinal anesthesia). The systemic clearance and elimination half-life of propranolol were also unchanged by spinal anesthesia (0.9 +/- 0.23 L/min on the first day, 0.7 +/- 0.1 L/min during spinal anesthesia; and 101 +/- 21 min on the first day, 115 +/- 16 min during spinal anesthesia, respectively). The volume of distribution (Vd) of propranolol was similarly unaffected by spinal anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Segmental myocardial contractility was measured with the end-systolic pressure-length relationship (Ees), and the effective arterial elastance (Ea) was quantified based on the Windkessel model. The addition of 30, 50, and 70% N2O did not change myocardial contractility or the effective arterial elastance. During the 30 and 70% N2O challenge, however, arterial capacitance decreased significantly from a mean (+/- SEM) 0.86 +/- 0.15 to 0.71 +/- 0.0.11 mL/mm Hg with 30% N2O (P less than 0.05) and from 0.90 +/- 0.09 to 0.71 +/- 0.07 mL/mm Hg (P less than 0.05) with 70% N2O. A dose-response relationship for the effect on the arterial capacitance could not be demonstrated. We concluded that in the presence of halothane, fentanyl, and pancuronium, N2O does not depress the normal myocardium or change left ventricular afterload. The decrease in arterial capacitance that occurred when 30 and 70% N2O were given was not sufficient to change the effective afterload and appears to be of no importance to normal left ventricular function.\r"

After tissue processing, radio-activity was found to have penetrated in superficial as well as in deeper layers (Rexed lamina V, VII, and X) of rat spinal cord within minutes after application. Silver grain density reached maximal values at 30 min in every region of cord studied. Radioactivity decreased rapidly between 30 min and 2 hr and then more slowly over the next 24 hr. In rats tested for responses to a thermal stimulus (tail flick test), intrathecal administration of morphine (5 and 15 micrograms) resulted in significant dose dependent analgesia that peaked at 30 min and lasted up to 5 hr (P less than 0.5). There was a close relationship between analgesia and spinal cord silver grain density during the first 4 hr of the study. It is postulated that the onset of spinal morphine analgesia depends on appearance of molecules at sites of action followed by the activation of anti-nociceptive mechanisms.\r"

Activity (sedation) and anxiety scores, vital signs (including systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures, heart and respiratory rates), and pulse oximetry determined oxygen saturation were measured before and at 10-min intervals after premedication until the patients were taken to the operating room. Gastric contents were aspirated via an orogastric tube and analyzed for volume and pH after induction of anesthesia. Quality of induction and recovery were evaluated using scoring schedules; recovery times were measured and side effects recorded. OTFC was readily accepted and provided levels of sedation and anxiolysis significantly greater after 10 min than after no premedication or the placebo lollipop. Arterial blood pressures, heart rate, and oxygen saturations were not different among the three groups. In patients given OTFC, respiratory rates were significantly lower after 10 min than they were in patients having no premedication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 51 patients, the most rostral levels of sensory denervation to light touch, pinprick, and temperature discrimination were measured. There was no statistically significant difference in the height of sensory blockade in the 29 patients given bupivacaine and in the 22 patients given equipotent doses of tetracaine. The widths of the zones of differential blockade were also not statistically different between the two groups during onset, maintenance, and regression of anesthesia, except that the light touch-to-pinprick and light touch-to-temperature zones of differential blockade were greater with bupivacaine than with tetracaine 30 min after subarachnoid injection. The width of the zones of differential blockade also remained unchanged within each group during onset, maintenance, and regression of anesthesia. Changes in, and absolute levels of, blood pressure and heart rate were similar with both bupivacaine and tetracaine throughout. We conclude that zones of differential sensory blockade are essentially the same with tetracaine and bupivacaine, that the widths of the zones of differential sensory blockade remain constant during onset, maintenance, and offset of spinal anesthesia, and that bupivacaine and tetracaine are associated with similar changes in heart rate and blood pressure during spinal anesthesia.\r"

The CMG and UPP were examined for each of the two drugs in all dogs (four experiments per animal). The measurements were performed before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after IT injection of either 1.5 micrograms/kg fentanyl or 2 micrograms/kg buprenorphine. Fifteen minutes after IT injection of fentanyl, reduction in bladder tone was already noted, followed by decreases in mean peak vesical pressure of 48.3% +/- 6.0 (SE) (P less than 0.05) and mean peak urethral pressure of 38% +/- 3.0 (P less than 0.05) between 30 and 60 min after injection. These decreases, occurring in each experiment, gradually lessened at 90 and 120 min. The effects of IT buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist, on bladder and urethral dynamics were inconsistent and non-significant in all studies. Disturbances of micturition observed clinically after spinal opioid administration may be related to the decrease in intravesical pressure and the resulting highly compliant bladder. Relaxation of the urethral musculature seen 15 min after IT fentanyl may prevent overdistension of the bladder and its associated complications.\r"

To determine if epidural anesthesia also has a protein-sparing effect during major upper or mid-abdominal surgery, postoperative nitrogen balance and 3-methylhistidine urinary excretion (an index of skeletal muscle protein catabolism) were measured for 6 days in 28 patients who had undergone colon resection for cancer with general anesthesia (N2O-O2-1% enflurane) either supplemented with low dose fentanyl plus intermittent systemic pentazocine for postoperative pain (n = 13), or the same general anesthetic plus epidural injection of either etidocaine 1% intraoperatively and bupivacaine 0.25% postoperatively (n = 8) or meperidine (n = 7) for 48 hr after skin incision. The cumulative 6-day nitrogen balance and the cumulative 3-methylhistidine urinary excretion were significantly less after epidural injection of etidocaine intraoperatively and bupivacaine postoperatively than in the two other groups. There was a significant correlation between the daily urinary excretion of 3-methylhistidine and the daily nitrogen balance in the three groups. This study suggests that in colon surgery, epidural analgesia with local anesthetics in the postoperative period improves nitrogen balance and this effect takes place partly in the muscle.\r"

One hundred and five patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery were randomly assigned to one of three groups to compare the cardiovascular and metabolic responses associated with (1) thoracic epidural anesthesia plus light general anesthesia (group TEA); (2) general anesthesia with halothane (group H); and (3) neuroleptanalgesia (group NLA). Values of cardiac index (CI) and QO2 were less intraoperatively in the TEA group than in the H or NLA groups, while VO2 values were similar. VO2 during recovery was greater in both the TEA and NLA groups than in the H group. Consequently the oxygen supply-demand ratio (QO2/VO2) was less in the TEA group throughout the perioperative period and about 30% below baseline values during early recovery. At comparable VO2, CI and mixed venous O2 saturation were always less in the TEA group than in the NLA group. Heart rate was slowest intraoperatively during TEA, and stroke work was less with TEA than with NLA. As cardiac filling pressure and systemic vascular resistance did not differ among the three groups, reduced adaptation of CI to tissue O2 needs during TEA was attributed to negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of the sympathetic blockade. We conclude that in patients undergoing abdominal aortic surgery, TEA has no apparent advantage over general anesthesia.\r"

For example, the respective brain/blood partition coefficients were 1.29 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- SD); 1.57 +/- 0.10; 1.70 +/- 0.09; and 1.94 +/- 0.17. This indicates that induction of and recovery from anesthesia with I-653 should be more rapid than with the other agents. The finding of a lower tissue/blood partition coefficient for I-653 parallels the previous finding of a lower blood/gas partition coefficient.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of isoflurane-induced hypotension on reduction of blood loss, improvement of surgical field, and postoperative edema was investigated in 52 patients undergoing combined maxillary and mandibular osteotomies. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, N2O, O2, and isoflurane. Deliberate hypotension was induced by increasing isoflurane inspired concentration. Blood loss in the hypotensive group (MAP 55-65 mm Hg) was significantly less than that in the control group (MAP 75-85 mm Hg); 454.0 +/- 211.3 mL versus 755.3 +/- 334.6 mL (P less than 0.001). Fewer patients had to be transfused in the hypotensive group, 12.0% versus 44.4% (P less than 0.02). The surgical field was significantly improved by the hypotensive technique, but operative time was not shortened. Subjective and objective measurements of postoperative edema failed to show any effect of deliberate hypotension. Our data suggest that isoflurane-induced hypotension effectively reduces blood loss and the number of transfusions in orthognathic surgery.\r"

All children were given phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP) orally 2-3 h before the scheduled time of surgery as a marker dye to assess gastric emptying. Immediately after receiving PSP they were given: group A--liquids, up to 5 ml/kg + placebo (glucose water 0.2 ml/kg); group B--liquids, up to 5 ml/kg + ranitidine 2 mg/kg in glucose water 0.2 ml/kg; group C--placebo only; group D--ranitidine only. Gastric contents were aspirated after induction of anesthesia. Mean volume (range) in ml/kg of aspirated gastric fluid in each group was: group A--0.34 (0-1.0); group B--0.17 (0.07); group C--0.25 (0-1.1); group D--0.16 (0-0.6). The pH mean (range) value was: group A--1.83 (0.9-3.6); group B--4.76 (2.0-7.7); group C--2.10 (1.2-4.1); group D--3.97 (1.3-7.3). PSP could not be detected in the gastric samples from children in whom the ingestion-sampling interval was more than 2.25 h. In comparison with prolonged starvation, administration of oral liquids without ranitidine 2-3 h preoperatively did not produce a significant increase in mean volume of gastric aspirate, and there was no increase in the number of patients with gastric aspirate greater than 0.4 ml/kg. Administration of ranitidine with or without fluids resulted in a decrease in both volume and acidity of gastric contents.\r"

Blood samples from two of the patients demonstrated activation of complement and of the kinin system, whereas control patients did not demonstrate increased levels of activation products from these cascade systems. Recognition of this syndrome is important to patient survival, which appears to depend on rapid replacement of the graft.\r"

Twenty-seven ASA physical status 1 or 2 patients were studied who weighed between 5 and 30 kg, underwent superficial operations, were anesthetized with halothane and 70% N2O, and whose lungs were ventilated via a Rees modification of an Ayre's t-piece. The children were randomly assigned to receive active airway humidification and warming using an MR450 Servo airway heater and humidifier set at 37 degrees C (n = 10), passive airway humidification using the Humid-Vent 1 heat and moisture exchanger placed between the Ayre's t-piece and the endotracheal tube (n = 8), or no airway humidification and heating (control, n = 9). Distal tracheal and tympanic membrane temperatures and airway humidity were recorded during the first 90 min of surgery. Rectal temperature was measured during the postanesthetic recovery period. Relative humidity of inspired respiratory gases was approximately 30% in the control group and approximately 90% in the group given active airway humidification. Initial inspired humidity in the passive humidification group (50%) increased to approximately 80%, a level not significantly different from that in the active group after 80 min of anesthesia. Central body temperature increased 0.25 degrees C during active active airway humidification and heating, whereas temperature decreased 0.25 degrees C during passive humidification and 0.75 degrees C without airway humidification. Distal tracheal temperature was significantly higher in the groups given passive and active humidification than in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89372296\r", 
  ".W": "The hypothesis that increased intraoperative blood lactate depends both on intraoperative glucose supply and inadequate tissue oxygenation occurring during surgery was tested in anesthetized patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic surgery. Twenty surgical patients received either Ringer's solution or 5% glucose solution for intraoperative volume loading. Arterial blood lactate, arterial glucose, hemodynamic variables, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were determined preoperatively and intraoperatively. There were no significant changes in hemodynamic values, glucagon, norepinephrine, and epinephrine compared with control values in both groups. Oxygen consumption decreased only during aortic clamping. Cortisol and lactate increased significantly 10 min after aortic clamping until the end in both groups. Glucose 5% solution infusion resulted in significantly greater blood lactate accumulation and significantly greater blood glucose and insulin levels, whereas there were no changes in the patients receiving Ringer's solution. From control until aortic clamping, lactate and glucose were significantly correlated with each other in both groups; after aortic clamping until the end of the procedure, the correlation remained constant in patients in the Ringer's group, whereas no relationship could be demonstrated in those in the glucose group. The authors conclude that intraoperative glucose administration increases intraoperative blood lactate and that blood lactate accumulation depends both on glucose supply and tissue oxygen deficit. Furthermore, none of the hemodynamic metabolic and endocrine factors were reliable for assessing tissue perfusion and metabolic demands during surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Mivacurium chloride (BW B1090U) was administered to 72 patients during their elective surgery. The eight groups (nine subjects per cell) in the 2 x 2 x 2 study design differed in three factors: the size of the mivacurium bolus dose administered, whether or not this dose was followed by an infusion of mivacurium, and in the technique used for the maintenance of anesthesia. Four groups received a single bolus dose of mivacurium, 0.15 mg/kg, and the remaining four groups received mivacurium, 0.25 mg/kg, administered iv in 15 s. Precisely 2 min later, tracheal intubation was attempted. Conditions were judged to be good or excellent on most occasions, but intubation was not possible for two of the patients in the low-dose and one in the high-dose groups. Four groups, two at each bolus dose, received no additional mivacurium: there was a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of spontaneous recovery following the bolus dose. The other subdivision of groups was the use of either barbiturate-nitrous oxide-narcotic (balanced) anesthesia, or enflurane-nitrous oxide anesthesia; the anesthetic technique did not affect the pattern of spontaneous recovery from either bolus dose. Four groups, again two at each bolus dose, subsequently received an infusion of mivacurium, adjusted to depress the twitch response by approximately 95%. Infusion rates averaged 6.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 in the groups receiving balanced anesthesia and 4.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for those receiving enflurane anesthesia. Recovery following administration by infusion was slower than that observed following a bolus dose of mivacurium, 0.15 mg/kg but did not differ between the anesthetic groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Short trachea results from reduction in number of tracheal cartilage rings to 15 or fewer from normal mean of 17 rings in infants. In a review of radiologic and pathologic data, the thoracic vertebral level of tracheal bifurcation as seen in anteroposterior chest radiographs of infants with congenital malformations, cardiovascular anomalies, and skeletal dysplasias, was compared with numbers of tracheal cartilage rings demonstrated in postmortem specimens. Increased frequency of short trachea was seen in patients with DiGeorge anomaly (77%), skeletal dysplasias (55%), brevicollis (57%), diaplacental rubella (40%), and patients with congenital heart disease who did not have DiGeorge anomaly (36%, with range 25-83% for different types, the highest, 83%, being interrupted aortic arch). Preintubation high kilovoltage chest radiographs to establish the level of tracheal bifurcation in patients with increased risk of short trachea can be helpful in avoiding bronchial intubation and its complications. Postintubation chest films to assure the level of the endotracheal tube tip should be considered for such patients. Growth in length of the trachea with age is accomplished both by increase in size of tracheal cartilage rings and interring membranes, and by increase in ring number.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty attempted central venous cannulations via the antecubital route were studied with fluoroscopy to determine catheter tip location. Only \"catheter through needle\" devices were employed. Successful central placement occurred on the first attempt in 27 cases. The major impediment to central location of the catheter tip (ten cases) was the tendency of the catheter tip to lodge at the subclavian-internal jugular vein junction. The second most common cause of noncentral location was migration of the catheter tip into the internal jugular vein (nine cases). One catheter tip was located in the contralateral subclavian vein and one ended in the external jugular vein. All of these problems were avoided by two maneuvers: 1) turning the patient's head toward the side of cannulation and applying digital pressure to the ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa, and 2) withdrawing the catheter stylet and injecting 5-10 ml of physiologic saline solution while the catheter was advanced. The only cause of unsuccessful central placement in this study was inability to pass the catheter tip past the axillary venous plexus (two patients). It is concluded that the head-turn-supraclavicular fossa pressure maneuver in combination with the stylet withdrawal-saline injection maneuver can result in greater than a 90% rate of successful central venous catheter placement.\r"

Because mild hypothermia is common during general anesthesia, the authors sought to determine the relationship between the core temperature, adductor pollicis muscle temperature, and the twitch response of the adductor pollicis muscle, during isoflurane anesthesia in 15 patients undergoing elective surgery in which muscle relaxants were not required. Five patients were allowed to cool spontaneously, five were cooled actively, and normothermia was maintained actively in the remaining five. In the normothermic patients (core greater than 36.5 degrees C, muscle greater than 35.7 degrees C), the twitch response of the muscle remained unchanged from control values. In the patients who were cooled passively or actively, a muscle temperature threshold was observed (35.2 degrees C), below which twitch response of the muscle diminished by 10-15%/degrees C decrease in muscle temperature. To ensure that the adductor pollicis muscle temperature remained above 35.2 degrees C, the core temperature had to be maintained above 36 degrees C. A significant linear relationship (P less than 0.05) was found between the adductor pollicis muscle temperature and twitch tension below the threshold for each individual patient in the cooled groups (correlation coefficient range, 0.80-0.99). Thus, there is a temperature-related decrease in adductor pollicis twitch response during isoflurane anesthesia, and the temperature of this muscle should be maintained above 35-35.5 degrees C during studies of neuromuscular transmission. This can be achieved by maintaining core temperature above 36 degrees C.\r"

Seventeen records (37%) had at least three automatic blood pressure determinations with values substantially in excess of the most extreme values recorded by hand. No handwritten record contained a diastolic pressure above 110 mmHg. Discrepancies between handwritten and automatic records may arise from one or more causes. Among these are readings captured automatically but not observed by the anesthesiologist, faulty reconstruction of handwritten records from memory, and bias in favor of less controversial values.\r"

Clinical recovery was evaluated from the ability to lift the head, sustain headlift for 5 or 10 s, protrude the tongue, open the eyes, and the presence of ptosis of the eyelids. In all patients the mechanical TOF ratio was recorded. In 17 patients TOF ratios based on measurements of the potential area and the amplitude of the major negative deflection of the compound EMG response were recorded as well. At each TOF ratio interval of 0.05 from a TOF ratio of 0.5-0.85, the number of patients being able to perform the individual tests was recorded. Further, the mechanical TOF ratio during recovery was compared with the EMG TOF ratios. Headlift could not be sustained for 5 s in any patient at a TOF ratio of 0.5, whether recorded mechanically or by EMG, and TOF ratio had to recover to 0.8 before all patients could sustain headlift for 5 s. All patients could open the eyes and protrude the tongue at a TOF ratio of 0.65, and ptosis remained present during the entire testing period. There was no statistically significant difference between the mechanical and the EMG methods with regard to the TOF ratios at which the tests could be performed. During recovery a linear relationship was found between mechanical TOF ratios and the square root of the EMG TOF ratios.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medial layers of the aorta from rabbits were mounted on photodiode tension transducers, stretched to 20 mg resting tension, and \"skinned\" with saponin. The skinned fiber preparations were then immersed in bathing solutions to study the effects of halothane (0.5-2%) on Ca2+ activation of the contractile proteins, and Ca2+ uptake and release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) using caffeine-induced tension transients. For comparison, isolated intact aortic rings were mounted on Blinks' dual tissue bath and attached to force transducers. The preparations were contracted with either 40 mM KCl, or norepinephrine (NE) followed by acetylcholine (ACh)- or sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-induced relaxation. At steady state contraction or relaxation, the effects of halothane (1-3%) were studied. The steady state tension during halothane was expressed as a percentage of the steady state tension before administration of halothane. In the isolated intact aortic rings, halothane (1-3%) produced biphasic effects on KCl-induced tension, i.e., an initially slight increase followed by decreases, independent of endothelium. Halothane markedly increased tension in the ACh- or SNP-relaxed state. The effects were dose-dependent. In the skinned aortic strips, halothane slightly decreased maximum Ca2+-activated tension development of the contractile proteins. Halothane decreased Ca2+ accumulation in the SR and increased Ca2+ release from the SR in a dose-dependent manner. The halothane-induced increases in Ca2+ release from the SR were blocked by ryanodine, an SR Ca2+ release channel blocker. It is concluded that halothane directly causes vascular contraction or relaxation, depending on the condition, and that halothane's effects on the SR may play a role.\r"

To determine clonidine's distribution and cardiorespiratory effects 300 micrograms clonidine was injected epidurally, intrathecally, and intravenously in six chronically prepared sheep, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and arterial plasma clonidine were measured. Dural transfer of epidurally administered clonidine was rapid and extensive: time to maximal concentration (Tmax) in CSF was 32 +/- 8 min, bioavailability in CSF was 14 +/- 4% of the administered dose, and maximal CSF concentrations following epidural administration (820 +/- 30 ng/ml) were three orders of magnitude greater than those following iv injection (0.71 +/- 0.06 ng/ml). Systemic absorption of epidurally administered clonidine occurred rapidly: Tmax in plasma was 34 +/- 6 min and plasma concentrations were similar to those following iv injection at all time points beyond 20 min. Elimination half-lives from plasma were similar for all three routes of administration (81-95 min). Clonidine's effect on blood pressure differed with route of administration. Blood pressure increased and heart rate decreased following iv injection when plasma clonidine concentrations were high (greater than 2 ng/ml). Clonidine, following all routes of administration, numerically decreased blood pressure, but this decrease was significant only following epidural (mean arterial pressure = 97 +/- 6 mmHg before, 86 +/- 6 mmHg after; P less than 0.05) and intrathecal (93 +/- 9 mmHg before, 79 +/- 10 mmHg after; P less than 0.05) injection.

Because opioids are used in clinical anesthesia, the effect of an opiate antagonist was evaluated on neurologic outcome in a rat model of spinal cord injury occurring during opioid anesthesia. One day prior to spinal cord injury, a catheter was inserted into the spinal subarachnoid space with the tip at T8. On the day of spinal cord injury a balloon tipped catheter was inserted in the epidural space with the tip at the thoracolumbar junction. Spinal cord injury was produced by balloon inflation during one of the following states: 1) group 1 (A/S), injury was produced in awake rats and saline was administered in the subarachnoid space immediately following injury; 2) group 2 (F/S), injury was produced during a fentanyl/nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthetic, and subarachnoid saline administered; and 3) group 3 (F/Nx), injury was produced during a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, and subarachnoid naloxone (1 mg/kg) was administered immediately following injury. Dose-response curves describing the relationship between the duration of balloon inflation and the percentage of animals with a persistent neurologic deficit were constructed and compared for differences by use of a group t test. The duration of balloon inflation required to produce a neurologic deficit was greater in both the F/S and F/Nx groups than in the A/S group (P less than 0.05). There was no difference between the F/S and F/Nx groups. In summary, in rats receiving a fentanyl/N2O anesthetic, neurologic outcome was improved compared with the awake state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There is evidence that both oxidatively and reductively formed intermediates may produce hepatotoxicity, although the exact etiology of the fulminant hepatic necrosis seen in humans is unproven. Obese patients receiving volatile anesthetics exhibit higher serum anesthetic metabolite concentrations than do normal-weight patients, and thus might be at greater risk of hepatotoxicity because of higher concentrations of reactive intermediates from halothane metabolism. To eliminate the variables inherent in human clinical studies leading to confounding interpretation of data, this study determined the contributions of oxidative and reductive pathways to halothane metabolism in an animal model of human hypertrophic obesity, the most common form of human obesity. Eight pairs of obese (high-fat diet) and normal-weight (standard chow), male Fischer 344 rats were anesthetized with halothane for 4 h at an inspired concentration of 0.78%. Serum and urinary concentrations of TFAA, Br-, and F-were measured. Thirty-six hours following halothane anesthesia, mean serum TFAA concentrations peaked at 7.3 +/- 1.1 mM in obese rats and 4.7 +/- 0.7 mM in nonobese rats. TFAA urinary excretions during the 180-h period postanesthesia were 519 +/- 69 and 336 +/- 22 mumol, respectively. Peak serum Br- concentrations were 9.1 +/- 1.0 and 6.9 +/- 0.6 mM for obese and nonobese rats, respectively, and Br-urinary excretions were 127 +/- 30 and 79 +/- 14 mumol, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats, anesthetized with halothane and nitrous oxide (N2O) in oxygen were randomly assigned to one of six groups. A normoxic control group which received 70% N2O in oxygen, a hypoxia group received no iv drug treatment (hypoxia-N2O), and four iv drug treatment groups (N2O was replaced by 70% nitrogen at the start of drug administration). The iv drug groups were treated as follows: hypoxia-etomidate low dose (1 mg.kg-1 iv followed by an infusion at 0.35 mg.kg-1.min-1); hypoxia-etomidate high dose (1 mg.kg-1 then 1.3 mg.kg-1.min-1); hypoxia-thiopental low dose (15 mg.kg-1, then 1.5 mg.kg-1.min-1); and hypoxia-thiopental high dose (15 mg.kg-1, then 5 mg.kg-1.min-1). After hypoxia or a corresponding period in the normoxic group, the brains were frozen in situ for later biochemical analysis. Blood was obtained prior to and at the end of hypoxia and analyzed for glucose. Brain metabolite concentrations on the side ipsilateral to the ligated carotid artery in the normoxia-N2O group were adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 2.76 +/- 0.1, phosphocreatione (PCr) 3.88 +/- 0.12, lactate 2.34 +/- 0.16, and glucose 3.56 +/- 0.28 (mumole.g-1 wet weight, mean +/- SE).

Once barium contracture force was established, muscle length was perturbed with small amplitude sinusoidal oscillations in the frequency range of 0.1-100 Hz. Nifedipine 1 microM was then added to the superfusate and dynamic stiffness was again measured. Additional barium was used to determine restoration of contracture force to and beyond control levels. Nifedipine produced a significant decrease in contracture force and high-frequency stiffness with no effect on the frequency (fmin) at which stiffness amplitude exhibited a minimum (P less than 0.005). Contracture force and stiffness could be restored by adding additional barium to the nifedipine-treated muscles. These results are similar to those reported by Shibata et al. using volatile anesthetics. Since nifedipine, which acts specifically at the sarcolemmal slow Ca2+ channel, affects contracture force and dynamic stiffness in this preparation in a manner similar to the volatile anesthetics, the authors suggest that the anesthetics studied by Shibata et al. may well exert a significant component of their negative inotropic activity via their action on the sarcolemmal slow Ca2+ channel.\r"

A mean of 0.38 epinephrine uses PPY was recorded, ranging from 0 to 2.82 doses PPY. Antihistamine uses averaged 0.69 PPY, ranging from 0 to 4.47 doses PPY. Antihistamines alone quelled reactions in 13 of 17 incidents involving Ana-Kits. Food-allergic patients were more likely to self-medicate, with 1.93 anti-allergic drug uses PPY, compared with 0.49 uses PPY for insect-allergic patients. Six of 22 insect-related epinephrine uses occurred during winter months. No statistically significant difference was noted between drug administration rates determined retrospectively and prospectively.\r"

  ".U": "89372369\r", 
  ".W": "Forty-one subjects with dermographia were studied for a 4-week period. Twenty subjects received ketotifen therapy, the other 21 received chlorpheniramine (H1) for 2 weeks, and then chlorpheniramine plus cimetidine (H1 + H2). Both groups had significant suppression of dermographia and skin wheals caused by dextromethorphan and histamine after 2 weeks. The inhibition by ketotifen of dermographia, histamine wheal, and the dextromethorphan wheal increased from week 2 to week 4. During the first 2 weeks, ketotifen's activity was comparable to chlorpheniramine. Ketotifen's activity increased during the second 2 study weeks to match the additional chlorpheniramine. These results suggest that ketotifen may have additional pharmacologic activities besides H1 antagonism, including possible inhibition of mast cell mediator release. As a consequence, cutaneous vascular hyperresponsiveness may decrease. Ketotifen appears promising as treatment for allergic skin disorders.\r"

The Quidel Allergen Screen and RAST were compared with the investigator's clinical assessment. The differences between QAS and RAST are not statistically significant. The QAS appears to be equal to the Phadebas RAST in sensitivity and specificity and thus offers a rapid, easily interpreted in vitro method for the detection of specific serum IgE.\r"

To date, this theory has been primarily supported by cases of occupational asthma, where prolonged symptoms have persisted following termination of exposure to the suspect allergen. This model is complicated by associated medicolegal implications, as well as by the generally long-term nature of the exposure, raising questions about the concurrent natural history of a given patient's illness. We report a case of non-occupational dog dander-induced asthma. Exposure was on an intermittent basis over a 15-month period, with the patient exhibiting a classic late phase response. Following discontinuation of exposure to dog dander, he continued to have symptoms, considerably in excess of his findings prior to dog dander exposure.\r"
