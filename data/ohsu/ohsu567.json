  ".U": "89227535\r", 
  ".W": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep disinhibition at the beginning of the night is one of the most frequently described biologic abnormalities in depression. As REM sleep in animals and humans seems to be facilitated by cholinergic neuronal activity, it has been postulated that REM sleep disinhibition in depression is a consequence of cholinergic neuronal overactivity. The current study with the newly available cholinergic agonist RS-86, which is orally active, has a half-life of six to eight hours, and exhibits only minor peripheral side effects, supports this assumption. The application of this compound before sleep led to a significantly faster induction of REM sleep at the beginning of the night in patients with major depressive disorders compared with healthy subjects and patients with other nondepressive psychiatric diseases, such as eating disorders. Whereas 14 of 16 depressed patients displayed sleep-onset REM periods after the administration of RS-86, this happened only in three of the 16 healthy controls and in one of the 20 patients with other diagnoses. The increased susceptibility of REM sleep to cholinergic stimulation was limited to the state of depression and was not observed in a group of remitted depressed patients.\r"

Moreover, there was a positive correlation between testosterone level and symptom severity in one of the laterality-defined subgroups and a negative correlation in the other. These data (1) provide new evidence of pathophysiological heterogeneity within a single general diagnostic group; (2) suggest that noninvasive, inexpensive, and easily administered dichotic listening tests may be able to define pathophysiologically meaningful subgroups; and (3) suggest a role for testosterone-related alterations in left hemisphere function in the pathogeneses of some affective disorders.\r"

We used data from two independent test-retest studies of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) and the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) to study the reliability of different time-related questions in these fully standardized diagnostic interviews. With two exceptions (anxiety disorders and alcohol-related questions), the test-retest reliability of most time-related questions in both interviews was judged to be satisfactorily high. Furthermore, the validity of time-related questions in the DIS (age at symptom onset, duration and frequency of illness episodes) was examined by comparing them with detailed \"consensus\" ratings done independently by different clinicians for 207 former psychiatric inpatients. A surprisingly high concordance was found for former psychotic patients except for those still severely disturbed at the follow-up investigation. Some severe restrictions were also found for nonpsychotic disorders with regard to judgment of the age at onset of phobias, panic attacks, and depression. For a more valid assessment of time-related symptom information, the use of specific memory aids is suggested.\r"

Using nonprofessional raters observing videotaped psychodynamic interviews of individuals with personality and affective disorders, the median intraclass interrater reliability (IR) of the defense scales was .36 but was .57 for group consensus ratings and .74 when related defenses were grouped into defense summary scales. When follow-up data on life vignettes were rated, the median interrater IR was .55 for those defenses occurring at least 5% of the time and .66 for the defense summary scales. In relation to follow-up data, so-called immature defenses (denial, projection, acting out, hypochondriasis, passive-aggression) were associated with higher levels of symptoms, poorer global functioning, and higher proportion of time impaired in psychosocial role functioning. Borderline defenses (splitting, projective identification) displayed a similar pattern. Among narcissistic and neurotic defenses, only devaluation was associated with poorer functioning, whereas intellectualization was associated with higher functioning. Finally, action and borderline defenses demonstrated significant correlations across methods and across time (video vs life vignettes), whereas obsessional, disavowal, and narcissistic defenses showed nonsignificant trends. Overall, these results support the model of a hierarchy of defenses.\r"

Twenty-nine cases were included in the study. In 17 only a genital mycoplasma was isolated, and in 12 cases a genital mycoplasma plus another bacterial pathogen were identified. Significant histologic findings included subpericardial and pleural hemorrhages, polymorphonuclear leukocytes in alveolar spaces, hemorrhage, and tubulocytic changes in the adrenal glands. The placentas revealed villous edema, deciduitis, and funicitis. The changes identified as significant suggest that mycoplasmas either cause hypoxia or promote histologic changes that mimick hypoxia.\r"

This report describes the unusual occurrence of pseudallescheriomas in the lungs, brain, and kidney. The morphological features of the fungomas varied between involved organs, with those in the lung showing well-defined layers of peripheral mycelial hypocellularity and hypercellularity consisting of anneloconidiophores and conidia. The fungomas in all organs were derived from necrotic host tissue, which resulted from nodular infarction due to fungal invasion and thrombosis of blood vessels. I believe that some previous cases of Pseudallescheria pulmonary fungomas that were ascribed to passive colonization of preformed lung cavitations may have been due to frankly invasive mycotic disease.\r"

Four of 14 cases had unique tubulovenous communications designated as tubular prolase and tubular transformation of vein. Such communications were most frequently seen at the architectural weak point where the thin-walled interlobar vein and their tributaries adjoin the renal pyramid. Simultaneously, Tamm-Horsfall protein used as a marker for the location of urine was detected in renal vein. These changes had no significant correlation to morphologic severity of myeloma kidney or clinical manifestations of renal failure. Thus, tubulovenous communication producing backflow of urine into the circulation is frequently observed among myeloma kidney as well as other tubulointerstitial nephritis, but its clinical significance is unclear.\r"

A trend was evident that patients with poor histologic grade, or those with Dukes' B and C tumors that were aneuploid fared worse than those with diploid cancers. However, measurements of survival were found to be more strongly and consistently related to such conventional prognostic parameters as tumor differentiation, Dukes' stage, and nodal status. Further, numbers of nodes with metastases (ie, 1 to 4 or 5+) more significantly discriminated Dukes' C cases than estimation of tumor ploidy. Although tumor ploidy may reflect some features of rectal cancers, their natural history and prognosis are explained better by assessment of conventional parameters used for these purposes.\r"

The child had received a unit of fresh frozen plasma 17 days prior to the determination of anti-HBs. The fresh frozen plasma donor was later found to be anti-HBs positive. The patient's anti-HBs was most likely passively acquired and therefore did not signify immunity to HBV. Various tests, including hepatitis B surface antigen group-specific and subtype determinants, ratio units of anti-HBs, and antibody class, have been used to determine whether or not anti-HBs will confer immunity. Although these tests have been thought to accurately predict immune status against infection with HBV, our case shows this may not be true, especially in patients who have been recently transfused. Anti-HBs testing may be predictive of immunity to HBV in the absence of a source of passively acquired anti-HBs.\r"

The patient had an acute clostridial hepatic abscess and multiple arteriovenous malformations (vascular ectasias) of the large and small bowel. The case suggests that these mucosal and submucosal vascular lesions, which usually cause hemorrhage, may also predispose to infection.\r"

Recent evidence has suggested that cholecystokinin (CCK) may play an important role in pancreatic disease. Investigations into the precise role of CCK in acute pancreatitis have been hampered by the lack of a specific CCK receptor antagonist. Using a newly described, highly potent and specific CCK receptor antagonist, L-364,718, the effect of CCK in two models of acute \"surgical\" pancreatitis was examined: (1) the bile salt ductal perfusion model in the rat and (2) a traumatic model in the guinea pig. At a suboptimal dose for pancreatic enzyme secretion (25 pmol/kg/h), CCK was found to potentiate the severity of the ensuing pancreatitis in both models. Continuous CCK receptor blockade with L-364,718 (25 nmol/kg/h) improved biochemical, morphologic, and survival indexes. This study suggests that physiologic levels of CCK play an important permissive role in the evolution of acute pancreatitis. The use of L-364,718 as an investigative probe or therapeutic tool for acute pancreatitis is worthy of further consideration.\r"

Proper patient selection requires hemodynamic stability, lack of generalized peritoneal irritation, and minimal blood transfusion needs. Computed tomography is now used to make the diagnosis, but the decision for laparotomy is based on clinical grounds. Forty-one (87%) of 47 patients selected for nonoperative management were treated successfully without laparotomy, while the remaining 6 patients underwent delayed operations for persistent splenic bleeding. Blood transfusion requirements were significantly less in the observed group than in the operative group for patients with isolated trauma and for patients with polytrauma. There were no known missed intra-abdominal injuries and no deaths with the nonoperative approach. Analysis of our results has confirmed that nonoperative management is a safe and effective alternative to immediate laparotomy in properly selected patients and it can result in splenic salvage without the need for an operation.\r"

When cyclosporine was given orally to heterotopically transplantation recipients, rejection was frequent, and graft-vs-host disease caused one death. After 30 days of intravenous cyclosporine followed by oral administration, no rejection occurred. Graft-vs-host disease was mild or absent, and there were some long-term survivors. Technical failures were relatively infrequent, but death from sepsis, eg, intra-abdominal abscess, occurred in 17% (5/30). Anastomoses of donor superior mesenteric vein to recipient portal vein offered no advantages over systemic venous drainage. Although the high cyclosporine levels used would be intolerable in humans, these results indicate that successful small-bowel transplantation can be achieved with adequate immunosuppression in a large animal.\r"

Between May 1, 1987, and July 31, 1988, 136 intraoperative angioscopies were performed during 112 peripheral bypass procedures, 15 thrombectomies, 2 embolectomies, and 7 miscellaneous revascularization procedures. Mean total irrigation fluid used in the peripheral bypasses was 398 mL (range, 0 to 1400 mL). Good visual quality was obtained in more than 80% of angioscopies and the failure rate was only 1.8%. On the basis of the findings in 71 of the 136 angioscopies, 78 clinical or surgical decisions were made. No complications were directly attributable to the insertion of the angioscope or use of the pump.\r"

Clinical features of the two groups differed only in the incidence of emergency operations (group 1 [6/18, 30%] vs group 2 [2/29, 8%]). Operative mortality in elective operations improved substantially in recent experience (group 1 [50%] vs group 2 [7.4%]). Significant reductions in total operative time, operative blood loss, and total aortic cross-clamping times paralleled and, in part, explained the improvement in overall surgical results seen in group 2 patients. Spinal cord injury occurred in 7.2% of the entire cohort. Nonfatal but major complications occurred in 25% of group 2 patients, with the most common being prolonged ventilatory assistance (12%). Current results with thoracoabdominal aneurysm repair both establish its safety and help to provide guidelines in selecting patients for elective repair.\r"

Eighteen patients were studied; 12 were followed up for 1 year, and 6 were followed up for 6 months. Four of 12 patients showed distinct improvement in the signs and symptoms of their disease, as assessed using the Columbia Rating Scale, at 1 year; none showed distinct deterioration. The 6 patients who were followed up for only 6 months were an average of 20 years older and generally more severely affected. None distinctly improved. Morbidity was considered to be minor and transient among the first 12 patients, while 4 of the last 6 patients experienced alteration in mental status lasting as long as several months. This problem has led us to conclude that older patients with preexisting cognitive impairment should not be included in future studies until the benefits are more clearly established. However, we believe that the distinct and persistent improvement seen in some of the younger patients warrants the initiation of a well-designed, randomized, and controlled trial of adrenal medullary autotransplantation for the purpose of confirming these results and assessing the effect of the procedure on the natural progression of Parkinson's disease.\r"

Unilateral basal ganglia hemorrhages or lacunar infarcts contralateral to the side of the fall were demonstrated by computed tomographic scans. The overall prognosis was favorable; eight of nine patients regained independent ambulation within 3 to 6 weeks. Our findings indicate that a distinct loss of postural balance arises contralaterally to unilateral pallidal-putaminal lesions.\r"

  ".W": "Muscles recovered from previous poliomyelitis may exhibit new weakness and wasting years after the original infection (postpolio muscular atrophy). Routine electrophysiological and morphological techniques may not differentiate weakening muscles from previously affected but stable muscles. We used quantitative motor unit potential analysis, single-fiber electromyography, and macroelectromyography (macro-EMG) to determine if these techniques could identify weakening muscles. We classified 18 previously affected muscles according to strength from 12 patients who had had poliomyelitis 18 to 50 years earlier. Muscles of normal strength had large-amplitude macro-EMG signals (1000 to 4110 microV; normal level, less than 390 microV). Muscles with new weakness and atrophy had smaller than expected macro-EMG amplitude (130 to 450 microV). Two muscles with weakness and atrophy unchanged since the original childhood infection had markedly increased macro-EMG amplitude (1710 and 1860 microV), suggesting the increased macro-EMG amplitude is due to stable reinnervation not strength. Mean motor unit potential duration and amplitude were lower in newly weakened muscles, but jitter, fiber density, and blocking were similar in all muscles regardless of strength. We conclude that low-amplitude macro-EMG signals may be useful in the identification of muscles weakened by postpolio muscular atrophy.\r"

During the follow-up examination, enzyme activity was assessed in fibroblasts to evaluate the uniformity of biochemical deficits. The biochemical findings demonstrated profound deficits of leukocyte alpha-mannosidase that remained remarkably stable over time and were very similar to levels of the same enzyme activity in fibroblasts. The cognitive findings showed that the patients manifested mild cognitive deficits. Cognitive deficits were generally uniform with no signs of progressive deterioration, except receptive language abilities. Suggestions are made for careful follow-up of auditory abilities in patients with mannosidosis.\r"

The potentials from stimulating nerves in the lower extremity were abnormal in two thirds of the children before the operation, whereas the potentials were generally normal from upper extremity nerves. Dorsal root rhizotomies caused an attenuation of nerve root entry volleys recorded over the lumbar cord but did not change SEPs recorded over the cortex. The exception to this was that the incidence of abnormal sural nerve SEPs decreased postoperatively. Lumbar cord functions measured by H-reflexes or by tendon jerks were depressed following the operation. These results indicate a significant degree of abnormality of somatosensory transmission from the lower extremity in a group of cerebral palsied children with severe spasticity. Moreover, selective sectioning of approximately 50% of the dorsal root fibers in the lumbosacral cord had little influence on cortical evoked potentials.\r"

Clinical manifestations included various combinations of focal signs and symptoms of subacute onset, similar to those produced by other space-occupying lesions of the brain stem. Evidence of systemic tuberculosis was found in six cases (55%). Computed tomography (CT) usually showed an isodense or hyperdense brain-stem mass with abnormal contrast enhancement; associated supratentorial granulomas were found in four cases, and hydrocephalus was found in two cases. Magnetic resonance imaging showed irregular brain-stem lesions with long T1 and short T2 relaxation times. Cerebrospinal fluid findings were also nonspecific, as smears for acid-fast bacilli were most often negative. An incorrect diagnosis of pontine glioma was made in one patient. In contrast, proper integration of data from CT and magnetic resonance imaging findings, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and x-ray films of the chest permitted an accurate diagnosis in ten cases. Prompt therapy with antituberculous drugs resulted in clinical improvement, documented by CT, in most patients. Brain-stem tuberculoma should be suspected in patients with space-occupying lesions of the brain stem who live in geographic areas where tuberculosis is endemic. Early diagnosis and prompt medical therapy are important in preventing mortality and reducing morbidity.\r"

Survival into adulthood, following renal dialysis and transplantation, has brought attention to the sequelae of long-standing cystinosis. We examined 14 patients with cystinosis, 12 of whom had undergone renal transplantation. Two patients had neurologic symptoms. One patient had progressive bradykinesia, dementia, and spasticity with computed tomographic scan evidence of cerebral atrophy and multifocal mineralization in bilateral internal capsules and periventricular white matter. One patient had behavioral and, to a lesser extent, cognitive disturbance and computed tomographic scan evidence of marked, progressive cerebral atrophy. Although the remaining patients had normal results of neurologic examinations, 11 had roentgenographic evidence of generalized cerebral atrophy; 2 of these had abnormal electroencephalograms, 1 had borderline-deficient intellectual function, and 2 had computed tomographic scan evidence of multifocal, intracerebral mineralization. The patients with nervous system abnormalities were not distinguished by patterns of medication use, demographic or laboratory features, or the relative severity of cystinosis. Although the neurologic involvement in these patients suggests that cystinosis may eventually involve the central nervous system, the differential diagnosis must include other complications from renal failure, dialysis, and immunosuppression.\r"

Spontaneous blinking may also facilitate sensory relay during sustained attention and, therefore, help prevent fading of a retinal image.\r"

Overall, 80% conducted serum osmometry (teaching, 100%; nonteaching, 82%; commercial, 57%). Freezing point depression was the most common method used by all laboratories; however, 33% of commercial laboratories and 11% of nonteaching laboratories used vapor pressure exclusively. One half of all laboratory supervisors did not identify why one method was preferred. Only 3% identified vapor pressure as a possible source of error in ingestions of volatile substances. Most laboratories estimated that they were aware of the patient diagnosis less than 50% of the time. Because vapor pressure osmometry is a potential source of false negative results when estimating serum concentrations of volatile substances, clinicians treating patients who have ingested ethanol, ethylene glycol, isopropanol, or methanol need to be aware of the methodology used in their reference laboratories.\r"

  ".W": "A technique to enhance difficult percutaneous radial artery cannulations using Doppler ultrasound is described. A series of 12 patients (nine hypotensive and three normotensive patients with poorly palpable or absent radial pulses) was assembled and the radial arteries were cannulated using standard intravenous catheters and a hand-held Doppler ultrasound device. Localization and cannulation of the arteries was facilitated by noting the characteristic sounds using the Doppler. Eleven of the 12 patients had successful cannulation of the radial artery. In one case the artery was localized but the catheter could not be advanced. No complications were encountered. It was concluded that the use of a common Doppler ultrasound on selected patients with poor peripheral pulses may facilitate percutaneous radial artery cannulations and minimize the number of catheter punctures before successful placement.\r"

  ".W": "Injured adults can usually be treated adequately with peripheral intravenous lines. However, in hypotensive patients, alternative techniques such as venous cutdown may be necessary. There are no adult studies that document the success rate or time required to complete this procedure in the emergent situation. During a 1-year period, 73 cutdowns were attempted on 56 patients. Sixty-two of these attempts resulted in venous cannulation with a free flow of fluid (84.9%). The average time required for placement was 4.9 minutes. First-year residents had a significantly lower success rate (70%) than emergency department staff (89%) or second- through fifth-year surgical residents (94%). One patient who lived developed a local cellulitis. There were no other complications. In the hands of an experienced operator, saphenous vein cutdown at the ankle is a reliable method of rapidly gaining venous access in the adult patient. There are few immediate or late complications if the catheter is removed within 24 hours.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that ipecac-induced emesis, even if instituted very early, removes only a mean of 28% to 45% of an ingested tracer. Because vomiting is an ancient reflex that occurs in mammals, reptiles, and other animals, we speculated that, in humans, maintaining a sitting rather than a horizontal posture during induced emesis might decrease the efficacy of gastric emptying. To test this hypothesis, 20 normal fasting adult subjects underwent induced emesis in the knee-chest position on one day and in the sitting position on another. Twenty-five 100-micrograms tablets of cyanocobalamin were ingested as a tracer along with 250 mL tap water. Ten minutes after tracer ingestion, 30 mL ipecac syrup and 640 mL tap water were swallowed. All resulting vomitus was homogenized, frozen, and later assayed for cobalt using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. There was no difference in mean tracer recovery with the two positions: knee-chest, 47.2% v sitting, 46.9% (paired t test, P greater than .95). Analysis of cobalt recovery for all 40 episodes of emesis revealed a mean of 51.2 +/- 23.7 (SD) micrograms out of 108.7 micrograms total cobalt ingested (95% Cl, 43.6 to 58.7 micrograms). This represented 47.1% of the administered tracer dose (95% Cl, 40.1% to 54.0%). Even if initiated only ten minutes after an ingestion, ipecac-induced emesis removes an average of less than half of an ingested tracer dose, with a high degree of intersubject variability. Horizontal patient positioning does not appear to improve the efficacy of this procedure.\r"

Before the law, 22.2% of the 379 injuries included abrasions, contusions, and lacerations to face, neck, and head. Following the law, this category constituted only 13.8% of 356 injuries, representing a reduction of 38% (P less than .05). Cost and injury severity scores (ISS) for 436 injured patients covered by the law were not significantly different between the pre- and post-seatbelt law periods. However, significant cost and severity differences were observed after the law between belted and nonbelted occupants: +2,569 compared with +662; ISS of 3.6 compared with 2.0 (P less than .05). Methodologic problems of an emergency department-based study and the need for E coding (external causes of injury) are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "alpha-Adrenergic drugs improve cerebral blood flow (CBF) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), in part, by reversing carotid artery collapse and by shunting blood from extracerebral to intracerebral vascular structures. Adrenergic drugs with beta 2-agonist properties may cause peripheral vasodilation, and thus may be less beneficial in this setting. The purpose of this study was to compare epinephrine (E), an alpha 1,2, beta 1,2-agonist, with norepinephrine (NE), an alpha 1,2, beta 1-agonist, on CBF during CPR. Twenty swine each weighing greater than 15 kg were instrumented for regional CBF measurements using tracer microspheres. Regional CBF was measured during normal sinus rhythm (NSR). Animals were then placed into ventricular fibrillation (VF). After ten minutes of VF, the animals received closed-chest CPR using a mechanical thumper. Regional CBF was measured during CPR. After three minutes of CPR, the animals were allocated to receive either E, 0.20 mg/kg (N = 5); NE, 0.08 mg/kg (N = 5); NE, 0.12 mg/kg (N = 5); or NE, 0.16 mg/kg (N = 5). Regional blood flows were again measured following drug administration. CBFs following drug administration were compared using an analysis of covariance adjusting for baseline differences during CPR. A Newman-Keuls multiple comparison was used to follow-up significant (P less than or equal to .05) differences. Statistical significance was considered at P less than or equal to .05. There was a clinically significant improvement in cerebral cortical flow with NE, 0.12 mg/kg, and NE, 0.16 mg/kg, compared with NE, 0.08 mg/kg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patient remained unconscious and unresponsive for three hours after admission. Despite an initial blood ethanol level of 98.78 mmol/L (455 mg/dL), recovery was complete without sequelae. Treatment consisted of prompt gastric decontamination and maintenance of adequate hydration and euglycemia. Elimination of ethanol was rapid in this child and appeared to follow first-order kinetics instead of the zero-order kinetics usually observed. To our knowledge, this is the highest initial blood ethanol level reported in a child with survival. Additionally, no significant metabolic or cardiorespiratory derangement occurred. Ethanol toxicity, elimination kinetics, and treatment are discussed.\r"

Because germinal plate hemorrhage decreases with increasing gestational age, germinal plate vessel size and/or structure may be an important etiologic factor. Electron micrographs of the cortical and germinal plate blood vessels from 13 premature infants ranging in age from 19-37 weeks gestation were studied; vessel, lumena, and endothelial areas were measured using a digitizing tablet. In infants between 25-32 weeks gestation, the germinal plate vessel and lumenal areas were significantly greater than the areas of cortical vessel and lumena. This finding suggests that one of the factors involved in germinal plate hemorrhage is described by LaPlace's law which states that the larger the vessel diameter, the greater the pressure on the vessel wall.\r"

A close relationship could not be found between the number of rods and the severity of weakness in any form. Type 1 fiber atrophy and predominance or type 2B fiber deficiency was the usual finding in all forms. In the moderate congenital form, type 1 fiber atrophy and predominance became more apparent in patients with a protracted course, suggesting that the histochemical abnormalities are progressive. The abnormal fiber type distribution is assumed to be related to the pathogenetic mechanism of nemaline myopathy in all forms. Because acid phosphatase activity was increased in muscle fibers of patients with rapid progression, an autodegenerative process inducing lysosomal enzyme activation may be responsible for the acute clinical progression and muscle fiber loss in this disorder.\r"

The responders' frequency of testing in 6 major categories of mental status function was independent of their age, sex, board-certified/eligible status, type of practice, and years elapsed since completion of training. The results of the entire study group and comparisons among demographic subgroups demonstrated a progressive decline in testing frequency with increasing complexity of mental status function. Child neurologists' approach to the mental status examination was remarkably uniform across a wide range of demographic variables. Higher and related cortical functions are tested significantly less often in children with learning problems than are other more elementary categories of mental status function; therefore, the importance of the mental status examination in this context must be questioned. It is likely that the diagnosis ascribed to a child with learning problems is based on findings other than those provided by the mental status examination.\r"

  ".W": "Urinary excretion rates of antidiuretic hormone were determined by radioimmunoassay in children with bacterial (6) and viral (11) meningitis, and in children with other febrile illnesses (7). These values were compared to normal data obtained from 50 healthy, normally hydrated children ranging in age from 1 week to 9 years. Plasma sodium concentrations were measured in the sick children; urine osmolality and creatinine concentrations were measured in all children. Upon admission, all children with bacterial meningitis and 64% of those with viral meningitis had urinary antidiuretic hormone excretion rates greater than 2 S.D. above values obtained from age-matched controls. Fifty-seven percent of children with other febrile illnesses had similarly elevated antidiuretic hormone values; however, only in the bacterial and viral meningitis groups were antidiuretic hormone excretion rates inappropriate because they occurred when serum sodium concentrations were found to be normal or low normal (i.e., 136 +/- 2 mEq/L and 137 +/- 1 mEq/L, respectively). The average serum sodium in the group with other febrile illnesses was higher (146 +/- 5 mEq/L; p less than 0.05) and could represent an appropriate stimulus for antidiuretic hormone release. In spite of high levels of antidiuretic hormone, most viral meningitis patients did not concentrate their urine, probably because all except 2 were younger than 2 months of age. We conclude that viral meningitis, like bacterial meningitis, frequently is associated with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion; however, most children with viral meningitis may be protected from developing hyponatremia because of their inability to concentrate their urine.\r"

Using the parent form of the Child Behavior Checklist by Achenbach and Edelbrock, we identified behavioral and emotional difficulties in 78 males, 6-16 years of age, with Tourette syndrome. Symptoms most often identified included obsessive-compulsive behavior, aggressiveness, hyperactivity, immaturity, withdrawal, and somatic complaints. Abnormal checklist scores were most prevalent in adolescents with Tourette syndrome. Tic severity was not a statistically significant predictor of behavioral disturbance, although a suggestive relationship between tic severity and behavioral disturbance was observed in the 12- to 16-year-old group. Dividing Tourette syndrome patients into those with or without hyperactivity failed to identify whether hyperactivity had a major impact on abnormal behaviors. Our results illustrate the relative frequency of psychopathology in Tourette syndrome and emphasize the need for a comprehensive approach to this syndrome.\r"

Seven children (7%), 6 with afebrile and 1 with a febrile seizure, had CT abnormalities. Four patients (4%) required further diagnostic workup including angiography and/or surgery. Children with afebrile focal seizures were more likely to have an abnormality than those with afebrile generalized seizures without focal components (13% and 4.9%, respectively). This study demonstrated a lower percentage of overall CT abnormalities, yet a similar percentage of \"therapeutically important\" abnormalities, in neurologically normal children with new onset of seizures when compared to previous reports of children with chronic seizures. Although an abnormal CT was more likely to be associated with an abnormal electroencephalogram, a normal result did not eliminate the possibility of an abnormal CT.\r"

EEGs from HLHS infants demonstrated significantly decreased quiet sleep and increased indeterminate sleep, an abnormally discontinuous tracing in active and indeterminate sleep, and lack of response to stimulation. No significant differences were present in the amount of active sleep, sharp waves, focal slowing, or rhythmic theta activity. The distinctive abnormalities were unrelated to arterial blood gases or treatment with prostaglandin E at recording. Four HLHS infants had repeat recordings performed; there were serial increases in quiet sleep, decreases in indeterminate sleep, and improved continuity in all patients. Certain EEG abnormalities occur more frequently in infants with HLHS than in patients with other cardiac defects or noncardiac problems. These findings may result from the early onset of heart failure and abnormal cerebral perfusion due to hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and great arteries, conditions commonly associated with HLHS.\r"

In a continuation of a movement started around 1980 by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) to quantify and project supply and demand for physicians, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) have recently produced their latest studies on this subject. The HRSA conclusion, published in its 1988 report to the President and Congress on the status of health personnel in the United States, is that a surplus may come as early as 1990 and will probably worsen by the year 2000. The AMA study, also published in 1988, agrees with the HRSA and the GMENAC that supply will probably grow faster than demand, but it disclaims the notion of a surplus or shortage because that would imply judgments about the adequacy of current utilization rates by all segments of the population. The HRSA report cites a 1986 finding by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation that access to medical care deteriorated between 1982 and 1986 for minorities and lower-income groups. On the supply side, the HRSA's estimates are somewhat higher than the AMA's, mainly because the former assumes faster growth in foreign medical graduates. Both studies use a demand-based approach to projecting the number of physicians required, but there are considerable differences in the assumptions made about future utilization rates.\r"

  ".W": "Because practicing physicians are poorly prepared to resolve many ethical issues that arise in patient care, this article proposes that residencies include practical training in medical ethics. Training in medical ethics helps physicians recognize ethical issues in patient care and resolve those issues wisely. Furthermore, such training has its maximum impact during the professionally formative years of residency. The article specifies key ethical concepts residents should know, including knowing how to obtain informed consent, knowing what to do about incompetent patients, knowing when to withhold or disclose clinical information, and knowing how to use resources properly. The article also points out that the success of residency training in ethics depends on strong commitments from the department: endorsement by the chairman and the residency program director; recruitment of several dedicated faculty; support for adequate ethics training for these faculty; dedication of conferences, rounds, and consultations to teaching ethics; and allocation of sufficient funds.\r"

Respondents were also asked for their views of their units' and institutions' perceptions of the importances of the same four activities in the promotion process, as well as other related questions about promotion and tenure. The findings indicate that there is still a significant incongruence between the value structure of most family practice units and that of their institutions but that many family practice units are beginning to achieve parity of promotion and tenure with other departments in their institutions.\r"

The system is complicated, and entry depends on numerous variables. Facility in the English language is considered a prerequisite. Among opportunities, clinical training is probably most sought in the form of either residencies or clinical fellowships. Many major medical centers are eager to host earnest students and trainees from abroad. Yet such opportunities are limited, since most programs are unable to accept additional trainees once the first year of the program has been filled. Additional residency positions are not likely to be created and funded. In general, the larger academic medical centers tend to be the first to introduce new technologies and newer diagnostic and therapeutic modalities. Other settings may offer better, or at least equally good, environments for other kinds of post-M.D.-degree training. U.S. educational opportunities also exist in health policy and health systems education, nursing education, allied health and non-physician education, and research. All those seeking to study in the United States are urged to consult one of the several agencies that are knowledgeable about the opportunities and requirements for entering the programs offered.\r"

The Panamerican Federation of Associations of Medical Schools (PAFAMS) was founded for the purpose of addressing such problems in Latin American medical education. PAFAMS has promoted the exchange of ideas and experience among its member associations and schools by establishing a data base of information on medical education and developing mechanisms to disseminate such information. Other PAFAMS initiatives include a program to integrate professional health education and health care services within individual communities, and the linkage of medical education programs with health care institutions as a means of improving the quality of health care. A crucial next step in Latin America is the development of a leadership program to identify and nurture leaders in individual countries who will be instrumental in developing community-based health services by means of medical education oriented to such purpose. Thus, the key issue is to develop healthcare-oriented medical education.\r"

In most Asian countries, poverty is pervasive, and it is usually national in scope. This is often coupled with lack of government commitment to provide health facilities and health care for the entire population. Systems of medical education differ widely and are based mainly on those of the country of colonial domination; hence, the systems may reflect predominantly British, American, Japanese, or Dutch influence, among others. Although most medical schools in Asia have academic disciplines and admission standards similar to those of Western schools, there are sharp differences among countries in faculty salaries, faculty competence, academic standards, adequacy of staffing, and number of medical schools. Underlying conditions and influences that have contributed to the current status of medical education systems in Asia are discussed.\r"

Such education must be relevant to the realities of health problems in Africa. The priority of most African governments is training in traditional health care management and in fields related to community- and problem-based medicine. Presently, opportunities for such training exist in only seven centers throughout Africa. A model health care system, offered by most national governments, is described. This system, which includes district, provincial, and central levels of care, delivers over 80% of health services, and it is within such a system that nationals returning from postgraduate medical education abroad will function. Problems currently associated with these systems are the shortages of expertise in the areas of management, logistics, informatics, and resources mobilization, as well as the generally low literacy of the community. Africa also needs more teachers in the basic sciences, further development of biomedical research, courses in continuing education, particularly for field workers in isolated areas, short courses on investigative techniques, and goal-oriented research aimed at solving public health problems in the student's country.\r"

Reasons are cited in favor of a more active international role by the United States in medical education. Some of the contributions that the United States can make are summarized, and seven areas are identified in which the United States stands to make substantial gains through a more active role in international medical education. The authors conclude that it is the spirit of science, rather than diplomatic advantage, that should guide United States efforts in international medical education. A proposed role for the Association of American Medical Colleges as both a facilitator and a national policy advocate in the area of international medical education and health is outlined.\r"

For example, physicians should be socially responsible, have a broad viewpoint of the relationship of people to their environment, be trained in the proper mix of preventive and curative disciplines, and have practical skills as social scientists, leaders, and agents of change. While many innovative answers have been found concerning these and other complex educational issues, in developing countries, little change has occurred in the overall direction of medical education: doctors remain the last converts to the cause of primary health care, and time is running out for medical education reforms. In addition, in developing countries, the importance of the medical team leader is lessening as the importance of other members of the team, who are willing to work in the villages away from the great medical schools and hospital complexes, is growing. However, there are innovative programs that show how this unacceptable state of affairs can be changed. The author makes a plea for the planning and programs to make the necessary reforms.\r"

The response rate was good, especially for schools of medicine, with 125 (98%) of 127 schools providing information. The resulting directory, published in July 1988, lists 494 programs involving 84 countries: 319 in medicine, 44 in dentistry, 30 in pharmacy, and 101 in public health. Directors, titles and objectives of programs are listed, along with descriptions of areas of emphasis, types of affiliation, personnel involved, and sources of funding. International involvement of the schools was unevenly distributed: about 16% of the medical and public health schools and 6% of the dental and pharmacy schools accounted for half of the international programs in each of these four disciplines. Schools of public health had the largest mean number of international programs per school, followed by schools of medicine. The majority of programs emphasized education and research; lesser numbers were in administration and health care. The majority of programs were in developing countries, the People's Republic of China, and Mexico, together accounting for 19% of the programs listed. In addition to providing needed aggregate and individual information on programs in international health, the directory may serve as a basis for planning by students, scholars, and institutions.\r"

IMSP is described as an organization that will be able to provide tailored opportunities for high-quality education, centralized matching, planning, and evaluation; certificates for recognition of program completion; mechanisms to ensure the return of participants to their home countries; and a system to record the careers of IMSP graduates in their home countries. Proposed eligibility requirements for foreign medical graduates and selection criteria for U.S. institutions are discussed, along with obligations and requirements of program participants, program content, and the recognition for completion of IMSP programs.

Medical education should be tailored to deal with the diseases the physician is most apt to see--or at least apt to see in an academic medical center. Such logic does not prevail, however, in terms of either the numbers of physicians trained or the content of the medical curriculum. The Western model of a medical school curriculum has been adopted--but little adapted--for use by much of the Third World. Relevant subjects such as epidemiology, social sciences, and management are often either ineptly taught or omitted. A shift in attention from patient to community is recommended, accompanied by deliberate programs of education and health care to measure and improve the health of the community. Significant improvements in health in much of the world can be made only through community-based programs such as improved nutrition, education, sanitation, prevention of infectious diseases, and family planning. Two types of U.S. participation in international medical education are recommended: (1) specialty training of physicians from countries whose access to instrumentation and medical care support structures are similar to those in the United States, and (2) strengthening of institutions in developing countries in the areas of education, research, and practice appropriate to the particular needs of each of these countries.\r"

Restriction enzyme analysis of unintegrated viral DNA revealed the presence of conserved restriction enzyme cleavage sites in the long terminal repeat sequences. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 3' end of the viral DNA revealed a pattern similar to other HIV-1 isolates described. However, some of the common restriction sites present in other isolates were absent in HIV-1Z321. The extent of differences between HIV-1Z321 and recent isolates from North America and Zaire was 17.86-18.36% on the nucleotide sequence level and 26.5-33.2% difference in the predicted amino acid sequence in the envelope gene. Differences were also noted in 3'-orf (nef: according to HIV gene nomenclature; see Ref. 42) gene and U3 region of the long terminal repeat sequences of HIV-1Z321 and other isolates. Nucleotide sequence of a HIV-1 isolate, 12 years apart from the present isolates, will provide an important time calibration point for the evolutionary divergence of HIV isolates. Hybrid HIV was also generated by transfecting HIV-1Z321 and HIV-1HTLV-III viral DNAs into cells.\r"

When injected into goats a high-titer gp160 specific antibody response was elicited and group-specific neutralizing activity could be demonstrated in vitro. The immunogenicity of the protein was also studied in conjunction with a number of adjuvant formulations, and the highest potency in mice was obtained using a preparation with 0.2% Al(OH)3 and 0.25% deoxycholate.\r"

  ".U": "89228772\r", 
  ".W": "The ability of papaverine to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in H9 cell line and in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) culture was examined. HIV-infected H9 cells were exposed to different concentrations of papaverine for 20 days. Reverse transcriptase (RT) activity and the presence of p24 in the supernatant were determined to assess the level of viral replication in treated and control cultures. The most effective concentration of papaverine in the culture medium was 10 micrograms/ml, a dose that did not significantly affect cell proliferation. At this drug concentration the treatment resulted in no RT activity or p24 expression in the supernatant and no virus antigen detection at the cellular level as demonstrated by Western blot (WB) analysis. The activity of the drug occurred in a short period of time (60 hours) as shown by radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and affected the synthesis of the env precursor protein gp160. The drug was also effective in inhibiting HIV replication in PBMC cultures and influenced specific viral markers, namely, RT and p24. Evidence of the efficacy of papaverine treatment was enforced by the finding in the treated PBMC cultures, compared with the untreated ones, of a reduced percentage of cells forming syncitia and of the inhibition of the virus-induced decrease in the number of cells. When an equal number of virus-infected H9 cells exposed or unexposed to papaverine was analyzed for HIV-specific proteins, a marked decrease in the expression of the viral proteins was observed in the treated cultures. At the same time, one cellular protein of molecular weight 69,000 was not inhibited by papaverine. This may indicate that, at least for one protein, synthesis may not be affected by the drug. Our data suggest that papaverine merits attention as a possible nontoxic candidate for the treatment of HIV infection.\r"

For the earliest samples studied, no test distinguished those who would progress to AIDS from those who have not. The two groups diverged significantly about 1 year before AIDS diagnosis in the progressor group. Virus titers rose in progressors but remained relatively stable in nonprogressors. CD4 T cells and the CD4 T cell subset, 4B4, declined more rapidly in progressors than in nonprogressors. HIV antibody titers tended to decline in progressors, but the differences were significant only for antibody and to the pol-encoded proteins, p51/65, and the gag-encoded polyprotein, p55. Before the onset of clinical AIDS, progressors are distinguished from nonprogressors by markedly different rates of CD4 cell depletion and virus replication, but the elements that control these dynamics remain to be defined.\r"

Those admitted via the accident and emergency department at the same hospital reached the coronary care unit 1 h 32 min after being seen by the general practitioner whereas the patients admitted directly took only 43 minutes [corrected].

This reduced the cost of failure because angioplasty guiding systems were not committed to procedures that were unlikely to be successful. The hollow wire provides stability for the passage of the guide wire and can be used to measure distal pressure and inject contrast. To date it has been used in a total of 15 cases of occluded vessels; it failed to cross the lesion in four cases. Successful angioplasty followed in all patients in whom the lesion was crossed.\r"

In 30 of these the regurgitation was graded by cineangiography as mild, moderate, or severe and in four severe regurgitation was confirmed at operation. The half times of the aortoventricular pressure differences obtained with Doppler compared well with those obtained from pressure recordings at catheterisation. The relation between pressure half times and cineangiographic gradings of severity was not consistent. Similarly, a control group of patients without aortic regurgitation showed a wide range of the invasively recorded pressure half times which overlapped with those in patients with aortic regurgitation. This suggests that factors such as systemic vascular resistance, and aortic and left ventricular compliance can have an appreciable effect on the pressure half time. If these factors are not included the method will be of limited value, except in patients with pressure half times of less than 300 ms, when regurgitation invariably is severe. These results suggest that at present the method is of value only in recognising the patients with the most severe aortic regurgitation who need early operation.\r"

Thirty patients (group 2) had documented exercise or stress related supraventricular tachycardias--that is paroxysmal junctional tachycardia (24) or atrial arrhythmia (6). Programmed electrical stimulation was performed before and during the infusion of isoprenaline. No group 1 patient developed sustained supraventricular tachycardia during isoprenaline infusion. In 21 patients with paroxysmal junctional tachycardia and all the patients with atrial arrhythmias electrical stimulation during isoprenaline infusion produced the same tachycardia that had been seen during exercise testing and Holter monitoring. Changes in electrophysiological variables and the concentrations of serum potassium were not associated with the induction of supraventricular tachycardia by isoprenaline. Infusion of isoprenaline safely facilitated the induction of supraventricular tachycardia by programmed stimulation in patients who had spontaneously occurring catecholamine mediated symptoms.\r"

Four patients died during follow up, including both those with aortic vegetations; both mitral and tricuspid vegetations were found at necropsy in the other two. All remaining patients were alive at one year. The presence of tricuspid vegetations in intravenous drug abusers is associated with opacities on chest x ray, but carries a good short term prognosis. But these results suggest a poor outcome when left sided endocarditis is present in intravenous drug abusers.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of PUVA therapy on human Langerhans cell (LC) immunophenotype and function. Epidermal sheets were obtained from exposed, and control shielded, forearm skin at the end of a course of PUVA therapy, in patients receiving treatment routinely for a variety of dermatoses. PUVA therapy decreased the overall number of HLA-DR+CDIa+ LCs in epidermal sheets, and in epidermal cell (EC) suspensions examined using a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). PUVA therapy also reduced the overall EC allostimulatory capacity in the allogeneic epidermal cell-lymphocyte reaction (ELR), and the capacity of ECs to present tetanus toxoid to, and augment concanavalin A-mediated stimulation of, lymphocytes in the autologous ELR. Depressed allostimulation by ECs from PUVA-treated skin could not be restored by indomethacin (added to block prostaglandin synthesis). The reductions in LC numbers and EC allostimulatory capacity varied according to dose, and time since cessation, of PUVA therapy, and in individual patients were of comparable degree. By contrast, the allostimulatory capacity of residual LCs from PUVA-treated skin (purified using the FACS) did not differ from that of purified control LCs. PUVA-induced suppression of cutaneous immune responses, therefore, results at least in part from an overall impairment of EC antigen-presenting capacity. Residual HLA-DR+CDIa+ LCs in PUVA-treated skin which retain their alloantigen-presenting function may represent a subgroup of PUVA-resistant LCs; alternatively, these cells may be as yet unaffected because they have only recently migrated into the epidermis.\r"

In protein malnourished mice, the density of ADPase and Ia-positive Langerhans cells was significantly reduced, while morphometric assessment of their cross-sectional area showed a significant reduction of total cell area, cell body area and degree of arborization. Quantitative cytophotometric analysis revealed a reduction of ADPase ectoenzyme activity and decreased concentration of membrane Ia antigen. We postulate that these changes affect Langerhans cell functions, and in turn influence the immune mechanisms in the skin.\r"

However, the stroma immediately surrounding the implanted epithelium contained cells of human origin mixed with murine cells. Occasional murine cells (presumed inflammatory) were present in the human implanted epithelium. Assessment showed no correlation between the degree of differentiation of the implanted epithelium and the ratio of human/murine cells in the contiguous stroma. This technique provides a sensitive test for identifying human cells in xenografts and may be useful in assessing the role of stromal cells in the differentiation of a variety of carcinomas.\r"

The results have implications for the aetiology of these diseases. In addition, the distinction between the alpha-keratin patterns in certain of the conditions was sufficiently clear to allow the use of the technique as a non-invasive aid to diagnosis.\r"

The responses were measured after 48 h as increase in skinfold thickness with Harpenden callipers. Females showed a larger response at all challenge doses studied, and the slope of the log-dose response curve was significantly steeper in females. We conclude that there are significant differences in delayed type hypersensitivity between males and females.\r"

Clinically, with one exception, the warts were of the common type. HPV DNA was detected in all but one individual. HPV4 was found in one sample, HPV1 related virus in three, a virus hybridizing with both HPV27 and HPV2 in five (four individuals) and HPV7 in seven (six individuals). More than one type was detected in four individuals. HPV7 infection was related to the greater length of time spent in handling fish. These findings indicate that HPV7 is not, as was previously thought, found exclusively in those handling butcher meat and suggest that environmental conditions may be a factor in the clinical manifestation of HPV7 infection. The exact nature of a virus designated HPV2/27 and the significance of its presence in these fish handlers remains uncertain.\r"

Histologically, the specimens with Darier-like changes were significantly thicker and more dysplastic. The autoradiographic labelling index was not different for the lesions with these changes indicating similar cell kinetic characteristics. It is suggested that acantholytic separation of epidermal cells within a solar keratosis may signify that the lesion has a greater invasive potential than a solar keratosis not showing this change.\r"

After 20 weeks, treatment with tretinoin was stopped and diphencyprone was applied bilaterally for a further 10 weeks. Satisfactory regrowth of terminal hair on the scalp was achieved in only one patient. Eyebrow, eyelash and beard regrowth was achieved in one individual whilst in another, moderate, but not cosmetically satisfactory, scalp regrowth took place. In no patient did regrowth take place at tretinoin treated sites until after diphencyprone was substituted.\r"

  ".W": "Five patients with actinic prurigo were treated twice weekly with PUVA. One area on the back was shielded from UVA throughout the 15-week treatment period. Before PUVA, all patients had increased erythemal sensitivity to UVA and showed abnormal augmentation of UVB erythema by topical indomethacin. After PUVA, all patients were free of photosensitive symptoms and skin that had been exposed to UVA showed normal erythemal responses. By contrast, the areas of skin that had been protected from UVA showed erythemal responses that were unchanged from pre-PUVA values. Augmentation of UVB erythema by topical indomethacin persisted, both on UVA exposed and UVA protected skin. These results show that, although PUVA is an effective treatment in actinic prurigo, it does not alter the underlying mechanism  of photosensitivity. The protective effect is local and is due presumably to an increase in melanin pigmentation and epidermal thickness.\r"

Pregnancy outcomes considered were preterm delivery, low birthweight, low birthweight for gestational age, and perinatal death. Subsidiary analyses were also undertaken for Apgar scores, time to establish respiration, need for mechanical respiration and admission to intensive care. Before adjustment, the main consistent association was between the occupational status of the father and three measures of perinatal morbidity. Initial adjustment for the mother's socio-demographic background and weight/height ratio reduced the strength and statistical significance of the above associations, while further adjustment for lifestyle variations between the three status groups further reduced the above associations to marginal statistical significance. The findings suggest that observed class differences in pregnancy outcome are attributable to the mother's personal characteristics (height/weight, parity) and her lifestyle.\r"

C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of infection, was determined daily and used retrospectively to investigate the role of subclinical infection in preterm labour and to predict the efficacy of tocolysis and the development of a clinical perinatal infection. CRP was also determined in 66 women in uncomplicated labour at term (53 singleton and 13 twin pregnancies). The placenta was examined for histological evidence of infection in all patients who were delivered before 36 weeks (n = 21) and in all women in the control group (n = 66). Elevated CRP levels were more often found in patients who were refractory to tocolysis, suggesting an underlying infectious morbidity. Placental infection was found in 62% of the preterm delivery group and in 12% of the control group. There was an association between elevated CRP levels and histological evidence of placental infection. However, confounding factors such as urinary tract infections limit the usefulness of the CRP test. Because CRP cannot predict clinical perinatal infection accurately, its clinical relevance is very limited.\r"

All were less than 49 days from their last menstrual period. Thirty were treated with 200 mg of epostane every 8 h for 7 days and 24 were given 200 mg every 6 h for 7 days. This caused a sustained reduction in circulating progesterone concentrations, a smaller fall in 17 beta-oestradiol and no effect on serum cortisol. Abortion occurred in 21 women (70%) in the lower dosage group and in 20 women (87%) in the higher dosage group. Abortion was incomplete in 6 of these 41 women. A worsening of pregnancy nausea and vomiting was noted by 66% of women in the first group and 84% in the second. There was no delay in the resumption of normal menstruation following abortion.

  ".W": "Forty-six patients with early (Stage I and II) ovarian cancer referred as free of residual disease after primary surgery, selected for high-risk features, were treated with adjuvant single-agent alkylating therapy comprising either intravenous cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2) in 36 patients, or oral melphalan (0.2 mg/kg daily for 5 days) in eight. Cyclophosphamide was repeated every 3 weeks for 10 cycles and melphalan every 6 weeks for 12 cycles. With a median follow-up of 36+ months, 18 patients have relapsed. The actuarial 5-year relapse-free survival was 48% and the overall 5-year survival was 54%; median survival was 84 months. Pretreatment FIGO stage was the single most important predictor of relapse-free and overall survival duration. For patients with Stage IA and IB tumours the 5-year actuarial relapse-free survival was 89%; for patients with stage IC and II (all substages), the 5-year relapse-free survival was 24% (P = 0.001). For this latter group adjuvant single alkylating agent therapy was not adequate and alternative therapeutic regimens are required. The problem of suboptimal primary surgical staging is also addressed.\r"

There were no differences between the effects of the two treatments on the substances measured. Triglycerides did not change and there was a transient fall in very low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Low density lipoprotein cholesterol fell over the first 24 weeks but rose thereafter to pretreatment levels. There was a decrease in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol due to a transient fall in HDL2 cholesterol and a gradual decrease in HDL3 cholesterol. Consequently, the only change in lipid levels present after 48 weeks was a decrease in HDL3 cholesterol, the clinical significance of which is uncertain. There was, however, an increase in apoprotein B levels and decreases in apoprotein AI and AII levels. These alterations in apoprotein levels may be unfavourable, since apoprotein B levels have been positively correlated and apoprotein AI and AII levels negatively correlated with coronary heart disease.\r"

No such change occurs after a medical session spent examining patients with a fundus camera. In younger ophthalmologists the sensitivity recovers several hours after the treatment session ends, but in some persons there is a prolonged and possibly permanent elevation of threshold.\r"

The epithelial inflammatory infiltrate consisted of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and dendritic cells. In the underlying stroma the inflammatory infiltrate was organised as B lymphoid follicles, and there was also a diffuse infiltrate consisting of plasma cells and scattered B lymphoid cells, dendritic cells, T cells, macrophages, and polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Each type of cell has its special location in the tissue. Plasma cells were located on a subepithelial band and as a dense infiltrate round the acini of accessory lacrimal glands. IgA+ plasma cells outnumbered IgG+ cells, whereas IgM+ and IgE+ cells were few. Our data provide good evidence for the presence of both humoral and cell mediated immune responses and a possible role for autoimmune mechanisms in the conjunctival tissues of trachoma patients.\r"

No family member had any other ocular or cutaneous pigmentary changes with the exception of a hairy naevus on the thigh of one member. To our knowledge these are the first families reported with more than one member having isolated iris melanosis. This is also the first report of a possible relationship with ocular hypertension.

Rhodanese activity was normal in all patients, as were the blood cyanide levels in each of the 12 patients at the chronic stage of the disease.

  ".U": "89229363\r", 
  ".W": "Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a group of inherited disorders in which phagocytic cells fail to generate antimicrobial oxidants. The various forms of CGD can be classified in terms of the mode of inheritance (either X-linked or autosomal recessive), and whether the neutrophils display the absorbance spectrum of a unique b-type cytochrome important for the function of the respiratory burst oxidase. The finding that purified neutrophil cytochrome b is a heterodimer consisting of a 91kD glycosylated and a 22kD nonglycosylated polypeptide has raised the question of which subunits are absent (or defective) in the various types of CGD. To address this question we have studied the expression of the cytochrome b subunits in three genetically distinct forms of CGD: X-linked/cytochrome b-negative (X-), autosomal recessive/cytochrome b-negative (A-), and autosomal recessive/cytochrome b-positive (A+). Using polyclonal antibodies to each of the two subunits, we prepared Western blots of lysates of intact neutrophils from ten CGD patients. In the controls and three patients with A+ CGD, both cytochrome subunits were easily detected. Consistent with the previously reported finding in five X- patients, neither subunit could be identified in neutrophils from three additional X- patients. Both subunits were also undetectable in four patients with A- CGD (three females, one male). This latter group of patients most likely bears a normal 91kD gene, since the patients are genetically distinct from the 91kD-defective X- group. The mutation in A- CGD, therefore, probably involves the 22kD gene and the eventual expression of the 22kD subunit. Furthermore, the expression of the 91kD subunit in this group of patients appears to be prevented due to the 22kD mutation in a manner converse to that seen in the X- CGD patients. Based on these studies, we hypothesize that the stable of expression of either of the two cytochrome subunits is dependent upon the other.\r"

  ".W": "Since interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment has proven effective in hairy cell leukemia, its evaluation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a cytologically related disease, appeared reasonable. In our study, we have focused on previously untreated, early stage patients who are less than 60 years of age. All patients had less than 50,000 lymphocytes/microL and immunologic analysis revealed a CD20+, IgM+, IgD- phenotype for leukemic B cells in eight of nine patients. Recombinant interferon alpha 2b (IFN-alpha 2) at 5 x 10(6) U was given subcutaneously three times per week for 8 to 16 months. Consistent with earlier reports, side effects were minor with this low-dose protocol. All patients responded with a decrease of WBC count and lymphocyte count; in one patient, splenomegaly resolved such that he moved from Rai stage II to Rai stage I. On the average CD20+ B cells decreased from 14,312 to 3,995 cells/microL, indicating that no complete eradication of the leukemic cells was possible. A partial response, based on a greater than 50% reduction of CD20+ B cells was obtained in five of seven patients analyzed. The increased numbers of CD2+ T lymphocytes decreased in response to interferon treatment in six of seven patients. Furthermore, in a portion of the patients class II antigen expression was enhanced on LeuM3+ monocytes suggesting an in vivo activation of the monocytes by IFN-alpha 2. Immunoglobulin levels were substantially improved in that serum IgG increased by more than 3 g/L in three of seven patients. In one patient, lymphocyte counts increased in spite of continued therapy, whereas all others exhibited no increase of lymphocyte numbers while on therapy. Our study clearly demonstrates effects of IFN-alpha 2 treatment on both the leukemic cells and on the nonleukemic components of the immune system in peripheral blood. Whether IFN-alpha treatment will result in long-term beneficial effects in early stage CLL needs to be evaluated in a larger study.\r"

  ".W": "The CAMPATH-1 family of antibodies recognize an abundant glycoprotein expressed on virtually all human lymphocytes. All rat IgM and IgG antibodies of this specificity are lytic with human complement, but only IgG2b is active in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). We compared the ability of IgM, IgG2a, and IgG2b to deplete lymphocytes in vivo in two patients with prolymphocytic transformation of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The IgM (CAMPATH-1M) produced transient depletion of blood lymphocytes with consumption of complement but had no effect on solid masses or bone marrow. Similar transient depletion of blood lymphocytes was noted with the IgG2a (YTH34.5). In contrast, the IgG2b (CAMPATH-1G) produced long-lasting depletion of lymphocytes from blood and marrow and improvement in splenomegaly but no detectable changes in complement levels. These differences probably reflect the importance of Fc receptor binding for effective clearance of target cells in vivo. We treated 16 more patients with a variety of lymphoid malignancies and noted consistent effects on blood lymphocytes, marrow infiltration, and splenomegaly. At this dose level, there was comparatively little improvement in affected lymph nodes or extranodal masses. Nevertheless, the in vivo lympholytic ability of CAMPATH-1G is very potent as compared with other monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and may have applications in therapy of lymphoid malignancies and as an immunosuppressive agent.\r"

To determine if a lower interferon dose would induce a comparable antileukemic effect with less toxicity, a-2b IFN was administered at 2 x 10(5) U/m2 subcutaneously three times per week to 17 patients with progressive HCL. Thirteen patients had HCL in relapse after a previous response to alpha-2b IFN; four patients were previously untreated. The median duration of treatment was 9 months. Toxicity consisted only of transient, mild flu-like symptoms in two patients. Of the 13 previously IFN-treated patients, four had a minimal response, one had no response, and eight had progressive disease. Of four previously untreated patients, one had a partial response, two had a minimal response, and one had no response. In seven of eight patients whose disease progressed on low-dose IFN, the dose was escalated to 2 x 10(6) U/m2 three times per week, and all seven patients demonstrated hematologic response within 3 months to the dose escalation. We conclude that alpha-2b IFN at 2 x 10(5) U/m2 three times per week is relatively ineffective for the treatment of relapse after previous IFN therapy.\r"

  ".U": "89229372\r", 
  ".W": "Erythropoietin (Epo) response and binding was assessed in purified murine CFU-E and their descendants. Several features emerged. First, Epo on CFU-E is in rapid flux: Half-time for 125I-Epo internalization is approximately four to five minutes. Second, computer-aided Scatchard analyses indicate that greater than 70 high-affinity Epo-receptor sites on anemic animal CFU-E are sometimes already occupied by Epo acquired in vivo. When this is removed, 40% of greater than or equal to 370 sites per CFU-E belong to a high-affinity class (dissociation constant, kd: 73 pmol/L +/- 15 [SE]) and 60% belong to a low-affinity class (kd: 813 pmol/L +/- 246). Third, the few small colonies that develop from CFU-E in the absence of Epo are shown, by serial assay of 59Fe-heme biosynthesis, to stem from contaminating erythroblasts: a result consistent with our finding that, after eight-hour CFU-E culture, most erythroblasts no longer require appreciable Epo for growth. Thus, although the early need for Epo by CFU-E is nearly absolute, this need is not met by the often substantial Epo already on board. The inference is that repeated occupancy of the rapidly turning over Epo receptors is required. Fourth, Epo bound and/or internalized by CFU-E descendants decreases to 40% of zero-time levels after 14 hours in Epo-supplemented culture and disappears after 28 hours. Scatchard analyses indicate that 73 pmol/L kd receptor sites become undetectable at seven to eight hours, whereas 813 pmol/L kd sites are undiminished and only one-third less by 16 hours. This apparent disappearance of high-affinity sites and persistence of low-affinity sites suggests that (a) at least two gene products mediate Epo binding, eg, two different receptor polypeptides or one receptor and one cofactor which modulates affinity; (b) high-affinity sites mediate the growth function of Epo during the first eight hours of culture; and (c) lingering low-affinity receptors may mediate some unrecognized Epo function. Fifth, the efficiency with which 106- and 91-Kd CFU-E membrane polypeptides can be cross-linked to 125I-Epo is two- to threefold higher for cells labeled at high Epo concentrations than at low ones, which suggests that these polypeptides largely reflect low-affinity site reactions.\r"

Since the precursor of CTAP-III, platelet basic protein (PBP is 94 amino acids long, the 5'-translated region of the cDNA codes for a leader sequence 34 amino acids long. This leader sequence, like the sequence of mature CTAP-III, shows significant homology to the sequence of platelet factor 4 (PF4), the only other platelet specific alpha-granule protein cloned until now, from a human erythroleukemic (HEL) cell line-derived cDNA library. These leader sequences are probably critical for targeting such proteins to the alpha-granule. Northern blot hybridization with platelet and megakaryocyte mRNA shows a single species mRNA of approximately 0.8 kb, suggesting that the corresponding cDNA is full length. The cloning of platelet specific CTAP-III provides additional evidence for the platelet specificity of the cDNA library used.\r"

We have examined the role of the two chains of GPIIb in the maintenance of the GPIIb-IIIa heterodimer and Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide-binding function. Lysates of surface radioiodinated platelets were treated with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 18 hours at 4 degrees C. Reduction of the interchain disulfide in GPIIb was followed by immunoprecipitation with antipeptide antibodies specific for GPIIb(H) or GPIIb(L). In addition to the GPIIb-IIIa complex, a polypeptide of 120 Kd was precipitated by anti-GPIIb(H) and a polypeptide of 23 Kd was precipitated by anti-GPIIb(L) from reduced platelet lysates. To determine whether GPIIb(H) or GPIIb(L) remained complexed with GPIIIa, reduced platelet lysates were immunoprecipitated with AP3, a monoclonal anti-GPIIIa antibody, resulting in the coimmunoprecipitation of GPIIb(H) but not GPIIb(L). Conversely, the monoclonal anti-GPIIb(H) antibody PMI-1 immunoprecipitated GPIIIa with GPIIb(H). Thus GPIIb(H) maintains its association with GPIIIa. Furthermore, the GPIIb(H)-IIIa complex retains its reactivity with AP2, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) specific for the nondissociated GPIIb-IIIa complex. Affinity chromatography of reduced platelet lysates on immobilized KYGRGDS resulted in binding and specific elution of the GPIIb(H)-IIIa complex. These findings indicate that GPIIb(H) contains sufficient information for maintenance of a complex with GPIIIa and support of the binding of the heterodimer to RGD peptides.\r"

  ".U": "89229377\r", 
  ".W": "Human endothelial cells express a membrane glycoprotein alpha beta heterodimer similar to the human platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex (GPIIb-IIIa). This noncovalently associated complex is the vitronectin receptor (VNR). These two receptors belong to the cytoadhesin family and share the same beta subunit. They express different recognition specificities: platelet GPIIb-IIIa is a receptor for fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), whereas VNR is a receptor for vitronectin, and is possibly a receptor for fibrinogen and vWF. We analyzed the biosynthesis of the endothelial cell VNR. Our data show that VNR alpha is a two-chain protein which is biosynthesized as a single-chain precursor: the pro-VNR alpha. Pro-VNR alpha forms a complex with VNR beta, and this association occurs prior to the Golgi-mediated processing of the oligosaccharide side chains. Mature VNR beta is glycosylated by not fully processed oligosaccharide side chains because it remains endoglycosidase H (endo H) sensitive, even when the complex is expressed on the cell surface. This characteristic appears as a common feature for the members of the cytoadhesin family. These results indicate that although VNR and GPIIb-IIIa are biosynthesized in different cells, their expression is controlled by similar mechanisms, providing further support for the concept that the cytoadhesin family constitutes a distinct group of adhesion receptors.\r"

The plasmas from the two groups of subjects were incubated at 4 degrees C for 24 hours either in plastic or in glass tubes and the factor VII coagulant activity (VIIc) was assayed in the treated plasmas. The activation of factor VII under these conditions involves the generation of enzymes derived from factor XII (XIIa). The contact surface is rate-limiting for the activation of factor VII in the plasmas in both groups of subjects and can be supplemented by large multilamellar liposomal vesicles carrying the appropriate density of negative charge. The size of these vesicles is within the range of sizes of the large lipoprotein particles (chylomicrons, very low and intermediate-density lipoproteins). The relationship between the density of negative charge on the liposomal vesicles and VIIc was similar in the late pregnancy and the control plasmas incubated in plastic tubes. At a saturating density of negative charge the observed relative VIIc was similar in both sets of plasmas. The incubation of late pregnancy or control plasma in plastic tubes in the presence of sodium stearate caused VIIc to increase with increasing concentration of the added fatty acid. These results suggest that large lipoprotein particles carrying the appropriate free fatty acid at a sufficient density of negative charge could provide the contact surface that induces the generation of factor XIIa and the subsequent activation of factor VII. Moreover, plasmas from women in late pregnancy have a higher concentration of potential surface and a higher density of negative charge than the plasmas from nonpregnant women.\r"

To examine the interactions of PF-4 with the GAGs present on endothelial cell surfaces, we incubated 125I-PF-4 with cell suspensions derived from confluent monolayers of cultured bovine aortic endothelium. Binding of 125I-PF-4 was inhibited by a 100-fold excess of nonradioactive PF-4 and varied with duration and temperature of incubation. At 4 degrees C, binding reached equilibrium at 20 minutes with kd = 2.87 mumol/L and Bmax of 63.83 pmol/10(5) cells. Binding capacity was reduced 83.4% by brief incubation of endothelial cells with trypsin and 46.67% by incubation with Flavobacterium heparinase, but was unchanged by chondroitin-ABCase treatment. At 37 degrees C, PF-4 was internalized by confluent monolayer of bovine aortic endothelial cells primarily through low-affinity adsorptive endocytosis. The internalized PF-4 was degraded to amino acids and small peptides with 50% conversion after 18-hour incubation. These studies demonstrate that a secreted platelet protein can bind to and enter endothelial cells. Binding may explain the rapid clearance of released PF-4 from plasma and could have important local effects on endothelial structure and function.\r"

  ".W": "Factor IX Hilo is a variant factor IX molecule that has no detectable coagulant activity. The defect in factor IX Hilo arises from a point mutation in the gene such that in the protein Arg180 is converted to a Gln. Activation of factor IX Hilo by factor Xla was monitored using the fluorescent active site probe p-aminobenzamidine. Normal factor IX showed complete activation in one hour as determined by measuring the increase in fluorescence when p-aminobenzamidine bound to activated factor IX. Factor IX Hilo showed no increase in fluorescence even after 24 hours, indicating that the active site was not exposed. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that factor IX Hilo was cleaved to a light chain plus a larger peptide with a molecular weight equivalent to a heavy chain covalently linked to an activation peptide. Amino terminal amino acid sequencing of factor IX Hilo cleaved by factor Xla showed cleavage only at Arg145-Ala146, indicating that the Gln180-Val181 bond was not cleaved and that the active site was thus not exposed. The presence of factor IX Hilo in patient plasma was responsible for the patient having a very long ox brain prothrombin time characteristic of severe hemophilia Bm. Patient plasma had an ox brain prothrombin time of 100 seconds using a Thrombotest kit, significantly prolonged over the normal control value of 45 seconds. When factor IX Hilo was depleted from patient plasma using an immunoaffinity column, the ox brain prothrombin time decreased to 41 seconds. When factor IX Hilo was added back to depleted patient plasma, to normal plasma depleted of factor IX by the same affinity column, or to plasma from a CRM- hemophilia B patient, the ox brain prothrombin time was significantly prolonged. We conclude that the Arg180 to Gln mutation in factor IX Hilo results in a molecule that cannot be activated by factor Xla. Further, our data suggest that the mutation results in a molecule that interacts with components of the extrinsic pathway to give a prolonged ox brain prothrombin time.\r"

Mean life span of autologous platelets when platelet levels were declining was subnormal (2.4 and 0.8 days), and megakaryocytes were abundant in the bone marrow during thrombocytopenia. Megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity could not be detected in the serum of either patient at any point of their cycles. In each patient, total platelet-associated IgG varied inversely with platelet levels. Surface platelet-associated IgG was measured only in patient 2 and was significantly elevated (greater than 1,280 IgG molecules per platelet) at all stages of the cycle, even during thrombocytosis. However, the highest values were observed during thrombocytopenia. Platelet-bindable IgG in plasma declined to normal immediately before platelet levels began to rise. IgG eluted from the platelets of this patient reacted strongly with autologous and homologous platelets in contrast to a \"mock eluate\" prepared from platelets of a normal subject. The eluate from the patient's platelets reacted strongly with immobilized autologous and homologous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex and weakly with GPIb but not with isolated GPIIIa alone. In each patient the decline in platelet levels was significantly delayed following administration of intravenous gamma globulin 0.4 g/kg body weight for five days. These findings suggest that platelet-reactive autoantibodies are of pathogenic significance in some patients with cyclic thrombocytopenia.\r"

The mechanical constraints on platelet release were evaluated by measuring the resistance of guinea pig megakaryocytes to aspiration into micropipettes of similar diameter to the width of naturally forming proplatelet projections. Application of increasing negative pressure to the surface of the cells resulted in progressively longer extensions being drawn into the pipette until maximal extension lengths were reached. None of the passively aspirated cytoplasmic extensions fragmented off the cells even at the highest aspiration pressure under physiologic study conditions. The longest extensions were aspirated from megakaryocytes of the most advanced maturation stage, and a proportion of the mature cells yielded very long extensions over 50 mu and up to 150 mu in length. Surprisingly, the ease of aspiration did not correlate to cell size during any stage of maturation. The mechanical behavior of guinea pig megakaryocytes indicates a large availability of surface for extension in mature cells ideal for active proplatelet projection. The lack of mechanical fragility suggests that platelet release is a very late maturational event not yet initiated in the \"mature\" megakaryocytes available for study from marrow harvests.\r"

  ".W": "In this study we provide a characterization of the fibronectin (FN) binding to endothelial cells (EC), and we identify the FN binding site on these cells. 125I-FN binding to EC in suspension was time dependent and reached a plateau at 4 h. Cold FN inhibited this interaction in a concentration-dependent way, but vitronectin, fibrinogen, and IgG were poorly effective. About 80% of the total FN associated to EC at the equilibrium was specifically bound; of this, 60% was reversibly bound, while 20% appeared to be internalized. The FN binding was saturable and an apparent dissociation constant of about 0.23 x 10(-6) mol/L and a maximal number of binding sites of about 9.8 x 10(5) was estimated from binding isotherms. Autoradiography data showed that EC-associated 125I-FN was all in high mol wt form that did not enter the gel. We then characterize the FN receptor (FNR) in EC. An antiserum to the FNR isolated from human placenta inhibited FN binding to EC by 89%, and using the immunoblotting technique, it recognized two bands in the EC detergent extract of mol wt 125/160 Kd. This antiserum also recognized the EC membrane protein complex eluted from the FN affinity column by an arg-gly-asp (RGD) peptide. When this complex was included into liposomes, it poorly bound to FN. However, the binding was strikingly increased by addition of Mn in the buffer and was specific for FN in respect to other substrata. These data define the FN binding site in EC and indicate that it is functionally and structurally related to that isolated from human placenta.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed to determine the cross-reaction rate of the heparin-dependent antibody with Org 10172, a new low molecular weight heparinoid, and to investigate the effect of Org 10172 on platelet activation induced by the antibody. The plasmas of 17 patients with thrombocytopenia induced by standard heparin were shown, by platelet aggregation studies, to contain the heparin-dependent antibody. Of these 17 patient plasmas, only three cross-reacted with the heparinoid, producing a cross-reaction rate of 18%. When Org 10172 was added to a reaction mixture containing normal platelet-rich plasma, patient plasma, and standard heparin with non-cross-reacting plasmas, it inhibited platelet aggregation and thromboxane B2 production induced by the antibody, provided that the ratio of Org 10172 concentration (anti-Xa U/mL) to standard heparin concentration (IU/mL) exceeded 2.5 to 5.0. This inhibitory effect was observed only with platelet activation mediated by the antibody, but not by collagen (2 micrograms/mL) or ADP (5.0 mumol/L). Additionally, three of 17 patients with serious thrombosis, whose plasma showed no cross-reaction with the heparinoid, received Org 10172 treatment with a good response in each case. These findings suggest that Org 10172 may be a useful drug for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.\r"

The 125I-labeled antibody bound to 4 to 5 x 10(3) and 2.5 to 3 x 10(3) antigenic sites on K1K1 and K1K2 erythrocytes, respectively, with an affinity constant of 5 x 10(8) mol/L-1. Immunoprecipitation analysis showed that the K1 antigen is carried by a 93 Kd glycoprotein containing several cysteine residues, and approximately six N-glycosidically linked sugar chains but no detectable O-linked sugar. A minor labeled component of 32 Kd was also immunoprecipitated from K1K1 RBCs but the 93- and 32-Kd components were absent from K2K2 and Kell null erythrocytes. Under nonreducing conditions, three bands were detected at 200 (weak), 120, and 93 Kd. We suggest that the 120-Kd component represents a heterodimer of the 93- and 32-Kd proteins covalently linked by disulfide bridge(s). The 93-Kd glycoprotein is a transmembrane component which interacts with the membrane skeleton but is distinct from band 3 as shown by one-dimensional peptide mapping. The site density of K1 antigen blood group on Gerbich-negative RBCs (Ge:-2,-3) was threefold lower than on K1K1 erythrocytes, but the qualitative properties of the 93-Kd component were not modified.\r"

  ".U": "89229396\r", 
  ".W": "Leukemic blast cells are thought to arise from clonal expansion of a single transformed hematopoietic cell. This generality is supported by the rarity of convincing reports on acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) with two karyotypically independent clones. Relying on sequential cytogenetic analyses, we identified such clones in two children with relapsed AML. The first case, classified as M2 leukemia in the French-American-British (FAB) classification system, had a t(8;21) (q22;q22) at diagnosis; 16 months later, at relapse, the leukemic cells had uniform morphologic features similar to those observed at diagnosis, except that two independent clones were present: one with the original t(8;21) and the other with t(11;22)(q23;q13) [corrected]). The second case was initially classified as FAB M1 leukemia with a t(8;21) (q22;q22). At relapse, 16 months later, the blast cells appeared morphologically uniform and similar to the diagnostic specimen; however, in addition to the original t(8;21) clone, there was a t(1;11) (p32;q23) [corrected]. These findings suggest that separate leukemogenic events affecting different progenitor cells can occur in rare cases of AML. The presence of two karyotypically independent clones could also be explained by multistep leukemogenesis; that is, more than one cell from a common pool of preleukemic cells could be affected by the transforming event, resulting in two independent clones. Alternatively, in light of recent reports of therapy-related leukemias with an 11q23 translocation, the new independent clone in these two patients could represent a therapy-related secondary malignancy. Thus, 11q23 translocations may occur preferentially in stem cells that are more susceptible to treatment-induced malignant transformation.\r"

The expressions of CD25 (Tac), CD28, T9 (transferrin receptor), and Ki-67 (proliferating cell nuclear antigen) Ags were high, and that of CD7 Ag was low in both acute and chronic ATL cells compared with that in normal T cells. The expressions of T9 and Ki-67 Ags were higher in acute ATL cells than in chronic ATL cells. The expression of CD38 Ag was higher in acute ATL cells but not in chronic ATL cells compared with normal T cells. On the contrary, the expression of HLA-DR Ag on the cell surface and the transcript of the HLA-DR Ag gene were high in chronic ATL cells, but not in acute ATL cells. A high percentage of lymph node ATL cells expressed T9, CD38, and Ki-67 Ags, although the peripheral blood ATL cells of the same patients showed significantly lower levels of expression of the same Ags. Interestingly, CD7 and HLA-DR Ags were detected on the majority of lymph node ATL cells. Moderately high percentage of smoldering ATL cells expressed CD25, CD28, and HLA-DR Ags, though a few numbers of leukemic cells were present in the samples. These findings confirm that the modes of activation of ATL cells in different clinical stages differ, and suggest that the differences might be reflected in the clinical features. The low expression of HLA-DR Ag in acute ATL cells, despite high expression of the Ag in chronic ATL cells, suggests that successive events that suppress HLA-DR Ag expression are necessary for the transformation of chronic ATL cells into acute ATL cells. Moreover, the high expressions of T9, CD38, Ki-67, CD7, and HLA-DR Ags on lymph node ATL cells indicate that ATL cells preferentially proliferate in lymph nodes.\r"

By monitoring this process, it is also possible to determine the recovery of the bone marrow. The amount of viable hematopoietic tissue plays a fundamental role in determining whether the patient is able to undergo further antineoplastic therapy, particularly chemotherapy. We examined 35 patients who had been treated with radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma (12), uterine cervix carcinoma (nine), ovarian dysgerminoma (six), testicular seminoma (four), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (four). We observed that radiation-induced modifications of the MRI pattern in the bone marrow are tightly linked to two parameters; the administered radiation dose and the length of time passed after the treatment. Bone marrow recovery was observed only when patients were treated with doses lower than 50 Gy. The earlier radiation-induced modifications of the bone marrow MRI pattern occurred 6 to 12 months after irradiation, and they were most evident 5 to 6 years after the treatment. From 2 to 9 years after radiotherapy, we observed partial recovery. Complete recovery, when it occurred, was observed only 10 to 23 years after the treatment. Our results indicate that MRI studies are likely to be useful in the assessment of radiation-induced injuries.\r"

An in vivo role for thrombin (IIa) inhibition by HCII in the presence of certain glycosaminoglycans (dermatan sulfate and heparin) can be proposed. Many proteins, such as complement components, can be proteolyzed to generate secondary bioactive molecules. HCII is a substrate for the human neutrophil (PMN) proteinases cathepsin G (CG) and elastase (LE). We found that degradation of HCII by CG or LE generated products with potent PMN chemotactic activity, which did not stimulate the PMN oxidative burst. Our results suggest that HCII may be a physiologic regulator of the acute inflammatory response.\r"

  ".U": "89229402\r", 
  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were raised against cytochrome b558, a membrane-bound component of the NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase in human neutrophils. This cytochrome consists of a low-molecular-weight (low-mol-wt) subunit of 22 to 23 Kd, probably encoded by an autosomal gene, and a high-mol-wt subunit of 75 to 90 Kd, encoded on the X-chromosome. MoAb 449 reacts with the low-mol-wt subunit and MoAb 48 with the high-mol-wt subunit on Western blots of purified cytochrome b558 and on blots of whole neutrophil extracts. In extracts of neutrophils from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) in which cytochrome b558 is not detectable by spectrophotometric methods, the low-mol-wt subunit is present, albeit in a much smaller amount. The high-mol-wt subunit is not detected by MoAb 48 in neutrophils of patients with X-linked CGD and in neutrophils of patients with the autosomal, cytochrome-b558-negative form of the disease. These results can be explained by a marked instability of these subunits when the synthesis of either of the two is disturbed. In differentiated HL-60 cells, the high-mol-wt subunit appears to be present in a different form. Cloning of the low-mol-wt subunit with the help of MoAb 449 suggests the presence of a heme-binding site on this subunit. By comparison of the binding characteristics of MoAb 449 to intact and permeabilized neutrophils with those of MoAb 7D5, recently isolated by Nakamura et al (Blood 69:1404, 1987), the low-mol-wt subunit was established as a transmembrane protein.\r"

This was correlated with turnover of the phosphoinositides as well as RBC deformability during the process since phosphoinositide metabolism may be involved in shape regulation of RBCs. Echinocytic shape transformation and subsequent vesiculation of RBCs, which commonly occur during ATP depletion, were inhibited by chlorpromazine. Furthermore, with a newly developed two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography separation of RBC membrane phospholipids, we showed that chlorpromazine significantly decreased the dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in both ATP-depleted RBCs as well as in cells with partly maintained ATP levels. Concomitantly, there was a smaller increase in the relative amount of phosphatidylinositol. In addition, chlorpromazine also inhibited the decreased in RBC deformability as well as the shift of osmotic fragility that occurs during ATP depletion of erythrocytes.\r"

The three persons with a heterozygosity for the--101 C----T mutation had normal hematologic data without microcytosis but with high-normal levels of Hb A2 and a mild imbalance in chain synthesis.

We have determined the nucleotide sequence for a portion of the mcr, and constructed oligonucleotides that were used to perform the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in conjunction with universal immunoglobulin primers to specifically amplify t(14;18) breakpoints in DNA obtained from follicular lymphomas. Eight of ten breakpoints that were detectable on Southern blots using DNA probes for the mcr could be detected due to specific amplification by the PCR technique using an mcr-specific primer. Direct nucleotide sequencing of the enzymatically amplified DNAs showed that the breakpoints clustered within a 500 nucleotide region, and five occurred within three nucleotides of each other. These data show a remarkable clustering of some t(14;18) breakpoints at a site on chromosome 18, at least a 30-kb distance from the bcl-2 gene. Our findings also indicate that mcr-specific primers may be used in conjunction with previously described mbr-specific primers in a highly sensitive DNA amplification technique to detect a large fraction of t(14;18) breakpoints.\r"

Ascites (n = 9) MCs as well as enzymatically dispersed MCs from all organs tested (lung n = 11, skin n = 7, intestinum n = 10) exhibited an identical marker profile. MCs were recognized by MoAbs clustered as CD9 (anti-gp24), CD33 (anti-gp67), and CD45 (anti-gp220) as well as by MoAbs directed against membrane-bound IgE. MoAB YB5B8 (anti-gp145) selectively recognized MCs. Most significantly, however, MCs were stained by MoAbs MAX1 (anti-gp65), MAX3 (anti-gp68), MAX11 (anti-gp65), and MAX24 (anti-gp65). These antibodies bind to surface membrane antigens associated with a late stage of monocyte/macrophage differentiation. Thus, our results provide definite evidence that MCs share surface membrane markers with mononuclear phagocytes. In contrast, MCs are stained neither by lymphatic markers (CD1-8, 10, 19-24) nor by myelomonocytic markers (CD11-17). MCs also lack the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (CD25), the T10 antigen (CD38), and most of the myelocytic markers expressed on peripheral blood (PB) basophils. Thus, MCs displayed a unique phenotype within the hematopoietic system. This new approach enabled us to enrich human lung MCs to a purity greater than 95% by means of negative selection with complement-mediated cell lysis. Purified MCs were subsequently stained with MoAbs and analyzed by flow cytometry, which confirmed the results obtained from the double-staining experiments. We next examined cultured metachromatic cells derived from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood colony-forming units (CFU). These metachromatic cells previously could not be classified by morphologic criteria alone and have therefore been termed basophil-like/MC-like cells. In this study, toluidine blue-positive cells obtained from either pooled multipotential colonies (day 14-CFU-GEM) or pooled myelocytic colonies (day 16/17-CFU-GM/G/M) were recognized by MoAbs MY7 (CD13), VIM12 (CD11b), and VIM2, as well as by an anti-IgE MoAb, after preincubation with IgE. In contrast, CFU-derived metachromatic cells were not stained by MoAb YB5B8. This marker profile corresponds to the immunologic phenotype of blood basophils and excluded a detectable formation of mature MCs in colonies derived from cultured hematopoietic stem cells.\r"

Granulopoiesis persisted up to 40 days (mean duration 25 days) after passaged stroma were recharged with stromal cell-depleted target cells in a two-stage liquid marrow culture system. Although equal to marrow fibroblasts in their ability to bind CD34+ myeloid progenitors, stromal layers were better at supporting granulopoiesis. This system provides an in vitro model to characterize the components of stroma and stroma-cytomatrix that enhance marrow progenitor cell localization and maintenance.\r"

  ".W": "We introduce a new method for preparing subpopulations of guinea pig megakaryocytes (MK). MK, partially purified by a density gradient, were separated according to size by sedimentation, starting as a monolayer, in an albumin gradient at unit gravity. Twenty-two fractions were collected. Cells were cytocentrifuged, ploidy was assessed by microdensitometry, and small MK were identified with anti-von Willebrand factor (vWF) immunoglobulin. Immaturity was assessed by uptake of 3H thymidine and synthesis of proteoglycans from 35S sulfate. About 88% of cells in fractions 2 through 18 were MK, of which 90% were viable. Fractions containing the largest cells were composed of 98% stage III and IV MK; fractions with the smallest cells contained up to 80% stage I and II MK. Six MK classes were isolated: immature cells, both stage I and II cells, at either the 8N, 16N or 32N ploidy class; mature cells, both stage III and IV cells, at either the 8N, 16N or 32N ploidy class. The fractions were pooled into three groups: (a) 8% of MK in group 1, fractions 2 through 11, were immature, and group 1 was composed of 92% of 16N and 32N mature classes; (b) 29% of MK in group 2, fractions 12 through 15, were immature, and group 2 was composed of 52% 16N mature, 24% 16N immature, and 13% 8N mature classes; 67% of MK in group 3, fractions 16 through 18, were immature, and group 3 contained 51% 8N immature, 14% 16N immature, and 18% mature 16N classes. The mean protein content of the three groups was 1.251, 0.624, and 0.284 mg/10(6) MK, respectively. Nine percent of cells in group 3 but no cells in group 1 took up large amounts of 3H thymidine. The synthesis of high-molecular-weight (high-mol-wt) proteoglycans in group 3 and synthesis of lower mol wt proteoglycans in groups 1 and 2 provided further evidence for differences in MK maturity. Thus, the method can isolate MK subpopulations that are viable and can be used to investigate the biochemical characteristics of MK at different phases of maturation.\r"

We have studied synthesis, cellular distribution, and molecular characteristics of PG by a cloned interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line, FDCP-1, which is cloned from murine long-term marrow cultures. Under appropriate conditions the cell can differentiate into granulocytes and macrophages, and therefore, can be considered CFU-GM equivalent. The pattern of PG synthesis was studied by 35SO4 labeling. FDCP-1 cells actively synthesize PG, which are distributed in the intracellular, membrane-associated (MP), and extracellular pools. After purification of the 35S-labeled material by ion-exchange and gel filtration techniques, a single chondroitin sulfate-PG (CIS-PG) was observed to be present in the three studied pools. By Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, this PG has a Kav of 0.47, which after alkaline treatment is shifted to a Kav of 0.67. This indicates the proteoglycan nature of the 35SO4-labeled material. The MP CIS-PG is not stable. It is released to the culture medium where it is subsequently processed. However, in the presence of hematopoietic stromal cells D2X, the stability of MP proteoglycan of FDCP-1 cells is enhanced, suggesting that the synthesis of PG by progenitor cells and its accumulation in the membrane may have a role in the interaction between progenitor and stromal cells.\r"

  ".U": "89229429\r", 
  ".W": "The relative contribution of several mechanisms to plasminogen activation and fibrin dissolution by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) in vitro was quantitated. The activation of plasminogen by recombinant single chain u-PA (rscu-PA), by its two chain derivative (rtcu-PA) and by a plasmin-resistant mutant, rscu-PA-Glu158, obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics with catalytic efficiencies of 0.00064, 0.046, and 0.00005 L/mumol.s for native plasminogen (Glu-plasminogen) and of 0.0061, 1.21, and 0.0004 L/mumol.s for partially degraded plasminogen (Lys-plasminogen). In a purified system consisting of a fibrin clot submerged in a plasminogen solution, the equi-effective doses (50% lysis in one hour) for rscu-PA, rtcu-PA, and rscu-PA-Glu158 were 16, 6.5, and 32,000 ng/mL for Glu-plasminogen and two- to fourfold lower for Lys-plasminogen. In a plasma milieu, 50% lysis in two hours was obtained for a plasma clot with 2.1 micrograms/mL rscu-PA, 0.5 micrograms/mL rtcu-PA, and greater than 200 micrograms/mL rscu-PA-Glu158 and for a purified fibrin clot with 1.3 micrograms/mL rscu-PA and 0.27 microgram/mL rtcu-PA. After predigestion of a purified fibrin clot with plasmin, the apparent potency of rscu-PA and rtcu-PA increased by 40% and 20%, respectively. In conclusion, rscu-PA has an intrinsic plasminogen activating potential that is only about 1% of that of rtcu-PA and that is 13 times higher than that of rscu-PA-Glu158. Conformational transition of Glu-plasminogen to Lys-plasminogen enhances its sensitivity to activation by all u-PA moieties ten- to 20-fold. Predigestion of fibrin clots with associated increased binding of plasminogen results in a minor apparent increase of the fibrinolytic potency of rscu-PA and rtcu-PA. The relative fibrinolytic potency of rtcu-PA is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of rscu-PA-Glu158 but only two- to five-fold higher than that of rscu-PA, both in purified systems and in a plasma milieu. These results indicate that conversion of rscu-PA to rtcu-PA constitutes the primary mechanism of fibrin dissolution.\r"

  ".W": "The development of tension in platelet-rich clots is a manifestation of fibrin polymer binding to platelets as well as platelet contractile activity. Arg-Gly-Asp(RGD)-containing peptides of fibrinogen alpha-chain and gamma-400-411 of fibrinogen gamma chain increased clot tension considerably, especially when it developed under isometric conditions. Morphometry revealed increased confluence of oriented fibrin and platelet aggregates. Monoclonal antibodies directed against different epitopes on the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex had varying effects on clot tension development. Monoclonal antibodies A2A9 and 7E3 inhibited clot tension while T10 and 10E5 increased it. Since neither peptides nor antibodies affected the platelet actomyosin ATPase activity, their effect on tension must reflect the interaction between platelets and polymerizing fibrin. We conclude that gamma-400-411 and RGD-peptides increase platelet-polymerizing fibrin interaction. This suggests that clot tension requires a platelet receptor for polymerizing fibrin, which is different from the fibrinogen receptor domain required for aggregation. The results with the monoclonal antibodies support this hypothesis.\r"

  ".U": "89229433\r", 
  ".W": "The intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) is a cell-surface molecule which binds to leukocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) and regulates both leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and immune functions requiring cell-cell contact. Membrane expression of ICAM-1 is highly regulated on all hematopoietic lineages. Cell membrane antigen is significantly expressed on a small subset of bone marrow (BM) progenitors but is weak or absent on all cell lineages once they enter the circulation. However, strong expression on tissue macrophages and germinal center B cells suggested that activated cells may show upregulated expression. When B cells, T cells, macrophages, or granulocytes were activated in vitro by suitable mitogens, ICAM-1 expression was induced in all cases. Parallel studies of hematopoietic tumors demonstrated a heterogeneity of expression which correlated with expression on their normal cellular counterparts. In particular, a striking correlation between expression on B-cell tumors and corresponding stages of B-cell differentiation was noted. The widely varying expression of ICAM-1 contrasts with LFA-1 which, while variable, is nevertheless significantly positive at all stages of differentiation. This suggests that the major regulation of homotypic adhesion mediated by the LFA-1/ICAM-1 linkage occurs through control of ICAM-1 expression. In keeping with this notion, ICAM-1 expression was also correlated with the \"adhesiveness\" of B-lymphoid tumors. Large solitary lymphoma masses showed intense expression of ICAM-1. Conversely, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and lymphoma cells from tumors exhibiting diffuse, widespread lymph node disease showed weak expression. These observations are discussed in relation to the role of ICAM-1 in regulation of lymphoid recirculation and the biology of lymphoid tumors.\r"

Enrichment to greater than or equal to 93% plasma cells was confirmed with Wright's-Giemsa staining, with intracytoplasmic immunoglobulin staining, and with staining using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) directed at B, T, myeloid, monocytoid, and myeloma antigens in indirect immunofluorescence assays. Myeloma cells neither proliferated nor secreted Ig in response to G/M-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), or interleukin-4 (IL-4). Significant proliferation (SI greater than or equal to 3.0) was induced by interleukin-6 (IL-6) in six of ten patients (SI of 31 and 43 in two cases); and to interleukin-3 (IL-3) and interleukin-5 (IL-5), independently, in two patients each. Peak proliferation to IL-5 or IL-6 and to IL-3 occurred in cells pulsed with 3[H] thymidine at 24 and 48 hours, respectively; and proliferation to combinations of factors did not exceed that noted to IL-6 alone; Ig secretion was not documented under any culture conditions. Three myeloma-derived cell lines similarly studied demonstrated variable responses. The heterogeneity in the in vitro responses of myeloma cells and derived cell lines to exogenous growth factors enhances our understanding of abnormal plasma cell growth and may yield insight into the pathophysiology of plasma cell dyscrasias.\r"

In an attempt to minimize cell loss in cytopreparation, electrostatic binding of cells to poly-L-lysine (PLL)-coated multispot slides, followed by immunocytochemistry, was investigated. Using optimized conditions of cell attachment and fixation and performing all washing procedures on the slide made multimarker analysis possible even in paucicellular specimens, while preserving excellent cell morphology and yielding high sensitivity in the detection of antigens. In a study of 26 CSF specimens with inconclusive cytomorphology, comprising 335 single marker determinations, we were able to discriminate reliably between resting or activated benign cells and a wide range of types of malignant lymphoid cell. A definitive diagnosis was reached in all cases by one tap only. Malignant meningitis was ruled out in ten specimens and proved in 16, including five in which the type of malignancy could only be determined by immunophenotyping. We conclude that immunocytochemistry on PLL-coated slides constitutes the method of choice for immunologic cell differentiation in CSF, which allows equivocal morphologic findings to be clarified.\r"

  ".U": "89229440\r", 
  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have been prepared recently that recognize the three cell-surface receptors for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (Ig), termed Fc gamma RI (MoAb 32.2), Fc gamma R II (MoAb IV-3), and Fc gamma R III (MoAb 3G8) that are expressed on selected subsets of non-T lymphocyte peripheral blood leukocytes. In the blood, Fc gamma R I is expressed exclusively on monocytes and macrophages, Fc gamma R II on granulocytes, mononuclear phagocytes, platelets, and B cells, and Fc gamma R III on granulocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. We have examined the expression of these molecules on normal bone marrow (BM) cells and on leukemia cells from the blood and/or BM in order to determine their normal ontogeny as well as their distribution on leukemic cells. BM was obtained from six normal volunteers and from 170 patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia. Normal BM cells were found to express Fc gamma R I, II, and III with the following percentages: 40%, 58%, and 56%, respectively. Cell sorting revealed that both Fc gamma R I and Fc gamma R II were detectable on all subclasses of myeloid precursors as early as myeloblasts. Cell sorting experiments revealed that 66% of the granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) and 50% of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) were Fc gamma R II positive with only 20% and 28%, respectively, of CFU-GM and BFU-E were Fc gamma R I positive. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells expressed the three receptors with the following frequency (n = 146): Fc gamma R I, 58%; Fc gamma R II, 67%; and Fc gamma R III, 26% of patients. Despite the fact that Fc gamma R I is only expressed on monocytes among blood cells, AML cells without monocytoid differentiation (French-American-British [FAB]M1, M2, M3, M6) were sometimes positive for this receptor. However, Fc gamma R I was highly correlated with FAB M4 and M5 morphology (P less than .001). Fc gamma R II was also correlated with FAB M4 and M5 morphology (P = .003). Cells from 11 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were negative for Fc gamma R I, but six cases were positive for Fc gamma R II and III (not the same patients). These studies demonstrate that Ig Fc gamma R are acquired during normal differentiation in the BM at or before the level of colony-forming units. In addition, we show that acute leukemia cells commonly express Fc gamma R.\r"

Since lysosomal hydrolases including the sulfatase underwent the posttranslational phosphorylation processing at the carbohydrate moiety, we investigated two enzymes acting on the processing in peripheral leukocytes from leukemia patients. The activity level of the first enzyme in the processing, an N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase to form phosphodiester at the carbohydrates, was significantly higher in CML cells than in normal control. The transferase level in CML cells was also higher compared with that in normal bone marrow cells, which include myeloid progenitor cells. However, the activity of the second processing enzyme, a phosphodiester glycosidase that converts a phosphodiester to a phosphomonoester, showed no consistent change in CML cells. Thus, increment of the sulfatase variant containing phosphomonoesters and diesters in CML cells is most probably associated with elevated activities of the phosphotransferase. In two cases of CML in blastic crisis and a case of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), activity of the processing enzyme was considerably decreased concomitant with reduction of peripheral blastic cells by chemotherapy.\r"

In 85 of these cases (62%), structural chromosomal abnormalities were also present; clinical and laboratory features in this group did not differ from those of the 53 cases with only numeric abnormalities. However, of the 28 failures seen at a median follow-up of 4 years, 22 occurred in cases with structural chromosomal abnormalities (P = .03 by Breslow test). In a multivariate analysis, only the presence of structural chromosomal abnormalities and male gender were independently associated with treatment failure. Structural chromosomal abnormalities in cases of ALL with greater than 50 chromosomes may define a biologically different form of leukemia characterized by increased likelihood of drug resistance.\r"

  ".W": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) with a deficiency of the complement receptor type 3 (CR3) membrane glycoprotein family have impairments in the ability to adhere to surfaces as well as chemotactic and phagocytic defects, processes that require a functional contractile apparatus. PMN from the patient with neutrophil actin dysfunction (NAD) displayed similar functional characteristics to those with CR3 deficiency suggesting the two disorders may be the same disease. In order to evaluate the relationship between CR3 deficiency and actin assembly, actin filament assembly was measured in PMN from six previously reported homozygotes (two severe and four moderate CR3-deficient patients) as well as five heterozygotes for CR3 deficiency. PMN from all patients had normal unstimulated concentrations of F-actin and after exposure to the chemotactic peptide FMLP (5 x 10(-7) mol/L for 5 to 40 seconds at 25 degrees C) assembled actin normally. Pretreatment of normal PMN with concentrations of monoclonal anti-alpha CR3 antibody, capable of blocking PMN adherence, also failed to impair FMLP-induced actin filament assembly. CR3 glycoprotein expression was measured in PMNs from the mother, father, and older sister of the NAD patient (N Engl J Med 291:1093, 1974). Actin filament assembly was recently shown to be defective in PMNs from all three family members. The total concentrations of the alpha and beta CR3 subunits were below normal in PMN detergent extracts from the mother (25% of simultaneous controls) and older sister (56% of control). PMN surface expression of these two subunits was also found to be depressed (mother, 50%; older sister, 63% of control). These findings suggest these two NAD family members are heterozygote carriers for CR3 deficiency as well as NAD. Simultaneous studies of the father, however, demonstrated normal total concentrations of both the alpha and beta CR3 subunits (126% of controls) as well as normal surface expression of both subunits after phorbol myristate acetate stimulation and incubation at 37 degrees C (mean, 112% of controls) but slightly lower than normal levels after FMLP stimulation (mean, 83%). These findings indicate that CR3 deficiency generally is not associated with defective actin filament assembly and support the conclusion that NAD represents a unique kindred in which PMN actin function differs from previously reported genotypes of CR3 deficiency.\r"

Using this criterion, we studied a patient with complete hereditary MPO deficiency, and a MPO deficient variant cell line of HL-60 (HL-60-A7), which we used as a model for acquired MPO deficiency. Western blot analysis showed complete absence of mature and precursor protein of MPO both in PMN from the patient and in HL-60-A7 cells. PMN from both parents had one half of normal levels of these proteins. To study further the molecular basis of this defect, we isolated an intron specific probe for MPO and used it and a cDNA probe. Both normal human bone marrow cells and the promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells contained MPO mRNA species of 2.8, 3.3, approximately 4, and greater than 8 kilobase (kb). The transcripts of greater than 8 and approximately 4 kb contained sequences hybridizing to a probe specific for intron 7 of the MPO gene. Bone marrow cells of the MPO deficient patient contained two species of heterogeneous nuclear (hn) RNA of greater than 8 and approximately 4 kb, but only trace amounts of the normal sized 3.3 kb MPO mRNA and undetectable 2.8 kb MPO mRNA. HL-60-A7 cells contained both greater than 8 and approximately 4 kb hnRNA, but only small amounts of normal sized 2.8 kb MPO mRNA and undetectable levels of the 3.3 kb mRNA. Southern blot analyses revealed no gross alteration of the MPO gene in both cases. Our results suggest that a pretranslational defect is one mechanism leading to MPO deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "Hemoglobin Constant Spring is an elongation mutation of the alpha 2-globin locus that results in a thalassemic phenotype. It has a high prevalence in Asian populations. When inherited with other alpha-thalassemia determinants, the Constant Spring gene has the potential to cause severe forms of alpha-thalassemia. Accurate diagnosis of the condition with standard hemoglobin electrophoresis is unreliable due to the small to undetectable amounts of the mutant hemoglobin present. Because of the extensive sequence homology of the alpha 1 and alpha 2 loci, allele-specific hybridization to total genomic DNA containing the Constant Spring gene would not distinguish between heterozygous and homozygous hemoglobin Constant Spring. Selective enzymatic amplification of alpha 2-globin DNA sequences, however, allows unambiguous diagnoses to be made using allele-specific hybridization. This method is useful for providing accurate genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in populations and specific families in which precise diagnosis is important.\r"

The model provided an experimental system in which the calcium mineral content and the rate of mineralization both changed progressively throughout its development. A significant linear correlation was found between 45Ca and 32P uptake and the rate of calcium mineralization, which held for all stages of the graft's growth. Both radiotracers therefore accurately reflected the calcium mineral deposition. In the case of 99Tcm-MDP, the correlation with mineralization rate only applied for the most active growth period of the graft when the rate was increasing. For all radiotracers, the peak in bone uptake corresponded to the maximum in mineralization rate.\r"

This relationship has enabled the experimental findings to be extrapolated to those in patient studies and has shown that in sclerotic bone lesions, the increase in 99Tcm-MDP uptake accompanying the progression of the metastases was proportional to the rate of calcification.\r"

This loss of chromatin can occur through chromosomal deletions or through the formation of asymmetrical chromosomal exchanges. It is proposed that smaller doses of radiation produce fewer chromatin breaks, which are more likely to be accurately repaired, compared with larger doses. Consequently, smaller doses of radiation are less efficient in causing cell death, leading to a shoulder on the cell survival curve. Experimental evidence supports this model, and the fit between the derived formula and experimental cell survival curves is good. The derived formula approximates to the linear-quadratic equation at low doses of radiation.\r"

The ratios of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) at a depth of 12 cm to that at 2 cm were found by the two groups to be 0.99 +/- 0.04 and 0.96 +/- 0.02 (standard errors). The effect of a polythene filter 4.5 cm thick was measured at a depth of 2 cm and the ratio of RBE with and without the filter was found by both groups to be 0.99 +/- 0.02.

Single, spin-echo sequences with eight different repetition times and a four-echo sequence were used to calculate T1 and T2 in tumour and normal liver, and the proton density tumour-liver quotient, before and during treatment with interferon. Changes over time of these parameters were compared with variations in tumour marker levels and changes in size and number of the metastases. During therapy, six out of eight cases showed a decrease in tumour T1, five responding to therapy and one with stationary disease, while the two patients with progressive disease showed unchanged tumour T1. The proton density quotient also decreased in a corresponding way, indicating a change in water content in tumours responding to interferon therapy. No significant change in liver T1, tumour T2 or liver T2 occurred in any patient. It is thus possible to perform reliable measurements of relaxation parameters over time, which may be valuable in follow-up of tumour treatment.\r"

The patients were in contact with the cuprophane membrane over 45 or 90 min. Twenty-five (+/- 5) minutes after the start of the dialysis, the peripheral leucocyte count (59 +/- 22%) and the 111In activity in the peripheral blood decreased to a minimum of their initial range (64 +/- 21%) because of leucocyte activation. The activity over both lungs increased symmetrically (29 +/- 15%), the spleen activity decreased (14.8 +/- 8%) and the liver activity remained constant. At the end of the dialysis (45-90 min post-injection), the number of circulating neutrophils, peripheral 111In activity and activity distribution in the organs regained their initial level. In conclusion, these data confirm previously described data concerning the sequestration of neutrophils into the lung during dialysis treatment. The data demonstrate the origin of the activated neutrophils in the circulation and the spleen. The identical behaviour of 111In-oxine-labelled and unlabelled granulocytes is demonstrated. Additionally, the accumulation of activity in the spleen is due not to opsonized cells but to sequestrated neutrophils, which are able to migrate from the spleen after adequate activation. The migration of activated cells into the lung explains the diagnostic difficulties posed by diffuse lung uptake in leucocyte scans in patients with leucocyte-activating diseases.\r"

Surviving fractions were assayed by the colony-forming method. The cell uptake curve was upward concave with increasing activity and was saturated after an incubation time of 60 min. A clonogenic assay resulted in an exponential dose-survival curve with a shoulder (D0 of 0.44 MBq/ml (12 microCi/ml); n = 5), and an upward concave time-survival relationship.

Animals with reflux in association with low voiding pressures and normal bladder function (n = 5), as well as those with raised voiding pressures and abnormal bladder function (n = 7), were investigated with appropriate non-refluxing controls (n = 12). Urinary infection and renal scarring were avoided since these factors may affect kidney function and growth independently. Statistical tests of difference failed to demonstrate any effect of VUR on renal growth or renal uptake of 99mTc DMSA even in the presence of elevated voiding pressures and abnormal detrusor function.\r"

  ".W": "Oxalate excretion was measured in healthy subjects and idiopathic calcium stone-formers on dietary regimens which differed in the type and amount of protein allowed; 24-h urine collections were obtained from 41 practising vegetarians and 40 normal persons on a free, mixed, \"mediterranean\" diet. Twenty idiopathic calcium stone-formers were also studied while on two low calcium, low oxalate diets which differed in that animal protein was high in one and restricted in the other. Vegetarians had higher urinary oxalate levels than controls and although the calcium levels were markedly lower, urinary saturation with calcium/oxalate was significantly higher. This mild hypercalciuria was interpreted as being secondary to both a higher intake and increased fractional intestinal absorption of oxalate. Changing calcium stone-formers from a high to a low animal protein intake produced a significant decrease in calcium excretion but there was no variation in urinary oxalate. As a result, the decrease in calcium oxalate saturation was only marginal and not significant. It was concluded that dietary animal protein has a minimal effect on oxalate excretion. Mild hyperoxaluria of idiopathic calcium stone disease is likely to be intestinal in origin. Calcium stone-formers should be advised to avoid an excess of animal protein but the risks of a vegetable-rich diet should also be borne in mind.\r"

Post-micturition plain abdominal radiography is considerably cheaper than ultrasound and appears to be equally effective in the determination of residual urine. Its use as the sole imaging technique in the routine management of bladder outflow obstruction is recommended.\r"

The silicone/latex catheter caused considerably more complement activation in both assays than did the all-silicone one. The findings are in agreement with previous results of tissue toxicity tests. The methods presented may prove valuable for the practical purpose of testing the biocompatibility of urinary catheters.\r"

Basal pressure was low at high level filling, but pressure waves with amplitudes of 40 to 50 cm H2O occurred every other minute. The reservoir's functional adaptation, revealed as a diminished amplitude of pressure waves and evident soon after its construction, remained stable at long-term follow-up. Subcutaneously injected atropine or terbutaline did not influence the basal pressure but increased the volume at which the first pressure wave appeared and decreased the wave amplitude and frequency at high filling levels. Intra-reservoir instillation of these drugs did not alter the dynamic behaviour of the reservoir. In selected patients, orally administered anticholinergic drugs or beta 2-adrenoceptor agonists may be useful in the management of hyperactivity in a colonic segment used as a continent reservoir or bladder substitute.\r"

A new method of urodynamic evaluation was performed using a multitransducer-catheter, 5 microtransducers inside the urethra and 1 in the bladder, connected to a computer and graphic plotter. Single coughs were analysed with the catheter in a fixed position and the patient in the standing position. The operation, which was successful, in all but 1 patient, did not alter urethral pressure at rest, but urethral closure pressure at stress after the operation (mean 45.0 cm H2O (SD 21.6) was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) than the -3.6 cm H2O (SD 10.2) recorded before the operation. The pressure transmission ratio was less than 100% in 22 patients before the operation and more than 100% in 18 patients afterwards, the pre- and post-operative mean values being 78.9% (SD 11.9) and 109.5% (SD 17.2) respectively (P less than 0.0005). Burch colposuspension markedly improves urethral closure function as evaluated by this method, which analyses the pressure data at different points of the urethra and bladder during one single cough.\r"

All patients have been treated successfully, with a good calibre urethra visible on urethrography and direct endoscopy and with improved urine flow rates. The mean follow-up of these patients was 7 months (range 2-13). Urethroscopy demonstrated complete epithelial covering of the implant in 4 to 6 months. Although the follow-up period was short, it seems that this simple technique may offer a lasting treatment for many urethral strictures. A longer follow-up will be necessary to exclude late complications.\r"

A prospective, randomised study was undertaken to investigate the role of the transurethral catheter in stricture formation. A total of 205 patients subjected to TURP were studied. Following resection, they were randomly divided into 2 groups: those drained by a transurethral siliconised latex catheter and those drained by a suprapubic siliconised latex catheter. At follow-up, 6 to 24 months later, 17% of the patients in the transurethral group had developed urethral stricture; the corresponding figure in the suprapubic group was 4%. As a consequence of the higher incidence of stricture in the transurethrally drained group, more patients in that group were dissatisfied with the results of the operation. It was concluded that the post-operative transurethral catheter was an important factor in stricture formation following TURP and that transurethral drainage with a siliconised latex catheter resulted in a higher incidence of stricture. This led to a greater number of patients being dissatisfied with the results of the operation, but the catheter did not affect the results in any other way.\r"

Minor complications are described. A significantly higher complication rate was associated with a perurethral than with a suprapubic catheter; 5 of the 38 patients in whom a suprapubic catheter was used developed complications requiring reconstructive surgery. Possible causes of the complications are discussed and the results compared with those of other methods.
