  ".W": "Infants, children, and adolescents with chronic respiratory failure are surviving in increasing numbers and, thereby, producing a significant population of ventilator-dependent pediatric patients. Chronic respiratory failure can occur as a complication of a wide variety of disease states; in pathophysiologic terms, it generally results from either decreased central nervous system output or inadequate force generated by the respiratory pump. Its laboratory hallmark is hypercapnia with or without hypoxemia. Stabilization of the patient with mechanical ventilatory support may permit long-term survival. Management of the ventilator-dependent pediatric patient is a complex task that must begin with an accurate prognostication of each patient's survival and quality of life. Once a decision is made concerning the practicality and appropriateness of long-term ventilatory support, informed choices must be made with respect to need for an artificial airway, mode of ventilation, and location of care. Many younger patients, especially those with intrinsic lung disease (like bronchopulmonary dysplasia), may require a hospital setting for long-term care, whereas others with neuromuscular or central disorders may benefit from being discharged to home. The patient's family must be thoroughly educated in the child's care, and they must be involved in decision-making. A multidisciplinary team of physicians, therapists, nurses, and other professionals is required to deliver optimal care. Outcome is good for most patients who are carefully selected.\r"

Experiences obtained from this case and the existing literature suggest that (1) in persons with quadriplegia, plasma catecholamine levels show little increase with sitting, indicating an inability to activate baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, (2) elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels indicate a renal compensatory response to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low plasma volume and/or chronic hypotension, and (3) the net effect of ergotamine and fludrocortisone is probably a combination of plasma volume expansion and direct peripheral vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "In asymptomatic patients the importance of silent ischemic ST-T wave changes on Holter monitoring is known to be a significant predictive variable for one-year mortality of postmyocardial infarction patients. This case report represents the uses of ambulatory ECG to detect ischemic ST changes in patients who have had recent strokes. The cases reported here of silent myocardiac ischemia in stroke patients reflect previous reports in which 70% of the ischemic episodes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease are not associated with angina and in which approximately 10% to 15% of acute myocardial infarctions are silent. We now believe that the incidence of \"silent\" ischemia may be precipitated in poststroke patients during their rehabilitation program. This belief is supported by two main factors. First, a high level of personally relevant mental stress exists which activates the sympathoadrenal system, which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Second, some stroke patients become aphasic and are unable to communicate adequately even if they experience angina symptoms. We have found that poststroke, most patients could not undergo exercise treadmill testing secondary to a variety of factors: inability to coordinate limbs, poor endurance, inability to follow directions, and/or lack of attention. We now propose that 24-hour monitoring for ST-T wave changes poststroke should be considered as part of a vigorous investigation for myocardial ischemia during the rehabilitation of these patients because they have an increased risk of cardiac morbidity.\r"

Peak knee extension torque was measured isokinetically and isometrically. Endurance, or the amount of time the subject could maintain isometric torque at 40% of maximal torque, was measured. Work capacity was determined as the product of isometric torque and endurance time. Recovery of strength was measured at regular intervals for ten minutes after the endurance test. Statistical analysis was done by repeated measures ANOVA. Although the initial measures showed significant deficits in mean peak torque, work capacity, and recovery of strength in symptomatic postpolio subjects, no significant changes were found one year later in any of the variables. We conclude that symptomatic postpolio subjects do not lose significant neuromuscular function in one year.\r"

Studies were done 15 hours following a single dose of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg). Renal blood flow and arterial glutamine concentration were similar in control and study rats, but the kidney switched from an organ of slight glutamine uptake in controls (129 +/- 52 nmol/100 g of body weight per minute) to net release in the endotoxin-treated animals (-273 +/- 170 nmol/100 g of body weight per minute). Simultaneously, the specific activity of renal glutamine synthetase increased by almost 50% (374 +/- 40 nmol/mg of protein per hour in rats given endotoxin vs 253 +/- 12 nmol/mg of protein per hour in controls), while glutaminase was unchanged. Urinary ammonia excretion was reduced by 35% in the endotoxin-treated animals (47 +/- 6 mumol/12 h in endotoxin-treated animals vs 70 +/- 8 mumol/12 h in controls) despite a 10% fall in the arterial bicarbonate value. Endotoxin alters the net flux of glutamine across the kidney which appears to be partially regulated enzymatically. This may impair the kidneys' ability to maintain acid/base homeostasis.\r"

To evaluate the possible interaction of the hepatic-pulmonary macrophage axis in the adult respiratory distress syndrome, we compared the kinetics of immunosuppressive prostaglandin E2, TNF-alpha, and interleukin 6 production in LPS-stimulated Kupffer cells and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Interleukin 6 production by Kupffer cells was significantly higher than for equal numbers of AMs. Kupffer cell TNF-alpha levels peaked early before decreasing as regulatory prostaglandin E2 levels rose. In contrast, AM TNF-alpha levels rose sharply and remained significantly higher than for Kupffer cells throughout culture coincident with negligible prostaglandin E2 production. Kupffer cell sequestration of LPS may normally invoke a coordinated cytokine response able to locally induce acute-phase hepatocytes. In hepatic failure, however, LPS spillover to the lung may promote adult respiratory distress syndrome by inducing unregulated AM TNF-alpha production within the pulmonary microenvironment.\r"

To determine the route of bacterial translocation, different dosages of zymosan were used to activate complement and cause systemic inflammation. At a zymosan dose of 0.1 mg/g, bacteria translocated only to the mesenteric lymph node complex, whereas at a dose of 0.5 mg/g the bacteria translocated systematically. In rats receiving 0.5-mg/g doses of zymosan, the bacteria appeared to reach systemic organs via the portal blood rather than via the mesenteric lymph, as bacteria were present in 87% of portal blood samples but only 25% of lymph samples. The number of bacteria exiting the portal vein was 11,500 times greater than the number exiting via the lymph. Thus, both the route and extent of bacterial translocation varies based on the magnitude of the inflammatory insult, with the portal blood being the major route of bacterial translocation to systemic organs.\r"

Factors that appear to have markedly reduced bacterial burn wound infection, including patient isolation, topical chemotherapeutic agents, and burn wound excision, do not appear to have had a similar effect on fungal wound infection.

The number of C3b receptors on the neutrophil cell-surface was used as the indicator of activation, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Incubation of buffy-coat neutrophils with TNF-alpha for 30 minutes at 37 degrees C caused neutrophil activation, increasing C3b receptor-dependent fluorescence from 340 with buffer alone to 580 with TNF (250 pg/mL). Increasing amounts of anti-TNF IgG progressively inhibited neutrophil activation by TNF (250 pg/mL). Addition of the active dose range of anti-TNF to neutrophils incubating in endotoxin (10 ng/mL) did not affect the degree of endotoxin-mediated neutrophil activation. Mixtures of neutrophils with the 50% suppressive dose of anti-TNF and varying endotoxin concentrations showed the same degree of neutrophil activation as mixtures without the antibody. Thus, an antibody that can inhibit TNF-mediated neutrophil activation does not inhibit endotoxin-mediated neutrophil activation. We conclude that endotoxin and TNF can activate neutrophils through separate pathways.\r"

However, in the moderately contaminated rats (0.2 mL of fecal inoculate), fibrin aerosol reduced the 10-day mortality from 80% to 10%. In all survivors in the fibrin-treated group, intraperitoneal abscesses developed. With intraperitoneal bacterial concentrations of 2 x 10(6) organisms, early acute mortality from fibrinopurulent peritonitis is decreased at the expense of late, localized, nonlethal abscess formation. Aerosolized fibrin solution must be used with caution in contaminated surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Adherence to universal blood and body fluid precautions was studied in surgical patient care areas of a university hospital in an effort to identify potentially hazardous health care personnel practices. Surgical teams of an 18-unit operating room, three surgical ward patient care teams, and patient care personnel in a 16-bed surgical intensive care unit were observed during routine patient care activities before (study 1) and after (study 2) specific educational programs were held to improve universal precaution compliance. Overall, infractions occurred in 57% of 549 observed procedures in study 1 and in 58% of 616 observed procedures in study 2. In study 1, infractions occurred in 75% of operating room procedures, 30% of surgical ward procedures, and 75% of surgical intensive care unit procedures. Study 2 procedure infraction rates were 81%, 32%, and 40%, respectively. Only surgical intensive care unit compliance significantly improved. Noncompliance with universal precautions occurs frequently during the care of patients who have undergone surgery, with the type of infraction and specific offender varying according to patient locale. These violations appear unamenable to one-time educational efforts. Substantial overall improvement may arise from ongoing educational programs directed at specific personnel who care for patients who have undergone surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with trauma. To elucidate factors that might lead to infection, we studied the epidemiologic characteristics of nosocomial infections in our patient population with trauma. During a 3.5-year period, 2496 patients were entered into our hospital trauma registry and cross-matched with hospital infection control surveillance information. Two hundred twenty-nine patients with trauma and nosocomial infections were identified (9.2%), a figure that was nearly twice the nosocomial infection rate for the general hospital population. The majority of those infected were either orthopedic (51%), general surgical (25%), or neurosurgical (13%) patients. The most common sites of first infection were urinary tract (61%) or respiratory system (14%). Patients developing nosocomial infections were significantly older and had a higher Injury Severity Score than those who did not. Injury site was related to risk of infection with injuries of the spine, chest, and extremity showing the most significant relationship. The length of stay as well as hospital charges were significantly related to the occurrence of infectious complications. By determining the patient with trauma at risk for infection, treatment strategies can be designed to minimize septic complications.\r"

Ninety-six children had barium enema studies for suspected intussusception. Of the 57 children who had barium enema confirmed intussusception, 29 did not have history or physical findings of gross blood per rectum. Stool was tested for occult blood in 16 of these 29 patients, and 12 (75%) were positive. In comparison, three (20%) of the children who did not have intussusception had stool positive for occult blood. Stool with occult blood was significantly associated with intussusception (P less than .002). The only other clinical factor significantly associated with intussusception was abdominal mass (P less than .02). Vomiting, episodic irritability, poor feeding, abdominal pain and lethargy were not significantly different in the two groups. In conclusion, the authors suggest stool testing for occult blood when evaluating children who present with nonspecific signs and symptoms supportive of intussusception.\r"

The authors prospectively administered oral indomethacin, 50 mg, to 25 nonvomiting patients with acute renal colic due to a documented stone. Eleven patients group (I) received the drug in an unblinded, nonrandomized fashion after failure of oral or parenteral narcotics to provide satisfactory pain relief, either at home or in the emergency department. In 14 additional patients group (II) indomethacin was given as the only initial treatment. Pain intensity before and after treatment was reported using a 1-to-10 scale. In group I, pain decreased from 5.8 +/- 2.7 to 3.6 +/- 3.8 (P less than .02). Six of the 11 patients reported a decrease in pain intensity of 50% or more, which occurred within 25 +/- 11 minutes, and in 5 of these 6, pain decreased to a 0 or 1 level. In group II, pain decreased from 7.6 +/- 1.5 to 4.6 +/- 4.0 (P less than .008). Eight of the 14 patients reported a decrease in pain intensity of 50% or more, which occurred within 40 +/- 14 minutes, and in 5 of these 8 pain decreased to a 0 or 1 level. Among all 25 patients who received indomethacin, pain relief was not significantly associated with the duration of pain before treatment or with patient age or sex. There was a trend for pretreatment pain intensity to be higher among nonresponders (P = .07).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Peak flow rates were measured and maximum tidal volumes (MTV) calculated for each combination of cannula and oxygen source. Standard 22, 20, 18, and 16 gauge intravenous catheters and a 14 gauge cannula designed for pediatric jet ventilation were tested. The oxygen sources evaluated included an adult bag-valve device; a continuous flow source regulated between 6 to 15 L/min; and a high pressure jet source regulated between 5 to 50 psi. Mean calculated MTV delivered to the cannula tip (22 g to 14 g) were: 26 to 235 mL with the bag-valve source; 91 to 236 mL with the continuous flow sources; and 58 to 1034 mL with the jet sources. Assuming that in normal subjects approximately 70% of the flow from the tip of a translaryngeal cannula reaches the distal respiratory tree, the authors conclude that bag-valve and continuous flow low pressure sources are unlikely to deliver sufficient tidal volumes to sustain normal ventilation in apneic children when coupled with standard cannulae. Jet oxygen sources with standard cannulae provide a wide range of tidal volumes sufficient to sustain normal ventilation in apneic pediatric patients.\r"

Peak levels occurred at 4.2 and 4.5 hours, respectively, after ingestion, and levels drawn at 3 hours were within 90% of the peak. Nausea and headache were experienced by all volunteers, and serum iron exceeded baseline total iron binding capacity in two subjects at the 10 mg/kg dose. In minor iron overdose resulting from the ingestion of chewable vitamins, serum iron concentrations measured between 3 and 7 hours (95% confidence level of peak concentrations) may be adequate in assessing the peak serum iron concentration.\r"

Seatbelts reduced the total number of injuries by 34%, major injuries by 57%, and minor injuries by 20%. No deaths occurred among the belted group. The unbelted group had a mean Injury Severity Score two times as great as the belted group and were hospitalized 1.6 times longer at double the cost. Major injuries to the face, chest, and pelvic regions were prevented by the seatbelt. Among the belted group, severe injuries did occur to the head, neck, and abdominal regions.

The authors retrospectively examined the prehospital-based response for this multiple-casualty incident that used emergency medical service (EMS) physicians and 32 paramedics stationed at water and land-based posts to triage and evacuate 24 patients in 32 minutes. Patients were transported to 5 hospitals including 4 Level I trauma centers; this was accomplished in 53 minutes. The EMS response was unique in a number of respects. This was a prehospital-based rescue with the entire triage and stabilization phase accomplished by River Rescue units that transported paramedic divers, EMS physicians, and trauma supplies for 30 patients. Also of significance was the inordinate proportion of pediatric patients that accounted for 50% (12/24) of the cases. Successful medical care was the result of planning based on \"Daily Routine Doctrine\" or escalation of existing treatment protocol; adequate supplies, personnel and transport adapted to local geography and patient population; communications, including all services--EMS, police, and fire; and prehospital physician input to ensure correct triage order and patient disposition.\r"

Recently courts have begun scrutinizing readmission, course repetition, and cheating. Medical schools have accommodated to judicial scrutiny of general educational issues and have prevailed more often than claimants in litigation during this period, but litigation has not decreased as precedent and procedure have become clearer. Instead, litigation has continued unabated in alternative areas and at different levels of the educational process.\r"

This is true in part because establishing a valid and reliable method of assessing students' mastery of clinical skills has been a stumbling block. Reported here is the correlation of students' performances on an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) with previously and independently collected feedback from students. In 1987-88, 190 second-year medical students at the University of Minnesota Medical School--Minneapolis spent one fourth of a second-year clinical skills course on neurology randomly assigned to one of four teaching sites--hospitals A, B, C, and D. Following their rotations, 180 of the students completed usable feedback forms. The students were consistently and significantly more positive about the teaching at hospital A. At the end of the year, all 190 students were tested using an OSCE having 20 stations, four of which presented neurologic problems. The students who had the neurology course at hospital A performed better on all four neurology problems, and differences were statistically significant for two of the problems. Feedback in this case accurately reflected a more effective teaching program.\r"

This paper reports the authors' 1989 survey of 111 U.S. medical schools, and describes a death and dying seminar offered at the Yale School of Medicine using patients as teachers. Regarding the survey, the authors mailed questionnaires to 124 schools; 111 responded. Twelve of the schools (11%) provided no formal teaching in death and dying. Of the 99 schools that did, 30 provided one or two lectures in the first two years. Fifty-one schools taught death and dying as a module of a larger required course, and 18 schools offered an elective. Lecture was the predominant teaching method, and patient participation was usually restricted to a class presentation. Regarding the Yale seminar, each student meets individually with a patient during the semester and in small groups with the instructor to discuss the interviews, personal reactions, and professional issues in the care of his or her patient-teacher. This seminar enables students to learn the personal effects of serious illness, coping techniques used in daily living, characteristics of the caring physician, and skills needed to provide compassionate care.\r"

Of these, 73 (61%) reported that they included topics about professional liability in their educational curricula. Twenty-three of the schools indicated that students' training had been \"compromised or jeopardized\" by the impact of physicians' concerns about medicolegal issues. Forty-seven of the schools had students who had been named in malpractice suits. The study shows that undergraduate medical education has been significantly affected by issues of professional liability. Relevant medicolegal content should be an integral part of medical school education.\r"

Students were asked to indicate the degrees of influence that various factors had on their specialty choices, using a Likert-type scale ranging from \"totally unimportant\" to \"decisive.\" Compared with their peers who chose high-technology specialties, those who chose primary care were more likely to be motivated by the opportunities to provide direct patient care (p less than .001), care in an ambulatory setting (p less than .001), and continuity of care (p less than .001) and the opportunity to be involved in the psychosocial aspects of medical care (p less than .001). Those who chose high-technology specialties were more likely to be motivated by desires for a large income (p less than .001) and more prestige (p less than .005), and the opportunities for research (p less than .001), more regular hours (p less than .005), more leisure and family time (p less than .001), and a better call schedule as a resident (p less than .01). Neither student age, race, sex, marital status, and level of debt nor concern about the increasing regulation of medical practice, malpractice, health manpower reports, and the increasing numbers of elderly, chronically ill, and AIDS patients were found to be significant factors in the students' choice of primary care.\r"

Nearly 70% of the graduates' early choices remained stable, double the percentage found by other studies that based stability on an entering medical student's single choice of a career specialty. The findings suggest that students entering medical school have in mind a variety of acceptable specialties and later are likely to choose one of these as a career.\r"

The other was a four-year program devoting two years each to the basic and clinical science, but with elements unifying the two areas. Using an 18-item form, the program directors rated the performance of 42-96% of the residents who had graduated in the classes of 1982, 1984, 1985, and 1986. (1982 was the only class of the three-year curriculum that was studied.) Graduates of the three-year program showed less strength in background medical knowledge and in their experience of using research data; their greatest strengths seemed to be in the sorts of skills that normally would be acquired during the course of residency experiences. Graduates of the four-year curriculum seemed more able to integrate background medical knowledge and effective care of patients. Their weaknesses appeared to be in those skills that would be developed during the course of the residency experience. The only marked differences between the two groups in terms of residency specialty choice were in surgery and medicine.\r"

Initial specialty preference was a poor predictor of later specialty choice (R2 = .11). The students' intolerance of ambiguity was not significantly associated with either their initial medical specialty preferences or their specialty choices at graduations. This finding supports previous studies showing that specialty preferences changed dramatically during medical school, but does not reveal any support for a relationship between students' initial intolerance of ambiguity and their specialty selections.\r"

More than one-third of the first-year students admitted to Brown were from premedical postbaccalaureate programs (that is, they had taken the traditional premedical course requirements after graduating from college). The postbaccalaureate students were older than the rest of their classmates, on average, and were more likely to have been non-science majors in college. Academic performances over the first two years were comparable in the two groups, and there was no significant difference between the groups in their self-reports of adequacy of preparation or involvement in extracurricular activities. The author concludes that, faced with a smaller applicant pool, medical schools may wish to consider premedical postbaccalaureate students as a valuable resource.\r"

Although investigators welcomed the resultant increase in support stability, concerns were raised about the institute's ability to fund competing awards. A model was developed to assess alternative policies that might result in increased numbers of competing awards. Assuming that the NHLBI receives budget increases sufficient only to keep pace with inflation, the transitory effects of moving to the current policy of longer award terms should largely have passed by 1993. In the long term, the annual number of competing awards will exceed the average number funded between 1980 and 1983. To increase the annual number of competing awards over the long term would require either a reduction in the current percentage of five-year awards or an increase in the total number of active grants. A reduction in the current percentage of five-year awards would subject productive scientists to greater instability in their research support (that is, they would have to apply more frequently for grants) and would introduce greater variability in the number of competing awards available each year. A substantial increase in the total number of active NHLBI awards would be necessary to return the institute's competing awards to the levels of 1984 to 1988.\r"

The argument is made that these designs are often of limited use in clinical environments characterized by small samples and large within-group variability. The idiographic model of research design is presented as on alternative to traditional group comparison design. Idiographic, or single-subject, research emphasizes continuous monitoring of patient performance within a specified design framework. The advantages and limitations of both single-subject and group comparison designs are presented. Both designs can help establish the efficacy of rehabilitation practice and contribute to rehabilitation science.\r"

Documentation of peripheral nerve conduction revealed no abnormalities in any of the subjects. Centrally, abnormal responses to median and posterior tibial nerve stimulation were found at the spinal level and/or the scalp in nearly all MS patients. Using the latency of the initial negativity of scalp SEPs, posterior tibial SEPs were abnormal significantly more often than median SEPs. Calculations suggested a significant increase in spinal conduction time. The high incidence of abnormal SEPs does not support any substantial physiological recovery in this group of MS patients.\r"

Increased age and poor circulatory status may contribute to the increased risk of tissue injury seen in this population. This study evaluates the effects of age and circulatory status as risk factors for skin injury resulting from externally applied forces. Twelve young control (YC), six elderly control (OC) and 11 subjects with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) were studied. After base-line ankle arm index (AAI) measurements, TcPO2 electrodes were applied 10 cm below the knee over the medial surface of the tibia and the muscle belly of tibialis anterior. TcPO2 measurements and tissue displacements were obtained under the influence of incremented, normally oriented, external loads. The sensitivity of the tissues to applied loads was determined by calculating the load at which the TcPO2 reached zero. The stiffness of the tissues (displacement/load) was calculated under high (greater than 40 mm Hg) and low (less than 20 mm Hg) loading conditions. No difference was noted in tissue sensitivity to applied loads between the OC and YC populations. The TcPO2 decreased to zero in the PVD population at significantly lower applied loads than both the OC and YC populations. The tissue stiffness of the PVD and the OC populations over bone was greater than the YC population, but no significant differences were noted between the PVD and the OC populations. In summary, increased age does not result in a greater tissue sensitivity to externally applied loads, in spite of the demonstrated increased tissue stiffness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MRI revealed a syrinx extending from C2 to T12. We measured central motor conduction times (CMCTs) to the biceps, median F-wave latencies, needle electromyography and motor nerve conduction studies. Six days before surgery, CMCTs were 9.0 ms on the left and 7.8 ms on the right (normal less than 8.0), median F-waves were absent on the left and needle EMG revealed evidence of denervation in the left biceps. Fifteen days after syringopleural shunting at the T7 level, CMCTs had dropped to 6.9 ms on the left and 4.6 ms on the right; the left median F-wave reappeared with a normal latency. Repeat MRI revealed the syrinx to be smaller in diameter. These results suggest that CMCTs measured from magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex may be useful in the diagnosis of post-traumatic syringomyelia, as well as for following such patients postoperatively.\r"

This study examined the effect of an antispasticity medication on stiffness from the myotatic reflex response generated by passive sinusoidal ankle motion. A repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-subject, double-blind design was employed. The independent variable was spasticity medication treatment, where the levels were 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day of baclofen v placebo treatment. Viscous and elastic stiffness measurements were taken at the ankle joint during a placebo base-line phase and during treatment with baclofen for five adult males with traumatic spinal cord injuries. Ankle sinusoidal oscillation frequencies were from 3 to 12 Hz during test sessions. Mean viscous and elastic stiffness scores for all frequencies were calculated for each phase of the study. Randomization tests of mean changes in stiffness measurements between each treatment phase of the study failed to provide any convincing evidence of a significant treatment effect for reduction of spasticity in the traumatic spinal cord injured subjects studied. Further testing is needed to exclude potential confounding factors before this conclusion can be confirmed. The results suggest that baclofen is not a universal treatment of choice for all individuals with spasticity resulting from traumatic spinal cord injury.\r"

Abnormality was considered to be significant when the value fell outside of 2 SD of control mean values. Among 17 patients with clinical evidence of radiculopathy, needle EMG was abnormal in 10 patients (58.8%), whereas in the nerve stimulation test the abnormalities were shown in 16 patients (94.1%); in amplitude difference and the abnormal area, differences were shown in 12 patients (70.6%). Among 23 patients with only subjective symptoms of radiculopathy, needle EMG was abnormal in nine patients (39.1%), whereas the abnormal amplitude differences were shown in 18 patients (78.3%) and 15 patients (65.2%) with abnormal area difference by spinal nerve stimulation, respectively.

But there is much more to be learned than can be presented in a short series of articles. From this series, you should be able to make a reasoned choice about what role in research you would like to take, and seek to maintain or upgrade your research skills to accomplish that. The previous articles, exercises and references presented will guide you in independent study. The focus of this article is to help you choose an environment in which you can continue to learn and develop. Although the \"ideal\" place as described here may never exist, no institution is totally devoid of research possibilities and you can use this article to help seek or develop local resources you may not have considered. By extracting questions and clues from people around you, you stimulate them to \"think research\" even if a formal program is absent; at the least, you can ally yourself with a nearby institution which has researchers in other clinical specialties or areas of basic science. Each organization is obviously different, having different strengths and resources. It is up to each chairperson to decide what proportion of limited resources should be invested in research. Once this decision is made, it is the initiative of the individual faculty members that will make a productive department.\r"

A better understanding of this enzyme, and its two catalytic functions, the DNA polymerase and the RNase H, could lead to the development of new drugs that would specifically block HIV replication. The available genetic, sequence, biochemical, and immunological data on the reverse transcriptase of HIV-1 constrain the possible structure of the DNA polymerase domain. The purpose of this review is to correlate the data and to discuss, in light of that data, a model for the structure of the polymerase domain. In this model, the polymerase domain is approximately 50 to 60 A in diameter with a 20 A opening to accommodate the nucleic acid duplex. The most evolutionarily conserved region of RT (amino acids 20-190 of HIV-1 RT) is proposed to form the inner surface of the 20 A opening to which the nucleic acid hemiduplex is bound.\r"

These particles can infect a number of T-cell lines and exert a cytopathic effect on fresh human and macaque peripheral blood lymphocytes. The cloned virus is biologically and morphologically indistinguishable from its parental uncloned strain as shown by restriction enzyme analysis, electron microscopy, and kinetics of infection. However, as shown by radioimmunoprecipitation assays, the cloned virus-infected cells express a full-length gp41 protein as predicted by the nucleotide sequence, whereas the wild-type parental strain expresses a truncated gp33 protein. Both the parental strain and the cloned virus possess a deletion encompassing the end of the nef gene within the U3 region which apparently does not affect their in vitro cytopathic and replicative capacities.\r"

  ".U": "91090983\r", 
  ".W": "The nonstructural nef gene product of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), p27, is a regulatory \"early phase\" protein produced by HIV-infected cells. As a possible negative regulator of transcription, it has been suggested that p27 may be involved in the control of HIV proviral latency. Immune reactivity to p27 may result in early destruction of HIV-replicating cells before viral assembly or of latently infected cells. It appeared, thus, of interest to investigate the immunogenicity of the molecule in chimpanzees immunized against HIV antigens. Two of the six chimpanzees that were injected with soluble recombinant p27 in association with other HIV proteins, displayed significant and sustained T-helper lymphocyte proliferative responses to p27 and to the other antigens. Using a set of synthetic peptides spanning the entire p27 sequence, two T-cell epitopes could be located: one within the last 20 amino-acids of the C terminus of the molecule, the other around the region of residues 118-122. Sera from the same animals also reacted to p27 in a radioimmunoassay as well as to some of the peptides in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Sequential B-cell epitopes could thus be determined as being located in the regions of amino acids: 17-35, 52-66, and 185-205. The results obtained with peptides spanning the region between amino acid residues 65 and 172 indicate that at least two additional B-cell epitopes were present in the region comprised between amino acid 65 and 146. Interestingly, the extreme C terminus of the molecule encompasses both immunodominant T- and B-cell epitopes. Taken together, these observations should prove useful for the rational design of a HIV vaccine.\r"

Of 92 HIV-1 infected hemophiliacs, 72 (78%) produced anti-nef antibodies in this assay; the early appearance of anti-nef prior to full seroconversion was a rare event in this population, occurring in only one subject (approximately 1%). Anti-nef antibodies were not detected in any of 500 sera from 98 repeatedly HIV seronegative subjects who had been exposed to sexually transmitted modes of HIV infection (45 subjects) or through blood products (53 subjects). There was no significant association of titer or anti-nef antibody with protection from disease in HIV infection (p = 0.1). Although the nef protein is relatively immunogenic in natural infection, this study cannot confirm the previously reported high prevalence of anti-nef antibodies prior to seroconversion, nor the finding of anti-nef antibodies in HIV seronegative but exposed subjects.\r"

  ".U": "91090985\r", 
  ".W": "The human immunodeficiency virus 1 envelope glycoprotein is synthesized as a precursor, gp160, which is subsequently cleaved to generate the external gp120 and the transmembrane gp41. Both of these cleavage products are known to mediate critical functions of the virus. In order to define the best strategy for the development of a vaccine against human immunodeficiency virus 1, it could be important to map the crucial epitopes on gp160. This entire gp160 is uneasy to purify because it is readily subjected to proteolytic cleavage. Furthermore, it is anchored on the cell membrane and needs detergent treatment for purification. We thus used a recombinant gp160 which was engineered to remove the cleavage sites between gp120 and gp41 and the hydrophobic transmembrane in order to investigate the murine immune response. We selected a panel of 8 monoclonal antibodies which recognize different epitopes on the immunizing recombinant soluble gp160. The reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies was checked on virus-derived gp160, gp120, and gp41. Three antibodies reacted only with gp120 but the others were shown to react with gp41 epitopes or with discontinuous epitopes bridging gp120 and gp41. One subregion of these epitopes was located using a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of gp41. This epitope is apparently part of an immunodominant site since it is recognized by three different monoclonal antibodies. We used competitive inhibition experiments to map the epitopes on recombinant gp160; therefore, the results are probably indicative of the folding of the recombinant soluble gp160 used for immunization.\r"

The two of these five which were tested with live cells infected with the divergent HIV-1 isolates IIIB, MN, and RF were specifically reactive by fluorescence analyses with cells infected with the MN and IIIB isolates. Four of the five monoclonal antibodies blocked the fusion of IIIB-infected cells with uninfected MOLT-4 target cells. The monoclonal antibody most reactive with MN-infected cells by fluorescence, #5025A, blocked the fusion of MN-infected cells with uninfected MOLT-4 cells. Four of the five monoclonal antibodies neutralized the IIIB isolate of HIV-1 in vitro, but none neutralized the MN or RF isolates at the levels of antibody tested (less than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Taken together these data indicate that monoclonal antibodies to the immunodominant neutralizing domain of HIV-1 gp120 display different levels of group reactivity depending on the assay system being examined.\r"

We found that Evans blue and aurin tricarboxylic acid could completely inhibit binding of anti-CD4 (Leu3a) and rgp120 and have selectivity for the CD4 receptor. A number of other compounds, including dextran sulfate and heparin had no effect on binding of rgp120 and were shown to be nonspecific for inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to different T-cell receptors. Studies using a number of membrane-active drugs showed that changes in membrane potential or ion fluxes were not involved in the inhibition of binding of rgp120 by Evans blue or aurin tricarboxylic acid.\r"

  ".W": "We have used interactive laser cytometry to investigate the expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoproteins gp160, gp41, gp120, and the core protein p24 in the HIV-infected human lymphocyte cell lines H-9, CEM-SS, and C8166. This method allowed for the ultrasensitive detection of fluorescence signals at the single cell level and, when combined with specific anti-HIV antibodies, permitted unique quantitative detection of HIV antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence assays with monoclonal antibodies directed against gp120 revealed that a large proportion of lymphocytic cells expressed increased gp120-associated fluorescence consistent with HTLV-IIIRF infection. Certain monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were also effective in quantifying gp160, gp41, and p24 expression. Expression of these antigens was found to vary significantly within 48 h. Significant loss (greater than or equal to 50%) of gp120 expression was observed when cells were treated with 1.0 microM AZT. The expression of the HIV-associated protein markers gp160, gp41, and p24 was detectable 24 h after infection of C8166, a cord blood lymphocytic cell line. C8166 cells expressed an additional 6- to 10-fold increase in gp120 in 48 h as well as a 3- to 4-fold increase in gp160, gp41, and p24. AZT (0.01 and 0.1 microM) decreased the expression of gp120, gp160, and p24 in a dose-dependent fashion. This new application of interactive laser cytometry permits early, sensitive, and statistically based distinctions in the expression of HIV-associated antigens in infected target cells at the single-cell level, and allows detection of important changes in HIV-associated antigen expression and the kinectics thereof.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of excess (greater than or equal to 30 microM) guanosine, deoxyguanosine, or 8-aminoguanosine had no effect on the anti-HIV activity of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine. In [8-3H]2',3'-dideoxyguanosine-exposed cells, the intracellular radioactivity was twofold higher than the extracellular. When guanosine, deoxyguanosine, or 8-aminoguanosine was preincubated or added simultaneously to 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine, uptake of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine was reduced by 28 to 34%, whereas addition of p-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (20 microM) had no effect. In metabolism studies using H-9 cells, dideoxyguanosine triphosphate could not be detected despite a 24-h incubation of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine at effective anti-HIV concentrations. The addition of excess (greater than or equal to 30 microM) guanosine, deoxyguanosine, and 8-aminoguanosine, while inhibiting the catabolism of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine, did not enhance the anabolic conversion of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine to dideoxyguanosine triphosphate. Our failure to detect the formation of dideoxyguanosine triphosphate and the lack of reversal of antiviral effects by natural purine nucleosides raises questions on the role of this metabolite in the anti-HIV activity of 2',3'-dideoxyguanosine.\r"

  ".W": "An anaesthetic technique using high frequency jet ventilation has been proposed for direct laryngoscopy, but this may expose the patients to the risk of barotrauma. In order to assess this risk, we have measured end-expiratory airway pressure (EEP) through the injector using two three-way solenoid valves mounted in series. At the end of insufflation the first valve was switched off and the apparatus deadspace connected to atmosphere through a large exit port during an adjustable time (decompression time). Then the second valve was switched off and the injection line connected to a transducer, allowing measurement of EEP through the injector. The accuracy of this measurement was tested against airway pressure measured directly in the trachea (Pt) in a lung model. Provided that the decompression time was long enough (70 ms) and the apparatus deadspace was small (6 ml), the difference between EEP and Pt was less than 1 cm H2O for frequencies up to 5 Hz. A clinical evaluation was performed in 64 patients under general anaesthesia before laryngoscopy. EEP correlated with end-expiratory pulmonary volume above apnoeic FRC inferred from abdominal and thoracic displacements. At jet frequencies up to 5 Hz, the correlations between these two variables were satisfactory (r greater than 0.88), suggesting that EEP is a good indicator of pulmonary overdistension.\r"

In 11 satisfactory recordings, the tongue movement was inconsistent in direction and not more than 8 mm in the anterior tongue and 6 mm in the posterior tongue.

The patients were allocated randomly to one of four groups according to the end-tidal concentration of volatile anaesthetic: 1 MAC isoflurane, 1 MAC enflurane, 1.8 MAC isoflurane and 1.8 MAC enflurane. The lungs were ventilated with an air-oxygen mixture. Neuromuscular block was produced with pancuronium. Room temperature and i.v. fluid administration were standardized. Aural canal, muscle and mean skin temperatures decreased significantly in all groups during surgery (P less than 0.001). The decrease in core and muscle temperatures, and mean body heat was significantly greater in the 1.8 MAC groups than in the 1 MAC groups for both volatile agents (P less than 0.001). However, there was a significantly greater decrease in core temperature and mean body heat in the isoflurane compared with the enflurane group (P less than 0.026). Body temperature returned to preoperative values during the recovery period. There was a significantly greater rate of rewarming during the first 1 h of recovery in the 1.8 MAC groups compared with the 1 MAC equivalent (P less than 0.001), and this was independent of the volatile agent used. The present results are compared with those reported previously in which nitrous oxide was added to the volatile agents. The decrease in body temperature depends upon the concentration of vapour used. However, it appears that isoflurane, without nitrous oxide, caused greater loss of body heat than enflurane.\r"

The pharmacokinetic values for propofol were described by a three-compartment mammillary model with rapid distribution phases (T1/2 alpha mean (SEM) 3.1 (2.0) min and T1/2 beta 44 (9.1) min) and a slower final phase of T1/2 gamma 520 (96) min. The clearance of propofol was rapid (mean 1.6 (0.24) litre min-1). Propofol was distributed initially into a relatively large central compartment (mean 23.7 (6.6) litre) and was extensively redistributed (mean Vss 593 (157) litre). There was no difference in the pharmacokinetic profile of propofol between the two groups.\r"

The incidence of postspinal headache was 7.5%, and 11.3% of patients developed back pain. One patient remained in hospital because of hypotension and dizziness.

An i.v. infusion of pipecuronium was controlled to maintain a constant 90-95% twitch depression throughout the investigation. The right sciatic nerve was stimulated continuously with supramaximal stimuli at 0.1 Hz and the force of the corresponding evoked isometric muscle contraction was recorded continuously. Control pigs needed an infusion rate of pipecuronium 8-10.7 micrograms kg-1 min-1. In the renal group, it was necessary to reduce the infusion rate of pipe-curonium by about 25% after clamping both renal vascular pedicles (P less than 0.05 compared with controls); in pigs undergoing liver transplantation, it was necessary to reduce the rate by approximately 80% after clamping hepatic vessels (P less than 0.05 compared with controls and from the period after clamping of renal vessels). After hepatic recirculation, the infusion rate of pipecuronium was increased progressively to a rate which corresponded to 50% of baseline values (P less than 0.05 compared with the anhepatic phase and from controls). Plasma concentrations of pipecuronium were comparable in the three animal groups and did not change significantly during the study. These data suggest that the liver plays a more important role than the kidney in the plasma clearance of pipecuronium in pigs.\r"

Plasma and epicardial concentrations of K+ were measured, in the latter case with an ion-selective electrode. Adrenaline 10 micrograms kg-1 caused a rapid increase in the plasma concentration of K+ from 4.2 to 5.9 mmol litre-1. The magnitude and the time course of epicardial concentration of K+ were similar. Alpha-adrenoceptor block with either phentolamine 5 mg kg-1 (non-selective block) or prazosin 0.1 mg kg-1 (selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor block) abolished the hyperkalaemic effect of adrenaline in the plasma and on the epicardium. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine increased the K+ concentration, but the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14.304 did not cause any change in concentration. These results suggest that the hyperkalaemia induced by adrenaline occurs in the interstitial fluid of the myocardium and is mediated by alpha 1-adrenoceptors. These findings may be important in patients at risk of hyperkalaemia, with implications, for example, in the use of suxamethonium during induction of anaesthesia.\r"

The view obtained was better than recorded previously during general anaesthesia in two patients, and in a third the x-ray showed that positioning the blade tip beneath the epiglottis would have improved vision, suggesting that reproducibility of the assessment may not be consistent. The \"ease of intubation\" and \"complementary\" angles may be helpful in the assessment of such patients. A \"peardrop\" effect is described whereby during laryngoscopy, the epiglottis became pressed against the posterior pharyngeal wall as a result of tongue compression. In the absence of muscle paralysis, removal of the blade caused immediate correction. However, during anaesthesia with neuromuscular block it is suggested that this not only occurs more readily but, may not correct when the blade is removed. Iatrogenic airway obstruction during moderately difficult tracheal intubation may be common and should be anticipated.\r"

An angular measure of jaw protrusion from a line joining the upper incisors and a point just above and anterior to the vocal cords, to the mid-point on the inner surface of the mandible was useful: the lower angle of this triangle was as important as the angle at the incisors.\r"

Infants received suxamethonium 2, 3 or 4 mg kg-1; children received 1 or 2 mg kg-1. The increase in muscle tone during onset of neuromuscular block was independent of dose. Onset of block was faster in children who received suxamethonium 2 mg kg-1 compared with those who received 1 mg kg-1, and in infants given 2 mg kg-1 than in children given the same dose. Compared with adults given suxamethonium 1 mg kg-1, infants required 3-4 mg kg-1 and children at least 2 mg kg-1 to produce 6-8 min of neuromuscular block. These results provide a clear indication for increasing the intubating doses of suxamethonium in infants and children, and a explanation for the unduly high rate of \"masseter spasm\" in some paediatric centres.\r"

The response of BRP showed two distinct patterns. BRP was reduced by an average of 3.3 mm Hg (P = 0.005). Mean arterial pressure was reduced in all patients by an average maximum of 28.3 mm Hg (P = less than 0.001), which caused a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) by 22.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that, by reducing BRP, propofol provided suitable conditions for intracranial surgery, but care should be taken to avoid excessive reduction in CPP.\r"

When 200 mg of erythromycin had been infused, the patient lost consciousness, but other vital functions remained normal. After 45 min, he awakened spontaneously. At the time the plasma concentration of midazolam was 134 ng ml-1. In order to investigate possible interactions between midazolam and erythromycin, we studied the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in six children of the same age undergoing minor otolaryngological surgery. The plasma concentration of midazolam in the patient who lost consciousness was significantly greater than in six other children without concomitant administration of erythromycin. The altered pharmacokinetics of midazolam may result from reduced hepatic clearance of midazolam caused by an enzyme inhibiting drug, erythromycin.\r"

A panel of monoclonal antibodies against a number of cytokeratins and differentiation markers were used in the PAP technique to analyse the cells. Cryostat sections taken from the donor skin samples were stained simultaneously. Foetal skin expressed the cytokeratins 7, 13 and 19 that were not observed postnatally. This cytokeratin expression as maintained in both culture conditions and also observe in paediatric and adult keratinocytes. Cytokeratin 7 was expressed on a greater proportion of foetal cells than in vivo, whereas the expression of 13 and 19 decreased. All keratinocytes expressed vimentin, transferrin receptor and Ki67 (proliferating cell antigen), while a small proportion expressed involucrin throughout culture, indicating their high level of differentiation and proliferation. No differences were observed between low and high density cultures. Foetal keratinocytes cultured in MCDB 153 did not reach confluence and stronger staining of differentiation markers was observed in these cells. These results show that the in vivo differences in cytokeratin expression of foetal and adult keratinocytes disappear in the culture.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the clinical, immunological and serological features of patients with silica-associated systemic sclerosis are different from patients with the 'idiopathic' form of systemic sclerosis (SS) we studied 22 underground coal miners who were exposed to silica dust (SD), 30 mine workers who later developed silicosis (S) and 17 mine workers exposed to silica dust who subsequently developed a systemic sclerosis-like disease (SA-SS). The patients with SA-SS had features clinically indistinguishable from individual patients with SS. They all had Raynaud's phenomenon, 14 had cutaneous sclerosis identical to that seen in acrosclerosis and three had a generalized cutaneous sclerosis. Sixteen patients had bibasilar pulmonary fibrosis, 10 had necrosis of the fingertip pulps, nine had oesophageal involvement and only one patient had renal involvement. Antinuclear antibodies and circulating immune complexes were detected in three and eight patients with SD, 14 and five patients with S and in 16 and nine patients with SA-SS, respectively. Anti-Scl-70 antibody was detected in eight of the 17 patients with SA-SS. Evidence for in vivo endothelial cell damage, as determined by elevated levels of von Willebrand factor, was found in nine patients with SD, 14 patients with S and in 10 patients with SA-SS. Following incubation of the patient's serum with confluent cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells there was only a significant reduction in calcium ionophore-induced release of prostacyclin with the serum from SA-SS patients compared to that with control serum (NC). The mean +/- SEM release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of prostacyclin expressed as ng/10(4) cells) decreased from 2.90 +/- 0.27 to 2.01 +/- 0.33 (SD), 3.34 +/- 0.42 to 1.76 +/- 0.31 (S), 1.98 +/- 0.12 to 0.64 +/- 0.07 (SA-SS) and 2.28 +/- 0.33 to 1.36 +/- 0.21 (NC) with 1 and 20% serum, respectively. This study demonstrates that immune complex and antinuclear antibody formation and in vivo endothelial cell damage occurs following occupational exposure to silica. The patients who subsequently develop a systemic sclerosis-like disease have clinical, immunological and serological features which are indistinguishable from the idiopathic form of the disease although as a group the SA-SS patients have a higher prevalence of pulmonary involvement and the anti-Scl-70 antibody.\r"

Antikeratin antibodies were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in 5.9-9.5% of the culture supernatants of fused spleen cells taken from naive mice. When mice were immunized with keratins, the number of supernatants containing antikeratin antibodies was increased to eight out of 51 (15.7%). When immunized with non-keratin materials such as activated human T cells, adult T-cell leukaemia cell lysates, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I), 16.7-20.8% of the supernatants were found to contain antikeratin antibodies by ELISA. The antikeratin antibodies in the supernatants showed cytoplasmic staining of keratinocytes in human as well as mouse skin by indirect immunofluorescence. The antibodies reacted with extracted human epidermal keratins by dot-blot and Western blot analysis. Most antikeratin antibodies in the supernatants did not show cross-reactivity with exogenous antigens used for immunization and vimentin-type intermediate-sized filaments. These findings demonstrate that B cells producing antikeratin antibodies are common in naive mice, and produce various types of antikeratin antibodies following specific activation with epidermal keratins and non-specific immunological stimuli.\r"

The aim was to assess changes in referral patterns and workload compared with the findings of an identical investigation undertaken in November 1981. Of particular interest were the possible effects of recent publicity campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness about skin cancer. The medical complement of the dermatology department had changed minimally since 1981 and the population increase in the south-east of Scotland over the same period was 1.5%. During November 1988 1592 new patients and 2037 review patients were seen. This represented an increase of 29.2% and 28.3%, respectively, since 1981. The most striking changes in diagnostic groups were a 173% rise in new cases presenting with benign tumours (excluding viral warts) and a 106% increase in new patients with malignant tumours. Viral warts and eczema were, as in 1981, the second and third most common diagnostic categories amongst new patients. There was a 98% increase in the number of surgical procedures performed on new patients compared with 1981. We conclude that the substantial increase in numbers of both benign and malignant tumours and the consequent doubling in surgical treatments was due to increased public awareness and concern about skin cancer.\r"

Psychosocial factors are more severely impaired than physical activities in patients with psoriasis. It is now possible to directly compare the disability experienced by psoriatic patients with that experienced by patients suffering from other systemic diseases, using the SIP. The PDI is an appropriate method to give a rapid overall measure of psoriasis disability.\r"

These patients were compared with age- and sex-matched but otherwise unselected general dermatology out-patients. Using the Beck depression inventory, significantly more patients with generalized pruritus (32.4%) had depressive symptomatology (score greater than 14) than controls (13.2%, P less than 0.05). Although more patients with chronic urticaria had depressive symptomatology (14.7%) than controls (4.4%), the difference was not statistically significant. Using the Speilberger state-trait anxiety inventory there were no significant differences between the patients with pruritus or urticaria and their controls with respect to state or trait anxiety scores above the upper 90% probability limit for the general population. Thus, significant depression may be expected in a substantial proportion of patients with idiopathic generalized pruritus but in a relatively small proportion of those with chronic urticaria.\r"

In addition, the possible role that cytokines may play in HTR has not been investigated. We show that interleukin-8 (IL-8), a cytokine with chemotactic and neutrophil-activation properties, is produced in whole blood following addition of ABO-incompatible red blood cells, in a dose- and time-dependent manner related to the degree of hemolysis, and is inhibited by inactivation of complement. IL-8 production is accompanied by increased gene expression in the buffy coat. This observation has implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of and for the treatment of HTR.\r"

This terminal differentiation step is also observed in vitro when blood MO are cultured in the presence of serum. Yet, the inducing signals present in serum are not defined. We have established primary cultures from elutriation-purified blood MO and found that the active metabolite of vitamin D3 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) could induce maturation of MO to macrophages (MAC) in the absence of any serum proteins. Cells were cultured for 7 days with AB-group serum or 1,25(OH)2D3, respectively, and MO maturation analyzed by morphology, functional activity, and the expression of lineage-restricted maturation-associated antigens (MAX.1, MAX.3). At an optimal concentration of 10(-8) mol/L, 1,25(OH)2D3 promoted the development of fully differentiated MAC whose phenotype and functional competence in terms of cytokine release (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, fibronectin, and lysozyme) was comparable with MAC grown in serum. In conclusion, our data may add to the immunoregulatory potential of 1,25(OH)2D3, which may play an essential role in the ontogeny of the mononuclear phagocyte system.\r"

In contrast, TGF beta added to the culture inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner, the induction of IL-6 by IL-1 at the level of messenger RNA and bioactivity.

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of the hematologic abnormalities commonly observed in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is incompletely understood. We report here that in vitro growth of myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) progenitor cells from six patients with AIDS was not significantly different from that of normal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seronegative donors: 25.3 +/- 5 CFU-GM per 5 x 10(4) low density marrow cells and 33.5 +/- 5 BFU-E were observed in AIDS patients versus 32.7 +/- 5 CFU-GM and 42.1 +/- 5 BFU-E in controls. Furthermore, no HIV-DNA in individual colonies (CFU-GM and BFU-E) could be detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, although HIV-1 DNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the same patients. Similarly, normal bone marrow cells exposed in vitro to different isolates of HIV or recombinant purified HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (gp) 120 did not exhibit any difference in growth of CFU-GM or BFU-E as compared with mock exposed bone marrow cells. HIV-1 DNA could not be detected by the PCR technique in individual colonies derived from HIV exposed marrow. This study suggests that committed myeloid and erythroid progenitors from AIDS patients are responsive to hematopoietic growth factors in vitro and do not appear to contain HIV-1 DNA. Also, HIV or its envelope gp did not alter the growth of hematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro. No evidence of HIV infection of progenitor cells could be demonstrated. Impaired hematopoiesis in patients with AIDS may not be related to direct effects of HIV on committed progenitor cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have used three-color flow cytometry to investigate the pattern of expression of the CD11/CD18, CD44, and leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (LAM-1) adhesion molecules during myeloid and erythroid differentiation in humans. The earliest myeloid cells, identified as CD33loCD15-, were exclusively CD44hi but contained both leukocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1hi) and LFA-1lo cells, as well as LAM-1+ and LAM-1- cells. This CD33loCD15- myeloid subpopulation expressed only low levels of CD11c and failed to express CD11b, CD14, or any lymphoid (CD3, CD16, CD19) antigens or glycophorin. Commitment to monocyte differentiation, suggested by the presence of an LFA-1hi CD11c+ subset within the CD33loCD15- subpopulation, was clearly signaled by upregulation of CD33; these monocyte-lineage committed cells were exclusively CD33hi, CD44hi, CD11ahi, CD11c+, and exhibited a broad range of intensity of CD15 expression. Later stages of monopoiesis were identified by acquisition of CD11b, and subsequently of CD14. Myeloid cells committed to granulopoiesis remained LFA-1lo, and underwent a sharp upregulation of CD15 along with downregulation of both CD33 and CD44. Successive stages of granulocyte development were marked by expression of CD11b and, subsequently, of CD16. The earliest cells capable of erythroid differentiation were CD44hi, LFA-1lo, and LAM-1+. Both LFA-1 and LAM-1 were lost before the onset of glycophorin (glyco) expression, whereas CD44 expression remained high on glyco+ cells, which also expressed CD45. CD44 expression was intermediate on glyco+ CD71+ cells, and low on glyco+ CD45- CD71- cells, similar to normal, circulating erythrocytes. Our results allow us to phenotypically define discrete stages in the normal development of monocytes, neutrophils, and erythrocytes. The expression of LFA-1, LAM-1, and high levels of CD44 on the most primitive hematopoietic cells detectable by flow cytometry suggests that at least some of these molecules are critically involved in leukocyte adhesion during development.\r"

  ".W": "We administered recombinant human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), the common mediator of inflammation process, to C57B1/6 male mice (0.5 microgram, every 12 hours over five times) intraperitoneally and consequently induced a remarkable thrombocytosis. Day 1 was designated as the following day of the last injection in the morning. A significant thrombocytosis was observed on days 1 through 5 with a peak on day 2 (162 +/- 9 x 10(4)/mm3) compared with the control mice injected with heated IL-1 beta (101 +/- 11 x 10(4)/mm3). A striking increase in mean size of marrow megakaryocytes was noted on days 1 and 2. The incorporation of 75Se-selenomethionine into circulating platelets as a measure of platelet production was about 2.3 times higher in IL-1 beta-treated mice than in control mice. To determine which factor(s) is responsible for elicited thrombocytosis, the in vitro studies and bioassays for several hematopoietic factors were performed. IL-1 beta by itself did not stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro, suggesting that the thrombocytosis is attributed to other factor(s) via IL-1 beta stimulation. Serum colony-stimulating factor (CSF) activity after a single IL-1 beta (0.5 microgram) injection, monitored by colony assay with 10% tested serum, peaked at 3 hours. Formed colonies were mostly granulocyte (G) and granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-types, and studies using rabbit anti-mouse GM-CSF serum or using human marrow as target cells showed that the CSF activity of the tested serum consisted of, at least, GM-CSF and G-CSF. Addition of IL-3 concomitantly with the tested serum gave rise to a greater number of megakaryocytic colonies. Serum IL-3, monitored by IL-3-dependent cell line 32D clone 5, and erythropoietin activities were not detected at serum level in IL-1 beta-treated mice. Serum IL-6 assay by IL-6-dependent mouse hybridoma cell line MH-60.BSF2 showed high levels of the tested serum with a peak at 2.5 hours with no detection at 10 hours after the injection. Heated IL-1 beta caused an increase of neither IL-6 nor CSF activities. Our data suggest that the thrombocytosis induced by IL-1 beta is mediated by IL-6 or a combination of IL-6 and other cytokine(s), and that IL-6 may play a regulatory role in platelet production in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody, OKM5, recognizes an 88-Kd monocyte membrane protein and also binds to the platelet membrane protein, GPIV (GPIIIb, CD36). In this study, we have found that the OKM5 target epitope is present at approximately 12,000 copies per platelet and that interaction with the antibody has both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on platelet function. In the absence of other stimuli, OKM5 induced platelet aggregation, secretion, and expression of fibrinogen receptors. These stimulatory responses required intact antibody as F(ab')2 fragments were not active but blocked the stimulatory activity of the intact antibody. In contrast, exposure of platelets to OKM5 followed by another strong stimulus such as thrombin resulted in a marked suppression of fibrinogen, fibronectin, and von Willebrand factor binding to the cells. This effect was not noted when a weak stimulus, adenosine diphosphate, was the second agonist. At OKM5 concentrations that interfered with fibrinogen binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets by 80% to 90%, platelet binding of exogenous thrombospondin, or surface expression of endogenous thrombospondin was not affected. The inhibitory effect of OKM5 on fibrinogen binding to thrombin-stimulated platelets was related to the formation of massive platelet aggregates in the samples. These results show that interaction of OKM5 with its target antigen on platelets can elicit diverse functional responses from the cells.\r"

  ".U": "91091490\r", 
  ".W": "Although calpain (the Ca2(+)-dependent protease) is widely distributed, its function is poorly understood. One cell in which it becomes activated as a consequence of activation of the cell is the blood platelet. The aim of the present study was to determine whether activation of calpain was responsible for any of the responses of platelets to stimulation. Platelets were incubated with calpeptin, a membrane-penetrating inhibitor of calpain, before being exposed to an agonist. Concentrations of calpeptin that totally inhibited the agonist-induced hydrolysis of actin-binding protein (ABP) by calpain had no effect on many other responses associated with platelet activation: phosphorylation of myosin light chain, phosphorylation of P47, platelet shape change, aggregation of platelets, secretion of granule contents, or retraction of fibrin clots. However, these concentrations of inhibitor decreased the agonist-induced generation of procoagulant activity (assayed as the ability of platelets to catalyze the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of factor Va and factor Xa). When thrombin was the agonist, the amount of ABP that was hydrolyzed was small; only a small component of the total agonist-induced procoagulant activity was inhibited by calpeptin. When collagen was the agonist, more ABP was hydrolyzed and the amount of procoagulant activity generated was greater; calpeptin decreased the collagen-induced procoagulant activity to levels comparable with those induced by thrombin in the presence of the inhibitor. We suggest that there are at least two mechanisms by which procoagulant activity is generated on activated platelets and that the agonist-induced activation of calpain mediates one of these mechanisms. These results show that activation of calpain is a component of the stimulus-response pathway in platelets.\r"

The remaining 60% of protein S is complexed to C4b-binding protein and is functionally inactive. A family with hereditary C4b binding protein deficiency has been identified with C4b-binding protein levels in an affected father and daughter of 37 micrograms/mL and 23 micrograms/mL, respectively; these values are significantly below the normal range for this protein of 180 micrograms/mL +/- 44 micrograms/mL (mean +/- 2 SD). The total protein S (free + bound) is normal in these individuals (23.2 micrograms/mL and 17.8 micrograms/mL, respectively; normal 19.1 micrograms/mL +/- 6.0 micrograms/mL). The free protein S levels are markedly increased at 22.5 micrograms/mL and 17.4 micrograms/mL, respectively (normal 5.9 micrograms/mL +/- 2.4 micrograms/mL). This experiment of nature shows that total protein S levels in plasma are not affected by the absence of C4b-binding protein and that chronic elevation of free protein S is not associated with increased hemorrhagic tendencies.\r"

  ".W": "von Willebrand factor (vWF) is a multimeric adhesive glycoprotein essential for normal hemostasis. We have discovered that cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells incorporate inorganic sulfate into vWF. Following immunoisolation and analysis by polyacrylamide or agarose gel electrophoresis, metabolically labeled vWF was found to have incorporated [35S]-sulfate into all secreted multimer species. The time course of incorporation shows that sulfation occurs late in the biosynthesis of vWF, near the point at which multimerization occurs. Quantitative analysis suggests the presence, on average, of one molecule of sulfate per mature vWF subunit. Virtually all the detectable sulfate is released from the mature vWF subunit by treatment with endoglycosidases that remove asparagine-linked carbohydrates. Sulfated carbohydrate was localized first to the N-terminal half of the mature subunit (amino acids 1 through 1,365) by partial proteolytic digestion with protease V8; and subsequently to a smaller fragment within this region (amino acids 273 through 511) by sequential digestions with protease V8 and trypsin. Thus, the carbohydrate at asparagine 384 and/or 468 appears to be the site of sulfate modification. Sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate-sulfurylase, blocks sulfation of vWF without affecting either the ability of vWF to assemble into high molecular weight multimers or the ability of vWF multimers to enter Weible-Palade bodies. The stability of vWF multimers in the presence of an endothelial cell monolayer also was unaffected by the sulfation state. Additionally, we have found that the cleaved propeptide of vWF is sulfated on asparagine-linked carbohydrate.\r"

Although the reasons for thrombogenicity are not completely understood, several manufacturers have developed purified factor IX concentrates that contain negligible amounts of the other vitamin K-dependent factors. To evaluate whether or not the infusion of such a factor IX concentrate is followed by lesser activation of the hemostatic system than by the infusion of a PCC, we performed a series of coagulation assays on 11 hemophilia B patients before and after the administration of these two types of concentrate using a randomized cross-over design. The levels of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, a sensitive measure of the in vivo cleavage of prothrombin by factor Xa, was significantly increased in plasma after PCC, but not after factor IX concentrate. Plasma fibrinopeptide A, a sensitive index of the enzymatic activity of thrombin on fibrinogen, also increased significantly after PCC but not after factor IX concentrate. The fragment B beta 15-42, a sensitive index of the enzymatic action of plasmin on fibrin II, did not change after either concentrate. There were also no differences in less sensitive coagulation measurements, such as plasma fibrinogen, antithrombin III, and fibrin monomers, nor in indices of platelet activation, such as beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4. These findings show that the infusion of a purified factor IX concentrate can result in substantially less activation of the coagulation cascade than may be seen with PCC.\r"

  ".W": "Human protein S (HPS), a regulator of hemostasis, is a vitamin K-dependent plasma protein with potential clinical utility. We have obtained high-level expression of the cDNA for HPS in two mammalian cell lines. Both cell lines secreted single chain recombinant HPS (rHPS) in serum-free medium as determined by Western blot analysis. The ability of the rHPS from both cell lines to act as a cofactor for human protein C (HPC) was determined; the rHPS secreted from the human 293 cell line had an activity six times that of the rHPS from the AV12-664 Syrian hamster cell line. Furthermore, the relative specific cofactor activity of rHPS from the 293 cell line was actually 2.5-fold higher than that of single-chain human plasma-derived HPS. Essentially all of the rHPS secreted from the 293 cell line exhibited a calcium-dependent elution profile on anion exchange chromatography, whereas only 25% to 35% of the hamster cell-derived rHPS exhibited this profile. However, the calcium-eluted rHPS from the AV12 cell line had a high specific cofactor activity, equivalent to that of the 293-derived rHPS. A NaCl-elutable rHPS fraction (calcium nondependent) was isolated from the recombinant AV12-664 cell line, further purified, and found to have reduced activity, only 40% that of the calcium-dependent rHPS. The only observable difference in the calcium-dependent and nondependent rHPS molecules was in the content of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla); the calcium-dependent material contained approximately 10 mol Gla/mol protein whereas the calcium-nondependent material contained only approximately 8 mol Gla/mol of protein. In addition, the calcium-nondependent rHPS had reduced ability to interact with phospholipid vesicles as evidenced by an eightfold increase in the apparent kd. Our data demonstrate the isolation of rHPS with high specific activity, and show that a reduction in as few as two Gla residues dramatically decreases its functional cofactor activity for HPC, due to a reduction in ability to interact with the phospholipid bilayer.\r"

These patients, who presented with bleeding disorders due to deficiency of the vitamin K-dependent blood clotting proteins, were refractory to vitamin K1 at standard doses and required fresh frozen plasma to control bleeding until large doses of vitamin K1 were used. Metabolic studies demonstrated a blockade in vitamin K utilization, consistent with the presence of a vitamin K antagonist, but the patients denied use of anticoagulants. Warfarin assays were negative. We show that the factitious purpura in each patient was due to the surreptitious ingestion of brodifacoum, a potent second generation long-acting vitamin K antagonist used as a rodenticide. The coagulopathies responded to long-term therapy with large doses of vitamin K1. The serum elimination half-time for brodifacoum ranged from 16 to 36 days in these patients. The anticoagulant effect is of long duration, requiring chronic vitamin K treatment. With increasing availability of new rodenticides, factitious purpura due to surreptitious ingestion of these potent vitamin K antagonists is emerging as a new problem, previously associated with warfarin, with important implications for diagnosis and treatment.\r"

Precursors of the myelomonocytic pathway, represented by leukemic cells isolated from several cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in its stable and blastic phase and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), are devoid of LAP transcript. These data support the notion that LAP is a marker of the granulocyte terminal differentiation. Despite the absence of LAP mRNA in both the myeloid and the lymphoid precursors, nuclear run-on experiments show constitutive transcription of the LAP gene in leukemic cells obtained from AML, CML, as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In CML and in chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia (CMML) PMNs, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) specifically accumulates LAP mRNA without showing a substantial increase in the rate of transcription of the LAP gene. Once increased by G-CSF, LAP mRNA is very stable, showing a half-life of more than 4 hours in the presence of actinomycin-D. G-CSF is suggested to play a pivotal role in the modulation of LAP transcript in PMNs.\r"

Antibodies against purified human erythrocyte CD59 (polyclonal anti-CD59 and monoclonal antibodies [MoAbs] 1F1 and 1F5) were found to bind specifically to monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and by Western blotting to recognize an 18- to 21-Kd endothelial protein. When bound to the endothelial monolayer, anti-CD59 (immunoglobulin G or Fab fragment) potentiated membrane pore formation induced upon C9 binding to C5b-8, and augmented the C5b-9-induced cellular responses, including stimulated secretion of von Willebrand factor and expression of catalytic surface for the prothrombinase enzyme complex. Although potentiating endothelial responses to the terminal complement proteins, anti-CD59 had no effect on the response of these cells to stimulation by histamine. Taken together, these data suggest that human endothelial cells express the CD59 cell surface inhibitor of the terminal complement proteins, which serves to protect these cells from pore-forming and cell-stimulatory effects of the C5b-9 complex. These data also suggest that the inactivation or deletion of this cell surface regulatory molecule would increase the likelihood for procoagulant changes in endothelium exposed to complement activation in plasma.\r"

We asked if oxidant-mediated ATP depletion, alone, accounted for the effects of oxidants on endothelial permeability to macromolecules. When porcine pulmonary artery endothelial cells were exposed to 2.5 mmol/LH2O2, ATP was depleted to 31.7% +/- 1.8% of control within 15 minutes and was reduced to 23.1% +/- 2.0% of control after 30 minutes. To determine if this magnitude of ATP depletion could account for the oxidant-induced increase in endothelial permeability to macromolecules, we measured ATP in endothelial cells exposed to metabolic inhibitors of ATP production. We then measured the effects of these metabolic inhibitors on endothelial monolayer permeability to macromolecules. ATP levels were reduced to 44% +/- 4% of control by 12 mmol/L deoxyglucose (DOG) in the absence of glucose and to 2% +/- 1.3% of control by DOG with 25 nmol/L antimycin A in the absence of glucose. Reduction of endothelial cell ATP to these levels with the metabolic inhibitors did not alter the flux of albumin or dextran across the endothelial monolayers. Thus ATP depletion, by itself, does not explain oxidant-induced changes in endothelial permeability to macromolecules.\r"

Evidence that the 16-Kd cell surface protein Leu-13 mediates an antiproliferative signal in T lymphocytes and is IFN-inducible in endothelial cells prompted us to examine the expression and functional role of this molecule in leukemic B cells. Leu-13 density, determined by flow cytometry, was upregulated in vitro and in vivo by IFN-alpha on malignant B cells from patients with HCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal anti-Leu-13 triggered homotypic aggregation of leukemic B cells via an adhesion pathway that was not inhibited by antibodies to leukocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Moreover, anti-Leu-13 potentiated the inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha on BCGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, assessed by [3H]-thymidine and [3H]-deoxyadenosine incorporation into DNA. These results indicate that Leu-13 is part of a novel IFN-inducible signaling pathway which may modify the growth and adhesive properties of leukemic B cells under physiologic or therapeutic conditions.\r"

In 17 patients with proliferating myeloma cells in vivo, recombinant GM-CSF significantly increased the endogenous-IL-6-mediated spontaneous myeloma cell proliferation occurring in 5-day cultures of tumor cells in vitro (P less than .01). Furthermore, GM-CSF was detected in 5-day culture supernatants of myeloma bone marrow cells. This endogenous GM-CSF was produced by the myeloma bone marrow microenvironment but not by myeloma cells and contributed to the spontaneous myeloma-cell proliferation observed in 5-day cultures. In fact, this proliferation was partially blocked (67%) by anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies. The stimulatory effect of rGM-CSF was mediated through IL-6 because it was abrogated by anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibodies. rGM-CSF did not reproducibly increase the endogenous IL-6 production in short-term cultures of bone marrow cells of MM patients. Using an IL-6-dependent myeloma cell line (XG-1 cell line), rGM-CSF was shown to act directly on myeloma cells stimulating by twofold their IL-6 responsiveness. rGM-CSF did not induce any IL-6 production in XG-1 cells, nor was it able to sustain their growth alone. Although no detectable GM-CSF levels were found in the peripheral or bone marrow blood of MM patients, it is possible that GM-CSF, produced locally by the tumoral environment, enhances the IL-6 responsiveness of myeloma cells in vivo in a way similar to that reported here in vitro.\r"

FMLP elicited a two-phase response consisting of a rapid increase in cell stiffness, which peaked between 2 and 3 minutes, followed by a partial recovery of deformability to a level significantly above that of control after 5 minutes. The mechanical changes closely followed changes in F-actin content, although the peak in cell stiffness appeared to lag the F-actin response. Treatment with 3 mumols/L CTB produced a transient decrease in cell rigidity followed by a return to control level in 10 minutes, whereas treatment with 30 mumols/L CTB resulted in a sustained decrease in cell transit times to a level 60% of control. Addition of 3 mumols/L CTB to cells prestimulated with FMLP produced a rapid (1 to 2 minutes) cessation of changes in cellular deformability produced by the FMLP. Colchicine treatment did not decrease cell rigidity, but produced a delayed increase in F-actin content accompanied by increased stiffness of the cells. These results implicate actin as the major determinant of the mechanical behavior of the neutrophil, as measured by whole cell deformability tests. The significant changes in cell deformability that occur in response to fractional changes in F-actin content suggest that changes in the structure of the actin network occur during these processes.\r"

  ".W": "In order to evaluate the functions of lymphocyte function antigen-1 (LFA-1) (CD11a/CD18) and Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18) on neonatal neutrophils, we examined neutrophil adhesion to and migration through human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers in vitro. Transendothelial migration of adult neutrophils was greatly enhanced by preincubation of HUVEC with interleukin-1 (IL-1). This migration was significantly inhibited by monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against LFA-1 (CD11a) and Mac-1 (CD11b) subunits. Migration of neonatal neutrophils was markedly diminished compared to adult neutrophils, and MoAbs against LFA-1 further reduced migration. In contrast, anti-Mac-1 MoAb was not inhibitory. Adhesion of adult neutrophils was significantly enhanced by prestimulation of HUVEC with IL-1, and was significantly inhibited by MoAbs against LFA-1. Adhesion of neonatal neutrophils was near adult levels and comparably inhibited by anti-LFA-1 MoAb. In addition, adhesion of neonatal and adult neutrophils to purified ICAM-1 in artificial planar membranes was comparable and almost completely inhibited by anti-LFA-1 MoAb. Chemotactic stimulation induced Mac-1-dependent adhesion of adult neutrophils to endothelial cells, purified intercellular adherence molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and protein-coated glass. In marked contrast, adhesion of neonatal neutrophils to these substrates was not significantly increased by chemotactic stimulation. These findings indicate that diminished transendothelial migration by neonatal neutrophils is related to abnormal interactions of Mac-1 with ICAM-1 and possibly other endothelial ligands. These functional deficits may contribute to impaired inflammation and infectious susceptibility in human neonates.\r"

  ".W": "Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) possess a potent oxygen-dependent microbicidal system that depends on the activity of a stimulus-activated multicomponent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase. Patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) lack activity of this oxidase and consequently suffer severe and frequent infections. Components of the oxidase include both membrane-bound factors (most notably, cytochrome b559, which is absent in the X-linked form of CGD) and at least two cytosolic factors, one or the other of which is absent in autosomal CGD. Patients with CGD, particularly the autosomal type, have defective phosphorylation of proteins in the 44 to 48 Kd range. A polyclonal antiserum (B-1) that recognizes cytosolic oxidase components of 47 and 67 Kd was used to identify phosphoproteins in a cell-free oxidase system. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed the identity of the 47-Kd cytosolic protein (p47-phox) recognized by B-1 and the cationic 47-Kd protein that is phosphorylated in normal but not p47-phox-deficient CGD cytosol during activation of the NADPH-dependent oxidase. All full-length and C-terminal recombinant p47-phox proteins augmented the superoxide-generating capacity of the cell-free system and were phosphorylated when added to cytosol from normal subjects or from a patient with p47-deficient autosomal CGD. These studies provide compelling evidence that the 47-Kd cationic protein that is a substrate for phosphorylation during the activation of PMNs is, in fact, p47-phox, a cytosolic protein previously shown to be critical for normal activity of the NADPH-dependent oxidase of PMNs.\r"

When inherited in trans to an alpha-thal-1 mutation (-), it results in Hb H disease associated with low levels (9%) of the Suan-Dok Hb. The nature of the thalassemic defect associated with the alpha SD mutation has been investigated by structural and functional studies. Sequence analysis of the cloned Suan-Dok allele showed a missense mutation (T----G) at codon 109 in an otherwise normal alpha 2-globin gene. When the alpha 2SD-globin gene was introduced into mouse erythroleukemia cells, the steady state alpha-globin messenger RNA (mRNA) level was equivalent to the alpha A-globin gene control. Although in vitro translation of a synthetic alpha 2SD-globin mRNA generated levels of alpha globin equivalent to alpha 2A-globin mRNA at early time points, the ratio of alpha SD to alpha A globin decreased markedly at later time points. These data suggest that the thalassemic defect associated with the Suan-Dok mutation results from a significant instability of the alpha SD globin.\r"

  ".W": "The Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome is present in greater than 90% of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and in 2% to 20% of those with acute leukemias, for which it is an important prognostic marker too. The chimeric BCR-ABL mRNAs resulting from the translocation encode either a 210-Kd or a 190-Kd protein. The techniques used to detect Ph1 chromosome include karyotyping, Southern analysis to demonstrate bcr rearrangement, and polymerase chain reaction to amplify the BCR-ABL transcripts. However, the routine performance of these methods by clinical laboratories is cumbersome, time consuming, and exposes laboratory personnel to radioisotopes. We describe here the clinical application of a new method, the hybridization protection assay (HPA), which uses chemiluminescent acridinium-ester-labeled probes in conjunction with PCR for detection of the amplified BCR-ABL sequences. The method is sensitive, specific, and can reliably distinguish between the transcripts for P190BCR-ABL and P210BCR-ABL. In contrast to the 2 days or longer required for conventional hybridization, HPA analysis can be completed in less than 30 minutes. We have successfully used this method to analyze 60 leukemia samples (34 from Ph1-negative acute leukemias; 6 from Ph1-positive acute leukemias; and 20 from CML) with complete correlation (of BCR-ABL positivity or negativity) with the results of karyotype or Southern Blot analysis of genomic DNA for bcr rearrangement. Therefore, the HPA, in conjunction with PCR, appears to provide a rapid and reliable test for the diagnosis of Ph1-positivity.\r"

  ".W": "The product of the c-raf-1 proto-oncogene, Raf-1, is a 74,000-dalton cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase that has been implicated as an intermediate in signal transduction mechanisms. In the human factor-dependent myeloid cell line MO7, both granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) were found to induce rapid, dose-dependent phosphorylation of Raf-1, which resulted in altered Raf-1 mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. The increase in phosphorylation was due primarily to an increase in phosphoserine, with only a minor component (less than 2%) of phosphotyrosine. PMA (12-phorbol 13-myristic acid) also induced Raf-1 phosphorylation in MO7 cells, but the resulting alteration in electrophoretic mobility was different than that observed after GM-CSF or IL-3. GM-CSF and IL-3 rapidly and transiently increased Raf-1 kinase activity using Histone H1 as a substrate in an immune complex kinase assay in vitro. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Raf-1 could play a role in some aspect of GM-CSF and IL-3 signal transduction.\r"

Bone marrow was T-cell depleted to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). To prevent graft failure, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the CD11a-lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) molecule was infused into the patients. Eleven patients received five infusions of 0.1 mg/kg every other day from day -3 to +5. Thirty-five patients received 0.2 mg/kg daily from day -3 to +6. The overall sustained engraftment rate was 72% instead of 26.1% in a historical control group of 24 patients similarly treated except for the infusion of the anti-LFA-1 antibody. No late rejection occurred. The T-cell depletion method (E-rosetting or Campath IM plus complement) resulted in different rate of engraftment (83.3% v 57.9%, respectively, P = .05). Engraftment rate was slightly but not significantly influenced by the degree of HLA incompatibility between donor and recipient. Acute GVHD of grade II or more occurred in 35.5% of the patients and the rate of chronic GVHD was 12.9%. The overall actuarial survival rate with a functional graft is 47.3% with a mean follow-up of 28.0 months for patients with immunodeficiency and osteopetrosis, while none of the four patients with Fanconi's anemia survived. The development of full T-cell functions took on the average 6 months and of full B-cell functions 10 months. Significant infectious problems developed in the majority of the patients during the posttransplant course. Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell proliferative syndromes were observed in seven patients, six of whom had Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Correction of immunodeficiency was comparable in terms of kinetics and quality with that observed in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency undergoing HLA-nonidentical BMT. Correction of osteopetrosis appears not to be different from what has been observed after HLA-identical BMT. The in vivo use of an anti-CD11a-LFA-1 antibody as an additional immunosuppressive therapy in HLA-nonidentical BMT may thus promote engraftment and survival with correction of the primary disease in a significant number of patients with life-threatening immunodeficiency and osteopetrosis, but not with Fanconi's anemia.\r"

In patients with nephrotic syndrome, a normal serum creatinine value, and no echocardiographic evidence of cardiac amyloidosis, the response rate was 39% (12 of 31). Five of 34 patients with amyloid cardiomyopathy responded. Two of these five are alive 10 years after diagnosis. None of the 18 patients with amyloid peripheral neuropathy showed regression of their disease. The median time to achieve response was 11.7 months. The median survival of the 27 patients was 89.4 months and 21 of 27 survived 5 years (78%). Eight patients remain alive with a minimum follow-up of 90 months. Seven died of acute leukemia or dysmyelopoietic syndrome, a presumed complication of melphalan therapy.

To further understand the regulation of Epo gene expression, we studied the effects of hypoxia and CoCl2 on the rate of Epo gene transcription. While Northern blot analyses showed that steady-state Epo mRNA levels increase more than 50-fold in response to hypoxia or CoCl2, nuclear run-off experiments demonstrated only a 10-fold increase in Epo gene transcription in response to these stimuli. In the presence of either actinomycin D (Act D) or cycloheximide, the stability of biologically functional Epo mRNA was much greater than that observed in the absence of these agents and much greater than that which has been reported in vivo. These findings suggest that the stability of Epo mRNA is modulated by the transcription and translation of rapidly turning over gene product(s). Thus, Epo mRNA levels are determined by both the rate of gene transcription and posttranscriptional events. These experiments demonstrate a potential pitfall in estimating mRNA half-lives based on Act D chase experiments alone.\r"

  ".W": "Because the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B produces erythropoietin (Epo) in a regulated fashion, it can be used to investigate the cis-acting regulatory elements of the Epo gene. Comparison of primate and mouse sequences shows strong homology not only in the coding sequence but also within the 5' flanking region, the first intron, and the 3' flanking region. These portions of the Epo gene were inserted 5' and 3' to a reporter gene, human growth hormone (GH). 5A is a 1,192-base pair (bp) HindIII-Xbal fragment that extends from 378 bp 5' to the cap site through the first intron. To obviate the problem of false initiation of translation from the Epo ATG start codon, this site was changed to TAG by site-directed mutagenesis. 3A is a 255-bp Accl-BglII fragment that extends 67 bp upstream from the Epo termination codon and covers most of the 3' noncoding region of homology. The plasmid DNAs were transfected by electroporation into Hep3B cells with RSVCAT as an internal standard to correct for transfection efficiency. One aliquot of cells was exposed to 50 mumol/L CoCl2 or to 1% O2. At the end of the incubations, GH and Epo were measured in the cell media and the cell pellet was assayed for CAT. Production of GH was stimulated 1.7-fold by cobalt or hypoxia. Furthermore, addition of 3A to the GH gene, irrespective of orientation, stimulated GH production 2.6-fold with CoCl2 and 2.3-fold with hypoxia. Stable cell lines were produced by cotransfection of the above constructions, along with the selectable marker pSV-Neo. In two clones, exposure to hypoxia resulted in much more marked (16-fold) induction of GH. Stimulus of both GH and Epo production by hypoxia was partially abrogated by carbon monoxide. These results demonstrate the presence of promoter and enhancer elements within the human Epo gene that are appropriately responsive to hypoxia and cobalt.\r"

Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and IL-6, cytokines with a broad spectrum of biologic activities, stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro. To determine if expression of these factors might increase in response to experimental thrombocytopenia, we measured steady-state levels of IL-3 and IL-6 mRNA following rabbit antiplatelet serum (APS) injection. Groups of mice were injected intravenously with 0.2 mL APS while control animals received rabbit antilymphocyte serum (ALS), normal rabbit serum (NRS), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). At various times up to 72 hours after injection mice were exsanguinated and splenectomized. Platelet counts in the experimental animals were less than 12% of controls. Splenic RNA was hybridized in solution to 32P-UTP-labeled cRNA probes for IL-3 and IL-6. RNase-resistant hybrids were resolved on denaturing gels and visualized autoradiographically. IL-3 hybrids were undetectable at all time points tested, irrespective of the film exposure time or specific activity of the probe. Conversely, IL-6 hybrids were easily visualized and showed peak expression at 1.5 to 2.0 hours. By 3 hours, IL-6 mRNA had returned almost to the level of the controls. Similar results were observed in the bone marrow, although maximal IL-6 mRNA in that tissue was observed 4 hours following APS administration. To determine if this mRNA increment was associated with a concomitant increase in bioactive protein, serum was tested for its ability to stimulate IL-6-dependent B9 cells. At 1.75 hours following injection, experimental animals showed a small but significant increment in IL-6 activity compared with controls (200 +/- 30 U/mL IL-6 compared with 129 +/- 17 U/mL in ALS-injected controls, 106 +/- 17 U/mL in NRS-injected controls and 84 +/- 17 U/mL in PBS-injected controls). The data show that IL-6 mRNA and bioactive protein increase in response to acute immunothrombocytopenia, while no increment in IL-3 is detectable. These results suggest that IL-6 may play a role in the physiologic response to acute immunothrombocytopenia.\r"

LCM is known to contain both cytokine(s) and the L-cell virus, a murine retrovirus found in the L929 cell and LCM. Our evidence suggests that both LCM cytokine(s) and the L-cell virus are involved in this PCMV endothelial cell transformation. Criteria for transformation include focus formation, decreased serum requirements for growth, changes in morphology including nonadherence, propagation in suspension culture, and a decreased growth response to stimulation with a known endothelial cell mitogen. Macrophage-like characteristics of this transformed cell, designated as RVTE, include pinocytosis of low-density lipoprotein, Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis, phagocytosis of bacteria and zymosan, the expression of macrophage enzyme markers, and constitutive production of colony-stimulating factor 1. However, the transformed cell retains several properties of the nontransformed cell including the expression of FVIII:RAg and in vitro self-organization into capillary-like structures. Cloning of RVTE cells clearly shows that both macrophage-like and cerebral microvascular endothelial cell properties are present in the same cell. During self-organization, nontransformed cells express morphologic and functional characteristics classically associated with the macrophage. These findings suggest that some brain capillary pathophysiologies could involve macrophage-like cerebral microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, the \"reticuloendothelial\" phenotypic repertoire expressed by this transformed cerebral microvascular endothelial cell may show that the cerebral capillary endothelial cell in vivo is derived from a hematopoietic and/or phagocytic precursor.\r"

In situ hybridization using the 35S alpha and beta fibrinogen chain anti-sense riboprobes was totally negative in MK in comparison with negative controls (lambda phage and alpha and beta fibrinogen chain sense riboprobes). In contrast, synthesis of fibrinogen was detected by this technique in a hepatoma cell line (HepG 2). Furthermore, mRNA for alpha and beta chains of fibrinogen was not detected by the PCR performed on mRNA from cultured MK enriched to 90% purity, by the immunomagnetic bead technique, even after Southern blotting of the amplified products. In addition, fibrinogen mRNA was undetected in marrow MK and in platelets by the same technique, whereas a specific megakaryocyte gene transcript (GPIb alpha) was easily detected. These observations demonstrate that the only mechanism responsible for the presence of fibrinogen in platelets is endocytosis of fibrinogen from plasma.\r"

  ".U": "91091523\r", 
  ".W": "Our previous findings suggested that coagulation factor XFriuli could be functionally defective owing to a point mutation in the portion of the factor X gene coding for the fully activated heavy chain. To verify the existence of this postulated change, we analyzed all eight exons of the normal and Friuli factor X gene. Each exon was amplified from genomic DNA using the polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the plasmid pUC19. The amplified DNA inserts were subjected to direct sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method with forward and reverse oligonucleotide sequencing primers. A point mutation (C to T transition at nucleotide position 19,297) that results in coding for serine (TCC) in place of proline (CCC) at amino acid position 343 was found. This substitution involves a highly conserved proline residue oriented spatially close to both the cleavage site of the zymogen and the active site of the enzyme and explains the previous observations of discrete biochemical and functional differences between factor XFriuli and normal factor X. The mutation abolished an HgiCI restriction site present in the normal factor X gene, and this change constitutes the basis for a convenient method for screening individuals carrying this molecular defect. Proline343 is in conserved region 5 of the serine protease superfamily to which factor X belongs and is part of a 14-residue L*****P******C motif that occurs in at least 16 other enzymes. Computer analysis suggests that the motif may be an essential aspect of conformational features important to functional properties of factor X as well as other serine proteases.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the relationship of bcr-abl fusion mRNAs with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL), we examined 27 pediatric Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive acute leukemias using a reverse polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure. In cells from 24 leukemias, single bcr-abl PCR products were detected that corresponded to breakpoints in the minor breakpoint cluster region (mbcr in intron 1 of the bcr gene) associated with production of the P190 fusion protein. Cells from the three remaining leukemias contained breakpoints in the major breakpoint cluster region (Mbcr) as shown by PCR and Southern blot analyses. These three leukemias also contained low levels of the mbcr PCR product that may have resulted from alternative splicing of the bcr-abl precursor RNA. A screen of 35 additional leukemias from patients who failed therapy before day 180 (induction failures or early relapses) found one case with unsuccessful cytogenetics to express Mbcr-abl RNA. All four children with Mbcr breakpoints had white blood cell levels in excess of 250,000 at presentation (compared with 2 of 24 with mbcr breakpoints) and two had hematologic and clinical features suggestive of chronic myelogenous leukemias (CML) in lymphoid blast crisis. Our results indicate that in Ph1-positive pediatric leukemias, all 9;22 breakpoints occur in one of the two known breakpoint cluster regions in the bcr gene on chromosome 22. The reverse PCR reliably detected all patients with cytogenetic t(9;22) and is capable of detecting additional Ph1-positive leukemias that are missed by standard cytogenetics. Furthermore, the Mbcr-type breakpoint, associated with production of p210, can be seen in childhood leukemias presenting either as clinical ALL or as apparent lymphoid blast crisis of CML, suggesting that t(9;22) breakpoint locations do not exclusively determine the biologic and clinical features of pediatric Ph1-positive ALL.\r"

  ".W": "Although mRNA for the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR-alpha) is expressed in many different myeloid leukemias, most of these leukemia cells exhibit little if any phenotypic response when exposed to retinoic acid (RA). To determine whether such RA resistance is related to altered RA receptor structure or function, we performed a detailed analysis of nuclear RA receptors in RA-resistant K-562 cells. These cells exhibit RA receptors of the same approximate molecular weight and similar kd as those exhibited by the RA-sensitive HL-60 leukemia cell line, but the number of RA receptors in the RA-resistant K-562 cells (80 per cell) is significantly lower than that exhibited by RA-sensitive HL-60 cells (550 per cell). Retroviral-mediated transduction of RAR-alpha cDNA into K-562 significantly increased the number of RA receptors to 2,000 per cell. These RAR-alpha-transduced K-562 cells, when incubated with RA, exhibit diminished cell proliferation associated with decreased c-myc expression and an accumulation of cells in G0/G1. In addition, these RA-treated cells exhibit downregulation of the CD15 surface antigen and a slight increase in hemoglobin production but manifest no other evidence of significant erythroid, megakaryocytic, or myeloid differentiation. These results indicate that an elevated number of nuclear RA receptors can be involved in altering proliferation but not necessarily the differentiation of certain RA-treated myeloid leukemia cells.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to develop a clinically useful approach to overcoming P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR1), we evaluated combined chemosensitization with verapamil and quinine in a multidrug-resistant (MDR) human myeloma cell line model. In clonogenic assay, verapamil was used at concentrations from 0.1 to 1.0 micrograms/mL, bracketing the plasma levels achieved by oral administration and high-dose intravenous (IV) infusion, respectively. The dose of quinine was held constant at 1.0 micrograms/mL, a plasma concentration readily achieved by oral administration. At each dose level of verapamil tested, the combination with quinine proved more effective than either drug individually in reversing resistance to doxorubicin and vinblastine and synergistic chemosensitizing interaction was observed. Verapamil at 0.1 microgram/mL combined with quinine was capable of restoring sensitivity to doxorubicin fully and reduced resistance to vinblastine as effectively as verapamil alone at 1.0 micrograms/mL. Furthermore, the combination of 1.0 mumol verapamil with 10 mumols quinine increased accumulation and retention of anthracycline in the resistant cells to a greater extent than did either drug individually (P less than .001) and inhibited drug efflux as effectively as verapamil alone at 10 mumols. Our findings suggest that combined chemosensitization with verapamil and quinine may prove useful for overcoming MDR1 in patients with drug-refractory B-cell neoplasms such as multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\r"

Etoposide (VP16; 20 to 30 micrograms/mL) with or without cytosine arabinoside (Ara C; 10 mg/mL) was used in tandem with the anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), MY9, chosen because CD33 is found on the stem cell pool in the majority of patients with ANLL. The agents were tested singly or sequentially, with a 1-hour incubation of the drugs preceding complement-mediated lysis using MY9. VP16 combined with Ara C killed up to 3.9 +/- 0.3 and 5.11 +/- 0.4 logs of the human ANLL cell lines HL60 and K562 at drug concentrations that killed only 1.2 +/- 0.1 logs of normal committed granulocyte/macrophage stem cells (CFU-GM). Adding a single exposure of the MY9 and complement (C') to the drug-treated cells, greater than 5.4 logs of HL60 were killed. Similar to other pharmacologic agents, no differential kill for clonagenic leukemic cells (colony-forming unit-leukemia; CFU-L) from patients with ANLL was seen for drug only treated blasts versus normal CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), with less than 1 log CFU-L kill at drug concentrations that spared 1 log of CFU-GM. Similarly, only 1.1 +/- 0.3 logs of ANLL CFU-L were eliminated using MY9 and C'. However, with the sequential VP16/Ara C----MY9 + C' treatment, synergy was demonstrated and 2.6 +/- 0.3 logs of CFU-L were eliminated. Because CD33 is also found on the normal CFU-GM pool, two-stage long-term BM cultures were performed to determine pluripotent stem cell elimination by the drug/MoAb purging combination. No difference of CFU-GM or BFU-E production at 4 to 6 weeks of culture for VP16/Ara C, MY9 + C', or VP16/AraC----My9 + C' treated cells was seen compared with untreated controls indicating sparing of early progenitor cells. Sequential ex vivo treatment of human ANLL CFU-L with VP16/Ara C followed by complement-mediated lysis using MY9 synergistically kills CFU-L while sparing early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, and thus may be a more effective way to purge BM than either alone.\r"

  ".W": "Maturation of human myeloid cells is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes in protein kinase C (PKC) and increases in N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (FMLP) receptors, actin, and actin regulatory proteins. We have studied the actin responses and cell shape changes caused by FMLP and its second messenger pathways in HL60 cells undergoing neutrophilic maturation. In uninduced cells, the PKC activators 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), bryostatin, and 1-oleyl-2-acetylglycerol (OAG) resulted in 15% to 30% decreases in F-actin, whereas FMLP had no effect. Ionomycin had no effect on actin but did cause a 10-fold increase in intracellular calcium. Cells grown for 24 hours in 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) acquired the ability to polymerize actin in response to FMLP and ionomycin. TPA continued to cause a decrease in F-actin at 24 hours, but caused an increase in F-actin at 48 to 72 hours of maturation. The PKC inhibitor 1-5-isoquinolinesulfonyl 2-methylpiperazine (H7) partially blocked the F-actin increase caused by TPA in induced cells, but had no effect on the decrease in F-actin caused by TPA in uninduced cells or the increase in F-actin seen in FMLP-treated neutrophils. F-actin rich pseudopods developed following TPA or FMLP stimulation of induced HL60 cells; in uninduced cells neither agent caused pseudopod formation but TPA caused a dramatic loss of surface ruffles. The ability of FMLP and ionomycin to elicit a neutrophil-like actin response in HL60 cells within 24 hours after DMSO treatment shows that the actin regulatory mechanism is mature by that time. The inability of ionomycin to increase F-actin in uninduced cells supports the view that calcium increases alone are insufficient for actin polymerization. The longer maturation time required for HL60 cells to develop an actin polymerization response to TPA compared with FMLP, coupled with the inability of H7 to block the FMLP-mediated F-actin increase in neutrophils, suggests that the F-actin increase caused by FMLP is not mediated solely by PKC. Lastly, the TPA-induced F-actin decrease and shape changes in uninduced HL60 cells, and the longer time required for a \"mature\" response to TPA, may reflect immaturity in the PKC isoenzyme pattern rather than immaturity of the actin regulatory mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a patient with thalassemia intermedia-like phenotype born to normal parents in whom globin gene sequencing detected a novel abnormal hemoglobin (Hb) due to a T to A substitution at codon 60 of the beta-globin gene arising as a de novo mutation. Normal sequences were detected at the homologous beta-globin locus. This mutation results in the substitution of a polar (glutamic acid) for a nonpolar (valine) residue near the corner of the heme pocket of the beta-globin chain. The novel variant has been designated Hb Cagliari, from the place of birth of the propositus. Kinetics of globin synthesis performed following splenectomy suggest that this new Hb variant is synthesized at a near normal rate but undergoes rapid breakdown. The extreme lability of the variant explains the clinical and hematologic picture characterized by marked ineffective erythropoiesis, thalassemia-like bone changes, iron overload, high proportion of Hb F in the peripheral blood, reduced beta/alpha-globin chain synthesis ratio in peripheral blood reticulocytes, and absence of the abnormal Hb in peripheral blood at extensive protein structural analysis before splenectomy. This case indicates that a thalassemic hemoglobinopathy should be suspected in the presence of a patient with a thalassemia intermedia-like phenotype born to normal parents, even when protein structural analysis fails to detect an abnormal Hb. DNA sequencing may allow to define the mutation, thus making the proper diagnosis.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism by which IVIg exerts its effect on the complement system, we examined the possible interference with the C4 step of the classical complement cascade. We examined the capacity of autologous serum containing high concentrations of human IVIg to deposit C4 fragments onto model targets (guinea pig and/or human erythrocytes sensitized with rabbit anti-guinea pig/human erythrocytes IgG antibody). C4 binding was quantified with radiolabeled anti-C4. Guinea pig serum with added IVIg suppressed C4 uptake onto IgG-sensitized guinea pig erythrocytes at all time points (0, 5, 15, and 30 minutes). Using sera of guinea pigs treated with increasing doses of IVIg, this effect was shown to be dose-responsive. Serum from a patient treated with IVIg showed reduced C4 uptake onto sensitized homologous RBCs. In comparison with the serum from the same patient before IVIg therapy was administered, levels were decreased almost to background. C4 functional titers in those two samples were not different. C3 uptake was studied in parallel with C4 to compare the degree of inhibition using sera with increasing doses of IVIg in both the human and guinea pig system. C3 and C4 inhibition curves completely overlapped. Our findings suggest that IVIg is an effective inhibitor of deposition of early complement activation products (C4b, C3b) onto target surfaces and may indicate interference of IVIg with multiple sites of complement activation.\r"

Synthetic oligonucleotides spanning coding regions for M,N,S, and s epitopes were used to examine DNAs from 50 individuals selected at random and from individuals known to exhibit S(-)s(-)U- or S(-)s(-)U+ blood group phenotypes. We showed that M,N,S,s, blood group-specific sequences occur as multicopies in the human genome and reside within the alpha and delta glycophorin genes and also within the third glycophorin gene (glycophorin E gene). DNA typing with M- and N-epitope-specific probes showed distinct patterns that allowed correlation of the genotypes with the blood group phenotypes. The correlation using S- and s-specific probes was less definite owing to cross-hybridization. An Mspl restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) residing in the E gene was detected in the black population. This RFLP is also carried by all individuals tested who exhibit the S(-)s(-)U- and S(-)s(-)U+ blood groups phenotypes, thereby serving as a useful marker for the S-s- alleles. The site of cleavage resulting in this RFLP was localized to the second intron of the E gene, and cleavage could occur through differential methylation of its two alleles.\r"

FVA cells undergo differentiation in vitro from the proerythroblast stage through the reticulocyte stage over a 48-hour period in the presence of erythropoietin. Concomitant with marked decreases in cellular size and energy demand, metabolic capacities of both glycolysis and oxygen consumption diminish after 48 hours in culture by 7- and 18-fold, respectively. Because the oxidative capacity decreases more than glycolytic ability does, the metabolic machinery increasingly shifts toward anaerobic metabolism. During the 48-hour period of differentiation, the 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid (DPG) content per cell and 2,3-DPG mutase activity per cell increased eightfold and threefold, respectively. Freshly harvested FVA cells have adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels of 7.23 +/- 2.52 mumol/10(10) cells or 3.76 +/- 1.31 mumol/mL cell water which are 12- or 2.3-fold higher, respectively, than the ATP levels of mature red blood cells. In the course of FVA cell differentiation, ATP content per cell decreases by fourfold, but ATP concentration in cell water remains unchanged because of a corresponding decrease in cellular size and water content during differentiation. These studies show that in the face of dramatic decreases in cell size and cellular energy demand, terminally differentiating erythroid cells maintain a constant ATP level by undergoing an involution of their glycolytic machinery as well as by losing their aerobic metabolic capacity.\r"

The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of low neutrophil function for late pyogenic infections. Chemotaxis, superoxide production, and phagocytic-bactericidal activity were studied before and 2, 6, 9, and 12 months after BMT. Skin window migration was quantitatively assessed 2 months after BMT. Infectious complications were recorded prospectively with preset criteria during 1 year. Six of the 20 leukemic patients had defective neutrophil function before BMT. Two months after BMT all 10 patients with greater than stage II graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and 6 of 10 patients with less than or equal to stage II GVHD had at least one decreased function. At this time, patients with subsequent pyogenic infections had lower chemotaxis (P less than .05), phagocytic-bactericidal activity (P less than .005), and superoxide production (P less than .025) than those without. Defective skin window migration and combined defects were predictive for late pyogenic infections. At 9 months all tests were normal in seven patients surviving without GVHD. In contrast, at 9 months three of three patients, and at 1 year two of three with chronic GVHD had still decreased neutrophil function. In conclusion, neutrophil function is frequently impaired during the first months after BMT. Combined neutrophil defects predispose to pyogenic infections and indicate the patient at risk.\r"

  ".W": "Optimum methods of harvesting circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation to support myeloablative cancer therapy are still uncertain, mostly because of the lack of an assay for marrow-repopulating stem cells. The CFU-GM assay, the commonly used indirect indicator of the quality of the graft, is poorly standardized and provides results evaluable only retrospectively. Based on the knowledge that hematopoietic progenitors express CD34 and CD33 differentiation antigens, we developed a dual-color direct immunofluorescence flow cytometry assay with the aim of replacing the CFU-GM assay advantageously. For this purpose, we applied both assays to 157 blood samples obtained daily throughout 20 different recoveries from pancytopenia induced by high-dose cyclophosphamide or etoposide cancer therapy with or without recombinant human GM colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). The appearance of CD34+ cells in the circulation indicated that hematopoietic progenitors had increased to more than 500 CFU-GM/mL, a level clinically adequate for large-scale harvest by leukapheresis. Total CD34+ cells correlated well with CFU-GM (r = .89), and data could be fitted by a linear regression line described by the equation y = 388.3 + 64.0x, where y = CFU-GM/mL and x = CD34+ cells per microliter. Moreover, in a series of six patients treated with myeloablative chemoradiotherapy, early hematopoietic recovery of marrow functions was predicted more accurately by the number of transplanted CD34+/CD33+ cells than by either total nucleated cells, CFU-GM, CD34+/CD33- cells, or CD34-/CD33+ cells. Data presented in this article favor clinical use of the CD34/CD33 flow cytometry assay to guide harvesting of circulating hematopoietic progenitors for autologous transplantation and contribute to better understanding of the role played by circulating hematopoietic progenitor cell subsets in marrow recovery after myeloablative cancer therapy.\r"

Four urinary proteins, with a molecular weight range of 160000-14500, immunoglobulin G (IgG), N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase (NAG), albumin and lysozyme, were monitored in 27 patients 1 day before and 1, 7, 30, 90 and 180 days after unilateral EPL treatment. All patients had non-obstructive renal stones, previously untreated. Apart from 5 patients with stablised hypertension and 6 with persistent urinary infections due to the infected stones, all patients appeared healthy, as confirmed by clinical, haematological and biochemical investigations. Only albumin levels increased significantly 1 day after treatment; statistically nonsignificant increases and decreases were recorded in the levels of NAG and lysozome respectively. IgG was beyond the limit of detection (less than 0.5 mg%) in all patients. The albumin level returned to normal 7 days after treatment. The EPL-induced increase in albumin was recorded in 88% of patients, compared with increased levels of NAG in 46% and lysozyme in 64%, mainly in those with infected stones. These findings indicated a transient glomerular injury after EPL treatment.\r"

This may be due to methodological and design differences between the 2 studies, but does suggest reservations about the significance of lowered urinary fibrinolytic activity as a risk factor for renal stone disease. Dietary information from those taking part in the study suggests that a reduction of meat intake by stone formers might be associated with increased urinary fibrinolytic activity. This might account for the discrepancy between the 2 studies, in which case this observation could be of significance.\r"

Four cases were associated with tuberous sclerosis, 1 with spinal neurilemmoma, 1 with transitional cell carcinoma and another with renal tuberculosis. The presenting symptoms in decreasing frequencies were flank pain, mass, haematuria, fever, syncope and respiratory distress. Although it has often been said that angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis are small and asymptomatic, all 4 such patients in this study had large symptomatic tumours. Before the advent of CT scan and ultrasonography, the pre-operative diagnostic rate for cases unassociated with tuberous sclerosis was 10% (1/10). With the combined use of these 2 modalities, the diagnostic rate increased to 60% (6/10). Most patients in this series were treated with nephrectomy. However, equally good outcomes occurred in 2 patients who received partial nephrectomies. Pre-operative diagnosis now makes it possible to consider more conservative management.\r"

We report 3 cases of primary small cell carcinoma of the kidney, urinary bladder and prostate with light microscopic, immunohistochemical and electron microscopic findings. One patient with small cell carcinoma of the prostate died of disseminated disease 2 years after diagnosis and another patient with small cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder was free of tumour after 6 months. A partial remission was induced in the third patient with distant metastases of small cell carcinoma of the kidney by using chemotherapy protocols similar to the drug regimens for small cell carcinomas of the lung; the patient survived for 5 months. Immunohistochemical studies revealed the absence of argyrophilic immunostaining of tumour cells in all 3 cases, positive staining for keratin in 2 and staining for neuron-specific enolase in all 3. In the third patient, reactivity for prostate-specific antigen was negative. Dense-core, membrane-bound granules were identified in the cytoplasm of 2 patients. The paraneoplastic syndrome was not found, indicating that in considering the occurrence of ectopic hormones, specific cytoplasmic granules of origin need not be implicated. Recognition of this distinct entity requires full consideration of morphological, immunohistological, ultrastructural and biological features. In order to define the origin of this tumour more clearly and to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy, larger series of patients are needed.\r"

In addition, an omentally supported bladder graft was established separately for use in a \"retrieval\" procedure should extension graft stenosis develop subsequently. Of 10 dogs studied for 6 months, 2 required \"retrieval\" pedicled island patch grafts for stenoses at extension graft/upper ureteric junctions. Healthy urothelium with muscle in the walls was seen in grafts resting on their supporting omental beds. At the time of sacrificing, none of the operated upper tracts was obstructed.\r"

Deafferentation produced adverse changes in vesicourethral function and even when rhizotomy was complete, continence could not be guaranteed. The pre-operative state of the bladder neck and distal sphincter mechanism had an important bearing on future continence and those patients with a closed bladder neck and no previous sphincterotomy had the greatest chance of becoming continent after deafferentation. The majority of patients in this series are now fully continent, representing a transformation in their quality of life; it is recommended, however, that to optimise the success of rhizotomy precise pre-operative evaluation and selection of patients are essential.\r"

Among the 76 M0 patients the mean levels of all 3 markers were slightly higher in patients with moderately differentiated prostatic carcinoma. Among the 24 M1 patients the primary tumour was either G2 (18 patients) or G3 (6 patients); none had G1 lesions. Significantly higher serum ACP and PAP levels were found in patients with G2 tumours than in those with G3 lesions. It was concluded that the histological differentiation grade of prostatic carcinoma did affect serum levels of prostatic tumour markers; the tendency towards higher levels in the G2 group was noticeable in both non-metastatic and metastatic cases despite the limited number of patients in the latter category. In clinical practice this information may be an important additional tool in staging prostatic cancer.\r"

Ultrasonographic appearance was not specific for a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst and exploratory surgery was required in all cases. Excision of the tumour and biopsy of adjacent testicular tissue to determine the presence or absence of carcinoma in situ is adequate treatment for this rare testicular neoplasm.\r"

Catheter encrustation and urinary infection are other disadvantages associated with long-term catheterisation. In the present study, 77 male patients were catheterised randomly as part of their normal treatment with 1 of 3 different types of catheter: 22 siliconised latex, 28 hydrogel-coated latex and 27 full silicone catheters. The mean duration of catheterisation was 2.2 days. The urethral inflammatory reaction was assessed from cytological urethral swab specimens. Catheter encrustation was studied using scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis. The full silicone catheters induced the mildest degree of inflammation in the urethra, the percentage mean of inflammatory cells in smears being 20%. In both latex catheter groups the value was 36%. Neither the age of the patients nor the duration of catheterisation had any effect on the inflammatory reaction, which was more marked in patients with haemodynamic abnormalities. The hydrogel coating effectively prevented encrustation, while siliconised latex catheters were the least resistant to encrustation. The inflammatory reaction was variable in all patients. The use of urethral catheters should be restricted and suprapubic tubes should be used instead, particularly in patients with shock-like circulatory changes. By developing the biocompatibility and physical properties of urinary catheters, more compatible devices may be manufactured.\r"

Among the 5209 subjects, 1201 malignancies were confirmed. Median age at diagnosis was 69 for men and 65 for women. Lung, prostate, skin, and colon accounted for more than half of men's cancers; breast, colon, and skin made up half of the women's. FHS and Connecticut SEER rates matched closely, with the same primary tumor sites appearing commonly in both groups. Thus, the FHS cohort should provide a fair database for analysis of risk factors in cancer incidence, as it has done in cardiovascular diseases.\r"

DNA ploidy was concordant among the three samples in 38 cases (63.3%). In the remaining 22 cases (36.6%), the DNA histograms of two of the three multiple samples were similar; however, the ploidy of the third sample was discordant. No relationship was observed between Dukes' stage and histologic grade with concordance or discordance among samples. Thus, in about one third of the colonic carcinomas, a single sample showing either a diploid or diploid-cycling DNA histogram would not detect aneuploid DNA patterns. Comparison of scrapes and fine-needle aspirates of tumors as alternative sampling methods of tumors for DNA ploidy analysis indicated a strong association with the tumor ploidy (84% and 96%, respectively) only when the ploidy of the multiple samples was concordant. In about 25% of the cases, tumor scrapes and fine-needle aspirates did not correlate with the \"most abnormal\" ploidy observed in one of the three tissue samples. The data suggest that single or even double tissue samples may not show aneuploid DNA patterns in a substantial proportion of colorectal cancers.\r"

  ".W": "The percent tumor necrosis was determined in 200 dogs with spontaneously occurring osteosarcoma. One hundred dogs had no treatment before amputation or death. One hundred other dogs were treated with either radiation therapy alone (n = 23), intraarterial (IA) cisplatin alone (n = 16), intravenous (IV) cisplatin alone (n = 6), radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin (n = 47), or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin (n = 8). Eighty-nine of these 100 dogs had their tumors resected 3 weeks after the end of therapy (6 weeks after the initiation of therapy) and replaced with a cortical bone allograft. Dogs with preoperative treatment were evaluated for local tumor control and time to metastasis. The mean percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma was 26.8%. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation only, IA cisplatin only, and IV cisplatin only was 81.6%, 49.1% and 23.8%, respectively. The mean percent tumor necrosis for dogs receiving radiation therapy plus IA cisplatin or radiation therapy plus IV cisplatin was 83.7% and 78.2%, respectively. There was no significant difference between percent tumor necrosis in untreated osteosarcoma compared with those receiving IV cisplatin, but there was a significant increase in percent tumor necrosis with all other treatments. A mathematic model for the effect of cisplatin and radiation dose was developed using multiple regression analysis. The radiation dose calculated to cause at least 80% tumor necrosis was 42.2 Gy (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.0 to 47.6 Gy) when radiation was given alone and 28.1 Gy (95% CI, 21.3 to 36.6 Gy) when radiation was combined with IA cisplatin. Areas of viable tumor tended to be most frequent adjacent to the articular cartilage and in the joint capsule. Percent tumor necrosis was strongly predictive for local tumor control; 28 of 32 dogs with greater than 80% tumor necrosis had local control, and only eight of 29 dogs with less than 79% tumor necrosis had local control (P = 0.0047). There was no correlation between percent tumor necrosis and time to metastasis.\r"

The changes in the glycoconjugate levels were insignificant between the controls and the normal tobacco chewers. All four parameters were significantly elevated in oral PC patients compared with controls. The levels of PBH and LSA showed significant increase in the oral PC patients compared with the normal tobacco chewers. A significant increase was observed in the levels of TSA, LSA, mucoid proteins, and PBH in OC patients compared with controls, normal tobacco chewers, and patients with oral PC. Increasing levels of all the biomarkers were found with progression of the malignant disease. Elevations in the levels of TSA and LSA were statistically significant in Stage IV patients compared with Stage III patients. The patients with metastases had higher levels of the biomarkers than the patients with primary OC. However, elevations only in LSA levels were statistically significant. These results suggest that evaluations of the serum glycoconjugate levels may be useful in diagnosis of the patients with oral PC or OC. In addition to their value in early detection, they can also help in staging of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "Flow cytometric analysis of DNA content was done on 133 primary squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx. Overall, 76 tumors (57.1%) were not diploid (aneuploid or tetraploid). The DNA index (DI) was calculated and grouped into three levels. Fifty-seven cases had a DI in a range of 1.85 to 2.15 (44 diploid and 13 tetraploid). The cases were grouped in relation to ploidy, proliferative index, and the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) system. Every group was analyzed with respect to survival rate. Ploidy was related to histocytologic grade. In well-differentiated tumors (G1) survival rates at 48 months were 41.7% in diploid cases and 27.7% in nondiploid ones (relative risk [RR], 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89, 4.52). In NO cases that underwent surgery, survival rates at 48 months were, respectively, 81.8% and 49.2% (RR, 5.07; 95% CI, 0.76, 33.93). These results suggest that ploidy may be a new independent parameter of prognosis in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. This is useful in clinical practice because it allows the clinician to recognize those cases with poorer prognosis among the early tumors at a stage where other prognostic parameters are not yet available.\r"

These were 33 patients with benign pulmonary conditions and 100 with lung cancer. The mean concentration of CA 125 was higher in patients with lung cancer (37 +/- 81 U/ml) than in those with nonmalignant disease (4.2 +/- 5.7 U/ml) (P less than 0.01). In the healthy control group CA 125 concentrations were significantly lower (0.63 +/- 1.5 U/ml) (P less than 0.001). In patients with lung cancer the concentration of this tumor marker was related to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. At a cut-off value of 15 U/ml, CA 125 had a sensitivity of 44%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 65% with respect to healthy subjects; in patients with benign pulmonary conditions, these values were 44%, 94%, 94%, and 31%, respectively. At this cut-off value, a correlation between the respectability prognosis and the likelihood of survival 24 months posttreatment was observed. These findings suggest that CA 125 can be used as an adjunctive test in the management of patients with lung cancer patients.\r"

In five cases there was evidence of preexisting synovial chondromatosis, and in the remaining three, there was a suggestion of preexisting disease. Several histologic features were found that were helpful to diagnose malignancy. The most important ones were loss of the \"clustering\" growth pattern typical of synovial chondromatosis, myxoid change in the matrix, areas of necrosis, and spindling at the periphery of chondroid lobules. Pulmonary metastasis developed in five of nine patients; three of these patients died.\r"

  ".W": "The pathologic material from 56 patients diagnosed initially as Ewing's sarcoma of the distal extremity and treated on National Cancer Institute protocols between 1968 and 1984 was reviewed and correlated with clinical outcome. Histologically, the tumors were categorized, based on recent pathologic criteria, into three diagnostic groups: (1) typical Ewing's sarcoma, (2) atypical Ewing's sarcoma, and (3) other (predominantly peripheral neuroepithelioma [PN]). Thirty-two patients (57%) had typical Ewing's, 13 (23%) were atypical, and 11 (20%) were in the \"other\" diagnostic category (seven [13%] PN, two primitive rhabdomyosarcoma, one primitive sarcoma of bone, and one synovial cell sarcoma). No cases of metastatic neuroblastoma, osteosarcoma, or lymphoma were found. Forty-five patients had localized disease at diagnosis; 11 had metastases. Patients with typical Ewing's sarcoma were less likely to have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Only two of 32 patients with typical Ewing's sarcoma had metastases compared with nine of 24 patients in the two other groups. The pattern of relapse was also different in these other groups compared with typical Ewing's patients; five patients developed lymph node metastases and two patients developed brain metastases. Although the presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis was a strong negative prognostic factor, our histologic grouping was independently prognostic of clinical outcome in patients with localized disease. Patients with typical osseous Ewing's sarcoma had an improved overall survival (P2 = 0.03) and patients with other tumors (neither typical nor atypical Ewing's sarcoma) had a poorer disease-free survival (P2 = 0.02). Since no generally accepted histopathologic prognostic criteria exist for Ewing's sarcoma, the potential value of our proposed classification should be evaluated in a larger retrospective and a prospective study.\r"

Histologically, these tumors were composed of serous acinar cells and intercalated duct-type cells. Morphologic patterns included solid, microcystic, follicular, and papillary-cystic. All patients were followed for at least 10 years or until death. Of the primary treatment group, 44% had local recurrence, 19% had metastasis, and 25% died of disease. Disease first recurred locally up to 30 years after presentation and resulted in death after as many as 38 years. Poor prognostic features include pain or fixation; gross invasion; microscopic features of desmoplasia, atypia, or increased mitotic activity; and excision as initial treatment. Neither morphologic pattern nor cell composition was a predictive feature.\r"

The study involved interviews with 57 cases and 353 controls and was restricted to men. Relative risks (RR) associated with tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and selected dietary items were obtained by unconditional logistic-regression analysis. Users of black tobacco had a RR fourfold higher than users of blond tobacco, and heavy drinkers of alcohol had a RR of 11.6. Infrequent consumption of vegetables was associated with a significant RR of 5.3, and heavy drinkers of the local infusion \"mate\" had a RR of 2.5. It was concluded that black tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking were the strongest risk factors for cancer of the tongue in Uruguay. Their effects combine according to a multiplicative model. Also, infrequent vegetable intake and mate ingestion contribute to the risk of cancer of the tongue.\r"

Prognostic factors were investigated in this group. Patients with Stage I disease had a more favorable prognosis (P less than 0.003) than those with Stages II and IV disease. The difference in prognosis was significant in cases where residual tumor was absent (P less than 0.003) and in cases where ascites was either absent or less than 100 ml in volume (P less than 0.05). Endodermal sinus tumor with either an intestinal (P less than 0.05) or microcystic pattern (P less than 0.01) was more common in survivors than in those who died. The age, preoperative serum alpha-fetoprotein level, maximum tumor size, and tumor weight had no significant correlation with prognosis. In advanced cases, chemotherapy regimens including cisplatin gave better results than those containing vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (P less than 0.05). The optimal treatment of yolk sac tumors or tumors with yolk sac tissue as a component of the ovary is discussed in light of these results.\r"

Sarcomas of bone were the most common second malignant neoplasm (SMN) reported to the Late Effects Study Group, a 13-institution consortium consisting of pediatric oncology centers from western Europe, Canada, and the United States. The authors attempted to relate the histologic subtypes of the 91 bone tumors to clinical factors such as previous therapy and genetic predisposition because morphologic variants have been shown to have biologic significance in other tumors and may have etiologic import. The literature concerning the subtypes of bone tumors, clinical and experimental, is also reviewed. The authors also investigated the effect of several factors on the time interval from the first diagnosis to the SMN (i.e., the bone sarcoma). Anthracyclines significantly shortened the interval by about 3 years. The primary diagnosis also significantly affected the interval, with leukemia/lymphomas having the shortest interval and retinoblastoma the longest. The authors could not demonstrate any significant relationship between morphologic characteristics of the osteosarcoma and predisposing conditions. However, lesions diagnosed as chondrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma occurred almost exclusively in patients who had received radiation therapy to the site in which the SMN developed.\r"

  ".U": "91091744\r", 
  ".W": "A total of 211 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (168 with tumors refractory to prior chemotherapy and 43 with no prior chemotherapy) from 33 different Southwest Oncology Group institutions had their tumors sampled and specimens shipped to two central laboratories for drug-sensitivity testing in a human tumor cloning assay. The 168 patients with a prior history of chemotherapy failure (median of four prior chemotherapeutic agents) were treated with the most effective agent(s) found in the cloning assay (23 patients), and those patients whose tumors did not form colonies in vitro or did not manifest any sensitivity to agent(s) were treated with a clinician's choice of agent(s) (101 patients). The remaining 44 of the 168 patients were not treated with chemotherapy because of deteriorating performance status or early death. The complete and partial response rate in patients treated according to assay results was 28% versus 11% for the patients treated according to clinician's choice (P = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference in survival between the two options (6.25 versus 7 months, respectively). The 43 patients with no history of prior chemotherapy were all treated with standard combination chemotherapy, and their clinical response was compared with their in vitro sensitivity to the same agents. Overall there was a 100% true-positive rate and 100% true-negative rate for the seven evaluable patients. From these data the authors conclude that use of the human tumor cloning assay may increase the response rate but not the survival for selected patients with advanced chemotherapy-refractory ovarian cancer. The study is weakened, however, by the many steps of patient selection necessitated by inadequate tumor colony formation in vitro and the inability to treat all patients (because of early death or a rapid decline in performance status). The assay does appear to be worthy of additional study for predicting response to combination chemotherapy in patients without a prior history of chemotherapy. Finally the use of central chemosensitivity testing laboratories is feasible for testing in vitro predictive assays in a cooperative group setting.\r"

Only 4.2% of the patients returned for a yearly TSE, and only 6.0% were found to follow all recommendations for monthly self examination, yearly professional examination, and sun protection. It is concluded that TSE for all new patients, and on a yearly basis for all return patients, is valuable in the detection of many skin conditions and allows skin cancer screening to be done, since patients for the most part do not follow recommendations for at-home screening.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the impact of the diagnosis and modern treatment of childhood cancer on achievement of adult goals, the authors evaluated employment, health and life insurance coverage, marriage, divorce, and reproduction in 227 former pediatric cancer patients. Each area was evaluated in relation to a common set of disease and demographic factors that included age at follow-up, age at diagnosis, gender, marital status, history of disease recurrence, and diagnosis. Patients were younger than 20 years of age at diagnosis, and their diagnoses were made between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1984. The median age at diagnosis was 11.4 years, and the median age at follow-up was 26.6 years. The percentage of unemployed male respondents did not differ from population norms. The percentage of unemployed female respondents, however, was slightly higher than that of the United States population. Approximately 11% of the survivors reported some form of employment-related discrimination, a level significantly lower than that of prior reports. Company-offered health insurance was provided to 92.4% of full-time and 90.0% of part-time employed respondents. Life insurance was purchased by 60% of full-time employed men and 55% of women. These percentages were lower than those reported for the United States population. Twenty-four percent of those with life insurance had difficulty obtaining it. Fifty-eight percent of the subjects were married or lived as married. The percentages of married men and women were significantly lower than United States norms. Twenty percent of those who were married or lived as married have divorced or separated or no longer live as married. Women aged 20 to 24 years were less likely to marry, and women aged 35 to 44 years had a significantly higher frequency of divorce than similarly aged United States women. In general, the history of childhood cancer did not influence the decision to marry or live as married but was occasionally (20%) important in the decision to dissolve a marital relationship. Many former patients indicated that their diagnosis and treatment for childhood cancer influenced their decision to have children. The current study suggests that most former pediatric cancer patients achieve adult life goals. Additional research is necessary to define those populations at greatest risk of failure to achieve these goals.\r"

Etoposide was given at 100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5 and cisplatin was given at 20 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5; therapy was recycled at 21 days with delays up to 7 days for a leukocyte count of less than 3000/microliters or a platelet count of less than 100,000/microliters. Drug doses were not attenuated for myelosuppression. Seventy-six of 82 evaluable patients achieved a complete response (CR). Seventy-two patients had a CR to chemotherapy alone. Forty-six (56%) patients had excision of residual abnormalities: 11 had teratoma in the resected specimen, 31 had necrotic debris or fibrosis, and 4 had a CR after chemotherapy plus complete excision of residual viable GCT. Six patients had an incomplete response to chemotherapy; one of these patients had unresectable mature teratoma and remains progression-free. The median etoposide dose (+/- standard deviation [SD]) was 500 mg/m2/course (+/- 35 mg/m2) and the median cisplatin dose (+/- SD) was 100 mg/m2/course (+/- 6 mg/m2). Nine patients experienced a relapse at 6 to 17.5 months; two patients with nonseminomatous GCT were salvaged by chemotherapy and one patient with seminoma was salvaged by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The three patients who were salvaged by additional therapy are disease-free at 59 to 63 months. Seventy-one patients (87%) remain disease-free with a median follow-up time of 63 months (range, 33 to 92 months). No relapses have occurred beyond 17.5 months. Etoposide and cisplatin therapy at these doses and schedule results in durable CR without late relapse.\r"

Usual side effects were mild sedation and dry mouth, but three patients found it impossible to sustain treatment due to nausea and vomiting. Most patients had significant relief of diarrhea, frequently associated with weight gain. Relief of flushing was uncommon. The therapeutic benefit produced by cyproheptadine would appear to be a peripheral effect because 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion in these patients was not reduced. Although there have been case reports of objective tumor regression with cyproheptadine therapy, this was not observed in any of these 16 patients. Cyproheptadine would appear to be a useful therapeutic tool for the management of diarrhea associated with the malignant carcinoid syndrome. An appropriate initial total daily dose is 0.4 mg/kg divided in three fractions with prompt modification to produce minimal and tolerable side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Between January 1979 and April 1983, 113 children undergoing their first relapse of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) at any site were registered in Pediatric Oncology Group study 7834; 98 were eligible and evaluable. In addition to radiotherapy administered to sites of local relapse, induction consisted of vincristine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VAP) chemotherapy. Continuation therapy consisted of triple-drug intrathecal therapy and regimens of 6-thioguanine and cytarabine alternating with vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and cytarabine. Randomization in continuation was between VAP pulses or no pulse, regardless of the site of relapse. This report provides long-term follow-up of these patients. Thirty-two of 39 children with bone marrow involvement achieved a complete response (CR). Only one of these is alive in an unmaintained remission, a child who did not have an initial CR. Thirty-four of 36 evaluable children with central nervous system involvement as the site of relapse achieved CR. Of these ten are alive; eight are in continuing CR. Nineteen of 20 boys with testicular relapse achieved CR. Of these, 14 are still alive and not receiving therapy, although only one half received treatment in compliance with the protocol described. These results illustrate the possibility of cure of patients who have relapsed with ALL when it is (1) confined to a meningeal or gonadal site and (2) treated vigorously with radiotherapy and a new regimen of systemic chemotherapy. The results reconfirm the need to prevent an initial relapse at any site.\r"

The frequency of use of the history and physical examination, complete blood count, liver function tests, carcinoembryonic antigen levels, chest x-ray, skeletal survey, bone scan, liver scan, and mammogram for observing hypothetical low- and high-risk patients was assessed. Yearly mammograms were recommended by more than 95% of respondents. History and physical examination were the modalities used most often, whereas periodic bone and liver scans were used only in a minority of patients. A review of the literature supported the strategy of the respondents in this survey and further underscored the cost-effectiveness of the history and physical examination in detecting recurrence during follow-up. Based on this survey and supporting literature, recommendations for reasonable yet cost-conscious follow-up are presented.\r"

Four hundred fifty-seven of them had a radical neck dissection (RND) at some point. Five hundred ninety patients had no clinically positive nodes (N-o) necks at the time of primary treatment; 99 of these had elective neck dissection, whereas 95 others had a delayed RND when nodes became clinically involved. Twenty-three percent of all N-o patients had microscopically involved nodes and less than half of these were among those patients selected for elective RND. Furthermore, 58% of those patients who had elective RND did not have positive nodes. Comparative analysis of elective RND, delayed therapeutic RND after clinical appearance of nodes, and composite operations for patients with N1-N3 disease indicates little difference in disease-free survival when the nodes in the elective RND were positive microscopically for tumors (56%, 49% and 47% respectively). It thus seems that elective RND offers no real advantage over a careful watchful waiting approach in most patients.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency, pattern, and time course of tumor recurrence in the breast, the outcome of 38 women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy between 1976 and 1985 was studied. Surgery typically consisted of local excision without evaluation of the microscopic margins of resection. The median radiation dose to the tumor site was 6400 cGy. With a median follow-up time of 81 months, eight patients (21%) have experienced a recurrence in the breast. The time course to recurrence was protracted in some cases, with failures occurring at 17, 27, 43, 63, 71, 83, 92, and 104 months. The 5-year and 8-year actuarial rates of tumor recurrence in the breast were 8% and 27%, respectively. Seven patients had a recurrence at or near the primary tumor site, four with invasive carcinoma, and one had an invasive recurrence at a site elsewhere in the breast. No clinical or pathologic factor was significantly associated with an increased risk of recurrence, but the number of patients in the study population was small. The authors reached the following conclusions for patients with DCIS treated with conservative surgery and radiation therapy without careful mammographic and pathologic evaluation: (1) recurrence in the breast may be seen in at least one fifth of the patients; (2) recurrence typically occurs at or near the primary site; and (3) recurrence can occur long after treatment. Careful mammographic and pathologic assessment may be useful in reducing the local recurrence rate and should be considered essential if patients are considered for conservative surgery and radiation therapy.\r"

Imprint and histologic sections were prepared from all forceps biopsy specimens. The three techniques were compared for their diagnostic sensitivity. As a result 84.9% of all imprints, 80.6% of brush biopsy specimens, and 62.9% of histologic sections were positive for malignancy. The sensitivity of brush biopsy specimens was independent of the location and morphology of the tumors, but the sensitivity of forceps biopsy specimens was lower in neoplasms unidentified by bronchoscopy. The sensitivity of the diagnostic accuracy when all three methods were used jointly was 97.3%, and the specificity was 100%. Agreement in the final morphologic tumor type was found in 130 of 150 cases (86.7%) by positive brush biopsy specimens, in 136 of 158 cases (86.1%) by positive imprint cytology, and in 104 of 117 cases (88.9%) by positive histology from forceps biopsy specimens.

  ".W": "There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal surgical management of symptomatic pericardial effusions in patients with malignancies. Subxiphoid pericardial window formation (subxiphoid pericardial drainage) has been considered a safe and effective method for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To ensure adequate drainage, many surgeons prefer the formation of a larger pericardial window by performing either an anterior thoracotomy or a partial/total pericardiectomy. To evaluate the efficacy of these methods for palliation of symptomatic pericardial effusion in patients with malignancy, 28 consecutive pericardial surgery cases involving patients with malignancy were retrospectively analyzed. Ten patients (Group 1) had subxiphoid window formation, whereas 18 patients (Group 2) had partial or total pericardiectomy or pericardial window formation by anterior thoracotomy. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.22) in the survival rates between these two groups. A median survival time of 2.67 months (range, 0.43 to 26.6 months) was observed in Group 1 versus 1.23 months (range, 0.03 to 10.83 months) in Group 2. However, a statistically significant difference (P less than or equal to 0.02) in postoperative morbidity was observed between the two groups: 67% in Group 2 versus 10% in Group 1. Because of lower morbidity, subxiphoid pericardial window formation is recommended by this study as the preferred surgical method for palliation of symptomatic pericardial effusion in patients with malignancy.\r"

However, in nine of the 14 resected specimens, viable tumor cells remained in or around the tumor. The authors suggest that small HCC are not always curable with TCE alone and that a multi-disciplinary approach is necessary for patients with small HCC.\r"

The EGF-R was faintly expressed in basal and parabasal layers of normal esophageal epithelia and in cancer nests of 20 patients; it was strongly expressed in all areas of dysplastic epithelia and in cancer nests of 18 patients. The patients with strongly expressed EGF-R had lymph node metastases more frequently, and their prognosis was poorer than those with faintly expressed EGF-R. The EGF-R expression showed a mosaic pattern in 17 patients and a diffuse pattern in 21 patients. The patients with a mosaic pattern had lymph node metastases more frequently and a worse prognosis than those with a diffuse pattern. Expression of EGF-R in metastatic lymph nodes was similar to that in strongly expressing areas of primary cancers with a mosaic pattern. Thus EGF-R expression may be an important indicator for malignancies of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas because primary cancer cells with strongly expressed EGF-R metastasize to lymph nodes more frequently.\r"

  ".W": "The Dukes' classification has well-established prognostic value in colorectal cancer patients. Yet, in each Dukes' class, the survival of individual patients may vary considerably. Recent studies show prognostic significance of genetic alterations in colorectal carcinoma. However, the importance of tumor stromal components noted in the surrounding tissue may have been overlooked by the methods used. Therefore, in a longitudinal study of 154 patients with colorectal cancer operated on between 1967 and 1974, the authors determined the influence on prognosis of lymphocytic infiltration and expression of collagen type IV in tumor stroma. Also, age, sex, Dukes' classification, grade of tumor differentiation, vasoinvasion, and the number of positive lymph nodes were analyzed. Follow-up was at least 15 years. Lymphocytic infiltration and collagen IV expression were scored as mild, moderate, or severe. Survival was analyzed by a Cox proportional-hazards model. The density of lymphocytic invasion showed no significant influence on survival. Collagen IV expression analyzed as a single variable was significantly (P = 0.038) related to better prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. By multi-variate analysis collagen IV expression showed a trend toward better prognosis that was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Dukes' classification (P less than 0.001), the presence of vasoinvasion (P = 0.009), and lymph node status (P = 0.04) significantly influenced survival. In conclusion immunohistochemistry for collagen IV is an important additional staining technique with prognostic value. In addition, collagen IV immunostaining facilitates recognition of vascular invasion by highlighting the basement membrane of vessels.\r"

One of its objectives was to modulate treatments according to risk factors to minimize the number and severity of treatment-related short-term and long-term iatrogenic complications. The NWTS has therefore incorporated a Long Term Follow-up Study (LTFS) within its framework to monitor late effects. The LTFS is confined to relapse-free survivors alive 5 years or longer after initial surgery, and data are collected using specifically designed forms. A total of 787 patients registered on NWTS-1 or NWTS-2 (1969 to 1979) were eligible, of whom 680 (86%) were available for analysis regarding musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and neuropsychologic status, and the presence of benign and malignant tumors. Patients with early-stage disease who were treated with radiation had scoliosis reported, along with other musculoskeletal abnormalities (32 versus 2), nearly seven times as often as did the members of the cohort population who did not undergo radiation (35 of 57 versus 5 of 53, respectively). The difference in cardiovascular problems recorded in survivors who did and did not receive Adriamycin (Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) (2.4 versus 1.1 per 100-person years at risk) had borderline statistical significance (P = 0.06). No excess in neuropsychologic events was reported for those given the neurotoxin vincristine. When considering patients with disease of all stages, all 5 second malignant tumors occurred in the 623 patients who underwent radiation (RT patients); benign tumors were also more frequent in RT patients than in those patients who did not undergo radiation (41 of 486 or 8% versus 4 of 194 or 2%). Continuing study of this unique body of patients is needed, especially for those given Adriamycin, because of the known long interval needed for latent cardiomyopathy to become clinically manifest in some patients.\r"

PALA, used to potentiate 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), has been shown to have synergy in vivo and in vitro. Twenty-seven patients were treated with an intravenous push dose of PALA (250 mg/m2) followed 24 hours later with a 24-hour infusion of 5-FU (2600 mg/m2). This regimen was repeated weekly. There was one partial response of 21 eligible patients with an estimated response rate of 5%. Toxicity was severe with one toxic death and four patients experiencing Grade 4 toxicity. 5-Fluorouracil and PALA, given in the schedule described, do not appear to be effective against adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.\r"

The authors conclude that 5-FU given in this moderately intensive schedule is associated with a moderate level of response, as easily achieved with more conventional schedules or with 5-FU-leucovorin combinations. Tumor responsiveness to dose intensive 5-FU regimens may be limited.\r"

  ".U": "91091770\r", 
  ".W": "Between January 1986 and September 1988, 75 patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stages IB-III) received three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), including cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate (PBM). Fifteen percent of patients achieved a complete response (CR) and 68% a partial response (PR). Pretreatment characteristics were analyzed for response to NAC. Significantly lower response rates were found in patients with tumor size more than 5 cm in diameter and bilateral parametrial involvement to the pelvic side wall. None of the biological parameters studied was related to chemoresponsiveness. Patients achieving CR or PR had a significantly improved 3-year survival rate compared with those who did not respond. After NAC, radical surgery was possible in all responding patients. The median number of lymph nodes removed was 60. A lower than expected incidence of lymph node metastases was detected. None of the clinical and pathologic features considered was significantly correlated with the lymph node status. Twelve of the 62 operated patients had disease recurrence. Pathologic parametrial involvement and cervical infiltration equal to or deeper than 5 mm were found to be significant prognostic factors for recurrence. A 3-year, disease-free survival of 89%, 73%, and 43% for Stage IB-IIA, IIB, and III, respectively, was found. Among the operated patients these rates increased to 100%, 81%, and 66% for Stage IB-IIA, IIB, and III, respectively. A prospective randomized trial comparing NAC and surgery with radiotherapy alone is in progress.\r"

Patients included in this series constituted a poor prognostic group. Seventy five percent (75%) had previous recurrences of their disease and 50% had tumors 8 cm or greater in size. In addition, 16% of the patients had gross residual disease after surgical excision and 79% had positive or close margins of resection. With a median follow-up of 5.5 years, the 5-year actuarial in-field local control rate was 75% and the overall local control rate was 66%. Four of the 12 local recurrences developed at the periphery of the implant volume and four patients failed at least 3 cm or more beyond the treated volume. After salvage therapy, the 5-year actuarial local control rate was 95%. Two patients required amputation for recurrent disease. Thirty of 34 patients remain free of disease with an excellent functional result achieved. The authors conclude that surgical resection and postoperative interstitial iridium 192 is effective therapy for patients with desmoid tumors. Despite the fact that most patients in this series had bulky, recurrent tumors, excellent long-term local control and limb function were achieved.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1986 to December 1988, a prospective trial of transcatheter arterial treatment was carried out for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two hundred seventy-five patients were included. Okuda's staging system was employed. Patients with Stage I and II HCC were treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with a gelatin sponge containing an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1a); a gelatin sponge and iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1b); or iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 2). Patients with Stage III HCC were treated with iodized oil with anti-cancer agent (protocol 2). As an exception, patients with an unsuccessful superselective catheterization into the proper hepatic artery by Seldinger technique or obstruction of the main trunk of the portal vein were treated with percutaneous transcatheter arterial infusion into the common hepatic artery regardless of stage (protocol 3). Tumor type and extension, area of tumor involvement, portal vein involvement, method of treatment, and presence of ascites and icterus were found to be the significant factors for an initial response to therapy. Treatment method was the most important factor. Respective survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 70.9% and 55.3% for protocol 1a; 62.3% and 43.8% for protocol 1b; 37.8% and 18.3% for protocol 2; and 16.5% and 0% for protocol 3. Many factors proved to significantly influenced prognosis; however, tumor type had the most important prognostic significance followed by AFP value, ascites, treatment protocol, and area of tumor involvement.\r"

No significant increase was observed in the risk of second primary cancers when all sites were combined. However, assessing on site by site basis, significant excess was noted for the rectum cancer, leukemia, and bladder cancer for the radiation therapy group but not for the surgery group. A significant excess of lung cancer was observed in both radiation therapy and surgery groups, which was attributed to some other causative factors. Radiation-induced cancers were suggested to develop apparently in organs involved in the irradiated field.\r"

The authors investigated the value of this test in 213 women with ovarian carcinoma, benign pelvic masses, benign nongynecologic diseases, and healthy controls. The MRS measurements were performed on plasma samples at 21 degrees C or 27 degrees C. The line width parameters were obtained by averaging the width at half the height of the methyl and methylene peaks on the resonance spectra. At 27 degrees C using 33 Hz as the threshold for an abnormal result, there was a significant correlation between the result of the test and the presence or absence of malignancy. However, the study demonstrates that the specificity (0.44) and positive predictive value (0.42) are too low for the test to be useful in the management of patients with carcinoma of the ovary. At 21 degrees C no correlation between the results of the test and the clinical status of women with carcinoma of the ovary were observed. In 47 patients the test did not predict preoperatively the benign or malignant nature of a pelvic mass.\r"

  ".W": "This study of 133 patients with localized prostate cancer (Stages A2 to C), treated by external beam radiation therapy (XRT), was undertaken for two reasons: (1) to investigate the usefulness of pretreatment serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in evaluating patients before XRT; and (2) to investigate post-XRT changes in PSA values and their likely clinical significance. It was found that pretreatment PSA values in patients with localized disease exhibit wide patient to patient variability with a greater than 100-fold difference between the lowest and highest values. Although mean PSA values were significantly higher in Stage C disease (51 patients; mean PSA, 17.3 ng/ml) than in Stage A2 disease (31 patients; mean PSA, 9.0 ng/ml), Stage B1 disease (23 patients; mean PSA, 9.1 ng/ml), or Stage B2 disease (28 patients; mean PSA, 10.6 ng/ml), individual values were of virtually no help in assigning individual patients to a clinical stage. PSA levels did not correlate with grade. After XRT, PSA values fell significantly and dramatically in virtually all patients (98%) by 3 months follow-up. Mean PSA fell from 12.5 to 2.6 ng/ml, and median PSA fell from 6.6 to 1.9 ng/ml. In most patients, PSA continued to fall up to 12 months after XRT and then stabilized at 21 months. Although PSA values fell dramatically after XRT, PSA was detectable in the serum of all patients. PSA values tended to transiently and mildly elevate during XRT. In a small proportion of patients, rising PSA values were observed after 6 months. The full significance of this requires further follow-up, of four such patients, one has relapsed. PSA is a more sensitive marker of prostatic radiation than prostatic acid phosphatase.\r"

Both procedures proved to be highly correlated (rs = 0.94). Ki-67-positive fractions of the nonmalignant tissues (mean, 2.1% for RC and 4.1% for HDC) were significantly lower as compared with the carcinomas (mean, 14.5% for RC and 17.5% for HDC). In carcinomas the Ki-67 labeling was significantly associated with pT stage, axillary lymph node status, and tumor grading and inversely related to progesterone receptor status. Using the medians of both counting methods (12% for RC and 17% for HDC) as cutoff points, significantly different curves for overall and disease-free survival (median follow-up, 37 months) were obtained. However, Cox multivariate analysis failed to demonstrate an independent effect of Ki-67 labeling. In contrast, Ki-67 reactivity seems to be of independent prognostic value if a higher cutoff level was selected.\r"

A computer data base was formed on presentation, containing all information required for staging according to Ho's, the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), and the American Joint Committee (AJC) classifications. The three were compared for their efficacy in predicting prognosis. Ho's classification was superior to the other two because its overall stages differed from one another more significantly in the actuarial survival (ASR), disease-free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant metastasis (FDM) rates, and its N staging was more accurate in predicting FDM. Stages T1 and T2 of UICC/AJC were similar in the freedom from local recurrence rate (FLR) and should be grouped together, equivalent to Ho's T1. A more even patients number distribution among the stages also favored the use of Ho's classification.\r"

To test this hypothesis, 26 lymphomas involving the central nervous system (CNS) (11 primary, 15 systemic) were studied for the presence of EBV. In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using a sulfur 35 (35S)-labeled EBV probe (EBV BAMH1-W). The results were interpreted without knowledge of the patients' immunologic status. The EBV sequences were detected in 11 lymphomas, nine of which were mixed or large cell subtypes. Review of the clinical information revealed that nine of the 26 lymphomas occurred in immunocompromised patients secondary to renal transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus infection, leukemia, and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. The EBV sequences were detected in all nine lymphomas occurring in immunocompromised patients, whereas two of the 17 lymphomas occurring in immunocompetent patients expressed EBV sequences. The authors conclude that the presence of EBV sequences in CNS lymphomas is highly correlated with a history of compromised immune status supporting a pathogenetic role of EBV in the development of CNS lymphomas in immunocompromised patients.\r"

All patients were treated with the M-2 protocol and clinical response was evaluated according to the criteria of the Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force. Aneuploid DNA stemlines were found in 38.2% of untreated patients with a median DNA index (DNA-I) of 1.15 in marrow aspirates and 1.22 in biopsy specimens. The median percentage of cells with abnormal DNA content was 31.5 (aspirates) and 35 (biopsy specimens) and a positive correlation with the percentage of bone marrow plasma cells was observed. Significantly higher proliferation (S-phase) was found in marrow biopsy specimens as compared with marrow aspirates. Significantly higher RNA content (RNA index [RNA-I]) was observed in aneuploid versus diploid patients in biopsy material. There was no difference in response to the Memorial Hospital M-2 protocol between diploid and aneuploid patients. In patients with DNA-I greater than 1.15 remission duration was shorter as compared with DNA-I less than or equal to 1.15. Furthermore, no difference in cellular RNA content was noted between responders and nonresponders. This study demonstrates no correlation between cellular RNA content and response, as previously described for patients treated with vincristine, Adriamycin, and dexamethasone (VAD), but DNA aneuploidy appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in MM patients treated with the M-2 protocol. It also demonstrates that prognostic models for MM are not universal but depend on the chemotherapeutic regimen used.\r"

  ".W": "Two monoclonal antibodies to progesterone receptor (PR), JZB39 and KD68, were used for the immunocytochemical visualization of PR in different kinds of breast cancer specimens including (1) cryostat sections of tumors frozen at -80 degrees C; (2) paraffin sections of tumors fixed in formalin or in Bouin's fixative for varying periods of time at room temperature or at 4 degrees C; and (3) imprints and cryostat sections prepared from the tissue used for frozen section diagnosis and stored at -80 degrees C after fixation in Zamboni's solution. Sections of conventionally frozen specimens as well as imprints and cryostat sections stored for varying periods of time were stained with the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique, whereas the avidin-biotin technique was used for paraffin sections. In all types of specimens the PR immunostaining was localized to the nuclei of carcinoma cells and displayed considerable heterogeneity both in intensity and in distribution of positive cells. Close correspondence was found between the different immunohistochemical techniques as well as between immunostaining and steroid-binding assays. PR staining was more frequently positive in well-differentiated than in moderately or poorly differentiated carcinomas, whereas no meaningful correlation was found between PR staining and extent of the disease. Similar results were obtained with the immunostaining of estrogen receptor in the same material using monoclonal antibodies H222 and D75P3 gamma. Thus, by choosing the technique that best suits the type of specimen available, it is possible to obtain valid information on the receptor status of any breast carcinoma, regardless of its size and clinical presentation.\r"

  ".W": "The current study was performed on 71 cases of human female breast cancer and compares the results of five morphologic methods developed for the detection of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PgR), lectin Peanut agglutinin (PNA) binding sites, monoclonal antibody Ki-67 immunoreactivity, and the mean number of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NOR). All the parameters were evaluated on serial cryostat sections representative of a closely related, if not identical, neoplastic population. A significant positive correlation was found between the occurrence of estrogen, progesterone, and peanut receptors and between Ki-67 immunoreactivity, mean number of NOR, and mitotic index. Furthermore, ER, PgR, and PNA receptors showed a significant, inverse correlation with Ki-67 immunoreactivity, mitotic index, and mean number of Ag-NOR. These results provide further data that support the hypothesis that (1) progesterone and PNA receptors are estrogen-induced and indicate a metabolic response of the target cells to functioning estrogen receptors; (2) the mean number of NOR reflects the cell kinetics of the tumor; and (3) metabolic differentiation of neoplastic cells is inversely correlated to the proliferation index.\r"

The reactivity with lentil lectin permitted distinction between those with HCC (31.3% +/- 14.1%) and those with uncomplicated CLD (11.2% +/- 8.4%) even when the absolute levels of serum AFP were in the same range (80-400 ng/ml).

The levels over 2 ng/ml occurred even in five of six HCC patients whose serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were below 20 ng/ml as well as in two of three patients with HCC less than 2 cm in diameter. Those levels in HCC patients were significantly decreased within 8 days after treatment with transcatheter arterial embolization or infusion of antitumor agents, without affecting plasma antithrombin III levels.

Five patients were classified as diabetic (D), two as impaired glucose tolerant (IGT), and four as nondiabetic (ND). Postabsorptive serum insulin levels (mean +/- SE, in uU/ml) in D (12 +/- 2), IGT (17 +/- 7), and ND (10 +/- 2) were comparable. After administration of 100 g of oral glucose, peak insulin achieved in D (60 +/- 11) was lower than in IGT (101 +/- 26) and ND (83 +/- 20), whereas peak insulin levels in IGT and ND were significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than in C (45 +/- 6). Comparable insulin response to nonglucose stimuli was documented in all subjects using the slow arginine infusion test with mean serum insulin of 27 +/- 4 in D, 28 +/- 6 in IGT, 34 +/- 10 in ND, and 32 +/- 5 in C. In six patients (P) and six controls, insulin action was assessed by the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, with glucose turnover rates estimated by [3-3H]glucose infusion. Steady-state plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at 92 +/- 3 (P) and 91 +/- 1 mg/dl (C). After insulin infusion at the rate of 1.0 mU/kg/min, comparable high physiologic insulin levels were observed in P (73 to 104 uU/ml) and in C (81 to 103 uU/ml). Postabsorptive rates of endogenous glucose appearance (Ra) were higher in P (2.86 to 3.02 mg/kg/min) than in C (1.50 to 2.80 mg/kg/min). At high physiologic insulin concentrations, negative Ra values were documented in all subjects, and complete suppression of Ra was assumed. Total body glucose use (M) was consistently lower in P (3.90 to 6.40 mg/kg/min) than in C (6.98 to 10.40 mg/kg/min), consistent with a state of insulin resistance. Patients with pancreatic cancer manifest insulin resistance by virtue of a decrease in total body glucose use (M) and decreased insulin response to glucose due to either inherent beta cell dysfunction or decreased islet cell mass. The latter is not identifiable by histologic morphology.\r"

Here the similarity between the tumor described here and ovarian tumors is stressed. The immunohistochemical study carried out disclosed in the nodules strong positive staining for vimentin and moderate positivity for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen. These findings, along with histologic details, favor the epithelial nature of the nodules. It was concluded that the nodules are foci of anaplastic carcinoma with high proliferative cell rate, which could explain the coexpression of vimentin and keratin.\r"

All but one patient were treated by surgery in 28 cases combined with adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. The annual incidence was 0.42/10(5). The ratio men to women was 1.1. The median age was 64 years (range, 22 to 87 years). The thigh was the most common location. The median size was 6 cm. Superficial tumors constituted 43% and were smaller than deep-seated tumors. Eighty-three tumors were storiform-pleomorphic, 53 were myxoid, and one was of inflammatory type. The myxoid tumors were smaller and more often superficial. The cumulative 5-year survival rate for all patients was 0.7, but differed markedly between the histologic types; it was 1.0 in patients with myxoid tumors and 0.5 in patients with storiform-pleomorphic tumors. In the 77 patients with storiform-pleomorphic tumors without metastases at presentation, only tumor size larger than 10 cm and tumor necrosis independently impaired survival. The 23 patients who had none of these risk factors had a 5-year survival rate of 0.8.\r"

On subsequent review, they had sinusal and diffuse growth of large pleomorphic cells that were Ber-H2 (Ki-1; CD 30) positive. One case marked as a T-cell lymphoma with UCHL1, one case expressed T-cell and B-cell markers, and one case was negative for both T-cell and B-cell markers. All patients received chemotherapy, and two received local radiation. One patient was not treated until 9 years after initial diagnosis. Two patients had several recurrences, but there has been no evidence of lymphoma in any of the three patients for 63 to 301 months; overall survival time has ranged from 14 to 25 years. These cases are the longest reported survivors with Ki-1 lymphoma; 5 years was the longest survival time previously reported. It also is noteworthy that Ber-H2 and other lymphoid-associated antigens appear to be preserved in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues for prolonged periods. This may allow retrospective studies to evaluate the natural history of Ki-1 lymphomas, as well as their spontaneous or treatment-induced regression.\r"

Weight and Quetelet Index (kg/m2) were significantly (P = 0.001) associated with lymph node involvement in postmenopausal patients. The abdomen:thigh skinfold ratio was significantly higher in premenopausal patients (P = 0.004) and postmenopausal (P = 0.03) without axillary node involvement compared with women with 4+ axillary node involvement. The abdomen:thigh skinfold was higher (P = 0.05) in women with smaller breast cancers (less than 2.0 cm) and higher ER levels. Weight and Quetelet Index did not affect tumor size or ER level. This study demonstrated that obese postmenopausal women who developed breast cancer tend to have more axillary node involvement than their leaner counterparts. Generalized obesity did not affect tumor size or ER level. Premenopausal and postmenopausal women with upper body fat distribution appear to be a subset of women who have a more favorable prognosis as measured by less lymph node involvement, smaller tumors, and higher levels of ER in their tumors.\r"

For these tumor diameter groups a six-fold eliminatory curability analysis was performed. Of the patients with liver metastases in group 1 the last patient had died at 10 months and in groups 2 and 3 no patients were alive at 18 months after the start of complaints. Patients with extrahepatic metastases did not survive 12 months in group 1, 16 months in group 2, and 25 months in group 3. The 6% actuarial survival rate for inoperable patients was reached in group 1 after 17 months, in group 2 after 36 months, and in group 3 after 27 months after the start of complaints. For groups 1 through 3 in curable, but not curatively operated patients, the respective 0% actuarial survival rate was reached at 24 months, 23 months, and 14 months. The 0% actuarial survival rate in patients with irresectable vessel invasion was reached in group 1 at 33 months, in group 2 at 23 months, and in group 3 at 25 months. The 0% actuarial survival rate in patients with an irresectable tumor was reached at 33 months, 31 months, and 27 months after the start of complaints in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The 0% actuarial survival rate in curatively operated patients was reached in group 3 after 26 months and in group 2 after 29 months. In group 1 25% of the patients were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints. Small tumors were associated with the greatest chance of curative operation and on average had the longest survival. However, small tumors with liver or other metastases carried a worse prognosis than large tumors with liver or other metastases. If tumors were found not to be resectable at the time of operation, the size of the tumor did not appear to affect survival.\r"

Point estimates of relative risk associated with smoking variables, ingestion of infusions of the herb Ilex paraguariensis (mate), and selected dietary items were obtained by stratified and logistic regression analysis. Among men, smokers of black tobacco showed a relative risk (RR) 2.7 higher than blond tobacco smokers and mate exposure showed a significant dose-response, after adjustment for age, residence, social class, hospital, type of tobacco, smoking intensity, smoking duration, and vegetable consumption, with a seven-fold increase in risk for heavy consumers. Joint exposure to type of tobacco and mate consumption showed a multiplicative effect. Women showed a similar increase in risk with mate consumption. The results suggest that the high mortality rates of bladder cancer observed in Uruguay could be explained by the combined effect of black tobacco smoking and mate ingestion.\r"

  ".W": "The authors prospectively studied 113 consecutive patients with deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities to determine the most appropriate workup study for searching for a hidden cancer. After a careful physical examination, the following routine tests were performed: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), whole blood counts, biochemistry, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, chest radiograph, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan. If a malignant lesion was suspected, further appropriate studies were performed. After discharge, periodic follow-up was performed on all patients in the outpatient clinic. A malignant neoplasm was detected in 12 patients. Of these 12 patients, six were asymptomatic with the exception of experiencing thrombophlebitis. Cancer was found more commonly in patients with idiopathic deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (7 of 31 versus 5 of 82 patients with secondary DVT; P = 0.012), and in those patients with abnormal lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (6 of 23 versus 6 of 90; P = 0.007). Abnormal CEA levels allowed diagnosis of two cases of colonic cancer (on colonoscopy). Both ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen showed two cases of urinary bladder carcinoma at a very early stage. Furthermore, two cases of adenomatous polyps in colon were found, a condition considered by most authors to be a colorectal cancer precursor. In addition, there were five patients with large benign pelvic tumors, and two patients with absent inferior vena cava. The most striking finding was that some cases of cancer were at a very early stage. It was concluded that blood cell counts, LDH, CEA, chest radiograph, and abdominal ultrasonography (or CT scan) should be routinely performed on all patients with deep venous thrombosis (particularly those with idiopathic DVT). Malignancy would not have been recognized in some patients if these tests had not been performed.\r"

  ".W": "Eight patients with metastatic carcinoid tumor, seven of whom had symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome, were treated with either human leukocyte interferon (seven patients) or recombinant alpha-interferon (IFN alpha-2b) (one patient) at doses of 4.5 to 21 x 10(6) IU weekly for 1 to 21 (mean, 8.5) months. Tumor regression on computed tomography (CT) scan was found in one patient, the CT findings remained unchanged in three, and the tumor progressed in four patients. A clearcut and continuing decrease in urinary levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) was observed in one patient and a transient one in four patients. The symptoms improved in only two of seven patients. Four patients had leukopenia develop, which was circumvented by reducing the dose. The authors conclude that interferon therapy of the carcinoid tumor is not as successful as has been suggested in previous reports.\r"

  ".U": "91091799\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred six children with newly diagnosed non-T-, non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated in a Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) pilot study in which six courses of intermediate-dose methotrexate (MTX) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (1 g/m2 each) were added to a \"backbone\" of standard continuation therapy. The dose and sequence of MTX/Ara-C administration were based on a preclinical model that demonstrated synergism between MTX and Ara-C. Poor-risk patients (n = 49) were assigned to \"up-front\" therapy, in which the MTX/Ara-C courses were administered during the initial 15 weeks of remission. Standard-risk patients (n = 57) were assigned to \"spread-out\" therapy, in which the MTX/Ara-C courses were interspersed at 12-week intervals within continuation treatment. Toxicity after intermediate-dose MTX/Ara-C, principally neutropenia and fever, was judged significant but manageable. Unexpectedly, the incidence of fever and neutropenia less than 500/mm3 was greater after \"spread-out\" therapy (38%) than after \"up-front\" therapy (6%). At 4 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of event-free survival (EFS) is 71% (+/- 7%) for standard-risk patients and 53% (+/- 8%) for poor-risk patients. The results of this pilot study support the use of intermediate-dose MTX/Ara-C in additional studies.\r"

  ".W": "Orbital rhabdomyosarcoma accounts for one-fourth of the primary tumors in the head and neck region. Modern treatment modalities have led to a 2-year survival rate of about 90% in these patients. However, new therapeutic trials are designed to reduce complications and salvage more than 90% of orbital cases. Between 1979 and 1990, 12 children affected by primary orbital rhabdomyosarcoma have been diagnosed and treated at the University of Naples. Ten of them have been uniformly treated by biopsy, followed by immediate radiation and combined chemotherapy. All 12 patients are alive and free of detectable disease, from a minimum of 7 months to a maximum of 123 months after diagnosis. In all children, ocular structures have been spared and the complications observed until now have been few. The above results suggest that the association of immediate radiation therapy and chemotherapy might represent an optimal tool for treatment of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1981, 20 patients with anaplastic giant cell carcinoma of the thyroid have been prospectively treated according to a combination regimen of chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. Two types of chemotherapy were used every 4 weeks, depending on the patient's age. For those younger than 65 years, a combination of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2) was given, and for older patients mitoxantrone (14 mg/m2) was used. Radiotherapy was carried out between Day 10 and Day 20 of the first four cycles of chemotherapy. It delivered 17.5 Gy in 7 fractions to the neck and the superior mediastinum. Survival exceeding 20 months was observed in three patients. Complete neck tumor response was observed in five patients, among whom four had undergone previous operations. No response was seen in distant metastases, which were the cause of death in 14 patients. These treatment modalities are effective in some patients, both in terms of survival and of local control, avoiding death from local invasion. Gross tumor resection should be performed whenever possible but should not delay the commencement of this protocol. Toxicity was high and remains the main limiting factor.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred eighty-one children with Wilms' tumor were treated in the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group WT1 Study (1982 to 1986). Seventy-one patients had relapses during or after treatment with surgery and chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, depending on stage and histologic characteristics. Forty-nine patients were evaluable for disease response to second-line chemotherapy alone. Evaluation of response to chemotherapy was impossible in the remaining patients because either surgery or radiation therapy was used at the time of relapse. With second-line combination chemotherapy (which included ifosfamide, etoposide/VM26, cisplatin/carboplatin, bleomycin, melphalan, and Thiotepa [Lederle Laboratories, Pearl River, NY]), there were five complete responses and 12 partial responses. In patients with favorable histologic findings, six of nine with Stage I, five of ten with Stage II, none of 11 with Stage III, three of 16 with Stage IV, and one of five with Stage V disease survived. Two survivors were treated with chemotherapy alone; the others received combined treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. For those with unfavorable histologic findings of any stage, only two of 20 survived. The authors conclude that, even for patients with localized disease with favorable histologic findings, the \"salvage\" rate is little more than 50%, and for all other stages and histologic findings the likelihood of cure after relapse is remote. There is clearly a need for additional effective chemotherapeutic agents for these patients.\r"
