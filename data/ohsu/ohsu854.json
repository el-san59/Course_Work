  ".W": "The radionuclide bone scan is the most effective whole body screening test for bone metastases. Conventional radiography, although relatively insensitive to the presence of bone metastases, is the best modality for characterizing them once they are detected in radionuclide scans. When the radionuclide bone scan and appropriate correlative radiographs are analyzed and reported together, false-positive scan findings are reduced, and scan specificity is increased. Valuable information on response to treatment may be obtained by correlating the changes seen in radiographs and radionuclide bone scans. CT or MR imaging may be useful for evaluating suspicious radionuclide bone scan findings that cannot be explained radiographically, and may influence the decision regarding the need for biopsy. CT can also be used to monitor needle-biopsy procedures. The use of CT or MR imaging is helpful in determining the local extent of metastatic disease when planning palliative surgery or radiotherapy. Although a positive diagnosis by needle biopsy is considered definitive, a negative result must be suspect and may eventually necessitate open surgical biopsy. An algorithmic approach to the workup of a possible skeletal metastasis is illustrated in Figure 12.\r"

  ".W": "Several immunologically distinct isozymes of inositol phospholipid-specific phospholipase C (PLC) have been purified from bovine brain. Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were found to express PLC-gamma, but the expression of PLC-beta was barely detectable by radioimmunoassay or protein immunoblot. A mixture of monoclonal antibodies was identified that neutralizes the biological activity of both endogenous and injected purified PLC-gamma. When co-injected with oncogenic Ras protein or PLC-gamma, this mixture of antibodies inhibited the induction of DNA synthesis that characteristically results from the injection of these proteins into quiescent 3T3 cells. However, when oncogenic Ras protein or PLC-gamma was co-injected with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to Ras, only the DNA synthesis induced by the Ras protein was inhibited--that induced by PLC was unaffected. These results suggest that the Ras protein is an upstream effector of PLC activity in phosphoinositide-specific signal transduction and that PLC-gamma activity is necessary for Ras-mediated induction of DNA synthesis.\r"

The SPB4 protein belongs to a family of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent RNA helicases. The aberrant production of 25S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) occurring in spb4-1 mutants or the deletion of SPB2 (RPL46) permits the deletion of PAB1. These data suggest that mutations affecting different steps of 60S subunit formation can allow PAB-independent translation, and they indicate that further characterization of the spb mutations could lend insight into the biogenesis of the ribosome.\r"

Analysis of tyrosine kinase activity and quantitative measurement of transformation potency in a single-step assay indicate that variation in bcr exon contribution results in a functional difference between p210bcr-abl and p185bcr-abl proteins. Thus, foreign upstream sequences are important in the deregulation of the kinase activity of the abl product, and the extent of deregulation correlates with the pathological effects of the bcr-abl proteins.\r"

Our recent experience with this entity is described, and 153 cases reported in the English-language literature are reviewed and summarized. The majority of cases occurs as a consequence of civilian violence among men in their 20s and 30s. Most bullet emboli follow the direction of blood flow, although 15% of venous bullets cause embolization in a retrograde manner. One in 10 arterial emboli follow a right-heart or venous injury. Arterial bullets are symptomatic in 80% of cases, venous bullets in only one third. The choice of surgical management must be individualized according to the symptoms caused by the bullet and its location in the vascular system. In general, arterial bullet emboli are removed because of symptoms or findings of acute peripheral ischemia. Arterial and venous emboli not causing symptoms should be removed according to the risk of possible displacement and further embolization. Selective intraoperative angiograms and phlebograms can precisely localize the migrating bullet and permit appropriate placement of incisions before removal.\r"

All cerebrovascular amyloid deposits in these 46 cases were consistently immunoreactive to anti-beta protein antibody. However, in nine cases some vascular walls with strong beta protein immunoreactivity also reacted less intensely with the anti-cystatin C antiserum. Of these nine cases, seven showed relatively heavy cerebrovascular amyloid deposition, and all seven had suffered a fatal subcortical hemorrhage presumably caused by cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Previous limited studies have suggested that the amyloid protein seen in elderly individuals with cerebral amyloid angiopathy is composed of beta protein. However, subcortical hemorrhage rarely occurs in such individuals. Our study shows that aged patients with different brain disorders commonly suffer from beta protein-type cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and we also suggest that the severity of beta protein-type cerebrovascular amyloid deposition is a fundamental factor in cerebral amyloid angiopathy-induced brain hemorrhage in the elderly. The nature of the cystatin C-immunoreactive substance in some of these vascular lesions is uncertain, but it might conceivably play an additional important role in the pathogenesis of brain hemorrhage in these cases.\r"

Signals designating emboli were transients displaying harmonic qualities the signatures of which were clearly different from those of mechanical and electronic artifacts. We reviewed the audio/video tape recordings from 91 patients for signals of air bubble emboli occurring upon release of common carotid artery crossclamps; recordings from 35 patients (38%) demonstrated air bubble emboli. Transients with signatures identical to those of air bubble emboli were also discovered when bubbles in the bloodstream were improbable; we defined these transients as representing formed-element emboli. Such signals were found in recordings from 24 patients (26%), and they occurred before (both spontaneously and upon common carotid artery compression), during, and after surgical dissection. Signals indicating formed-element emboli were associated with intraluminal platelet thrombus, with ulcerations in the carotid artery, and with transient ischemic attacks or stroke. Most postoperative formed-element emboli did not cause symptoms but, when persisting for hours, they were associated with strokes and cerebral infarction. This Doppler ultrasound method of detecting emboli will be useful in the study of stroke mechanisms and as a clinical test to guide the medical and surgical treatment of patients at risk of stroke.\r"

  ".W": "We used laser-Doppler flowmetry to study the effects of endothelin-1 on local cortical microvascular perfusion and resistance in 29 pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. Intravenous administration of 10-300 pmol endothelin-1 reduced arterial blood pressure and microvascular resistance and increased microvascular perfusion. However, intracarotid administration of low doses of endothelin-1 increased microvascular perfusion and reduced microvascular resistance and arterial blood pressure, whereas high doses (greater than or equal to 300 pmol) reduced microvascular perfusion and increased microvascular resistance and arterial blood pressure. Only the high dose/low flow response was associated with attenuation of the electrocorticogram. The low dose/high flow and high dose/low flow responses to endothelin-1 were not altered by blockade of muscarinic and adrenergic receptors. In addition, systemic metabolic changes (arterial pH, PaCO2, PaO2, and plasma glucose concentration) did not account for the cerebrovascular effects of endothelin-1. Platelet hyperaggregability also did not appear to be a causative factor in the high dose/low flow response to endothelin-1. In fact, ex vivo rat platelet aggregation was inhibited by intracarotid administration of 300 pmol endothelin-1. In conclusion, the cerebral vasculature exhibits extreme sensitivity to the vasodilator properties of endothelin-1 at low doses. The ischemic vasoconstrictor effects observed at high doses implicate endothelin-1 as an important mediator of cerebral vasospasm and/or postischemic hypoperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "We identified 60 patients (42 men and 18 women with an average age of 62.6 years) with angiographically documented carotid stenoses of greater than or equal to 95%; a string sign was demonstrated in 28. Twenty of the 60 patients (33%) were asymptomatic on presentation, 26 (43%) had hemispheric transient ischemic attacks, 21 (35%) had amaurosis fugax, and nine (15%) had previous ipsilateral infarctions. Demographics, mode of presentation, and prevalence of atherosclerotic risk factors were not significantly different between patients with and without a string sign. Doppler frequencies recorded in patients with a string sign were less than 6 or greater than 16 KHz. Real-time ultrasonography imaged a patent lumen in all but three cases with a string sign. Surgery was performed in 26 patients with a string sign and in 21 patients without a string sign. The rate of major perioperative complications was not influenced by the presence of a string sign, contralateral extracranial stenosis, or ipsilateral siphon stenosis. Average lumen size of the endarterectomy specimens was 0.94 mm in those with and 1.7 mm in those without a string sign. We conclude that combined noninvasive testing has a sensitivity of 83% for demonstrating a residual lumen in patients with greater than or equal to 95% carotid stenosis and that the angiographic string sign does not affect the mode of presentation or surgical outcome of these patients.\r"

Unassisted systoles had normal blood velocities and waveforms. When the pump was in use, diastolic blood velocity during balloon inflation increased. As the balloon was deflated and intra-aortic pressure was dramatically lowered, diastolic blood velocity within the intracranial vessels decreased sharply. In two patients there was a reversal of blood flow in the middle cerebral, anterior cerebral, basilar, and vertebral arteries during late diastole. Although the clinical effects of cessation and reversal of blood flow in the cerebral circulation while on an intra-aortic balloon pump remain to be determined, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography appears to be a useful tool for measuring these hemodynamic effects. It may also be helpful in quantifying the effects of such pumps on cerebral blood flow and devising inflation/deflation timing sequences that maximize forward blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "Chromium has been implicated as a cofactor in the maintenance of normal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. A deficiency of chromium results from diets low in biologically available chromium. Picolinic acid, a metabolite of tryptophan, forms stable complexes with transitional metal ions, which results in an improved bioavailability of the metal ion chromium. To determine whether or not chromium picolinate is effective in humans, 28 volunteer subjects were given either chromium tripicolinate (3.8 micromol [200 micrograms] chromium) or a placebo daily for 42 days in a double-blind crossover study. A 14-day period off capsules was used between treatments. Levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, the principal protein of the LDL fraction, decreased significantly while the subjects were ingesting chromium picolinate. The concentration of apolipoprotein A-I, the principal protein of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction, increased substantially during treatment with chromium picolinate. The HDL-cholesterol level was elevated slightly but not significantly during ingestion of chromium picolinate. Only apolipoprotein B, of the variables measured, was altered significantly during supplementation with the placebo. These observations show that chromium picolinate is efficacious in lowering blood lipids in humans.\r"

Because of its potential adverse vasoconstrictive effects, norepinephrine usually has been chosen only when all other drugs have failed in septic shock. However, several recent reports have suggested a beneficial effect of norepinephrine, often in doses higher than those commonly used. Specifically, these studies in 77 patients showed that norepinephrine effectively elevates blood pressure and increases systemic vascular resistance without decreasing cardiac output. Renal function in these patients appears to be maintained. Information on oxygen transport is variable; however, the mortality from sepsis remains high at between 17 and 50 percent. Until more information becomes available, norepinephrine appears to be a useful drug in maintaining blood pressure in patients with septic shock, but higher than usual doses may be needed.\r"

Clinical trials report efficacy equal to that of hydralazine, diuretics, beta-blockers, and other calcium-channel blockers such as nifedipine, verapamil, and isradipine. Nitrendipine has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in that it is well absorbed and has a half-life long enough to allow once-daily administration in some patients. However, considerable variation observed with some pharmacokinetic parameters has consequently delayed marketing approval by the Food and Drug Administration. Adverse effects are generally mild and transient, and result from nitrendipine's vasodilatory properties. Nitrendipine may increase digoxin plasma concentrations in some patients, but this may not be clinically significant. Other studies are required to ascertain which drugs interact with nitrendipine. In summary, nitrendipine is safe and effective for treatment of hypertension, and because of its longer duration of action as well as lack of metabolic side effects, may provide an alternative to the present antihypertensive armamentarium.\r"

Accordingly, the outcome of 108 patients who experienced either ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation during coronary angiography between 1975 and 1979 in the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) Registry were examined. There were 20,142 patients analyzed. Patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias had more objective evidence of left ventricular impairment, clinical heart failure, and ventricular arrhythmia recorded as a clinical symptom. The overall 5-year survival rates were 83% and 88% for patients with and without ventricular tachyarrhythmias, respectively (p = 0.07). When ventricular function, age, gender, angina, and previous myocardial infarction were added in a stepwise Cox survival analysis, the presence of arrhythmias was not significant (p = 0.66). At 5 years, 80% of the medically treated patients and 82% of the surgically treated patients remained alive (p = 0.95). The only statistically significant differences in the patients with ventricular arrhythmias who were treated medically or surgically were age (medically treated patients 52 +/- 10 years, surgical patients 57 +/- 9 years, p = 0.01) and number of diseased vessels (p less than 0.001). In a stepwise Cox survival analysis, functional impairment secondary to congestive heart failure was the only significant covariate to affect survival in the medical and surgical groups (p = 0.0001). Surgical therapy itself was not significant (p = 1.00). The incidence of sudden death during 5 years for patients with and without ventricular tachyarrhythmias during catheterization was 5% and 4%, respectively (p = 0.28).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The 12-lead ECG remains a simple and inexpensive technique to diagnose AMI in its early phases. The diagnostic accuracy of the ECG depends upon the extent of myocardial necrosis and its localization. The ECG is most sensitive in patients with occlusion of the LAD artery, followed by the RCA and the left CFA. In 10% to 20% of patients with AMI the initial ECG either shows nonspecific changes or is normal. The correlation between the ECG and infarct-related artery varies according to the involved vessel. Classic ECG changes are seen in 90% of the LAD artery, in 70% to 80% of RCA, and in only 50% of CFA occlusions. A second important issue is the mechanism and clinical significance of reciprocal ST segment changes, which usually indicate larger MI, more impaired ventricular function, worse prognosis, and in some patients, significant disease of a noninfarct-related artery. Furthermore, the value of the ECG in estimating myocardial injury and infarct size remains controversial. The ECG plays an important role in coronary reperfusion. ST segment elevation is one of the principal criteria for instituting thrombolytic therapy, and helps predict those who will most likely benefit from coronary reperfusion. The role of the ECG in evaluating the reperfusion status after coronary thrombolysis is not clear. Rapid return to baseline or normalization of the ST segment suggests opening of the occluded vessel, though a small or negligible change does not exclude successful reperfusion.\r"

Over the past decade, several randomized clinical trials have been undertaken to help clarify the appropriate use of the cardiac glycosides in these patients. Although the data are not conclusive, the available evidence indicates that digoxin is efficacious and relatively safe in patients with CHF whether given alone or in combination with vasodilators. Ongoing myocardial ischemia, hypokalemia and reduced drug clearance due to renal disease or drug interactions remain the clinical parameters most closely associated with digitalis toxicity. However, the recent introduction and widespread availability of a safe and rapidly effective antidote to digitalis preparations--Fab fragments of antidigoxin antibodies--offers the clinician a greater margin of safety in the use of the cardiac glycosides than has been available in the past.\r"

  ".U": "90177924\r", 
  ".W": "Many of the electrolyte derangements seen in chronic heart failure are related to activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Activation of the system may cause the retention of both sodium and water; the former is primarily related to the release of aldosterone and the latter is related to an angiotensin-mediated increase in thirst and decrease in the excretion of free water. The interaction of these mechanisms may explain why patients with chronic heart failure have higher values for total body sodium but lower values for serum sodium concentration than hypertensive patients or normal subjects. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may also cause potassium depletion, which is manifest clinically by a decrease in both total body potassium and serum potassium concentration. These electrolyte disturbances may play a role in the development of ventricular arrhythmias. The renin-angiotensin system may also contribute to the development of magnesium deficits. These hormone-electrolyte interactions have important implications in the treatment of patients with heart failure, especially those in whom the renin-angiotensin system is pharmacologically inhibited.\r"

Hypokalemia has been associated with an increased frequency of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) in some studies of hypertensive patients treated with diuretics, but other studies have failed to confirm any association. Studies involving patients with an acute myocardial infarction have also provided conflicting data about the association between hypokalemia and VPCs. Whereas the role of potassium in the genesis of simple VPCs remains uncertain, animal and clinical studies have demonstrated a strong relation between hypokalemia and the occurrence of sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during acute ischemic states. Hypokalemia may also affect the action of antiarrhythmic drugs by altering the electrophysiologic properties of the myocardium, potentially negating some of the antiarrhythmic activity of these agents. Although diuretic use is the most frequent cause of hypokalemia, epinephrine can also lower serum potassium as a result of stimulation of the beta 2 adrenoreceptor. This mechanism may, in part, explain the ability of beta blockers to prevent sudden death in patients with a recent myocardial infarction.\r"

Disturbances of potassium balance are common in patients taking diuretics; indeed, the potential number of people in this country at risk of diuretic-related hypokalemia approaches 9 million. The magnitude of this problem is of particular concern, because of the compelling data that link hypokalemia in such patients to electrical instability of the heart and to a fatal outcome after an acute cardiac injury. Therefore, aggressive correction of hypokalemia is warranted in patients with cardiovascular disorders.\r"

  ".U": "90177927\r", 
  ".W": "Prehistoric animals and humans consumed a diet low in sodium but high in potassium, and thus, evolutionary forces fostered the development of physiologic systems that conserved sodium and excreted potassium. With the advent of civilized societies, food cooking and processing have greatly increased the sodium but decreased the potassium content of the diet. However, there has been little time for physiologic systems to adapt. The resulting excess of sodium has been implicated as an important factor in the development of hypertension and congestive heart failure. This traditional focus on sodium has ignored the potential role that an inadequate dietary intake of potassium might play in the degenerative diseases of the heart, brain and kidney. Yet dietary potassium may be as powerful a determinant of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as dietary sodium. In experimental and clinical hypertension, an increased intake of potassium (without a change in dietary sodium) can reduce blood pressure, may suppress the activity of the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems, and can prevent the development of vascular injury; conversely, potassium depletion has been associated with an increase in stroke and sudden death. In patients with chronic heart failure, potassium can modify both the mechanical and electrical properties of the heart, it can exert diuretic effects, and it can reduce the frequency and complexity of potentially lethal ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Given this central role, the effects of many pharmacologic interventions on the morbidity and mortality of patients with hypertension or chronic heart failure can be enhanced or diminished by the effect that these treatments might have on potassium homeostasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After 3 months of follow-up, 1,546 of the 2,466 patients enrolled had a 24-hour continuous electrocardiographic recording that contained greater than or equal to 12 hours of analyzable data. They were similar to the patients who survived 3 months but chose not to have a 24-hour electrocardiographic recording (i.e., they were representative of the entire group that survived 3 months). After 3 months of follow-up, there were no significant differences between the diltiazem and placebo groups in the prevalence of atrioventricular block, the frequency of atrial arrhythmias or the frequency or repetitiveness of ventricular arrhythmias. Heart rate was significantly lower (67 +/- 12 vs 71 +/- 12 beats/min) and there was a significantly greater proportion of patients with sinus pauses greater than or equal to 2 seconds in duration in the diltiazem group (6%) than in the placebo group (3%). Comparison with placebo revealed no evidence either for an anti- or proarrhythmic effect of diltiazem. There was no reduction in sudden or arrhythmic death attributable to diltiazem treatment; the fraction of total deaths that were arrhythmic by the Hinkle classification was 41% in the placebo group and 42% in the diltiazem group. It may be that the lack of effect of diltiazem on ventricular arrhythmias is partially responsible for its lack of effect on mortality after myocardial infarction.\r"

HR was examined on admission at maximum level in the coronary care unit, and at hospital discharge. Both in-hospital and postdischarge mortality increased with increasing admission HR, and total mortality (day 2 to 1 year) was 15% for patients with an admission HR between 50 and 60 beats/min, 41% for HR greater than 90 beats/min and 48% for HR greater than or equal to 110 beats/min. Mortality from hospital discharge to 1 year was similarly related to maximal HR in the coronary care unit and to HR at discharge. In patients with severe heart failure (grade 3 or 4 pulmonary congestion on chest x-ray, or shock), cumulative mortality was high regardless of the level of admission HR (range 61 to 68%). However, in patients with pulmonary venous congestion of grade 2, cumulative mortality for patients with admission HR greater than or equal to 90 beats/min was over twice as high as that in patients with admission HR less than 90 beats/min (39 vs 18%, respectively); the same trend was evident in patients with absent to mild heart failure (mortality 18 vs 10%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All patients had chest pain and greater than or equal to 1 mm of ST-segment depression during the baseline placebo exercise test. After 10 weeks of active treatment, 55% of the patients were free of chest pain during maximal exercise (difference not significant between treatments). In the betaxolol 40 mg/day group, fewer (6 of 19; 32%) of the patients developed ST-segment depression with exercise (p less than 0.05) compared with propranolol 80 mg 4 times daily (21 of 26; 81%). Betaxolol appears to be a useful once-a-day cardioselective beta blocker for the therapy of angina pectoris.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of cardiac arrest is increased during strenuous physical exercise in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Because premonitoring symptoms are rarely observed, silent myocardial ischemia may represent the pathophysiological basis for the induction of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Holter monitoring was, therefore, performed in 40 consecutive patients entering a randomized intervention trial on progression of CAD. In 20 of 21 participants (95%) in the intervention program greater than or equal to 1 episode of silent myocardial ischemia was observed during the initial training session. The mean duration of silent myocardial ischemia per patient was 25 +/- 13 min/hr of training session. During normal daily activity only 5 patients (24%) experienced greater than or equal to 1 episode of silent myocardial ischemia (p less than 0.001) yielding a mean duration of 0.6 +/- 1.3 minutes of silent myocardial ischemia/hr of ordinary activity per patient (p less than 0.001 vs training session). During a control period of 24 hours without exercise training the incidence (33%) and mean duration of silent myocardial ischemia (0.8 +/- 2.1 min/hr/patient) were similar to those during normal daily activity on the day of the training session. During the training session the occurrence of frequent or repetitive ventricular arrhythmias was related to 10 silent myocardial ischemia episodes detected in 5 patients. During normal daily activity in 1 patient only was the onset of malignant ventricular arrhythmias associated with silent myocardial ischemia (p less than 0.05). Conditions and results of the Holter studies in the control group patients were comparable to those of the patients in the intervention group on the day without physical exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With the advent of lower recommended dosages, the effect of hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg daily alone and in combination with the potassium-sparing drug, amiloride 5 mg, on the frequency and severity of ventricular arrhythmias was examined in 37 elderly patients. The mean age was 81 +/- 2 years. The study used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design with 3 treatment phases: hydrochlorothiazide, hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride and placebo. A 24-hour Holter monitor recording and serum potassium measurement were obtained at the end of each treatment. Mean serum potassium was significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced with hydrochlorothiazide (3.5 +/- 1 mEq/liter) compared with placebo (4.1 +/- 0.1) and hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride (4.1 +/- 0.1). Serious ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 13 of 37 patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide compared with 15 of 37 receiving placebo and 9 of 37 receiving hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride. Patients who exhibited ventricular ectopy during the placebo phase tended to have an increase in the number of ventricular premature complexes receiving hydrochlorothiazide, although the difference was not statistically significant. There was a significant (p = 0.045) difference in the hourly ventricular premature complex frequency for hydrochlorothiazide compared with hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride. Patients with hypokalemia did not exhibit greater ventricular ectopic activity than those with a normal serum potassium, and concurrent digoxin therapy did not affect arrhythmia occurrence. Hydrochlorothiazide, 50 mg daily, did not affect the frequency or severity of ventricular ectopic activity in this elderly population.\r"

  ".W": "High-dose intravenous amiodarone was given to 35 patients with recurrent life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT) refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic agents. Intravenous amiodarone was given as a 5 mg/kg dose over 30 minutes followed by 20 to 30 mg/kg/day as a constant infusion for 5 days. Twenty-two (63%) patients responded to intravenous amiodarone. All 22 responders received oral amiodarone. Thirteen (59%) continue to receive oral amiodarone after an average follow-up of 19 months, 4 (18%) had sudden cardiac death on oral amiodarone, 2 (9%) died while receiving amiodarone, secondary to left ventricular failure, and 3 (14%) discontinued amiodarone because of side effects. Of the 13 (37%) nonresponders, 10 died in the hospital while receiving intravenous amiodarone, secondary to lethal arrhythmia. Three nonresponders were discharged from the hospital; 2 with automatic cardioverter/defibrillators and 1 receiving a combination of antiarrhythmic agents. Serious adverse events occurred in 13 (37%) patients during intravenous amiodarone therapy. These included hypotension in 8 patients, symptomatic bradycardia in 4 patients and sinus arrest with bradycardia and hypotension in 1 patient. Minor side effects occurred in 23 (66%) patients. In conclusion, high dose intravenous amiodarone is effective in most patients with recurrent, sustained VT but is associated with an unacceptably high incidence of serious adverse events. The optimal dose and duration of intravenous amiodarone for patients with recurrent, refractory sustained VT remain unknown.\r"

Modulation of the plasma noradrenaline response to submaximal exercise should be desirable. The long-term (9 weeks) effects of milrinone (10 mg 4 times a day) or captopril (50 mg 3 times a day) compared to placebo were evaluated in a double-blind crossover study, in 16 patients with stable, congestive heart failure receiving digoxin and furosemide. After treatment, clinical status (score range 0 to 14 points) improved significantly with both milrinone (4.4 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.01) and captopril (4.1 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.01). Plasma noradrenaline at rest was similar with both drugs and not significantly different from placebo. During submaximal exercise it increased significantly to 1,228 +/- 58 pg/ml with placebo and to 1,295 +/- 174 pg/ml with milrinone; this response was reduced significantly with captopril, to 820 +/- 100 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Thus, long-term therapy with both captopril and milrinone improved the clinical score, but only captopril reduced the plasma noradrenaline response to submaximal exercise. These findings suggest that angiotensin-enzyme inhibition with captopril will modulate the adrenergic system response to daily activities in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and therefore could have additional salutary effects beyond vasodilatation.\r"

  ".W": "Ventricular arrhythmias in patients after total surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot have been associated with late sudden death. In this large multicenter retrospective study of 359 patients with postoperative tetralogy of Fallot, spontaneous ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and laboratory-induced ventricular tachycardia (VT) by electrophysiologic stimulation were analyzed. The mean age at surgical repair was 5 years and the mean follow-up duration after repair was 7 years. Spontaneous VPCs on ambulatory monitoring were found in 48% and induced VT on electrophysiologic stimulation was found in 17% of patients. Both spontaneous VPCs and induced VT were significantly related to delayed age at repair, longer follow-up interval, symptoms of syncope or presyncope and right ventricular systolic hypertension (greater than 60 mm Hg) (p less than 0.05), but not to right ventricular diastolic pressure greater than 8 mm Hg. The VPCs on ambulatory monitoring were more complex with increasing age at repair and follow-up duration. Induction of VT on electrophysiologic stimulation correlated with spontaneous VPCs including VT on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. The electrophysiologic stimulation protocol varied and the induction of VT increased with a more aggressive stimulation protocol. While induced sustained monomorphic VT was related to all forms of spontaneous VPCs, induced nonsustained polymorphic VT was related to more complex forms of VPCs on ambulatory monitoring. VT was not induced in asymptomatic patients who had normal 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring and normal right ventricular systolic pressure. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The increase in arterial norepinephrine after glucose was also blunted in the obese patients. After a 30-kg weight loss their glucose and lipid profiles were markedly improved but the thermic effect of glucose was still lower than that of the control subjects (4.2%, p less than 0.001). The glucose-induced arterial norepinephrine response remained diminished in the reduced obese patients whereas the changes in plasma epinephrine were similar in all three groups. The results suggest that a defective SNS may be a cause in the development of obesity.\r"

The calculated glycemic indices (GIs) (mean +/- SEM with glucose as the standard) were all low, ranging from 16 +/- 2 for acorns to 40 +/- 5 for corn. Insulin responses and in vitro starch digestibilities correlated with the GI. These results provide further support for the hypothesis that the slow digestion and absorption of starch in traditional foods was a factor that helped protect susceptible populations from developing diabetes.\r"

Hydrogen and methane breath excretion was measured after pasta ingestion; plasma responses were compared with those of an equivalent oral glucose-tolerance test. No significant differences were found between cooking times and plasma indices, orocecal transit time, or incremental hydrogen excretion (delta peak hydrogen). With one exception, pasta meals that were completely absorbed were ingested by methane producers. Postprandial delta peak hydrogen was significantly lower in methane than in nonmethane producers (p less than 0.02). These results point to a lack of influence of cooking time on nutritional characteristics of pasta and suggest that starch malabsorption determined by breath-hydrogen-test criteria may be underestimated in methane producers.\r"

Sections of paraffin-embedded tissues from 584 cases were stained with a monoclonal antibody against desmin (Clone DER 11 from DAKO), using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. The results were tabulated and compared with those from previous reports. The following observations were made: (1) When pronase digestion was performed before staining, desmin was equally demonstrable in tissues fixed in formalin, Zenker's, Bouin's, or B5 fixative; however, desmin staining was lost or significantly diminished in tissues fixed in absolute ethyl alcohol. In contrast, when pronase was not used, a positive staining was demonstrated only in tissue fixed in absolute ethyl alcohol. (2) Positive staining was found in normal muscle (92 of 92 cases), leiomyoma (12 of 13), rhabdomyoma (6 of 6), rhabdomyosarcoma (31 of 31), leiomyosarcoma (18 of 26). (3) Desmin was never found in epithelia, normal mesenchymal tissue other than muscle, tumors stimulating rhabdomyosarcoma, and epithelial tumors. (4) A positive staining was documented in 1 tumor (a fibrous histiocytoma) of 42 benign predominantly spindle cell tumors and in 8 of 89 predominantly spindle cell sarcomas. (5) Desmin was never documented in myoepithelial cells but stained myofibroblasts in 2 of 12 examples of granulation tissue and in 29 of 67 samples containing tumor-associated desmoplasia. The authors' data on the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the evaluated antibody should improve the use of desmin in diagnostic pathology.\r"

  ".W": "Thomsen-Friedenreich (T) antigen, the immediate precursor antigen of the human blood group MN system, has been found in many carcinomas, but it is suppressed in normal tissues and nonmalignant diseases. Using a monoclonal antibody specific for the T epitope and an indirect immunoperoxidase technique at light and electron microscopic levels, the authors studied the expression of T antigen and its potential diagnostic value in ovarian tumors. Among 30 serous and mucinous ovarian cystadenocarcinomas, 20 (67%) were positive and 10 (33%) were negative for T antigen. In carcinomas, positive rates increased in parallel with the tumor grade and were 37%, 75% and 80% for grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors, respectively. Of the nine patients with metastasis, seven (78%) had positive and two had negative reactions in their primary and metastatic tumors. T antigen staining was observed at the intraluminal cell surfaces and peripheral cell membranes. The ultrastructural localization of T antigen revealed electron-dense reaction products at the cell surface and microvillous surfaces. Of the ten benign ovarian tumors, three (30%) were weakly positive and seven (70%) were negative for T antigen. These findings indicate a positive correlation between the presence of immunoreactive T antigen and conventional unfavorable prognostic indicators in ovarian carcinoma. The surface location of T antigen suggests that it may have a functional role at the cell membrane and the membrane may be involved in secretion (shedding) of T antigen. Detection of T antigen may be a useful marker of prognosis in ovarian carcinoma.\r"

The tumor cells in these lymphomas all had very abundant cytoplasm, which often showed a concentration of organelles, especially mitochondria and Golgi apparatus, in regions next to nuclear concavities. One case had very complex cytoplasmic membrane projections resembling a \"microvillous\" lymphoma. These ultrastructural features combined with the frequent reniform nuclei and scattered lysosomes suggested histiocyte differentiation. However the immunophenotype was variable, more often showing \"activation\" markers and abnormal T-cell marker patterns. The mean nuclear area for all cases was between 38.3 +/- 12.7 to 42.3 +/- 16.2 microns2, roughly twice the size of the small lymphocyte population. The nuclear contour index, a measure of irregularity of the nuclear membrane, ranged from 4.75 +/- 0.86 to 6.36 +/- 1.89 (a circle is 3.54). These nuclear parameters are comparable in size to those of previously measured large cell lymphomas but exhibit more nuclear irregularity than most. Ki-1 lymphomas appear to represent a somewhat diverse group of tumors of lymphoid origin that exhibit some hybrid features of histiocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Large cell lymphoma associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)--Richter's syndrome--is a well-recognized entity. Rarely, Hodgkin's or \"Hodgkin's-like\" lymphoma associated with CLL has been reported. The authors present the clinicopathologic findings in eight cases of well-documented CLL in which solid tumors with histologic and immunostaining features of Hodgkin's disease subsequently developed. The histologic patterns observed in these tumors included nodular sclerosing (four cases) and mixed cellularity (four cases). In all eight cases, diagnostic Reed-Sternberg cells stained strongly with antibody to Leu-M1/CD15 but showed no reactivity with antibody to leukocyte common antigen (LCA/CD45). Survival ranged from 2 months to more than 8 years, with a 50% cumulative survival of 12 months; this is in contrast to the 2- to 4-month survival that typifies non-Hodgkin's Richter's syndrome. Therefore, it is important to recognize the Hodgkin's subgroup of lymphomatous CLL transformation.\r"

The IEMA was superior in terms of sensitivity, precision, and linearity. Systematic bias between the two methods resulted in a narrower spread of clinical results, expressed as multiple-of-median, with the IEMA. Consequently, the IEMA produced fewer results that by usual criteria would be considered high (suggesting increased risk of neural tube defect) or low (suggesting increased risk of Down's syndrome). Although both methods may be comparably suitable for neural tube defect screening, the IEMA is advantageous for Down's syndrome risk assessment.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the etiologic role of Chlamydia trachomatis in cystitis, the authors used the immunoperoxidase technique with a monoclonal antibody against Chlamydia and examined paraffin sections from 36 cases of histologically proven cystitis. The average patients' age was 60 (range, 2-85) years. Biopsies were taken for follow-up of treated bladder carcinoma (19), hematuria (8), and other nonneoplastic conditions (9). Chlamydial antigens were detected by immunohistochemistry in 12 (33%) of these 36 cases. Staining for Chlamydia occurred in the upper layers of the transitional epithelium and involved long stretches of epithelium. Underlying inflammation was usually chronic but did not have specific distinguishing features. Eight of the Chlamydia-positive biopsies were taken for follow-up of treated carcinoma, two were for hematuria, one for neurogenic bladder, and one for evaluation of sterile pyuria. Eleven (92%) of these 12 positive cases had a history of recent urologic instrumentation, in contrast to only 11 (46%) of 24 negative cases (P less than 0.02). There was no significant difference in the age or sex distribution between the two groups. The authors conclude that Chlamydia trachomatis can ascend the urethra and infect the bladder urothelium. Urologic instrumentation enhances the ability of Chlamydia to reach the bladder. Chlamydia trachomatis may play an etiologic role in cystitis.\r"

CMV was detected in 26 specimens (12%) by one or more of these methods. With the shell vial assay, 12 (46%) and 15 (58%) specimens were positive after incubation for 16 hours and 40 hours, respectively. CMV was detected in 17 specimens (65%) by the 24-well plate assay. There was no significant difference in the detection of CMV between these assays. CMV was identified by conventional tissue culture in 15 of 22 (68%) evaluable cultures after an average of 14.2 days. More specimens were positive by conventional culture than by the 16-hour shell vial assay (P = 0.035). For optimal detection of CMV in clinical specimens, both conventional tissue cell culture and an early antigen assay should be performed. The two early antigen assays evaluated in this study yielded comparable results. However, the 24-well plates are more easily manipulated, and the 24-well plate assay, as performed, was easier to interpret and more cost efficient.\r"

The immunocytochemical analyses were semiquantitatively scored (histoscore) based on relative staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cell nuclei. The immunocytochemically determined PR status agreed with that obtained by the DCC assay in 76% of the cases when the monoclonal antibody mPRi was used. The agreement was slightly better (82%) with the immunocytochemical assay using the JZB39 antibody. The semiquantitative histoscores correlated significantly with log-transformed cytosol PR concentrations in the DCC assay (mPRi, R = 0.543; JZB39, R = 0.618; P less than 0.0001 for both). The histoscores obtained with the mPRi and JZB39 antibodies were highly correlated with each other in adjacent frozen sections (R = 0.84, P less than 0.0001) the latter antibody giving somewhat higher histoscores. These results further validate the use of immunocytochemical PR assays for routine diagnostic purposes, especially when sufficient material is not available for DCC assays.\r"

All 43 cases of B-cell lymphoma were negative for TCR. Reed Sternberg (RS) cells in 3 of 20 cases of Hodgkin's disease exhibited cell membrane staining for TCR (all nodular sclerosis type), further evidence that some RS cells may be T-cell derived. Twenty-nine of 44 cases of T-cell lymphoma expressed TCR (66%). These included 11 of 12 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) of small and mixed cell type, 8 of 9 cases of lymphoepithelioid cell (Lennert's) lymphoma, and 2 of 4 cases of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Loss of immunoreactivity for TCR occurred in lymphomas of large or activated T-cell type, including 7 of 9 cases of T-cell immunoblastic lymphoma and 3 of 4 cases of large cell PTCL. Antibody beta F1 is a specific and relatively sensitive marker of T-cell phenotype in formalin-fixed paraffin sections of malignant lymphomas.\r"

Group A (n = 40) patients were treated with ranitidine 150 mg twice daily until complete ulcer healing was achieved. Group B (n = 41) received a similar dose of ranitidine until complete relief of pain was achieved, irrespective of ulcer healing. Recurrence of ulcer in group A was treated with a full course of treatment until complete healing of the ulcer was achieved again, whereas, in group B, treatment was given only until pain recurrence was symptomatically controlled. Endoscopic examination was performed each month. Analysis of the results at 8 wk and 28 wk showed that 1) ulcer healing in group A was significantly superior to that in group B up to 24 wk, but at 28 wk the difference was no longer statistically significant (95% vs 70%), 2) the number of painful days were similar in the two groups, 3) group A patients took treatment for a significantly longer period than those in group B, 4) the cost of treatment per patient in group A was significantly greater than that in group B, 5) the recurrence rate assessed in patients followed for 28 wk after complete ulcer healing was similar in the two groups, and 6) the ulcer-related complications were not significantly different in the two groups. These findings indicate that, although on-demand treatment results in slower ulcer healing, it is not associated with an increase in the duration of pain and incidence of complications. A major advantage of this approach was a significant reduction in the cost of treatment. It is concluded that on-demand treatment is an attractive alternative therapeutic approach in the management of duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

Permanent hemostasis was achieved in 45 patients (90%), 31 (62%) cases with one session and 14 (28%) cases with two sessions of sclerosis. Four patients had persistent rebleeding in spite of two sessions of sclerosis, and one patient had a massive rebleeding after the first session; all underwent emergency surgery. We believe that endoscopic sclerosis has a primary role in the treatment of ulcer bleeding, particularly in those patients in whom a visible vessel is identified at endoscopy.\r"

Thirty-two patients with chronic constipation completed a controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over study. Each patient was given two containers, marked A and B, one containing PEG-ELS and the other a placebo. They drank a specified amount (8 or 16 oz) of solution A for five consecutive days. Daily number of bowel movements and stool consistency were recorded. Group I (patients 1-16) drank 8 oz of solution per day; group II (patients 17-32) drank 16 oz of solution per day. Mean stool frequency and mean stool consistency were calculated per 5-day testing period for each treatment group (8 oz placebo, 8 oz PEG-ELS, 16 oz placebo, 16 oz PEG-ELS). Two-factor analysis of variance results confirmed that PEG-ELS was superior to placebo with regard to mean stool frequency (7.75 +/- 4.55 vs. 4.88 +/- 2.62, p less than 0.01) and mean stool consistency (2.56 +/- 1.17 vs. 1.91 +/- 0.94, p less than 0.05). Furthermore, PEG-ELS 16 oz per day was superior to all other groups with regard to the measured variables. Side effects from the PEG-ELS were infrequent and tolerable. Our results indicate that PEG-ELS may be an effective alternative therapy in the treatment of chronic constipation. The proper dosage is probably between 8 and 16 oz per day.\r"

Eighteen cases of AP showed marked and irregularly distributed interlobular fibrosis. The exocrine parenchyma and its immunoreactivity against anti-amylase were rather well preserved, except in the advanced stages of the disease. Protein plugs and pancreatic stones were found. Fifteen cases of COP showed a uniform distribution of inter- and intralobular fibrosis, marked destruction of the exocrine parenchyma, and loss of amylase concentration. Neither protein plugs nor pancreatic stones were found. Anti-collagen immunoreactivity was found in both types of pancreatitis. Although obstruction of the main or small pancreatic ducts is considered to be the principal factor in the genesis of both AP and COP, the histological features of the two diseases are quite distinct from one another. Therefore, duct obstruction caused by protein plugs appears not to be the main factor in the genesis of alcoholic pancreatitis.\r"

Infusion of vasopressin (0.3 U/min) significantly decreased the blood flow in the left gastric vein (-56%), portal trunk (-54%), superior mesenteric vein (-54%), and splenic vein (-56%) as a result of decrease of blood velocity in these vessels. Thus, vasopressin seems to control esophageal variceal bleeding, in part, by reducing blood velocity and blood flow in the left gastric vein following reduction of blood velocity and blood flow in the superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein.\r"

In the English literature, the gastrointestinal manifestations of CSS include eosinophilic gastroenteritis, but the mucosa is not usually ulcerated. On the other hand, Japanese cases are characterized by multiple ulcers which are considered to be caused by ischemia secondary to the vasculitis. Most of the reported cases have not been diagnosed until laparotomy or autopsy, and our case is the first with multiple ulcers throughout the entire colon as a complication of CSS.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the value of serum ferritin, mean cell volume, transferrin saturation, and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin in the diagnosis of iron-deficiency anemia in the elderly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively studied consecutive eligible and consenting anemic patients over the age of 65 years, who underwent blood tests and bone marrow aspiration. The study consisted of 259 inpatients and outpatients at two community hospitals in whom a complete blood count processed by the hospital laboratory demonstrated previously undiagnosed anemia (men: hemoglobin level less than 12 g/dL; women: hemoglobin level less than 11.0 g/dL). RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of our patients had no demonstrable marrow iron and were classified as being iron-deficient. The serum ferritin was the best test for distinguishing those with iron deficiency from those who were not iron-deficient. No other test added clinically important information. The likelihood ratios associated with the serum ferritin level were as follows: greater than 100 micrograms/L, 0.13; greater than 45 micrograms/L but less than or equal to 100 micrograms/L, 0.46; greater than 18 micrograms/L but less than or equal to 45 micrograms/L, 3.12; and less than or equal to 18 micrograms/L, 41.47. These results indicate that values up to 45 micrograms/L increase the likelihood of iron deficiency, whereas values over 45 micrograms/L decrease the likelihood of iron deficiency. Seventy-two percent of those who were not iron-deficient had serum ferritin values greater than 100 micrograms/L, and in populations with a prevalence of iron deficiency of less than 40%, values of greater than 100 micrograms/L reduce the probability of iron deficiency to under 10%. Fifty-five percent of the iron-deficient patients had serum ferritin values of less than 18 micrograms/L, and in populations with a prevalence of iron deficiency of greater than 20%, values of less than 18 micrograms/L increase the probability of iron deficiency to over 95%.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Bucindolol is a potent nonselective beta-blocking agent with vasodilatory properties. In this study, we evaluated the effects of long-term bucindolol therapy in the treatment of heart failure from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were eligible for enrollment if they had symptomatic heart failure, idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40. All patients received an initial test dose of 12.5 mg bucindolol orally every 12 hours for two or three doses. Patients tolerating the test dose were randomly assigned (double-blind) to receive bucindolol or placebo in a 3:2 ratio. Study medication was begun at a dose of 12.5 mg orally every 12 hours and gradually increased over a 1-month period until either a maximum tolerated dose or a target dose of 100 mg every 12 hours was reached. Study medication was then continued for an additional 2 months. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients were enrolled into the study. Twenty-three patients tolerated bucindolol test challenge; 14 were randomized to receive bucindolol, and nine were randomly assigned to receive placebo. The placebo group (age 56 +/- 2 years) was significantly older than the bucindolol group (46 +/- 3 years), but by all other clinical and hemodynamic parameters the two groups were comparable. Twenty-two of 23 patients completed the study. Patients treated with bucindolol had significant improvements in clinical heart failure symptoms and in resting hemodynamic function, including an increase of left ventricular ejection fraction (0.26 +/- 0.02 to 0.35 +/- 0.09, p = 0.003), cardiac index (2.2 +/- 0.1 to 2.5 +/- 0.4 L/minute/m2, p = 0.014), and left ventricular stroke work index (25 +/- 3 to 35 +/- 7 g.m/m2, p = 0.002) and a decrease in pulmonary artery wedge pressure (17 +/- 3 to 10 +/- 5 mm Hg, p = 0.005) and heart rate (86 +/- 3 to 75 +/- 9 beats/minute, p = 0.012). Patients treated with bucindolol also had a significant increase in exercise left ventricular ejection fraction (0.26 +/- 0.03 to 0.32 +/- 0.14, p = 0.015) and reduction in questionnaire-measured symptoms (p = 0.007) and New York Heart Association functional class (p less than 0.001). However, total treadmill exercise duration and maximal oxygen consumption with exercise did not change. No changes in rest or exercise parameters were observed in the placebo-treated group. Central venous plasma norepinephrine concentration decreased significantly in the bucindolol-treated group (423 +/- 79 to 212 +/- 101 pg/mL, p = 0.010), but was unchanged in the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSION: Bucindolol is well tolerated in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure, and therapy for 3 months is associated with improved resting cardiac function, improved heart failure symptoms, and a reduction in venous norepinephrine concentration.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Anti-PL-12 antibody is directed at the enzyme alanyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS). Studies have clearly associated anti-Jo-1, also directed at an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (histidyl-tRNA synthetase), with a subgroup of myositis marked by a high frequency of interstitial lung disease (ILD) and arthritis. A similar syndrome has been reported in patients with antibodies to PL-12, but few patients have been studied. We describe the clinical manifestations in a new series of patients with antibody to PL-12. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sera from patients with polymyositis and sera found to contain anticytoplasmic antibodies were screened for antibody to PL-12 by testing for inhibition of ARS enzymatic activity by serum, and by immunoprecipitation. RESULTS: Nine sera inhibited ARS. These nine plus two additional sera with anticytoplasmic antibodies immunoprecipitated an identical pattern of tRNAs and a polypeptide of 110 kd. Of the 10 patients that could be evaluated, eight had some evidence of myositis, including six that satisfied the criteria for myositis. Three of these six, all with dermatomyositis, had severe muscle involvement. Eight of the 10 patients had radiographic evidence of pulmonary fibrosis, and seven of the eight had clinical pulmonary impairment, including four with clinically severe ILD. Joint manifestations were found in five patients, and arthritis was the only clinical problem in one patient. CONCLUSION: We conclude that anti-PL-12, like anti-Jo-1 and anti-PL-7, was frequently associated with the \"Jo-1 syndrome\" of myositis with ILD. ILD was a major clinical problem in this group of patients.\r"

STUDY IDENTIFICATION: Computerized searches of the MEDLINE database were performed, and the reference list of each retrieved article was reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Review of more than 360 citations and the reference lists of 19 review articles and 61 potentially relevant articles revealed seven double-blind randomized controlled trials that were included in this overview. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and descriptive information concerning the study populations, the specific interventions, and clinically relevant outcome measurements was extracted. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: The common odds ratio for CHF deterioration while receiving digoxin versus placebo was 0.28, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.16 to 0.49. Predictors of digoxin benefit included presence of a third heart sound and the severity and duration of CHF. CONCLUSION: Data from seven trials of high methodologic quality suggest that, on average, one out of nine patients with CHF and sinus rhythm derive a clinically important benefit from digoxin (with a 95% confidence interval of 1/33 to 1/5).\r"

  ".W": "Benzodiazepine derivatives are presumed to exert their pharmacologic activity via interaction with specific molecular recognition sites, termed benzodiazepine receptors, within the brain. The various benzodiazepines used in clinical practice differ considerably in their intrinsic receptor affinity, but the qualitative character of the drug-receptor interaction is similar or identical among this class of drugs. All benzodiazepines are lipophilic (lipid-soluble) substances that relatively rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier and equilibrate with brain tissue. After equilibrium is attained, a constant brain:plasma ratio is maintained, such that plasma concentrations proportionately reflect concentrations of drug in brain. Brain concentrations are proportional to the extent of receptor occupancy, which in turn determines the acute behavioral effect. Clinical differences among benzodiazepines largely reflect differences in pharmacokinetic properties. The onset of action after single oral doses reflects the rate of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, whereas the duration of action is determined by the rate and extent of drug distribution to peripheral tissues, as well as by the rate of elimination and clearance. During multiple dosage, long half-life drugs accumulate, with the concurrent possibility of daytime sedation. However, a benefit of long half-life drugs is that rebound insomnia on abrupt termination is unlikely. Short half-life drugs accumulate minimally and have a lower likelihood of producing daytime sedation. However, they may be more likely to produce rebound insomnia on abrupt discontinuation.\r"

Prescription of these drugs may worsen sleep-related breathing disorders, especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiac failure. The most frequent users of sedative hypnotics are the polymorbid elderly with a secondary complaint of insomnia. Although the benzodiazepines may reduce sleep fragmentation, their long-term use may also cause health problems, such as complete obstructive sleep apnea in heavy snorers or short repetitive central sleep apnea in patients with recent myocardial infarction. Since drugs of this class vary in their effects, it is crucial to note the action of a given benzodiazepine on the control of vital functions during sleep.\r"

Additionally, numerous medical and psychiatric disorders that are highly prevalent in the geriatric population are known to affect sleep adversely. Epidemiologic data indicate that at least 5 million older adults suffer severe disorders of sleep and that most people with severe insomnia receive no treatment for this troubling symptom. However, although the elderly comprise only about 12 percent of the American population, between 35 and 40 percent of all prescriptions for sedative hypnotics are written for people over the age of 60. Moreover, approximately 23 percent of Americans over age 85 reside in long-term care facilities, and institutionalization is an important risk factor for disordered sleep and for sedative hypnotic prescription. Consequently, the evaluation of any sedative hypnotic agent must include substantial assessment of efficacy, safety, and tolerance in geriatric patients.\r"

It is concluded that rebound insomnia is a disturbance of one or two nights' duration that primarily follows discontinuation of short- to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines. It occurs at high doses of a given drug, beyond which no additional hypnotic efficacy is evident. There seem to be clear individual differences in the experience of rebound insomnia, but no prospective studies have established which differences predict rebound. It is likely to be avoided by initiating treatment with the lowest effective dose and tapering the dose upon discontinuation.\r"

In terms of the relations between pharmacologic properties and residual effects, three conclusions can be drawn. First, dose is a major determinant of the presence or absence of morning effects. Every drug studied to date, if given in high enough dose, has produced morning performance decrements. Second, the longer-acting a compound, the more likely it is that a performance decrement will be observed. Finally, some data suggest that behavioral tolerance to the residual effects of hypnotics develops. The observation that benzodiazepines produce amnesia emerged from reports of their clinical use as presurgery medications. Although the initial reports involved intravenous diazepam and were anecdotal in nature, subsequent studies have demonstrated that amnesia is a characteristic of all the benzodiazepines, with the magnitude of the effect being a function of route of administration, dose, and the pharmacokinetics of the particular drug.\r"

Estazolam 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg significantly improves sleep latency, total sleep time, number of nocturnal awakenings, depth of sleep, and sleep quality in adults with chronic insomnia. Long-term studies indicate that estazolam 2.0 mg remains an effective hypnotic for at least six weeks of continuous nightly administration with no evidence of clinically significant tolerance. Estazolam is an effective treatment for situational insomnia and significantly improves sleep in patients with insomnia associated with moderately severe anxiety or depression.\r"

Of the 123 member laboratories that provide screening services, 109 responded. The 109 laboratories screened 586,000 pregnancies annually, and 96 provided interpretations for risk of fetal Down syndrome, accounting for 534,000 pregnancies. Numbers of women screened annually per laboratory ranged from less than 200 to greater than 27,000 (median 3000). A total of 85 of the 96 laboratories used a combination of the maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein cut-off. Ultrasonographic gestational dating was used for the initial interpretation in 25% of the screened pregnancies. The median initial positive rate (the number of women initially classified as being at increased risk) was 3.7% overall, and smaller laboratories were more likely either to have outlying initial positive rates or to be unable to provide such rates. Median initial positive rates were lower for enzyme immunoassay kits than for radioimmunoassay kits (3.0% versus 4.8%). These results indicate that, whereas most laboratories appear to perform satisfactorily in screening for fetal Down syndrome, some laboratories appear to perform satisfactorily in screening for fetal Down syndrome, some laboratories need to refine their methods of assigning risk and others need to develop mechanisms to document initial positive rates and, when appropriate, to analyze the cause of outlying initial positive rates. This survey, combined with information from nonsurveyed laboratories known to screen for fetal Down syndrome, allows an estimation that 1 million pregnancies annually were provided with fetal Down syndrome interpretations in the United States in mid-1988.\r"

Cerebellar abnormalities were present in 95% of fetuses irrespective of gestation; however, the cerebellar abnormality at less than or equal to 24 weeks' gestation was predominantly the banana sign (72%) whereas at gestations greater than 24 weeks it was cerebellar \"absence\" (81%). Both growth retardation and cerebral ventriculomegaly significantly worsened with gestation while the head circumference remained disproportionately small throughout gestation. On the basis of these data, a new approach is proposed for the investigation of patients at high risk for fetal open spina bifida.\r"

Pregnancies in black women not affected by open spina bifida are already known to have higher maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. All of the cases were analyzed with gestational ages assigned by last menstrual period, and all maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values were expressed as multiples of the median, to correct for differences in gestational age and assay among the 15 centers reporting data. The levels from affected pregnancies in white and black women fit log Gaussian distributions, with medians of 3.10 and 4.37 multiples of the median, respectively, on the basis of singleton, unaffected, white pregnancy medians. These results support adjustment of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein values for race in black women; in addition, if a screening program's policy is to screen at a comparable risk in the two races, a higher maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein multiple of the median cutoff would be justified for black women.\r"

Normally these women have recurrent disease for many years before they are referred for evaluation of local vaginal hypersensitivity. We evaluated 18 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis that was unresponsive to all other modalities of therapy and who were skin-test positive to Candida albicans with a positive prick test or intradermal skin test. Three patients had late-phase skin test reactions only. Of the 18 study participants, 16 responded with significant improvement in the mean incidence of episodes of vaginitis per year from 17.2 +/- 2.0 to 4.3 +/- 1.8 (p less than 0.0004). Overall, there was approximately 79% improvement in these patients. More than half the women were also atopic but were not first seen with these allergic symptoms. These data suggest that certain women who have chronic vaginal candidiasis may have a local hypersensitivity response to Candida that may improve with allergy immunotherapy with C. albicans extract. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in a homogeneous group of women with standardized extract is needed to establish this as a recommended form of therapy in this subgroup of patients.\r"

A significant association was observed between uteroplacental systolic to diastolic ratios at 24 weeks' gestation and subsequent fetal hypoxia with a sensitivity of 24.0% and a specificity of 93.9%. However, 70% of abnormal results were not followed by fetal hypoxia. Umbilical artery systolic to diastolic ratios at 24, 28, and 34 weeks' gestation were found to be predictive of intrauterine growth retardation. This predictive capability was enhanced in those growth-retarded fetuses in which hypoxia developed, but was weak when umbilical artery systolic to diastolic ratios were evaluated as primary screening tests for fetal hypoxia. The results confirm a role for Doppler systolic to diastolic ratios in the evaluation of high-risk pregnancies but do not support a role for their use as primary screening tests in low-risk obstetric populations.\r"

Six patients without an ectopic pregnancy underwent unnecessary laparotomy because of positive culdocentesis test results, whereas 27 patients who were discharged from the emergency room after negative test results were obtained subsequently were found to have ectopic pregnancies.

Moreover, women who smoke may have a reduced risk of uterine fibroids, endometriosis, hyperemesis gravidarum, and benign breast disease. Several possible mechanisms for these effects have been identified. Smoking does not appear to be clearly related to estradiol levels, at least in postmenopausal women, although levels of adrenal androgens are increased. Moreover, smoking appears to alter the metabolism of estradiol, leading to enhanced formation of the inactive catechol estrogens.\r"

We computed waveform indices from directly measured umbilical artery blood flow in chronically instrumented ovine fetuses from 109 to 138 days of gestation (term, 145 days). The three waveform indices (systolic/diastolic ratio, pulsatility index, and resistance index) correlated significantly with each other (r = 0.90 to 0.98). These indices progressively decreased with gestation and were significantly correlated with calculated umbilical vascular resistance (r = 0.68 to 0.70, p less than 0.01) and with umbilical blood flow (r = -0.71, p less than 0.01). During the final week of pregnancy, systolic/diastolic ratio could be predicted by the combination of placental size (total cotyledonary mass), fetal size (ponderal index), and either umbilical blood flow or umbilical vascular resistance (multiple linear regression, r2 = 0.94). Fetal heart rate declined from day 109 of gestation to 138 days. Fetal heart rate was significantly correlated with waveform indices only when values exceeded 170 beats/min (r = -0.37 to -0.51). Ovine fetal umbilical artery waveform indices changed at approximately the same rate as those reported for human fetuses in late gestation on the basis of external Doppler ultrasonographic velocity measurements. These results suggest that the sheep is a suitable model for investigations of umbilical artery waveform analysis.\r"

The adverse effects seen with nafarelin, mainly hot flashes, were related to its mode of action, namely hypoestrogenemia induced by reversible inhibition of ovarian hormone production. Hypoestrogenemia was associated with a decrease of bone density in the lumbar vertebrae, but these changes were partially or completely reversible after treatment was discontinued. No significant changes in bone mass occurred in the distal radius. Danazol was associated with androgenic and metabolic adverse effects, including weight gain, negative effects on the lipid profile, and elevated liver enzyme levels. Nafarelin was found to be as effective as danazol for the management of endometriosis, with a different and more favorable safety profile.\r"

One group received nafarelin, 200 micrograms twice daily, and placebo capsules identical to danazol, twice daily. The other group received danazol capsules, 200 mg twice daily, and a placebo nasal spray identical to nafarelin, twice daily. A comparison of decreases in both groups of American Fertility Society endometriosis scores and in severity scores developed by the investigators indicates that nafarelin and danazol are equally effective in the treatment of endometriosis.\r"

Recent research has identified certain immunogenetic factors which may play a role in the progression of alcoholic cirrhosis as well as autoimmune forms of cirrhosis. In this study we examined the role of familial alcoholism and HLA status in determining age of liver disease onset. Patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic autoimmune cirrhosis and having a history of familial alcoholism experience an earlier age of onset of liver disease than patients without a family history of alcoholism. The same result was true for patients with alcoholic liver disease. This effect may be more prominent in females. Subjects with HLA B-8 also had a younger age of onset of nonalcoholic autoimmune liver disease. The presence of a family history of alcoholism in conjunction with the presence of HLA B-8 and DR-3 also was related to an earlier age of disease onset. These findings suggest that the susceptibility to develop alcoholism and nonalcoholic autoimmune liver disease may be transmitted conjointly and point to potential fruitful areas of research for identifying individuals at risk for developing cirrhosis as well as detecting genetic markers for alcoholism.\r"

  ".W": "Anterior pituitary corticotrope function was analyzed in the long sleep (LS) and short sleep (SS) lines of mice selectively bred for differences in sensitivity to ethanol. In vivo challenge with acute ethanol or CRH administration or the stress of novel handling resulted in a more pronounced increase in serum corticosterone levels in LS mice compared with SS mice. Likewise, in vivo administration of ethanol resulted in 3-fold higher levels of anterior pituitary pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA in LS mice compared with SS mice. However, this differential regulation of the HPA axis during in vivo analysis was not observed during in vitro studies of anterior pituitary corticotrope function. Primary cultures of LS and SS anterior pituicytes responded appropriately but equivalently to a variety of secretagogues known to stimulate anterior pituitary ACTH secretion. These secretagogues included CRH (10 nM), dibutyryl-cAMP (1 mM), vasopressin (100 nM), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nM). Ethanol had no direct stimulatory effect on pituitary ACTH secretion. Quantitation of anterior pituitary corticotrope peptide biosynthesis was determined by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled anterior pituitary explants and from [35S]methionine-labeled primary cultures of anterior pituitary cells. LS mice pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis in pituitary explants was 2-fold greater than pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis in SS mice pituitary explants. However, in culture, isolated from hypothalamic and adrenal factors, the LS anterior pituitary pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthetic rate became equivalent to the SS anterior pituitary pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthetic rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90178573\r", 
  ".W": "A rat model of third trimester fetal alcohol exposure was used to determine whether a smaller daily dose of alcohol can induce more severe microencephaly and neuronal loss than a larger dose, if the small dose is consumed in such a way that it produces higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). The possibility of regional differences within the developing brain to alcohol-induced neuronal loss was also investigated. Sprague-Dawley rat pups were reared artificially over postnatal Days 4-10 (a period of rapid brain growth similar to that of the human third trimester). Two groups received a daily alcohol dose of 4.5 g/kg, administered either as a 5.1% solution in four of the 12 daily feedings or as a 10.2% solution in two of the 12 feedings. A third group received a higher daily dose (6.6 g/kg) administered as a 2.5% solution in every feeding. Gastrostomy and suckle controls were also reared. On postnatal Day 10, the animals were perfused, and brain weights were obtained. In the hippocampal formation, cell counts were made of the pyramidal cells of fields CA1 and CA2/3, the multiple cell types of CA4 and the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. In the cerebellum, Purkinje cells and granule cells were counted in each of the ten lobules of the vermis. The lower daily dose (4.5 g/kg) condensed into two or four feedings produced high maximum BACs (means of 361.6 and 190.7 mg/dl, respectively) and significant microencephaly and cell loss, relative to controls. The higher daily dose (6.6 g/kg), administered continuously, resulted in low BACs (mean of 39.2 mg/dl) and induced no microencephaly or cell loss. Regional differences in neuronal vulnerability to alcohol were evident. In the hippocampus, CA1 neuronal number was significantly reduced only by the most condensed alcohol treatment, while CA3, CA4, and the dentate gyrus populations were not reduced with any alcohol treatment. In the cerebellum, some lobules suffered significantly greater Purkinje cell loss and granule cell loss than did others. The regions in which Purkinje cells were most mature at the time of the alcohol exposure were the most vulnerable to Purkinje cell loss.\r"

Similarly, frequent consumption of six or more drinks per occasion significantly increased the risk of problems for both men and women. Among males elevated average daily consumption contributed more to alcohol-related problems than frequency of intoxication, while the opposite was true for females. These results indicate that the frequency and amount of alcohol consumption are important risk factors for both nonalcoholics and alcoholics, and that measures of drinking pattern may be useful for screening purposes.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined metabolic interactions between two nutrients--ethanol and carbohydrate. Both nutrients are metabolized by a common pathway to fatty acids from acetyl-coenzyme A by lipogenic enzymes. The effects of ethanol and carbohydrate on the induction of lipogenic enzymes in livers of rats were examined using two types of base diets differing in carbohydrate and lipid content and using isocaloric substitutions of ethanol, carbohydrate, and fat. Three nonlipogenic enzymes were used for comparison. Isocaloric substitution of both fat and carbohydrate for ethanol was necessary to show the specific effects of alcohol on the activity of lipogenic or nonlipogenic enzymes. Carbohydrate, and not ethanol, induced lipogenic enzymes. Ethanol specifically reduced the activity of lactate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme, but did not affect those of alcohol dehydrogenase or glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Ethanol interacted with carbohydrate to increase the activity of ATP citrate lyase. In addition, we studied the effects of ethanol and different kinds of carbohydrates on the growth of rats and on the morphology of their livers and intestines. Ethanol significantly decreased growth characteristics (weight gain, growth rate, and caloric efficiency). Fructose, either as a monosaccharide or in sucrose, decreased this alcohol effect. Sucrose was better than glucose in lowering lipid accumulation in livers of rats. Fragility of intestinal villi was found with an alcohol, low carbohydrate diet, but was not present in alcohol diets with a higher level of carbohydrate. In contrast to carbohydrate, ethanol lacked some characteristics of a nutrient, namely, it did not induce some enzymes involved in its metabolism and did not promote optimum growth.\r"

These animals had a shortened stride length and an increased angle of placement of the hindfeet relative to artificially reared and suckle-control animals. The altered gait pattern may be the result of alcohol-induced hippocampal and cerebellar damage during the brain growth spurt.\r"

The theorized toxic metabolite of cocaine is thought to be generated by a multistep pathway mediated primarily by cytochrome P-450. Ethanol, whether administered acutely or chronically, is known to have diverse effects on numerous hepatocellular biochemical pathways. The present study was designed to characterize not only the effects of acute and chronic ethanol on cocaine-mediated hepatotoxicity but also on the hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) in an attempt to correlate depletions of GSH with changes in toxicity. Male and female mice were administered an acute 50 mg/kg dose of cocaine either 1 hr after an acute 3 g/kg dose of ethanol, or after 5 days of consuming an ethanol-containing liquid diet. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity was measured in blood collected 24 hr after the acute cocaine dose. In addition, hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH) and cytochrome P-450 content were measured at the point in the pretreatment where cocaine was administered. The results of this study indicate that both acute and chronic ethanol pretreatment can markedly enhance the hepatotoxicity of cocaine in both male and female mice and that the enhancement is significantly greater after chronic ethanol pretreatment. Hepatic GSH was slightly decreased 1 hr after an acute dose of ethanol and significantly decreased after chronic ethanol consumption.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Incubation of these cells in the presence of ethanol significantly decreased cell growth. This inhibition was accompanied by a strong increase in cellular protein. Stimulation of specific disaccharidases, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and aminopeptidase activities by ethanol was dose- and time-dependent. Ethanol induces a change in the relative proportions of the different lipid classes synthesized; triglycerides, fatty acids, and cholesterol esters were preferentially synthethysed. Our findings show that cell lines are good models for investigation of the effects of ethanol, and that alcohol considerably modifies the functions of intestinal epithelial cells.\r"

Forty-seven males, 48.4 +/- 1.7 years of age (mean +/- SEM), reporting 24.8 +/- 1.5 years of heavy alcohol use, comprised the abstaining alcohol group. Thirty-five age- and weight-matched males, 50.3 +/- 1.7 years were the control group. The alcohol group had significantly more nighttime oxygen desaturations below 90% than did the control group (16.9 +/- 3.3 vs. 6.2 +/- 1.4, F = 7.8, p less than 0.01), with significantly higher percentages of individuals in the alcohol group manifesting more than 10 or 20 oxygen desaturations below 90%. Regression analyses within the alcohol group revealed that severity of alcohol abuse, but not age, body mass index, days abstinent, or smoking significantly predicted levels of nighttime hypoxemia. These results confirm our original observation of increased nighttime hypoxemia in abstaining chronic alcoholic men and suggest that long-term alcohol abuse may be a risk factor for development of sleep apnea.\r"

  ".W": "Studies were designed to examine the previously proposed hypothesis that some of the pharmacological actions of ethanol are mediated by neurotensinergic processes. Neurotensin-immunoreactivity (NT-ir) was extracted from various brain regions and shown by high performance liquid chromatography to possess the same retention time as authentic bovine NT1-13. The highest levels of NT-ir were observed in the hypothalamus with intermediate levels in the midbrain and striatum and lowest levels in the frontal cortex. Levels of NT-ir were higher in hypothalamus and midbrain from long-sleep (LS) than from short-sleep (SS) mice. Ethanol, in vivo, produced a dose-dependent decrease in NT-ir in several brain regions; low doses, 1.5 to 3.0 g/kg, but not high doses, 4.1 g/kg, of ethanol significantly decreased NT-ir in hypothalamus, midbrain, and striatum of LS and SS mice. Levels of NT-ir in the frontal cortex were not altered by ethanol administration. Ethanol-induced decreases in NT-ir were of rapid onset with a maximum decrease in 5 min after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, and they were of long duration with levels remaining depressed for 4 hr. These findings show that subhypnotic, intoxicating doses of ethanol enhance NT release, in vivo, and support the hypothesis that some of ethanol's actions are mediated by neurotensinergic systems.\r"

  ".W": "Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH; EC 1.2.1.3) activity was determined in leukocytes and erythrocytes from alcoholic patients during different stages of disulfiram (Antabuse) treatment. Assays were performed by incubating intact isolated blood cells in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C), using 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), the biogenic aldehyde derived from dopamine, as substrate. The ALDH activity was assessed from the amount of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) formed, as analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The leukocyte ALDH, which is similar to the liver \"mitochondrial\" low-Km ALDH isozyme, was maximally inhibited (about 40-60%) within 2 to 3 days after the initial disulfiram administration (dosage 200 or 400 mg/day orally). The time to reach maximum inhibition (about 95%) of the erythrocyte ALDH, which closely resembles the liver \"cytosolic\" high-Km isozyme, varied from 3 to more than 6 days. When medication was completed, the leukocyte ALDH activity remained unaltered for the first 2 days, and did not revert to normal levels until about 6 to 7 days after terminating treatment. The erythrocyte ALDH was still inhibited by about 90% 1 week after the last disulfiram administration. These results suggest that the leukocyte ALDH activity might provide an easily accessible marker for monitoring effect and time course of ALDH inhibition during disulfiram treatment.\r"

Leukocytes isolated from subjects undergoing alcohol detoxification showed increases in basal levels of leukocyte cyclic AMP, in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP, and in ethanol-stimulated cyclic AMP on the 2nd or 3rd day of withdrawal in comparison to the first day of withdrawal and in comparison to abstinent subjects.

All of the children of alcoholics were from high density families (each father had an average of 3.7 first and second-degree relatives meeting criteria for alcoholism). Subjects were presented with high- and low-pitched tones with global probabilities of 25% and 75% of total trials, respectively. Subjects were instructed to count silently the number of \"high\" tones (rare targets) but not the number of \"low\" tones (non-targets) and report the number heard. In a second auditory paradigm (Choice Reaction task), subjects were asked to perform a different motor response to each high or low tone. The amplitude of the P300 component was influenced significantly by event probability (decreased amplitudes were associated with increased event probability). A greater rate of decrease in P300 amplitude occurred among the high risk children as event probability increased. In addition, greater negativity beginning at approximately N250 was observed for both tasks at the frontal electrode for the high risk children as compared to controls. This enhanced frontal negativity is interpreted in terms of a maturational lag hypothesis.\r"

Subjects with a positive family history of alcoholism (FHP) did not differ from subjects without alcoholic relatives (FHN) either in frequency of choice of ETH over PLC (about 60% of occasions) or in the total dose self-administered (about 0.9 g/kg per session). The two groups also did not differ on most measures of acute ETH effects (e.g., mood-altering effects, liking ratings, behavioral changes, or blood ETH levels). The FHP subjects reported a slightly faster onset of \"feeling any drug effects\" and \"high\" after ETH than the FHN group. The FHP group also scored higher than the FHN group on several scales indicative of dysphoric mood, regardless of drug administration. Thus, under these conditions male social drinkers with or without a family history of alcoholism did not differ either in preference for ETH or in their subjective responses to the drug.\r"

After excluding those who received no drug therapy, patients who received benzodiazepine after the training received significantly higher amounts of benzodiazepine (M = 252.50 mg) than those who received drug before (M = 144.64 mg). The average number of hours from the first benzodiazepine dose to the last was reduced from 13 to 5 hr.

However, an animal model is lacking for evaluating the underlying mechanisms. To develop such a model of ethanol-induced esophageal motor dysfunction, esophageal manometry was done in control, chronically intoxicated, and withdrawing cats. Ethanol was administered for at least 30 days via gastrostomy tube and blood alcohol levels, typically 300 mg/dl, were adjusted to maintain inebriation. LESP and upper (striated muscle) and lower (smooth muscle) ECA were elevated in male withdrawing cats. In intoxicated cats only upper ECA was elevated. Surprisingly, LESP and ECA were not significantly affected in females. Duration of ECA was prolonged in both male and female intoxicated cats. These findings indicate that: (1) similar to withdrawing men, ECA and LESP are elevated in withdrawing male cats; (2) ethanol-treated cats are an appropriate model for studying the mechanism of ethanol effects on esophageal motor function; (3) gender has a significant role in influencing the effects of alcohol.\r"

The pharmacokinetics of ethanol was subsequently studied in mice of these strains given an intraperitoneal dose of 116 mmoles/l of total body water based on the desiccation study. This dose was equivalent to 70, 76, and 80 mmoles/kg in the DBA/2J, CBA/J, and C57BL/6J strains, respectively. The zero time concentrations were nearly identical between strains; therefore volume of distribution (VD) estimates based on mmole/kg doses reflected interstrain differences in total body water. The apparent zero order elimination rate was significantly greater in the DBA/2J strain versus the other two strains using this regimen. Interstrain differences in ethanol sleep time paralleled the differences in anesthetic sensitivity evidenced by blood concentrations at the time of regaining the righting reflex. The results demonstrate the importance of considering differences in total body water and hence ethanol VD when comparing the effects of ethanol in inbred mouse strains.\r"

Female rats were pair-fed either ethanol-containing or isocaloric control liquid diets for 68 days, during which time they underwent one pregnancy cycle. For some studies, animals were fed ethanol diets for 68 days beginning prior to pregnancy and continuing through lactation and involution. They were infected on Day 7 of involution with 1000 L1 larvae of T. spiralis and tested for a primary rejection response 10 days later. To test for a secondary immune response, rats were infected with T. spiralis, placed on ethanol-containing liquid diet 15 days later, and after 68 days on diets, challenged with 1000 T. spiralis larvae and killed 3 days later. For primary immunized studies, ethanol-treated animals demonstrated significantly lower levels of anti-T. spiralis serum antibodies in ELISA, reduced rates of H3 thymidine incorporation by lymph node cells stimulated with T. spiralis antigen and significantly higher numbers of intestinal worm burdens (decreased immunity) compared with pair-fed controls. For animals sensitized to T. spiralis prior to pregnancy and given a secondary challenge during involution, no differences were found between ethanol and pair-fed animals in their ability to reject their worm burdens or in anti-T. spiralis serum antibody levels; however, ethanol-treated animals showed reduced rates of thymidine incorporation by lymph node cells when stimulated with T. spiralis antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A previous study demonstrating the ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to attenuate voluntary alcohol intake in rats prompted the suggestion that these drugs, currently marketed for the treatment of hypertension, may also be useful in dealing with human alcohol abuse. The present experiments explored in more detail the effect and possible mechanisms of action of this class of drug on alcohol consumption in rats. Experiment one demonstrated that Abutapril, a new ACE inhibitor, significantly reduced alcohol intake and that this effect could not be blocked by either an ANG II or an opiate receptor antagonist suggesting that neither the peripheral renin-angiotensin system (RAS) nor the endogenous enkephalins are involved in the ability of ACE inhibition to attenuate alcohol intake. Experiments two and three showed that ACE inhibition effectively reduced alcohol drinking faster in animals with elevated RAS activity and not at all in animals with suppressed RAS activity indicating that initial levels of RAS activity may determine the speed and ability of ACE inhibition to attenuate alcohol intake. ACE inhibitors may reduce alcohol intake by elevating a nonapeptide fragment or by elevating central ANG II levels. The assessment of this class of drugs to reduce alcohol intake in humans should include a monitoring of the initial level of activity in the renin-angiotensin system since this may be a predictor of the effectiveness of treatment with the ACE inhibitors.\r"

Clonidine (2 micrograms/kg) was administered epidurally in group 1 and intramuscularly in group 2. Analgesia was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) over a period of 6 h following clonidine administration. Venous blood samples were obtained at specific intervals for radioimmunoassay determination of plasma clonidine concentrations. The maximum reduction in VAS pain score was 78.5 +/- 20.6% in the EP group and 68.1 +/- 31.5% in the IM group (NS). Onset of analgesia was similar (within 15 min of injection), but duration tended to be longer after epidural than intramuscular administration (208 +/- 87 min vs. 168 +/- 95 min, mean +/- SD, P greater than 0.05). The peak plasma clonidine concentration after EP injection was 0.82 +/- 0.22 ng/ml and 1.02 +/- 0.76 ng/ml after IM injection. Hypotension, bradycardia, and drowsiness occurred with both methods of administration. None of these effects required treatment. Thus, in postoperative patients clonidine produces similar analgesia and side effects after parenteral or EP administration.\r"

It is estimated that nearly five to ten million people are infected worldwide with the etiologic agent of AIDS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). With a mean incubation period from time of infection to the development of AIDS of eight to ten years, it is projected that nearly all HIV-1-infected individuals will develop AIDS within the next 15 years. In the United States alone, 104,210 cases of AIDS and more than 61,000 deaths have been reported. Sexual, parenteral, and perinatal transmission routes have remained the major modes of transmission, although the proportion of cases within each risk behavior category has changed. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in the proportion of patients with AIDS who have acknowledged either IV drug use or heterosexual contact with other individuals at high risk for HIV infection. Inner-city minority populations are disproportionately represented among AIDS patients, and HIV-seroprevalence studies demonstrate significantly higher rates of infection among blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, even within the same risk category. In 1988, the US Public Health Service estimated that approximately 1.0 to 1.5 million Americans were currently infected with HIV-1 and that by the end of 1992, a cumulative total of 380,000 cases of AIDS will be diagnosed. In 1992, 80,000 cases of AIDS may be diagnosed, with 66,000 deaths occurring during that year alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Like all retroviruses, the viral genes are carried in the viral particle in the form of single-stranded RNA. Once inside a susceptible host cell, this RNA template is reverse-transcribed by virally supplied enzyme functions into a DNA copy, which becomes integrated permanently into the host's own genetic material. The genome of HIV-1, comprising approximately 10,000 bases, is much more complex than those of classic retroviruses, encoding a minimum of six gene products in addition to the gag, pol, and env genes characteristic of all retroviruses. These genes encode regulatory functions that act at diverse points in the virus life cycle. Together, they provide HIV-1 with an exceptional ability to modulate its replication depending on its host environment. This characteristic is reflected in the different stages presented by the disease and the diverse behaviors of the virus in different types of host cells. A greater understanding of the mechanics of this regulation and the factors that influence it may someday permit therapeutic intervention in the disease process that will halt virus replication and the progression of pathology in infected individuals.\r"

In inner-city emergency departments, significant numbers of patients have unrecognized human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Transmission of HIV in the health care setting has been predominantly from exposure to patients' infected blood, but most of the exposures (80%) are due to injuries from sharp instruments. There are only 18 documented cases of occupational HIV transmission worldwide. Four of these have occurred from nonparenteral exposures. Based on surveillance studies, the best estimate of seroconversion after exposure is about 0.5%. However, due to methodologic limitations, these figures may be underestimations. The effectiveness of azidothymidine for postexposure prophylaxis has not been shown. Currently, the best protection against HIV and other blood-borne pathogens remains use of universal precautions.\r"

All patients presenting to the emergency department during a two-year period who fell on their outstretched hand and had pain and/or swelling in the anatomic snuffbox were evaluated initially and at two weeks. All patients received at least the standard four-view wrist radiography. If a fracture was not detected, two additional views were obtained. Ninety patients were enrolled; 54 fractures of the navicular were evident on initial four-view radiography. Thirty-six patients with a negative initial four-view radiograph had two additional views; 11 of the 36 were found to have a fracture. The other 25 patients failed to show fracture. In this series; no fractures were missed when six-view radiography was used. Anatomic snuffbox tenderness was 100% sensitive and 76% specific and had a 92% positive predictive value for carpal navicular fracture. We conclude that patients clinically suspected of carpal navicular fracture should undergo additional radiologic views if the standard four views of the wrist are negative.\r"

Once considered an experimental tool restricted exclusively to sophisticated specialty neurosurgical and neuroanesthesia intensive care units, this straightforward and rapidly evolving technology is readily available and relatively easy to apply as a bedside intensive care procedure for selected patients. Many indications of particular interest to emergency physicians are indicated. The precise role of ICP monitoring in the prehospital management of patients has not been established. At this time, the conventional treatments for presumed ICP elevations, as outlined, are the mainstays of prehospital care. ICP monitoring may have a role in more extended or lengthy interinstitutional transfers of some critically ill patients.\r"

Molecular genetic approaches have been used to study structure-function relationships of several steroid receptor proteins, the most extensive analysis has been that of the glucocorticoid receptor. Several breakthroughs in the study of steroid hormone action include the construction of novel chimeric steroid receptor proteins, functional expression of steroid receptors in yeast, and the development of sensitive cloning techniques designed to isolate low abundance, hormonally regulated transcripts.\r"

A defect in beta-receptor function is not the cause of asthma but treatment with beta 2-stimulants induces a down-regulation of beta-receptors and beta-receptor function outside the lung. There is, however, no convincing evidence that tachyphylaxis of clinical importance to the bronchodilating effect occurs in asthmatics receiving normal doses of beta 2-receptor stimulants. A slight rebound increase of bronchial hyperreactivity has, however, been demonstrated 12 to 23 h after stopping regular treatment. This may be due to slight tachyphylaxis not visible in normal lung function tests. Inhaled steroids should be given to all asthmatics needing regular inhaled beta 2-agonist treatment, at least to adults. Steroids not only seem to reduce bronchial inflammation and hyperreactivity, and thereby the distribution of inhaled drugs, but also attend to reverse beta 2-receptor subsensitivity.\r"

Introduction of beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP), the first corticosteroid that is clinically useful when delivered by aerosol, provided a major advance in asthma therapy. Patients who were previously maintained on daily systemic steroids could be transferred to inhaled steroids with no loss of medical benefit and significant improvement in the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The value of BDP and subsequent topical corticosteroids lies in their pharmacologic properties. These agents possess increased intrinsic potency when administered by inhaler. At the same time they have considerably lower systemic potency than corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone and dexamethasone in aerosol form. This is because the fraction of the topically useful compounds that is swallowed, which is substantial, is rapidly inactivated by first-pass metabolism in the liver. Absorption of unmetabolized drug through the pulmonary circulation accounts for most of the systemic effect of topical corticosteroids. Use of spacers in the aerosol delivery device can further increase the efficacy of these substances, or allow lowering of the dose.\r"

Corticosteroids reduce BHR and asthma symptoms and, although their precise mode of action is not yet certain, it is likely that they suppress the allergic inflammatory response. They may act on macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and airway microvascular leak to inhibit the late response and BHR that follows allergen exposure, whereas chronic administration may also reduce the number of mast cells in airways to decrease the immediate response to allergen and exercise. In view of the safety of administration, inhaled corticosteroids should be considered as first line therapy for chronic asthma, with the aim of suppressing inflammation and reducing the need for bronchodilator therapy.\r"

Reflex cough or bronchospasm triggered by the inhaled drug occur fairly commonly, but are easily corrected by appropriate treatment. The systemic complications of IS therapy are inconsequential in most patients treated with conventional low doses. Higher doses are more effective but also more active systemically. Despite this, the ratio of systemic-to-antiasthmatic activities may be more favorable with high dose IS than with oral prednisone when the two treatments are compared at equivalent levels of asthma response. The potential risk of adverse systemic effects accruing from the long-term use of intermediate or high doses of IS needs to be rigorously studied.\r"

The study subjects were defined as having EIA if they exhibited a greater than 15% decrease in FEV1 after completing 6 min of treadmill exercise. There were no significant differences between mean preexercise and mean postexercise mast cell-derived BAL histamine (186 +/- 67 versus 148 +/- 36 pg/ml), tryptase (4.5 +/- 2.0 versus 2.8 +/- 2.0 ng/ml), prostaglandin D2 (26 +/- 11 versus 32 +/- 25 pg/ml), or leukotriene C4 (less than 100 versus less than 100 pg/ml). In addition, mast cells present in BAL fluid after exercise contained similar amounts of cellular histamine compared with BAL mast cells obtained before exercise (preexercise BAL cellular histamine, 26.6 +/- 12.3 ng/10(6) BAL cells; postexercise BAL cellular histamine, 22.7 +/- 9.1 ng/10(6) BAL cells), indicating that depletion of preformed mast cell mediators are unlikely to account for the refractory period in EIA. This study suggests that the cellular pathogenesis of EIA (mast cell-independent) differs from current theories of the pathogenesis of extrinsic allergen-induced asthma (mast cell-dependent).\r"

Patients were allowed albuterol aerosol, short-acting theophylline, and pseudoephedrine only as needed. The study was completed by 221 asthmatic subjects. No significant differences in symptoms, medication, or pulmonary function existed between groups at baseline. Analysis of the zero hour FEV1 before azelastine administration on eight occasions during the 12 wk of therapy indicated an increasing slope for azelastine 6 mg that was statistically different from that of placebo; similarly, the slope for azelastine 4 mg showed the same trend, but it did not reach statistical significance. All azelastine groups had significant reductions of as-needed medication after 1 wk; only in the 4-mg and 6-mg groups was this reduction sustained for 12 wk. Asthma symptom scores and peak expiratory flow measurements remained stable in the azelastine groups despite significant reductions in concomitant medication administration. Side effects were minor and included: altered taste (30.1 to 51.9%), drowsiness (6.0 to 16.9%), and dry mouth (3.8 to 6.1%).

Each subject received terbutaline, 0.25 mg subcutaneously, followed 30 min later either by a second subcutaneous dose of terbutaline (sequential) or normal saline (single) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion. Maximum reductions in plasma potassium from baseline were significantly greater (p less than 0.05) following sequential treatment compared to single treatment (-1.1 versus -0.6 mEq/L, respectively). Improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 s were temporally related to changes in serum potassium and were significantly greater (p less than 0.01) following sequential terbutaline treatment. Prolongation of the QTc interval occurred following both treatment regimens. The change in QTc was statistically significant only following sequential treatment, increasing from 377 +/- 21 to 441 +/- 39 ms (p less than 0.05). Sequential doses of parenterally administered terbutaline result in clinically significant reductions in plasma potassium that are temporally related to changes in pulmonary function and associated with important electrocardiographic alterations.\r"

To address shortcomings in previous experimental design, we performed double-blind randomized nasal challenges in asthmatic patients with allergic rhinitis and in controls. Using pledgets containing 10-microliters aliquots of 0.9% saline or increasing concentrations of methacholine or histamine, we were able to increase nasal resistance significantly in both groups. Only methacholine caused an increase in lower airway resistance, and this could be blunted by premedication of the nasal mucosa with phenylephrine. This suggests that the effect on lower airway resistance was due to systemic absorption. Our study does not support the existence of a nasobronchial reflex from mechanical alteration of the nasal mucosa.\r"

However, resistance to airflow in small airways in the periphery of the lung accounts for only a small fraction of total airway resistance. Consequently, abnormalities of small airway function may not be readily detected using routine pulmonary function testing. In the present study, resistance of the peripheral lung was examined directly in six normal subjects and nine mildly asthmatic subjects. There were no significant differences between the normal and asthmatic groups in pulmonary function assessed by spirometry (FEV1, FVC) and body plethysmography (specific airway conductance). Direct measurements of peripheral lung function were made using a fiberoptic bronchoscope wedged into a subsegmental, right upper lobe bronchus. Using a double-lumen catheter inserted into the instrument channel of the bronchoscope, pressures (PB) produced by three or more different levels of gas flow (V) (5% CO2 in air) between 50 and 500 ml/min were measured. All pressure measurements were made at a constant lung volume (i.e., functional residual capacity) confirmed by monitoring transpulmonary pressure with an esophageal balloon. The pressure-flow relationship in both normal and asthmatic subjects could be approximated by a straight line through the origin, demonstrating these airways to be relatively nondistensible. Peripheral lung resistance (Rp) was defined by PB/V and averaged for three or more levels of flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purpose of the present study was to examine the relationship of methacholine airway responsiveness and markers of atopy to rate of decline in lung function among 790 men, age 40 to 79 yr, followed in the Normative Aging Study. Airway responsiveness was assessed at the end of follow-up, which ranged from 14 to 24 yr. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that greater methacholine airway responsiveness was associated with more rapid annual FEV1 decline. Stratified analysis suggested that this association was stronger among skin test-negative, current smokers. No significant relationship was found between serum IgE level and annual FEV1 decline. A weak but statistically significant correlation between eosinophil count and mean annual FEV1 decline was noted among skin test-negative individuals (r = -0.08; p = 0.03). Results from the present study do not show a clear association between atopy and decline in FEV1. These data, however, do indicate an independent association between heightened methacholine responsiveness on decline in FEV1 in adult males.\r"

Pneumonia and influenza constitute the sixth leading cause of death among Indians and the fifth leading cause of death among the U.S. All Races population. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the fourth leading cause of death among U.S. All Races, but only the tenth leading cause of death among Indians. Pneumonia and tuberculosis are more significant causes of death and disability for Indians than are COPD and cancer of the lung. The explanation for these differences in mortality rates between Indians and the general population are not known. Respiratory system diseases are responsible for 10.6% of Indian hospitalizations. The most frequent is pneumonia, which accounts for approximately 4% of all Indian hospitalizations. Differences in respiratory diseases between Indian groups are sometimes striking, with a sharp increase in mortality and hospitalization in the Areas across the northern border of the lower 48 states. There is also a much higher prevalence of cigarette smoking in those same Areas.\r"

We developed a method for the sequential assessment of pulmonary macromolecule accumulation and small solute clearance in vivo using a gamma camera. We measured the exponential clearance coefficient of 111In-labeled diethylene triamine penta-acetate (111In-DTPA) to assess airway clearance of small solutes. We also calculated the exponential equilibration coefficient of 111In-labeled transferrin (111In-TF) to assess intrapulmonary accumulation of transferrin. We determined these parameters in guinea pigs with Escherichia coli peritonitis and compared them with a saline-treated control group, oleic-acid-treated groups, and a group treated with low molecular weight dextran Ringer solution. The pulmonary DTPA clearance and the intrapulmonary transferrin accumulation were significantly increased in the peritonitis group (29.4 +/- 8.2 x 10(-3) min-1, p less than 0.02, and 15.1 +/- 3.1 x 10(-3) min-1, p less than 0.02) when compared with the control group (3.1 +/- 0.8 x 10(-3) min-1 and 4.5 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3) min-1). These changes developed within 5.5 h of the initial insult. Neither increased extravascular lung water nor elevated pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures were detected in the peritonitis group. The low molecular weight dextran Ringer group did not show a significant increase in the pulmonary DTPA clearance and the intrapulmonary transferrin accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Utilizing the anatomic, diagnostic protocol modified to include prolonged esophageal pH monitoring (EPM), the causes of cough were determined in 101 of 102 (99%) patients, leading to specific therapy that was successful in 98%. Cough was due to one condition in 73%, two in 23%, and three in 3%. Postnasal drip syndrome was a cause 41% of the time, asthma 24%, gastroesophageal reflux (GER) 21%, chronic bronchitis 5%, bronchiectasis 4%, and miscellaneous conditions 5%. Cough was the sole presenting manifestation of asthma and GER 28 and 43% of the time, respectively. While history, physical examination, methacholine inhalational challenge (MIC), and EPM yielded the most frequent true positive results, MIC was falsely positive 22% of the time in predicting that asthma was the cause of cough. Laboratory testing was particularly useful in ruling out suspected possibilities. We conclude that the anatomic diagnostic protocol is still valid and that it has well-defined strengths and limitations.\r"

Recently we have described a histamine release inhibitory factor (HRIF) that inhibits HRF-induced histamine release from basophils and mast cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of these cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid from normal subjects. We found that BAL fluids from 12 to 17 volunteers contained a dialyzable (molecular weight cutoff 3500) factor that inhibited basophil histamine release by HRF, anti-IgE, concanavalin A, and N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP). In addition, BAL fluids from 83% of the tested donors contained a nondialyzable inhibitor that blocked HRF-induced histamine release from basophils. The molecular weight of this inhibitor was estimated to be 20 to 30 and 8 to 10 kD by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and TSK 2000 size-exclusion HPLC. None of the unconcentrated BAL fluids showed any HRF activity on initial screening using basophils from allergic subjects. However, when the BAL fluids were concentrated, all BAL samples that were tested (N = 10) demonstrated significant HRF activity. The molecular weight of BAL HRF has been estimated to be in the range of 15 to 25 kD by size-exclusion HPLC, similar to the HRF synthesized by mononuclear cells. Thus we have demonstrated the presence of both HRF and HRIF in the BAL fluids. We speculate that these cytokines may be involved in the local regulation of basophil and mast cell activation.\r"

We determined if one of these attractants is neutrophil attractant/activating protein (NAP-1), which is secreted by blood monocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Alveolar macrophages were stimulated in tissue culture with 10 micrograms/ml LPS. Culture fluids collected at 24 h were assayed for both neutrophil chemotactic activity and the concentration of NAP-1 as determined by a sandwich ELISA. The concentration of NAP-1 in culture fluid to LPS-stimulated macrophages was 860 +/- 40 ng/ml (SEM for six normal subjects). NAP-1 in fluid of unstimulated macrophages was 40 +/- 15 ng/ml. We confirmed the presence of NAP-1 in culture fluid of LPS-stimulated lung macrophages by immunoaffinity and HPLC-CM column purification. The HPLC-CM elution profile of macrophage NAP-1 was identical to that of monocyte NAP-1, and the N-terminal sequence of the protein in one of the isolated peaks corresponded to that of monocyte-derived NAP-1 beta. Two lines of evidence show that NAP-1 does not account for all neutrophil chemotactic activity in culture fluid of 24-h, LPS-stimulated macrophages. At a dilution of culture fluid that elcited the same chemotactic response as a known concentration of pure NAP-1, the concentration of culture fluid NAP-1 was only one-tenth that of pure NAP-1.

We examined tissue specimens from four patients with fatal asthma, 10 patients with chronic sinusitis, and 10 patients with nasal polyposis for the presence of elastase, as well as eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP). Neutrophil infiltration and extracellular elastase deposition in association with damage to respiratory epithelium were generally sparse in most specimens; the exceptions were one patient with asthma, one patient with chronic sinusitis, and two patients with nasal polyposis. In contrast, eosinophil infiltration and extracellular MBP deposition were generally marked in most specimens; the exceptions were one patient with asthma and one patient with nasal polyps where extracellular MBP deposition did not coincide with damage to respiratory epithelium. The results suggest that the neutrophil does not usually infiltrate tissues showing allergic inflammation; however, on occasion, it may participate in these inflammatory reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Communication between cells determines the steady-state composition of the lung in health and becomes a critical determinant of outcome in pathologic processes resulting in anatomic remodeling. This review presents the evolving concepts of the biology of cytokines (also known as peptide growth factors or biological response modifiers) in maintaining normal tissue growth and homeostasis. How these extracellular signaling proteins are involved in such pathologic disorders as spontaneous pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, and the evolution and recovery from acute lung injury is also discussed. During the past decade the cytokines have come to the fore as important multifunctional mediators of cell behavior and cell-cell communication. A wide range of cellular responses are influenced or triggered when cytokines interact with cells. These include mitosis, chemotaxis, angiogenesis, cytoskeleton arrangement, immunomodulation, and extracellular matrix production. Cytokines influence cell behavior by binding to specific high affinity surface receptors on target cells. These receptors are linked in turn at the cell membrane to a complex array of intracellular signaling pathways. Individual cytokines may inhibit as well as promote cellular functions such as mitosis and thereby play a critical role in homeostasis of normal tissue elements. Hence, cytokines are intimately involved in normal tissue homeostasis as well as in processes eventuating in growth and remodeling. All cells produce and secrete cytokines at some time during their life. Each cytokine is capable of modulating more than one cellular function. Although produced by a variety of cell types, the triggers that induce a specific cytokine to be produced differ between cells. Many of the cytokines share regions of homologous nucleic acid sequences, suggesting that they are members of larger gene families. Given that tissues and cells are exposed to complex cytokine mixtures rather than to individual cytokines, recent attention has turned to understanding how cytokines interact. The combined effects of cytokine mixtures have proved to be both complex and unpredictable based on knowledge of the separate actions of the individual cytokines involved. In studies of the role of cytokines in lung disease, early research attention has focused on those cytokines released by alveolar macrophages (the so-called macrophage-derived growth factors). However, structural cells as well as immune effector cells of the lung are capable of cytokine production and release. The cytokines receiving the most attention to date in relation to pulmonary diseases include platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin-1 (IL-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I), and, most recently, interleukin-6 (IL-6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Activation of a variety of cell surface receptors results in a biphasic increase in the cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, due to the release or mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores and to the entry of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. Stimulation of these same receptors also results in the hydrolysis of the minor plasma membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, with the concomitant formation of (1,4,5)inositol trisphosphate [(1,4,5)IP3] and diacylglycerol. It is well established that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis is responsible for the changes in Ca2+ homeostasis. There is strong evidence that (1,4,5)IP3 stimulates Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. The Ca2(+)-releasing actions of (1,4,5)IP3 are terminated by its metabolism through two distinct pathways: (1,4,5)IP3 is dephosphorylated by a 5-phosphatase to (1,4)IP2; alternatively, (1,4,5)IP3 is phosphorylated to (1,3,4,5)IP4 by a 3-kinase. Whereas the mechanism of Ca2+ mobilization is understood, the precise mechanisms involved in Ca2+ entry are not known. A recent proposal that (1,4,5)IP3, by emptying an intracellular Ca2+ pool, secondarily elicits Ca2+ entry will be considered. This review summarizes recent studies of the mechanisms by which inositol phosphates regulate cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations.\r"

To date, most receptors in airway smooth muscle appear to be coupled via G proteins to these effector systems: PI turnover, adenylate cyclase, or phospholipase C. Qualitative and quantitative estimates of receptor proteins and the nature and efficiency of coupling to these effector mechanisms need to be linked to physiologic function and the regulation of airway smooth muscle response in health and disease.\r"

  ".W": "Adherence, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and responses to cytokines are mediated by distinct classes of cell surface receptors in human neutrophils. Intracellular signaling by these different receptors is a subject of active investigation. Observation of single neutrophils adherent to surfaces reveals the presence of spontaneous oscillations of cytosolic-free calcium, [Ca2+]i, generated by mechanisms that are presently unknown. Chemoattractant receptor activation via a specific G-regulatory protein activates a plasma membrane phospholipase C and generates diacylglycerol and inositol(1,4,5)triphosphate. DG activates C kinase(s). Ins(1,4,5)P3 releases Ca2+ from a specific intracellular organelle, the calciosome. Calciosomes resemble sarcoplasmic reticulum: they contain a Ca2(+)-ATPase and a high capacity/low affinity calcium-binding, calsequestrin-like protein. Chemoattractant receptor stimulation of calcium influx across the plasma membrane in phagocytes correlates strongly with the conversion of Ins(1,3,4,5)P3 to Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 by a Ca2(+)-calmodulin-sensitive kinase. The transduction system of phagocytosis receptors also generates DG and Ins(1,4,5)P3 and elicits [Ca2+]i elevations. The Ca2+ signal is an important regulator of secretion (granule exocytosis, superoxide production), whereas C kinase(s)/and other unknown mediators appear to be more important for the control of movement. Several mechanisms that could account for the specificity of cell signaling by different receptors are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90178867\r", 
  ".W": "Endothelial cells, situated at the interface of blood and the tissues, are ideally positioned to receive circulating and tissue-derived stimuli and equally to affect underlying cell types of the vascular wall. Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells show a close morphologic association via myoendothelial junctions and also interact via soluble mediators. We have begun to investigate the stimulus-secretion coupling using agonists that elicit the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors and have particularly focused on the role of Ca2+. In addition, we have examined the effects of endothelium-derived constrictor substances from both large and small pulmonary vessels. On account of the intimate association between microvessels and the airway wall, we have also examined the effects of endothelium-derived constrictors on tracheal smooth muscle and have shown that conditioned media from pulmonary artery and from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells constrict both coronary artery rings and tracheal smooth muscle strips. The characteristics of the response are similar to the actions of the 21 amino acid peptide endothelin. Thus, endothelial cells regulate the levels of circulating vasoactive substances via their surface enzymes while, via their surface receptors, they are capable of being stimulated to release substances with effects on vascular tone and airway responses.\r"

  ".U": "90178868\r", 
  ".W": "Contraction of airway smooth muscle (ASM) results from an increase in cytoplasmic free Ca2+ and appears to be independent of changes in membrane potential or the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), the product of receptor-mediated hydrolysis of a membrane phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, is capable of releasing Ca2+ from intracellular stores in this tissue and has been proposed as the intracellular second messenger responsible for agonist-induced changes in cytosolic Ca2+ and hence contraction. In this report, we discuss the evidence for this signaling system in ASM and present new data on mass changes in Ins(1,4,5)P3 in carbachol-stimulated bovine tracheal smooth muscle. The rapid, transient accumulation of this second messenger in ASM is thought to reflect regulation of the enzymes involved in the metabolism rather than the synthesis of this inositol polyphosphate. The potential mechanisms of this regulation are discussed in relation to the initiation and maintenance of contraction in ASM.\r"

  ".W": "Airway submucosal glands are by volume the most important source of macromolecules in airway secretions. These secretions, containing gel-forming mucins, antibacterial proteins, and antiproteases, comprise the major defensive barrier protecting the host against airborne pathogens. The identification of the mechanisms regulating secretion from the submucosal glands is key to understanding the genesis of this barrier and how it is altered by disease processes. Using a variety of methods, we and others have identified on the gland cells of several species receptors specific for ACh, norepinephrine, substance P, VIP, PGE1, PGE2, PGA1, PGD2, histamine and bradykinin. These receptors all participate in modulating the secretory activity of the airway submucosal glands. Studies of homogeneous cultures of bovine airway serous cells have yielded detailed information regarding the beta-adrenergic receptor on these cells. Using radioligand binding techniques, we found evidence for the presence of a single high affinity beta receptor of beta-2 subtype. Occupancy of this receptor by isoproterenol causes an elevation in the concentration of intracellular cAMP, which in turn stimulates the phosphorylation of a subset of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. Based on the kinetics and pharmacology of these effects, it is likely that cAMP functions as a second messenger in the serous cell secretory pathway, probably acting through protein kinases. Current efforts are directed at identification of those phosphoproteins whose phosphorylation and dephosphorylation times are consistent with their possible roles in secretion.\r"

However, the deterioration of lung beta-adrenoceptor function is not invariably associated with lung inflammation. Severe asthmatics, but not asthmatics per se, show a diminished beta-adrenoceptor function of airway smooth muscle. These changes are probably a consequence of the active disease state rather than an intrinsic component of asthma. Mediators released from inflammatory cells such as reactive oxygen species and fatty acid metabolites may directly or indirectly induce beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction. Beta-adrenoceptor function of leukocytes from asthmatic patients can be decreased as well and it is suggested that lymphokines like interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma may affect beta-adrenoceptor function. A disturbed beta-adrenoceptor function on inflammatory cells themselves may have consequences for their immune function, mediator release, and effect on surrounding tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Airway tissue obtained postmortem from nondiseased and severely asthmatic human lung was used in functional, radioligand binding and autoradiographic studies to investigate aspects of various receptor systems for putative mediators of asthma. Results indicate that asthma does not involve an intrinsic abnormality of smooth muscle contractility to spasmogens. Nor was there any evidence for up-regulation of histamine H1-receptor, muscarinic cholinoceptor, or alpha 1-adrenoceptor function. Conversely, severe asthma involving intense airway inflammation resulted in significant beta-adrenoceptor dysfunction, probably caused by receptor uncoupling from adenylate cyclase. Evidence was also obtained for histamine and methacholine-induced release of a nonprostanoid, airway epithelium-derived inhibitory factor (EpDIF), which may have a significant dilator effect in the adjacent bronchial circulation. The activity of this potentially protective inhibitory autacoid system would be expected to be reduced in asthma, which commonly involves epithelium damage. The autoradiographic distribution of specific binding sites for 125I-labeled substance P (I-SP) was also determined in bronchi from healthy humans and asthmatics. In sharp contrast to guinea pig airways where high levels of binding were detected over smooth muscle, specific I-SP binding was sparse over human airway smooth muscle from both sources, while dense binding was associated with structures immediately beneath the epithelium and with deep submucosal glands. These data suggest a more significant role for SP in secretory processes than in spasmogenic processes in human bronchi and highlight the potential for drawing invalid conclusions concerning human airway function from studies using animal models.\r"

In asthmatic patients, beta-adrenergic hyporesponsiveness and alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic hyperresponsiveness can be frequently demonstrated. These observations have provided support for the beta blockade theory of asthma, advanced in the late 1960s by Andor Szentivanyi's experiments involving sensitized rodents. However, in addition to asthma, aberrations in autonomic nervous system function have been noted in other individuals including cystic fibrosis patients and their parents, patients with emphysema and bronchitis, and in patients (allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis) who have demonstrable IgE antibody responses to a variety of antigens. Thus, although these defects are not specific for asthma, it is noteworthy that these conditions share many clinical features; the ultimate phenotypic expression of these abnormalities may depend on both genetic and environmental factors that have yet to be defined.\r"

Knowledge of the primary structure of receptors has allowed for prediction of secondary structure and the construction of three-dimensional models. Permanent expression of cloned neurotransmitter receptor genes in cultured cells is providing unlimited sources of pure receptor, which allows for pharmacological and biochemical studies on single receptor subtypes. The use of site-directed mutagenesis to elucidate the relationship between protein structure and function has provided considerable information on the role of certain conserved amino acids in receptor function and has suggested possible molecular mechanisms of signal transduction across membranes. The article will review some of these recent developments in the area of neurotransmitter receptors and point out the utility of molecular biology in these endeavors.\r"

PATIENTS: Patients were eligible if Mycobacterium tuberculosis, isolated from sputum cultures, was susceptible to study drugs. Of 1451 patients enrolled, 75% (617 of 823) assigned to the 6-month regimen and 71% (445 of 628) assigned to the 9-month regimen were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients took self-administered isoniazid and rifampin daily for 24 weeks (6-month regimen) or 36 weeks (9-month regimen). In addition, patients assigned to the 6-month regimen took self-administered pyrazinamide daily during the first 8 weeks. RESULTS: Patients on the 6-month regimen converted more rapidly than patients on the 9-month regimen (94.6% compared with 89.9% after 16 weeks of therapy, with a difference of 4.7% [95% CI, 0.7% to 8.7%]); had similar rates of adverse drug reactions (7.7% compared with 6.4%, with a difference of 1.3% [95% CI, 0.0% to 4.6%]); had lower noncompliance rates (16.8% compared with 29.2%, with a difference of 12.4% [95% CI, 6.8% to 18.0%]); and had similar relapse rates 96 weeks after completing therapy (3.5% compared with 2.8%, with a difference of 0.7% [95% CI, 0.0% to 3.9%]). A significantly greater proportion of patients assigned to the 6-month regimen successfully completed therapy (61.4% compared with 50.6%; chi 2 = 11.976).

Subclavian, innominate, and superior vena cava venograms were done at onset of thrombosis symptoms or after 90 days in the study. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one patients entered the study, and 82 patients completed the study. Of 42 patients completing the study while receiving warfarin, 4 had venogram-proven thrombosis. All 4 had symptoms from thrombosis. Of 40 patients completing the study while not receiving warfarin, 15 had venogram-proven thrombosis, and 10 had symptoms from thrombosis (P less than 0.001). There were no measurable changes in the coagulation values assayed due to this warfarin dose, except in occasional patients who had become anorectic because of their disease or chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Very low doses of warfarin can protect against thrombosis without inducing a hemorrhagic state. This approach may be applicable to other groups of patients.\r"

SETTING: Esophageal motility and pH probe placement was done in the gastroenterology unit at Bowman Gray Medical Center. Running was done on local jogging trials. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: There was more gastroesophageal reflux during running than during the baseline hour when reflux was measured at a pH threshold of 3.0, 4.0, or 5.0 (P less than 0.05). Reflux episodes were usually associated with belching. Ranitidine, 300 mg administered orally 1 hour before running, significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced the amount of esophageal acid exposure during running.

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published in the English literature from 1978 through 1989 were identified using Index Medicus and cross searching of bibliographies. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies of five or more patients for general analysis and smaller studies and case reports when pertinent. To develop criteria for the corticotropin-release hormone (CRH) stimulation test, only studies reporting individual patient data were analyzed. RESULTS: No new test is clearly better than existing tests in establishing a definitive diagnosis. Among tests to determine cause, the CRH stimulation test, by newly developed criteria, has a 91% sensitivity (95% CI, 85% to 95%) and a 95% specificity (CI, 82% to 99%), and the overnight high-dose dexamethasone suppression test has an 89% sensitivity (CI, 80% to 94%) and a 100% specificity (CI, 84% to 100%) for the pituitary Cushing syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging has greater sensitivity for detecting adrenocorticotropin (ACTH)-producing pituitary adenomas than computed tomography. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling can correctly identify a pituitary cause in 88% (CI, 79% to 94%) of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis is still best established by using 24-hour urine free cortisol measurements or low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. The CRH stimulation test is an outpatient alternative to determine cause, and the over-night high-dose dexamethasone test may become the test of choice along with plasma ACTH measurements by radioimmunoassay in the initial evaluation of cause. Magnetic resonance imaging should be used to evaluate the pituitary Cushing syndrome, and inferior petrosal sinus sampling is most useful in problematic cases with uncertain cause.\r"

  ".W": "Unilateral vestibular injury evokes a characteristic pattern of acute disorganization of posture, locomotion, and eye movements. Following this acute stage, functional recovery occurs. In the present study, unilateral labyrinthectomy and vestibular neurectomy were performed in cats. The lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN) and vestibular nerve root entry zone on both sides of the brain stem were examined 24 hours, 3 days, and 8 weeks after operation by use of an immunochemical astrocyte marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The results demonstrate extensive GFAP immunoreactivity within the ipsilateral nerve root following neurectomy, but not after labyrinthectomy. Prominent GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytic processes were detected in the LVN both ipsilateral and contralateral to neurectomy and labyrinthectomy. Within the ipsilateral LVN, the intensity of GFAP immunoreactivity was greater following neurectomy than after labyrinthectomy, but the pattern of GFAP reactivity remained similar. In the contralateral LVN, GFAP reactivity was noted exclusively in the dorsal-rostral region corresponding to the zone of cerebellar afferents to the LVN. The results of the present study suggest that reactive astroglia may play an important role in the mechanism that leads to vestibular compensation.\r"

The carcinoma shares many features with undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinomas, from which it must be distinguished: histologic appearance, putative relationship with Epstein-Barr virus, predilection for mongoloid races, and response to therapy. In some cases, the carcinoma appears to have evolved from a lymphoepithelial lesion.\r"

  ".W": "The role of cellular proto-oncogene activation in shortwave UV light in the B range (UV-B)--induced skin carcinogenesis was investigated. Epidermal papillomas and carcinomas were induced on the depilated skin surface of Sencar mice with single-dose UV-B irradiation (7 x 10(4) J/m2). The tumors thus initiated were present in 18.8% of treated animals and were primarily benign papillomas, while a few (6 of 17) progressed to form squamous cell carcinomas. A 5- to 10-fold stimulation of cHa-ras gene expression in both papillomas and carcinomas was observed. Other cellular proto-oncogenes such as cKi-ras, c-myc, or c-fos specific messenger RNAs were not detected in these UV-B--induced skin tumors. Subsequent Southern blot analysis revealed a threefold to fivefold amplification of cHa-ras gene in skin papillomas and carcinomas. However, only the carcinoma and not the papilloma DNA induced foci in the classic NIH-3T3 transformation assay, suggesting that activation of cHa-ras gene alone is not sufficient to exhibit this phenotypic expression of transformed cells. The NIH-3T3 transformants exhibited (1) anchorage independent growth on soft agar, (2) tumor induction in athymic mice, and (3) overexpression and amplification of the cHa-ras gene. We propose that overexpression of a ras gene by gene amplification plays a role in the UV-B--induced skin carcinogenesis process.\r"

The epidermis showed prominent changes, including intense expression of HLA-DR on keratinocytes, increase in epidermal cell layers, moderate to high Langerhans cell hyperplasia, and infiltration by CD3+ pan-T cells as well as CD8+ (cytotoxic/suppressor) and CD4+ (helper/inducer) T cells. The predominant lymphocyte in the dermal granulomas was the activated CD3+ T cell, expressing major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and interleukin 2 receptor. CD4+ and CD8+ cells were randomly distributed among the epithelioid cells, which showed intense staining for major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. In all except two patients, the CD4+ population was greater than that of the CD8+ cells. CD1+ Langerhans cells were scattered in moderate numbers in the dermal granulomas. Acid-fast bacilli were conspicuously absent in the biopsy specimens. These features suggest that T-cell activation and Langerhans cell hyperplasia are prominent features of dermal tuberculosis.\r"

Recent results of experimental in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as evidence obtained through the clinical use of cyclosporine in humans, strongly suggest that cyclosporine may exert a direct effect on the growth of several epithelial cell types. Thus, cyclosporine, while stimulating the growth of hair follicle keratinocytes with a resulting hypertrichosis, appears to exert a cytostatic effect on several epithelial cell types of human and animal origin. This antiproliferative effect is shared by some minimally immunosuppressive or nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporine analogues, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms that modulate epithelial cell growth differ from those responsible for immunosuppression. This newly discovered pharmacologic property of cyclosporine may hopefully lead to the wider use of nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporines in the treatment of hyperproliferative epidermal diseases.\r"

These effects are similar to those of endotoxin as well as the eicosanoids. A specific PAF receptor antagonist, BN52021, was used to determine its effects on the hemodynamic events, the eicosanoid production, and on survival in severe rat endotoxemia. Endotoxin alone significantly produced hypotension, prostaglandins (TxB2, PGE2) release, and death. In contrast pretreatment with BN52021, a specific PAF receptor antagonist, significantly altered the hypotension, significantly attenuated the eicosanoid release, and improved the survival rate (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that PAF receptor activation is an early event in endotoxemia. Eicosanoid release in endotoxemia could be related to PAF synthesis and PAF receptor activation. These findings support the hypothesis that there may be an intimate relationship between PAF and the eicosanoids and that in endotoxemia some of the effects of PAF may be mediated via the cyclo-oxygenase pathway.\r"

Three series of experiments were performed. In the first series of experiments, mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, and amino acid uptake in incubated soleus muscles were measured after intravenous injection of endotoxin (1 mg/kg) in male Sprague-Dawley rats (40 to 60 g). Amino acid transport was measured by determining intracellular uptake of [3H]-alpha-amino-isobutyric acid (AIB) during 2 hours of incubation. In the second series of experiments, hypotension was induced by bleeding and muscle amino acid uptake was measured. In the third series of experiments, whole plasma or a low molecular weight fraction (less than 10,000 d) of plasma from endotoxin-injected rats was added in vitro to incubated muscles and amino acid uptake was determined. One hour after injection of endotoxin, MAP was reduced from 80 +/- 2 mmHg to 54 +/- 4 mmHg (p less than 0.05). AIB uptake was reduced by 20% (p less than 0.05) 2 hours after endotoxin injection. When MAP was maintained at 50 mmHg for 1 hour by bleeding, no changes in muscle AIB uptake were noted. When plasma obtained from rats 2 hours after endotoxin injection was added to incubated soleus muscles, AIB uptake was reduced by 22%. This effect was duplicated by a fraction of endotoxic plasma containing substances with a molecular weight less than 10,000 d. The present results suggest that reduced muscle amino acid uptake during endotoxemia is not due to associated hypotension, but may be caused by a circulating factor(s) with a molecular weight less than 10,000 d.\r"

Long-term survival, the incidence of rejection, and the incidence of infection are still being defined. From 1985 to 1989, 21 children aged 6 months to 19 years (average age, 11.2 years) underwent cardiac transplantation at our institutions. Eighteen survived the operative period and have been followed for 5 to 49 months (average follow-up, 24 months). All operative survivors have received triple-drug immunosuppression consisting of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone. During follow-up, 7 patients have been treated on 12 occasions for rejection as documented by endomyocardial biopsy. Eight (67%) of the 12 episodes of rejection occurred in the presence of subtherapeutic cyclosporine levels. Two of the 7 patients treated for rejection have subsequently died of ongoing cardiac rejection and arrhythmia. There have been no perioperative or late deaths from infection. Bacterial sepsis was identified and treated twice during follow-up, viral infections on five occasions, and fungal infection once. Actuarial 1-year survival and 3-year survival of the 18 operative survivors are 94% and 78%, respectively. In the first 7 months after cardiac transplantation, 73% of patients were free from rejection and 83% were free from serious bloodborne infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Highly selected patients with obstructing neoplasms of the esophagus and airway can be palliated and sometimes cured by this aggressive surgical approach. Fatal hemorrhage from pressure or exposure of the innominate artery is avoided by elective division of the artery (preoperative angiograms and intraoperative electroencephalographic control are essential), using the omentum to separate the trachea and great vessels, and removal of a bony plaque of chest wall to allow a well-vascularized bipedicled skin flap to drop into the mediastinum for the tracheocutaneous anastomosis. Eighteen exenterations were performed. Mediastinal tracheostomy was performed in 14 patients and division of the innominate artery was performed in 7. Esophageal replacement was predominantly with the left colon. Complications include esophageal leak (2 patients), stomal separation (2), transient hemiplegia (1), colonic obstruction by substernal tunnel (1), and need for prolonged mechanical ventilation (4). There was a single operative death. Postoperative survival was disease dependent. All patients achieved an excellent airway and relief from dysphagia.\r"

As compared with recipients without bronchiolitis obliterans, patients with it showed a significant increase in the number of S100-protein-positive dendritic cells in the tracheal and bronchial epithelium and submucosa of the donor organs.

Both had received radiotherapy (more than 6,000 rads) for treatment of Hodgkin's disease 17 (patient 2) and 20 years (patient 1) earlier. At the time of operation, the patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III-IV or IV. Preoperative catheterization showed the following pressures for patients 1 and 2, respectively: right atrial, 30 and 14 mm Hg; right ventricular end-diastolic, 28 and 14 mm Hg; wedge, 29 and 13 mm Hg; and left ventricular end-diastolic, 27 and 14 mm Hg. Complete epicardiectomy and pericardiectomy was attempted in both patients. However, hospital mortality was 100%; patient 1 died of multiorgan failure after six days, and patient 2 died of biventricular failure after 3 months. A review of the literature revealed 44 cases of pericardiectomy for postirradiation constrictive pericarditis and a late survival rate of less than 50%. The poor results in these patients compared with patients having pericardiectomy for other reasons seem to be due mainly to the various kinds of radiation-induced damage to the heart as a whole, including untimely coronary artery disease, myocardial fibrosis, atrioventricular conduction disturbances, and valve dysfunction, with the result that complete relief by epicardiectomy and pericardiectomy may not be technically feasible.\r"

  ".W": "Many renal structural and functional abnormalities have been associated with sickle cell disease. The patients have an impaired urinary concentrating ability but an intact diluting capacity. There are defects in both urinary acidification and potassium excretion, although overt metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia occur infrequently. Proximal tubular function is supranormal, as manifested by increased reabsorption of phosphate and increased secretion of creatinine. The former results in mild hyperphosphatemia, while the latter causes substantial overestimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by creatinine clearance. Both GFR and renal plasma flow are increased in young patients with sickle cell disease, but prostaglandin inhibitors decrease the GFR. The GFR progressively decreases with increasing age. Proteinuria, and even nephrotic syndrome, are relatively frequent; the most common renal lesion in children is focal glomerular sclerosis, which may be associated with progressive deterioration in renal function. Glomerular hyperfiltration has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the glomerular lesions, as well as in the development of renal failure. In patients with end-stage renal disease, both hemodialysis and kidney transplantation have been successful. Recurrent hematuria is a relatively common problem in patients with sickle cell disease. The bleeding usually remits spontaneously, but occasionally requires therapy with aminocaproic acid. Papillary necrosis may occur, and is thought to result from medullary ischemia.\r"

Differentiation of primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon from the thoracic outlet syndrome and from the carpal tunnel syndrome pose potential diagnostic difficulties. Despite growing public recognition of upper extremity problems caused by repetitive trauma, there have been few investigations of vibration-induced disorders in the United States. This is not true worldwide, particularly in Northern Europe, where there has been significant intervention in medical surveillance and tool design. There does appear to be, however, frequent misdiagnosis and misdirected surgery. This has particular significance for the clinician, since in the 1990s, cumulative trauma injuries are expected to exceed all other work-related injuries.\r"

Issues in distribution involve access to the transplant waiting list and use of the new national point system to select recipients from the list. These public policies are relevant for internists, who often care for potential organ donors and patients with end-stage renal disease. The issues are also relevant for policy-minded physicians because renal transplantation is the paradigm for organ transplant policy.\r"

  ".W": "Renovascular hypertension is potentially curable but of low prevalence. A previous retrospective study has demonstrated the use of a potentiated increase in plasma renin activity after captopril administration as a diagnostic test for renovascular hypertension; this requires two blood samples for plasma renin activity determination and three inclusive criteria for a positive test result. We applied this test prospectively to screen 100 hypertensive patients for renovascular hypertension. We evaluated 29 patients with renovascular hypertension; the remainder were diagnosed as having essential hypertension. In our patient population, a postcaptopril plasma renin activity of 5.7 ng of angiotensin per milliliter per hour (ngAl.mL-1.h-1) or greater had a 100% sensitivity and an 80% specificity for renovascular hypertension. An absolute increase in plasma renin activity with captopril of 4.7 ngAl.mL-1.h-1 or greater had a lower sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 87%, whereas a fractional increase in plasma renin activity after captopril of 150% or higher had the lowest sensitivity of 69% and a specificity of 86%. A subgroup analysis of 38 patients who were receiving diuretic therapy demonstrated that the test sensitivity was unchanged but the specificity was reduced. In conclusion, a single postcaptopril plasma renin activity value of 5.7 ngAl.mL-1.h-1 or greater is a simplified screening test for renovascular hypertension, with excellent sensitivity and acceptable specificity. This test is well tolerated, inexpensive, and easy to perform.\r"

Therefore, we prospectively studied the value of this test in 149 consecutive hypertensive patients. The test was considered positive if plasma renin activity, after an oral dose of 25 mg of captopril, rose by more then 4.44 ng.L-1.s-1 (16.0 ng/mL per hour). The sensitivity of the test was 39%, the specificity was 96%, the positive predictive value was 81%, and the negative predictive value was 79%. No clinically important cutoff point identifying patients with renal artery stenosis could be detected in the values of baseline and stimulated plasma renin activity nor in baseline blood pressure or changes after captopril testing. The low sensitivity makes the captopril test unfit to be used as a screening procedure in an unselected hypertensive population.\r"

  ".W": "Both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists and opiate-receptor antagonists have been shown to limit tissue damage after ischemic central nervous system injury. We compared the neuroprotective effects of the noncompetitive NMDA-receptor antagonist MK-801 and the opiate-receptor antagonist nalmefene in a model of global spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion in unanesthetized rabbits. MK-801 (1 mg/kg) or nalmefene (0.1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 5 minutes after reperfusion. MK-801 treatment and nalmefene treatment each significantly improved the neurologic and histologic outcome compared with saline controls. Differences in these outcome measures between MK-801 treatment and nalmefene treatment did not reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that multiple factors, including endogenous opioids and excitatory amino acids, contribute to the secondary tissue injury after central nervous system ischemia. These data also provide further evidence that therapeutic interventions with opiate-receptor antagonists or NMDA antagonists may be beneficial in limiting neurologic dysfunction after ischemic brain or spinal cord injury.\r"

Minimum conduction velocity is a sensitive measure of both axonal and demyelinating peripheral nerve pathology. Activity-dependent conduction is another aspect of sensory conduction that may provide additional information for the clinician. Refractory period of transmission has been used to diagnose subtle demyelinating lesions, as well as some axonal disorders. Supernormal period and the conduction of trains of stimuli may also be useful, although, at present, they remain predominantly research tools.\r"

Inflammation was assessed by measuring fluorescein leakage into the anterior chamber using fluorophotometry techniques. Increased leakage in each patient's operated-on eye compared with the unoperated-on control eye was attributed to a breakdown in the blood-aqueous barrier caused by the cataract surgery. Elimination or significant reduction of fluorescein leakage within a treatment group constituted increased efficacy in controlling inflammation. A total of 124 cases were analyzed. There were no preoperative differences among groups in fluorescein leakage. At 1 week after surgery, all three diclofenac groups had significantly less fluorescein leakage compared with the prednisolone group. Mean percent increases were 56% to 118% in diclofenac groups vs 324% in the prednisolone group. No differences among diclofenac concentrations were detected. The differences between prednisolone and diclofenac were also present, although of lesser magnitude, at 3 weeks. This demonstration of increased efficacy of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent vs prednisolone is promising given the known side effects of ocular steroids.\r"

Alcohol and Alcoholism 23, 225-227, 1988) has suggested that in the U.S.A. opposition from the disease model has been the main reason for the limited application of the alcohol dependence syndrome. In Britain, the charge that the syndrome is a poorly disguised version of the disease model has had a similar effect. This paper describes the main features of the crude biomedical disease model, which critics equate with the alcohol dependence syndrome. It is concluded that the alcohol dependence syndrome does not conform to this, in that it is not presented by its proponents as a discrete entity identified by a core psycho-biological pathology and carries no built-in assumptions about causal processes. It is argued that instead of setting-up and championing competing all-embracing conceptual models, both clinicians and researchers should be flexible and imaginative in their use of concepts.\r"

A pattern of selective muscle involvement was consistently found. Ultrasonography revealed abnormally high muscle echogenicity. In contrast to the controls with simple disuse and/or neurogenic atrophy, CT revealed low muscle density in our patients. MRI confirmed that this pattern reflects patchy, fatty degeneration, a new finding in congenital nemaline myopathy. Ultrasonography appears useful for screening, provided that the dorsiflexors of the feet are examined. CT and MRI can be used to demonstrate abnormalities in mild cases, to select the biopsy site, and for follow-up. MRI, because it provides good soft tissue contrast, is useful for determining fatty infiltration.\r"

Dystrophin is demonstrably absent with immunocytochemical staining and undetectable by western blotting of DMD muscles. We report an isolated 7-year-old girl with DMD. Analysis of the patient's and her mother's DNA, with probes covering the DMD gene, disclosed no deletion. We have studied dystrophin in biopsied muscle from the patient using antidystrophin antibody in combination with immunofluorescence. Random presence of normal and dystrophin-deficient fibers were indicative of mosaic expression. Dystrophin immunocytochemistry may be useful for accurate diagnosis of affected females.\r"

  ".W": "Mitral annular apical systolic excursion or descent of the base (DB) of the left ventricle has been qualitatively observed by two-dimensional echocardiography studies to decrease as left ventricular systolic function deteriorates. On the basis of this observation a quantitative assessment of DB was examined as a means to estimate left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Two-dimensional echocardiographic apical images were obtained in 100 subjects, 26 normal individuals and 74 clinical patients. Major diagnoses in the clinical patients were dilated cardiomyopathy in 24, coronary artery disease in 13, valvular disease in 16, left ventricular hypertrophy in 8, and no evident heart disease in 12. Wall motion was visually assessed; 22 subjects had a segmental wall motion abnormality, and 21 had a diffuse wall motion abnormality. All patients had a complete Doppler examination, and 31 had mitral and/or aortic regurgitation judged to be 2+ (moderate) or greater in severity. To quantitate DB the difference of the distance from the apex of the sector fan to the middle-mitral annular plane between end-diastole and end-systole in both two- and four-chamber views was calculated. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume and LVEF were calculated with a modified Simpson's rule algorithm applied to planimetered apical two- and four-chamber images. The mean DB of the normal subjects was 12 +/- 2 mm with both two- and four-chamber images. All normal subjects had a DB of 8 mm or greater. LVEF in percentage was linearly related to DB (millimeters) as follows. Two-chamber view, LVEF = 3.8 DB + 21; r = 0.78; standard error of the estimate = 14% Four-chamber view, LVEF = 4.1 DB + 17; r = 0.84; standard error of the estimate = 12% A four-chamber DB of less than 8 mm was associated with a depressed LVEF (less than 50%) with 82% specificity and 98% sensitivity. DB for a given LVEF was slightly increased in patients with 2+ or greater mitral and/or aortic regurgitation (p less than 0.001). Similarly, DB for a given LVEF in patients with a diffuse wall motion abnormality was slightly increased compared with those patients with a segmental wall motion abnormality (p less than 0.001). Comparison of left ventricular end-diastolic volume to DB showed a poor linear correlation. In conclusion, DB quantitation provides a useful, noninvasive method to estimate LVEF.\r"

  ".U": "90180824\r", 
  ".W": "Currently, the coronary angiogram remains the \"gold standard\" for the detection and quantification of coronary arterial disease. Clinical assessment of the arteriogram is usually based simply on the relative percent narrowing of the column of angiographic dye. However, such analysis oversimplifies and is not accurate for evaluating the extent and severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Recently a new generation of ultrasonic devices has become available for intraoperative evaluation of coronary arterial anatomy. These high frequency echocardiographic transducers use 12 MHz probes. The transducer is placed directly over the epicardium during open heart surgery to evaluate the coronary artery. With this technique, demonstration of coronary artery anatomy, including wall and cross-sectional lumen, is available in vivo. We have undertaken numerous validation studies in vitro and in vivo of animal and postmortem human heart preparations to show that this technique can be used to accurately measure luminal area, luminal diameter, and wall thickness. Subsequently in patients intraoperatively the extent of atherosclerosis using luminal diameter to wall thickness (LD/WT) ratios was compared with the routine angiographic evaluation of coronary arterial disease using percent stenosis measurements. LD/WT ratios from arterial segments with no visible angiographic disease but with angiographic lesions elsewhere in the same coronary artery showed marked variability. The majority were in the range of LD/WT ratios of those segments where high frequency echocardiography recording was made at the site of \"angiographic\" disease. This indicates that in vivo atherosclerosis is more widespread than the angiogram predicts and underlies the difficulties of using percent stenosis angiographically to determine the extent and severity of coronary arterial disease. In a second study we have demonstrated that there is marked variability and eccentricity in coronary plaque geometry, luminal morphology, and placement of the residual lumen with respect to the atherosclerotic plaque. This eccentricity results in some relatively \"normal\" coronary wall at the site of maximum atherosclerosis, theoretically preserving the ability to vasodilate and vasoconstrict. Studies with high frequency echocardiography are underway to study the capability of arteries with atherosclerosis to vasodilate. We have evaluated atherosclerotic remodeling of coronary arteries and found that remodeling occurs in an attempt by the artery to preserve its residual luminal size during encroachment on the lumen by the atherosclerotic plaque. This is the first in vivo demonstration of this process in human coronary arteries. Coronary arterial bypass grafts have been evaluated in animal models and at the time of intraoperative coronary anastomoses to evaluate the adequacy of graft anastomoses and compare vein grafts with internal mammary grafts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Currently, no technique can easily provide this information. In this in vitro study we evaluated the potential of a new imaging technique, intravascular high frequency ultrasound angioscopy, in the estimation of percentage of cross-sectional area stenosis of an artery. To do this, we compared intravascular high frequency ultrasound to previously-validated external high frequency ultrasound and to anatomic estimation of arterial stenosis. Using a prototype intraluminal imaging catheter with a 20 MHz ultrasound transducer at its tip, we imaged 20 arterial segments of various size (15 to 90 mm2 lumen area by anatomy) in the control state and after experimental stenosis. These arterial segments were also imaged by external high frequency ultrasound. Lumen areas were measured from calibrated ultrasound images in the control state and after stenosis, and percentage of cross-sectional area stenosis was calculated. These data were compared to the percentage of area stenosis derived from calibrated anatomic photographs of the arteries taken in the control state and after stenosis. Both intravascular ultrasound angioscopy and external high frequency ultrasound yielded high-resolution, two-dimensional, circumferential images of the arteries. Alterations in vessel area and shape were apparent after creation of stenosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a preliminary study 40 patients received a single heparin bolus of 10,000 units (protocol I) and a further 40 patients received both a heparin bolus of 10,000 and a continuous infusion of heparin at a rate of 2000 units per hour (protocol II). During the first 45 minutes, nine patients (23%) in protocol I but only two patients (5%) in protocol II were found to be inadequately anticoagulated. For 24 hours after angioplasty both groups received an infusion of heparin at the rate of 2000 units per hour which led to consistent anticoagulation in 73 (91%) of patients. In a subsequent randomised study, 40 patients received heparin according to either protocol I or II. Protocol II was again found to lead to a higher rate of adequate anticoagulation. During the first 60 minutes 11 patients (55%) in protocol I but only three patients (15%) in protocol II were inadequately anticoagulated. In addition, the activated clotting time of arterial blood in the first 30 minutes was significantly higher than that of venous blood in 70% of the patients. A bolus of heparin (10,000 units) together with an infusion of 2000 units per hour should be routinely given during coronary angioplasty. The effects of heparin, which can vary considerably from patient to patient, should be monitored by the measurement of the activated clotting time of arterial blood.\r"

To avoid overestimating the beneficial effects of treatment in uncontrolled studies, measurements of haemodynamic function are usually performed with patients in the fasting postabsorptive state. But such recordings are not representative of the resting patient during daily life. In this double blind placebo controlled study the short term haemodynamic effects of enalapril were assessed during 12 hours in 19 patients with moderate heart failure caused by dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients ate lunch and dinner and were studied in the absorptive and postabsorptive phases. In the placebo group systemic vascular resistance, mean arterial pressure, and the rate-pressure product fell significantly (5-16%) after lunch. Four hours after lunch the haemodynamic function had returned to baseline--that is the postabsorptive state. Enalapril, accentuated the haemodynamic effects during the absorptive state producing a larger post-prandial fall in mean arterial blood pressure and rate-pressure product and changes in the absorptive phase were maintained into the post-absorptive phase. Pulmonary wedge pressure fell significantly after treatment with enalapril. These overall changes during the study period indicated that enalapril reduced the preload and afterload on the heart--over and above the reduction produced by eating. These findings suggest that the effects of enalapril given at rest to patients with moderate heart failure unload the heart and enhance the reduction of afterload induced by meals.\r"

The lids were graded as minor trichiasis, five or fewer lashes; major trichiasis, six or more lashes; and lid closure defect. Operative success was defined as no lash/eyeball contact and complete gentle lid closure. One hundred and sixty five lids with major trichiasis were allocated by random number tables to one of five operations: bilamellar tarsal rotation (Ballen), tarsal advance and rotation (modified Trabut), eversion splinting (grey line), tarsal advance (lid split), and tarsal grooving (Streatfield-Snellen) operations. Bilamellar tarsal rotation was significantly more successful than eversion splinting (chi 2 = 7.0, p less than 0.01); tarsal advance (chi 2 = 12.4, p less than 0.001), and tarsal grooving (chi 2 = 23.7, p less than 0.001), but not significantly more successful than tarsal advance and rotation (chi 2 = 2.9, p greater than 0.05). Two of 32 (6%) lids with lid closure defect were successfully treated with tarsal advance; trichiasis was relieved in nine and lid closure defect in 10. It is suggested that bilamellar tarsal rotation and tarsal advance and rotation are effective operations for major trichiasis, but tarsal advance is ineffective where trichiasis and lid closure defect coexist.\r"

  ".W": "The alveolar macrophage (AM), as a representative human tissue macrophage, was used in an in vitro system to examine the anti-human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) activity of zidovudine (AZT) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). AMs were infected with the IIIB strain of HIV-1 and exposed to AZT (1 mumol/L), GM-CSF (30 U/mL), a combination of AZT (1 mumol/L)/GM-CSF (30 U/mL), or medium control. At 10 or 20 days post-infection, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBMLs) were added to the AM cultures as stimulated target cells. AZT effectively suppressed HIV replication and prevented transfer/amplification in target PBMLs as long as the drug was maintained in the medium. GM-CSF neither suppressed nor augmented HIV replication. The combination of AZT/GM-CSF was comparable with AZT alone in suppressing both the initial infection of AMs and the transfer to target PBMLs as long as the agents were maintained in the cultures. However, when the drugs were removed at the same time that PHA-stimulated PBMLs were added to the culture, the combination of AZT/GM-CSF was found to be more effective than AZT alone in preventing the transfer/amplification of HIV in the target lymphocytes. These results suggest that (1) AZT is effective in inhibiting HIV-1 infection in mononuclear phagocytes; (2) GM-CSF neither inhibits nor augments the replication of the IIIB strain of HIV in human AMs; and (3) the combination of AZT and GM-CSF may have an enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity compared with AZT alone. Clinical trials with the two agents in combination appear warranted.\r"

  ".U": "90181607\r", 
  ".W": "Administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) to mice with cyclophosphamide (CPA)-induced neutropenia for 4 consecutive days from the day after the CPA dosing (100 mg/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the peripheral blood neutrophil count 6 hours after the final hG-CSF injection. Within the hG-CSF dose range of 0.1 to 10 micrograms per mouse per day, there was a strong linear relationship (r greater than .9) between the logarithm of the dose and the peripheral blood neutrophil count in the treated mice. Using the same hG-CSF preparation, 38 experiments indicated that the regression lines are highly reproducible. Such an association never occurred with intact mice, and 100 mg/kg of CPA induced the highest response to hG-CSF. This linear relationship between the two variables allows us to determine the biologic potency of a test hG-CSF preparation relative to a reference standard using a parallel line assay, with a coefficient of precision of around .2. When assayed by this bioassay procedure, which we have termed CPA-mouse assay, natural hG-CSF and recombinant hG-CSF (produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells) were nearly equipotent in specific biologic activity. These results confirm the CPA-mouse assay as an especially useful assay method for quantifying the in vivo activity of hG-CSF.\r"

  ".W": "The in vivo effect of recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) on the resistance of mice to bacterial infection and on the number and function of neutrophils was studied in lethally irradiated mice transplanted with syngeneic bone marrow cells. Bone marrow transplanted (BMT) mice were injected intraperitoneally with 150 ng rGM-CSF or buffer solution (diluent) twice daily for 18 consecutive days. Total neutrophil recovery from the peripheral blood and the number of neutrophils mobilized into the peritoneal cavity were accelerated in rGM-CSF-treated recipients. Peritoneal neutrophils isolated from mice treated with rGM-CSF exhibited primed superoxide generation (O2-) after in vitro stimulation with suboptimal concentrations of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), as compared with control mice (treated with diluent). No additional increase in O2- production occurred upon in vitro incubation of these cells with rGM-CSF. The protective activity of rGM-CSF was examined in mice injected with Salmonella typhimurium. There was a 44- and 9-fold increase in the number of S typhimurium at 96 hours postinfection in the spleen and liver, respectively, of control mice, as compared with rGM-CSF-treated mice, after a single injection of the bacteria (3 X 10(7) per mouse). All the untreated control mice died within 14 days postinoculation (1 X 10(7) bacteria per mouse), whereas 35% of the mice treated with rGM-CSF remained alive for more than 30 days postinfection. These findings support the concept that increased granulopoiesis and enhanced functional activity of phagocytic cells is induced by rGM-CSF and is responsible for enhanced resistance of BMT mice to bacterial infection.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet factor 4 (PF4) is a 70 amino acid protein released from the alpha-granules of platelets after activation. The exact biologic function of this protein is unknown. We have constructed an expression vector for recombinant PF4 (rPF4) in the T7-based promoter vector pT7-7 to better study the relationship between PF4 structure and function. The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Purity of protein was confirmed by immunoblot analysis and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, which resulted in a single component with a molecular weight of 8,000 daltons. The amino acid composition and sequence of the N-terminal 20 residues showed that rPF4 is identical to PF4 prepared from human platelets (hPF4), except for an N-terminal initiating methionine residue. Immunoblots revealed that rPF4 and hPF4 bound polyclonal anti-hPF4 equally well, while chemotaxis experiments demonstrated similar potencies as neutrophil attractants. Dose-dependent neutrophil chemotactic responses and competitive studies with polyclonal anti-hPF4 antiserum further demonstrate similar chemotactic properties of the two PF4 species. In conclusion, our data show that this recombinant protein and the native protein appears to have similar immunologic, heparin-binding, and chemotactic properties. The chemotactic properties of hPF4 appear to be entirely intrinsic to the protein and not due, in part, to any contaminating protein. Furthermore, our expression vector should prove useful for the construction of recombinant forms of PF4 to investigate structure/function relationships of this biologically important protein.\r"

The normal gland consists of both periurethral muscle and glands. The periurethral muscle has little structure on microradiography and is therefore hypoechoic (low amplitude echoes) on ultrasound scanning. The gland itself, both central and peripheral zones, has a lattice appearance on microradiography (reticular structure) and therefore produces mid-range amplitude echoes on ultrasound. Benign hypertrophy develops at the edge of the periurethral muscle and is microadenomatous in structure. This produces mid-range amplitude echoes which are coarser than in the normal gland. Associated calcification has a characteristic distribution around the adenomas. Cancer produces an amorphous structure resulting in loss of ultrasonic echoes (hypoechoic). In a few cancers irregular calcification is present, resulting in high echoes in the ultrasound scan (hyperechoic) which are not in the typical benign distribution. The internal structure of the prostate was therefore demonstrated in its histopathological states by the technique of microradiography and seen to relate to its representation by ultrasound.\r"

Because of the slow pace of relapse compared with malignant teratoma, with relapses occurring after 2 years, a pilot study was initiated to evaluate the effect of 2 courses of adjuvant carboplatin. The results to date in 25 patients suggest that with the use of modern antiemetics this regimen is as well tolerated as prophylactic radiotherapy. With a median follow-up of 16 months there has been 1 relapse subsequently salvaged by combination chemotherapy. A radomised trial is now justified to assess the quality of life and late toxicity of this approach compared with prophylactic radiotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-six infants with prenatally diagnosed hydronephrosis are reported. In all instances the diagnosis was confirmed postnatally and at renography 45 were obstructed; 38 obstructed kidneys (84%) and all of the non-obstructed kidneys had a differential function exceeding 40% of total function. Latterly we have come to recommend early pyeloplasty only if differential function of a renographically obstructed kidney is less than 40%; 6 early pyeloplasties were performed for this reason; 28 infants (30 renal units) were managed non-operatively and 18 of these (19 renal units) were reassessed renographically. In 11 the obstruction persists. Sonography demonstrated improving hydronephrosis in 8 kidneys with resolution in 5 and no change in 6. Of the other 10 infants (11 renal units), the hydronephrosis has improved in 4, resolved in 1 and remains unchanged in 6. Our experience suggests that neonatal and early pyeloplasty can be restricted to a modest number of infants in whom there is impaired renal function. In cases with normal function the natural history appears essentially benign and does not justify routine pyeloplasty.\r"

In 1987, 5907 such procedures were carried out on 700 patients for more than 22 different diseases; this represented an increase of 28% over the figure for 1982. A shift in activity has occurred over the years; originally hematologic disorders accounted for most of the procedures; however, in 1987, 60% of the exchanges were done to treat neurologic disorders, mainly myasthenia gravis and acute and chronic Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several prospective randomized clinical trials have recently been completed by the CASG in the hope of determining the optimal application of plasma exchange. These studies, currently under review, include 168 patients with multiple sclerosis, 100 with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and 43 with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Reactions occur in 12% of cases; they are usually minor and are limited to circumoral paresthesia, mild hypertension or hypotension and hives.\r"

Patients with complete, partial, and minor response after initial chemotherapy were randomized into groups to receive either maintenance chemotherapy (four cycles) after radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone. The objective response rate was 24% after chemotherapy and 41% after combined chemoradiotherapy (complete response, 7.5%). The overall median survival was 9 months and the 2-year survival was 14%. Survival was identical with or without maintenance chemotherapy. The 2-year survival of patients with complete response was 75% compared with 9% for patients with partial or minor response. These results suggest that only the few patients (ten) who achieve complete response have a strong probability of survival. It is therefore essential to search for other therapeutic modalities that result in an increase of the complete response rate.\r"

Information from cancer epidemiologic studies coupled with that from basic research on cancer biology have combined to reveal several categories of agents with potential for clinical application, including natural and synthetic tumor suppressive retinoids and antioxidants. Chemopreventive agents may inhibit the development of cancer by limiting exposure to initiators or promoters through stimulation of inactivation or excretion mechanisms. Biological consequences of exposure to carcinogens may also be interfered with, e.g., by inhibiting the activation of proto-oncogenes or by antagonizing the effects of oncogene expression. Hundreds of compounds with chemopreventive efficacy in vitro have been isolated from foods and plant products. The testing and development of candidate chemopreventives proceeds through a series of preclinical efficacy screens, followed by controlled clinical trials.\r"

Immunoperoxidase preparation of frozen-sections and routinely processed paraffin section specimens revealed a highly restricted reactivity of these antibodies when tested with adult (n = 2) and fetal (n = 3) tissue types. Coreactivities were occasionally observed with epithelia of the kidney, mammary gland, and pancreas. One monoclonal antibody, Ki-OC I-6-2, cross-reacted only with epididymal epithelia. No coreaction occurred with normal tissue of the ovary, Fallopian tube, or uterus. All antibodies were additionally tested on 74 cases of nonovarian malignancies, 15 cases of ovarian metastases of nonovarian carcinomas, and 114 specimens of ovarian neoplasms other than carcinomas. Ki-OC I-6-2 had no cross-reactivity with these tumors except for one case of renal cell carcinoma. This monoclonal antibody recognized serous, mucinous, and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cell types. None of the six antibodies reacted with clear cell or endometrioid carcinoma. All were found to be of the IgG-1 subclass. The tumor antigen to which Ki-OC I-6-2 immunoreacted was estimated to have a molecular weight of 80 kilodaltons (KD).\r"

In the literature, most reported cases of 7q32-q36 abnormalities had T-cell type leukemia/lymphoma and were younger than 20 years. Two NHL cases, including the current case, were diagnosed as having lymphoblastic lymphoma with a leukemic transformation. The neoplastic cells of the reported cases commonly showed CD2 (E-rosette receptors) and CD38. All 17 patients but three manifested a mediastinal mass at diagnosis and seven had central nervous system lesions or pleural infiltration. Furthermore, five of the 19 reported cases also showed 9p- change.\r"

Amplification of c-myc was observed in the specimens from the endometrium (ten-fold) and from omental metastasis (five-fold). Both int-2 and c-erbB-2 amplification were not observed. The tumor showed aneuploidy, with the specimens from the endometrium and omental metastasis exhibiting multiple populations of aneuploid tumor cells. Estrogen and progesterone receptors could not be detected biochemically; however, immunohistochemically, estrogen receptors were observed in tumor cells forming papillary structures but not in the tumor cells of the solid, more poorly differentiated areas. A similar distribution was observed for both low and high molecular weight keratin. The findings of c-myc amplification and aneuploidy in the serous papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium are consistent with its aggressive behavior observed clinically and emphasize the importance of distinguishing this lesion from other types of endometrial carcinoma.\r"
