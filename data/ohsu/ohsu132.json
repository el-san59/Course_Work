ICA were detected in 2 subjects--in 1 after rubella and in the other after measles, but this patient had evidence of previous rubella and a strong autoimmune family history. ICA did not appear after mumps. It is postulated that viral infections may trigger the production of IgM-IAA by a common mechanism involving polyclonal immunocyte activation.\r"

The mean reduction in exacerbation rate of 34 patients who received IFN-B (recipients) was significantly greater during the study than that of 35 patients who received placebo (p less than 0.04). The prestudy exacerbation rates were comparable in recipients and controls, but the rate at the end of the study was significantly lower in recipients than in controls (p less than 0.001). IFN-B was given by nine or ten lumbar punctures over the first 6 months of the study, and patient observations continued for 2 years. IFN-B was well tolerated in 95% of the recipients, and the side-effects experienced were clearly acceptable for the benefits achieved. Low doses of indomethacin reduced the toxicity of IFN-B and played an important role in successful double-blinding.\r"

Several therapeutic modalities have been advocated for the prevention of recurrent episodes of acute otitis media (AOM). A blinded, prospective, randomized study was designed to determine the efficacy of tympanostomy tubes, antibiotic prophylaxis, and placebo. Children with recurrent AOM were entered in the study and followed for at least 6 months. A total of 65 children completed the protocol. Sixty-three of those were under the age of 4 years. Treatment failure was defined as two or more episodes of AOM or otorrhea in less than 3 months. Five of 22 children in the tympanostomy tube group failed, compared to 12 of 20 in the placebo group (p = .02). There were 8 or 21 treatment failures in the sulfisoxazole group. Children with otitis media with effusion (OME) at the time of their initial visit had significantly less middle ear disease when treated with tympanostomy tubes. Tympanostomy tube insertion for prophylaxis of recurrent acute otitis is supported by these findings. Improvement of recurrent AOM was observed in the sulfisoxazole group, but was not statistically significant.\r"

Run times ranged from 172 to 183 s on run 1 and 145 to 152 s for run 2. Leg power averaged 62 W for both tests. Oxygen uptake averaged 52 ml X kg-1 X min-1 under all conditions. Analysis of variance showed that there was no significant effect of acute or chronic ingestion of phosphate tablets beyond that of the placebo treatment on any of the performance tests. These results argue against the claim of ergogenic benefits ascribed to this nutritional supplement.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effects of acute exercise on renal prostaglandins E2 (PGE2) and F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) synthesis, urine collections were obtained from six women before and after 30 min of treadmill exercise at approximately 80% of their maximal oxygen consumption. After receiving a placebo for 3 days, with acute exercise, there was a significant increase only in recovery urine PGE2 concentration. Due to a decline in urine volume, PGF2 excretion was unchanged and PGF2 alpha excretion was significantly decreased by exercise. Subjects repeated the tests after 3 d of indomethacin treatment (150 mg X d-1), a known renal prostaglandin (PG) inhibitor, and 3 d of sulindac (300 mg X d-1), a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which may not inhibit renal PG synthesis. Pre-exercise urine PGE2 concentrations were decreased by indomethacin but not by sulindac, whereas, PGF2 alpha concentrations were decreased by both drugs. When compared to the control test, indomethacin and sulindac had different effects on pre-exercise urine/plasma osmolality ratios and free water clearances. Neither indomethacin nor sulindac influenced the decreases in free water clearances, which were observed during the placebo tests. Exercise proteinuria was significantly increased by indomethacin but not by sulindac. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that acute exercise may stimulate renal PGE2 synthesis. During exercise, renal PG synthesis attenuates protein excretion. There also appear to be differences between indomethacin and sulindac with regard to the effects on renal PG synthesis and kidney function.\r"

  ".W": "Although inflammatory diseases of most human secretory surfaces are difficult to investigate clinically, the secretory immune system of the human prostate may be studied relatively easily because prostatic fluid may be obtained from the gland by digital massage. We studied inflammatory conditions of the prostate to establish whether we could use the humoral immune response to differentiate these conditions. Using a sensitive solid-phase radioimmunoassay, we measured total IgA and IgG, and IgA and IgG antibodies to Enterobacteriaceae in the serum and prostatic fluid of men with and without prostatic inflammation. These studies show that levels of IgA and IgG in the prostatic fluid of men with bacterial prostatitis are higher than those in men without histories of urinary or prostatic infections. In men with bacterial prostatitis, prostatic antibodies to Enterobacteriaceae were elevated 12 to 18 months after curative treatment and indefinitely after ineffective treatment; anti-Enterobacteriaceal IgG levels returned to normal after infection only with cure. Total IgA and IgG in the prostatic fluid of men with nonbacterial prostatitis--men who have signs of prostatic inflammation without evidence of old or ongoing bacterial infection--are also higher than levels found in uninfected individuals. Although this finding supports an inflammatory etiology for the symptoms seen in nonbacterial prostatitis, no significant IgA or IgG Enterobacteriaceal antibody titers were detected in these patients. This excludes a remote Enterobacteriaceal infection as a cause of nonbacterial prostatitis. These observations confirm that the prostate gland is a distinct part of the male secretory immune system.\r"

Indeed, the anatomic sophistication laid out by Sunderland and reflected in the daily practice of electromyography might cause doubt as to the need for further inquiry into the problem of localization of disease within peripheral nervous system. There are, however, numerous problems in clinical practice that do not yield to the traditional root-plexus-nerve analysis of localization.\r"

There was significantly more improvement in ptosis and endurance of upward gaze after edrophonium than after placebo. Five minutes after injection, the mean difference (+/- SD) in the percentage of the iris that was uncovered was 39 +/- 5.47 (70 vs. 31 percent; P less than 0.01), and the mean difference in the number of seconds of upward gaze was 33.1 +/- 9.29 (39.7 vs. 6.6 seconds; P less than 0.01). The expiratory and inspiratory pressures, forced vital capacity, and ability to cough, speak, and swallow also improved after edrophonium. In both the patients who were studied electromyographically, pretreatment and postplacebo responses were typical of myasthenia gravis and became normal after edrophonium. We conclude that anticholinesterases are beneficial in the management of neurotoxic envenoming by Asian cobras (Naja naja), and we recommended a test of edrophonium in any patient with signs of neurotoxic envenoming after snakebite.\r"

Thirty patients had early disease (Stages 1 and 2), and 30 had advanced disease (Stages 3 and 4). Fifteen patients with early disease and 15 with advanced disease received colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily), and the remainder received placebo. Patients were studied about every two months; those remaining in the blind phase at two years underwent repeat liver biopsy and were then placed on open-label colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily). With a few exceptions, the results in patients with early disease were similar to those in patients with advanced disease; hence, data on patients in all stages were combined in the main analysis. During the two-year study period the colchicine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo-treated patients, had improvement in levels of serum albumin, serum bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, cholesterol, and aminotransferases. However, there was no such improvement in the severity of symptoms or physical findings; moreover, there was no significant difference in the histologic changes noted at liver biopsy in the two treatment groups. At four years after entry, the cumulative mortality from liver disease was 21 percent in patients given colchicine and 47 percent in those given placebo (P = 0.05). The only side effect of colchicine was diarrhea, noted in three patients. The consistent and significant improvement in a number of markers of liver disease and the apparent decreased mortality from liver disease suggest that colchicine may provide some long-term clinical benefit in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. However, the failure of colchicine to reduce hepatic inflammation and fibrosis leaves uncertain the effect of the drug on the longterm outcome of this disease.\r"

Within a six-month follow-up period, 15 of 21 women (71.4 percent) treated with placebo had symptomatic recurrence of candidal vaginitis. In contrast, candidal vaginitis recurred in 6 of 21 (28.6 percent) and in 1 of 21 (4.8 percent) women in Groups B and C (P less than 0.01; P less than 0.001). After the prophylaxis was discontinued, the recurrence rates of candidal vaginitis were high in women in Groups B and C. At the end of 12 months of follow-up, 23.8 percent of the women in Group A remained asymptomatic and attack-free, in contrast to 42.9 percent of the women in Group B (P greater than 0.05) and 52.4 percent in Group C (P less than 0.05). It appears that maintenance prophylactic therapy with oral ketoconazole is effective in preventing recurrent episodes of vulvovaginal candidiasis, but that relapse is common after withdrawal of the drug. Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, caution is essential in selecting patients for long-term ketoconazole therapy and in following patients undergoing such treatment.\r"

We randomly assigned 44 patients with this disease to receive 13-cis-retinoic acid (24 patients) or placebo (20), 1 to 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for three months, and followed them for six months. There were major decreases in the size of the lesions in 67 percent (16 patients) of those given the drug and in 10 percent (2 patients) of those given placebo (P = 0.0002); dysplasia was reversed in 54 percent (13 patients) of the drug group and in 10 percent (2 patients) of the placebo group (P = 0.01). The clinical response to the drug correlated with the histologic response in 56 percent (9 of 16) of the patients evaluated. Relapse occurred in 9 of 16 patients two to three months after treatment ended. The toxic effects of the drug were acceptable in all but two patients. Cheilitis, facial erythema, and dryness and peeling of the skin were common; conjunctivitis and hypertriglyceridemia also occurred. All adverse reactions could be reversed by reducing the dose or temporarily discontinuing the drug. We conclude that 13-cis-retinoic acid, even in short-term use, appears to be an effective treatment for oral leukoplakia and has an acceptable level of toxicity.\r"

The recombinant human erythropoietin was given intravenously three times weekly after dialysis, and transfusion requirements, hematocrit, ferrokinetics, and reticulocyte responses were monitored. Over a range of doses between 15 and 500 units per kilogram of body weight, dose-dependent increases in effective erythropoiesis were noted. At 500 units per kilogram, changes in the hematocrit of as much as 10 percentage points were seen within three weeks, and increases in ferrokinetics of three to four times basal values, as measured by erythron transferrin uptake, were observed. Of 18 patients receiving effective doses of recombinant human erythropoietin, 12 who had required transfusions no longer needed them, and in 11 the hematocrit increased to 35 percent or more. Along with the rise in hematocrit, four patients had an increase in blood pressure, and a majority had increases in serum creatinine and potassium levels. No organ dysfunction or other toxic effects were observed, and no antibodies to the recombinant hormone were formed. These results demonstrate that recombinant human erythropoietin is effective, can eliminate the need for transfusions with their risks of immunologic sensitization, infection, and iron overload, and can restore the hematocrit to normal in many patients with the anemia of end-stage renal disease.\r"

  ".W": "Several steps in the clinical evolution of human neoplasia are associated with a variety of recurrent chromosomal defects that could prove essential to the understanding of cancer. We found 15 types of nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in a study of 71 patients with follicular lymphoma; 10 of the types appeared to influence the histopathological findings, clinical course, or response to treatment. A translocation, t(14;18), observed in 85 percent of all patients appeared to be the main determinant of a follicular pattern. Ten patients with a t(14;18) as a single defect had the histologic features of follicular small cleaved-cell lymphoma. Most did not require treatment for one to four years, because their tumors had an initial indolent course. In contrast, patients with follicular small cleaved-cell lymphoma with t(14;18) and deletion 13q32 acquired the hematologic features of leukemia and had an acceleration of the disease. A deletion 6q together with a complete or partial trisomy 7 or trisomy 12 (or both) was associated with the clinically more aggressive follicular mixed small- and large-cell or large-cell histologic type, which often evolves from follicular small-cell lymphoma. A complete or partial trisomy 3, 18, or 21 correlated almost exclusively with follicular large-cell lymphoma. In all follicular stages, a trisomy 2 or duplication 2p often accompanied an accelerated clinical course and a poor response to treatment. This study suggests that several discrete genomic defects may govern the evolution of a patient's malignant disease.\r"

  ".W": "The activity of many proteins in eukaryotic cells is regulated by reversible covalent phosphorylation. This regulatory modification is often linked to other allosteric controls within the same protein, and such overlapping regulatory mechanisms are best characterized for glycogen phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1). Phosphorylases from different organisms or cell types exhibit markedly contrasting regulatory features; this makes the enzyme attractive for studying the evolution of interacting molecular regulatory mechanisms. Extensive biochemical and crystallographic studies of rabbit muscle phosphorylase have led to a characterization of five regulatory regions (phosphorylation, glycogen storage, AMP, glucose and purine sites). Here we report the complete primary structure of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae glycogen phosphorylase, deduced from the sequence of the cloned gene. Regions that are highly conserved between muscle and yeast enzymes include the active site, the glycogen storage site and possibly the glucose and purine inhibition sites. Partial conservation of the residues involved in AMP-binding suggests a binding site for the yeast enzyme inhibitor, glucose 6-phosphate. Other parts of the AMP site and the intersubunit contacts involved in AMP allostery are disrupted in the yeast enzyme by extreme sequence divergence. The poor alignment of amino termini and lack of homology at phosphorylation sites indicate that regulation by reversible phosphorylation evolved independently in yeast and vertebrate phosphorylases.\r"

In red blood cell ghosts that contain no ATP the receptor on the extracellular surface remains in place and parasites will bind to the membrane, but will not enter. ATP is thus necessary for one of the steps in the invasion sequence that follows recognition and attachment. The process of entry appears to involve the active participation of the host cell membrane cytoskeleton. We have suggested that the function of the intracellular ATP may be to regulate phosphorylation of the cytoskeleton. We now present evidence that the activity of the membrane-associated cyclic AMP-independent kinase of the red blood cell is inseparable from invasion; the active substrate may be spectrin.\r"

  ".U": "87065122\r", 
  ".W": "The neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) has been implicated in morphogenetic events during formation of the nervous system. Three forms of N-CAM exist, all glycoprotein chains, of relative molecular masses 180,000 (180K), 140K and 120K (N-CAM180, N-CAM140 and N-CAM120) which are differentially expressed on neural cell types and during development. The three chains are thought to carry similar if not identical amino-acid sequences on their extracellular amino-terminal domains, but differ in the length of their carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic region. They occur in highly sialylated embryonic and less sialylated adult forms. N-CAM180 is selectively expressed in more differentiated neural cells and may play a role in the stabilization of cell contacts. To investigate this, we have studied in the surface membrane of a mouse neuroblastoma cell line N2A the lateral mobility of the two predominant forms of N-CAM, N-CAM180 and N-CAM140, as a function of differentiation. Here we report that as judged by fringe pattern photobleaching, the surface mobility of N-CAM140 is higher than that of N-CAM180, suggesting an association of N-CAM180 with the cytoskeleton or other stabilizing factors. We also show that brain spectrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein, binds only to N-CAM180. The immobilization of N-CAM in differentiated N2A cells is achieved by a shift in expression from N-CAM140 to N-CAM180.\r"

We recently performed a similar search in porcine pancreas and found a high concentration of a peptide having a glycine amide at its C-terminus. Here we report the isolation, primary structure and biological activity of this novel peptide. The 49-residue peptide strongly inhibits glucose-induced insulin release from the isolated perfused pancreas and was therefore named pancreastatin. It may be important in the regulation of insulin secretion and in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes mellitus.\r"

The presence of P-glycoprotein in human cancers refractory to chemotherapy suggests that tumour cells with multidrug resistance can arise during malignant progression. We have discovered striking homology between P-glycoprotein and the HlyB protein, a 66K Escherichia coli membrane protein required for the export of haemolysin (protein of Mr 107K). P-glycoprotein can be viewed as a tandem duplication of the HlyB protein. The hydropathy profiles of the two proteins are similar and reveal an extensive transmembrane region resembling those found in pore-forming plasma membrane proteins. The C-terminal region of P-glycoprotein and the HlyB protein contain sequences homologous to the nucleotide-binding domains of a group of closely related bacterial ATP-binding proteins. We propose a model for multidrug resistance in which P-glycoprotein functions as an energy-dependent export pump to reduce intracellular levels of anticancer drugs.\r"

A group of patients with neglected extremities was compared with a group of patients in which thalamotomy did not produce neglect. Neglect was shown by changes in motor performance, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and electroencephalographic frequency induced by the lesion, as well as radiological evidence of brain atrophy and place and extension of lesions. Reaction time to both auditory and somatosensory stimuli was significantly increased only in the extremities contralateral to the lesion of patients with neglect; tremor decreased equally in both groups, and other motor abilities remained unchanged. P-200 component of SEP decreased in amplitude and increased in latency only in cases with neglect, particularly ipsilateral to the lesion; early components and mean electroencephalographic frequency remained unchanged. Brain atrophy was significant in patients with neglect, particularly for the posterior portion of the 3rd ventricle. No differences in size and location of the lesions were found between the groups. Results indicate that this type of neglect is not secondary to lesions in specific sensory of motor pathways, but to lesions of structures coupling sensorimotor functions and the process of attention and that midline thalamic nuclei atrophy precipitates the neglect, perhaps by critically decreasing the amount of reticulothalamocortical projections engaged in selective attention.\r"

High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) is a little-known clinical entity that manifests itself by a perplexing array of both generalized and localized neurological symptoms and signs. Furthermore, the development of HACE in climbers offers a unique experimental situation in which to examine the effects of hypoxia on the central nervous system.

The 24K protein, originally discovered in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line, was studied in 51 cases by the modified immunoperoxidase Avidin-Biotin Complex method, using an anti-24K mouse monoclonal antibody. Immunostained sections were compared to hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained sections cut from the same tissue block. The 24K protein was observed to be located primarily in the parabasal or \"prickle cell layer\" of normal cervical tissue (6 of 7 normal cervical tissue specimens tested were positive for 24K protein. Specimens were obtained from surgery for nonneoplastic causes) and in all cases (12 of 12) of dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. Intercellular bridges of these cells showed prominent immunostaining in normal cervix and dysplasia. 24K protein was observed as a granular cytoplasmic stain in all cases of squamous metaplasia (5 of 5) and keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (9 of 9), and in 8 of 14 cases of nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. In this latter group, immunostaining was confined to only those cells showing cytoplasmic eosinophilia on H&E sections. In no case was the presence of the 24K protein associated with areas of mature keratin. 24K immunostaining was also observed in the reserve cells of morphologically normal endocervical glands adjacent to areas of dysplasia and carcinoma. We conclude that 24K protein is associated with squamous cell maturation and may be an important marker of reserve cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia.\r"

Thirty-four (20%) of those evaluated underwent laparoscopy, of whom 31 (91%) were found to have ectopic pregnancies. Only three of the ectopic pregnancies were ruptured; only two women had significant hemoperitoneum and only two required transfusion. Subsequent intrauterine pregnancy occurred in 5 of 11 patients who underwent salpingectomy (45%) and in 1 of 15 patients who underwent salpingotomy (7%). There were no subsequent pregnancies in five patients after expression of the ectopic from the tube. Early intervention in an infertile population decreases morbidity and may favor conservative tubal surgery, although our series could not confirm the benefits of such surgery.\r"

Endothelial rejection-free transplant survival in this group was compared to a retrospective historical control group of 199 consecutive transplants performed in recipients selected on the basis of age and longest wait criteria. The two groups were comparable with regards to primary diagnosis, preoperative corneal vascularization, donor and recipient age, and operative techniques. Thirty-eight transplants in the study group and 28 transplants in the control group were at high risk for endothelial transplant rejection. At 12 months, the estimated rejection-free survival (Kaplan-Meier method) of the high-risk study group transplants was 87% compared to 74% for the high-risk historical control group and transplants. This difference did not reach the significant level of 0.05 with the log-rank test. The 12-month estimated rejection-free survival of low-risk study group and historical control group transplants were similar. In the study group, the 12-month estimated rejection-free survival of well-matched transplants was 95% compared to 83% for poorly matched transplants (log rank, P less than 0.02). These findings suggest that a relationship exists between HLA-A,B and DR compatibility of donor and recipient and the corneal rejection-free transplant survival.\r"

After CALP, there was marked regression of the neovascularization with reversal of graft rejection in all eyes. Three additional patients with vascularized corneas, referred for penetrating keratoplasty, underwent CALP preoperatively with obliteration of the vessels (group 2). Two of these patients have since undergone keratoplasty and, in both, the grafts have remained avascular and clear over a 21-month follow-up. Two other patients with corneal injury and progressive corneal opacification and vascularization have also been treated with CALP (group 3). CALP may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of corneal neovascularization. Further clinical studies are needed to define its exact role.\r"

The peroxidase stain was positive at high dilutions of the antibody in the epithelium of normal mucosa, and the titers were significantly higher than those within benign lesions (p less than 0.001) and carcinomas (p less than 0.001). However, the titers in the benign lesions varied considerably, with two specimens recorded as negative. In contrast, the reaction for the H antigen was negative in 19 specimens (66%) of the malignant lesions and the endpoint titers of the H positive carcinomas indicated marked loss of the antigen. This loss was significant when compared to the benign lesions (p less than 0.001). The results show that the loss of the H antigen on malignant epithelial cells may be a valuable marker for primary squamous cell carcinoma.\r"

The studies done to date suggest a high degree of short-term efficacy of biofeedback, which has been maintained on long-term follow-ups. While comparisons of biofeedback with relaxation generally have shown approximately equivalent effectiveness, the two forms of therapy may be differentially effective with different subjects. Attempts to correlate EMG and/or thermal parameters with headache parameters generally have failed to produce significant results, particularly in more recent and better-controlled studies; however, numerous technical and procedural difficulties have obscured meaningful interpretation of physiological data. Results with pseudofeedback do suggest a likely specific contribution of frontalis EMG to muscle contraction headaches, at least for some subjects. Comparable evidence for a specific contribution of thermal parameters to migraines is almost totally lacking. Clinical outcome research suggests that biofeedback in general may be more effective in younger anxious subjects who show no chronic habituation to drugs, and that there is little apparent benefit from repeating biofeedback for more than about 12 sessions maximum. Three broad areas for subsequent research are suggested: longitudinal study of EMG and thermal parameters in a naturalistic setting, specification of processes critically involved in biofeedback, and clinically relevant comparative outcome research with biofeedback and alternative therapies.\r"

  ".U": "87066597\r", 
  ".W": "Controversy exists concerning the degree of importance of periventricular intraparenchymal echodensities (IPE) observed on neonatal ultrasound scans in the determination of subsequent neurologic disability in premature infants. In this report, IPE was studied in 75 infants weighing less than 2,000 g at birth to determine the basic characteristics of the lesion, the likely pathogenesis, the outcome, and the aspects of the ultrasonographic appearance in the acute period of neonatal illness that are important for prediction of outcome. IPE was defined as any periventricular echodensity greater than 1 cm in at least one dimension. IPE was strikingly associated with large areas of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (81% of cases). IPE was distinctly asymmetric. Thus, the lesion was either exclusively unilateral (67%) or bilateral with marked predominance on one side. The associated IVH was asymmetric in approximately 80% of cases, and in all 50 cases of large asymmetric IVH, IPE occurred on the same side as the larger amount of intraventricular blood. Moreover, more than 50% of such cases of IPE associated with large asymmetric IVH were progressive. Neuropathologic correlation showed that IPE represented hemorrhagic necrosis of periventricular tissue. Concerning pathogenesis, these data raise the possibility that large asymmetric IVH is related etiologically to IPE. Outcome varied with the severity of the IPE. Thus, the mortality rate among the 38 infants with extensive IPE was 79%. Of the survivors with extensive IPE, all had subsequent major motor deficits and all but one exhibited cognitive function less than 80% of normal. Among the 37 infants with localized IPE, the mortality rate was 38%. Of the survivors, although 79% had major motor deficits, 43% had cognitive function greater than 80% of normal. Thus, the findings demonstrate that with extensive IPE there is little or no chance for survival with normal neurologic and cognitive outcome, but with localized IPE, although major motor deficits are common, an appreciable proportion of infants have cognitive function in the normal range. Careful, quantitative assessment of the ultrasonographic features of IPE in the acute period of illness in the premature infant is of major value in estimating outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Although there has been concern that a variety of nursing care procedures may serve as potent adaptive demands in patients with intracranial hypertension, research shows that activities such as bathing, oral hygiene, touching, and suctioning produce relatively small increases in ICP and are accompanied by adequate CPP. Head rotation and flexion are potent stimuli to increased ICP, although CPP has remained adequate in the small number of people in whom it has been measured. While considerable descriptive work has been done with respect to a variety of nursing care activities, much remains to be done. Little is known about the mechanisms by which activities (turning and suctioning) effect demands upon the craniospinal system, nor what the best predictors are of individuals who will respond adversely to such demands. The potential of affective touch and environmental sensory stimulation to reduce ICP and reduce the need for potent pharmacologic agents is intriguing but has not been adequately explored. Further investigators need to attend to reporting individual as well as group patterns to guide clinical application and describe predictors of individual response. In addition, the oscillatory nature of ICP and cardiovascular variables needs to be taken into account in interpreting whether or not \"real\" change has occurred in response to given activities. The full range of cerebrovascular variables needs to be measured to determine if changes in ICP pose a threat to cerebral perfusion. Finally, we need to examine nursing therapeutics with respect to ultimate outcomes (functional recovery) as well as to individual care activities.\r"

  ".U": "87067420\r", 
  ".W": "Plasmids carrying cloned segments of the frd operon of Escherichia coli have been used in genetic complementation studies to identify two independent mutants defective in the frdD gene, which encodes the hydrophobic FrdD polypeptide of the fumarate reductase complex. Mutations in the frdA and frdB genes have also been mapped by this technique. One of the FrdD peptide mutants, DW109 (frdD-109), showed that fumarate reductase was not as tightly bound to the membrane in this mutant. In addition, the mutation in the FrdD peptide caused an almost total loss of the ability of the enzyme to oxidize either menaquinol-6, a physiological donor for fumarate reduction, or reduced benzyl viologen. However, the mutation did not impair the ability of the membrane-bound fumarate reductase complex to function with succinate as substrate, as evidenced by unchanged turnover numbers for phenazine methosulfate and 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-pentyl-1,4-benzoquinone (a quinone analogue) reductase activities. These data establish the essential role of the FrdD polypeptide both in the interaction of the enzyme with reduced menaquinone and thus in anaerobic respiration with fumarate as electron acceptor, and in binding the enzyme to the membrane.\r"

  ".W": "Recombinant Escherichia coli-derived human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces the 1.3-kilobase beta 2 interferon (IFN-beta 2) mRNA in human diploid fibroblasts (FS-4 strain). IFN-beta 2 is serologically related to the well-characterized IFN-beta 1 (respective antisera cross-neutralize the heterologous protein). Polyclonal and monoclonal anti-IFN-beta antibodies inhibit the increase in class I HLA gene expression (HLA-B7 mRNA) in TNF-treated FS-4 cells suggesting that TNF-induced IFN-beta 2 mediates the enhancing effect of TNF on HLA gene expression in human fibroblasts. The structure of this autocrine human interferon has been determined. A cDNA library was prepared from polyadenylylated RNA extracted from TNF-induced FS-4 cells, and eight IFN-beta 2 cDNA clones were isolated using a 21-nucleotide synthetic oligonucleotide probe. The 1128-nucleotide sequence of IFN-beta 2 mRNA and the 212-amino acid sequence of the IFN-beta 2 protein were deduced from these cDNA clones. The amino acid sequences of the serologically related human IFN-beta 1 and -beta 2 were compared using the Sellers TT metric algorithm for locating similarities and using the pattern scoring method for evaluating the observed similarities. IFN-beta 1 and -beta 2 each contain a segment that is approximately 100 amino acids including 39 amino acids that are aligned and identical in the two proteins. The hydropathic index plots across these segments in the two proteins are also strikingly similar. The region of similarity between IFN-beta 1 and -beta 2 includes a section that is also highly conserved in all IFN-alpha species sequenced. Thus IFN-beta 2 shares structural similarities with other human interferons that also preferentially increase class I HLA gene expression.\r"

When exposed to small steps delivered iontophoretically, they fail to adapt over periods of up to 12 sec; when exposed to longer steps in a flow cell, they partially adapt, but with a decay time of greater than 30 sec. cheZ mutants use a weighting that extends at least 40 sec into the past. The gain of the chemotactic system is large: the change in occupancy of one receptor molecule produces a significant response.\r"

RNA gel blot analysis showed that the corresponding mRNA was approximately equal to 5900 nucleotides in size and present in the uterus, where its concentration was increased by estrogen treatment, and in the vagina. This mRNA was not detected in liver, in spleen, in intestine, and in kidney where the receptor protein is known to be absent or present in very small concentration. Cross-hybridizing clones were isolated from a lambda 10 library. The DNA was sequenced, and the primary structure of the progesterone receptor was deduced. It consists of 930 amino acids and contains a basic, cysteine-rich region (residues 568-645) with extensive homology to the glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors and the v-erbA oncogene protein. This region is followed by a C-terminal domain that is similar in size to the corresponding domains of the other steroid receptors and v-erbA and shows striking amino acid homology with the glucocorticoid receptor and significant homology with the estrogen receptor. In contrast, the region extending from the cysteine-rich segment toward the N terminus differed in size and amino acid sequence from that of the other receptors and v-erbA. This region had a high proline content in the progesterone receptor.\r"

An important factor contributing to the efficiency of this process is the rigorous selection, before blastocyst injection, of genetically transformed cells for in vitro developmental pluripotency. One of the advantages of the ES cell route to transgenesis is that it provides investigators with the opportunity to screen for the desired genetic alterations before reintroducing the ES cells into the animal.\r"

Fractionation data indicated that this amount of CPY primary sequence is sufficient to quantitatively divert invertase to the yeast vacuole. The phenotypic consequence of localizing active invertase to the vacuole has enabled us to select for mutants that \"mislocalize\" the hybrid protein to the cell surface. The corresponding mutations that lead to this effect are all trans-acting and recessive, and they define at least eight complementation groups. These vacuolar protein targeting (vpt) mutants also exhibit hybrid protein independent defects in wild-type CPY delivery to the yeast vacuole. Precursor forms of CPY accumulate in the mutants and are secreted into the yeast periplasm and extracellular medium. The vpt mutants should provide useful information pertaining to the mechanisms by which yeast cells regulate vacuolar protein traffic.\r"

The present investigation was undertaken to determine its mechanism of action. Uromodulin was found to be a potent inhibitor of interleukin 1 (IL-1)-induced thymocyte proliferation. Uromodulin was compared to a previously described 30- to 35-kDa IL-1 inhibitor isolated from urine of febrile patients (febrile inhibitor). Uromodulin and the febrile inhibitor blocked the effects of both human IL-1 and recombinant murine IL-1, but the activity of uromodulin was greater than that of the only partially purified febrile inhibitor preparation. However, in contrast to the febrile inhibitor, uromodulin markedly enhanced interleukin 2-induced thymocyte proliferation. Antigenic analysis of the two preparations by ELISA and immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the febrile inhibitor did not cross-react with uromodulin using monoclonal or polyclonal antisera. These findings indicate that uromodulin is a potent IL-1 inhibitor that is probably distinct from the IL-1 inhibitor derived from the urine of febrile individuals. Whether this IL-1 inhibitory activity underlies its immunosuppressive activity on human lymphocytes remains to be established.\r"

We have prepared an antiserum against the 22-kDa integral membrane protein characteristic of rat liver peroxisomes. The antiserum crossreacts with the human liver counterpart, which likewise has a mass of 22 kDa. By immunoblot analysis, we demonstrate that the 22-kDa protein is present in normal amount in Zellweger liver and is integral to a membrane. The result suggests that peroxisome membranes are assembled in Zellweger syndrome but may be defective for the import of matrix proteins. As a result, newly synthesized proteins are left in the cytosol, where some persist and others are degraded. Lacking their usual content, such aberrant peroxisomal membranes would be unrecognizable morphologically. Immunoblot analyses also showed that the peroxisomal hydratase-dehydrogenase is deficient in Zellweger kidney as well as liver, but catalase is present in both organs.\r"

Scatchard and Hill analysis revealed a single population of noninteracting high-affinity binding sites (Kd, 0.33 nM; Bmax, 14.4 fmol per dish). Competition studies made with tachykinins and substance P analogues indicated that the characteristics of the 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter labeled substance P binding sites on glial cells were identical to those on rat brain synaptosomes. 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter labeled substance P binding sites were visualized by autoradiography, and differences in the intensity of labeling were seen among astrocytes.

Two hours of insulin hypoglycemia, which produced intense reflex stimulation of the splanchnic nerves as evidenced by a 55% decrease in the adrenal medulla catecholamine levels, resulted in a 3-fold increase in proenkephalin A mRNA levels in this tissue. The proenkephalin A mRNA levels reached a maximum 15-fold increase over control values 24 hr after this period of hypoglycemic stress and then gradually declined with an approximate half-life of 4 days. Native and cryptic [Met5]enkephalin-like IR had increased 9-fold and 12-fold, respectively, 24 hr after this period of hypoglycemia, and both demonstrated maximum increases of 130-fold and 50-fold, respectively, after 96 hr. Combined pretreatment (i.p. administration) with the ganglionic and muscarinic blocking agents chlorisondamine (5 mg/kg of body weight) and atropine (1 mg/kg) blocked the increase in levels of proenkephalin A mRNA seen in the rat adrenal medulla following insulin hypoglycemia. These data indicate that reflex splanchnic nerve discharge stimulates proenkephalin biosynthesis, probably at the level of gene expression.\r"

Good surgical technique and good surgical judgment were felt to be important factors both in preventing postoperative fistula and in the success of their repair. Conventional methods of surgical repair of hard palate fistulas were seen to result in a very poor success rate. Orthodontic movement of maxillary segments was seen to contribute to late postoperative fistula formation. Therefore, orthodontic movement should be completed before undertaking surgical repair of anterior palatal fistulas. Finally, the success rate of anterior fistula repair has been dramatically improved by the addition of free periosteal grafts and cancellous bone grafts.\r"

Calcification was observed on CT images of one patient. Diagnostic aspiration revealed tan to yellow fluid containing many lymphocytes; pathognomonic fat globules were observed in four cases. Malignant cells were found in two collections, an unusual occurrence. Therapeutic needle aspiration and short-term catheter drainage were usually unsuccessful (only one of five patients [20%] was cured). Long-term (1-5-week) catheter drainage cured 11 of 14 patients (78.6%). Sclerosing agents may have been beneficial for lymphocele obliteration in three of four patients. For most patients, lymphoceles may be diagnosed and treated successfully using radiologic means.\r"

  ".W": "Sagittal sonograms through the caudothalamic groove routinely display a gangliothalamic ovoid delimited by the lateral ventricle, the perimesencephalic cistern, and the radiations of the corpus callosum. The caudothalamic groove divides the superior surface of the ovoid into an anterior caudate arc and a posterior thalamic arc. The cerebral peduncle divides the inferior surface of the ovoid into an anterior ganglial arc, a middle peduncular arc, and a posterior thalamic arc. The genu of internal capsule constantly courses from the anterior end of the caudothalamic groove down to the peduncular arc and is easily identified. The gangliothalamic ovoid exhibits four obliquely oriented bands of increased and decreased echogenicity. The anteriormost hyperechoic band 1 corresponds to the head of the caudate nucleus. Hypoechoic band 2 corresponds to the globus pallidus, genu of the internal capsule, and cerebral peduncle. Hyperechoic band 3 corresponds to the ventral and lateral thalamic nuclei (exclusive of the pulvinar). Hypoechoic band 4 corresponds to the pulvinar. Lesions of the medial nucleus of the globus pallidus appear as hyperechoic foci that abut on the anterior surface of genu just above the peduncle and that have a narrow convex caudal margin. Lesions of the lateral nucleus of globus pallidus abut on the genu distant from the peduncle, spare the medial nucleus adjacent to the peduncle, and have a broad caudal border. Lesions of the head of caudate nucleus affect the anterior pole of the ovoid; those of the body affect the caudate arc superior to the caudothalamic groove. Thalamic lesions increase the echogenicity of bands 3 and 4.\r"

Twenty-five patients with single vessel disease showed essentially no change in left ventricular EF with exercise (a decrease from 66% to 64%), but those with multivessel disease (21 patients) had a significant decrease in left ventricular EF (from 59% to 48%) (P = .0001). A decrease in left ventricular EF had a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 60% for the detection of multivessel disease, whereas an increase in wall-motion abnormality had a sensitivity and specificity of 72% and 71%, respectively. After myocardial infarction, a fall in left ventricular EF with stress intravenous DSA is highly sensitive for the detection of multivessel disease, but there are a number of false-positive results, resulting in only moderate specificity. A new wall motion abnormality has only a moderate sensitivity and specificity.\r"

This was consistent with the findings at surgery in four patients and with the results of barium studies in seven patients. In nine of 14 patients, stool cultures were performed, eight of which were positive for Yersinia enterocolitica. None of these 14 patients finally proved to have appendicitis. In a patient with acute pain in the right lower quadrant whose appendix cannot be visualized sonographically and whose US findings consist of enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and mural thickening of the terminal ileum, the diagnosis is probably mesenteric adenitis and acute terminal ileitis. Appendectomy should be avoided in this condition.\r"

Patients have a normal female karyotype and normal secondary sexual development. Previously, one had to rely on radiographic contrast studies and surgical exploration for accurate definition of the reproductive tract anatomy. The authors performed ultrasound (US) examinations on 12 patients, aged 5 days to 18 years, with the Mayer-Rokitansky syndrome. US allowed correct identification of the genitourinary anomalies found in these girls, including eight cases of unilateral renal agenesis; one absent, one rudimentary, and ten duplicated or obstructed uteri; eight duplicated or obstructed vaginas; and associated complications such as endometriosis. Eight of the patients had lower abdominal pain, often cyclical in nature. The findings demonstrate that high-resolution, real-time US in conjunction with water vaginography permits the anatomy of these complex anomalies to be defined.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) scans of the brain demonstrated the following characteristic abnormalities: reduction in quantity of periventricular white matter, particularly at the trigone, deep and prominent sulci that abutted the ventricles without interposed white matter, and ventriculomegaly with irregular outline of the lateral ventricles. The location and severity of abnormalities on CT scans correlated well with the neurologic abnormalities observed at follow-up and the known anatomic location of periventricular leukomalacia. These observations demonstrate the diagnostic value of CT scanning for periventricular leukomalacia during late infancy and childhood. Although serial ultrasonography during the first weeks of life may be diagnostic of periventricular leukomalacia, it is of less value later. In contrast, CT scans obtained beyond 6 months of age can demonstrate a characteristic pattern of abnormalities that may be considered diagnostic of periventricular leukomalacia.\r"

Accurate determination of the extent of disease is important because surgery is required for initial treatment and recurrence. High-resolution (10-MHz) ultrasonography (US) of the neck was used to study 15 patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma; nine of the 15 had undergone thyroidectomy but had biochemical evidence of tumor recurrence. Metastatic cervical lymph nodes were detected with US in all 12 patients who had metastatic nodes at surgery, although these nodes were palpable in only four. Punctate bright echogenic foci were seen within some of the nodes in nine of the 12 patients (75%). Similar bright echogenic foci were seen within the primary intrathyroid tumor in five of the six patients who had not yet undergone thyroidectomy (83%). Pathologically, these foci correlated with deposits of calcium surrounded by amyloid, which is characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma. US is useful for the detection of nonpalpable recurrence of cervical metastatic lymph nodes, and because it is noninvasive and relatively inexpensive, it should be the first imaging investigation performed after thyroidectomy.\r"

Vascular occlusion on the basis of severe vascular rejection was documented in ten patients (11.4%) for a sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Seven patients, for whom there was clinical and Doppler US evidence for renal artery stenosis, underwent angiography. A significant stenosis was confirmed and treated by angioplasty in four patients; one had an insignificant stenosis in an accessory artery, one had kinking of the renal vessels, and another had normal findings. The most reliable criteria for stenosis were a high-velocity jet exceeding 7.5 kHz and distal turbulence. One arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by the presence of an intrarenal high-velocity jet. Duplex Doppler US is a useful, noninvasive, and portable initial procedure with which to screen patients for vascular complications of renal transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Quantitative duplex Doppler sonography was performed in 55 renal transplant patients during 54 independent episodes of acute rejection, three episodes of chronic rejection, three episodes of acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and 23 occasions of normal graft function. Doppler signals were obtained from four arterial sites in each kidney. Nine patients, in whom signals were absent, were subsequently shown at nephrectomy to have absence of perfusion resulting from severe acute vascular rejection. In each patient with graft dysfunction, biopsy or nephrectomy was performed within 24 hours of the Doppler study. Arterial Doppler signals were quantified using a pulsatility index (PI). Acute rejection produced a significantly higher PI at each arterial site. Receiver-operator characteristics suggest that signals obtained from the segmental arteries are most sensitive to these changes. With a threshold PI of 1.5, the sensitivity of this technique for detection of acute renal allograft rejection is 75%; the specificity is 90%. In acute vascular rejection, the same PI yields a sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 90%. With a cutoff PI of 1.8, a specificity of 100% can be achieved.\r"

Hepatic arterial resistive indexes were correlated with corrected sinusoidal pressures. The results of duplex US agreed with those of angiography in 16 patients with a normal portal vein (including three with hepatofugal flow) and two with total thrombosis. One angiographically normal portal vein appeared thrombosed on an initial sonogram, but a second scan was normal. One case of partial thrombosis was not diagnosed with duplex US. Sensitivity and specificity for main portal vein disorders were 83% and 93%, respectively. Two patients had portal vein branch occlusions that were found by angiography but not by US. Portal vein echogenicity was neither sensitive nor specific for thrombosis. The resistive index of the hepatic artery was specific for portal hypertension when above .78, but it was not sensitive. Duplex US is accurate in prospectively assessing the direction of flow and the presence of total thrombosis in the portal vein, but partial thrombosis may not be detected on sonograms.\r"

At appropriate gain settings and time gain compensation, the liver parenchyma demonstrated diffuse increased echogenicity except for a solitary hypoechoic area with relatively distinct margins, usually located in the medial segment of the left hepatic lobe. This hypoechoic periportal focus varied in size between 1.5 and 5 cm and was typically ovoid, but was occasionally spherical or irregular in shape. Eight patients with such foci underwent percutaneous needle biopsy because of concern that there was a space-occupying mass. Microscopic examination of specimens from the hypoechoic periportal region revealed normal hepatic parenchymal cells, while tissue samples from the surrounding liver had high fat levels. In the remaining 23 patients, correlative radiologic studies supported the diagnosis of fatty liver and excluded a central-mass lesion. A localized area of normal hepatic tissue should be considered among the possible diagnoses when a circumscribed hypoechoic periportal area is demonstrated within a fatty liver.\r"

The method was applied to the livers of 18 healthy volunteers and 76 patients with liver disease, including 29 patients with chronic hepatitis and 30 patients with Gaucher disease. Patients with chronic hepatitis formed a bimodal distribution, with one group having lower than normal attenuation and echogenicity values and another having elevated values. Six patients with type I glycogen storage disease and fatty infiltration of the liver had highly attenuating, echogenic livers as did patients with fatty livers from other causes. This finding confirms the subjective impressions already reported in the literature. In contrast to previous literature reports, patients with cirrhosis had normal attenuation and echogenicity values. Reasons for this discrepancy are discussed.\r"

The primary neoplasms were renal cell carcinoma (13 cases), adrenal tumors (two cases), retroperitoneal tumors (two cases), and hepatic tumors (two cases). A positive diagnosis of tumor thrombus was achieved by both methods. The cranial extent of the tumor thrombus was better demonstrated by US studies, which showed echogenic endoluminal material within an enlarged IVC with a bulging anterior wall. On CT scans the tumor thrombus usually appeared as an endoluminal filling defect surrounded by a rim of contrast material. Tumor thrombus was better outlined by CT, particularly when it extended beyond the limits of the IVC wall, as in the retroperitoneal tumors. Neither method could accurately be used to predict IVC wall infiltration when the tumor thrombus remained within the confines of the IVC, nor could either method differentiate tumor from nontumor thrombi. US and CT are complementary in the preoperative assessment of tumor thrombus, and their use obviates the need for venacavography in many cases.\r"

There was no difference in nephrogram quality between contrast agents. Patients receiving Hexabrix had less of an increase in heart rate and demonstrated a slight rise in mean arterial blood pressure, rather than the biphasic rise then fall seen with Renografin-60. There was no significant change for up to 96 hours after urography in results of hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis, except for an increase of 0.005 in urine specific gravity with Renografin-60.

These findings, particularly the diffusely hyperechoic pattern, are explained on the basis of the action of the drugs. Twenty-one patients underwent surgery at the end of treatment.

Stable cryptic plasmids have also served to relate outbreak strains, particularly nonfermenting strains of gram-negative bacteria. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens have been the major plasmid-containing species in outbreaks involving single or multiple species. Outbreaks of single species with common plasmid patterns have included the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Ewingella americana, and Legionella pneumophila. Intrageneric spread of the same or similar R plasmids has nearly always occurred within the Enterobacteriaceae in large medical centers or Veterans Administration hospitals. High-risk nurseries and burn units have been conspicuous foci for R plasmid evolution. Hospital epidemiologists and clinical microbiologists will likely have an ever-increasing need to determine the plasmid content of gram-negative bacilli producing endemic and epidemic nosocomial infections.\r"

  ".W": "Late lesions of yaws are thought to be limited to skin, bones and joints, without congenital, visceral, or central nervous system (CNS) involvement. However, the treponemes isolated from patients with yaws, endemic syphilis, and venereal syphilis are genetically identical subspecies of Treponema pallidum. The controversy surrounding distinctions between syphilis and yaws is presented in its historical context, and reports of congenital, visceral, and CNS complications of yaws are reviewed. Isolation of treponemes from aqueous humor, as well as CSF abnormalities in 24.9% of 902 patients with yaws, indicate the existence of CNS involvement. The high prevalence of tropical myeloneuropathies of unknown origin discovered in areas of previous treponemal endemicity, particularly in Jamaica and Colombia, may represent late complications of yaws. Careful analysis of the collected evidence indicates that potential sequelae of yaws include congenital, visceral, and tertiary CNS lesions identical to those of venereal syphilis. The current worldwide resurgence of endemic treponematoses provides an unparalleled opportunity to settle conclusively questions still unanswered regarding the natural history of these infections.\r"

From 1980 to 1984, pneumococcal endocarditis was diagnosed in seven patients--four adults and three infants. Apart from one patient who had had a splenectomy, there were no recognizable predisposing factors to infection due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, although all three children were younger than 15 months of age. Congenital heart disease was present in two patients, calcific aortic disease in one, and mitral valve prolapse in a fourth. The remaining three patients had previously normal hearts. Meningitis occurred in five (71%) of the seven patients. Five patients were cured of their infection: four by medical therapy alone (penicillin or vancomycin), and a fifth, by medical therapy plus valvular debridement. Two patients died: one with intractable heart failure, and the second, from the complications of cardiac surgery. Penicillin alone is effective therapy for pneumococcal endocarditis. Patients unable to tolerate penicillin may be treated with vancomycin.\r"

The SBT is basically a variation of the broth dilution test adapted to assess the activity of a treated patient's own serum against the infecting microorganism. Only recently, however, have rigorous attempts been made to standardize all the relevant variables that affect results of the SBT. The widely recommended goal of a peak bactericidal titer of 1:8 in the therapy for infective endocarditis may be inadequate for the treatment of some patients. Peak titers of 1:64 or greater in the microdilution SBT should be sought if they can be achieved without toxicity. Titers of less than 1:8 may be acceptable, although they are less often successful, if serious toxicity would result from increased dosage. Peak SBT titers of 1:8 or greater yield high cure rates for acute osteomyelitis in children; data are limited in adults. A defined SBT method is necessary for additional multicenter clinical trials on which firmer recommendations for its future use can be made.\r"

In recent years there have been major refinements in technical materials used for transporting specimens, growing and identifying anaerobic bacteria and performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Because of the major importance of anaerobic bacteria and their changing susceptibility patterns, it has become increasingly important to identify these organisms and, in certain situations, to determine susceptibilities. The commercial availability of prereduced, anaerobically sterilized systems for identification has been helpful. However, the recent development of rapid identification systems based on tests for preformed enzymes has been a major advance. Finally, the commercial availability of broth microdilution susceptibility systems makes routine testing feasible. Guidelines for using these procedures are presented.\r"

It is said that viral studies are useless since there is no treatment for viral diseases, but suitable therapies are available for a number of severe viral infections. Viral culture results are thought to be too slow to affect patient management, but the average time for detection of a virus is three to four days, and greater than 70% can be reported within five days; detection of viral antigen can be provided in hours. It is thought that viral infections are best diagnosed by serologic tests. However, serologic tests requiring demonstration of a rise in titer or seroconversion are inherently slower than cultures and therefore less useful. Genetic probes are insensitive compared with cultures, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay methods for detecting viral antigen are no more sensitive than fluorescent antibody techniques and do not provide a means of assaying the quality of the sample. Finally, it is often stated that viral studies should be performed only in reference or regional laboratories. Regional virus laboratories should be located in teaching hospitals, and networks should be established to permit hospital laboratories to be involved at different levels.\r"

Virus neutralization titers of these antisera were equivalent to those obtained with purified native gp120 as immunogen. This localizes at least one class of neutralizing epitopes to the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule. In addition, native gp120 prevented HTLV-III/LAV--mediated cell fusion, whereas the recombinant gp120 fragment did not. This shows that although glycosylation is not required for induction of neutralizing antibodies, it may be important for interaction with CD4, the virus receptor. A segment of the HTLV-III/LAV envelope produced in E. coli may be an important ingredient of a vaccine for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\r"

Expression of the beta globin gene in hematopoietic tissues was observed in all transgenic strains. In addition, one strain showed ectopic expression of beta globin in the same tissues that also expressed high levels of RNA from the viral promoter. It is likely that expression from the long terminal repeat (LTR), in contrast to expression from the internal promoter, is dependent on the site of integration. Thus, retroviral vectors can be used for tissue-specific expression of foreign genes in transgenic mice, as well as for the identification of loci that allow developmental activation of a provirus.\r"

The pattern of separation is independent of position in the gel, which is an advantage over previous methods. DNA less than 50 kilobases can be separated without distortion even at high voltage with a nonalternating contour-clamped homogeneous field. Decreased band broadening in DNA less than 200 bases can be achieved with a contour-clamped inhomogeneous field.\r"

Iatrogenic side effects, notably cushingoid features and hypothalamic-pituitary-related adrenal suppression, are dose-related and may be minimized with alternate-day regimens or the use of inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone may facilitate weaning from systemic corticosteroid therapy but usually cannot replace systemic therapy unless the daily dose is less than 20 mg of prednisone or its equivalent. Weaning should be undertaken cautiously, using objective measurements of pulmonary function, to reach a goal of the lowest daily dose consonant with control of symptoms, rather than complete withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "System theory is used to describe the mechanism of the lumbar spine. The role of the spine in vertebrate evolution is presented. The importance of the intervertebral joint for the survival of the species is shown to be crucial. The mechanical behavior of the joint is derived, and from this the corresponding spinal motion and muscular responses is calculated. It is shown that physiologic behavior implies that the stress at the intervertebral joints is equalized and minimized. From this simple condition, the motion of the spine in the sagittal plane is calculated. From the analysis of sagittal plane motion together with a knowledge of the energy transfer through the intervertebral joint, a new theory of locomotion is derived. This theory of locomotion differs in important respects from current theories, but nevertheless explains available experimental data. This unified theory of the function of the human spine permits the determination of the level of safe loads that can be lifted and transported. It predicts the conditions of load transfer through a joint. It proposes a new approach to the mechanism of arthritis and to the repair of fractures.\r"

During this treatment several hypotheses regarding the modes of action of these drugs were examined. A low serotonin hypothesis was supported by the fact that patients who had pain relief following an acute challenge with fenfluramine, a relatively pure releaser of serotonin, were significantly more likely to have pain relief on either antidepressant. The antidepressants did not change cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-endorphin levels, acute pain tolerance, or electromyogram (EMG) levels. The nonsedating antidepressant desipramine was as effective as doxepin; 60% of patients had significant pain relief. Pain relief was associated with depression relief, but several patients had only pain or depression relief. Patients who had a substantial physical basis for their pain responded as well as those who did not.\r"

Many of the effects are transient, and patients who have a good performance status may exhibit minimal alterations in nutritional parameters during the course of treatment. However, antitumor treatment may enhance morbidity, and in some, it leads to mortality if patients are in poor nutritional status ab initio. Such malnourished patients must be recognized prior to initiation of treatment, and steps must be taken to maintain adequate nutrition. The known toxic effects of many cancer therapeutic regimens must be weighed against their potential benefits.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrasonography was used preoperatively in 21 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism in an effort to locate enlarged parathyroid glands. It indicated the presence of a solitary mass compatible with a parathyroid adenoma in 14 patients. At operation, adenomas were found at the location indicated by ultrasonography in 13 of the 14 patients (93 per cent). In seven patients, ultrasonography failed to reveal evidence of a mass of the parathyroid gland. At operation, three had diffuse parathyroid hyperplasia and four had a solitary adenoma. Of the four patients with adenomas undetected by ultrasonography, one patient had an adenoma which had undergone infarction and three had coexisting nodular thyroid gland disease. We concluded that ultrasonography is valuable in the preoperative assessment of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. This is especially so in the absence of coexisting nodular thyroid gland disease. When positive, ultrasonography accurately locates adenomas, and when negative, it strongly suggests the presence of hyperplasia. This may have clinical application in limiting the extent of dissection and, thereby, reducing the morbidity of parathyroid gland exploration.\r"

  ".W": "Whipples triad of hypoglycemic episodes associated with fasting blood sugar levels of less than 50 milligrams per 100 milliliters with relief of the symptoms by the administration of glucose intravenously leads to the clinical diagnosis of insulinoma. This diagnosis can be confirmed in a laboratory by the biochemical measurement of an inappropriate insulin elevation in response to fasting or the infusion of calcium or tolbutamide. Since more than 90 per cent of the tumors are benign, the potential for operative cure is high. Unfortunately, because of multicentricity (12 to 13 per cent) and the frequent small size of the tumor, some series report 15 to 30 per cent of inadequate or failed operations. Preoperative localization, in most centers, has depended upon sonography (positive in one of six patients in our series), computerized tomographic scanning (positive in one of five patients), celiac axis angiography (positive in six of 15 patients) and transportal venous sampling for insulin levels (positive in 11 of 13 patients in our series). We found that the combination of arteriography and transportal sampling has been the most accurate means of precise preoperative localization. In conjunction with preoperative localization, we have used intraoperative monitoring of glucose levels as a guide to the completeness of resection of insulin producing tumors. Sustained elevation of blood glucose levels has confirmed the adequacy of surgical intervention. Failure of the blood sugar level to increase had led to the successful search for additional tumors not identified preoperatively or to further resection. The combination of arteriography, transportal sampling and monitoring of glucose levels has led to the cure of 15 patients operated upon at the Mount Sinai Hospital from 1977 to 1984.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrent nerve palsy, immediate or delayed, or unilateral or bilateral, is a recognized complication of operations upon the thyroid gland and is not considered to be remediable as a presumed consequence of division of the nerve (or nerves). Removal of sutures and neurolysis of the nerve have met with variable success in restoration of function. In a prospective study over a period of 14 years, paralysis after thyroidectomy was assessed in 31 patients. Five had undergone previous operations upon the thyroid gland, four of these patients had known unilateral paralysis and 26 underwent operations which involved exploring the nerves. Immediate removal of the sutures was followed by complete recovery in four of the patients. Fifteen nerves of 13 patients with delayed paralysis were operated upon within six months of the original procedure; ligatures were removed in four patients, the nerve of one patient was sutured and the remaining underwent neurolysis. Some recovery of function within six months was seen in 13 nerves. Nine nerves were operated upon up to one year later, three divided nerves were sutured, one suture around a nerve was removed and five nerves were freed from fibrous tissue; recovery of function was seen in only two nerves. Of all the nerves which were sutured, slight mass movement of the corresponding vocal cord was seen in two. The results indicate that immediate paralysis after thyroidectomy should be investigated immediately, not only to excluded severance but also to relieve, if possible, physical involvement of the nerve by suture or ligature; the outcome of the operation is often beneficial. The benefits of neurolysis when the onset of paralysis is delayed due to fibrosis surrounding the nerve is also discussed; earlier intervention is associated with better results. Direct suture of the divided nerve is not recommended.\r"

We have designed an experiment using dogs to study this problem. We considered an antibiotic to be effective if a single dose reached increased levels in the intestinal tissue to inhibit the growth of the majority of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis strains isolated from the gastrointestinal tract. Of 14 different antibiotics studied, we conclude that carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin, cefbuperazone and cefoxitin as single drugs and Timentin (ticarcillin with clavulanic acid) and clindamycin with gentamicin and co-trimoxazole (trimethoprium and sulfamethoxazole) achieved therapeutic levels. Azlocillin, cefoperazone, cefmenoxime and minocycline failed to achieve significant concentrations. This experiment using dogs was extremely useful to determine the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics in the small intestine and to predict the efficacy of antibiotics considered for prophylaxis.\r"

Its advantages include a better drainage of the peritoneal cavity, a greater protection of the parietes, an improved perfusion of the abdominal viscera and a decrease in postoperative pulmonary complications. It is indicated in patients with severe intra-abdominal sepsis, especially when multiple re-explorations of the abdomen are likely. A variety of techniques, including the use of Marlex mesh have been devised to contend with possible complications: spontaneous fistulas, exogenous bacterial contamination, evisceration and massive fluid losses. The open method of management has not made the treatment of septic abdomen much easier; it requires intensive care support and repeated assessment of the peritoneal cavity. The closure of the abdomen is a problem which must be addressed when the sepsis has subsided. The value of this technique is still difficult to assess in the absence of controlled randomized trials.\r"

  ".W": "Hyperparathyroidism is associated with abnormalities in glucose tolerance and insulin secretion. To assess the effects of hyperparathyroidism on the control of diabetes mellitus, 56 patients with concomitant hyperparathyroidism and diabetes mellitus were studied before and after parathyroidectomy. Fifty patients (89.3%) had hypercalcemia, and six patients (10.7%) had normocalcemia associated with inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone. After surgery, three of five patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus showed more than a 50% reduction in insulin requirement. Thirty-nine of 49 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were followed. Of these, three patients had restoration of normal blood glucose levels without any diabetic treatment including diet restriction. Diabetes control improved in eight parents, remained stable in 18, and deteriorated in 10 patients. In the remaining two patients, impaired glucose tolerance disappeared in one patient and progressed to frank diabetes in the other. Overall 60.7% of the patients improved or remained stable in their diabetes control after parathyroidectomy. We conclude that in patients with hyperparathyroidism, the coexistence of diabetes mellitus might be a further indication for parathyroidectomy. Physicians should be alerted to the possible change in diabetic regimen and the risk of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes after parathyroidectomy.\r"

  ".U": "87070383\r", 
  ".W": "Serious interest in pituitary disease started 100 years ago when acromegaly was described (1886, Marie). Transcranial pituitary operations soon followed (1889, Horsley). Transnasal operations (1907, Schloffer) were complicated by cerebrospinal fluid leakage and meningitis. Improvements led to definitive transseptal (1910, Cushing and Hirsch) and transethmoidal (1911, Chiari) decompressing surgery for tumors. The mortality rate fell below 10%, and relief, mainly from local effects, often followed, sometimes for many years. By 1930 Cushing and most U.S. surgeons used a transcranial approach because suprasellar lesions were inaccessible from below, but several European surgeons continued to use transsphenoidal operations when appropriate (Hirsch, Dott, and Nager). By 1950 antibiotics had reduced infection, and cortisone soon rendered total hypophysectomy by all routes safe for tumorous and normal glands. Microsurgical transethmosphenoidal hypophysectomy was introduced by ear, nose, and throat surgeons (1957 or 1958, Gisselsson, Riskaer, Bateman, MacBeth, and James). Neurosurgeons introduced intraoperative radiofluoroscopy (1957, Guiot), air encephalography, televised fluoroscopy, microsurgical transseptal hypophysectomy, and selective anterior hypophysectomy (1965, Hardy). Microadenomectomy for lesions invisible radiologically was introduced in 1968 (Hardy). The operative death rate is now negligible. Computerized tomographic scanning helps locate tumors, but increasingly surgeons now regard endocrinologic diagnosis alone as justification for operation. Early outcome is excellent, especially in experienced hands, and particularly for noninvasive tumors, but later results are forthcoming.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical features of eight women and three men with nonfunctioning islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas were reviewed. The mean patient age was 58 years (range 44 to 75 years). Weight loss and abdominal pain were the most frequent presenting symptoms. An abdominal mass was palpable in five patients. At operation regional or distant metastases were present in 82% of patients. Only 18% of patients underwent resection for potential cure. All tumors proved histologically to be neuroendocrine in origin. Immunohistochemical staining showed positive reactivity for neuron-specific enolase and chromogranin in all tumors studied but was negative for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Focal positivity for pancreatic polypeptide was seen in one tumor. Nine patients with unresectable disease at operation were available for follow-up. Mean survival for the entire group was 23 +/- 7.2 months (range 4 to 72 months). Survival differences between women and men appeared to favor women but were not statistically significant. Postoperative regional or systemic chemotherapy also had no significant effect on patient survival although two of the longest survivors (36 and 72 months) had received adjunctive chemotherapy. Nonfunctioning islet cell neoplasms are locally aggressive, have a propensity for early metastases, and are rarely resectable for cure. Unlike pancreatic exocrine carcinomas, endocrine malignancies may respond favorably to adjunctive chemotherapy.\r"

We have investigated the effects of a leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, piriprost (U-60, 257) administered by inhalation on allergen and exercise induced bronchoconstriction in 12 subjects with allergic asthma. Subjects underwent diagnostic challenges with allergen and treadmill exercise to define the strengths of the stimuli required to reduce the FEV1 to about 25% of baseline (PS25). On separate study days subjects inhaled either piriprost 1 mg or vehicle placebo, followed 15 minutes later by the PS25 allergen or exercise. The FEV1 was measured at regular intervals before and after challenge up to 60 minutes. After allergen challenge in six subjects peak expiratory flow (PEF) was measured for the following 20 hours. When compared with placebo, inhalation of piriprost had no significant protective effect on the fall in FEV1 at any time point within 60 minutes of allergen or exercise challenge. In the four subjects with a documented late asthmatic reaction 2-12 hours after allergen challenge piriprost had no protective effect when compared with placebo. In the subjects who recorded PEF over 20 hours after allergen challenge there was no significant difference between piriprost and placebo. Piriprost was appreciably more irritant to the respiratory tract than was placebo. On the assumption that inhaled piriprost was bioavailable in the airways, this study casts doubt on any theory of a pivotal role for leukotrienes in the pathogenesis of acute exercise and allergen induced airway bronchoconstriction in asthma.\r"

Fifty patients with worsening airflow obstruction, all of whom were taking oral theophyllines and who had no contraindication to the use of parenteral aminophylline, were randomly allocated into two groups before treatment was given. The dose of aminophylline was calculated without (group A) and with (group B) knowledge of admission serum theophylline concentration. In group A a regimen incorporating corrections to account for factors affecting theophylline clearance was used in an attempt to represent a \"knowledgeable\" approach; in group B a formula incorporating the known serum theophylline concentration at the time of admission was used. All loading doses were given over 30 minutes as \"mini infusions.\" The two groups were well matched for age, blood gas tensions, and severity of airflow obstruction. The results for four patients (one from group A and three from group B) were excluded from analysis after completion of the study. In each group the mean admission serum theophylline concentration measured (group A: 8.4 (SD 6.0)mg/l; group B: 7.2 (5.7)mg/l) and the aminophylline doses used (group A: loading bolus 172 (45.5)mg, infusion 815 (198)mg; group B: loading bolus 233(189)mg, infusion 788(214)mg) were similar. Mean serum theophylline concentrations during 24 hours' aminophylline treatment, number of patients with a serum theophylline concentration greater than 20 mg/l, symptoms of toxicity, and outcome were also similar in the two groups. Although satisfactory use of parenteral aminophylline was achieved for most patients without knowledge of serum theophylline concentration at the time of admission to hospital (with the aid of a \"knowledgeable\" clinical approach and constant infusion pumps), prompt measurement of serum theophylline concentration at the time of admission identified patients with either suboptimal or potentially hazardous theophylline concentrations.\r"

After laboratory studies the patients undertook a randomised domiciliary crossover comparison of bronchodilator response to terbutaline given by metered dose inhaler with and without a spacer device, during which the severity of asthma was assessed by thrice daily recordings of peak expiratory flow (PEF) and symptom score. Improvement in FEV1 produced in the laboratory by the metered dose inhaler with spacer device was significantly greater than by metered dose inhaler alone (p less than 0.001) and similar to that from the nebuliser in both asthmatic groups throughout a range of terbutaline doses. In the domiciliary comparison mean midday and evening PEF rates were significantly higher with the use of the spacer device both in those with severe (p less than 0.01) and in those with moderately severe (p less than 0.05) asthma, and mean morning PEF was significantly higher in the severe group (p less than 0.05). The spacer device also produced a significant improvement in symptom score in both the severe and the moderately severe groups (p less than 0.05). Regular domiciliary use of the spacer device with the metered dose inhaler improves bronchodilator response, particularly in patients with chronic severe asthma, and may be a useful alternative to nebuliser treatment.\r"

Peak expiratory flow was measured twice daily before and after inhalation of 200 micrograms salbutamol in 34 subjects with chronic bronchitis. The FEV1 ranged from 38% to 121% predicted. Diurnal variation (expressed as highest-lowest/highest (%)) was increased in 18 subjects, all but three of whom had airflow obstruction and an increase in methacholine airway responsiveness. There was only a weak correlation between diurnal variation and airway responsiveness (r = -0.54) or the severity of the airflow obstruction. This finding, together with the occurrence of an increase in diurnal variation without an increase in methacholine airway responsiveness in three subjects, suggests that the increased diurnal variation in chronic bronchitis may have a different underlying mechanism from that in asthma.\r"

  ".W": "The concentrations of three known elastase inhibitors (alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor, antileucoprotease, and alpha 2 macroglobulin) have been determined in the sputum of six patients with obstructive bronchitis over five consecutive days. Antileucoprotease was the major inhibitor measured and potentially could provide more than 80% of the elastase inhibition, whereas the contribution of alpha 2 macroglobulin was less than 0.2%. Comparison with the inhibitory capacity of the secretions active against human neutrophil elastase showed that the inhibitors could account for only about half of the inhibition measured. This suggests the presence of a substantial amount of unrecognised inhibitor. Corticosteroid treatment in 10 patients reduced the mean alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor concentration (p less than 0.025) from 18.6 micrograms/ml (SD 22.5) to 9.8 (6.6). Antileucoprotease, however, increased (p less than 0.05) from 20.5 micrograms/ml (24.3) to 39.3 (23.4). These changes were associated with an increase in elastase inhibition (p less than 0.025) from 180 (160) micrograms elastase/ml secretion to 310 (130), suggesting a beneficial effect of steroid treatment on the antielastases in lung secretions.\r"

Each patient underwent a methacholine bronchial challenge test on two separate days one week apart, after having either oral nifedipine (20 mg thrice daily) or placebo for three days. Arterial blood gases were measured before and after methacholine challenge in nine subjects. Prechallenge values of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) were similar after nifedipine and after placebo. After challenge, the cumulative doses of methacholine required to produce a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20 FEV1) were significantly larger after nifedipine (280 (SD 347)) cumulative breath units (CBU) than after placebo (120 (183) CBU; p less than 0.01). After challenge the fall in Pao2 values (17.1 (1.6) mm Hg; (2.28 (0.21) kPa)) was significantly greater than after placebo (11.7 (2.4) mm Hg; (1.56 (0.32) kPa) p less than 0.03). Our data show that although oral nifedipine significantly reduces airway reactivity in patients with mild bronchial asthma, it also adversely affects pulmonary gas exchange, resulting in a lowered postchallenge Pao2, probably because of worsening ventilation-perfusion relationships.\r"

  ".W": "The lung function of 21 patients with leukaemia (11 with acute myeloid leukaemia, six with acute lymphatic leukaemia, four with chronic myeloid leukaemia) and of five with severe aplastic anaemia was tested before and after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Vital capacity (VC) was lowered in patients with leukaemia before transplantation. VC and FEV1 fell significantly after transplantation. Residual volume (RV) and RV as a percentage of total lung capacity (RV % TLC) were already increased and rose significantly after transplantation. Patients with severe aplastic anaemia had noticeably increased RV and RV % TLC, values that did not change after transplantation. In contrast to the patients with aplastic anaemia, the patients with leukaemia had significantly reduced VC, RV, RV % TLC, and FEV1 before and after transplantation. The specific airway resistance (sRaw) was raised significantly before and after transplantation in the leukaemic patients. In addition, transfer coefficient (Kco) fell significantly more after transplantation in the patients with leukaemia than in those with severe aplastic anaemia. In three patients with histologically established obstructive bronchiolitis in conjunction with chronic graft versus host disease after transplantation, VC, FEV1 and FEV1 % VC fell, while RV, RV % TLC, and sRaw rose; Kco was far below normal. On the basis of these findings it is concluded that in patients with leukaemia obstructive disorders of ventilation develop or, if they are already present, worsen. In patients with severe aplastic anaemia lung function was not impaired in the early phase after transplantation. These differences are probably due to the more intensive immunosuppressive and cytotoxic preparatory regimen before transplantation in the leukaemic patients. Obstructive bronchiolitis, a complication of graft versus host disease, first manifests itself in a typical rise in specific airway resistance and must be treated early.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of controlling childhood asthma of the same daily dose (400 micrograms) of beclomethasone dipropionate, given in two or four equal divided doses from a metered aerosol, were compared in a double blind crossover study. Thirty one children aged 6-14 years completed the study. They had previously been shown to need beclomethasone by showing either symptoms or reduced peak flow when the treatment was withdrawn. They recorded their daytime and night time symptoms on a visual analogue scale and their morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), and recorded their symptomatic use of bronchodilator aerosols. Spirometry was performed at the end of each treatment period. Control of asthma was good on both regimens. There were small differences in both objective and subjective measurements in favour of the four times daily regimen, but none reached statistical significance, apart from patients' assessment of daytime wheeze (p less than 0.05). In particular, the differences in the results of lung function tests were very small. Compliance was better for morning and evening doses. These results suggest that beclomethasone given as 200 micrograms twice daily is effective in controlling mild childhood asthma. It may be preferable to 100 micrograms four times daily because of better compliance and because it is unnecessary to take medication to school.\r"

The mean serial PEF after a one week run in period was 189 1 min-1, during the second week of placebo 193 1 min-1, and during the second week on prednisolone 231 1 min-1. The difference in mean PEF values between placebo and prednisolone was significant (p less than 0.01). With regard to the response to steroids of the individual patients, 13 of the 33 had a detectable trend of improvement on visual inspection of serial PEF measurements during prednisolone treatment but only one during placebo administration. Of all the objective measurements made after the run in and after each treatment phase (12 minute walking distance, FEV1, forced vital capacity (FVC), serial PEF), the serial PEF chart provided the best discrimination between placebo and prednisolone treatment. There was no statistically significant association between steroid induced improvement in serial PEF measurements and in breathlessness, partly because of placebo improvements in symptoms in those who had no improvement in serial PEF values. This study indicates the importance of making objective measurements to identify a genuine steroid response rather than relying on symptomatic improvement alone. The best simple measurement to make is serial PEF during steroid trials. This is more sensitive in detecting a steroid response than are the 12 minute walking distance, FEV1, or FVC, and is also less likely than these measurements to show spurious placebo responses.\r"

  ".W": "Most patients with chronic obstructive lung disease prescribed oxygen at home by their family doctor use it for short periods when they feel breathless. Many patients are normoxic. Nineteen patients with advanced disease and variable hypoxaemia undertook exercise until they indicated severe breathlessness on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Air, 67% oxygen, and air delivered from a cylinder in an identical manner to the oxygen were randomly administered during the recovery periods. Respiratory rate, heart rate and oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions, estimated by transcutaneous electrodes (tcPo2, tcPco2), were measured throughout the exercise and recovery periods. The mean recovery time for breathlessness as judged by visual analogue score was significantly shorter when oxygen was used than during placebo or air recovery (p less than 0.05). The rates of return to baseline levels of respiratory and heart rates were not significantly affected by the gas inhaled. No placebo effect was detectable. It was not possible to select good responders from the results of prior physiological tests. In seven patients the study was repeated after an interval of between one week and a year. The consistency of observed response to oxygen was poor. Although recovery judged by visual analogue scores showed some consistency within individual patients and greater overall consistency than heart rate or respiratory rate, the direction of change in recovery judged by visual analogue score after the breathing of oxygen was variable. The change during the breathing of oxygen was towards improvement in both studies in three patients and towards deterioration in both studies in one patient, and it showed no consistent direction of change in the remaining three patients. It is difficult to determine which patients will derive substantial and reproducible benefit from short burst oxygen but their numbers are probably small. The results cast doubt on the justification for the current widespread prescription of oxygen cylinders for occasional use.\r"

The exact mechanism of this effect is unclear but it is presumed to be a result of ventilatory stimulation. To determine whether the ability to correct arterial blood gas abnormalities by voluntary hyperventilation would predict a subsequent favourable response to progesterone, we studied 11 subjects with chronic obstructive lung disease and chronic hypercapnia. Five subjects had chronic obstructive lung disease of moderate severity with mean (SE) FEV1 1.8 (0.34) 1 maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) 40.4 (7.16) 1/min-1, arterial oxygen tension (Pao2) 53.8 (2.40 mm Hg, and arterial carbon dioxide tension Paco2) 49.6 (3.91) mm Hg, and were able to normalise their blood gas tensions during voluntary hyperventilation (Pao2 85.4 (8.01) mm Hg; Paco2 32.8 (3.43) mm Hg). Six subjects had severe chronic obstructive lung disease with FEV1 0.77 (0.12) 1, MVV 19 (3.09) 1/min-1, Pao2 60.0 (2.89) mm Hg and Paco2 50.5 (1.38) mm Hg, and they could not significantly alter their blood gases with voluntary hyperventilation (Pao2 62.5 (3.19) mm Hg, Paco2 49.7 (1.84) mm Hg). The groups were similar in age, height, weight, and resting Pao2 and Paco2. Each subject received one month of oral placebo and one month of medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera). 20 mg orally thrice daily, given in a randomised, double blind fashion. The groups responded similarly with a significantly higher Pao2 and lower Paco2 while having medroxyprogesterone acetate than while having placebo. Two patients with polycythaemia showed a reduction in haemoglobin concentration while taking progesterone. It is concluded that the response to medroxyprogesterone is not predictable from spirometric or blood gas changes after voluntary hyperventilation.\r"

Only nephrotoxic cardiac transplant patients showed a significant alteration of increased AUC:dose and drug half-life compared with patients with normal renal function, a similar change to that observed in nephrotoxic renal transplant patients. Pediatric compared with adult renal recipients showed a threefold increased rate of mean drug clearance, namely 39.6 mL/min/kg in children v 12.3 mL/min/kg in adults, which may explain the almost 50% reduction in area under the plasma concentration curve v the time curve. There also appeared to be somewhat better oral absorption of CsA by children. Study of greater numbers of cardiac transplant recipients will be necessary to detect the subtle impact of demographic factors on pharmacokinetic parameters.\r"

  ".W": "Serum trough levels in the early post-renal transplant course were set at 175 to 200 ng/mL in spite of a standard drug administration regimen by selecting once- v twice-daily dosing intervals, in order to attempt to compensate for differences in drug clearance rates, which might determine trough values. When pretransplant pharmacokinetic parameters were correlated with posttransplant events, patients dosed twice daily were at greater risk of rejection if they displayed a low AUC IV, a rapid CL, or a large Vd. On the other hand, once-daily-treated patients experienced infections if the AUC PO or Cmax was large or drug clearance was low. Patients treated twice daily displayed hepatotoxicity if their AUC IV was high and their Vd and CL low. Nephrotoxicity was seen in patients of both groups with high AUC IV and low CL. Comparison of pre- v posttransplant pharmacokinetic profiles correlated with rejection if the postoperative study showed a reduced Cmax and with hepatotoxicity if the AUC PO and F values were higher than preoperatively. The overall results suggested (although cadaver transplant outcome did not confirm) a lower incidence of rejection on the twice-daily compared with the once-daily regimen. There was no significant difference in the incidence of toxic complications between the groups. However, all of the patients who experienced nephrotoxicity during twice-daily therapy improved when converted to once-daily treatment. The present study suggests that specific values can be established for pharmacokinetic parameters, which would permit clinicians to individually tailor posttransplant immunosuppression to optimize the therapeutic effects of CsA.\r"

Additional information has been gained by HPLC profiles in nontransplant subjects who are healthy or have a stable disease state. The clinician now knows that liver disease not only impairs Cs elimination but may also have a pronounced effect upon drug absorption. While the cardiac failure patient may have reversible inhibition of Cs clearance, other factors may affect the distribution of the drug to lower dosage requirements. Impaired renal function is not an impediment to Cs elimination, but malabsorption similar to that observed in liver and bone marrow transplant patients may still occasionally complicate therapy. Pharmacokinetic information on Cs must be integrated into the complex care plan of a transplant patient to optimally utilize and monitor this pharmacologic agent.\r"

Although concentrations of CsA plus metabolites in bile measured by RIA were 18 to 36 times higher than HPLC concentrations, they accounted for less than 50% of an absorbed CsA dose. By means of mass spectrometry and HPLC retention times of known metabolites, peaks equivalent to the previously isolated CsA M8, M13, M17, M1, M18, and M21 of Maurer et al were found in the ether extracts of bile.

Absorption is probably improved by thorough dispersion of the oral solution of CsA in the drink the patient prefers. Evidence for GI metabolism of CsA has only been gathered in animal experiments. The importance of bile for absorption of CsA into the portal blood is established. The bioavailability of CsA does not seem to be determined by the metabolism during the first passage through the liver. Enterohepatic recycling is likely for CsA metabolites and unlikely for unchanged CsA. A pharmacokinetic model that assumes zero-order absorption of CsA describes human data better than a model with first-order absorption. According to the zero-order model, CsA is absorbed only in the upper part of the small intestine by a mechanism that operates under saturation. Two independent findings in transplantation patients support this model. First, it was shown that small doses of CsA produce disproportionally high blood concentrations, probably due to a better bioavailability. Second, accelerated transit times in the intestine (diarrhea) lead to unexpectedly low blood concentrations, probably due to poor bioavailability. Further factors have been identified that cause low absorption of CsA: liver dysfunction and external bile drainage after liver transplantation. The influence of food on the absorption of CsA is still not determined conclusively, but it seems that giving CsA together with a standard breakfast results in higher blood concentrations. The observed increase in the bioavailability of CsA with time after transplantation could be caused by the attempt to steadily lower the dose.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of 178 consecutive subtraction hip arthrograms (175 patients) was performed to evaluate the significance of cavities or bursal communications (or both) with the pseudocapsule in patients with painful hip arthroplasty. Bursae and/or communicating cavities were shown in 75 (43%) of the 175 patients. Communicating irregular cavities were noted in 12 patients (nine infected), and smooth bursae or bursalike structures were noted in 63 patients. The most frequent bursal locations were the greater trochanteric region (32/63), supraacetabular region (18/63), and iliopsoas (12/63). Three patients had multiple bursae. Six of the 18 acetabular bursae were associated with previous dislocations. Twenty-seven patients with bursae had no radiographic findings of loosening or infection. Of these 27, 12 (44%) responded to local injection of anesthetic into the bursa and were judged clinically to have bursitis. Arthrography, with aspiration from the bursae or cavities and injection of anesthetic, provides additional information regarding painful hip arthroplasty and may prevent unnecessary surgery.\r"

Comparison of the presumed clinical location and the sonographic location, however, revealed a significant discrepancy. Only seven of 15 hematomas that were clinically suspected to be in the iliopsoas muscle were confirmed by sonography at that location. Of the remaining cases, three were localized in the hip joint, one in the proximal thigh, one in the abdominal wall, and one in the iliac fossa. Hemorrhage was not found in two cases. This study indicates that sonography provides valuable information about the site of hematoma in these patients.\r"

  ".U": "87073035\r", 
  ".W": "A retrospective study of 55 twin pregnancies was performed to determine the role of sonography in distinguishing between dichorionic and monochorionic diamniotic gestations solely by evaluating the thickness of the membrane between the fetuses. The presence of a thick dividing membrane indicated a dichorionic diamniotic gestation in 38 (90%) of 42 cases in which it was identified. Inability to identify a membrane between dichorionic diamniotic twins occurred most commonly during the third trimester. A thin membrane indicated monochorionic diamniotic twinning and was seen in three (25%) of 12 cases. Membrane thickness was indeterminate in one case. Therefore, on the basis of the thickness of the dividing membrane imaged by sonography, dichorionic diamniotic gestations can be distinguished from monochorionic diamniotic gestations. Inability to show a separating membrane by sonography, however, can occur with any form of twin gestation, particularly in the third trimester. Membrane thickness should be used in conjunction with other sonographic criteria to predict the amnionicity and chorionicity of twin gestations.\r"

  ".W": "The sonograms of 195 singleton pregnancies complicated by polyhydramnios were reviewed, and follow-up information was obtained on 191 patients. A grading system was developed that differentiated mild from severe polyhydramnios using real-time or static sonographic equipment. Mild polyhydramnios was present in 138 (71%), and severe polyhydramnios was present in 57 (29%). Previously it has been reported that 60% of cases of polyhydramnios are idiopathic and the pregnancies have a normal outcome. Twenty percent are associated with maternal abnormalities and 20% are associated with fetal anomalies. In this study, pregnancies with severe polyhydramnios had a much greater prevalence of fetal anomalies (75%) than pregnancies with mild polyhydramnios (29%). The 57 singleton pregnancies with severe polyhydramnios were analyzed in depth. Fourteen (25%) of the fetuses were normal; 43 (75%) had significant congenital abnormalities that predominantly involved the CNS, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and genitourinary tract. In all fetuses with primary CNS abnormalities, polyhydramnios was diagnosed at or before 30 weeks of gestation, while in most of the fetuses (83%) with gastrointestinal abnormalities it was diagnosed after 30 weeks. Sonographic findings correlated closely with the findings noted at birth or autopsy. In patients with severe polyhydramnios, normal sonograms were sensitive in excluding major congenital anomalies and, thus, were helpful in providing the parents with favorable prognoses. Sonograms should be performed in patients with polyhydramnios to identify congenital anomalies and to provide information regarding prognosis for fetal outcome.\r"

The location of hemorrhage was subchorionic in 46 cases (81%), retroplacental in nine cases (16%), and preplacental in two cases (4%). Subchorionic hematomas were more frequently shown in the 33 patients presenting before 20 menstrual weeks (91%) than in the 24 patients presenting after 20 weeks (67%). The echogenicity of hemorrhage depended on the time the sonogram was performed relative to the onset of symptoms: Acute hemorrhage was hyperechoic to isoechoic compared with the placenta, while resolving hematomas became hypoechoic within 1 week and sonolucent within 2 weeks. Acute hemorrhage was occasionally difficult to distinguish from the adjacent placenta. This occurred in five retroplacental hematomas that showed only an abnormally thick and heterogeneous placenta. Nine cases of placental abruption were initially confused with other mass lesions. Placental abruption causes a wide spectrum of sonographic findings that may be overlooked or misdiagnosed.\r"

A protocol for the complete and rapid exploration of epistaxis is suggested that is based upon which arteries providing blood to the nasal fossa may be responsible for the bleeding and the most optimal way for their demonstration and evaluation. The relevant anatomy of the major arteries, their branches, and important anastomoses are described. The goals of embolization are to control severe or recurrent epistaxis, prevent recurrence if possible, and avoid occlusion of any vessels not responsible for the hemorrhage. The most appropriate embolic material is chosen, realizing that recurrence can be caused by the use of resorbable embolic material or by a very proximal or too complete embolization. Embolization may be used for specific causes of epistaxis including idiopathic, hereditary hemorraghic telangiectasia, hemorrhagic tumors, vascular malformations, trauma, disorders of hemostasis, and postsurgical problems. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are discussed with respect to their clinical presentation, classification, computed tomographic, MR imaging, and angiographic evaluation, treatment, future trends in treatment, and precautions and complications.\r"

This paper attempts to help the radiologist obtain informed consent without incurring malpractice liability by discussing the important legal concept of simple consent as distinguished from informed consent, the elements a patient must prove to succeed in court with an allegation of lack of informed consent, the varying state requirements about the amount of information the patient must be given, the persons who must obtain consent from the patient, and the persons who can give consent for the patient. Consent for IV injections of contrast medium and consent forms are discussed because of the current controversy on these subjects. Courts and state legislatures have usually addressed only specific aspects of informed consent. However, except for the amount of information that must be given the patient, the courts have been relatively uniform in their requirements. Therefore, it is likely that a state court faced with issues of informed consent about which no law exists in their own state will use the existing law in other states as a precedent and adopt similar rules. However, each radiologist must be familiar with the specific rules for informed consent that have been developed by the courts and legislatures in the state in which he or she practices.\r"

However, less is known about the subclinical (not palpable) varicocele and its relationship to infertility. We undertook this study to compare the ability of high-resolution sonography and radionuclide scrotal scanning to detect subclinical varicocele. Fifty patients who were referred to our department with a diagnosis of infertility, an abnormal semen analysis, and a normal physical examination of the scrotum underwent both sonography and nuclear scanning. The final study group included 20 men who agreed to surgical ligation of the spermatic vein(s) after a positive sonographic and/or radionuclide study. Sonography was considered positive for subclinical varicocele in 95% of patients, while nuclear scanning was considered positive in only 55%. Postoperatively, all patients showed improvement in their semen and 40% (eight patients) became fertile. Subclinical varicocele seems to be an important causal factor in infertility and, in our experience, high-resolution sonography is superior to radionuclide scanning in its diagnosis.\r"

Preoperatively, 11 of 15 children had systolic hypertension at rest and 12 of 15 after exercise. After surgery, only one child had mild systolic hypertension at rest, whereas exercise-induced hypertension persisted in 33% of patients (all older than 10 years). Exercise plasma renin activity was elevated preoperatively but normalized following surgery. No significant difference was seen in resting and exercise plasma catecholamine levels measured before and after surgery. Over the follow-up period of 6 months, echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy regressed in the younger patients but not in the older patients with exercise-induced hypertension. Exercise testing defines a subgroup of patients with exercise-induced hypertension evident soon after surgery. Structural upper segment arterial vessel wall changes in the older patient may explain these observations.\r"

Two patients were less than 6 months of age, two were between 14 and 20 months, and two were ages 4 and 53 years. Four of the six patients had abnormal esophagrams. Five patients underwent peripheral intravenous digital subtraction angiography and a sixth patient underwent digital subtraction angiography via arterial catheterization. In two patients (ages 20 months and 4 years), the presence of a vascular ring was excluded by demonstrating an anatomically normal arch with an anomalous right subclavian artery. In three patients, a right aortic arch was present. Two of these patients had mirror image branching and a left ligamentum arteriosum. The third patient had an aberrant left subclavian artery and a left ligamentum. One patient had an anomalous right subclavian artery and a systemic collateral vessel arising from the aorta, supplying a confluence of vessels in the right lung hilum. In all patients, anatomic definition was accurate with the intravenous injection and there were no complications. In the patient who underwent intra-arterial injection, the dose of contrast was reduced 50% from the dose usually administered. Digital subtraction angiography appears to be a good adjunctive diagnostic method in patients in whom the presence of a vascular ring needs to be confirmed angiographically and obviates the need for arterial catheterization.\r"

Trans acid availability has changed little during the last 15-20 yr and currently is estimated to be approximately 7.6 g X person-1 X day-1. Modest decreases in total fat intake, including trans fatty acid intake, may occur in the future if consumers adopt certain dietary recommendations. We believe that concerns about possible relationships of trans fatty acids to development of atherosclerotic disease or cancer are not supported by reliable data. Numerous literature accounts support the conclusion that trans fatty acids do not pose any harm to humans or animals consuming a balanced diet containing adequate linoleic acid.\r"

The increase in oxygen consumption during a norepinephrine infusion was the same before (20 +/- 2%) and after (17 +/- 3%) overfeeding. Overfeeding elevated basal insulin concentrations in all subjects and increased the insulin response to intravenous glucose in four of five subjects. Overfeeding did not significantly alter mean serum T3 concentrations or erythrocyte 86Rb uptake (an index of Na+,K+-ATPase activity). These data do not confirm reports that overfeeding increases metabolic rate more during exercise than during rest. They also suggest that the increase in resting metabolic rate during overfeeding is not caused by increased responsiveness to norepinephrine or increased serum T3 concentrations.\r"

Plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, alpha-amino nitrogen (AAN), and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) responses were then determined over 4 h. Protein stimulated only a modest insulin rise and the area above fasting baseline was only 28% of that after glucose. The sum of the serum insulin area following protein ingestion and that following glucose ingestion was 100.4% of the combination meal. C-peptide changes confirmed the insulin response. The addition of glucose to the protein meal resulted in a 60 min delay in glucagon and AAN rise compared to the protein meal alone. Subsequently AAN and glucagon increased to levels greater than or equal to those observed after protein ingestion alone. In summary, protein is a much less potent secretagogue for insulin than is glucose in normal individuals, and the effect on insulin secretion is not synergistic. Addition of glucose to a protein meal results in a delayed rise in AAN and glucagon concentrations in normal subjects.\r"

Renal biopsy revealed only mild mesangial proliferation or minor glomerular changes on light microscopic examination but typical features of IgA nephropathy on immunofluorescent and electron microscopic examination. A satisfactory response characterized by correction of hypoalbuminemia, clearance of proteinuria, and an increase of endogenous creatinine clearance occurred with corticosteroid therapy. These cases represent a variant of IgA nephropathy associated with a nephrotic syndrome that resembles lipoid nephrosis in its responsiveness to steroid.\r"

It avoids procedures that could artifactually affect lymphocyte subsets. The lower T4:T8 ratios revealed in this study could result because of technical reasons.\r"

A group of 408 gram-negative rods that were isolated on primary isolation plates were tested with the use of both the kit and complete bacterial identification. The RIM E. coli Kit identified 92.5% (272 of 294) of the E. coli isolates. Only 1 of 114 non-E. coli isolates was misidentified as E. coli (positive predictive value equal to 99.6). Although the RIM E. coli Kit was sufficiently rapid (less than one hour), any supply cost savings would depend upon the proportion of true E. coli in the group of organisms tested. Savings derived from the lower cost of using the RIM E. coli Kit would be reduced by the extra cost of screening non-E. coli isolates, which would then have to be completely identified.\r"

However, 14 of 24 (58.3%) of these HSV-1 antibody-negative sera were positive at greater than or equal to 1:10 with the use of the HSV-1 IFA kit from Electronucleonics, 15 of 24 (62.5%) were positive with the Clinical Sciences HSV-1 IFA kit, 4 of 24 (16.7%) were positive with Zeus Scientific, and 4 of 18 (22.2%) were positive with the Gull Laboratories product. HSV-1 induces Fc receptors that commonly cause false positive IFA tests for HSV antibody. Therefore, further studies were undertaken to determine whether Fc receptors accounted for these false positive results. Staphylococcal protein A (SPA) is known to bind to the Fc portion of human IgG and therefore could be used to distinguish between the binding of an antibody by its Fab or its Fc portion. Thus, when fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated (FITC) SPA was used as conjugate instead of FITC antibody to human IgG, true HSV-1 antibody-containing sera remained positive, but the false positives identified in the commercial IFA kits did not. The authors conclude that HSV-1-induced Fc receptors are responsible for most of the problem of these false positives and that HSV-1 serology probably should not be done by this type of IFA method until this problem is corrected.\r"

Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients, but rarely, if ever, cause glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70% to 80%. Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy, plasma aminoglycoside levels, liver disease, advanced age, high initial estimated creatinine clearance and, possibly, female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity. Other causes of acute renal failure, such as shock, appear to have an additive effect. Predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high risk. These models may also be useful in developing insights into the pathophysiology of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity.\r"

The nephrotoxic injury, which may present acutely in the peritransplant period, subacutely in the first few months, or chronically, may be caused by toxic effects at various levels of the nephron: arteriole, glomerulus, and/or proximal tubule. The nephrotoxic picture of decreased glomerular filtration rate, impaired urea secretion, hyperkalemia, hypertension, and tubular dysfunction with preserved sodium reabsorption occurs not only in the renal allotransplant setting, wherein it obscures the diagnosis of rejection, but also in recipients of other grafts and patients under treatment for autoimmune disease. Because conversion from CsA to other immunosuppressive agents carries a high risk of rejection and allograft loss (or recrudescence of autoimmune disease), the present management strategy uses cautious CsA does reduction with concomitant institution of full-dose azathioprine (Aza) therapy. Definition of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that predict patients at risk for nephrotoxic complications may lead to new CsA dosing regimens yielding an improved therapeutic index.\r"

  ".W": "The glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as measured by the clearance of inulin, was depressed severely in 34 heart transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine (CsA) for 12 months or longer. The clearance of 99mTc-DTPA, a filtration marker similar in size to creatinine, was identical to that of the larger inulin molecule. In contrast, the clearance of creatinine was enhanced (P less than .01) such that its fractional clearance (relative to inulin) averaged 1.51 +/- 0.05. Moreover, there was an inverse relationship between fractional creatinine clearance (r = 0.36, P less than .01) and absolute inulin clearance. We conclude that in CsA-induced chronic nephropathy 99mDTPA and inulin are unrestricted by the glomerular capillary wall and behave as true filtration markers, creatinine is progressively hypersecreted by renal tubules as the nephropathy worsens, and the ensuing enhancement of creatinine clearance over GFR blunts the expected rise in serum creatinine levels as GFR falls. As a result, serum creatinine in chronic CsA-induced glomerulopathy exceeds 2 mg/dL consistently, only after true GFR has become depressed below normal values by two thirds or more.\r"

We review their prevalence and clinical relevance, and identify the patients who are most at risk for these complications. NSAIDs induce hemodynamic renal failure in states of compromised renal perfusion and in the presence of a preexisting nephropathy. Association of triamterene and indomethacin is especially nephrotoxic and should be avoided. NSAIDs cause sodium retention and impair the natriuretic effect of diuretics: this side effect is clinically relevant in edema-forming states. Hyperkalemia induced by NSAIDs is harmful in case of renal failure and hypoaldosteronism. NSAIDs may induce an acute interstitial nephritis often associated with the nephrotic syndrome; the event is rare and unpredictable, and mainly propionic acid derivatives have been incriminated. NSAIDs are reported to attenuate the hypotensive effect of various drugs; further studies are warranted to better delineate the clinical relevance of this observation.\r"

  ".W": "Cis-dichlorodiammine platinum (II), or cisplatin, has emerged as a principal chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of otherwise resistant solid tumors and is currently among the most widely used agents in the chemotherapy of cancer. The chief limit to its greater efficacy is its nephrotoxicity, which has made it necessary both to lower its dosage and actively hydrate patients to reduce it. The vulnerability of the kidney to cisplatin is almost certainly related to its primary role in the excretion of cisplatin. Cisplatin enters renal cells by a process that depends on normal oxygen utilization and is specifically inhibited by organic bases. Greater localization of platinum to the S3 segment of the proximal tubules suggests that the vulnerability of this segment may depend on its specific uptake of the drug. The majority of intracellular platinum is bound to macromolecules, including protein and DNA, yet a significant portion of cell platinum is biotransformed to a nonmutagenic and possibly nontoxic compound. Polyuria and hypomagnesemia, which are commonly associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity, may be due to defects in deep nephron or collecting duct fluid and solute transport. Low single nephron glomerular filtration rates (SNGFR) during early cisplatinum-induced acute renal failure is accompanied by reduced renal blood flow and transglomerular hydrostatic pressure without elevated intratubular hydrostatic pressure, suggesting preglomerular vasoconstriction as an important determinant of renal failure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Several antineoplastic agents are potentially nephrotoxic; previous renal impairment as well as combinations with other nephrotoxic drugs may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity during administration of chemotherapy. Methotrexate-related renal damage most frequently occurs with high-dose therapy and can be avoided by forced alkaline diuresis and administration of folinic acid. Renal dysfunction secondary to semustine (CH3-CCNU) is clearly related to cumulative doses in excess to 1,200 mg/m2; the onset may be delayed and renal failure progress despite drug discontinuation. Streptozotocin is also nephrotoxic and may cause proteinuria and renal tubular acidosis; progressive renal failure can be predicted by a close monitoring of proteinuria and prevented by drug discontinuance. Mitomycin-associated renal failure frequently presents with signs of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; renal failure is usually delayed but occasionally, it may be rapidly progressive despite drug discontinuance. Cisplatin nephrotoxicity is clearly dose-related and used to be considered dose limiting. Renal insufficiency can be prevented by hydration and forced diuresis; in addition, hyperhydration with mannitol-induced saline diuresis may allow administration of high doses and thus circumvent the dose-limiting effect of cisplatin-induced renal toxicity. Cisplatin-induced renal magnesium wasting occurs frequently and should be supplemented. Other approaches to reduce cisplatin nephrotoxicity are currently under investigation and are discussed.\r"

Ipratropium does not exhibit the well-known toxic effects of atropine, and doses many times those required for maximum therapeutic benefit do not produce any effects on the eye, urinary bladder, heart rate, or mucociliary function.
