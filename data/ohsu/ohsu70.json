CSF somatostatin immunoreactivity was 166 +/- 5.3 (SFM) pg/ml in controls at noon and rose around midnight to 208 +/- 3.8 pg/ml, then decreased to basal levels at about 5 hours and exhibited another small peak 3 hours later. Almost identical patterns were found in patients with MS during stable phase. During relapse, CSF somatostatin was reduced to 99 +/- 9.2 pg/ml and showed no variation from this value. CSF albumin was similar in the three groups and exhibited no fluctuations. Diurnal patterns of serum growth hormone were similar and unrelated to the oscillations in CSF somatostatin, indicating that hypothalamic release was insignificant in the overall production and in variations. The observation that the CNS releases somatostatin at lower levels during relapse in MS and that these do not oscillate may suggest that the constant low contents represent passive spillover from somatostatin-containing neurons, while the undulating levels above them are representative of active, yet unknown neurophysiologic (eg, neurotransmitter) functions which become reversibly extinct in relapse.\r"

A statistically significant 30 to 40% increase in the number of benzodiazepine and allosterically linked GABA-A receptors is observed in the midfrontal cortex (A9/A10), but in no other cortical region examined. The degree of enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding by a given dose of GABA or pentobarbital is significantly reduced in Huntington's disease midfrontal cortex. As in the case of receptor number changes, other cortical regions examined show less prominent changes in regulation of benzodiazepine binding by GABA or pentobarbital. Direct identification of the benzodiazepine binding subunit by photoaffinity labeling with [3H]flunitrazepam reveals a single species of apparent molecular weight 51 kD in patients and controls, suggesting that gross changes in structure of the benzodiazepine binding subunit do not account for the observed alterations in benzodiazepine receptor regulation.\r"

Descending corticofacial fibers innervated the lower facial motor nuclear region bilaterally, although with contralateral predominance. The upper facial motor nuclear regions received scant direct cortical innervation on either side of the brain. Our results indicate that upper facial movement, like that at the shoulder, is relatively preserved in upper motor neuron palsy because these motor neurons receive little direct cortical input. By contrast, the lower facial muscles, like those of the hand, are more severely affected because their motor neurons normally depend upon significant cortical innervation.\r"

Compared with controls, two-point discrimination thresholds were significantly higher (p less than 0.02) on the index finger of PD patients, but not on the forearm. Results confirm the sensorimotor deficits found earlier in an orofacial study, and imply that PD involves a generalized dysfunction of sensorimotor integration and proprioception, probably a result of impaired basal ganglia function in processing and integrating sensory input to organize and guide movement.\r"

Because the right hemisphere seems dominant for mediating arousal, which is an important determinant of the capacity for cerebral activation, we predicted that subjects with right hemisphere damage would have a greater reduction in the capacity for cerebral activation than subjects with left hemisphere damage. A paradigm requiring that two simple tasks be performed singly and simultaneously was used to assess the capacity for activation. Subjects with right hemisphere damage had significantly greater impairment in the capacity for cerebral activation than subjects with left hemisphere damage. This impairment may partly explain the associations between right hemisphere damage and decreased ability to perform certain analytic and linguistic tasks.\r"

The language ability of the patients on entry to the study, their scores on a brief screening test of cognitive function, and their overall ratings of clinical dementia were found to be predictors of subsequent institutional care and death. The age of the patients had a significant modifying effect on these predictive factors, resulting in a greater risk of institutionalization and death in younger patients with severe cognitive impairment as compared with older individuals with the same degree of dysfunction.\r"

It was shown that the conventional optical system as well as a fiber optic system are both able to perforate the iris completely and to blast away or destroy the pigment epithelium. One merit of the fiber optic system as compared to the conventional system is that it requires considerably less energy for the same effect. This is partially because the sclera, when compressed, becomes more transparent and thus transmits a greater amount of laser energy.\r"

Postoperatively, with an average follow-up of six months, Group 2 had significantly lower intraocular pressures, reduced glaucoma medication requirements, and increased cystic bleb formation. Vision did not differ significantly between the two groups postoperatively, although two Group 1 patients developed progressive glaucomatous visual loss. Complications were slightly more frequent in Group 2. The results of this study suggest that a full thickness sclerectomy technique merits consideration as the initial filtration procedure of choice in West Indian blacks with advanced open angle glaucoma.\r"

The description of senile sclerotic glaucoma is new as are the differences in the chamber angle and peripapillary atrophy. The size of the visual field defects in the upper and lower half of the visual field is similar in high tension glaucoma. In senile sclerotic glaucoma the larger defect tends to be in the upper half of the visual field. It is suggested that in senile sclerotic glaucoma the primary cause of damage is local vascular disease, and that in high tension glaucoma the intraocular pressure with a secondary role for an insufficient blood supply is the major cause of damage. Primary open angle glaucoma can be characterized by the ratio of pressure risk factors and vascular risk factors.\r"

Fiberoptics of 200 microns diameter, with either cleaved or 500 microns ball lens tips, were coupled to the output of an argon gas laser emitting a number of radiation lines in the ultraviolet (333 to 363 nm) wavelengths. This system was used to perforate the corneoscleral limbal tissue of enucleated bovine eyes with a small number of laser applications to create a filtering fistula. Corneoscleral limbal perforation with a 200 microns cleaved fiber required 0.6 to 1.1 J total energy, delivered with a laser power of 0.5 W, or greater, for 0.1 second. With a 500 microns ball lens fiber tip a tract of nearly 0.5 mm diameter was created, requiring 5.1 to 10.4 J total energy, delivered with a laser power of 2.0 W, or greater, for at least 0.1 second. The energy required for perforation from the external surface to the anterior chamber was the same as the energy required for ab interno perforation.\r"

The complications of this lens includes a much higher than normal rate of chronic inflammation, cystoid macular edema, glaucoma, hyphema, vitreous hemorrhage, and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. These complications together constitute the multiple manifestations of the UGH Plus syndrome. These complications tend to increase with time. The failure of the 91Z can be ascribed to problems of design and manufacturing causing excess movement, vaulting, and irritation of ocular tissue. Patients with this implant need to be notified of the high complication rate and the need for frequent follow-up. Most 91Z complications are recurrent or persistent and respond best to removal of the implant. Removal of the 91Z requires special technique to avoid traumatizing the eye. The design, materials, testing, manufacture, and recall of the 91Z needs close study to prevent another such problem prone lens from reaching widespread use.\r"

Increased uptake in the tumor-bearing eye as compared to the fellow nontumor bearing eye was found in 7 out of 10 cases when the probe was located 3.5 cm in front of the eye (p less than 0.01). By using a double pinhole collimator tests were positive in 3 out of 10 123I-ITU studies only. Tests with 123I-ITU were compared with 67Ga tests in the same patients. The 67Ga tests with the single eye probe collimator were positive in 6 out 10 cases when the probe was located 6 cm in front of the eye. With the double pinhole collimator tests were positive in 7 out of 10 67Ga studies.

The outward carboxyfluorescein transport across the blood-retinal barrier was significantly reduced in the photocoagulated eyes (p less than 0.01). This transport activity was normalized in 14 days. Ten rabbits were intraperitoneally pretreated with 0.1 M/kg probenecid, a competitive inhibitor, which was likely to decrease active transport across the outer blood-retinal barrier. In probenecid-treated animals, argon laser photocoagulation did not affect the permeability of the blood-retinal barrier. The present study suggests that some beneficial effects of photocoagulation may be attributed to replacement of diseased retinal pigment epithelium by rapid growth of new pigment epithelial cells and reestablishment of active transport across the restored barrier.\r"

Despite limitation of ductions in MG, the group means of velocities of 10 deg saccades recorded with IR were similar in MG and normal subjects. With EOG, small but statistically significant decreases in mean velocities of 10, 20 and 30 deg saccades were found in MG, compared to those in normal subjects. Twenty-one to 28% of MG patients had velocities outside of the normal range (outliers). In contrast, the group means in CNP and PEO were markedly lower than those in MG and normal subjects. The frequencies of outliers were 89 to 100% in CNP and 88 to 100% in PEO. Measurement of saccadic velocities can be helpful in differentiating MG from other causes of ophthalmoplegia.\r"

Revision of two systems was necessitated by later surgery performed for unrelated problems. In the remaining nine primarily intubated systems, patency was maintained in long-term follow-up.

On examination, the edge of the implant was palpable at the most medial aspect of the inferior orbital rim in the anatomic area of the nasolacrimal sac. Orbital computed tomography (CT) scan and intraoperative probing and irrigation of the nasolacrimal system confirmed that the implant obstructed the nasolacrimal sac at the floor of the orbit. Removal of the implant combined with dacryocystorhinostomy has led to resolution of the dacryocystitis. To the authors' knowledge, dacryocystitis as a late complication of orbital floor fracture repair with an orbital floor implant has not been previously reported. This case demonstrates that orbital floor implants should not be placed too anteriorly or too medially in the anatomic region of the lacrimal sac and that they should be fixed to prevent implant migration.\r"

Accordingly, 127 patients with RMS confined to the region of the eyelid and orbit were treated by a variety of regimens characterized by initial partial tumor resection followed by concurrent multiagent chemotherapy and orbital radiation therapy. Recurrent tumor developed in ten patients. Seven relapsed initially in the orbit (of whom 4 were salvaged) and three in regional nodes.

  ".W": "A 49-year-old woman had a 12-year history of a localized left orbital tumor that required five subtotal excisions, orbital radiotherapy, and finally an exenteration. The last procedure was performed after visual function had deteriorated and in order to prevent spread of the tumor into a surrounding compartment. The biopsy specimens from the first four surgeries showed a stroma-free spindle cell tumor with benign cytologic features and no mitotic activity, which exhibited palisading of nuclei, imbrication of delicate cytoplasmic processes (neuropil), true perivascular rosettes with cytoplasmic processes oriented perpendicular to vessel walls, and Wright rosettes. The biopsy after radiotherapy and the exenteration specimen contained more polyhedral (gemistocytoid) tumor cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and tapering cell processes; nuclear pleomorphism without mitotic activity was also seen. Electron microscopy showed the presence of neurosecretory dense-core granules in the perikaryon region of the tumor cells and in the myriad interweaving cytoplasmic processes (neurites); neither Nissl substance nor synapses were identified. Immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase was positive, but glial fibrillary acidic protein stained negative. This previously undescribed orbital tumor is interpreted as a primary differentiated neuroblastoma without evidence of ganglion cell differentiation that exhibited locally aggressive behavior. The distinctions between neuroblastic and neuroendocrine tumors are discussed.\r"

Immunoperoxidase staining of the tissue was positive for IgG-kappa; no lambda chains were seen. Results of serum immunoelectrophoresis were positive for monoclonal IgG-kappa. Test results of the urine were positive for Bence Jones protein; only kappa chains were seen on radial diffusion. Systemic evaluation failed to show tumor elsewhere. The patient was treated with radiation and low-dose melphalan/prednisone, with good response. Five years later, the results of immunoelectrophoresis are normal and there is no clinical evidence of tumor; however, a small amount of kappa light chains remains in the urine. This case supports the important therapeutic and prognostic differences among orbital involvement in extramedullary plasmacytoma, solitary myeloma of bone, and multiple myeloma.\r"

As originally described, it consisted of the triad of the characteristic midline facial linear nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, seizures, and mental retardation. The authors have followed a patient with this syndrome from birth to age 8 and although he does demonstrate several neurologic and ocular abnormalities, he enjoys normal intelligence and has never suffered seizures. The features of this syndrome and several new ocular findings demonstrated in this case are described. Based on our long-term follow-up of this patient and our review of the reported cases to date, the authors suggest that the triad for this disorder should be changed to include the midline facial linear nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn, neurologic abnormalities which may, but not necessarily, include seizures and mental retardation, and ophthalmologic abnormalities.\r"

There is only one previous report of this unusual conjunctival neoplasm, which documented involvement of the plical, caruncular, or tarsal conjunctiva. The tumor grew by acanthosis of the surface nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium, with invagination into the underlying connective tissue in the absence of inflammation or a tendency toward keratinization. The initial invaginations may be cystic in character, but solid lobules secondarily originated from their walls to push into the connective tissue. Mucus-producing goblet cells were scattered throughout the lesions; highly distinctive eosinophilic globoid bodies, probably reflecting inspissated mucoid material, were found in the walls of the cysts and entrapped within their secretions. Conjunctival inverted papilloma does not exhibit locally aggressive behavior, does not involve extensive segments of the conjunctival epithelium, and does not display diffuse spread or multicentricity. The authors therefore believe that it should be clearly separated from inverted squamous (Schneiderian) papillomas of the nasal cavity and sinuses.\r"

The etiology is often a redundant or ectatic artery in the cerebellopontine angle that compresses the facial nerve. Neurosurgical decompression with implantation of a sponge between the ectatic artery and the facial nerve produces good results, but has a high complication rate and a poor patient acceptance rate. Various modes of peripheral neurectomy have also been advocated, but the recurrence rate is high and the preexisting functional and cosmetic eyelid deformities are exacerbated. The results of unilateral periorbital myectomy in 21 HFS patients are presented. Follow-up ranging from 1 to 7 years was available on 16 patients. Excellent or good results were obtained in 94% of these cases, and postoperative complications were minor. Transient lymphedema and forehead anesthesia are the most common complications. An unforseen benefit of periorbital myectomy surgery is the improvement or relief of lower facial contractions that occurred in 75% of patients. The authors believe the myectomy procedure is a safe, effective, predictable therapy for those HFS patients unwilling to risk a neurosurgical operation, and allows simultaneous reconstruction of associated eyelid and eyebrow deformities.\r"

The collaborative experience of six surgeons using pneumatic retinopexy for 100 cases is now reported. This series includes cases with pseudophakia, aphakia, macular detachment, macular breaks, vitreous hemorrhage, trauma, and old detachments. Initially, 91% were reattached, but seven recurrences yielded a 6-month follow-up cure rate of 84% with pneumatic retinopexy. With subsequent scleral buckling, 98% were reattached. Postoperative complications included proliferative vitreoretinopathy (3%), macular pucker (3%), and new/missed retinal breaks (7%). A review of the literature disclosed postoperative new/missed retinal breaks in nine series: 21, 3, 8, 4, 9, 7, 5, 4, and 13%. There were no cases of glaucoma, cataract, subretinal gas, endophthalmitis, or extension of the detachment into a previously attached macula. Pneumatic retinopexy offers the advantages of reduced tissue trauma, fewer complications, no hospitalization, and less expense. The major disadvantage is the need for postoperative positioning.\r"

Prospective studies are underway to assess its safety and efficacy. One potential complication of this technique is persistent detachment due to subretinal gas. We report seven cases of subretinal gas following attempted pneumatic retinal reattachment. In all cases, multiple fish-egg gas bubbles were present following injection; some of these bubbles gained access to the subretinal space during the early postoperative period. The subretinal gas gave the detached retina a pearly, dome-shaped, refractive sheen. Three cases were managed by positioning the patients' heads to allow the subretinal gas to pass through the retinal break back into the vitreous cavity. One case underwent successful scleral buckling that closed the retinal break despite the presence of a small subretinal gas bubble. Three cases required vitrectomy, air-fluid exchange, and cryotherapy or endolaser treatment. In five of the seven eyes the retina was eventually reattached successfully.\r"

Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells are an early and important component of these membranes. Contraction is mediated by cellular events and this contraction results in the formation of traction retinal detachments. Using the techniques of time-lapse cinemicrography, the authors studied the interaction of single RPE cells with individual strands of collagen. RPE cells pull the collagen fibers toward them using alternating extension and retraction of their lamellipodia. (The mechanism can be likened to sailors pulling in sheets of a sal in a hand-over-hand manner.) The collagen is not engulfed by the cell, but instead is piled up in a small bundle adjacent to the cell. Using this mechanism, each cell can reel in several times its length of collagen in 1 hour. In this manner, a small number of RPE cells may be able to collapse the vitreous gel and exert tractional forces.\r"

Between the intervals of 6 and 12 months, there was basic stability with two patients worsening in acuity, two patients improving, and 11 patients demonstrating no change.

Of 562 eyes treated over a 10-year period with pretreatment visual acuity of 20/200 or better, 363 (64.6%) contained tumors within 2 disc diameters (DD) of the disc or fovea. Rates of visual loss after treatment to worse than 20/200 and causes of visual decline were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cumulative rates of visual loss among subjects with tumors near the disc or fovea were 33 and 47% 1 and 2 years after treatment compared to 17 and 28%, respectively, for subjects with tumors located farther from both structures. The leading cause of visual loss in the first year among eyes with tumors near the disc or fovea was retinal detachment. Controlling for other predictors of visual loss to worse than 20/200, location near the disc or fovea was independently related to visual loss primarily due to retinal detachment, cataract, and radiation retinopathy. Despite the unfavorable location of these tumors, over half of patients with 20/200 or better pretreatment visual acuity had useful vision 2 years after treatment.\r"

Choroidal invasion was not significantly associated with a fatal outcome. Histologic evidence of a cataract, failure to diagnose retinoblastoma clinically, and bilaterality were also significant risk factors.

Of the eyes examined, 15.6% demonstrated at least one WCRH and 4.9% showed five or more WCRHs. The prevalence of WCRHs was not significantly related to hypertension, anemia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis, abnormalities of coagulation, increased serum creatinine, or ingestion of oral contraceptives. Local factors associated with microvascular damage and repair are likely responsible for WCRHs in diabetics. Microaneurysms are at the center of many diabetic WCRHs, and the pale centers of many WCRHs in diabetic retinopathy may be platelet-fibrin aggregates.\r"

The association with dermal vasculitis, nephropathy, meningo-encephalitis, cerebral vasculitis, and thyroiditis suggests that APMPPE may be one manifestation of a diffuse systemic inflammatory condition.\r"

Cultures of the vitreous grew Clostridium septicum, a gas-forming organism. Exploratory abdominal laparotomy showed a ruptured diverticulum of the sigmoid colon with acute peritonitis. In spite of intensive antibiotic therapy, the patient died approximately 24 hours after admission. Results of histopathologic examination of the postmortem left eye demonstrated massive necrosis of the intraocular structures with numerous gram-positive rods confined mainly to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), detached retina, and vitreous. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the second reported case of C. septicum panophthalmitis. Only 69 cases of clostridial infections with ocular involvement have been recorded previously in the literature.\r"

The following four different manifestations of a persistent hyaloid system were identified: hyaloid artery anastomosed to peripheral neovascularization (1 case); hyaloid artery present with attached retina (3 cases); fibrous-appearing stalk with detached retina (3 cases); and massive persistent hyaloid vascular system (7 cases). In some cases, the hyaloid artery was only an associated finding and unrelated to ROP. In other cases, the hyaloid artery appeared to be an integral component of the retrolental membrane. Recognition of a massive persistent hyaloid artery has important prognostic value because the vessels are adherent to the retina and the retrolental membrane complicating surgical repair. The role of the associated hyaloid artery in ROP is described.\r"

Both univariate and multivariate approaches to appraising success are evaluated. Psychological profiles demonstrated a substantial degree of disability at admissions, which is significantly reduced at follow-up. Both behavioral and cognitive aspects of performance, as evidenced by objective assessments of patients' physical abilities and verbalizations, improved as a direct function of length of stay in the treatment program and continued to show modest improvement through follow-up. Composite indices of improvement demonstrated favorable outcomes for no less than four in every ten, and as high as nine in every ten participants. Because of the large sample size, relationships both within and across measurement domains can be assessed statistically: the separate sets of outcome measures, with the exception of psychological profiles, are generally independent of each other.\r"

The results indicate that the chronic pain patients describe themselves retrospectively as more 'action-prone' than the patients of the two control groups. Using an analysis of covariance to have statistical control on age, occupational level and depression, the results were statistically significant on the 0.05 level. Although this study suggests that a strong tendency towards direct action may be a frequent and relatively specific premorbid feature of chronic pain patients, the pathogenic implications of these findings remain uncertain.\r"

Compared to a cohort of 147 patients admitted to the Midwest Regional Spinal Cord Injury Care System during the time period of the study, subjects were more likely to have paraplegia, incomplete sensory myelopathy, gunshot wounds to the spine and non-surgical spinal stabilization. Most patients described the pain as 'cutting,' 'burning,' 'piercing,' 'radiating' and 'tight.' The majority of patients located the pain internally and in the lower extremities. Values obtained from 6 McGill Pain Questionnaire subscales, 2 Sternbach Pain Intensity ratings and the Zung Pain and Distress index equalled or exceeded those reported for other pain syndromes. Use of these validated pain measures resulted in a systematic comprehensive assessment of function-limiting DPS following SCI.\r"

The results show that the patients with pain that persists beyond day 4 comprise a substantial proportion of the patients in a surgery ward (31%), are older, tend to use more words to describe their pain, and are helped less by their prescribed analgesic medications. This group is prescribed lower doses of analgesics and receives them more frequently; however, this prescription strategy appears to be ineffective since 26% of these patients report increased pain after medication compared to only 2% in the group that received analgesics during the first 4 days.\r"

Approximately 50% of the patients assessed in the hospital and 25% of the patients assessed in the out-patient clinic were found to be experiencing some degree of pain at the time of assessment. Therapy-related pain predominated in both in-patients and out-patients; only one-third of the pain experienced by in-patients and less than 20% of the pain experienced by out-patients was due to tumor. Tumor pain was due primarily to bony invasion. In order to control pain in those individuals experiencing pain, narcotic analgesics were being used by one-half of the in-patients and one-third of the out-patients. Overall pain control was good, with the medium visual analogue scale score being 26 mm on a 0-100 mm scale. During the study period 7 patients were identified to have chronic pain for greater than 1 year following eradication of all known tumor from the site of pain. One was receiving massive doses of narcotics (120 mg/day of methadone) apparently out of proportion to his underlying pain.\r"

Following the institution of cancer therapy, pain persisted for a median of 10 days. One patient died of malignancy after 5 months without resolution of her pain, and only 4 had persistent pain for greater than 9 months after the start of treatment. Persistent pain is an important symptom of cancer in children and young adults and is often present for long periods before the diagnosis of malignancy is made. Cancer in children usually responds rapidly to modern therapy, and pain usually persists only briefly after the initiation of treatment.\r"

Thereafter the incidence gradually increased and there were two outbreaks in 1983 and in 1985. In the period 1980 to 1985 pertussis was confirmed by culture or serology in 36,729 patients of which 11% were younger than 12 months of age and 69% were ages 1 to 6 years. An estimate of the total frequency of pertussis in preschool children was made from reports from a sample of the child health centers. The annual incidence rate per 100,000 population ages 0 to 6 years increased from the 700 cases in 1981 to 3200 in 1985. The ratio of total cases to those reported from the laboratories was 3:1 in 1981 and 2:1 in 1985. The cumulative incidence rate by the average age of 4 years was estimated at 16% of the unimmunized cohort born in 1980 compared with 5% of the immunized cohort born in 1978. The seriousness of pertussis was evaluated by studying the 2282 pertussis patients hospitalized from 1981 to the end of 1983. Forty-eight percent were infants younger than 12 months of age. Neurologic complications were noted in 4% and pneumonia in 14% of the hospitalized patients. Eleven children received assisted ventilation. Fatal outcomes were reported in 3 children (0.1%), 2 of whom had severe congenital disabilities.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine infants were identified as having coagulase-negative staphylococcal (C-S) bacteremia. Fourteen infants had pneumonia and 10 had central line-associated bacteremia. Twenty-four of 29 (83%) had invasion of the mucocutaneous barrier at the time the positive blood culture was drawn. Clinical signs and symptoms were nonspecific. Apnea/bradycardia was the most prevalent clinical feature, occurring in 20 (69%) infants. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent blood culture isolate, occurring in 21 (72%) cases. Slime production by C-S blood culture isolates occurred in 23 (79%) cases. There was no prevalent antibiotic resistance pattern, phage type or plasmid profile among blood culture isolates from infants with bacteremia. Mucocutaneous isolates of C-S from infants with bacteremia were compared with those from infants without invasive disease. Infants with bacteremia had a significantly higher percentage of slime-producing organisms (75% vs. 58%, P = 0.027) and a significantly higher percentage of S. epidermidis species (79% vs. 53%, P = 0.001) than isolates from infants without bacteremia. Our data support the relationship of slime production and the S. epidermidis species of C-S as virulence factors in infants with foreign bodies. Testing C-S for slime production is a relatively simple laboratory procedure which may be an additional aid in the evaluation of their clinical significance.\r"

Of 27 patients initially enrolled 25 received sufficient courses of aztreonam therapy to be evaluable. All patients received 200 mg/kg/day of aztreonam in 4 equally divided doses administered intravenously. Of 57 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from pretherapy sputum cultures, 48 were susceptible to aztreonam in vitro as were 11 of 18 strains isolated at the conclusion of therapy. With treatment colony counts of P. aeruginosa in sputum were reduced by 3 log10 or more in 15 patients. It was totally (but temporarily) eradicated in 11 of these patients. Clinical scores and white blood cell counts improved significantly (P less than 0.05). Side effects of aztreonam were limited to transient elevations of liver enzymes occurring in 16 patients. Aztreonam merits further evaluation in a randomized, comparative trial with standard antibiotic therapy for cystic fibrosis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of passive antibody on the incidence of influenza in infants, infants born to mothers with serum antibody to influenza A (immune) and those born to mothers without evidence for this serum antibody (non-immune) were followed during the influenza H1N1 epidemic of 1979. Immune mothers had higher H1-specific antibody titers before the epidemic (P less than 0.001), were less frequently culture positive, showed fewer titer rises (P less than 0.001) and were less symptomatic than were nonimmune mothers. Infants of immune mothers had higher H1-specific passive antibody titers that correlated with their mother's antibody titers. Although infants of both groups showed no difference in incidence of influenza infection, infants of immune mothers had influenza symptoms that were delayed in onset (P = 0.02) and were of shorter mean duration compared with infants of nonimmune mothers. These findings suggest that passive maternal antibody delays the onset and decreases the severity of influenza disease in young infants.\r"

As of December 31, 1985, 307 of these cases had been diagnosed in children younger than 13 years of age. The number of cases is increasing rapidly. The number of cases reported in 1985 more than doubled those reported in 1984. The major risk factors in children for acquiring infection with the causative agent, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), were having a mother known to be infected and/or at increased risk for infection and receiving a transfusion of blood or blood products. Of the 307 children with AIDS, 73% were reported from one of four states: New York, New Jersey, Florida, and California. Most AIDS cases in children occur in black or Hispanic infants and toddlers. The estimated incubation period for AIDS in children has increased each surveillance year, with the longest incubation exceeding 7 years. The prognosis for children with AIDS is poor and infants less than 1 year of age have the shortest survival time following diagnosis. Continued national surveillance for AIDS is mandatory for establishing effective prevention programs to control the spread of the disease. The CDC encourages all health care personnel to report cases of AIDS to their public health departments.\r"

A national mail survey of 2,000 pediatricians was designed to determine the attitudes, current practices, and knowledge among primary care pediatricians regarding these risks. The response rate was 60% (779 primary care pediatricians). Responses indicated that a majority of pediatricians take a family history of cardiovascular diseases, assess BP, recommend exercise to school-aged children, and advise patients and parents against smoking. Few pediatricians felt confident in their ability to affect change in patient life-styles. There was a relatively low level of provision of dietary advice, and most pediatricians do not measure serum cholesterol levels, except in high-risk older children. A substantial minority do not discuss smoking, even with adolescents. Practices and attitudes varied with the age of the patient. Obesity was the topic most frequently chosen for continuing medical education. Older pediatricians were most likely to advocate and practice risk reduction in children. Attitudes and reported practices also varied by gender and geographic location of the pediatrician as well as the ethnic composition of the practice. Implications for continuing medical education are discussed.\r"

A negative dose-response relationship was demonstrated between use of the formula without additional nutritional supplementation and cognitive outcome as measured by the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (Pearson r = -.55, P = .01) at 2 years of age. A similar negative relationship was demonstrated between this exclusive use of the defective formula and perceptual (Pearson r = -.51, P less than .05), motor (Pearson r = -.52, P less than .05), and fine motor (Pearson r = -.75, P less than .002) ability as measured by the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities at 4 years of age. When other know predictors of developmental outcome were taken into account by means of multiple linear regression analyses, exclusive formula use emerged as an important predictor of the children's cognitive functioning at 2 years (model R2 = .59, P less than .005) and of quantitative (model R2 = .58, P less than .006), perceptual (model R2 = .63, P less than .009), and fine motor ability (model R2 = .74, P less than .003) at 4 years of age.

Additionally, analysis of physician mentions of aspiring and acetaminophen for treating flu and chickenpox showed statistically significant trends toward decreasing recommendations for the use of aspirin and significant trends toward increasing recommendations for use of acetaminophen. Trends in wholesale purchases of aspirin and acetaminophen by drug stores from 1979 through 1985 demonstrated a significant decline for the 81-mg children's aspirin tablet and an increase in purchases of children's acetaminophen products. Many factors may influence physician and parents' choice of analgesic/antipyretic medication, including information about Reye syndrome. Data suggest that a continuing decline in the use of aspirin for children may be accompanied by a continuing decline in the reported number of Reye syndrome cases.\r"

Hemorrhages are hypothesized to result from rapid fluctuations in cerebral perfusion pressure and/or cerebral blood flow. Phenobarbital sodium has been given to premature infants in anticonvulsant dosages in attempts to prevent hemorrhages, but its efficacy in clinical studies has been disputed. In this study, in the 24 to 72-hour-old newborn beagle, an animal model for periventricular and intraventricular intracerebral hemorrhage, phenobarbital sodium was administered to obtain anticonvulsant serum levels prior to phenylephrine-induced hypertensive insult. None of the animals was hypoxic or hypercarbic. Resulting hypertensive systemic mean arterial BPs were 99 +/- 8 mm Hg in the 15 control pups and 93 +/- 15 mm Hg in the 15 phenobarbital sodium-treated pups (not statistically significantly different). The duration of the hypertension was the same in both groups. Phenobarbital caused a significant decrease in mean arterial BP in the treated group just after its administration (P less than .05). Six of the 15 control pups (40%) and one of the 15 treated pups (7%) demonstrated macroscopic and microscopic periventricular and intraventricular hemorrhage (P less than .05, chi 2, Yates correction). Thus, in nonasphyxiated newborn beagles, phenobarbital sodium significantly reduced the incidence of hemorrhage after hypertensive insult.\r"

  ".W": "Indirect BPs measured by the Dinamap monitor, an oscillometric device, and the conventional auscultatory method were compared with the direct radial artery pressure in infants and children. There were 29 patients in the Dinamap group with a median age of 18 months (ranges 1 month to 16 years) and 20 patients in the auscultatory group with a median age of 3.5 years (ranges 3 months to 16 years). The direct radial artery pressures were recorded on a strip chart and the ranges of pressures were obtained for systolic, diastolic, and mean pressures. The range of the direct readings was converted to a weighted single reading, and comparisons were made between the direct and indirect readings. The linear regression equation between the direct (x) and the Dinamap (y) readings (with correlation coefficient) was y = 1.05x - 5.36 (r = .97) for systolic, y = 1.10x - 4.65 (r = .903) for diastolic, and y = 1.06x - 4.21 (r = .917) for mean pressures. The linear regression equation (with correlation coefficient) for the auscultatory pressure was y = 1.60x - 68.23 (r = .872) and y = 1.38x - 16.47 (r = .874) for diastolic pressures. The error was defined as the indirect reading minus the direct reading. The mean error +/- SD was -0.24 +/- 3.26 for systolic, 1.28 +/- 4.74 for diastolic, and 0.10 +/- 4.56 mm Hg for mean pressures by the Dinamap method. It was -1.65 +/- 6.68 for systolic, and 8.70 +/- 5.97 for diastolic pressures by the auscultatory method.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Preliminary reports have demonstrated the success of high-frequency ventilation in the treatment of pulmonary interstitial emphysema. In a previous investigation, we were able to develop a formula for predicting death in infants weighing less than 1,500 g with pulmonary interstitial emphysema. Using this subgroup of severely affected infants, we studied the efficacy of high-frequency ventilation in nine infants. Using the Volumetric Diffusive Respirator, we observed improvement in all respiratory values measured (pH, PCO2, and PO2), a significantly decreased mean airway pressure (MAP), and improvement in neonatal mortality. Complications of severe bleeding diatheses, hypotension, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing tracheobronchitis were observed. Our investigation was the first to systematically choose infants who might benefit from high-frequency ventilation and to compare them with similar infants with known outcomes. We realize that the study was rescue in nature using historical controls, but we felt compelled to assure the safety of the device before randomizing less sick infants. High-frequency ventilation appears to be effective in the acute management of low birth weight infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema.\r"

Endrin was detected in the blood of 12 of 18 patients with a history of convulsions but was not found in the blood of four hospitalized control patients. One composite sugar sample taken from the homes of three persons had an endrin level of 0.04 ppm. Because of the high toxicity, repeated association with large-scale outbreaks of neurologic illness, and the difficulties of monitoring distribution, endrin should not be used for agricultural purposes.\r"

The median urine mercury level of 23 workers' children was 25 micrograms/L. This was significantly higher than the level (5 micrograms/L) among 39 children randomly selected from nonworkers' households in the same community (P less than .001). Mercury-in-air levels measured in workers' homes were higher than those measured in control homes. A significant correlation was found between the urine mercury levels of the workers' children and the urine mercury levels of their working parents. No child had frank mercury toxicity. No evidence of neurologic toxicity among exposed children was discovered by a pediatric neurologist who examined these and unexposed children without knowledge of their exposure status. This is the first report demonstrating mercury exposure in children of mercury workers. Although toxic effects of mercury were not demonstrated at these levels of exposure, children of mercury workers are at risk for mercury exposure and potential mercury toxicity.\r"

The clinical manifestations of the disease, profound psychomotor retardation and visual impairment, appear during the first year of life. Definitive diagnosis is made by electron microscopy which reveals storage organelles typical of the mucolipidoses. This study details, for the first time, the heterogeneity of the ophthalmologic features, specifically as pertains to the age of onset, degree and clinical course of the corneal opacities, and the retinal involvement. Although the top developmental level was found to be 12 to 15 months in language and motor function, the course of the disease is protracted for some children, who show only a slight improvement, and others, little if any deterioration despite the early infantile onset of the disease. This presentation provides guidelines for the clinical diagnosis of mucolipidosis type IV.\r"

The Bayley Scales of Infant Development were administered before and both 1 week and 3 months after IM or oral administration of iron. Appropriate placebo-treated control infants were also tested. Infants with iron deficiency anemia showed significantly lower mental and motor test scores, even after considering factors relating to birth, nutrition, family background, parental IQ, and the home environment. After 1 week, neither IM nor oral iron treatments differed from placebo treatment in effects on scores. After 3 months, lower mental and motor test scores were no longer observed among iron-deficient anemic infants whose anemia and iron deficiency were both corrected (36%). However, significantly lower mental and motor test scores persisted among the majority of initially anemic infants (64%) who had more severe or chronic iron deficiency. Although no longer anemic, they still showed biochemical evidence of iron deficiency after 3 months of treatment. These persistent lower scores suggest either that iron therapy adequate for correcting anemia is insufficient to reverse behavioral and developmental disturbances in many infants or that certain ill effects are long-lasting, depending on the timing, severity, or chronicity of iron deficiency anemia in infancy.\r"

Before assessment, 39 children (average age 11 years, 20 girls) and their parents completed standard anxiety, personality, and life events scales. The same scales were administered to the control children and their parents. All subjects met Prensky's criteria for migraine, and all reviewed an audiovisual program on migraine and were given the same instruction about analgesic medications. History of headache averaged 35 months (1 to 132 months). No statistically significant differences were found between patients and controls or between the two groups of parents on any of the anxiety or life events scales. Children's anxiety scores were not related to parents' anxiety scores. Personality profiles of patients were similar to controls. Headache diaries were used to assess headache severity and frequency during a 4-month follow-up period. Although all patients had anxiety scores within the normal range, those with higher self-rated anxiety scores at initial assessment had significantly more frequent and severe headaches during the follow-up period (P less than .001). We conclude that children with migraines are not more anxious or stressed than their friends. Normal amounts of stress and anxiety appear to lead to the expression of migraine; however, more anxious children with migraines have more frequent and severe headaches.\r"

The physician evaluating a patient who happens to have a history of headaches may naturally consider them as part of the disease when formulating a diagnosis, thus attributing undue significance to ordinary functional headaches. This may account for the myths that unruptured aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations cause headache and that migraine can eventually lead to stroke. Sometimes, however, headaches do warn of cerebrovascular disease or occur as part of that disease. The presence of headache may aid in or hinder diagnosis. Clues that a headache may indicate cerebrovascular disease are onset after the age of 35; pain described as \"the worst headache ever\"; persistent localization and progressive worsening of pain; and risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, such as advancing age, hypertension, bruits, and heart disease.\r"

Arrhythmias can be categorized as to their potential for causing sudden cardiac death as benign, potentially malignant, or malignant by considering their type and the underlying structural cardiac disease present. Factors that may aggravate the arrhythmias should be identified and corrected. The ventricular arrhythmias should be well characterized using ambulatory monitoring or electrophysiologic studies to gauge the efficacy of subsequent therapy. If pharmacologic therapy is to be initiated, the most appropriate antiarrhythmic drug should be chosen with consideration of potential efficacy, potential adverse cardiovascular and systemic side effects, pharmacokinetics, and drug interactions. In selected patients with malignant ventricular arrhythmias, the failure of antiarrhythmic medication may lead the clinician to consider nonpharmacologic therapy such as surgical endocardial resection or the automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\r"

The decrease in self-esteem triggers anxiety, which may be so severe as to approach a panic state. The patient then becomes increasingly disabled or has increasing physical symptoms and enters a vicious cycle culminating in debility.

Anorectic patients who have normal electrolyte values do not have a significant incidence of ventricular ectopy at rest or with exercise, and they maintain sinus rhythm, although ECGs of adolescent females are abnormal. Our patients had a reduction of their total body weight, percent fat, and fat-free (lean) body mass, as well as a significant reduction in myocardial mass. Heart rate and blood pressure response to exercise were blunted, and oxygen consumption and total work performance were reduced. Hemodynamic studies generally showed a lowered cardiac index, most likely secondary to the small size of the heart and the reduction in stroke volume. In addition, preliminary data suggest that diastolic compliance is abnormal in these patients. Long-term follow-up of the cardiovascular status of all patients with anorexia nervosa patients is necessary to see if cardiac abnormalities demonstrated before treatment disappear after weight gain and resumption of normal activities. Cardiac function should be carefully evaluated, because the reduced exercise performance in these patients may be secondary to cardiac dysfunction as well as to the loss of peripheral muscle mass. Bulimic patients also need to be watched closely, particularly those whose potassium level is less than 3 mEq.\r"

The reliability coefficients ranged from .62 to .85 for the individual sites and from .79 to .91 for the sums of the three measurements and for the estimates of the percentage of body fat.

One hundred twelve (66.3%) responses were received and analyzed. Demographic characteristics of the respondents are reported. The results of the study showed that ACCEs, in general, expressed low levels of occupational dissatisfaction and burnout. Satisfaction with the aspects of the job involving self-esteem, achievement, and creativity seems to outweight dissatisfaction with the time available, the work load, and organizational efficiency. Those ACCEs with doctoral degrees expressed the highest levels of dissatisfaction and burnout. Those ACCEs working in entry-level master's degree programs expressed the lowest level of dissatisfaction; those in tenure-track positions expressed the lowest level of burnout.

  ".W": "This study attempts to define the effect of early repair and breast-feeding on the outcome of cleft lip surgery. The first part deals with 100 consecutive cleft lip repairs categorized retrospectively by age at operation. Forty-nine patients were operated on during the first 3 weeks of life; 51 at an older age. There were no statistically significant differences in complication rate between the groups (14 and 18 percent, respectively). A subgroup of 26 infants was operated on at a week or less of age; these sustained significantly fewer complications (8 percent). There was no apparent difference in the operative results as defined by whether or not the child needed a subsequent revision. A second group of 60 mothers was offered the choice of breast-feeding their babies immediately following operation. Sixteen breast-fed for a minimum of 6 weeks, 22 were fed by means of a cup or syringe, and 22 started breast-feeding but converted to a bottle within 6 weeks. No complications attributable to breastfeeding were observed, and the rate of weight gain was definitely enhanced in the breast-feeding group. Hospital stay was shortened by an average of over a day (33 percent) as compared with those fed by cup. This effect was related to the easier transition from IV administration to oral intake when breast-fed. We are currently encouraging early repair and breast-feeding in the full-term baby as the optimum method of management of newborns with cleft lip.\r"

Although the pushback operation using a mucoperiosteal flap is a readily effective method for velopharyngeal closure, postoperative fistula sometimes occurs, especially when the cleft palate is wide. Furthermore, postoperative maxillary deformity, possibly due to elevating the mucoperiosteal palatal flap, is extremely troublesome. For the purpose of pushing back the nasal mucosa, we applied the Kaplan buccal flap method, which is also applicable for reestablishing the levator muscle sling. The other buccal flap is covered on the hinged flap of the pared cleft margins. This results in far less disturbance of maxillary growth. We call it the T-shaped buccal flap method, and we have applied it in over 30 patients with various cleft palates and have obtained satisfactory results.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue expansion has been extremely valuable in the treatment of traumatic scalp defects. We have recently used expansion techniques in the treatment of male pattern baldness. Expansion has been used in conjunction with scalp-reduction procedures and pedicled hair-bearing flaps. Flaps have been designed as Juri flaps, and in one patient, a new posteriorly based flap was used. This design gives the advantage of a more natural-appearing hairline and forward-growing hair. The major advantage of tissue expansion in the treatment of male pattern baldness is that it generates new hair-bearing scalp. The increase in vascularity which occurs during expansion allows for large, safe, and predictable flaps. Donor sites are also relatively easily closed. The disadvantages of expansion include the need for two or more surgical procedures and multiple office visits. There is also some discomfort following expansion and a cosmetic defect as the expanders become larger. Complications include infection, exposure or extrusion, deflation, and hair loss. Tissue expansion combined with scalp reduction and pedicled hair-bearing flaps have proved to be a valuable technique in the treatment of male pattern baldness with a high degree of patient satisfaction.\r"

  ".W": "The nasolabial flap remains the favored technique for alar and lateral nasal reconstruction. Results with currently popular techniques tend to be inartistic and aesthetically disappointing. Improved results can be achieved, however, by a technique using a medially based nasolabial turnover flap for lining with a distal extension providing the cover. Reconstruction of the ala begins by designing a nasolabial flap with its base as close as possible to the site of the proposed ala. The flap is incised to the required margins, carrying 2 to 3 mm of underlying fat; then, hinged on its base, the flap is flipped over medially like the page of a book. As the proximal flap is sutured to the lining side of the defect, the distal flap gracefully twists 90 degrees and is then folded on itself to form the external surface of the ala. The donor site is closed primarily. With this procedure, a natural-appearing and appropriately positioned ala may be reconstructed in one step, although a second procedure may be helpful to sculpture the margin or precisely position the alar base.\r"

In patients undergoing augmentation mammaplasty, recontouring or sculpturing of these abnormal costal cartilages may correct or improve the underlying chest-wall deformity and thus enhance the final aesthetic result. This method has had application in mild to moderate asymmetrical cases of both pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum, thoracic hypoplasia (Poland's syndrome), isolated cartilage deformities, and spinal scoliosis. In our hands, the combination of cartilage sculpturing with submuscular augmentation mammaplasty is performed as an outpatient local anesthetic procedure requiring not more than 90 minutes.\r"

  ".W": "Objective measurement of impairment after burns is important to patients, physicians, lawyers, and insurance companies. Even so, we could not find any references in the English literature describing how to objectively rate the physical impairment of burn survivors. The American Medical Association (AMA) has published the book Guides to Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, which is commonly used by surgeons to rate injuries. We decided to use this document to rate the impairment of burn patients. We studied patients who were treated at the University of Washington Burn Center during the years 1981, 1982, and 1983; survived the injury; were hospitalized 5 or more days or were skin grafted; and were followed until their condition was fixed (usually 12 months). This group included 325 patients. The mean age was 28.2 years and the mean total body surface area burned (TBSA) was 11.6 percent. We measured whole-man impairment (WMI) as described by the Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. The mean whole-man impairment was 7.7 percent. In addition, we recorded time off from work and out of school after burns. The average time off from work was 12.7 weeks, and the average time out of school was 8.5 weeks. We conclude that the AMA publication can be used to rate burn patients and that the whole-man impairment of burn survivors is quite low if amputation, loss of range of motion, and nerve damage can be prevented.\r"

Eight 21-day-old rabbits completed the study in which perichondrium was elevated from one cartilaginous surface of one ear and the nonoperated ear served as a control. By maturity, both ears had developed symmetrically and no statistically significant difference could be demonstrated in length and surface area. Although several ears demonstrated subtle shape changes, the overall growth and development of the surgically manipulated ear cartilages did not appear to be affected. These findings appear to contradict a widely held view that perichondrial dissection of developing cartilage has a high potential for subsequent growth disturbances. The corollary has been that cartilage manipulation, such as that required in the surgical repair of the cleft lip nose deformity, should be delayed until the growth of cartilage is complete. These data would support the findings of long-term clinical studies which demonstrate the efficacy of early limited perichondrial dissection in the correction of the cleft lip nose deformity.\r"

The medial cortex of the devascularized tibia was covered with skin in one experimental group (n = 7) and a local muscle flap in the other (n = 6). The animals were given intravenous fluorochrome dye and killed 42 days postoperatively. Enveloping callus formed around the cortex which was repaired by the formation of resorptive cavities on its external surface. New bone formation occurred within the resorptive cavities. Muscle flap coverage was associated with a sixfold increase in cortical porosity (p less than 0.005) and a fourfold increase in the area of enveloping callus (p less than 0.05). The area of intracortical new bone formation was greater in the cortex with muscle flap coverage (p less than 0.05). The maximum depth of intracortical new bone formation increased from 0.46 +/- 0.14 mm with skin coverage to 0.95 +/- 0.14 mm with muscle flap coverage (p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that muscle flaps are superior to skin coverage in initiating the repair of devascularized cortical bone.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) produces a cross-sectional tomographic image at higher resolution than conventional CAT scans and provides a dynamic and physiologic assessment of transferred tissue. We first studied ischemic muscle in the beagle hindlimb gracilis muscles and found an incremental and definitive increase in signal strength both over time and in comparing complete devascularization to partial devascularization. In the right hindlimb (partially devascularized), there was an average increase in T2 (measured in milliseconds) of 2.5 percent at 1 hour, 16.72 percent at 3 hours, and 16.45 percent at 12 hours as compared to normal undisturbed muscle. Similarly, the left hindlimb (completely devascularized) measurements increased from 10.97 percent at 1 hour to 24.02 percent at 3 hours to 47.75 percent at 12 hours. Possible explanations for T2 increases include an increase in intercellular and intracellular water, a change in pH, and possible protein metabolism changes. Clinical studies in seven patients with free flaps have shown \"normal\" T2 values in healthy tissue comparable to undisturbed canine gracilis muscle and the change in contour and composition of tissue over time. The clinical usefulness of these data is apparent.\r"

A pneumothorax rate consistent with our average rate for CT-guided biopsies (25%) was obtained, and only one patient required chest tube placement. In this series, CT-guided biopsies of hilar masses were more consistently successful in obtaining tissue for diagnosis than were bronchoscopic biopsies.

Most patients were young adults. Findings of pulmonary tuberculosis were seen on plain radiographs in 14 patients. On CT, findings were of an overwhelming preponderance of involvement of the right paratracheal and tracheobronchial nodes. After injection of contrast medium, nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter invariably showed central areas of relative low density and peripheral rim enhancement. Enhanced walls were usually irregular in thickness. Some smaller nodes did not show low-density areas, but instead showed varying degrees of homogeneous enhancement. Although metastatic nodes can be of low density, experience in this study suggests that mediastinal lymphadenopathy in a young adult with the CT findings described above is characteristic enough to support a diagnosis of tuberculosis.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the acute and long-term effects on the vasa vasorum after massive overdilation, canine aortic segments were dilated with Gruentzig balloon catheters to more than 100% over normal size. In the acute study, the significant lumen increase was the result of intimal and medial rupture with stretching and thinning of the adventitia. In these areas, the vasa vasorum were stretched and severed, causing adventitial hemorrhage. In the chronic study, areas of previous subtotal wall rupture with adventitial thinning were repaired by scar tissue. This repair included formation of a neomedia, hyperplasia of the adventitia, and proliferation of the vasa vasorum. No progression of luminal dilatation was seen. This study showed that in subtotal aortic wall rupture, even a severely damaged adventitia is capable of preserving the lumen from further dilatation and rupture until healing. Blood flow to the damaged vessel wall was reestablished by revascularization via capillary budding in the aortic wall.\r"

In 674 (94.0%), testicular (internal spermatic) vein insufficiency was proved by contrast medium reflux from the left renal vein into the testicular vein, down to the pampiniform plexus. The different venographic patterns of the testicular veins were classified into seven basic types. Five of these, comprising 624 patients, had incompetent or missing valves all along the trunk of the testicular vein. In 554 of the 624 (88.8%), sclerotherapy was performed, but such treatment was possible in only three of 50 patients with a competent orifice valve bypassed by an insufficient collateral (type IVb). In 43 of the 717 patients (6.0%), no insufficient vein could be found at all (type 0). The mean fluoroscopy time was 4.4 minutes. There were no serious complications associated with venography or sclerotherapy, and the initial recurrence rate was 9.8%. Percutaneous sclerotherapy is therefore a simple, safe, and effective treatment of testicular vein insufficiency and is suitable for almost 80% of patients with varicoceles.\r"

  ".W": "The author's experience with 72 patients with impotence, one patient with Peyronie disease (no impotence), and two healthy volunteers indicates that incompetence of the venocclusive mechanism of the corpora cavernosa is probably the most common cause of vasculogenic impotence. Manometric and angiographic studies are the key to diagnosis but only when performed while the venocclusive mechanism is activated. Activation is achieved by intracavernosal injection of a papaverine-phentolamine mixture. Pharmacomanometry, performed with the newly developed pharmacologic maintenance erectile flow (PMEF) method, enabled precise quantitation of the leak at a given cavernosal pressure. A new appreciation of the limited volume of normal flow in the cavernosal arteries indicates that cavernosal leak in the range of only 20 ml/min is probably capable of contributing to impotence. Pharmacocavernosography enabled identification of sites of leakage (key information in the planning of surgical correction) but was unreliable in the evaluation of the severity of leakage.\r"

After papaverine injection, erections and/or higher pressures occurred at lower flow rates in all the men. The venous drainage of the corpora decreased or disappeared in most subjects while the corpora became larger and contained more contrast material. The findings suggest that an active venous obstructive mechanism is important during erection, can be induced by the administration of papaverine, and should be evaluated in impotent men.\r"

Systematic noise was the dominant factor degrading abdominal magnetic resonance (MR) images. Signal averaging was the primary determinant of both statistical and systematic image noise, fitting a power function (n)b with b = 0.44 and -0.42, respectively, close to the expected b = -0.5 power function. All types of ghosting showed the same sensitivity to signal averaging. Normalized systematic noise increased slightly with TR (b = 0.16) and increased markedly with TE (b = 0.40). These data indicate that the short TR, short TE technique is a powerful method for reducing motion artifacts on breathhold images and can be combined with signal averaging to further suppress artifacts, improve signal-to-noise ratio, and maximize anatomic resolution.\r"

Such measurements are essential for acceptance testing and quality control purposes over reasonably long volumes. The details of this new phantom are described, and results of its use with both low-and high-field-strength MR imaging systems are presented.\r"

CT scans clearly depicted the tumors and metastases in relation to surrounding vital structures but did not provide findings specific for carcinoids. The appearance on CT of an abdominal soft-tissue mass with a radiating pattern of linear densities was found to be highly suggestive of intestinal carcinoid tumors. I-131 MIBG scintiscans disclosed intense tracer uptake in the tumors and metastases in five patients. MIBG studies correctly depicted nine of nine tumor manifestations in intestinal carcinoids and four of six tumor manifestations in bronchus carcinoids. No MIBG concentration was found in thymus carcinoids. Because of its selective uptake mechanism, I-131 MIBG scintigraphy can allow specific detection and localization of neuroendocrine tumor tissue in patients with suspected carcinoid tumors. MIBG scintigraphy has diagnostic potential as a screening procedure in carcinoid tumors, especially those of intestinal origin.\r"

Age, sex, symptoms, serum alkaline phosphatase level, and histologic and radiographic appearance of the lesions were evaluated. Patients were young at clinical presentation, averaging 36 years of age. In five of six patients the serum alkaline phosphatase level was normal. The proximal extent of the disease was the anterior tibial tubercle rather than the proximal epiphysis. Radiographic patterns ranged from predominantly lytic to mixed lytic and blastic to predominantly blastic, and the lesion was marginated by a flame-shaped configuration. The radiographic appearance of Paget disease of the anterior tibial tubercle is characteristic and should be sufficient to suggest the diagnosis and preclude biopsy.\r"

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that oblique radiography was most accurate (55% sensitivity, 69% specificity) in distinguishing the presence from the absence of disease; in distinguishing absent or mild from moderate or severe disease, the specificity of oblique radiography was higher, at 94%, but its sensitivity was much lower, at 23%.

Both 5-mm and 10-mm contiguous section sequences afforded greater sample volumes, mean mineral equivalent values, and precision than did the single midplane section technique. These findings can be explained by inhomogeneous trabecular distribution, differential bone resorption rates for various cancellous regions, and nonuniform deposition of marrow fat. Scoliosis may modify the net influence of these factors owing to altered biomechanical forces. Although the single-section method affords optimal sensitivity to early or subtle alterations in vertebral trabecular bone density, it may misrepresent the status of the total cancellous volume. Because three-dimensional histographic analysis includes structurally important peripheral trabeculae in determinations of mean mineral equivalent values, it may more accurately reflect vertebral body strength and risk of compression fracture.\r"

If a high-signal-intensity lesion was seen after a patient had undergone only surgery, the patient had active tumor (six of six such cases).

  ".W": "Postoperative radiation therapy for lung cancer is still controversial. In a 9-year period, 69 patients with non-oat-cell carcinoma of the lung (16% stage I, 26% stage II, and 58% stage III) received such therapy. The radiation dose was less than 5,000 cGy in 42 patients, 5,000-5,900 cGy in 16, and 6,000 cGy or more in 11; follow-up ranged from 24 to 64 months. Actuarial survival at 2 and 4 years was 50% and 16%, respectively, for squamous cell carcinoma, and 40% and 26% for adenocarcinoma. The 5-year survival for stages I, II, and III cancer was 29%, 17%, and 19%, respectively. Histologic findings and type of surgery did not affect survival, but the radiation dose apparently did. The 3-year survival for patients who received less than 6,000 cGy was 35%, compared with 73% for patients who received higher doses. In eight patients, treatment failed within the irradiated volume: all had received doses of less than 6,000 cGy, and the volume in three was judged to be inadequate.\r"

Between 1975 and 1984, 29 highly selected patients received paraaortic irradiation as part of their definitive treatment for cervical carcinoma. Paraaortic fields were irradiated to a total dose of 4,200-5,000 rad (42-50 Gy), in fractions of 150-180 rad (1.5-1.8 Gy). An anteroposterior-posteroanterior technique was generally used. All fields were treated every day. There were no instances of small-bowel obstruction or other major complications, surgical procedures, or deaths caused by paraaortic irradiation. Eleven patients (38%) have no evidence of recurrent disease 23-120 months after completion of therapy. Paraaortic irradiation was well tolerated in this patient group without prior staging lymphadenectomy. Thus, in selected patients and with appropriate techniques, paraaortic irradiation for cervical carcinoma may be used with relative safety.\r"

Sixteen of the 72 tumors showed complete regression. Tumor regression was not related to the average maximum or minimum tumor temperature. CT scans obtained after thermoradiation therapy demonstrated a clear low-density area in 32 of 56 tumors that did not regress completely. Histopathologic examinations, performed in 14 of the 32 tumors, showed the low-density area to be massive coagulation necrosis. The low-density area was classified into three types according to its percentage area in the tumor: type 3 (more than 80%), type 2 (50%-80%), and type 1 (less than 50%). The type correlated with the average maximum and minimum tumor temperature, and follow-up observations and histopathologic examinations showed great effects in most of the type 3 tumors.\r"

Most of these cases involved failure to diagnose lung carcinomas on chest radiographs and failure to diagnose colon carcinomas on barium enema studies.

Although flow rates with other combinations of catheter length, contrast material, and injection pressure cannot be predicted from these results, heating of contrast material is probably most useful when a high-viscosity contrast medium is used in a small catheter.\r"

Uniform marking of the small bowel remains the greatest challenge. Ferrites are magnetically active iron oxide particles that are miscible with water and cause loss of signal on MR images. The decrease in MR signal intensity produced by ferrites occurs with a wide range of iron concentrations (0.1-10 mM) and with both T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences. These effects of ferrites are explained by predominant T2 shortening with negligible T1 effects. The ferrite preparation used in this study was stable in vitro, with little iron solubilized by acid. Intragastric administration of ferrite (5 mg of iron per kg in 6 ml) routinely marked the small bowel of rats. The authors conclude that ferrites represent a promising new class of contrast agents for gastrointestinal MR imaging.\r"

The latter findings consisted of an extrinsic impression on the superior or inferior aspect of the sigmoid colon with associated thumbprinting or spiculation. In each patient serosal inflammation of the sigmoid colon produced by an adherent segment of the ischemic small intestine was confirmed at laparotomy. In two patients, delay in surgical intervention resulted in small intestine necrosis. In a patient who has clinical signs and symptoms of colonic ischemia, diverticulitis, or small intestine obstruction but nonspecific findings on barium studies, the diagnosis of small intestine ischemia should be considered and further diagnostic imaging, such as angiography or small intestine follow-through examination, should be performed.\r"

MR imaging correctly delineated the position of the disk in 11 (73%) joints and incorrectly delineated it in four (27%) joints. Disk configuration was depicted accurately in nine (60%) joints, inaccurately in five (33%), and was not visible in one (7%). Errors observed with sagittal MR images were correlated with mediolateral alterations of disk position. These abnormalities were depicted in coronal images, however. Osseous anatomy was correctly assessed in nine joints (60%). MR imaging demonstrated the margin between the disk and its attachments, which is not possible by arthrography. MR imaging is an acceptable alternative to other imaging modalities for assessing soft and hard tissues of the TMJ.\r"

A side-by-side comparison of the two types of arthrograms, however, revealed that video tape recording of lower-space, single-contrast arthrography was superior in demonstrating joint dynamics and that dual-space, double-contrast arthrotomography was superior in demonstrating the soft-tissue anatomic features of the joint. It appears that lower-space, single-contrast arthrography can be recommended for examination of patients with clicking, catching, and intermittent locking, and that dual-space, double-contrast arthrotomography is preferable when information about morphologic alterations is clinically more important than information about joint dynamics.\r"

Type 3 had no meniscuslike connective tissue extending into the joint. Type 4 had irregular, thick masses of collagen, fat, and cartilage in the periphery of the joint space. Menisci in the child were predominantly type 1. In adults type 2 menisci predominated at C1-2 and type 3 in the lower cervical facet joints. The few type 4 menisci found were in association with facet joint degeneration. Types 2 and 4 menisci could be demonstrated with MR imaging. In MR images the collagenous portion of the menisci were of low signal intensity, and the fat was of higher signal intensity. Few menisci conform to the traditional anatomic description.\r"

Fifty-six patients with benign, probably benign, or probably malignant ulcers underwent endoscopy and biopsy. All 56 had benign ulcers. Another three patients with unequivocally malignant ulcers had endoscopically proved carcinomas. Thus, most suspicious ulcers were benign, but no benign-appearing ulcers were malignant. Follow-up double-contrast studies for 87 ulcers revealed complete ulcer healing in 68 (78%). A residual ulcer scar was observed in 61 of those 68 cases (90%). This experience suggests that double-contrast radiography is a valuable technique for diagnosing benign gastric ulcers and that once diagnosed, typically benign ulcers can be followed up radiographically until completely healed, without need for endoscopic intervention.\r"

The clinical and radiologic records of 48 patients with suspected vagus nerve dysfunction were reviewed to derive an efficient and effective approach to imaging this patient population. An imaging algorithm is proposed in which vagal neuropathies are divided both clinically and radiologically into proximal and distal categories. Proximal vagal lesions are part of a cranial neuropathy complex and have associated oropharyngeal signs and symptoms (e.g., abnormal gag reflex, uvular deviation). Distal vagal lesions occur as an isolated paralysis of the vagus nerve with no symptoms or signs referable to the oropharynx. Either computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging can be used to diagnose proximal or distal lesions. However, CT will be insensitive in the detection of the more cephalic proximal lesions, especially those in the brain stem, basal cisterns, and skull base.\r"

As in other series, Staphylococcus aureus was the major pathogen. Patients with acute abscesses had fever, leukocytosis, and purulence at surgery. Patients with chronic abscesses had less fever and leukocytosis, more granulation tissue at surgery, and a greater delay in diagnosis but retained the potential for rapid neurologic deterioration. In contrast to other studies, abscesses in both the lumbar and anterior spinal compartments and patients with specific sources of infection occurred with greater frequency. Myelography was the diagnostic method of choice. Only four of nine patients had diagnostic computed tomography. Earlier diagnosis and treatment led to a significant improvement in outcome. Both steroid administration and greater neurologic impairment adversely affected outcome. Neurologic improvement following surgery was dependent on the duration of the deficit. A combination of antibiotics and surgical drainage remains the treatment of choice.\r"

HSV hepatitis usually occurs as part of disseminated HSV infection and is characterized by fulminant hepatic necrosis with serum transaminase levels frequently elevated 100- to 1,000-fold. Disseminated intravascular coagulation was present in 90% of the cases. Outcome was poor; 86% of the patients died. Eighty-six percent of the patients had an underlying condition associated with impaired host defenses. Renal transplantation (26%), steroid use other than in renal transplant patients (26%), and pregnancy (23%) were the most frequent underlying conditions. Early recognition and prompt initiation of antiviral therapy may offer a chance for improved survival rates.\r"

He was hospitalized on numerous occasions for recurrent episodes of bacteremia involving enteric flora; hypertrophic osteoarthropathy and aortoduodenal fistula were documented before surgery. Symptoms and signs of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy were markedly alleviated after removal of the infected prosthesis. A review of the literature revealed seven additional patients with a similar presentation. The diagnosis of infected arterial graft with enteroprosthetic fistula may be extremely difficult, and a delay in this diagnosis may be lethal.

More stringent licensing requirements, mandatory accreditation for specialty programs, and legislation restricting Medicare expenditure on direct education may help to keep the numbers of specialists down. However, once saturation is reached, it will persist longer in ID than in other, older subspecialties. In the future, many ID specialists may spend much of their time evaluating conditions that have no obvious relation to an infectious disease. Rather than an unfortunate waste, however, ID training will be advantageous in these circumstances because of the excellent background acquired in evaluating histories and performing thorough physical examinations and the emphasis placed on cost-effective use of antimicrobial agents. Physicians well trained in ID are likely to be cost conscious in the use of the laboratory as well as parsimonious in the use of drugs. A further lowering of costs probably results from contributions of these physicians to hospital formulary committees and infection control programs. Thus, residents in internal medicine who wish ID training should be given the opportunity; they will be better internists for the experience.\r"

The observed ventilatory volumes and capacities and diffusing capacity were significantly lower than the predicted values. Vital capacity was significantly reduced in patients with adverse NYHA or haemodynamic classification. Between the various NYHA or haemodynamic groups no statistically significant difference was demonstrable in pulmonary function or diffusing capacity or in airway resistance. Ventilatory obstruction was found also in patients without previous shunt. Other lung function tests showed no significant difference between the shunt and the non-shunt group. Nor was distribution of lung perfusion significantly affected by shunt. No correlation was seen between lung function and bicycle ergometric findings. However, in non-shunt patients who had ventilatory obstruction or impaired diffusing capacity, exercise tolerance was significantly higher than in patients who had had palliative shunt.\r"

Palliative shunt operation had been performed in childhood in 28 cases. The clinical condition was good in 25 patients (78%). 13 of whom had mean gradient between right ventricle and pulmonary artery 16.0 +/- 4.2 mmHg and systolic right ventricular pressure 39.0 +/- 10.0 mmHg, while 12 had right ventricular pressure 62.6 +/- 16.3 mmHg. In these groups the maximum exercise capacity was, respectively, 136.7 +/- 36.1 and 106.1 +/- 30.8 W/min. Three other patients were in satisfactory, and four in poor clinical condition, with right ventricular systolic pressure, respectively, 74.3 +/- 10.9 and 91.5 +/- 60.0 mmHg. The gradient from right ventricle to pulmonary artery averaged 58.5 +/- 10.4 mmHg in the latter group but, despite the obstructed pulmonary outflow tract, the exercise capacity (116.7 +/- 28.9 W/min) was similar to that in the groups with better clinical results. It is concluded that in most patients with palliative surgery in childhood, tetralogy of Fallot can be successfully corrected in adult life. The causes of right ventricular impairment do not significantly reduce the exercise capacity.\r"

In the present experiments, the ischemia time was reduced to 20 min (37 degrees C). Ventricular work after ischemia was best in control rats with potassium cardioplegia only. Supplementing the cardioplegic solution with PEP and ATP (group I) resulted in significantly reduced postischemic ventricular work and increased efflux of the creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB). The same result was obtained when adenosine monophosphate (AMP) was added to the supplementation (group II). When guanosine monophosphate (GMP) was added instead of AMP (group III), the negative effects of PEP and ATP in the cardioplegic solution were partly abolished. Plain potassium cardioplegia, without additives, nevertheless gave the best results. There were no significant intergroup differences in the myocardial content of adenine nucleotides. The results contrasted with those in the previous study of more protracted ischemic trauma (30 min at 37 degrees C) and possible explanations are discussed.\r"

Rat hearts were subjected to normothermic ischemia for 15 or 30 min and then freeze-clamped. During ischemia there was gradual reduction of high-energy phosphates, but the hearts with creatine phosphate supplement showed higher myocardial content of ATP and of the creatine compound. Other hearts, subjected to 20 min of ischemia, were reperfused with blood for 40 min. Creatine phosphate supplementation resulted in better left ventricular isovolumic work during spontaneous activity, but in paced activity (400 beats/min) no significant differences were seen. After reperfusion, supplemented hearts showed a tendency to higher levels of ATP and creatine phosphate. In all three groups the hearts with cardioplegic supplement had significantly increased myocardial content of pyruvate without proportional lactate increase. The results indicate that creatine phosphate may be an effective constituent in cardioplegic solution.\r"

All patients underwent transthoracic removal of the tumour. Complications of the surgery included two cases of postoperative oesophageal fistula; in both instances the lumen of the oesophagus had been entered during the extirpation of the tumour. The surgery was effective in eliminating the most prominent symptom, i.e. dysphagia. However, follow-up examinations 11.1 +/- 6.8 (SD) years later revealed reflux symptoms and endoscopically and histologically verified oesophagitis in seven of the nine (78%) surviving patients. Additionally, two of them had developed Barrett's oesophagus, 10 and 19 years, respectively, after the primary surgery. These two patients underwent subsequent transabdominal antireflux procedures (Nissen fundoplication).

In addition to pneumonectomy (29) or lobectomy (20), surgery included resection of the thoracic wall (8 cases) left atrium (12), pericardium (15), parietal pleura (13) and oesophagus (1 case). Among the 47 \"surgical survivors\" (96%), the mean survival time was 19.9 +/- SD 20.3 months, and only four patients (9%) were alive after 5 years or more. The cumulative 5-year survival was 14% (4/29 patients). Poorly differentiated tumour forms (squamous cell cancer) carried the worst prognosis, whereas the type of resection and presence or absence of lymph-node metastases did not per se influence survival. The prognosis in extended resection is poorer than in standard lung resection, but superior to that in simple exploration. The surgeon therefore should always be prepared to extend a planned resection when a patient on the operating table is found to have extension of lung cancer to other intrathoracic organs, since only in invasion of the chest wall is the surgical strategy as a rule clear from the outset.\r"

Results show that predictive value of the perfusion scan was significant (p less than 0.02) with regard to forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1, r = 0.80). A fair but not significant correlation existed in the prediction of vital capacity (VC, r = 0.64) and total lung capacity (TLC, r = 0.71).

  ".W": "An oocyte expression system was used to test the relation between a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone encoding the liver gap junction protein and cell-cell channels. Total liver polyadenylated messenger RNA injected into oocytes induced cell-cell channels between paired oocytes. This induction was blocked by simultaneous injection of antisense RNA transcribed from the gap junction cDNA. Messenger RNA selected by hybridization to the cDNA clone and translated in oocyte pairs yielded a higher junctional conductance than unselected liver messenger RNA. Cell-cell channels between oocytes were also formed when the cloned cDNA was expressed under the control of a heat-shock promoter. A concentration-dependent induction of channels was observed in response to injection with in vitro transcribed gap junction messenger RNA. Thus, the liver gap junction cDNA encodes a protein that is essential for the formation of functional cell-cell channels.\r"

The RDE was inactivated by the serine esterase inhibitor di-isopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP). [3H]DFP-labeling localized the active site to the heavy chain of the glycoprotein. DFP did not alter the hemagglutination or fusion properties of the protein, but markedly decreased infectivity of the virus, demonstrating that the RDE is important for primary infection. Finally, DFP-treated INF-C bound specifically and irreversibly to cells expressing 9-O-acetylated sialic acids. This provides a probe for a molecule that was hitherto very difficult to study.\r"
