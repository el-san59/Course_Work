  ".W": "Although a number of factors, including age and ventricular loading, are known to influence the pattern of left ventricular (LV) filling as depicted by Doppler echocardiographic transmitral flow velocities, few and conflicting data are available regarding the influence of heart rate (HR). Therefore, 20 volunteers (mean age 30 years) were evaluated with pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiography, performed with the sample volume placed at the mitral anulus level in the apical 4-chamber projection. Transmitral flow measurements comprised peak and integrated early passive (E) and late atrial (A) filling velocities and the slope of velocity decline from peak E filling. Measurements were recorded during baseline (sinus rhythm, mean 70 beats/min) and during transesophageal atrial pacing (mean 88 beats/min). LV end-diastolic dimension, mean arterial pressure and PR interval (corrected for pacing-induced delay in interatrial conduction time) were unchanged during pacing versus baseline measurements. Peak and integrated E filling velocities averaged 0.59 +/- 0.09 m/s and 6 +/- 1 cm, respectively, at baseline and were not significantly greater at the higher HR. In contrast, baseline peak and integrated A velocities averaged 0.37 +/- 0.06 m/s and 2.3 +/- 0.7 cm, respectively, but were significantly greater at the higher HR (0.5 +/- 0.07 m/s and 3.2 +/- 1.1 cm, respectively [p less than 0.003 vs baseline for each]). Further analysis of a subgroup of 9 subjects for whom Doppler measurements were available at 3 HRs (sinus 70; pacing 80 and 90) yielded strong evidence for a linear relation between HR and peak A velocity (A = 0.008 HR - 0.21, with p less than 0.0001 for significance of the linear trend).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-four heart transplant recipients were studied by right-sided cardiac catheterization after endomyocardial biopsy. A direct linear relation was found between systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and cyclosporine trough blood levels, which were negatively related to heart rate. The effect of cyclosporine on pulmonary vascular resistance, however, was not statistically significant by multivariate analysis when patient age was considered. In contrast, renal function appeared unrelated to systemic vascular resistance or heart rate. It appears that cyclosporine trough blood levels may have a direct effect on systemic vascular resistance as well as an unexplained negative chronotropic effect on heart rate.\r"

After an extensive baseline physiologic assessment (Time 1), in which aerobic capacity and blood lipids were measured, subjects were randomized to an aerobic exercise condition (cycle ergometry, 3 times per week for 1 hour), nonaerobic yoga (2 times per week for 1 hour), or a waiting list nonexercise control group for 4 months, and then underwent a second (Time 2) assessment. At the completion of the second assessment, all remaining subjects completed 4 months of aerobic exercise and were reevaluated (Time 3). Subjects were given the option of participating in 6 additional months of supervised aerobic exercise, and all available subjects completed a fourth assessment (Time 4) 14 months after their initial baseline evaluation. Results indicated that subjects generally exhibited a 10 to 15% improvement in peak oxygen consumption after 4 months of aerobic exercise training, and a 1 to 6% improvement in aerobic power with additional aerobic exercise training. On the other hand, subjects, especially men, continued to have improvements in submaximal exercise performance (i.e., anaerobic threshold). In addition, aerobic exercise was associated with an improved lipid profile; subjects participating in aerobic exercise for up to 14 months exhibited increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Maintenance of regular aerobic exercise for an extended time interval is associated with greater cardiovascular benefits among older adults than has been reported previously.\r"

A predictive equation was derived by use of data on height, BR, weight, age, and sex from 130 randomly selected volunteers and was applied to the remaining 26 volunteers. When compared with the manufacturer's software, the new equation increased correlations with hydrostatic weighing for predicting percent body fat and fat-free mass (FFM) from 0.70 to 0.92 and 0.79 to 0.97, respectively. The manufacturer's software underestimated FFM by 5.3 +/- 8.6 kg (P less than 0.05) when compared with FFM derived from hydrostatic weighing whereas the new equation improved the accuracy to -0.1 +/- 3.3 kg (NS). There were no significant effects of fluid intake (700 mL) or breakfast consumption on body composition as determined by BR. BR represents a simple and accurate way to assess body composition in Pima Indians with our newly derived equation.\r"

Weight and fat mass were better predictors for women and excellent predictors for men. We found that weight and height accurately predicted fat mass if suitable exponents were used in the expression wt/htx. Testing predictive equations with our own and other sets of data showed good agreement between estimated and observed SDEs. As a base for estimating individual energy requirements. SDE is more precise than basal metabolic rate and it can be predicted with useful accuracy from simple measures of weight and height.\r"

Energy cost of lactation amounted to 650 kcal/d (breast-milk production, 745 +/- 130 g/d). When compared with nonlactating counterparts, the lactating women mainly achieved energy balance by eating more. Sixteen of the 40 lactating women were also studied at 56 wk. Their cost of lactation at 5-13 wk was 630 kcal/d (breast-milk production, 720 +/- 124 g/d); these women met their energy cost of lactation by eating more (415 kcal/d); by tissue mobilization (35 kcal/d), and by reducing energy expenditure (180 kcal/d). The present study helps in the understanding of how well-nourished women with an adequate lactational performance may cope in everyday life with the energy stress of lactation, and suggests that current recommendations of energy needs during lactation are too high.\r"

Diet, reported by use of a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), did not change over time. Most FA variations were quantitative, occurring in FFA and CE fractions. Correlations between diet and FAs occurred mostly in men for whom dietary percent fat energy was positively correlated with percent monounsaturated plasma TG FAs, and ethanol (g/d) was positively correlated with plasma CE 16:1 omega 7 (mumol/L). These findings indicate that quantitative variations exist in plasma FAs of a normal population, with no detectable alteration in diet; the FFQ may be used to reflect the qualitative status of plasma FA. Factors such as ethanol consumption and sex differences may influence FA metabolism.\r"

However, increased catabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was reported and could be due to increased availability of peripheral lipoprotein lipase (LPL) or hepatic lipase (HL). In this study plasma lipoproteins and postheparin activities of LPL and HL were determined in 12 patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia before and during isocaloric substitution of omega-3 fatty acids (10 g/d) for 4 wk. Omega-3 polyunsaturates resulted in 53% and 61% reductions in plasma triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations, respectively (P less than 0.0001). However, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations increased by 26% (P less than 0.001). Activities of postheparin LPL and HL essentially remained the same. Thus, in patients with primary hypertriglyceridemia, reduction in plasma triglyceride concentrations and increase in LDL-cholesterol concentrations mediated by omega-3 polyunsaturates seem to occur without an increase in LPL or HL activities.\r"

  ".W": "We studied malabsorption of fat in neonates who were fed either a lard-modified formula (n = 22, gestational age, 33.6 +/- 3.9 wk) or an unmodified formula (n = 14, gestational age, 34.1 +/- 3.7 wk). In both groups fecal lipid consisted almost completely (greater than 90%) of free fatty acids, whose composition was highly correlated with the corresponding formula's fatty acid composition [r = 0.96 (lard modified) and r = 0.99 (standard)]. Both groups had similar relative amounts and compositions of fecal cholesterol esters and triglycerides. Plasma and, to a lesser extent, erythrocyte membrane long-chain-fatty-acid compositions correlated with those of the corresponding formulas. We suggest that the extensive intestinal hydrolysis and limited absorption of dietary lipids is, at least partly, due to lipolysis in the colon. Appearance of triglycerides in the colon may be due to a rapid small-intestinal passage in relation to small-intestinal lipolysis.\r"

The effects of chronic oral administration of beta-carotene, a carotenoid partially metabolized to retinol, on plasma lipid concentrations have not been well studied; therefore, we studied 61 subjects over 12 mo while they were enrolled in a skin-cancer-prevention study in which patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 30) or 50 mg beta-carotene/d orally (n = 31). At study entry and 1 y later, fasting blood samples were obtained for measurement of triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, retinol, and beta-carotene. Retinol concentrations changed minimally in both groups; beta-carotene concentration increased an average of 12.1 +/- 47 nmol/L in the placebo group and 4279 +/- 657 nmol/L in the active-treatment group. Both groups experienced similar small increases in triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations and small decreases in HDL cholesterol. Daily oral administration of 50 mg beta-carotene/d did not affect plasma lipid concentrations.\r"

Serum and urinary uric acid concentrations were measured before and after the ingestion of proteins. Serum uric acid decreased significantly 3 h after ingestion of lactalbumin and casein but increased after soybean consumption. Urate clearance was significantly increased after ingestion of each of the three proteins. Multivariate analysis of urate clearance during lactalbumin and casein loads showed that independent correlation was obtained for serum alanine and urea concentration. These results demonstrate that, in addition to their known uricosuric effect, milk proteins acutely decrease serum uric acid concentration. Analysis of the effects of lactalbumin and casein on urinary uric acid elimination suggests that the uricosuric effect of proteins is a multifactorial phenomenon.\r"

Prevalence of lactose maldigestion increased with age (y = -7.30 + 6.49x, r = 0.88, P = 0.004), being 29.4% and 80.0% at ages 5 and 12 y, respectively. Before testing, the reported prevalences of milk-related symptoms by children with high and low lactose-digestion capacity were 21.1% and 39.7% (chi 2 = 5.96, P = 0.015), respectively. However, the corresponding prevalences of lactose intolerance after ingestion of milk were 7.3% and 8.6% (chi 2 = 0.1, P = 0.72) and only three children had a delta H2 greater than or equal to 20 ppm postprandially. Although intestinal lactase activity declines before age 5 y and many Greek children report milk-related symptoms, true malabsorption and intolerance of lactose after a glass of milk is rarely seen at this age.\r"

We therefore studied, in six healthy subjects, the effect of rectally infused solutions containing acetate alone (180 mmol), propionate alone (180 mmol), or a mixture of acetate (180 mmol) and propionate (60 mmol). Relative to the control infusion of normal saline, acetate increased serum cholesterol, glucagon, and acetate concentrations and reduced free fatty acids (FFAs) within 30 min. Propionate alone increased serum propionate, glucose, and glucagon with no effects on cholesterol and a delayed fall in FFAs. The addition of propionate to acetate resulted in no significant rise in serum cholesterol. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that colonic propionate is a gluconeogenic substrate in humans and inhibits the utilization of acetate for cholesterol synthesis.\r"

Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose. Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group. Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations.

The 16 remaining children had concentrations of the vitamer so low that they indicated a potential severe vitamin B-6 deficiency. However, none of the children had ever presented with any of the classical vitamin B-6-deficiency symptoms. Treatment of three additional FHR children with 100 mg pyridoxine.HCl/d resulted in a moderate and transient elevation of their serum PLP concentrations, a dramatic elevation of their erythrocyte PLP concentrations, and no improvement in clinical condition. Serum or plasma PLP concentrations are an inappropriate index for determining vitamin B-6 status in people with FHR and perhaps in others with elevated alkaline phosphatase activity.\r"

Thus, chemical and animal studies as well as the opposite effects of ozone and vitamin E on the immune system suggest the hypothesis that vitamin E can protect humans against the harmful effects of chronic exposures to ozone. However, because most humans are not vitamin E deficient, the more relevant question is whether amounts of vitamin E above the minimum of dietary requirement provide increased protection. The need for and design of further studies to answer this question are discussed.\r"

Chronic administration of dl-alpha-tocopherol (440, 880, or 1320 mg/d for 28 d) resulted in a steady state that occurred by days 4-5 of supplementation. Discontinuation of the treatment after day 28 was associated with a decline of plasma alpha-tocopherol, which returned to the pretreatment concentrations between 12 and 20 d. The plasma elevation of alpha-tocopherol was affected by dietary fat intake. Individuals consuming a high-fat diet showed significantly greater plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrations as compared with those fed a low-fat diet.

Differences between colostrum and mature milk or among samples of mature milk collected at 1, 3, and 6 mo were not statistically significant. Because of significantly increased volumes of milk over the lactation period, approximately twice as much vitamin K was delivered in mature milk as in colostrum. Within normal ranges, concentrations of vitamin K in milk were not predicted by dietary intake of vegetables or fat. Vitamin K was correlated with fat in colostrum and was localized in the lipid core of the milk fat globule but was not associated with membranes. Vitamin K in human milk is insufficient to meet recommended intakes for infants aged less than 6 mo. Population and clinical studies are needed to assess the vitamin K status of exclusively breast-fed infants and to evaluate current recommendations.\r"

Six patients with high jejunostomy were tested in a random order with the standard solution or a solution containing maltodextrins (18 g Glucidex 12/L) enriched with 2.5 g NaCl/L. Solutions were administered via a nasogastric tube at a rate of 2 mL/min. Jejunal effluent was collected during an 8-h period. The net 8-h fluid absorption was not significantly different in the two periods. Glucose absorption was greater than 90% of the administered amount for both solutions. Net sodium absorption was greater for the maltodextrin solution than for the standard solution (56 +/- 12 vs 24 +/- 20 mmol, P less than 0.05). We conclude that replacement of glucose with maltodextrins and addition of sodium in the standard oral rehydration solution results in improved sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome.\r"

The proportion of individuals with LEHs was nearly two-fold greater (74.4%; 95% CI 64.7-84.1%) in the control than in the supplemented group (39.5%; 95% CI 28.6-50.4%; chi 2 = 9.44; P = 0.001). Although the estimated peak age at formation, approximately 2-2.5 y, is similar in both groups, the proportion of early (before 1.5 y) and late (after 3.0 y) LEHs was greater in the control group. LEH was also more common in females and was associated with an increase in illness days and a decrease in growth velocity. Results of this study suggest that mild to moderate undernutrition during enamel formation is causally linked to the formation of LEHs.\r"

Stunting was prevalent (29%); 16% were moderately wasted. The prevalence of stunting and hair zinc concentrations less than 1.68 mumol/g was gender related; 38% of males vs 20% of females had Z scores for height-for-age (HAZ scores) less than -2 (P = 0.04); 26% of males vs 11% of females had hair zinc less than 1.68 mumol/g (P less than 0.05). Analysis of variance showed that age, sex, hemoglobin, and log hair zinc influenced HAZ scores, depending on the age group; both sex and the log of the hair zinc values were significant factors in the older children. Stunting in Worsera children was related to chronic deficits in energy and protein and was excerbated in the older male children by suboptimal zinc status.\r"

After 10 d equilibration, apparent intestinal absorption of macronutrients was estimated from a standard 3-d metabolic balance and compared with that estimated by using the ratio of PEG to macronutrients in a single random sample of feces. Correlation coefficients for this comparison were 0.649, 0.715, and 0.924 for nitrogen, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. Additionally, apparent intestinal absorptions estimated from two separate consecutive 3-d metabolic-balance studies were compared, showing correlation coefficients of 0.106, 0.653, and 0.463 for nitrogen, carbohydrate, and fat, respectively. The random sample-marker technique appears to be acceptable for measuring apparent absorption of macronutrients and is at least as accurate as a standard 3-d metabolic-balance study.\r"

A388 cells (a human skin squamous cell carcinoma cell line) were found to produce desmoplakin-1 and mRNA from this cell line was used to prepare a random primed cDNA library. Screening 60,000 recombinants of the library with an affinity purified anti-demoplakin-1 antibody resulted in initial identification of four clones from which one 1500 base pair clone was isolated by plaque purification. The identity of this desmoplakin clone was confirmed by demonstrating that antibody affinity purified on the protein product of the clone bound desmoplakins 1 and 2 in Western blots. Thus, the clone appears to code for the shared region of desmoplakins 1 and 2.\r"

The design was a prospective, observational study at a university-affiliated hospital. Seventy-eight patients with bacteremia were evaluated. A clinical grade of acceptable or not acceptable was assigned to each antibiotic prescription by a consensus panel. The consensus panel found that 34.6% of antibiotic prescriptions were unacceptable (clinical grade). At least one flaw in the chain of reasoning was found in 56.4% of the 78 cases evaluated. Assessment of the clinical setting was correct in 94.9% of the cases; the portal of entry was identified in 91%; adequate knowledge of the bacterial flora at the suspected site of infection was found in 69%; the diagnostic workup was appropriate in 81%, and the correct antibiotic susceptibility patterns were given in 72%. A correct chain of reasoning was more likely to result in an acceptable clinical grade than flawed reasoning (p less than 0.005). However, an appropriate antibiotic selection was made by some physicians despite flawed reasoning, and inappropriate antibiotic selection occurred in a few cases despite fautless reasoning. In 3.8% of cases, unexpected organisms appeared in blood culture. Prescription of broad spectrum antibiotics may then be learned response. If so, educational efforts that emphasize narrow, rather than broad spectrum prescribing may be inadequate to change physician prescribing habits.\r"

To increase our understanding of this problem, the cerebral blood flow, the brain uptake index (BUI) of 3-O-methyl glucose and the concentration of 3H-cytochalasin B binding sites were determined in diabetic rats and diabetic rats treated with insulin. The BUI of 3-O-methyl glucose was significantly reduced (less than 0.001) in diabetic rats (32.7 +/- 1.2%) compared to control rats (41.9 +/- 1.0%). This change could not be attributed to an alteration in cerebral blood flow or to a non-specific change in BBB permeability. Normalization of blood glucose with insulin therapy corrected the BUI measurements in diabetic rats (42.2 +/- 1.4%). The level of measurable glucose transporters measured with 3H-cytochalasin B binding assay did not appear to be reduced in the diabetic brain microvessels. The data indicate that the reduced brain uptake of glucose in chronic hyperglycemia can occur in the absence of a change in glucose transporter concentration.\r"

The authors were, therefore, intrigued when a patient with methimazole-associated aplastic anemia who satisfied criteria for severe disease recovered rapidly and completely once her drug was withdrawn. Review of the English language literature revealed ten fully documented cases of aplastic anemia associated with use of the antithyroid drugs methimazole, carbimazole, and propylthiouracil. Analysis of the ten and of an eleventh case presented here indicated that the disorder is typically characterized by severe pancytopenia and profound marrow hypoplasia, yet surprisingly good prognosis, ie, minimum survival of more than 70% with partial or complete recovery from symptoms and cytopenias in survivors within 2-5 weeks. The only deaths, both in the 1950s, were from brain hemorrhage in patients who were not transfused with platelets. The discrepancy between the clinical and laboratory severity of antithyroid drug-associated aplasia, on the one hand, and its relatively good prognosis and short term course, on the other, should be kept in mind when considering these patients for bone marrow transplantation or for therapy with antithymocyte globulin.\r"

Intraglomerular hypertension causing deposition of protein in the mesangium leads to glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Screening for microalbuminuria can predict which type I diabetic patients will develop nephropathy. The decline in renal function in established diabetic nephropathy can be slowed with aggressive treatment of hypertension. The use of ACE inhibitors may also decrease intraglomerular hypertension. Whether similar treatment in the person with preclinical diabetic nephropathy would delay or prevent the onset of diabetic nephropathy is being investigated. Restricted protein intake, anti-platelet and rheolitic drugs may have a role in the treatment of established diabetic nephropathy. In end stage renal failure, renal transplantation is the treatment of choice. When transplantation cannot be performed, chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is preferable to hemodialysis.\r"

It is controlled by both the intrinsic and extrinsic nerves of the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser degree, the gastrointestinal hormones. Therefore, any abnormality of the above factors, theoretically, can cause gastrointestinal dysmotility. In a clinical situation, commonly seen is gastrointestinal dysmotility caused by either smooth muscle or intrinsic and extrinsic nerves dysfunction. Diseases that cause smooth muscle dysfunction include familial visceral myopathies, nonfamilial visceral myopathies, collagen disease, muscular dystrophies, amyloidosis, thyroid disease, and so on. Diseases that cause enteric nerve dysfunction include familial visceral neuropathies, nonfamilial visceral neuropathies, diabetes mellitus, Chagas' disease, ganglioneuromatosis of the intestine, visceral neuropathy of carcinomatosis, Parkinson's disease, and so on. The patients with neuromuscular disease of the gastrointestinal tract have a wide range of clinical manifestations regardless of the underlying cause. At one end of the spectrum, the patients may be asymptomatic, and at the other end of the spectrum, the patients may have functional obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Plain abdominal x-rays, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and small bowel x-rays, enteroclysis, barium enema, and manometric studies are useful for the work-up of these patients. Enteroclysis is especially helpful in ruling out mechanical obstruction of the small intestine in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. There is no effective drug to improve gastrointestinal motility. Surgery may be helpful in selected cases of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility.\r"

  ".W": "In recent years, the therapeutic approach to mild hypertension has evolved from a stepped care approach to one including varied, initial monotherapies, with the selection of drug based on factors present in an individual patient, followed by combination therapy. The greatest cumulative experience of the value of antihypertensive therapy has been obtained with diuretics. The reduction in risk of cardiovascular disease with successful antihypertensive therapy using conventional agents, including diuretics, is not as great as might have been anticipated by the magnitude of change in blood pressure. This could be due to antecedent cardiovascular injury prior to therapy or to risk factors induced by therapy. The recent introduction of a new generation of drugs with combined diuretic and hypotensive effects that reduce blood pressure without inducing the biochemical changes associated with thiazides, offers an opportunity to evaluate this question. Indapamide is the first of this new generation to be released. Its pharmacologic characteristics show that it has the prerequisites to be considered a first-line drug for use in hypertension. It meets the requirements of a Phase II or second generation drug in that it has similar efficacy, but less short term toxicity than first generation drugs. It has been introduced at a cost that is competitive with thiazides and potassium-sparing combination drugs and is cheaper than many other classes of antihypertensive drugs. The major caution in promoting its use is that its long term effect on morbidity and mortality in hypertensive disease has not yet been evaluated. In summary, this is a promising new drug that has the potential to replace first generation thiazides in the routine management of hypertension.\r"

It is predominantly a disease of young people without underlying valvular heart disease. Characteristic clinical features include a high frequency of congestive heart failure and nephritis and a proclivity for aortic valve involvement, commonly with associated ring abscess, and large vegetations. Genitourinary symptoms, arthralgias, and rash are uncommon. Previously undescribed features include involvement of all four valves simultaneously, recurrence on an aortic valve prosthesis, and a high frequency of terminal complement deficiencies.

Spectra of choroidal hemangioma, osteoma, and metastasis were also obtained in vivo and compared with those of uveal melanomas. Analysis of spectra performed at 1.5 T showed significant peaks of phosphomonoesters, inorganic phosphate, phosphodiesters, phosphocreatine, and adenosine 5'-triphosphates. The unusually high concentration of phosphodiesters may be considered as a marker for uveal melanomas and other choroidal tumors. By analyzing the ratio of phosphocreatine to phosphodiesters spectral area values, we interpreted qualitatively spectra of intraocular tumors to differentiate malignant tumors from benign lesions. Nevertheless, the main limitation of interpreting the spectra was their contamination by signals from surrounding tissues.\r"

We used a grading system (grade 0 through grade 4) for nerve visibility based on slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination and photographic documentation. All 20 normal eyes showed either grade 0 or grade 1, which indicated no pathologic thickening of corneal nerves. Sixteen of the 28 eyes (57%) with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, however, were evaluated as grade 2 or higher, which indicated thickened corneal nerves. The incidence of high nerve visibility in eyes with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A was significantly greater compared to normal eyes (P less than .0001), anterior keratoconus (P less than .0001), and nonhereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma (P = .0012). Furthermore, eight of the 28 eyes (29%) with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A showed markedly prominent corneal nerves (grade 3 and 4), a prominence similar to those seen in eyes with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B. There was no definite relationship among prominent nerve, age of the patient, and occurrence of pheochromocytoma. These findings suggest that over half of all patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A show corneal nerves pathologically thickened to different degrees.\r"

The model requires some theoretically and clinically reasonable assumptions regarding the relative importance of forces acting on the iris. Former analyses made false assumptions about contact between the lens and the iris, as well as inappropriate substitution of the physical concept of force for tension. The validity of the new model and its inherent assumptions can now be tested with biometric measurements made in normal eyes and eyes with shallow anterior chambers.\r"

The average discrepancy between the calculated actual and the theoretically predicted iris position was only -0.01 to +0.03 mm. The close agreement validates the model under normal conditions and in the presence of relative (nonsynechial) pupillary block. The theoretical iris shape may not occur under conditions that violate the underlying physical assumptions of the mathematical model, such as when iridectomy eliminates the pressure difference between the anterior and posterior chamber or when synechiae introduce additional forces on the iris other than the ones included in the analysis.\r"

Patients were chosen so that a 1.6:1 ratio of dark to light irides was obtained. Within one-half hour after medication, thymoxamine-treated nonbrown irides constricted significantly compared to their fellow placebo-treated irides (P less than .001). Thymoxamine-treated pupils of nonbrown irides were 1.0 to 3.1 mm smaller than placebo-treated fellow eyes. Thymoxamine-treated light brown irides constricted less (0.6 to 2.0 mm) and more slowly compared to fellow placebo-treated irides. Thymoxamine did not reverse the mydriasis in eyes of patients with dark brown irides. Thymoxamine appears similar to other adrenergic agents that bind to melanin, delaying onset and strength of action. Its efficacy as presently formulated may be limited, in part, by iris color.\r"

A chart review of 792 consecutive patients at the Retinal Unit, West Virginia University, during a six-month period disclosed that 24 of 590 patients (4%) had chorioretinal scars suggestive of toxoplasmosis. I concluded from these data that in at least one subgroup of patients with Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis there is a significant association with the chorioretinal scars of toxoplasmosis (P less than .01), and this is suggestive of a causal relationship.\r"

Bilateral fibrothecomas from one patient appeared to lack cytogenetic aberrations: the remaining nine tumors were characterized by trisomy for chromosome 12. Cytogenetic aberrations in the two granulosa cell tumors were much less complex than those described previously in undifferentiated carcinomas; accordingly cytogenetic analyses might be useful in distinguishing these categories. The consistent occurrence of trisomy 12 in different varieties of granulosa-stromal cell tumors suggests a common mechanism of oncogenesis within this diverse group of neoplasms.

  ".W": "Endotoxin, a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of gram-negative bacteria, induces alveolar macrophages to express interleukin-1 (IL-1). Lipopolysaccharide and IL-1 both cause severe acute neutrophilic inflammation in the lung after intratracheal injection, suggesting that LPS-induced IL-1 expression contributes to the pathogenesis of LPS-induced acute inflammation. In the present study, the role of IL-1 in LPS-induced acute pneumonia was investigated by quantitating the acute inflammation occurring at 6 hours after the intratracheal injection of LPS as compared to the same timepoint after the intratracheal coinjection of LPS and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). The IL-1ra was found to inhibit LPS-induced acute inflammation (P greater than 0.0001) as measured by the number of neutrophils recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage. The LPS-induced emigration of neutrophils was inhibited by as much as 45%. Recombinant IL-1 beta-induced neutrophil emigration into the lung was inhibited by 95% when IL-1ra was coinjected intratracheally with IL-1 beta. Coinjection of recombinant IL-1 beta and LPS increased the neutrophilic exodus as compared to the intratracheal injection of either agent alone. Intratracheal injection of LPS induces a progressive increase in IL-1ra mRNA expression in whole-lung RNA preparations, suggesting that endogenous IL-1ra may play an important role as a negative feedback mechanism to downregulate LPS initiated IL-1-mediated acute inflammation. In conclusion IL-1ra inhibits both LPS- and IL-1-induced neutrophilic inflammation and may therefore prove clinically useful as an anti-inflammatory agent for the therapy of either septic or aseptic IL-1-mediated acute inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "The endothelium lining the posterior corneal surface performs physiologic pump functions essential to corneal clarity and integrity. A hallmark of keratitis, anterior ocular inflammation, and corneal allograft rejection is leukocyte adherence to the corneal endothelium (CE) forming keratitic precipitates. To elucidate mechanisms governing cornea-leukocyte interactions, cultured human CE cells and intact corneas were examined for expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which binds the lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) on all leukocytes and enhances delayed-type hypersensitivity mediated by class II major histocompatibility complex antigens. Immunohistochemistry on culture CE cells using monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 antibody yield positive staining that increased after exposure to interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN). Standard leukocyte adherence assays demonstrated ICAM-1-mediated CE-neutrophil binding, which was specifically blocked by antibody to ICAM-1 or antibodies to LFA-1 on neutrophils. In whole human corneas, gamma-IFN increased CE and stromal keratocyte ICAM-1 immunoreactivity and enhanced CE-neutrophil adherence. As in CE cell cultures, antibody to ICAM-1 effectively blocked neutrophil binding to the CE cells of whole corneas. These results are the first to demonstrate ICAM-1 in ocular tissue. They indicate that CE cells express functional ICAM-1, which may be modulated by inflammatory cytokines, ICAM-1 provides mechanisms for keratitic precipitate formation, regulation of corneal leukocyte trafficking and the generation of immune responses that may be crucial to allograft rejection.\r"

  ".W": "Using an antibody probe specific for the class of fibronectins that contain the oncofetal domain, it was shown that oncofetal fibronectin (onfFN) is present wherever trophoblasts make contact with extraplacental extracellular matrix (ECM). In normal human implantation sites, onfFN was localized to a highly specific region-the ECM connecting extravilous trophoblasts and trophoblastic cell columns to the uterine decidua. This same zone of onfFN was present in an analogous location in extrauterine gestations. Like these in vivo extravillous trophoblasts, isolated cytotrophoblasts in primary culture synthesized and secreted onfFN as they underwent differentiation. Furthermore, when cocultured with an ECM gel, cytotrophoblast aggregates deposited onfFN at cell-ECM contact sites, resembling early implanting trophoblasts in vivo. In the presence of cyclic AMP agonists, onfFN synthesis was inhibited markedly. It is concluded from these results that onfFN is a trophoblast protein that, under cAMP regulation, could mediate implantation and placental-uterine attachment throughout gestation.\r"

The present study was initiated to determine if mepacrine also delays cell death and development of osmotic fragility of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic adult rat cardiomyocytes. Isolated myocyte suspensions were incubated with 3 mmol/l (millimolar) iodoacetic acid and 6 mmol/l amytal (inhibited) or were pelleted into a slurry and layered with oil (ischemic) in the presence and absence of 10 or 50 mumol/l (micromolar) mepacrine. Rates of contracture, cell viability as determined by trypan blue permeability, cell viability after osmotic swelling in 170 mOsm media (osmotic fragility), and cell morphology were monitored. Mepacrine had no effects on rates of contracture, but was found to significantly delay cell death during isotonic incubations of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic cells. In contrast, mepacrine had no effect on the development of osmotic fragility. Incubation of metabolically inhibited myocytes in calcium-free media did not delay contracture or cell injury, but did attenuate the protective effects of mepacrine. This study confirms previous reports that mepacrine protects cells from injury, extends the observations of protection to ischemic isolated adult myocytes, but shows that development of osmotic fragility is not inhibited by mepacrine.\r"

The intrapancreatic allografts grew rapidly, were invasive, and metastasized into the lymph nodes and liver in 2 of 9 cases. In comparison, SC tumors grew relatively slower and formed a large encapsulated mass without invasion and metastases. Histologically, tumors of both sites showed fairly well-differentiated adenocarcinomas of ductal/ductular type resembling the induced primary cancer. Similar to the primary induced pancreatic cancers, tumor cells of both allografts expressed blood-group-related antigens, including A, B, H, Le(b), Le(y), Le(x), and tumor-associated antigen TAG-72. The tumor cells did not express Le(a), CA 19-9, 17-1A, or DU-PAN-2. The expression of these antigens was retained in the metastases and presented the same patterns of reactivity as the allografts. Thus intrapancreatic transplantation provides a rapid model for production of pancreatic cancer with morphologic similarities to human pancreatic cancer.\r"

In unaffected intima, a three-dimensional network consisting of cells of variable shape and probably origin was demonstrated. Cellular shape changed from predominantly stellate in the luminal regions of the elastic-hyperplastic layer to elongated spindlelike cells in the musculoelastic layer of the intima. In the surface layers of the fatty streak, cellular contacts were severed, and lipid droplets were often seen between cellular processes. Along with stellate and elongated cells, the fatty streak also had a number of round monocytelike cells. Lipid inclusions were usually detected in stellate and ovoid cells. The integrity of the cellular network was preserved at the marginal zone of the atherosclerotic plaque, while at the slopes and in the central part of the plaque, cells practically lost all contact with each other. Giant stellate cells embedded in crude fibrillar connective tissue matrix were often found there. Disintegration of the cellular network during atherosclerosis is suggested to play an important role in the development of various lesions.\r"

The authors have sought to further define the role of intrapulmonary TNF in IgG alveolitis and to examine its role in IgA immune complex alveolitis, a neutrophil-independent model of acute lung injury. IgG immune complex lung injury resulted in a marked rise in intrapulmonary TNF activity accompanied by progressive pulmonary PMN accumulation. Intratracheal instillation of neutralizing concentrations of anti-TNF markedly reduced PMN influx measured at 4 hours but had no effect on PMN recruitment quantitated at 2 hours. IgA immune complex deposition resulted in acute lung injury accompanied by increased numbers of intrapulmonary mononuclear phagocytes but few neutrophils. Lung lavage fluids obtained from IgA immune complex-injured rats contained both neutrophil and monocyte chemotactic activities, albeit at twofold to fourfold lower concentrations than observed in IgG-mediated alveolitis. In contrast to IgG complex-mediated alveolitis, lung lavage fluids from IgA-injured rats contained no TNF activity. Intratracheal administration of anti-TNF antibodies had no effect on the development of IgA lung injury as assessed by morphology and measurements of vascular permeability. In vitro exposure of isolated alveolar macrophages to performed IgG immune complexes resulted in dose-dependent TNF secretion, while exposure to IgA complexes resulted in very low levels of TNF secretion. These data suggest that TNF-mediated pulmonary neutrophil recruitment (in IgG lung injury) is manifest chiefly in the late phase (approximately 4 hours) of developing alveolitis. The virtual absence of intrapulmonary TNF activity in evolving IgA immune complex alveolitis may in part account for the limited PMN recruitment observed in this model.\r"

This study examined the effects of minimally oxidized preparations of LDL (MM-LDL) on tissue factor (TF) expression by cultured human endothelial cells. Low-density lipoprotein purified from normal donors was modified by exposure to iron or by prolonged storage, resulting in levels of thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances of approximately 2.5 to 4 nmoles/mg cholesterol. Preparations had less than 2.5 pg of endotoxin per microgram LDL and had no intrinsic procoagulant activity. This form of modified but not native LDL induced TF expression in endothelial cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Peak TF coagulant activity in cells exposed to 40 micrograms/ml MM-LDL were observed at 4 to 6 hours, and ranged from 50 to 500 pg/10(5) cells, compared with less than 10 pg/10(5) cells exposed to native LDL. Northern blot analysis showed TF mRNA levels to increase approximately 30-fold with exposure to MM-LDL for 2 hours. Induction of TF activity was dependent on the concentration of MM-LDL from 1 microgram/ml to 80 micrograms/ml, a range in which cell viability and morphology were unaffected. The findings suggest that minimally oxidized LDL may be a local mediator promoting thrombosis in atherosclerotic lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The early events of liver allograft rejection in untreated rats were studied in the DA to BN rejection strain combination and compared with DA and BN liver isograft recipients. In the liver allografts, T-cell infiltration first occurred at 2 days after transplantation and localized to the portal triads and subjacent to the terminal hepatic venules (THV), regions rich in intensely Ia + spindle and dendritic-shaped interstitial cells. Double staining showed distinct 'clustering' between donor Ia-positive dendritic-shaped cells and W3/25+ infiltrating lymphocytes, or to a lesser extent, OX8+ cells. The infiltrating mononuclear cells underwent blastogenesis and proliferated in both the triads and THV regions at 3 and 4 days. Donor Ia-positive cells were also noted in the W3/25+ periarterial lymphatic sheath and marginal zone of the recipient spleen 1 day after transplantation. The number of these cells in the spleen peaked at 3 to 4 days, but were no longer detectable by 10 to 12 days. Mitotic activity became evident in these same regions by days 3 and 4. Paracortical blastogenesis (day 2) and proliferation (days 3 and 4) were also noted in the regional lymph nodes of liver allograft recipients, but no donor Ia+ cells were found in the mesenteric nodes or thymus of the allograft recipients. These results demonstrate that sensitization of the recipient lymphoid tissue to liver allografts can occur both peripherally (intragraft) and centrally (spleen and lymph nodes). Passenger leukocytes (donor dendritic cells) are likely the primary stimulators of the rejection reaction. Still, it is probable that other pathways of sensitization exist.\r"

  ".W": "Neoplastically modified myoepithelial cells have a key role in developing the histologic characteristics of some salivary gland tumors. S-100 protein expressed in certain of these tumors is suggested to support this role, as the principal component in the human salivary gland reported to be S-100 protein-positive is myoepithelium. Confirmation of such an important aspect is required. Immunoperoxidase staining of parotid salivary gland shows considerably different patterns obtained with antibodies to S-100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, and neurofilaments compared with those for muscle-specific actin and cytokeratin 14; many more cells and their processes associated with acini and ducts are evident with the latter two antibodies. Double immunofluorescent staining with antibodies to either S-100 protein or neuron-specific enolase combined with muscle-specific actin does not reveal colocalization of these antigens in myoepithelial cells. The former localize only to nerve fibers adjacent to, but separate from, acini, and the latter only to myoepithelial cells. It is apparent that S-100 protein staining of the rich network of unmyelinated nerves in the interstitial tissues, evident ultrastructurally, has been misinterpreted as myoepithelium. This result has important implications for histogenetic classifications of salivary gland tumors.\r"

Because incisional healing processes are difficult to quantify, a full-thickness excisional wound model in the rabbit ear was developed to permit detailed analyses of growth-factor-mediated tissue repair. In the present studies, quantitative and qualitative differences in acute inflammatory cell influx, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) deposition, collagen formation, and myofibroblast generation in PDGF-BB (BB homodimer)- and TGF-beta 1-treated wounds were detected when analyzed histochemically and ultrastructurally. Although both growth factors significantly augmented extracellular matrix formation and healing in 10-day wounds compared with controls (P less than 0.002). PDGF-BB markedly increased macrophage influx and GAG deposition, whereas TGF-beta 1 selectively induced significantly more mature collagen bundles at the leading edge of new granulation tissue (P = 0.007). Transforming growth factor-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts demonstrated active collagen fibrillogenesis and accretion of subfibrils at the ultrastructural level. Myofibroblasts, phenotypically modified fibroblasts considered responsible for wound contraction, were observed in control, but were absent in early growth-factor-treated granulating wounds. These results provide important insights into the mechanisms of soft tissue repair and indicate that 1) PDGF-BB induces an inflammatory response and provisional matrix synthesis within wounds that is qualitatively similar but quantitatively increased compared with normal wounds; 2) TGF-beta 1 preferentially triggers synthesis and more rapid maturation of collagen within early wounds; and 3) both growth factors inhibit the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts, perhaps because wound contraction is not required, due to increased extracellular matrix synthesis.\r"

The pattern of antigen expression was correlated with 1) 36 months' clinical follow-up and 2) the pathologic grade. As a means of estimating the proliferation fraction, an additional antigen, Ki67, was also studied in this series. There were major differences in the distribution of cIV and laminin, and in the quantity of cIVase-, LR-, and Ki67-positive cells associated with grade and prognosis. A smaller quantity of cIV and laminin and a higher number of cIVase-, LR-, and Ki67-positive cells were detected in the poorly differentiated compared with the well-differentiated HCCs. The tumors with lower immunoreactivity for cIV and laminin components accompanied by a higher number of cIVase-, LR-, and Ki67-positive cells fall into a group with the poorest overall survival (P less than 0.006). The panel of antigens is proposed as a useful prognostic tool for evaluating HCC tumor aggressiveness.\r"

Experimental procedures included single and double labeling in situ immunohistochemistry with selective morphometric analyses, and steady state immunoblotting of viral proteins. Cellular targets for virus infection were identical for both ts1 and wt MoMuLV and consisted sequentially of 1) splenic megakaryocytes, 2) splenic and thymic lymphocytes, 3) CNS capillary endothelial cells, and 4) CNS pericytes and microglia. Resident microglial cells served as the major reservor and amplifier of virus infection in the CNS of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice; a similar but much less significant role was played by microglia in wt MoMuLV-infected mice. The genesis and progression of severe spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice were both temporally and spatially correlated with amplified virus infection of microglia, and hyperplasia and hypertrophy of both virus-infected and nonvirus-infected microglial cells. Direct virus infection of neurons was never observed. The development of clinical neurologic disease and spongiform lesions in ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice correlated with the accumulation of both viral gag and env gene products in the CNS; there was no selective accumulation of env precursor polyprotein Pr80env. When compared to wt MoMuLV-infected mice, the neurovirulence of ts1 MoMuLV-infected mice occurred by an enhanced ability to replicate in the CNS and to infect and activate more microglia, rather than by a fundamental change in cellular tropism or topography of virus infection.\r"

This culture system allowed normal cultured keratinocytes to stratify and differentiate in a manner similar to normal epidermis. All seven HPV-immortalized cell lines displayed epidermal morphologies on organotypic cultures, which were clearly abnormal and resembled premalignant lesions in vivo. Features of premalignant lesions that were shared by all of the HPV-immortalized cell lines included disorganized tissue architecture, mitotic cells present throughout the living layers of the epidermal sheet, abnormal mitoses, enlarged nuclei, and variable cell size and shape. Most HPV-immortalized cell lines were stable in terms of epidermal morphology with long-term passage in culture. Two of the HPV-18--immortalized cell lines, however, lost all morphologically apparent terminal squamous differentiation potential after long-term passage in monolayer culture. These results strongly support the idea that immortalization of squamous epithelial cells in culture by HPV-transforming genes generates a morphologically premalignant cell.\r"

  ".W": "Reported here is the structural and immunohistochemical similarities between the Yucatan hairless micropig (HMP) skin and that of humans. Hairless micropig skin surface was composed of complex intersecting furrows that created geometric patterns remarkably similar to human skin surface glyphics. The dermal--epidermal interface consisted of undulant downgrowths that interdigitated with dermal papillae. Hairless micropig epidermis contained two morphologically distinct populations of basal keratinocytes (serrated and nonserrated). Similar heterogeneity has been seen only in human epidermis and primate palmar epidermis. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the HMP epidermis is reactive with monoclonal and polyclonal antisera to keratin proteins. Melanocytes reactive with antisera to S-100 protein, as in human skin, also were observed in HMP epidermis. Organization of dermal extracellular matrix, including collagen and elastic fibers, and the organization and reactivity of the microvasculature with antisera to factor VIII, were consistent with human skin. The costicosteroid-induced atrophy and subsequent rebound phenomenon after withdrawal of steroid observed in HMP skin was similar with that observed in humans. It is concluded that HMP skin approximates human skin significantly more precisely than most existing species and is an excellent model for studies of cutaneous physiology and pharmacology.\r"

In 16 cases (82.9 +/- 5.4 years old), the minority of E-NFTs were immunoreactive with beta-protein antiserum. These beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs frequently appeared in the areas having senile plaques, while they were not observed in the area lacking beta-immunoreactive senile plaques. The ultrastructure of beta-immunoreactive E-NFTs revealed that they consisted of extracellular amyloid fibrils, extracellularly located bundles of paired helical filaments, astroglial processes and degenerating neurites. These findings suggest that the beta immunoreactivity of E-NFTs comes from secondary deposition of amyloid fibrils.\r"

The effects of a single exposure of cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (BEC) and bovine pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (BSMC) to MCTP were examined. Monocrotaline pyrrole caused a dose-dependent, delayed, and progressive cell detachment and release of lactate dehydrogenase activity from monolayers of BECs but not BSMCs. Monolayers of BECs also released increased concentrations of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 degrees, the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, as the post-treatment interval increased. Progressive and marked endothelial cell hypertrophy occurred after exposure to a nominal concentration of 5 or 50 micrograms/ml of MCTP but not after 0.5 micrograms/ml. Morphologic changes in monolayers of BSMCs were minimal, even up to 2 weeks after exposure. Ultrastructurally the hypertrophic, MCTP-treated BECs had enlarged cell profiles with enlarged nuclei. The nucleoli were prominent, occasionally multiple, and had separation of granular and fibrillar components. Cytoplasmic microtubules and perinuclear intermediate filaments were prominent in some cells, as were the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. Degenerative changes were not prominent in cells that remained in the monolayer. Monocrotaline pyrrole inhibited proliferation of both cell types at concentrations (0.5 micrograms/ml) that were not cytotoxic. These findings indicate that MCTP induces direct, dose-dependent injury to cells in culture that is delayed and progressive, and the expression of this injury depends, in part, on the cell type.\r"

Histology showed a marked initial dermal and subcutaneous neutrophil infiltrate by approximately 2 hours, followed by a predominantly mononuclear infiltrate by 24 hours, which remained present for several days. Tumor necrosis factor or LiCl alone induced negligible inflammation, disappearing after 6 hours; furthermore there was never necrosis or ulceration of the overlying skin in case of single-agent application. In vitro studies showed that the combination of TNF and LiCl, but not either agent alone, was directly cytotoxic to fibroblastic cells of murine skin. No inflammatory infiltration was visible in tumors treated intratumorally or perilesionally with TNF plus LiCl, although the latter treatment resulted in a perilesional leukocyte infiltration. Furthermore the combination of TNF and LiCl had no effect on macrophage cytotoxicity to L929 tumors.\r"

  ".W": "'Very late antigen' (VLA) proteins are members of the integrin superfamily with cell-surface receptor function and are involved in the cell-cell matrix interaction. They are heterodimers with a common beta 1 chain and different alpha chains counted through VLA-1 to VLA-6. The VLA-2 complex (alpha 2/beta 1) was found to act as collagen receptor on platelets and the VLA-6 complex (alpha 6/beta 1) as laminin receptor. Using monoclonal antibodies and an indirect immunoperoxidase method, we investigated the expression of VLA-alpha 2, VLA-alpha 6, and VLA-beta 1 chains in 20 normal colonic mucosa samples, in 20 colonic adenomas, and in 96 carcinomas together with 10 accompanying liver metastases. All three proteins were expressed throughout the colonic epithelium, except for VLA-alpha 2, which was present in the cryptic gland but was absent on the mucosal surface in some cases. In general, adenomas were strongly positive for the VLA proteins but 3 of 20 cases showed focal VLA-alpha 2-negative areas. The carcinomas revealed considerable heterogeneity of VLA-alpha 2 expression; ie, 59 tumors were completely positive, 35 tumors revealed a focal loss of antigen, and 2 cases were negative. This reduced antigen expression was statistically associated with Dukes' stage C/D (P = 0.003). VLA-alpha 6 was expressed throughout in all tumors. VLA-beta 1 was found extensively expressed in 77 carcinomas, partially expressed in 17 carcinomas, and was absent in 2 carcinomas. As compared to their primary tumors, liver metastases showed roughly corresponding patterns of antigen expression. The down regulation/loss of VLA proteins in a subset of epithelial colon tumors might cause a disturbed cell-cell/cell-matrix interaction that might augment the invasive property of their cells.\r"

A similar reaction pattern was found with an antibody directed against keratin 17, although this antibody was more often found negative than keratin 14 in the pre-existing myoepithelial cells in intraductal carcinomas. Furthermore antibodies reactive with hyperproliferation-related keratins 6 and 16 were used. One of these (LL025) was completely negative in normal breast tissue and noninvasive breast carcinomas. However 10% of the invasive carcinomas were diffusely or focally positive with this latter antibody, while in 18 of 115 cases of invasive breast carcinomas studied, a basal cell phenotype was detected. A relatively high concordance was found between the carcinomas immunostaining with the basal cell and the hyperproliferation-related keratins, but not between these markers and the proliferation marker Ki-67. This supports the conclusion that basal cells in breast cancer may show extensive proliferation, and that absence of Ki-67 staining does not mean that (tumor) cells are not proliferating.\r"

The monoclonal hypothesis proposes that the stimulus for this SMC proliferation is a mutational event. Here we describe a procedure for growing human plaque smooth muscle cells (p-SMC) in culture. We show that p-SMCs derived from two patients differ from SMC cultured from normal vascular tissue in expression of the protooncogene myc. One p-SMC strain was extensively characterized; these diploid, karyotypically normal cells have a finite life span in culture. Ultrastructural examination revealed two populations, one with classic contractile SMC appearance, the other, modulated to a synthetic state. Northern blotting showed a 2- to 6-fold and a 6- to 11-fold enhanced expression of myc by p-SMC, compared to SMC derived from healthy human aorta (HA-SMC) and saphenous vein (HV-SMC), respectively. In contrast, the p-SMC and HV-SMC expressed similar levels of message for the genes N-myc, L-myc, Ha-ras, fos, sis, myb, LDL receptor, EGF receptor, IGF I receptor, IGF II, and HMG CoA reductase. Finally, although p-SMCs are not tumorigenic, DNA isolated from these cells is positive in the transfection-nude mouse tumor assay. Myc, however, does not appear to be the transforming gene because no newly introduced human myc gene was detected in the p-SMC-associated nude mouse tumor. Thus human atherosclerotic p-SMCs possess both an activated myc gene and a transforming gene that is retained throughout many cell passages.\r"

Elective diagnostic laparoscopy is a useful adjunct to many other diagnostic modalities such as, for instance, the assessment of abdominal pain, abdominal masses, fever of unknown origin, and gastrointestinal bleeding. In many other circumstances, such as the assessment of oncology cases, this modality is superior to conventional radiology because biopsy specimens may be obtained. If the procedure is correctly performed, the diagnostic yield is extremely high and the morbidity and mortality are low. The role of this important technique should not be underestimated by today's practicing surgeon.\r"

Unnecessary exploration was avoided except in one case. In the elderly high-risk patient with a poor history, abdominal examination can be noninformative. Laparoscopy can detect acute appendicitis or organ perforation. In the young female, appendicitis can be differentiated from pelvic inflammatory disease. Laparoscopy is more accurate and gives a larger latitude for decision-making than lavage. It can also be useful in the obscured problematic abdominal case.\r"

The indications are similar to those for elective traditional cholecystectomy, but selection of patients is important for success. Contraindications are currently evolving. Patients with advanced cholecystitis, abdominal sepsis, ileus, bleeding disorders, pregnancy, and morbid obesity should not undergo this procedure. The procedure requires good traditional surgical skills, as well as additional laparoscopic (and laser) skills. Operative time is slightly longer than for traditional cholecystectomy, but decreases with experience. Morbidity is low, but there is a concern about bile duct injuries. Mortality is very low (0%) and is comparable to traditional cholecystectomy (0.4%). The major advantages of laparoscopic cholecystectomy are the short hospital stay (average: 2 days) and early return to normal activity (7 days). This results in a reduction in hospital costs. Adequate training and credentialing are important processes to foster good patient outcomes.\r"

Monopolar radio frequency electricity (electrosurgery) and collimated coherent light (laser) injure tissue by the generation of heat, and in this regard are remarkably similar. The greatest differences between these sources of heat are related to predictability of injury, selective absorption of free beam laser energy, ability to coagulate, and cost. Although there are no prospective data yet available to answer the question of superiority, it appears that electrosurgical dissection may be faster and is generally less costly. Laser dissection may be more precise. In difficult cases, hemostasis appears to be superior with electrosurgery.\r"

As in the open, standard operation, the crucial step is the dissection of the cystic pedicle containing the respective duct, artery, and lymph node. All the groups involved in laparoscopic cholecystectomy have to date opted for the use of applicators to clip the cystic duct and artery. As there are intrinsic disadvantages to the use of clips, we report an alternative method which involves ligation of these structures using the Roeder slip knot with dry chromic catgut. The safety margin of this knot was initially tested in vitro using a Instrom tensiometer. Under these experimental conditions, the Roeder slip knot tied with #0 dry chromic catgut ligature started to yield at 225 g. As the estimated tension on the cystic duct (1.1 g) and a 4-mm artery (6.0 g) in vivo is well below this figure, the safety of this knot with dry catgut in clinical practice is beyond question. The technique of Roeder slip-loop knotting was used to ligate the cystic artery and duct in a consecutive series of 80 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This clinical experience has confirmed its safety and ease of execution. The particular advantages of Roeder loop ligation include execution through a 5.5-mm cannula and accurate placement of the knot. In addition, the technique requires less length of mobilized duct and artery, which is an important practical consideration in patients with a fibrosed gallbladder and shortened cystic pedicle.\r"

There is a difference between open and closed laparoscopic cholecystectomy. It is more difficult to locate the common bile duct during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During this procedure, the anatomy is distorted due to the extreme traction at the infundibulum. With a short cystic duct, the common bile duct can become \"tented\" and simulate the appearance of the cystic duct. Ductal injuries may be avoided by knowing where the clips should be placed in relation to the ductal system and by obtaining information about the intact display of the distal and proximal ductal system. The image can be observed immediately by using a modern fluoroscopic system, and permanent documentation can be obtained. We attempted intraoperative cholangiography in 415 cases and were successful in 90%. We strongly recommend the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography.\r"

All had a long history of chronic duodenal ulcer with a mean duration of symptoms of 3.8 years. The mean length of the operation was 60 minutes (range: 55 to 110 minutes). There was no morbidity, and all patients were discharged after 5 days. The acid secretion tests under basal conditions and under insulin stimulation preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively showed a mean decrease in the basal output of 79.3% and a mean decrease of 83.04% in the maximal output. The fibroscopic control at the second postoperative month showed a complete healing of the ulcer in nine patients and a residual ulcer scar in one. No patients had any abdominal complaints. Right truncal vagotomy and anterior lesser curve seromyotomy by videocoelioscopy is an efficient and elegant method of treating chronic duodenal ulcer, but it needs thorough experimental practice.\r"

The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities.\r"

Acute cholecystitis has been considered to be a relative or absolute contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. After gaining extensive experience in laparoscopic biliary tract surgery, this procedure was attempted in 15 patients with acute cholecystitis. All patients were operated on within 72 hours of admission. In five patients, the laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open laparotomy; in one patient, a localized abscess was found, and in the other four patients, extensive inflammation and edema precluded a safe dissection of the vascular and ductal structures. Laparoscopic cholangiography was performed in 14 patients and proved valuable in demonstrating the ductal anatomy. Patients were discharged an average of 2.7 days after the laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be safely performed by experienced surgeons in patients with acute cholecystitis. To ensure a low complication rate, a low threshold for converting the procedure to an open laparotomy must be maintained if the ductal and vascular anatomy cannot be safely demonstrated.\r"

All of these may also be seen with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The incidence of their occurrence, however, may vary. It remains too early to evaluate the complication rates from this new procedure, as reports of large series are just beginning to emerge. Early reports are encouraging but caution that bile duct injury, hemorrhage, and even death may occur. Early enthusiasm for this new method must be tempered with care in its practice if complication rates are to be maintained at an acceptable level and the procedure is to earn a permanent place in the armamentarium of the surgeon.\r"

It has not been demonstrated, however, that patients actually return to work after laparoscopic cholecystectomy faster than the traditional 4- to 6-week absence from work after a standard open procedure. A survey of 104 French and 84 American patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed that postoperative discomfort was completely resolved in 2 weeks in 73% of French and 93% of American patients. All but 11 French and 5 American patients were back to normal home activities by 2 weeks after the operation. Of the 35 American and 40 French patients who had professional activity outside the home, 63% and 25%, respectively, returned to work within 14 days. Five (14%) of the American patients and 12 (30%) of the French patients returned to work 4 weeks or more after the operation. The amount of physical activity on the job correlated with the period off work, but, interestingly, at least six patients with very hard physical activity at work (including construction workers) were able to return to full work activity within 1 week. These data suggest that early return to work is possible and that pain resolves quickly after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The economic benefit of having patients back on the job quickly, however, may be less than expected until cultural norms change with regard to leave of absence after major surgery.\r"

Laparoscopic surgery involves techniques different from those learned during general surgery residency training. Therefore, until such techniques are regularly included in general surgery residency programs, additional training for and granting of separate privileges in laparoscopic surgery are appropriate. Adequate training for surgeons already experienced in abdominal and biliary tract surgery can be acquired through a preceptorship in diagnostic laparoscopy, attending a course in laparoscopic surgery that includes both didactic instruction and live animal experience, assisting with the procedures in humans, and being proctored and certified as competent by an experienced general surgeon.\r"

Many abdominal and thoracic procedures are being adapted to the minimal access approach. Developmental requirements include improvements in light delivery systems; three-dimensional television imaging; better surgical instrumentation; ultrasound probes for internal and external scanning; stapling devices; and tunable, portable solid-state diode lasers.

Patients who had no history of neurologic or psychiatric illness were randomly assigned to receive either a thiopental infusion or a saline placebo infusion beginning with the administration of heparin and ending just after aortic decannulation. The patients received an opioid-relaxant anesthetic administered by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in this investigation and who was blinded to the test infusion. One of the investigators infused either saline or thiopental to produce an isoelectric electroencephalogram with 30-45 s between bursts. Standardized neurologic examinations were performed preoperatively and on the 2nd and 5th postoperative days by one of the blinded investigators. The group of patients receiving thiopental required a longer time for awakening (6.4 +/- 3.9 vs. 4.0 +/- 2.4 h, mean +/- SD, P less than 0.05) and for tracheal extubation (22.4 +/- 18.4 vs. 17.4 +/- 9.6 h, P less than 0.05), and a greater number of these patients were lethargic on the 2nd postoperative day. More patients receiving thiopental required vasoconstrictors during the thiopental loading and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) periods, while a greater number of patients receiving placebo required vasodilators. A greater number of patients receiving thiopental required inotropic drugs during separation from CPB. Despite the above differences, only 2 of the 151 patients in the placebo group (1.3%) and 5 of the 149 patients in the thiopental group (3.3%) experienced strokes (P = 0.2535).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The neuromuscular effects of desflurane administered alone were studied in ten healthy human volunteers aged 20-27 yr. Also, the dose-response relationships of pancuronium and succinylcholine in surgical patients during anesthesia with desflurane (n = 13) were compared to those during isoflurane anesthesia (n = 14). In the volunteers, we measured the mechanical response of the adductor pollicis muscle to stimulation of the ulnar nerve in a train-of-four (TOF) sequence at 2 Hz and at tetanic frequencies of 50, 100, and 200 Hz, each administered for 5 s. Amplitudes of the first response (T1) in each TOF sequence and the ratios of the fourth TOF response (T4) to the first were similar at 3, 6, and 9% desflurane and decreased significantly only at 12% (P less than 0.05). Desflurane concentrations of 3-12% caused tetanic fade (greater than 10% decrement in amplitude) at 50, 100, and 200 Hz. The addition of N2O and the duration of anesthetic exposure did not alter desflurane's neuromuscular effects. The only neuromuscular variable influenced by CO2 was T1 amplitude, which decreased as arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) increased. The doses of pancuronium that depressed T1 amplitude by 50% (ED50) were similar during anesthesia with 1.25 MAC desflurane, 10.5 +/- 2.8 micrograms/kg (mean +/- SD) and 1.25 MAC isoflurane, 12.3 +/- 5.0 micrograms/kg. The ED50 doses of succinylcholine were similar during anesthesia with desflurane 132 +/- 76 micrograms/kg and isoflurane 123 +/- 36 micrograms/kg. We conclude that desflurane significantly depresses neuromuscular function and augments the action of pancuronium and succinylcholine to a degree similar to that of isoflurane.\r"

Although anesthetic conditions were similar during operations in the two treatment groups, significant differences were noted in the recovery profiles as measured by elimination kinetics, psychometric testing, and visual analog scales (to assess subjective feelings). The time required for the end-tidal concentration to decrease by 50% was 2.5 +/- 0.8 min for desflurane vs. 9.5 +/- 3.4 min for isoflurane (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]). Times to awakening and ability to follow simple commands were significantly shorter after desflurane than after isoflurane (5.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 10.2 +/- 7.7 min 6.5 +/- 2.3 min vs. 11.1 +/- 7.9 min, respectively). Postoperatively, patients who received desflurane exhibited less impairment of cognitive function (as measured using the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test) than did those who received isoflurane. Furthermore, visual analog scores indicated that patients receiving desflurane experienced significantly less discomfort (pain), drowsiness, fatigue, clumsiness, and confusion in the early postoperative period. We conclude that desflurane may offer clinical advantages over isoflurane when used for maintenance of anesthesia during outpatient surgical procedures.\r"

Twenty-eight patients were randomly divided into four groups. Group 1 received isoflurane 0.65 MAC; group 2, desflurane 0.65 MAC; group 3, isoflurane 1.25 MAC; and group 4, desflurane 1.25 MAC. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental, and N2O 60% was added to the volatile agent. Mean anesthetic exposure times (min [mean +/- SD]) were 108 +/- 49 in group 1, 132 +/- 46 in group 2, 147 +/- 74 in group 3, and 166 +/- 71 in group 4, with no significant differences between groups. The times from discontinuation of anesthetic gases until patients opened their eyes and squeezed the investigator's hand in response to a command were averaged and recorded as \"emergence time.\" Emergence time was significantly less with desflurane than with isoflurane given at the same MAC. Patients receiving isoflurane 0.65 MAC responded to commands 15.6 +/- 4.3 min after discontinuation of the anesthetic; patients in the desflurane 0.65 MAC group responded in 8.8 +/- 2.7 min (P less than 0.01). Emergence time for isoflurane 1.25 MAC was 30.0 +/- 11.0 min; for desflurane 1.25 MAC it was 16.1 +/- 6.0 min (P less than 0.05). Our results confirm that emergence from desflurane anesthesia is more rapid than from isoflurane.\r"

  ".W": "Desflurane (formerly I-653) is a new inhalaticnal anesthetic with a promising pharmacokinetic profile that includes low solubility in blood and tissue, including fat. Since its lipid solubility is less than that of other volatile agents, it may have lower potency. Low solubility would be expected to increase the rate at which alveolar concentration approaches inspired concentration during induction as well as to increase the rate of elimination of desflurane from blood at emergence. We determined the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of desflurane in 44 unpremedicated ASA physical status 1 or 2 patients undergoing elective surgery. We prospectively studied four patient groups distinguished by age and anesthetic regimen: 18-30 versus 31-65 yr and desflurane in 60% N2O/40% O2 versus desflurane in O2. Anesthesia was induced with desflurane or desflurane in 60% N2O/40% O2. MAC was determined by a modification of Dixon's up-and-down method with increments of 0.5% desflurane. The MAC of desflurane in O2 was 7.25 +/- 0.0 (mean +/- SD) in the 18-30-yr age group, and 6.0 +/- 0.29 in the 31-65-yr group; the addition of 60% N2O reduced the MAC to 4.0 +/- 0.29 and 2.83 +/- 0.58, respectively. The median time from discontinuation of desflurane to an appropriate response to commands was 5.25 min. Desflurane appears to be a mild airway irritant but was well tolerated by all patients.\r"

Accordingly, we examined the EEG in 12 healthy, young male volunteers during desflurane anesthesia. Each subject had a baseline recording and then steady-state exposure to 6, 9, and 12% (0.83, 1.24, and 1.66 MAC) desflurane in O2 alone, and to 3, 6, and 9% desflurane in O2 with 60% N2O. The sequence of doses and the presence of N2O were randomized. We used mechanical ventilation to maintain normocapnia at each dose level. We also tested the effects of hypercapnia secondary to spontaneous ventilation. Additionally, at 1.24 MAC, subjects' lungs were hyperventilated to a PCO2 of 25.8 +/- 0.7 mmHg and exposed to rhythmic, loud clapping to attempt to provoke excitatory phenomena. Finally, after at least 6 h exposure to desflurane, we repeated measurements at 0.83 and 1.66 MAC to assess possible tolerance. Four channels of EEG were monitored visually, and at each dose, a quantitative EEG analysis was performed. Desflurane produced EEG changes comparable to those observed with equipotent levels of isoflurane. No epileptiform activity was seen. Desflurane significantly suppressed EEG activity; prominent burst suppression was seen at 1.24 MAC and higher. Substitution of N2O for 0.42 MAC desflurane reduced the degree of EEG suppression relative to the equipotent administration of desflurane and O2. Quantitative EEG measures for the early doses and for the later, repeated exposures did not differ.\r"

We prospectively evaluated the clinical utility of the PA Watch Catheter in 25 patients after cardiac surgery by hourly measurements of pulmonary artery (distal lumen), right ventricular (middle lumen), and central venous (proximal lumen) pressures. The catheter was considered to be in the proper position when the middle lumen port, located 10 cm from the tip, transmitted a right ventricular pressure waveform. Satisfactory initial catheter placement was obtained in 24 of 25 patients. During the 28.4 +/- 1.8 h of postoperative monitoring, clinically unsuspected distal catheter migration, indicated by the presence of a pulmonary artery pressure waveform in the middle lumen port, occurred in 12 of the 25 patients (48%). In these patients, 20 episodes occurred and required catheter withdrawal distances of 1.8 +/- 0.3 cm (range 1-6 cm). The PA Watch Catheter proved to be a useful indicator of unsuspected distal catheter migration in the postoperative period. The PA Watch Catheter allows assessment of catheter tip placement in the proximal pulmonary artery and may decrease catheter-induced complications.\r"

  ".W": "Several groups of investigators have reported that the plasma concentrations of laudanosine, a metabolite of atracurium, are high immediately after administration of atracurium and thereafter decline. Such a time profile of a metabolite in plasma is very unusual. The authors describe a model of atracurium decay and laudanosine disposition that satisfactorily explains these data. The model reveals the following: 1) each atracurium molecule is degraded into two of laudanosine; 2) the generation of laudanosine occurs through two processes--a rapid one, involving approximately 31% of the atracurium dose and proceeding with a half-life of 0.25 min, and a slower one, involving the residual 69% and proceeding with a half-life of 51 min; 3) atracurium degradation by Hofmann elimination proceeds in the central and the noncentral compartments; 4) laudanosine formed from atracurium gains access to its central compartment and disappears from plasma in a biexponential pattern; 5) in cirrhotic patients, only 18% of the atracurium dose is degraded rapidly and laudanosine is disposed of more slowly. The authors propose that the rapid degradation of atracurium in plasma proceeds through a nucleophilic substitution reaction, with plasma nucleophiles substituting for the laudanosine moiety in atracurium. Because both laudanosine moieties in atracurium are required to establish and sustain plasma concentrations of laudanosine, excretion of atracurium or its degradation through pathways not generating laudanosine must be small.\r"

To compare these techniques, 17 patients underwent either phenol lumbar sympathetic blocks (n = 9) or radiofrequency denervation (n = 8). Duration of sympathetic block was followed by a sweat test and temperature measurements. Results indicate that 89% of patients in the phenol group showed signs of sympathetic blockade after 8 weeks, as compared to 12% in the radiofrequency group (P less than 0.05). Although the incidence of post sympathetic neuralgia appears to be less with radiofrequency denervation, further refinement of needle placement to ensure complete lesioning of the sympathetic chain will be required before the technique can offer advantages over current phenol techniques.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery continue to be significant problems. To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and prognostic importance of postoperative myocardial ischemia after CABG surgery, the authors monitored 50 patients continuously for 10 perioperative days with the use of two-lead electrocardiography (ECG). ECG changes consistent with ischemia were defined as a reversible ST depression of 1 mm or greater or an elevation of 2 mm or greater from baseline, lasting at least 1 min. Baseline was adjusted for positional changes and temporal drift. All episodes were verified, with the use of the ECG monitor printout (ECG complexes), by two independent blinded investigators. Clinical care was not controlled by study protocol, and clinicians were unaware of the research data collected. Twenty-six of 50 patients (52%) had 207 episodes of perioperative ischemia (3,409 ischemic minutes). Postoperatively, ischemia developed in 48% of patients, compared with 12% preoperatively and 10% intraoperatively before bypass. Postoperative ischemia was most common in the early period (postoperative days [PODs] 0-2; 38% of patients), peaking during the first 2 h after revascularization, and less common during the late postoperative period (PODs 3-7; 24% of patients). Almost all (120 of 122; 98%) postoperative episodes (after tracheal extubation) were asymptomatic: only 9 of 70 (13%) early episodes were detected by clinical ECG monitoring. Postoperative ischemia did not appear to be related to acute changes in myocardial oxygen demand: only 39% of the postoperative episodes were preceded by a greater than 20% increase in heart rate. However, tachycardia persisted throughout the postoperative week (22-33% of all heart rates greater than 100 beats per min), and patients with postoperative ischemia (POD 0) more frequently had tachycardia (median 43% vs. 12% of the time; P less than 0.01). Five adverse cardiac outcomes occurred on the day of surgery; all five were preceded by postoperative ischemia, three by intraoperative ischemia before bypass, and none by preoperative ischemia. Patients with late postoperative ischemia did not have an adverse cardiac outcome. The authors conclude the following: 1) ischemia is more prevalent postoperatively than preoperatively or intraoperatively before bypass; 2) the incidence of postoperative ischemia peaks shortly after revascularization, during which time it is symptomatically silent, difficult to detect, and related to adverse cardiac outcome; 3) late postoperative ischemia also is silent, but it is less prevalent and not associated with in-hospital adverse cardiac outcome; and 4) a relationship between ischemia and persistently elevated postoperative heart rate may exist and warrants additional investigation.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six anesthetized patients (ASA physical status 1 or 2) undergoing elective surgery were monitored (isometric adductor pollicis mechanical activity) to detect the effects of discontinuing isoflurane anesthesia upon the reversal of vecuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade. Neuromuscular blockade was produced by vecuronium 100 micrograms/kg and additional doses of 20 micrograms/kg until completion of surgery. The patients were randomly divided into three groups: in the control group (n = 12), only fentanyl/N2O was given; in the \"isostable\" group (n = 12), isoflurane at an end-tidal concentration of 1.25% was maintained throughout anesthesia; in the \"isostop\" group (n = 12), isoflurane 1.25% was discontinued before neostigmine administration. In all groups, paralysis was antagonized with 15 micrograms/kg intravenous (iv) atropine and 40 micrograms/kg iv neostigmine when the twitch height (0.1 Hz) had regained 25% of its control value. The measured parameters were twitch height, train-of-four, and 50--100-Hz tetanic fade. No significant differences were found among the three groups with respect to the final twitch heights and tetanic fades at 50 Hz. In the isostable group, final mean train-of-four was significantly less (75%) than in the other patients (88%) (P less than 0.01). Mean tetanic fade at 100 Hz was significantly less in the isostable group (31%) than in the isostop group (57%) (P less than 0.01) and control group (84%) (P less than 0.01). We conclude that discontinuing isoflurane anesthesia for 15 min improves the reversal of a vecuronium paralysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Anesthesia was induced and maintained with midazolam, thiopental, and fentanyl. We administered 70% N2O for 30 min, and then administered 2% desflurane, 0.4% isoflurane, and 0.2% halothane concurrently with 65% N2O for 30 min. Inspired, end-tidal, and mixed-expired gas samples were collected during administration of the volatile agents and for 5-7 days of elimination. The right arm and hand of each subject was enclosed in a sealed glass cylinder having a port at each end, one for sampling and both for flushing with N2 after anesthetic administration and every 15 min thereafter. We sampled gases from the cylinder during administration and for the 150 min of elimination and analyzed their anesthetic concentrations by gas chromatography. The surface area of the enclosed portion of the arm was measured, and the total body surface area was calculated. All values were normalized to (i.e., divided by) the end-tidal (alveolar) concentration at the end of administration. During administration, percutaneous loss of halothane was 3.5 times that of desflurane and 2 times that of isoflurane. During elimination, the loss of halothane was 6 times and 2 times greater than the loss of desflurane and isoflurane, respectively. Percutaneous loss of halothane significantly exceeded that of isoflurane. The elimination values included an estimate of elimination after 150 min. The percutaneous loss of each anesthetic was 2- to 3-fold greater during elimination than administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The low solubility of desflurane in blood and tissues suggests that the partial pressures of this agent in blood and tissues should approach the inspired partial pressure more rapidly than would the blood and tissue partial pressures of other potent inhaled anesthetics. We tested this prediction, comparing the pharmacokinetics of desflurane with those of isoflurane, halothane, and nitrous oxide in eight volunteers. We measured the rate at which the alveolar (endtidal) (FA) concentration of nitrous oxide increased towards an inspired (FI) concentration of 65-70%, and then measured the concurrent increase in FA and mixed expired concentrations (FM) of desflurane, isoflurane, and halothane at respective FI values of 2.0%, 0.4%, 0.2%. Minute ventilation (VE) was measured concurrently with the measurements of anesthetic concentrations. The potent vapors were administered for 30 min; administration of nitrous oxide continued throughout the period of anesthesia. For the potent agents, we also measured VE, FA, and FM for 5-7 days of elimination. We used FA/FI and FA/FA0 (FA0 = the last FA during the administration of each anesthetic) to define the rate of increase of anesthetic in the lungs and the rate of elimination of anesthetic, respectively. FA/FI values at 30 min of administration were: (mean +/- SD) nitrous oxide 0.99 +/- 0.01, desflurane 0.90 +/- 0.01, isoflurane 0.73 +/- 0.03, and halothane 0.58 +/- 0.04. FA/FA0 values after 5 min of elimination were: desflurane 0.14 +/- 0.02, isoflurane 0.22 +/- 0.02, and halothane 0.25 +/- 0.02. Recovery (volume of anesthetic recovered during elimination per volume taken up) of desflurane (105 +/- 25%) equalled recovery of isoflurane (102 +/- 13%) and exceeded recovery of halothane (64 +/- 9%). Time constants for a five-compartment mammillary model for halothane and isoflurane differed for the lungs, fat group, and hepatic metabolism, and exceeded those for desflurane for all compartments. In summary, we found that FA/FI of desflurane increases more rapidly and that FA/FA0 decreases more rapidly in humans than do these variables with other available potent anesthetics. We also found that desflurane resists biodegradation in humans and so may have little or no toxic potential.\r"

This investigation was designed to investigate the central nervous system site of action responsible for this effect. Six adult cats were anesthetized with halothane (0.8-1%) in a mixture of 50% N2O in O2. A recording electrode was placed stereotactically in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of thalamus (VPL), and a ball electrode was placed over the surface of the hind limb region of primary sensory cortex. Somatosensory evoked potentials in response to stimulation of tibial nerve thus were simultaneously recorded from cerebral cortex and VPL. The effect of two doses (1 and 3 mg.kg-1) of etomidate given 2 h apart on the latency and amplitude of cortical (positive wave at 15 ms) and thalamic (positive deflection at 10 ms, followed by negative deflection at 17 ms) evoked potentials was studied. There was no significant effect of etomidate on either latency or amplitude of early, positive thalamic potentials. Both doses of etomidate caused a significant increase in the latency and amplitude of cortical potentials. The mean latency of cortical potential increased by 1.72 ms (11%) after the 1 mg.kg-1 dose and 2.3 ms (15.9%) after the 3 mg.kg-1 dose. The maximum mean increase in the amplitude of cortical potentials was 14.3 microV (mean increase 78%, range 28-241%) after 1 mg.kg-1 and 19.1 microV (mean increase 112%, range 28-202%) after 3 mg.kg-1.

During a steady-state baseline period under 1 MAC desflurane (7.2%), the following were measured or derived: arterial, pulmonary artery, and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures; arterial, mixed venous, and sagittal sinus blood gases; cardiac index and cerebral blood flow (CBF); whole-body and cerebral O2 consumption; systemic and cerebral vascular resistance; intracranial pressure; and blood glucose and lactate concentrations. After the baseline period, hypotension to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 mmHg was produced by 15.5% (2.2 MAC), and hypotension to an MAP of 40 mmHg was produced by 17.1% (2.4 MAC) for 1 h. During this hypotensive period all measurements were taken at 5- or 15-min intervals. At the end of the hypotensive period, brain biopsy specimens were taken for measurement of cerebral concentrations of ATP, phosphocreatine, and lactate to determine whether there was any metabolic evidence of cerebral ischemia. Desflurane-induced hypotension produced a significant, 40-50% decrease in cardiac index with a significant change in systemic vascular resistance at the lower blood pressure, but produced little change in heart rate. Even though whole-body O2 consumption did not decrease, adequate peripheral perfusion was maintained with the lower cardiac output, as evidenced by lack of accumulation of blood lactate. Induced hypotension caused a significant, 50 (at MAP = 50 mmHg) to 64% (at MAP = 40 mmHg) decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure, accompanied by a significant, 36 (at MAP = 50 mmHg) to 60% (at MAP = 40 mmHg) decrease in CBF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The right atrium was paced at 3-7 Hz (n = 10) to examine rate-dependent effects on AVCT, Wenckebach's periodicity, and ventricular response rates with atrioventricular (AV) block. Isovolumetric left ventricular pressure (LVP) was measured with a saline-filled balloon placed through the mitral valve. Hearts were perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Ringer's solution at 55 mmHg equilibrated with low or high concentrations of isoflurane (0.7 and 1.5%), halothane (0.5 and 1%), or enflurane (1.1 and 2.2%). Hearts were also perfused with a low or high concentration of diltiazem (75 and 150 ng/ml) alone and during anesthetic exposure. Significant findings of combined exposure were as follows: 1) the low isoflurane, halothane, or enflurane concentration plus a low or high diltiazem concentration decreased LVP compared with control and diltiazem alone; low isoflurane plus the high diltiazem concentration decreased LVP more than isoflurane alone.

Diltiazem plus halothane or enflurane decreased LVP more than diltiazem plus isoflurane. 2) Diltiazem plus low or high isoflurane, halothane, or enflurane concentrations decreased spontaneous atrial rate from control and the agents alone, except the high isoflurane concentration plus the low diltiazem concentration was not greater than that of isoflurane alone. Diltiazem plus halothane or enflurane decreased atrial rate more than diltiazem plus isoflurane. 3) Low and high diltiazem concentration plus low isoflurane, halothane, or enflurane concentrations did not prolong AVCT more than the individual agents alone, but low or high diltiazem plus high isoflurane, halothane, or enflurane concentrations increased AVCT more than each anesthetic alone. In nonpaced hearts, AV block occurred only with high diltiazem plus low enflurane (23%) concentrations and the high enflurane concentration (31%). 4) In hearts paced at 5 and 6 Hz, AVCT increased above controls during a low or high concentrations of diltiazem, during enflurane, and during the low or high concentration of diltiazem plus enflurane; AVCT increased more with the low concentration of diltiazem plus enflurane than with the low diltiazem concentration alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The magnitude of the release induced by halothane was greater for hepatocytes prepared from animals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) than for those from normal swine. Two different methods were used to ascertain the release of Ca2+ induced by halothane: 1) the release of 45Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial stores of saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes was measured; and 2) changes in luminescence from intact hepatocytes loaded with the Ca2(+)-sensitive photoprotein aequorin were recorded. It was also observed that, although 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3), guanosine-5-triphosphate, and arachidonic acid all induced a significant release of 45Ca2+ from permeabilized swine hepatocytes, only the quantities of 45Ca2+ released by IP3 were significantly greater for the hepatocytes prepared from the animals susceptible to MH. These data indicate an abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in hepatocytes isolated from swine susceptible to MH, which supports the hypothesis that membrane systems from multiple organs may be affected in this genetic disorder.\r"

  ".W": "The systemic and coronary hemodynamic effects of desflurane were compared to those of isoflurane, halothane, and enflurane in chronically instrumented dogs. Since autonomic nervous system function may significantly influence the hemodynamic actions of anesthetics in vivo, a series of experiments also was performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Eight groups comprising a total of 80 experiments were performed on 10 dogs instrumented for measurement of aortic and left ventricular pressure, the peak rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt), subendocardial segment length, coronary blood flow velocity, and cardiac output. Systemic and coronary hemodynamics were recorded in the conscious state and after 30 min equilibration at 1.25 and 1.75 MAC desflurane, isoflurane, halothane, and enflurane. Desflurane (+79 +/- 12% change from control) produced greater increases in heart rate than did halothane (+44 +/- 12% change from control) or enflurane (+44 +/- 9% change from control) at 1.75 MAC. Desflurane preserved mean arterial pressure to a greater degree than did equianesthetic concentrations of isoflurane. This result was attributed to a smaller effect on peripheral vascular resistance as compared to isoflurane and greater preservation of myocardial contractility as evaluated by peak positive left ventricular dP/dt and the rate of increase of ventricular pressure at 50 mmHg (dP/dt50) compared to other volatile anesthetics. Increases in diastolic coronary blood flow velocity (+19 +/- 6 and +35 +/- 12% change from control at 1.75 MAC, respectively) and concomitant decreases in diastolic coronary vascular resistance (-41 +/- 12 and -58 +/- 6% change from control at 1.75 MAC, respectively) were produced by desflurane and isoflurane. In the presence of autonomic nervous system blockade, the actions of desflurane and isoflurane were nearly identical with the exception of coronary vasodilation. After autonomic nervous system blockade, isoflurane increased coronary blood flow velocity, but desflurane did not. Furthermore, both desflurane and isoflurane continued to produce less depression of myocardial contractility than did halothane and enflurane. In summary, at equianesthetic concentrations, desflurane and isoflurane produced similar hemodynamic effects; however, in the absence of drugs that inhibit autonomic reflexes, desflurane had less negative inotropic activity and produced less decrease in arterial pressure. The coronary vasodilator actions of desflurane and isoflurane within the limitations of this model were not similar. When the increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product produced by desflurane were prevented in dogs with autonomic nervous system blockade, desflurane produced no change in coronary blood flow velocity.\r"

However, its hemodynamic effects remain unknown. The authors therefore investigated the effects in chronically instrumented conscious dogs (n = 8) that were randomly given hydroxocobalamin (20, 70, and 140 mg.kg-1) or saline. Determination of peak cobalt plasma concentrations showed that 20 and 70 mg.kg-1 hydroxocobalamin correspond to \"therapeutic doses,\" whereas 140 mg.kg-1 corresponds to a supratherapeutic dose. Hydroxocobalamin did not modify heart rate, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic pressure, and PR and QT intervals, regardless of the dose administered. The largest dose (140 mg.kg-1) induced a decrease in the maximum increase of LV pressure (-7 +/- 3%; P less than 0.05), maximum aortic blood flow acceleration (-17 +/- 5%; P less than 0.05), and cardiac output (-19 +/- 6%; P less than 0.05), whereas systemic resistance increased (+41 +/- 9%; P less than 0.05). In six other dogs, local administration of hydroxocobalamin (0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 mg.kg-1.min-1) confirmed that, in large doses, this drug has direct vasoconstrictor properties affecting both conductance (decrease in iliac artery diameter: -2.5 +/- 0.8%) and resistance (decrease in iliac artery blood flow: -19.5 +/- 3.4%) vessels. Thus, hydroxocobalamin should be a safe cyanide antidote, considering the lack of hemodynamic effects within the therapeutic range of doses.\r"

The authors' aims were 1) to examine if amrinone produces coronary artery vasodilation through an increase in metabolic demand or through a direct vasodilatory effect or through both and 2) to test if amrinone attenuates cardiac depression and enhances coronary artery vasodilation produced with exposure to isoflurane. The effects of these drugs were examined in 11 isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. Variables measured were: heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), isovolumetric peak left ventricular pressure (LVP), coronary flow, percent O2 extraction, myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2), and the ratio of O2 delivery (DO2) to MVO2. Each heart was exposed for 10-min periods to 10, 50, 100, and 500 microM amrinone alone, and to 0.5 or 1% isoflurane before, during, and after amrinone. Initial control values were: heart rate 216 +/- 5 beats per min; AVCT 56 +/- 1 ms; peak LVP 86 +/- 3 mmHg; coronary flow 6.3 +/- 0.3 ml.min-1.g-1 (11.4 +/- 0.7 ml.min-1.g-1 with adenosine bolus), percent O2 extraction 52 +/- 3%; DO2 107 +/- 3 microliters.min-1.g-1; MVO2 56 +/- 4 microliters.min-1.g-1; and DO2/MVO2 1.75 +/- 0.08.

Administration of the two anesthetics, was randomized, as was the order of the concentrations administered. Each dog was studied awake and at 1.2, 1.4, 1.75, and 2.0 MAC of each anesthetic on different days.

After anesthetizing animals by intramuscular and intravenous injection of methohexital and inhalation of 70% nitrous oxide, intravenous and intraarterial catheters were inserted and a tracheostomy and craniotomy performed. Ventilation was controlled to maintain arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) from between 35 and 45 mmHg. A 2-2.5-cm diameter circle of dura was exposed, over which a 0.9 x 1.0-cm elliptical surface coil was placed. Cerebral anesthetic concentrations (CC) were estimated from spectra acquired on a 4.7-Tesla spectrometer. Alveolar uptake and elimination also were assessed, using inspired (FI) and end-tidal (denoted FA0 at the end of administration) concentrations measured by gas chromatography. After baseline spectra were obtained, volatile agents were administered for 30 min, followed by a 120-min period of elimination. Our findings demonstrate that cerebral uptake and elimination correlate with solubility: they are most rapid for desflurane, next most rapid for isoflurane, and least rapid for halothane. During administration, cerebral uptake of desflurane (CC/FI = 0.690 +/- 0.049 at 9 min) was approximately 1.7 times faster than isoflurane (CC/FI = 0.691 +/- 0.020 at 15 min) and 3 times faster than halothane (CC/FI = 0.662 +/- 0.040 at 27 min). Similarly, elimination rates for desflurane (CC/FA0 = 0.238 +/- 0.015 at 9 min) were 1.7 times faster than isoflurane (CC/FA0 = 0.236 +/- 0.017 at 15 min) and three times faster than halothane (CC/FA0 = 0.212 +/- 0.033 at 27 min).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the breathing pattern during incremental exercise before and after induction of inspiratory muscle fatigue. Our aim was to determine whether induction of fatigue alters the ventilatory response to exercise and in particular whether such changes are most apparent at high levels of exercise when minute ventilation and thus inspiratory load are greatest. A group of 10 healthy subjects was studied on a cycle ergometer. Fatigue was achieved by having the subject breathe against an inspiratory threshold load that required the subject to generate 80% of the predetermined maximal mouth pressure to initiate airflow. Breathing pattern, oxygen consumption (VO2), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for respiratory effort were obtained for 3 min at rest and at 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the subject's maximal work load (Wmax) as determined by preliminary testing. Exercise was performed on two separate occasions, once immediately after induction of fatigue and the other as a control. Induction of fatigue had no effect on resting breathing and only minimal effects at the lower work loads (25 and 50% Wmax). At the higher work loads (75 and 100% Wmax) induction of fatigue significantly altered the pattern of breathing during exercise. At 75% of Wmax the respiratory frequency (f) increased from 22.5 +/- 4.4 (SD) during control to 27.0 +/- 6.7 breaths/min (p less than 0.02) following induction of fatigue; tidal volume was not significantly altered, 2.15 +/- 0.65 versus 2.24 +/- 0.74 L during control. The increase in f was due to reductions in both inspiratory and expiratory time because fractional inspiratory time remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The PTP is an estimate of the metabolic work or oxygen consumption of the respiratory muscles. We studied 10 intubated patients recovering from acute respiratory failure of various etiologies. A modified continuous flow (flow-by) CPAP of 0 and 5 cm H2O (CPAP-0 and CPAP-5, respectively), PS of 5 cm H2O (PS-5), and T-piece were applied in random order for 30 min each. In the last 5 min of the 30-min periods, we measured the esophageal pressure and transdiaphragmatic pressure-time products--PTP(es) and PTP(di), cm H2O.s/min, respectively-multiplied by respiratory frequency. Breathing pattern, total lung resistance (RL), quasi-static lung compliance (CL), intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi), end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure (Ptpexp), arterial blood gases, blood pressure, and heart rate were also measured. In comparison to T-piece, CPAP-5 decreased PTP(es) 40% (p less than 0.01) and PTP(di) 43% (p less than 0.02), whereas PS-5 decreased PTP(es) 34% (p less than 0.01) and PTP(di) 38% (p less than 0.05). The decrease in PTP(es) with CPAP-5 was associated with a significant reduction in RL, and to a less extent in PEEPi relative to airway pressure. The contribution of the decrease in PEEPi to the reduction in PTP(es) amounted to 36%. With PS-5, respiratory system mechanics and PEEPi were not significantly different compared with T-piece. With CPAP-0, PTP tended to be lower than with T-piece.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of chemoresponsiveness in determining postapneic ventilation in sleep-disordered periodic breathing, we measured ventilatory response associated with apnea-induced arterial oxygen desaturation during sleep and compared it with the awake hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) in 12 male patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Awake HVR was measured at a slight hypocapnic level (end-tidal PCO2 = 37 +/- 1 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM), and separately at a PCO2 of 45 mm Hg. During non-REM sleep both the ventilatory rate (VE) and the average respiratory frequency (f) in the ventilatory phase between apneic episodes were inversely correlated with the nadir of arterial oxygen saturation (nSaO2) produced by the preceding apneic phase in all patients (VE versus nSaO2; r = -0.74 +/- 0.03, mean +/- SEM; f versus nSaO2, r = -0.56 +/- 0.04). The average tidal volume (VT) also was correlated with nSaO2 in 10 of the patients (r = -0.56 +/- 0.05). During REM sleep VE was correlated with nSaO2 in 11 patients (r = -0.75 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.02). The response of VE to nSaO2 (delta VE/delta nSaO2) varied widely among the patients (non-REM, 0.52 to 2.16; REM, 0.29 to 1.44 L/min/%) and was significantly lower during REM than non-REM sleep (p less than 0.01). The value of delta VE/delta nSaO2 during both non-REM and REM sleep was correlated with awake HVR at an end-tidal PCO2 of 45 mm Hg (non-REM, r = 0.83, p less than 0.02; REM, r = 0.76, p less than 0.05) but not with that at the hypocapnic level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The current strategy against tuberculosis in tuberculin-negative house staff is an annual tuberculin screening test followed by chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid for a positive result. We performed a decision analysis that unequivocally concluded that the BCG vaccination leads to fewer cases of tuberculosis in this population over a 10-yr period. The BCG vaccine requires only an efficacy rate of at least 13.1% to prevent more cases of tuberculosis than the current strategy. This threshold value is independent of the annual tuberculin conversion rate. This study provides a framework, based on the best information in the literature, on which a well-informed decision regarding tuberculosis prevention can be made. Therefore, this analysis demonstrates that the BCG vaccine should be considered for tuberculin-negative house officers and medical students working in high risk areas of the United States.\r"

Cellular immune mechanisms were explored in vitro utilizing fresh and precultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to PHA, PPD, and recall antigens (SK/SD and CA). Proliferative assays were also carried out in the presence of either each patient's serum (autologous serum) or cocultured with CD3(+)-depleted adherent cells. Serum measurements of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor and synthesis of IL-2 generated by mononuclear cells stimulated with PPD and SK/SD were also performed. Patient sera were able to inhibit autologous as well as allogeneic cell responses, and a significant adherent cell suppressive effect was observed. As a whole the group of patients showed decreased blast transformation to PPD, preserved proliferative responses to other recall antigens, and a low PPD-induced generation of IL-2. Furthermore, as possible evidence of preactivated T cells, these patients demonstrated high soluble IL-2 receptor serum levels. Early compromise of specific cell-mediated immunity, including IL-2 abnormalities, may be of significance in newly diagnosed pulmonary TB.\r"

After a median follow-up of 32 months, new cases of proven pulmonary or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis occurred in 19 of the 249 HIV-seropositive women (7.6%, 3.1 cases per 100 person-years) compared with 1 of the 310 HIV-seronegative women (0.3%, 0.12 cases per 100 person-years), for a relative risk of 26 (95% confidence interval, 5 to 125). Proven pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 7 HIV-seropositive women (2.8%, 1.2 cases per 100 person-years) and 1 HIV-seronegative woman (0.3%, 0.12 cases per 100 person-years), for a relative risk of 10 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 47). We estimated that 66 cases of proven pulmonary tuberculosis in 100,000 person-years of follow-up in women of childbearing age could be attributed to HIV; this is 35% of their estimated total incidence of proven pulmonary tuberculosis. Among those followed for 2 yr, 27 (11%) of 243 HIV-seropositive women died during 2 yr of follow-up compared with none of 296 HIV-seronegative women (p less than 0.001). In HIV-seropositive women with proven or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis mortality was even higher: 5 (26%) of the 19 HIV-seropositive women with proven pulmonary or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis died during follow-up compared with 22 (10%) of the 224 HIV-seropositive women not diagnosed as having tuberculosis (relative risk 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present report focuses on the symptoms of the 14,799 adults at least 21 yr of age. The overall response rate was 83%, and missing values for individual variables ranged from 3 to 8%. The presence of home dampness and/or molds (that is, damp spots, visible mold or mildew, water damage, and flooding) was reported by 38% of respondents. The prevalence of lower respiratory symptoms (any cough, phlegm, wheeze, or wheeze with dyspnea) was increased among those reporting dampness or mold compared with those not reporting dampness or mold as follows: 38 versus 27% among current smokers, 21 versus 14% among exsmokers, and 19 versus 11% among nonsmokers (all p values less than 0.001). This association persisted after adjusting for several sociodemographic variables (including age, sex, and region) and several other exposure variables (including active and passive cigarette smoke, natural gas heating, and wood stoves). The odds ratio between symptoms and dampness was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.48 to 1.78) in the final model chosen. This association persisted despite stratification by the presence of allergies or asthma. Exposure to home dampness and mold may be a risk factor for respiratory disease in the Canadian population.\r"

In the age range of 18 to 64 yr, there were 417 participants who reported any exposure to dusts, chemicals, or gases and 1,218 who reported no exposure. Each subject completed a standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire (CNR-questionnaire). A variable proportion of participants succeeded in performing flow-volume curves, diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide, and slope of alveolar plateau of nitrogen. There was no significant difference for symptom prevalence rates between exposed and nonexposed in men and women who smoke. In nonsmoking women, those exposed showed significantly higher prevalence rates for exertional dyspnea and asthma. Regarding lung function, in exposed male smokers there was a significantly higher slope of the alveolar plateau. In exposed female nonsmokers, FEV1 and forced expiratory flows were significantly lower. Multiple logistic models in the overall group, accounting for age, smoking, and pack-years, showed that work exposure was associated significantly with higher risks for all symptoms in men (e.g., odds ratio: 2.76 for dyspnea, 2.31 for asthma, 1.69 for cough, and 1.64 for phlegm); in females, the association was significant for dyspnea (OR = 3.74) and asthma (OR = 3.29). Exposed men also had a significantly higher risk for %FEV1 or FEV1/FVC% below 70 (OR = 1.45). Our findings confirm those of the other few epidemiologic surveys in general population samples and contribute to the suggestion of a causal association between occupational exposure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\r"

The results indicate that both older and younger subjects had more difficulty satisfying the ATS acceptability and reproducibility criteria. The difficulty in satisfying the ATS reproducibility criterion, particularly in younger subjects, was in part associated with their smaller heights and lung volumes. A relatively uniform within-subject variability of FVC and FEV1 in terms of the mean differences between the largest and second largest FVC and FEV1, for all heights, was observed. In addition, unlike the ATS reproducibility criterion, when a constant 200-ml reproducibility criterion for FVC and FEV1 was used, there was no longer a significant difference between the number of reproducibility criterion failures for the 14 different height groups used. These results suggest that the ATS reproducibility criterion, based on a percentage of the FVC and FEV1, may inappropriately classify a higher percentage of subjects with smaller heights and lung volumes as having a nonreproducible test. In contrast, subjects with larger heights and lung volumes are much less likely to fail the ATS reproducibility requirement. These results emphasize the importance of following the ATS recommendation of using the reproducibility criterion only as a goal during data collection, not to classify a subject as having an invalid test.\r"

Despite extensive study, it remains unresolved whether exposures to low levels of NO2 affect airway function or reactivity. These studies were designed to assess effects of various levels and patterns of NO2 exposure on pulmonary function and airway reactivity in normal humans. Normal volunteers screened for the absence of airway hyperreactivity were exposed for 3 h in an environmental chamber to purified air or NO2, separated by at least 2 wk, according to three protocols: (1) continuous 0.60 ppm NO2, (2) baseline 0.05 ppm NO2 with intermittent peaks of 2.0 ppm, and (3) continuous 1.5 ppm NO2. Subjects exercised for 10 min of each 30 min at a level sufficient to result in a minute ventilation near 40 L/min. Pulmonary function was measured before, during, and after exposure. Airway reactivity to increasing doses of carbachol was assessed 30 min after exposure. NO2 did not directly alter pulmonary function in any of the exposure protocols. In addition, airway reactivity was not altered by continuous exposure to 0.60 ppm or intermittent peaks of 2.0 ppm NO2. In contrast, continuous exposure to 1.5 ppm NO2 resulted in a greater fall in FVC and FEV1 in response to carbachol than after exposure to air (percent decrease in FVC: 1.5% after air, 3.9% after NO2, p less than 0.01). We conclude that for subjects without airway hyperreactivity, exposure to 1.5 ppm NO2 for 3 h increases airway reactivity, whereas repeated 15-min exposures to 2.0 ppm NO2 do not alter airway reactivity.\r"

The value of an open questionnaire administered by physicians with experience in occupational asthma is unknown, however. We prospectively assessed all subjects (162) referred to our clinic because their physicians thought their asthma might be work related. The medical questionnaire included questions about the nature of the symptoms (dyspnea, wheezing, cough, and chest tightness) and the timing (worse at work or after a shift at work or improved during weekends or holidays). An initial clinical assessment was set by the physician on a scale that ranged from highly probable to probable, uncertain, unlikely, or absent. Subjects then underwent objective assessment with specific inhalation challenges (n = 72), serial monitoring of peak expiratory flow rates for periods at work and away from work (n = 29), or both (n = 61), to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of occupational asthma. A total of 75 subjects (46%) were shown to have occupational asthma. Symptoms alone (type and timing) did not provide a satisfactory differentiation between those subjects with and those without occupational asthma. For example, 66 of 75 (88%) subjects with occupational asthma said that their symptoms improved during holidays, but 66 of 87 (76%) subjects without occupational asthma experienced a similar improvement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine if this was accompanied by reciprocal changes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, we sampled BAL before and 48 h after antigen administration. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and BAL T-cell subset composition were examined in eight extrinsic asthmatics during three different weeks. During control week (CW) BAL was preformed at baseline, and PBL subsets were followed for 3 days. During placebo week (PW) a placebo inhalation was followed by a BAL at 48 h and daily PBL for 3 days. Asthmatic attacks were induced by inhalation of a relevant antigen at the start of antigen week (AW) and followed by examining the BAL at 48 h and PBL daily for 72 h. We found that BAL as a stimulus had no effect on T-cell composition of the PBL after the procedure. After induction of an asthmatic attack there was a reduction of PBL CD4+ cells from a baseline mean of 52.6% to 38.8% at 48 h (p less than 0.05). At the same time BAL CD4+ cells increased from 35.6% at PW to 47.3% in AW (p less than 0.05). These data are compatible with specific recruitment of PBL CD4+ cells into the respiratory system in atopic subjects undergoing antigenic bronchoprovocation.\r"

PBMC isolated from control groups (mild asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, normal subjects) were cultured in a similar fashion. After incubation, the culture supernatants were tested for neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) using a modified Boyden chamber technique. PBMC from patients with acute severe asthma elaborated significantly greater amounts of NCA into the culture supernatants as compared with all three control groups (p less than 0.01). The amounts of PBMC-derived NCA from the same patients after 7 days of hospital therapy and clinical improvement were reduced (p less than 0.01). A correlation was observed between the extent of reduction in spontaneous release of NCA by PBMC derived from patients with acute severe asthma and the degree of clinical improvement of their asthma (p less than 0.02). Both monocytes and lymphocytes, when cultured separately, released NCA in amounts sufficient to account for the total activity released by unfractionated PBMC. NCA in PBMC culture supernatants accumulated progressively with time, a process inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by cycloheximide. The amounts of NCA in culture supernatants did not correlate with the concentrations of histamine in lysates of the PBMC prepared just prior to culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Exposure of the respiratory mucosa to oxygen-enriched air contributes to the generation of the lung damage in both adult respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Recent work has identified the nasal submucosal gland as the source of diverse molecules important in mucous membrane host defense. We searched for the presence of antioxidant activity in nasal glandular secretions, the absence of which could possibly predispose to oxygen-induced injury. Employing a low molecular weight preparation of nasal secretions (a pooled concentrate passed over a 10,000-dalton molecular sieve), antioxidant activity capable of inhibiting both horseradish peroxidase and Fenton reagent reactions was discovered. The following lines of evidence suggest that submucosal glands are the source of this activity. (1) Antioxidant activity present in resting, baseline nasal washings is significantly increased after cholinergic stimulation either in response to topical methacholine or induced by a gustatory reflex. (2) Application of atropine reduced the antioxidant activity to baseline levels after either of the cholinergic stimuli. (3) Levels of antioxidant activity correlated very closely with the secretion of lactoferrin, a recognized product secreted solely from the serous cell of the submucosal gland. The antioxidant activity is due to novel, previously unrecognized molecules. This activity is found in nasal secretions containing molecules less than 10,000 daltons, is unaffected by N-ethyl maleimide (which inactivates glutathione, another low molecular weight antioxidant), is not associated with the capacity to reduce cytochrome c (as seen with ascorbic acid), and resides in the water soluble pool of secretions (in contrast to vitamin E, another putative antioxidant).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In asthma a temporal association exists between the late allergic reaction (LAR), the influx of granulocytes into the airway wall, and an increase in bronchial responsiveness. We therefore tested the hypothesis that activated human granulocytes constrict isolated human airways and increase their sensitivity to cholinergic stimuli. Bronchial rings were dissected from 23 lung tissue specimens collected at thoracotomy and studied isotonically in organ baths. Airways were incubated with 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 x 10(6) granulocytes from normal or atopic donors. Activation of the cells with serum-treated zymosan (STZ, 0.2 mg/ml), which itself did not alter baseline airway caliber, resulted in a bronchoconstriction proportional to the number of zymosan-activated granulocytes (ZAG) present (rs = 0.79, p less than 0.001). This contraction was reduced by about 70% with the leukotriene C4/D4 receptor antagonist FPL 55712 (11.5 microM; p less than 0.001) or with the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 microM; p less than 0.001). The scavengers of activated oxygen molecules superoxide dismutase (300 U/ml) and bovine catalase (5,000 U/ml), the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM), or the histamine (H1) receptor antagonist mepyramine (2.8 microM) had no effect. Granulocyte suspensions from atopic donors contained more eosinophils (p less than 0.001), and the magnitude of the contraction to 10 x 10(6) ZAG was related to the proportion of eosinophils (rs = 0.66, p less than 0.01). The sensitivity of the airways to methacholine was unchanged in the presence of 1, 2, or 5 x 10(6) ZAG and decreased with 10 or 20 x 10(6) ZAG (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate whether inhaled furosemide also prevents the increase in serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) observed during UNDW bronchoconstriction, we measured NCA during UNDW challenge without (control) and immediately after inhalation of furosemide (40 mg) or placebo (saline) in 10 asthmatics responsive to UNDW, in a randomized, double-blind study. NCA was assessed by measuring the maximal distance reached by neutrophils in a filter when challenged with the subject serum in a Boyden chamber (\"leading front\"). UNDW inhalation produced a significant increase in NCA in each subject. Gel filtration chromatography on S400 column indicated that the NCA released were 600 to 700 kD. Saline had no effect on bronchoconstriction nor on NCA increase induced by UNDW in nine patients. Furosemide did not change baseline FEV1, but it prevented bronchoconstriction and NCA increase in nine patients. In the whole group the maximal decrease in FEV1 after UNDW was -31.1%, SEM 4.7 after saline and -7.5%, SEM 5.2 after furosemide, p less than 0.001, the maximal increase in NCA after UNDW was +52.9%, SEM 9.2 after saline and +3.8%, SEM 3.1 after furosemide, p = 0.001. These results indicate that inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the NCA increase induced by UNDW inhalation in most asthmatic patients. This finding adds support to the suggestion that furosemide acts on mast cells.\r"

The mast cell degranulating agent compound 48/80 (10 micrograms/ml) and histamine caused reductions in phenylephrine-induced tone in endothelium-denuded rat aorta preparations mounted coaxially within epithelium-intact guinea pig tracheal tube tissue. Relaxation responses to histamine and to compound 48/80 (10 micrograms/ml) were markedly reduced in the presence of mepyramine (50 microM) or when the epithelium was removed from coaxially mounted guinea pig trachea, indicating that they were mediated via the release of EpDIF. Coaxial bioassay assemblies were also prepared using EpDIF donor tracheal tissue obtained from guinea pigs actively sensitized to ovalbumin. Subsequent challenge with ovalbumin (10(-7) to 10(-1) mg/ml) produced concentration-dependent relaxation mediated by EpDIF. Ovalbumin-induced relaxation responses were not inhibited in the presence of either mepyramine (20 and 100 microM) or SKF 104353-Z2 (10 microM) alone but were significantly reduced when both mepyramine (20 microM) and SKF 104353-Z2 (10 microM) were present. Antigen-induced relaxation was apparently mediated by EpDIF in response to mast cell-derived histamine and leukotrienes. Rat tracheal airway smooth muscle did not relax in response to EpDIF, suggesting selectivity of action on vascular smooth muscle. Vasoactive EpDIF may play a role in protecting against antigen-induced bronchoconstriction by regulating bronchial circulation flow.\r"

We found significant increases on Day 14 compared with Day 1 in the following: (1) postchallenge RL and EL in OS and OSC GPs, but not in control GPs; (2) BAL total cells and red cells in OS and OSC GPs; (3) BAL prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) thromboxane B2 (TxB2), sulfidopeptide leukotrienes (LTC4/D4/E4), and histamine in OS and OSC animals. Further, when data from all GPs were considered in distributed fashion, we noted positive linear correlations between peak postchallenge RL versus BAL concentrations of each of the following: PGD2, PGF2 alpha, TxB2, LTC4/D4/E4, leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and histamine. We found no significant differences in mediator or cellular responses between OS and OSC GPs. To verify that our method of capsaicinization resulted in TK depletion from the lungs of OSC GPs, substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (NKA) lung tissue levels were measured by ELISA in seven other animals, four treated with capsaicin using the same protocol and three treated with diluent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Repetitive bolus injections of ZAP caused reproducible alterations in lung mechanics, pulmonary hemodynamics, lung fluid and solute exchange, oxygenation, and peripheral leukocyte counts.

Infusions of endotoxin, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), or zymosan-activated plasma (ZAP) all result in the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in the lung and alterations in lung mechanics. These three interventions have strikingly different effects on airway responses to aerosol histamine: ZAP does not increase airway responsiveness, whereas endotoxin causes a greater increase in airway responsiveness than does PMA. The present histologic study examines the question of whether the pattern and severity of PMN and mast cell accumulation in large- and medium-sized airways and lung periphery could contribute to the differences in airway responsiveness to histamine. Minimally instrumented sheep were given either an infusion of endotoxin (0.5 microgram/kg over 20 min), a bolus injection of PMA (5 micrograms/kg), or repetitive boluses of autologous ZAP (5 ml). Four and a half hours later, the animals were killed, and the left lung was removed and fixed in the distended state. Three levels of the left lung were examined by light microscopy: the large hilar bronchus, a medium-sized bronchus, and peripheral lung. The number of PMNs and mast cells in the airway wall were expressed as cells/mm length of airway circumference and in the lung periphery as cells/100 alveolar profiles. Both endotoxin and PMA caused a significant 2- to 3-fold increase in number of PMNs/mm of large airway circumference, the majority of PMNs being in the blood vessels of the lamina propria and submucosa; ZAP caused only minimal PMN accumulation in the blood vessels of the submucosa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An immunoradiometric assay with an upper normal limit of 9 pg/ml was used to measure plasma TNF alpha levels (pl-TNF alpha) in 34 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in 16 patients in whom, despite the presence of risk factors, ARDS did not develop. Pl-TNF alpha was elevated in 76% of the patients with ARDS (71 +/- 104 pg/ml) and in 48% of the at-risk patients (47 +/- 73 pg/ml); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. In 13 patients studied serially from the onset (Day 0) to the fifth day of ARDS, the peak pl-TNF alpha occurred later than Day 0 in seven subjects. Although the highest pl-TNF alpha levels were found in septic patients, moderately elevated values were also observed in 56% of nonseptic subjects. We conclude that plasma TNF alpha level is not a marker of ARDS but rather of shock and sepsis. These results do not exclude a pathogenic role of TNF alpha in acute lung injury since this cytokine could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs. The large incidence of abnormally high could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs. The large incidence of abnormally high plasma TNF alpha levels raises important questions on the role of this toxic cytokine in other disorders occurring in critically ill patients.\r"

AM after recovery by bronchoalveolar lavage were selected by adherence, and then supernatants were collected after 3 or 24 h of culture. Results showed no modification of IL-1 synthesis in either group of RA patients. Spontaneous TNF production was significantly increased in Group 2 (2.5 +/- 0.5 ng/ml) as well as in Group 1 (2.4 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) compared with control subjects (0.43 +/- 0.1 ng/ml, p less than 0.001). In addition, AM from patients untreated or treated exclusively by nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs produced similar levels of TNF, whereas those receiving corticosteroids, second-line drugs (such as sulfasalazine, aurothiomalate, and methotrexate), or the combination of both therapy regimens released significantly less TNF. Interestingly, TNF was not different in both groups, but Group 2 had a markedly increased ratio of local immune complex to albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (0.47 +/- 0.12 versus 0.07 +/- 0.02 in Group 1; p less than 0.002). TNF thus appears an additional component of RA subclinical alveolitis in RA, but its prognostic value and its precise role in lung damage remain to be determined. Development of ILD requires certainly complex interactions of synergistic factors, possibly including local immune complexes detected in BAL fluids.\r"

Previous reports suggest that mediators in addition to TxA2 and PGI2 contribute to the late effects of GBS infusion (2 to 4 h), which include persistent increases in Ppa, hypoxemia, systemic hypotension, and a progressive fall in CO. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) infusion in animals produces several of the late GBS effects. We hypothesized that GBS causes increased serum TNF levels 2 to 4 h into infusion in neonatal piglets. We also postulated that the TNF inhibitor, pentoxifylline (PTF), would attenuate both GBS-induced TNF production and late GBS effects. In piglets infused with 1.25 x 10(9) cfu/kg/h of GBS, serum TNF levels (pg/ml, ELISA assay) significantly increased at 2 h (231 +/- 41) and at 4 h (1,047 +/- 290, n = 9). In piglets infused with concomitant GBS + PTF, serum TNF levels at 4 h (208 +/- 39, n = 8) were reduced compared to GBS alone piglets (p less than 0.02). Control piglets infused with 0.9% saline or PTF alone for 4 h had no detectable serum TNF (less than 35).

Intravenously administered PAF caused a dose-related increase in plasma leakage over the range 0.1 to 1 micrograms/kg. At 500 ng/kg PAF, the response was maximal in the extrapulmonary airways examined with increases in leakage above those in control animals of 312% in the larynx, 295% in the trachea, and 167% in the main bronchi. A maximal response was not achieved in the intrapulmonary airways at the doses of PAF tested: at 1 microgram/kg the increase was 206% above that in control animals. Dexamethasone, given by intraperitoneal injection 24 h and 4 h before PAF at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg on each occasion, partially inhibited leakage induced by PAF (1 microgram/kg) in all airway levels studied by 43 to 65%. At each level the tissue concentration of dye was reduced to a value that was significantly (p less than 0.05) different from either PAF or control values. We also determined whether a high dose (8 mg/kg) of dexamethasone given intraperitoneally would inhibit plasma leakage of dye induced by either PAF or antigen-challenge of sensitized rats. When given 4 h before antigen, dexamethasone completely prevented allergen-induced leakage in the airways showing significant leakage (larynx, trachea, and intrapulmonary airways). Similarly, dexamethasone (4 h before) partially inhibited PAF-induced leakage in the trachea and main bronchi. In summary, in rat airways, both low and high doses of dexamethasone markedly inhibit mediator-induced plasma exudation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In Group 3 animals with no lung injury, the 99mTc-DTPA clearance rate, expressed as k, the percent decrease in thoracic radioactivity, was similar to that previously reported for healthy rabbits (k = 1.16 +/- 0.57%/min, mean +/- SD). Oleic acid administration to Groups 1 and 2 resulted in significantly faster clearance rates, with identical biphasic curves in all animals, irrespective of fibrinogen status. There were no significant differences between either the initial fast phase (k, Group 1 = 5.26 +/- 1.83%/min, Group 2 = 5.70 +/- 1.77%/min) or the subsequent slow phase (k, Group 1 = 1.67 +/- 0.63%/min, Group 2 = 1.57 +/- 0.55%/min, p greater than 0.05).

Fibrinogen depletion plus oleic acid injury resulted in greater alveolar cellular exudate, edema, and hemorrhage than did either oleic acid or fibrinogen depletion alone. We conclude that fibrinogen is not necessary to produce biphasic 99mTc-DTPA clearance in oleic acid lung injury.\r"

  ".W": "The lung is a complex organ composed of a large number of different cell types of varying size and shape. Quantification of lung structure requires an understanding of how the distribution of specific cells and their characteristics affect the accuracy of measurement made on them and how to optimize experimental design for a morphometric study. We have studied lung structural modifications in a variety of lung injuries over the last decade. Extensive quantitative data from EM morphometric studies of pulmonary tissue have been collected. These data provide a unique opportunity to study the accuracy and efficiency of methods used to quantitate lung structure. We present and discuss novel computation-intensive methods for the estimation of biologic variability, sampling error, and measurement error. A new concept, unnested analysis of variance for stratified sampling and the use of computer-based methods for statistical analysis (the bootstrap method) and optimizing experimental design (nonlinear minimization procedure) are described in this report. Examples of experimental designs with their corresponding levels of accuracy and cost are also provided. The number of samples needed for a given level of precision is affected by the volume density of the structure being measured. The most important determinant for the overall accuracy of a morphometric study is the number of animals studied. Biologic variations between samples within an animal and among animals can vary significantly as a function of the model of injury studied.\r"

  ".U": "91158194\r", 
  ".W": "In acute quadriplegia we have noted that about one in five patients develops unexplained production of markedly excessive and tenacious bronchial mucus. Spontaneous recovery from mucus hypersecretion usually occurs within weeks to months. Mucus samples collected from 12 patients have been found to be abnormal. Macromolecular contents of single aspirates yielded as much as 500 mg. Analytical ultracentrifuge analysis showed the mucus to contain considerable epithelial glycoprotein (GP) of typical buoyant density; its amino acid and carbohydrate compositions were characteristic of the GP from hypersecretory bronchial mucus such as in chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis. In five patients studied after recovery from hypersecretion, there tended to be relatively less GP. The mucus samples contained a high density glycoconjugate (GC): this had sugars of GP but also reacted positively with a monoclonal antibody to keratan sulfate. Its amino acid composition was different from that of GP: threonine was lower and glycine was higher than in GP. In mucus from one patient who died, chondroitin sulfate ABC and hyaluronic acid were identified as well. This suggests proteoglycans are involved in the pathophysiology of mucus hypersecretion. The sudden onset and spontaneous recovery of hypersecretion suggests that it is not due to gland hypertrophy. We speculate that in acute quadriplegia it is due to disturbed neuronal control of bronchial mucus gland secretion, perhaps related to initial disappearance and later reappearance of peripheral sympathetic nervous system tone.\r"

Clinically, they seemed to have severe emphysema, but the pathologic basis of their symptoms had not been investigated previously. Seven patients have died and been autopsied: in four, the lungs were fixed, inflated, dried, and examined in detail radiologically, grossly, microscopically, and by electron probe X-ray microanalysis. All seven patients had severe panlobular (panacinar) emphysema that tended to be more severe in the lower lung zones and that was associated with microscopic talc granulomas. Vascular involvement by talc granulomas was variable, but significant interstitial fibrosis was not present. Five patients were tested for alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency and found to be normal, as were six similar living patients. These findings indicate that some intravenous drug abusers develop emphysema that clinically, radiologically, and pathologically resembles that caused by alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency but which must have a different pathogenesis. Talc from the Ritalin tablets may be important, but the mechanism remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "Preapneic thoracic gas volume (Vtg), arterial saturation (SaO2), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2), have been shown to influence the rate of SaO2 fall (dSaO2/dt) during apnea. We asked the following question: does tissue oxygen consumption (tVO2) affect the dSaO2/dt during apnea? We attempted to answer this question by comparing dSaO2/dt during obstructive apneas (high tVO2) with dSaO2/dt during nonobstructive apneas (low tVO2) in six adult baboons. Fiberoptic central venous and arterial catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SvO2, SaO2, and cardiac output. A sapphire-bearing turbine monitored minute ventilation and airflow cessation. A Respitrace and esophageal pressures were used to assess relative differences in Vtg. Obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60-s) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at end-expiration. Nonobstructive apneas were created by paralyzing the animals with atracurium and interrupting ventilation for periods equivalent to those of the obstructed apneas. The ventilator was adjusted to duplicate the respiratory rate, tidal volume, and relative Vtg of the spontaneously breathing animal. Mean tVO2 during spontaneous breathing was 110 ml/min (Fick method) and decreased to 90 ml/min during paralysis (p less than 0.05). The dSaO2/dt for the three apnea durations (mean, all animals), obstructive versus nonobstructed were: 0.85 and 0.74%/s (n = 6), 0.87 and 0.75%/s (n = 6), and 0.60 and 0.48%/s (n = 4), respectively. The dSaO2/dt was significantly lower during the nonobstructive apneas. We conclude that differences in VO2 during apnea may affect the dSaO2/dt and that for the same duration apnea, central apneas may show less desaturation than obstructive apneas where vigorous muscular efforts at overcoming obstruction are common.\r"

Both required prolonged assisted ventilation because of severe shunt physiology. Open lung biopsies on admission revealed a small vessel vasculitis as the sole morphologic abnormality in both patients. Both responded to high dose corticosteroids. Neither patient exhibited evidence of systemic vasculitis, and neither had serologic evidence of an immune disorder. Common to both patients was ingestion of L-tryptophan. One patient exhibited several features of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The other patient did not appear to have the syndrome, but the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and initiation of L-tryptophan treatment was striking. The presentation of these patients alters our notions concerning the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by this agent, and the response to methylprednisolone supports its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder.\r"

Avoidance of CPR when death is anticipated, or when the patient does not wish resuscitation, requires the writing of a do-not-resuscitate order. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation has the risks of trauma, residual impairment if incompletely successful, and prolongation of dying. Like any other medical treatment, CPR should only be administered if it is expected to confer lasting benefit to the patient. If CPR does not offer even a modicum of lasting benefit, it is not medically appropriate to administer the treatment, and the physician may write a do-not-resuscitate order. The rationale for writing the order should be documented, and the patient and family should be informed of the treatment decision. Hospital regulations regarding the writing of DNR orders should reflect this approach. Experience to date indicates that there is minimal risk of malpractice or criminal action in relation to writing do-not-resuscitate orders.\r"

Many of these patients have been shown to have a linear relationship between these two variables over a wide range of TO2, which has been considered as evidence of pathologic supply dependency. This supply dependency contrasts with animal studies that have clearly demonstrated a biphasic relationship between TO2 and VO2. This review of the available data concerning the relationship between oxygen transport and supply under conditions of increased oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen transport suggests the possibility that the observed interaction in patients may, in many cases, represent the normal physiologic behavior of the system rather than an abnormal manifestation of impaired oxygen extraction.\r"

DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in candidates for renal transplantation. The cytomegalovirus serologic status of both recipients and donors were determined, and the recipients were followed for periods of 6 months to 7 years after transplant. SETTING: A university transplant center. PATIENTS: The analyses were made on 237 patients who were given either vaccine or placebo, received renal transplants, and were followed for at least 6 months. INTERVENTION: Subcutaneous inoculation with Towne live attenuated virus or with placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of cytomegalovirus infection was defined by virus isolation and antibody tests. If infection occurred, a prearranged scoring system for cytomegalovirus disease was used to objectify disease severity. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated, and there were no discernible long-term adverse effects. Recipients who were originally seropositive did not clearly benefit from vaccination. Protective efficacy was analyzed in the group at highest risk for cytomegalovirus disease; recipients who were seronegative at the time of vaccination and who received a kidney from a seropositive donor. Compared with placebo recipients, vaccinated patients in this group had significantly less severe cytomegalovirus disease, with a significant reduction in disease scores (P = 0.03) and 85% decrease in the most severe disease (95% CI, 35% to 96%), although infection rates were similar. Graft survival at 36 months was improved in vaccinated recipients of cadaver kidneys (8 of 16) compared with unvaccinated recipients (4 of 16) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Previous vaccination of seronegative renal transplant recipients with live cytomegalovirus results in reduction of disease severity mimicking the action of naturally derived immunity.\r"

INTERVENTION: Patients received partially pure IFN-alpha intramuscularly, from 3 to 9 million U/d (51 patients) or recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (Roferon, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey), 5 million U/m2 body surface area daily (45 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Hematologic and cytogenetic tests were administered. MAIN RESULTS: Seventy of the patients (73%) achieved hematologic remission (95% CI, 63% to 81%), and 18 (19%) had complete suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome on at least one cytogenetic test. A complete cytogenetic response was induced in 7 of 51 or 14% (CI, 6% to 26%) of the patients treated with the partially pure IFN-alpha and in 11 of 45 or 24% (CI, 13% to 40%) of the patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a. The difference in complete cytogenetic response between the two groups was 10.7% (CI, - 5% to 26%; P greater than 0.2). Eleven patients had durable, ongoing, complete cytogenetic responses from 6 to more than 45 months (median, more than 30 months). CONCLUSION: This study was the first to show sustained, complete cytogenetic responses in a subset of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with single-agent therapy. The nature of this remission, that is, whether it depends on continuous therapy, requires further study.\r"

MEASUREMENTS: Stroke or death within 2 years. MAIN RESULTS: Three factors were associated with stroke or death: age of more than 65 years, diabetes, and hypertension. Based on regression coefficients, age of more than 65 years was assigned 3 points; diabetes, 3 points; and hypertension, 2 points. An initial prognostic system comprised risk groups 1 (0 points), 2 (1 to 5 points), and 3 (6 to 8 points). Outcome rates in the three groups were 2%, 31%, and 54% (P less than 0.0001), respectively. In an independent test sample, the corresponding outcome rates for the initial system were 12%, 21%, and 31% (P = 0.04). A final prognostic system, including two additional predictors (coronary heart disease [1 point] and the distinction between stroke and transient ischemic attack for the baseline event [2 points]), comprised risk groups 1 (0 to 2 points), 2 (3 to 6 points), and 3 (7 to 11 points). Corresponding outcome rates were 3%, 27%, and 48% (P less than 0.001) in the original cohort and 10%, 21%, and 59% (P less than 0.001) in the test cohort.

The variables included rates of mortality, hospitalizations, operations, physician visits, and endoscopies, and the amount of disability-related loss of work and early retirement in six countries (Belgium, England and Wales, the Federal Republic of Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States). MEASUREMENTS: Nonparametric epidemiologic time-trend analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The historic, slow, declining trend in mortality and hospitalization rates continued. The rate of operations for peptic ulcer disease exhibited a large, one-time reduction, then returned to a parallel declining trend, but at a lower level. The rate of physician visits declined by 50%. The greatest changes were found in the rate of endoscopy use and in disability-related loss of work and early retirement, where increasing trends were quickly followed by decreasing trends. The elderly, especially women, generally did not share many of these benefits. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of new interventions can be understood more fully by examining several variables in many countries over a long time. Contrary to expectations, the effects of the widespread use of histamine H2 antagonists have been more indirect (affecting work loss and disability retirement more) than direct (affecting high-cost medical service use and mortality less).\r"

  ".W": "For over 200 years digitalis compounds have been used to treat atrial fibrillation. The rapid ventricular response to atrial fibrillation is frequently treated with digoxin to produce a controlled heart rate. Digoxin has also been proposed as a treatment for terminating recent-onset atrial fibrillation, for maintaining sinus rhythm after an episode of atrial fibrillation, and as prophylactic therapy in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to prevent excessive tachycardia during a paroxysm. Perhaps because it has been used for so long, few of these indications have been studied scientifically until recently. Studies now suggest that in patients with atrial fibrillation, digoxin is a poor drug for controlling heart rate during exertion, has little or no effect in terminating the arrhythmia, and may occasionally aggravate paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Despite adequate digitalization, the heart rate at the onset of a paroxysm of fibrillation in patients receiving the drug does not differ from the heart rate in patients not receiving it. This article discusses the current role of digoxin in the management of patients with chronic, recent-onset, or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To describe information requests expressed during clinical teaching. SETTING: Residents' work rounds, attending rounds, morning report, and interns' clinic in a university-based general medicine service. SUBJECTS: Attending physicians, medical house staff, and medical students in a general medicine training program. METHODS: An anthropologist observed communication among study subjects and recorded in field notes expressions of a need for information. We developed a coding scheme for describing information requests and applied the coding scheme to the data recorded. Based on assigned codes, we created a subset of strictly clinical requests. MEASUREMENTS: Five hundred nineteen information requests recorded during 17 hours of observed clinical activity were selected for detailed analysis. These requests related to the care of approximately 90 patients by 24 physicians and medical students. Sixty-five requests were excluded because they were not strictly clinical, leaving a subset of 454 clinical questions for analysis. MAIN RESULTS: On average, five clinical questions were raised for each patient discussed. Three hundred thirty-seven requests (74%) concerned patient care. Of these 337 questions, 175 (52%) requested a fact that could have been found in a medical record. Seventy-seven (23%) of these questions, motivated by the needs of patient care, were potentially answerable by a library, a textbook, a journal, or MEDLINE. Eighty-eight (26%) of the questions asked for patient care required synthesis of patient information and medical knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians in the study settings requested information frequently. Many of these information needs required the synthesis of patient information and medical knowledge and thus were potentially difficult to satisfy. A typology is proposed that characterizes information needs as consciously recognized, unrecognized, and currently satisfied.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To review risks for infection and to outline strategies to protect the health of travelers infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). DATA SOURCES: Original reports and summaries of the geographic distribution and frequency of infections as well as of special risks these infections impose on HIV-infected persons. The recommendations incorporate guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the World Health Organization. STUDY SELECTION: Sources containing the most recent, pertinent information. DATA SYNTHESIS: Infections of the gastrointestinal tract are common in all travelers to developing countries and are likely to be more frequent, severe, and difficult to treat in HIV-infected persons. Prominent among the respiratory tract infections that pose special risks to HIV-infected travelers are influenza, measles, and fungal infections with geographically focal distributions. The most common vector-borne infection, malaria, appears to present relatively little, if any, incremental risk to the HIV-infected traveler. Persons with HIV infection respond less vigorously to vaccines and have a higher frequency of adverse reactions to antimicrobial agents. Nevertheless, immunizations and chemoprophylaxis can reduce the risk for many travel-related infections. Additionally, there are protective measures that travelers can take to minimize exposure to pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: By understanding the risks for disease in different destinations, assessing patients' HIV status, counseling patients about travel plans and personal protective measures, appropriately using vaccines and chemoprophylaxis, as well as instituting early treatment of infection, physicians can help HIV-infected patients to preserve their health during travel.\r"

In the present study, 100 isolates of E. coli resistant to multiple antibiotics, including trimethoprim (100%), sulfisoxazole (100%), streptomycin (94%), and ampicillin (87%), were obtained over a 5-month period from stool samples of diapered children attending four day-care centers and tested for their susceptibilities to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, cephalexin, and cephalothin. The MICs for 50 and 90% of strains tested were 16 and 32 micrograms/ml, respectively, for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 4 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively, for cefuroxime, 4 and 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, for cephalexin, and 32 and greater than 64 micrograms/ml, respectively, for cephalothin. Although all three oral beta-lactams tested were generally active at concentrations likely to be achieved in urine, cefuroxime and cephalexin were more potent and are thus more likely to be inhibitory at the concentrations needed for systemic infections.\r"

This phenomenon has also been noticed in our hospital. To confirm our observation, methicillin and ciprofloxacin susceptibilities were tested by disk diffusion and broth microdilution techniques. We studied 83 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates obtained from various sources over a 4-month period. Ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, greater than 2 micrograms/ml) was detected in 69 isolates (83%). Prior use of ciprofloxacin was reported for 24 of 69 patients with ciprofloxacin-resistant strains and 0 of 14 patients with ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains. The day of detection during the hospital stay and the location of the source patient were not significantly different between resistant and susceptible strains. Bacteriophage typing showed a higher occurrence of nontypeable strains among ciprofloxacin-resistant strains (54%). Review of our microbiology register showed a progressive increase in the rate of resistance to ciprofloxacin during the first year of use, with initial rates being about 10% and recent rates being higher than 80%. On the other hand, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus remained uniformly susceptible to ciprofloxacin (98.4%). We conclude that prior use of ciprofloxacin is an important factor for the selection of ciprofloxacin-resistant strains and that ciprofloxacin has limited usefulness against methicillin-resistant S. aureus.\r"

  ".U": "91158274\r", 
  ".W": "Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection that is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The high toxicity of the antifungal agent that is mainly used against cryptococcosis, amphotericin B (AMB), accounts for the need for new treatments, especially in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome because of the high relapse rate of cryptococcosis. Drug targeting may be one of these alternate treatments. Since we have demonstrated that an immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-Cryptococcus neoformans serotype A monoclonal antibody (E1) was protective during experimental cryptococcosis in mice, we investigated whether specific targeting of AMB with liposomes that bear E1 would improve the therapeutic index of the drug. For that purpose, in vitro and in vivo experiments were designed to compare the specificities and activities of these liposomes with those of control immunoliposomes bearing a nonrelated IgG1 monoclonal antibody (CY34). The immunoliposomes were prepared by covalently linking E1 or CY34 and small unilamellar vesicles. When immunoliposomes were incubated with yeast cells, only E1-bearing liposomes recognized C. neoformans. In vivo, mice that were treated 24 h after infection with one injection of AMB (0.12 mg/kg of body weight) intercalated into E1-bearing liposomes survived significantly longer than did those given the same dose of AMB alone or AMB intercalated into nontargeted liposomes or control immunoliposomes. None of the mice that were given control treatments did statistically better than those that were given AMB. Keeping in mind that this kind of therapy requires knowledge of the antigenic type of the infecting organism, the results suggest that specific targeting of small doses of AMB improve the efficacy of AMB and might be an alternative to the use of larger doses of AMB.\r"

We observed that this exclusion barrier was most efficient in excluding the hydrophilic drug INH, as this drug could not penetrate a wall matrix formed of various polymethylated lipidic or amphipathic substances. Two main strategies were proposed for circumventing this drug resistance: (i) synthesis of amphipathic derivatives of otherwise highly hydrophilic drugs and (ii) inhibition of synthesis of the bacterial outer layer. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate that attaching a palmitic acid side chain to INH rendered it growth inhibitory against M. avium complex bacteria and that the concomitant use of this amphipathic INH derivative with m-fluorophenylalanine (an inhibitor of mycoside C biosynthesis which causes the disruption of the bacterial outer layer) resulted in further enhancement of its activity, leading to a bactericidal effect.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the activity of the combination of sulbactam and ceftriaxone against a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain producing TEM-3, a new extended-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase, in an endocarditis model. In vitro, ceftriaxone was strongly inactivated in the presence of TEM-3 (MBC, 128 micrograms/ml with an inoculum of 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml). A marked inoculum effect was demonstrated with sulbactam: effective concentrations of inhibitor needed to reduce the MIC and MBC of ceftriaxone to similar levels increased from 1 microgram/ml in the presence of an inoculum of 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml to 20 micrograms/ml in the presence of an inoculum of 1 x 10(7) CFU/ml. In vivo, sulbactam given at 200 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h, a dosage higher than that previously reported to be effective against rabbit endocarditis caused by other microorganisms, was not sufficient to restore the complete activity of ceftriaxone given at 30 mg/kg once daily for 4 days. This insufficient activity may be correlated with the presence of a high level of beta-lactamase inside the vegetations, as indicated by a quantitative in vitro assay of beta-lactamase activity in the cardiac vegetation, suggesting an insufficient inactivation of the extended-broad-spectrum beta-lactamase in vivo.\r"

Rabbits infected with either of two methicillin-susceptible strains (SA-12871 or its moderately teicoplanin-resistant derivative SA-12873) or a methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain (MRSA-494) were treated with daptomycin, 8 mg/kg of body weight, every 8 h; teicoplanin, 12.5 mg/kg (low-dose teicoplanin [teicoplanin-LD], excluding MRSA-494) or 40 mg/kg (high-dose teicoplanin [teicoplanin-HD]) every 12 h; or vancomycin, 17.5 mg/kg every 6 h, for 4 days. Compared with no treatment daptomycin, teicoplamin-HD, and vancomycin significantly reduced bacterial counts of all test strains in vegetations and renal and splenic tissues (P less than 0.001). Teicoplanin-LD was equally effective against SA-12871 but failed against SA-12873, with three of six animals still being bacteremic at the end of therapy. For SA-12871, daptomycin was as effective as teicoplanin-HD and was superior to teicoplanin-LD and vancomycin (P = 0.02) in lowering vegetation bacterial counts. There were no differences between daptomycin, teicoplanin-HD, or vancomycin in the reduction of bacterial counts in tissues for any of the test strains. In rabbits infected with SA-12871, vegetations from 33% of teicoplanin-LD-treated, 6% of teicoplanin-HD-treated, and 13% of daptomycin-treated animals yielded organisms for which there were up to eightfold increases in the MICs. Resistance may have contributed to early death in one daptomycin-treated animal. No increases in the MICs for the test strain were detected in animals infected with SA-12873 or MRSA-494.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Trospectomycin sulfate, a chemically synthesized analog of spectinomycin, exhibits a broad range of activity against both aerobes and anaerobes, including the etiological agents of sexually transmitted diseases. Its activity in vitro against Escherichia coli is considered only moderate. At subinhibitory levels, however, trospectomycin induced changes in a pathogenic strain of E. coli, UC 9451, which significantly increased its sensitivity to serum lysis. This strain of E. coli shows high-level resistance to serum in vitro, typically growing twofold within a 45-min incubation period. Following exposure to one-fifth the MIC of trospectomycin, greater than 99% of the bacteria were killed in 25% serum within 15 min. Surviving bacteria were static in this level of serum for over 3 h. Killing was due to lysis mediated by both the classical and alternative complement pathways. The bacteria exposed to trospectomycin were enlarged in both diameter and length, but they still grew at rates comparable to those of untreated bacteria. No other visible morphological changes could be directly related to the increase in serum sensitivity. The profile of outer membrane proteins obtained by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was identical for trospectomycin-treated or untreated bacteria. However, the relative proportion of four major outer membrane proteins varied considerably.\r"

  ".W": "We report the ultrastructural alterations induced during the proliferative stages of Trypanosoma (Schizotrypanum) cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, by two ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors, ketoconazole and terbinafine, which had previously been shown to be potent growth inhibitors whose effects are potentiated when used in combination (J. A. Urbina, K. Lazardi, T. Aguirre, M. M. Piras, and R. Piras, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 32:1237-1242, 1988). Epimastigotes treated with a low concentration of ketoconazole (1 microM), which blocks ergosterol biosynthesis at the level of C-14 demethylation of lanosterol and induces cell lysis coincident with total ergosterol depletion, showed gross alterations of the kinetoplast-mitochondrion complex, which swelled and lost the organization of its inner membrane and the electron-dense bodies of its matrix. Thus, coincident with the beginning of cell lysis, the kinetoplast-mitochondrion complex occupied greater than 80% of the cell volume, while other subcellular structures such as the nucleus and subpellicular microtubules were not affected. Terbinafine, which blocks ergosterol synthesis in these cells at the level of squalene synthetase and thus leads to almost immediate arrest of growth at concentrations greater than 1 microM, produced proliferation of glycosomelike bodies, binucleated cells (arrest at cytokinesis), and eventually massive vacuolization. When the drugs were combined, the predominant effect was mitochondrial swelling, which was more drastic and took place earlier than that observed in cells treated with ketoconazole alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Plasmid-encoded resistance to the aminoglycosides gentamicin (Gm), tobramycin (Tm), and kanamycin (Km) (GmTmKmr) in strains of Staphylococcus aureus isolated in Australia and North America appears to be mediated by one resistance determinant. In Australian isolates, this determinant is flanked by inverted copies of a 1.3-kb insertion sequence, IS256, thereby forming a composite transposon, Tn4001. Analysis of two conjugative plasmids and a related nonconjugative plasmid from strains of S. aureus isolated in North America showed that the GmTmKmr determinant on these plasmids is also flanked by inverted repeats. In the nonconjugative plasmid, these repeats include only 425 bp of IS256 immediately adjacent to the GmTmKmr region and identical to that on Tn4001. This truncated Tn4001 element is flanked by copies of the insertion element IS257, and together these elements form a truncated Tn4001-IS257 hybrid transposonlike structure. A third copy of IS257 was located 418 bp from the hybrid structure. The truncated Tn4001 and three repeats of IS257 were present at a conserved site on the plasmids studied. Four additional copies of IS257 were identified on the two conjugative plasmids. These elements flank determinants for resistance to the aminoglycosides neomycin and paromomycin and to ethidium bromide and quaternary ammonium compounds, as well as the region involved in conjugative plasmid transfer.\r"

  ".W": "Teicoplanin is an investigational glycopeptide antibiotic that is structurally and microbiologically similar to vancomycin. Since teicoplanin possesses a very long elimination half-life, the manufacturer suggests that the drug be administered every 12 h for the first day of therapy and once daily thereafter. We studied the multiple-dose (6 mg/kg per dose) pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in volunteers following intravenous administration every 12 h for 5 days and then every 24 h for 9 days in an attempt to identify the optimal duration of the every-12-h loading-dose regimen. Multiple serum samples were obtained throughout the study, including intensive sampling after the first and last doses; urine was collected during the entire study. A three-exponential equation was fitted to the serum concentration data. The mean terminal-phase half-life was 157 +/- 93 h. Concentrations of teicoplanin in serum similar to those observed after the administration of the last dose (day 14) were observed following the fourth or fifth dose given every 12 h. Therefore, it is suggested that for clinical dosing regimens for teicoplanin, dosing every 12 h for approximately 48 h should be used, followed by once-daily dosing thereafter.\r"

  ".W": "The activities of sparfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and erythromycin for 21 clinical Legionella isolates were determined by agar and broth dilution susceptibility testing and by growth inhibition assays in guinea pig alveolar macrophages (sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin). All three antimicrobial agents had roughly equivalent activities when buffered charcoal yeast extract agar medium supplemented with 0.1% alpha-ketoglutarate was used as the test medium; the MICs for 90% of strains were 1.0 micrograms/ml for erythromycin and sparfloxacin and 0.5 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin. Buffered charcoal yeast extract medium supplemented with 0.1% alpha-ketoglutarate inhibited the activities of all the antimicrobial agents tested, as judged by the susceptibility of a control Staphylococcus aureus strain. Broth macrodilution MICs for two L. pneumophila strains in buffered yeast extract supplemented with 0.1% alpha-ketoglutarate were less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml for sparfloxacin, 0.06 microgram/ml for ciprofloxacin, and 0.25 microgram/ml for erythromycin; only erythromycin was inhibited by this medium. Ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin (both 0.25 microgram/ml) reduced bacterial counts of two L. pneumophila strains grown in guinea pig alveolar macrophages by 2 log10 CFU/ml, but regrowth occurred over a 3-day period. Sparfloxacin, but not ciprofloxacin (both 1 microgram/ml), caused a 3- to 4-day postantibiotic effect. Pharmacokinetic and therapy studies of sparfloxacin were performed in guinea pigs with L. pneumophila pneumonia. For the pharmacokinetic study, sparfloxacin was given (10 mg/kg of body weight) to infected guinea pigs by the intraperitoneal route; peak levels in serum and lung were 2.6 micrograms/ml and 1.6 micrograms/g, respectively, at 1 h, with a terminal-phase half-life of elimination from serum of 5 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MICs determined by the disk elution method demonstrated a reproducibility rate of 97% as well as 97% agreement with the reference method to within +/- 1 dilution; MBCs showed 93% agreement.

  ".W": "The in vitro and in vivo susceptibilities of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi to cefuroxime were compared with those of several other antibiotics commonly used to treat this disease. Cefuroxime demonstrated a higher MBC in vitro (1.0 microgram/ml) than ceftriaxone (0.08 microgram/ml) or erythromycin (0.32 microgram/ml), but the MBC was similar to that of amoxicillin (0.8 microgram/ml) and doxycycline (1.6 micrograms/ml). B. burgdorferi was considerably less susceptible to tetracycline (3.2 micrograms/ml) and penicillin G (6.4 micrograms/ml). Of the three other Borrelia species tested, two (Borrelia turicatae and Borrelia anserina) also demonstrated susceptibility to cefuroxime, while the third (Borrelia hermsii) was less susceptible. Results obtained with four antimicrobial agents in the in vivo hamster model parallel the antibiotic susceptibilities in the in vitro study. The three antibiotics with similar MBCs in vitro, i.e., cefuroxime, doxycycline, and amoxicillin, demonstrated comparable activities in preventing borreliosis in B. burgdorferi-challenged hamsters (50% curative doses = 28.6, 36.5 and 45.0 mg/kg, respectively). Penicillin G, which demonstrated the highest MBC in vitro, had very weak protective activity in the hamster model system. These results indicate that the in vitro and in vivo activities of cefuroxime against B. burgdorferi are comparable to those of several oral antibiotics currently being used in the treatment of early Lyme disease and suggest that the oral form of this cephalosporin may be an effective alternative therapy for this disease.\r"

It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.\r"

The animals received oral antipyrine (20 mg/kg of body weight) with and without ciprofloxacin pretreatment (40 mg/kg orally once a day for 8 days). The total plasma clearance of antipyrine was decreased from 0.130 +/- 0.007 to 0.090 +/- 0.005 liter/h (mean +/- standard error of the mean) (P less than 0.01) by ciprofloxacin, while the half-life at beta (elimination) phase and the area under the concentration-time curve for antipyrine were increased from 1.90 +/- 0.22 to 2.83 +/- 0.29 h (P less than 0.05) and from 43.25 +/- 3.35 to 52.41 +/- 2.31 mg.h/liter (P less than 0.05), respectively. The urinary excretions of norantipyrine, 4-hydroxyantipyrine, and 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine decreased by 73, 43, and 54%, respectively (P less than 0.001), in the 96 h after ciprofloxacin treatment. In addition, the rate constants for formation of each of these metabolites were significantly decreased, by an average of approximately 75%. These results suggest that ciprofloxacin is capable of inhibiting oxidative metabolism. This finding could be of clinical significance for drugs that are highly dependent of metabolic pathways, such as those inhibited in this study.\r"

However, at a concentration of 0.31 microgram/ml, LY217896 inhibited the replication of dividing MDCK cells. LY217896 (9 mg/m2 of body surface area per day) administered in the diet, in the drinking water, by oral gavage, by intraperitoneal injection, or by aerosolization was well tolerated and protected CD-1 mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A or B virus. Effective administration of the compound could be delayed for up to 96 h postinfection. Virus titer was reduced by 1 to 2 log10 units in lungs of mice given LY217896 in the drinking water. Mice treated initially with protective levels of LY217896 were resistant to a subsequent challenge of influenza virus in the absence of the compound, indicating that the animals were able to develop immunity to the initial infection. Administration of LY217896 to uninfected mice did not induce interferon-like activity or interfere with natural killer cell function. In the ferret, LY217896 was effective in preventing fever induced by influenza virus.\r"

The agreements (in percent) of the hybridization results with the deduced enzyme contents for Staphylococcus and Enterococcus species were, respectively, 80 and 87.6 for ANT(6) (aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase), 99.8 and 100 for both APH(3') (aminoglycoside phosphotransferase) and APH(2\")-AAC(6') (aminoglycoside acetyltransferase), and 100 and 100 for ANT(4'). The weak correlation obtained with the probe for ANT(6) was due to the fact that gram-positive cocci can also be streptomycin resistant by synthesis of APH(3\") or ANT(3\")(9) and by ribosomal mutation. The remaining probes appeared to be specific: they hybridized with all the resistant clinical isolates but not with the susceptible strains. These results indicate that, except for streptomycin, nucleic acid hybridization is a valid approach for the detection and characterization of aminoglycoside resistance in gram-positive cocci.\r"

MICs of most beta-lactams except cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, and meropenem were relatively high or very high. All enzymes hydrolyzed cephaloridine (Vmax, 100%; Km, 12 to 70 microM), cephalothin (Vmax, 25 to 826%; Km, 8 to 143 microM), cefamandole (Vmax, 13 to 158%; Km, 17 to 170 microM), and cefuroxime (hydrolysis rate, 19 to 98%), and 11 of 12 hydrolyzed cefotaxime (Vmax, 26 to 145%; Km, 13 to 127 microM); no hydrolysis of cefoxitin or moxalactam was observed. Penicillins were hydrolyzed at lower rates, with Vmax values less than or equal to 20% of that obtained with cephaloridine. Addition of clavulanate, sulbactam, or tazobactam led to a 4- to 2,048-fold lowering of MICs of penicillins as well as cephalosporins. All enzymes were inhibited by clavulanate (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], 0.01 to 1.8 microM), sulbactam (IC50, 0.02 to 1.9 microM), tazobactam (IC50, 0.001 to 0.9 microM), cefoxitin (IC50, 0.002 to 0.35 microM), and moxalactam (IC50, 0.03 to 6.6 microM). No enzymes were inhibited by 100 microM EDTA or p-chloromercuribenzoic acid; an enzyme of one strain of B. loescheii was inhibited by 100 microM cloxacillin (IC50, 2.35 microM). Ten enzymes had optimal activity at pH 5.0 to 6.0, and two had optimal activity at pH 8.0. Isoelectric focusing revealed pIs between 4.2 and 5.6. These enzymes seem to belong to a previously unclassified group of beta-lactamases, related (but not identical) to beta-lactamases of the B. fragilis group.\r"

We applied phenylboronic acid-agarose chromatography to the purification of Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase. Two factors interfered with the success of the previously described single-step chromatographic protocol. First, staphylococcal beta-lactamase exhibited non-active-site-mediated adsorption to the agarose used as a support for the meta-aminophenylborate ligand, preventing the recovery of beta-lactamase from the column. Second, the staphylococcal beta-lactamases exhibited low affinity for meta-aminophenylborate with inhibition constants (Kis) ranging from 8.0 x 10(-3) to 20.0 x 10(-3) M. These problems were resolved by modifying the buffers utilized during chromatography and increasing the dimensions of the affinity column, and a two-stage procedure consisting of cation-exchange chromatography followed by affinity chromatography was used to purify each of the four variants of staphylococcal beta-lactamase. The mean specific activities of the purified type A, B, C, and D beta-lactamases were 44.6, 12.2, 10.6, and 30.8 mumol of nitrocefin hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein, respectively. Dimer formation, presumably from intramolecular cysteine-cysteine cross-linking, was observed with the type D beta-lactamase but not with the type A, B, or C enzyme.\r"

  ".U": "91158298\r", 
  ".W": "During a 4-month period in late 1988, we isolated ceftazidime-resistant strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and other members of the family Enterobacteriaceae from 29 patients at a chronic-care facility in Massachusetts. Ceftazidime resistance resulted from two distinct extended-spectrum beta-lactamases of the TEM type which efficiently hydrolyzed the cephalosporin: YOU-1 with a pI of 5.57 and YOU-2 with a pI of 5.2. Genes encoding these enzymes were present on different but closely related high-molecular-weight, multiple antibiotic resistance plasmids of the H12 incompatibility group and were transferable by conjugation in vitro. Agarose gel electrophoresis of extracts from clinical isolates indicated that this outbreak arose from plasmid transmission among different strains of the family Enterobacteriaceae rather than from dissemination of a single resistant isolate. Isolation rates of ceftazidime-resistant organisms transiently decreased after use of this drug was restricted, but resistant isolates continued to be recovered 7 months after empiric use of ceftazidime ceased.\r"

  ".U": "91158299\r", 
  ".W": "Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from 11 patients at the Miriam Hospital were identified as resistant to cefoxitin and ceftibuten as well as to aztreonam, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. Resistance could be transferred by conjugation or transformation with plasmid DNA into Escherichia coli and was due to the production of a beta-lactamase with an isoelectric point of 8.4 named MIR-1. In E. coli, MIR-1 conferred resistance to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftibuten, ceftriaxone, and such alpha-methoxy beta-lactams as cefmetazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, and moxalactam. In vitro, MIR-1 hydrolyzed cephalothin and cephaloridine much more rapidly than it did penicillin G, ampicillin, or carbenicillin. Cefotaxime was hydrolyzed at 10% the rate of cephaloridine. Cefoxitin inactivation could only be detected by a microbiological test. The inhibition profile of MIR-1 was similar to that of chromosomally mediated class I beta-lactamases. Potassium clavulanate had little effect on cefoxitin or cefibuten resistance and was a poor inhibitor of MIR-1 activity. Cefoxitin or imipenem did not induce MIR-1. The gene determining MIR-1 was cloned on a 1.4-kb AccI-PstI fragment. Under stringent conditions, probes for TEM-1 and SHV-1 genes and the E. coli ampC gene failed to hybridize with the MIR-1 gene. However, a provisional sequence of 150 bp of the MIR-1 gene proved to be 90% identical to the sequence of ampC from Enterobacter cloacae but only 71% identical to that of E. coli, thus explaining the lack of hybridization to the E. coli ampC probe. Plasmid profiles of the 11 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were not identical, but each contained a plasmid from 40 to 60 kb that hybridized with the cloned MIR-1 gene. Both transfer-proficient and transfer-deficient MIR-1 plasmids belonged to the N incompatibility group. Thus, the resistance of these K. pneumoniae strains was the result of plasmid acquisition of a class I beta-lactamase, a new resistance determinant that expands the kinds of beta-lactam resistance capable of spread by plasmid dissemination among clinical isolates.\r"

Determination of the hybridization profiles by colony hybridization with this selection of probes, termed \"oligotyping,\" allowed characterization of the TEM variants present in 265 clinical isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae that exhibit synergism between a penicillinase inhibitor and broad-spectrum cephaslosporins. Among the 222 strains harboring TEM enzymes, Klebsiella pneumoniae (48%) and Escherichia coli (21%) were predominant, and TEM-3 was the most common enzyme (60%). Penicillinases TEM-1 and TEM-2 were detected alone (15 and 1%, respectively), combined (1%), or associated with another TEM beta-lactamase (17 and 6%, respectively). Fourteen variants, including seven new enzymes, were detected. One, TEM-13, was a new penicillinase with the same isoelectric point and substrate range as TEM-2 but differed by a single amino acid substitution, whereas the others, TEM-14 to TEM-19, were extended-spectrum beta-lactamases that consisted of novel combinations of known amino acid substitutions. Different TEM variants were found to coexist within the same cells. A patient could harbor two or three different strains that encoded the same enzyme or two indistinguishable isolates that produced distinct TEM beta-lactamases.\r"

  ".W": "By using broth microdilution methods, the in vitro activity of tosufloxacin (A-64730), a new quinolone, was compared with those of other agents, including five quinolones, against geographically diverse cystic fibrosis sputum isolates obtained from 26 cystic fibrosis centers in the United States. These included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, conventional as well as especially resistant (ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin, and/or tobramycin) isolates: Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas cepacia; Staphylococcus aureus; and Haemophilus influenzae. Tosufloxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of standard P. aeruginosa were 0.5 and 2.0 mg/liter, for resistant P. aeruginosa they were 4.0 and greater than 16.0 mg/liter, for E. coli they were less than or equal to 0.016 mg/liter, for P. cepacia they were 4.0 and 8.0 mg/liter, for S. aureus they were 0.063 and 0.063 mg/liter, and for H. influenzae they were less than or equal to 0.016 and 0.032 mg/liter, respectively. Tosufloxacin activities against standard and resistant strains of P. aeruginosa were similar to those of comparative quinolones. Against E. coli, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. Against S. aureus, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin, but tosufloxacin was more active than other agents. Against H. influenzae, tosufloxacin activity was similar to those of other quinolones. There was minor diminution of activity at pH 8.2 but major diminution of activity at pH 5.2 and at inoculum sizes of greater than or equal to 10(7) CFU/ml. Activity was unaffected by sputum but was enhanced by serum and by the omission of cation supplementation. Tosufloxacin has consistent activity against common cystic fibrosis pathogens. Its high degree of activity against S. aureus with activity maintained against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacteria of interest suggests that further in vitro studies and assessment of activity in in vivo models of cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections are warranted.\r"

Aerosolized rimantadine delivered at a concentration of 40 micrograms/liter of air was associated with nasal burning and irritation in normal volunteers. A concentration of 20 micrograms/liter of air was well tolerated for up to 12 h by normal volunteers and was not associated with any changes in pulmonary function, as measured by routine spirometry, plethysmography, or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide. Mean peak levels of drug in serum were approximately 10-fold lower after 12 h of aerosol administration than they were after oral administration of 200 mg (29.7 versus 255 ng/ml, respectively), while mean nasal wash levels were approximately 100-fold higher (6,650 versus 66.6 ng/ml, respectively). Elimination half-lives were similar after both aerosol and oral administration (24.1 and 25.2 h, respectively), and rimantadine urinary excretion was less than 1% per 24 h in both groups. Twenty micrograms of aerosolized rimantadine per liter of air given 12 h daily for 3 days to nine adults with acute influenza virus infection was well tolerated. Levels in plasma after 12 h of aerosol inhalation were similar to those in normal volunteers, but were higher at the end of the third treatment than they were at the end of the first treatment (88.3 versus 47.9 ng/ml, respectively). Thus, rimantadine delivered via small-particle aerosol at a dose of 20 micrograms/liter of air was well tolerated in normal volunteers and in those with acute influenza and was associated with high local concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue penetration of cilofungin (LY121019), a new echinocandin antifungal compound, by intermittent and continuous infusion in rabbits. Following a single intravenous dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum concentration in plasma was 297 +/- 39 micrograms/ml, the area under the curve was 30.1 +/- 6.7 micrograms.h/ml, clearance was 30 +/- 10 ml/min/kg, volume of distribution was 0.85 +/- 0.23 liters/kg, half-life in distribution phase was 3.7 +/- 0.2 min (first 12 min postdose), and half-life in elimination phase was 12.9 +/- 0.7 min. When rabbits received cilofungin by continuous infusion (CI) at 10 mg/kg/h over 6 days, sustained concentrations in plasma of 290 +/- 56 micrograms/ml were seen, more than 50-fold higher than predicted if kinetics were linear. Similarly, at 5 mg/kg/h, high levels were also obtained. Such elevated levels in plasma would not have been predicted from the pharmacokinetic characteristics of cilofungin given as a single intravenous dose. Further pharmacokinetic study at several rates of CI suggested that cilofungin elimination follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Simultaneous cilofungin levels in plasma and tissue were then determined for rabbits receiving six intravenous, intermittent doses (ID) of cilofungin at 15 mg/kg every 4 min and for rabbits receiving CI as described above. After ID, the mean of the ratios of cilofungin levels in tissue to those in plasma were highest for liver and bile but very low for cerebrum and cerebellum. After CI, ratios were as much as 89 times higher than for ID and significantly greater in the brain, choroid, kidney, and bile (P less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty different organisms were tested, and replicate, trial, and reader variabilities were examined. When the total-variance component was used, if the true MIC was 16 micrograms/ml, then the chance that the observed MIC was between 8 and 32 micrograms/ml, inclusive, was 95%. For all analyses, the isolate (P = 0.0001) and reader (P less than 0.03) effects were significant. The probability of specific MIC observations for various true MICs (over the range of 16 to 32 micrograms/ml at 4-micrograms/ml increments) was calculated. For true MICs of 20, 24, and 28 micrograms/ml, the probabilities of observing an MIC of 16 or 32 micrograms/ml (inclusive) were 86, 75, and 62%, respectively. An upward bias was shown to exist in addition to sources of sizeable variation. The recommendation stemming from recognition of this inherent variability is that ranges of percent susceptibility at various concentrations be included in reports of in vitro susceptibility studies.\r"

This developed rapidly (within two hours) and was characterised by swelling of the tectorial membrane and damage to both inner and outer hair cells, with parallel functional damage demonstrable electrophysiologically. All these changes could be attenuated by pretreatment with dexamethasone. Such endotoxin mediated lesions may be the mechanism by which hearing loss occurs in bacterial meningitis.\r"

Their hypocalcaemia was associated with hyperphosphataemia and very low concentrations of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone. None of the babies suffered from congenital cardiac disease. Cell mediated immunity, measured in five patients, was normal. There were no chromosomal abnormalities but all patients shared several dysmorphic features including deep set eyes, microcephaly, thin lips, beaked nose tip, external ear anomalies, micrognathia, and depressed nasal bridge. Mental retardation of varying degree was found in all patients. All had severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. Four patients have died. The remaining eight patients are on treatments with vitamin D and calcium supplements with no change in their growth pattern. We believe that this association of congenital hypoparathyroidism with severe growth failure and dysmorphism represents a new syndrome.\r"

In the anorchic boys average adult height was 177.1 cm, compared with a mean mid-parental height of 174.4 cm, and mean predicted adult heights of 177.0 cm (Tanner-Whitehouse method) and 178.0 cm (Bayley-Pinneau method). In the patients with gonadotrophin deficiency, mean adult height was 176.9 cm, compared with a mean mid-parental height of 176.1 cm, and mean predicted adults heights of 174.0 cm (Tanner-Whitehouse method) and 177.3 cm (Bayley-Pinneau method). We conclude that this testosterone regimen allows achievement of full growth potential in such patients.\r"

A total of 111 outcome studies were found that reported morbidity data in cohorts of VLBW infants born since 1960. The methods used and results obtained in these studies were systematically assessed. No agreement exists about the definition of study populations, descriptive statistics, or measurement of outcome. Follow up ranged from six months to 14 years. In 85 cohorts the incidence of cerebral palsy was recorded, and in 106 that of disability. Studies that followed up infants for longer time periods reported higher incidences of disability. Studies from the United States reported higher incidences of disability than those from other countries. The median incidence of cerebral palsy among all the cohorts studied was 7.7%, and the median incidence of disability was 25.0%. Despite substantial improvements in the mortality of VLBW infants, poor outcomes among survivors are common.\r"

Changes in eczema were correlated with changes in asthma in 231 holidays taken by children with both conditions, but improvement was not significantly associated with pet ownership.

Mean body weight on admission was 97.8% of their reference stable weight seven to 10 days after the attack and in only three children was it less than 95% of the stable weight. Bedside assessment of dehydration was unreliable. The mean packed cell volume was significantly higher on admission than 7-10 days later (0.44 compared with 0.42, difference 0.02 SE 0.01). Serum sodium and potassium concentrations and osmolality on admission were within normal ranges. The degree of dehydration correlated best with a fall in blood pH. There was no association between the degree of dehydration and the recovery of the peak expiratory flow rate during the first 24 hours or thereafter. We conclude that mild dehydration is common in severe acute childhood asthma. Fluid given at a rate of 50 ml/kg/24 hours was safe and appropriate for these children.\r"

This was undertaken to compare the precision and accuracy of the results with those derived from skinfold thickness against measurement of stable isotopically labelled water (H2(18)O) dilution as a standard. The comparisons were carried out to see to what extent the impedance method could be applied with confidence to assessment of children with growth disorders. Total body water was derived from impedance (I) using an association with height (Ht2/I). Impedance and skinfold thickness estimates of total body water were equally precise when compared with values obtained from H2(18)O dilution (limits of agreement -1.9 to +1.3 and -1.7 to +2.0 kg respectively). The mean intraobserver coefficient of variation for repeat measurements of impedance was 0.9% compared with 4.6% for skinfold thickness with an interobserver coefficient of variation for impedance of 2.8%. Bioelectrical impedance estimation of body composition is likely to be of value in the growth clinic when expertise in measurement of skinfold thickness is limited or repeated measurements are to be undertaken by different observers.\r"

Village children of poor nutritional state (less than or equal to 74% weight for age compared with the National Center for Health Statistics reference curve) had secretory IgA outputs that were only one third of those of better nourished individuals. In contrast, the patients with chronic diarrhoea had secretory IgA outputs that were significantly raised compared with village children, regardless of nutritional state. These results demonstrate that secretory IgA production in the urinary tract can be stimulated by intestinal disease, suggesting that malnourished children are able to mount a response to mucosal infection and supporting the hypothesis of a common secretory immune system.\r"

The virus is spread predominantly by infected nasal secretions and we investigated whether we could reduce its incidence by cohorting babies on each ward into designated areas and encouraging staff and parents to wash their hands. We examined the incidence of hospital acquired infection due to respiratory syncytial virus in all children less than 2 years old and in those with congenital heart disease. In 1986-7, before any intervention, 18 (4.2%) of 425 hospitalised children less than 2 years old developed hospital acquired infection due to respiratory syncytial virus. In 1987-8, after intervention, five (0.6%) of 840 children developed hospital acquired infection but there were fewer ward admissions with community acquired infections due to the virus. In 1988-9, when there were more community acquired infections than 1986-7, six (1.1%) of 552 children developed hospital acquired infection. In 1986-7, eight (34.8%) of 23 children less than 2 years old with congenital heart disease developed hospital acquired infection due to respiratory syncytial virus; all eight were among 11 children with congenital heart disease hospitalised for more than 14 days. In 1987-8, one (3.3%) of 30 children with congenital heart disease developed hospital acquired infection due to respiratory syncytial virus and in 1988-9 there was one (2.1%) case out of 47 children with congenital heart disease. Handwashing and cohorting significantly reduce the incidence of nosocomial respiratory syncytial virus infection.\r"

Height was negatively associated with social class but the association was not significant after allowing for biological variables. A negative gradient of height with size of sibship was evident in white children but was less so in Afro-Caribbean and Asian children. The individual associations of 11 different environmental characteristics were examined after allowing for biological factors and size of sibship. Consistent associations with height included a negative gradient of height with increasing latitude and an association of taller stature with increasing maternal age. A social class gradient in height is accounted for by associations with biological factors, particularly the parental heights; environmental attributes are weakly associated with height after allowing for biological factors.\r"

In addition 39 children had their heart rates monitored during a 12 hour period on a Saturday. Few children experienced the volume (frequency, intensity, and duration) of physical activity associated with an improvement in cardiopulmonary fitness. Shorter (five minute) periods of the required intensity were, however, quite common. No difference between moderate amounts of activity was detected between boys and girls, but the boys had more five minute sessions of intense activity than the girls. These findings suggest that more research into the effects of short periods of intense physical activity on the cardiopulmonary systems of young children is required and that the determinants of habitual physical activity require further investigation especially in the context of sex differences at such an early age.\r"

  ".U": "91158337\r", 
  ".W": "Alport's syndrome is characterised by morphological and structural changes of the renal basement membranes. As the hydroxyproline content of isolated glomerular basement membranes is reduced in patients with Alport's syndrome, it is possible that the renal excretion of 3-hydroxproline (3-OHP), a key substrate of basement membrane collagen, may be altered in such patients. The urinary excretion of 3-OHP was determined by thin layer chromatography in 20 patients with Alport's syndrome, in healthy control subjects, and in patients with other renal diseases. These included patients with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, lower urinary tract infection, severe reflux nephropathy, lithium induced nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, familiar benign haematuria, and renal graft rejection. Urinary excretion of 3-OHP was significantly higher in patients with Alport's syndrome compared with the patients with other renal diseases and the healthy control subjects. All other renal diseases investigated had 3-OHP values within the normal range. Urinary 3-OHP determination detected patients with Alport's syndrome with a high sensitivity (95.2%) and specificity (97.2%). We therefore suggest using urinary 3-OHP determinations as a simple non-invasive screening test for Alport's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Although traditional obligations of fidelity require physicians to deliver quality care to their patients, including to utilize costly technologies, physicians are steadily losing their accustomed control over the necessary resources. The \"economic agents\" who own the medical and monetary resources of care now impose a wide array of rules and restrictions in order to contain their costs of operation. However, physicians can still control resources indirectly through \"gaming the system,\" employing tactics such as \"fudging\" that exploit resource rules' ambiguity and flexibility to bypass the rules while ostensibly honoring them. Physicians may be especially inclined to game the system where resource rules seriously underserve patients' needs, where economic agents seem to be \"gaming the patient,\" with needless obstacles to care, or where others, such as hospitals or even physicians themselves, may be denied needed reimbursements. Though tempting, gaming is morally and medically hazardous. It can harm patients and society, offend honesty, and violate basic principles of contractual and distributive justice. It is also, in fact, usually unnecessary in securing needed resources for patients. More fundamentally, we must reconsider what physicians owe their patients. They owe what is theirs to give: their competence, care and loyalty. In light of medicine's changing economics, two new duties emerge: economic advising, whereby physicians explicitly discuss the economic as well as medical aspects of each treatment option; and economic advocacy, whereby physicians intercede actively on their patients' behalf with the economic agents who control the resources.\r"

  ".W": "Major recent advances in the diagnosis and understanding of gastroesophageal reflux disease have afforded the practicing clinician a number of therapeutic options to treat the increasingly recognized affected patient population. With highly effective acid-suppressive therapies available, simple life-style modifications, such as selective food and medicine avoidance, weight loss, smoking cessation, elevation of the head of the bed, and the judicious use of antacids and alginate, have been relegated to a minor, if any, role in the management of these patients. The validity of these recommendations, however, remains consistent with our current understanding of the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Although few well-designed placebo-controlled trials have been conducted, a review of the medical literature indicates an appreciable efficacy of these interventions, which are founded on well-studied physiologic determinants of gastroesophageal reflux. Most patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease can be managed by reassurance and simple life-style adjustments alone. The therapy for those with chronic or relapsing disease should always include the adjunctive reinforcement of these simple, efficacious, and cost-effective measures.\r"

  ".U": "91158357\r", 
  ".W": "The obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome has been considered to be a cause of both transient blood pressure elevations during sleep and sustained hypertension during the awake state. The purpose of this review was to examine critically the existing literature regarding (1) the blood pressure alterations associated with OSA, (2) causal mechanisms relating specific blood pressure alterations to OSA, and (3) potential consequences of the systemic circulatory abnormalities associated with OSA. Particular attention was directed at studies that assessed the prevalence of OSA in patients with hypertension and that examined the effects on blood pressure of treatment of OSA. We conclude that patients with OSA have abnormal sleep blood pressure patterns, manifested most frequently by apnea-associated blood pressure elevations. Confounding factors such as obesity and antihypertensive drug therapy, and conflicting evidence regarding changes in daytime blood pressure after therapy for OSA, make it premature to conclude that OSA and daytime hypertension are directly associated. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the blood pressure alterations that occur during sleep could contribute to the high cardiovascular morbidity in patients with OSA. Further research into the relationship between OSA and hypertension should improve the future care of patients with these conditions and enhance our understanding of cardiopulmonary pathophysiology.\r"

The meaning of bad news to the patient may be quite different than the medical or the personal meaning to the physician. Differences in perception must be explored and understood before the common ground necessary for joint decision making is established. Initial patient responses can be divided into three categories: (1) basic psychophysiologic (fight-flight or conservation-withdrawal), (2) cognitive, and (3) affective. Responses vary considerably depending on the meaning of the diagnosis to the patient, the degree of immediate threat, and the patient's previous experience with illness. Desired outcomes of the initial meeting include (1) minimizing aloneness and isolation for both patient and physician; (2) achieving a common perception of the problem; (3) giving information tailored to the immediate needs of the patient; (4) addressing immediate medical needs, including the risk of suicide; (5) responding to immediate discomforts; and (6) ensuring a basic plan for follow-up. Though all clinicians deliver bad news, few have had formal training or open exploration of the profound potential impact of the experience.\r"

The reported mean cutoff levels for labeling a total serum cholesterol level as abnormal dropped from 5.84 to 5.43 mmol/L (226 to 210 mg/dL) and for initiating medication, from 7.34 to 6.54 mmol/L (284 to 253 mg/dL). The proportion of physicians using diuretics as preferred step 1 antihypertensive agents dropped from 60% to 32%. Preferences became evenly divided among diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Advice about physical exercise changed little, but consensus among practicing physicians was high. Substantial improvements were found in smoking cessation activities. Practicing physicians are proving to be responsive to new scientific evidence and education in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\r"

Prick-puncture testing using eight unstandardized allergens was performed. Allergen skin test reactivity was classified by means of the mean diameter of the erythema reaction at the 20-minute reading. Nonreactors were the comparison group. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased as allergen skin test reactivity increased, with the odds ratio exceeding 8 for the group with two or more positive test results. The prevalence of asthma increased with increasing allergen skin test reactivity only in nonsmokers. The odds ratio for allergic rhinitis with allergen skin test reactivity was higher with outdoor than indoor allergens. The association of allergic rhinitis with allergen skin test reactivity was higher when a physician had previously diagnosed allergic rhinitis. Chronic rhinitis was not associated with allergen skin test reactivity.\r"

Participants included chronically ill, elderly outpatients (N = 258) and their primary physicians (N = 105). Patients and physicians were independently administered a questionnaire regarding patient quality of life and preferences for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation for the patient. Physicians rated patients' global quality of life, physical comfort, mobility, depression, anxiety, and family relationships significantly worse than did patients. Nearly all perceptions of patients' quality of life were significantly associated with physicians' perceptions, but not patients' treatment preferences. Patient-physician agreement on patient global quality of life was not significantly associated with agreement regarding treatment preferences. We conclude that primary physicians generally consider their older outpatients' quality of life to be worse than do the patients. Furthermore, physicians' estimations of patient quality of life are significantly associated with physicians' attitudes toward life-sustaining treatment for the patients. For the patients, however, perceived quality of life does not appear to be associated with their preferences for life-sustaining treatment.\r"

When compared with the entire clinic population, patients with syphilis tended to be older and were more likely to acknowledge intravenous drug use, more often had a history of syphilis, and, among men, were more often homosexually active. Half of the men with syphilis and one third of the women fell into one or more of these high-risk subgroups. Patients with syphilis were also more likely to test positive for HIV infection than other patients attending the clinic. Patients admitting to intravenous drug use, prior syphilis, or being homosexually active were significantly more likely to be HIV seropositive than patients without these characteristics, even though patients with these characteristics were significantly more likely to refuse HIV serologic testing. Although clinical stage of syphilis at presentation did not differ when patients with and without concurrent HIV infection were compared, geometric mean rapid plasma reagin titers were significantly higher in HIV-infected patients with secondary syphilis.\r"

To improve counseling messages for these individuals, we evaluated data collected from a well-characterized cohort of 387 blood donors who had been monitored for up to 2 years. We sought to determine if persons with indeterminate Western blot patterns were infected with HIV, and whether information derived from follow-up monitoring would assist in the development of counseling messages for persons on whom no follow-up information was available. Donors were studied by laboratory assays, clinical evaluation, and assessment of risk for HIV. The absence of HIV infection in 97 of 98 donors with indeterminate Western blot patterns was confirmed by clinical follow-up, Western blot assays of sequential samples, and negative gene amplification results. We propose supplemental guidelines to be used as an adjunct to existing interpretive criteria for counseling individuals when they first present with an indeterminate Western blot finding.\r"
