  ".W": "Androgens stimulate hair growth in some areas, e.g., beard, but may cause regression and baldness on the scalp. The mesenchyme-derived dermal papilla is believed to regulate many aspects of hair growth. It is probable that androgens exert their effect on hair growth via the dermal papilla. In this study the effect of androgens on the growth of cultured dermal papilla cells from beard and non-balding scalp was assessed. Dermal papilla cells from beard hair follicles and non-balding scalp were cultured in vitro in the presence and absence of different concentrations of testosterone or the synthetic, non-metabolizable androgen, mibolerone. Cell growth was reflected by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine. The presence of either androgen did not significantly alter DNA synthesis at any of the concentrations examined in either type of cell line. These results do not mean that dermal papilla cells do not respond to androgens in vitro, but that the measurement of cell growth is an inappropriate method of assessment. Androgens may well stimulate the synthesis of specific proteins that could influence the hair follicle.\r"

  ".U": "91302895\r", 
  ".W": "Although it has been shown previously that an acidic (type I) \"soft\" keratin can interact with many basic (type II) \"soft\" keratins to form 10-nm intermediate filaments, it has been unclear whether \"soft\" keratins are compatible with the \"hard\" keratins typically found in hair and nail. To address this issue and to generate more structural information about hard keratins, we have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone that encodes a mouse hair basic keratin (b4). Our sequence data revealed new information regarding the structural conservation of hard keratins as a group, being significantly different from soft keratins. Using expression vectors containing appropriate cDNA inserts, we studied the expression of this basic (b4) as well as an acidic (a1) mouse hair keratin in HeLa cells. The expression of these alien hair keratins in the transfected cells was surveyed using a panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Our results indicated that the basic and acidic hair keratin readily incorporated into the existing endogenous soft keratin network of HeLa cells. Overproduction of hair keratin, however, occasionally led to the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates containing both hard and soft keratins. These data suggest that although small amounts of newly synthesized hair keratins can incorporate into the \"scaffolding\" of the preformed soft keratin filament network, possibly through dynamic subunit exchange, overproduction of hard keratins can lead to the partial collapse of the soft keratin network. These observations, along with the deduced amino acid sequence data, support and extend the concept that hard and soft keratins, although closely related, are divergent enough to justify their being divided into two separate subgroups.\r"

  ".U": "91302897\r", 
  ".W": "The diffuse dermal immunofluorescence (DDIF) observed in human skin biopsies that is produced by fluorochrome-conjugated antisera reactive with human immunoglobulin G (IgG) has commonly been viewed in the past as an artifact of direct immunofluorescence microscopy. However, it has been our belief that DDIF, which has been observed in 14% of the biopsies processed in our laboratory, might represent an in vivo phenomenon of excess unbound dermal interstitial immunoglobulin G reflective of elevated serum IgG levels. To examine this hypothesis, we carried out a blinded prospective study of the frequency of DDIF in two groups of age- and sex-matched patients that differed with respect to the presence or absence of serum hypergammaglobulinemia (gamma globulin greater than 2.5 mg/100 ml). The subjective intensity of DDIF and the fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-human IgG antibody titer at which point DDIF disappeared were both compared with serum gamma globulin levels. Also, the amount of IgG that could be extracted from biopsy specimens by an overnight phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) elution procedure was quantified by solid-phase immunoassay. We noted a trend of increased DDIF intensity with increasing serum gamma globulin levels. In addition, there was a relatively weak but significant positive correlation between DDIF endpoint titers and serum gamma globulin levels (p = 0.05, r = 0.429). The strongest positive statistical correlation observed in the study was between the quantities of IgG that could be eluted from skin biopsies and serum gamma globulin levels (p = 0.01, r = 0.599). These findings suggest that DDIF is a true biologic phenomenon reflective of elevated serum gamma globulin levels and demonstrate that simple overnight elution of unbound dermal IgG can unmask the presence of disease-related, specifically-bound IgG.\r"

All of the 40 anticentromere antibody (ACA)-positive sera immunoprecipitated CENP-B-alphoid DNA fragment complex, whereas 10 healthy control sera and 10 other autoantibody positive sera did not. Five of the ACA-positive sera, which did not show reactivity of CENP-B in immunoblotting analysis, immunoprecipitated CENP-B-DNA complex. In some sera antigenicity to CENP-B may be weakened by denaturation.\r"

Attempts have been made in the laboratory to show that when this is done scores on various audiometric tasks will improve. Whether such laboratory benefit will be preferred by patients in their daily life is another matter. Despite a lack of knowledge on this subject, modifications are frequently made to a hearing aid system in the expectation that this will improve auditory performance and hence be preferred by the patient. The most common modifications made to an ear level aid in the British National Health Service are adjusting the tone control and venting the ear mould with the aim of emphasizing the higher frequencies. A randomized crossover study was carried out in 83 first time hearing aid users with a mild to moderate hearing impairment to assess whether a hearing aid at the 'H' tone setting and with a 2 mm vented mould would be preferred by those with a more marked high frequency impairment. BE series aids were used so that any findings could be directly translated to NHS practice. No consistent preference for the modified system was identified when patients were subgrouped according to the overall slope (0.5 to 4 kHz) of their audiogram. However, when the slope between 0.25 and 1 kHz, which corresponds to the real ear effect of these modifications, was analyzed patients with a slope at these frequencies preferred the high-tone emphasis system (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The children with cholesteatoma were between 3-12 years and 76 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Eight of them only presented after the onset of acute mastoiditis. One child had a definite congenital cholesteatoma. Only one had a pars flaccida origin of the cholesteatoma sac and only eight an origin from the postero-superior pars tensa. All had open cavity surgery. When the cavity was lined by temporalis fascia, healing was improved markedly.\r"

The isolation rate of H. influenzae was much lower among sleep apnoea controls (2.7 per cent) than among either the patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis (20.3 per cent) or those with tonsillar hypertrophy (36.7 per cent) (p less than 0.05), as was that of group A streptococci, 5.4 per cent versus 16.9 and 20 per cent, respectively (though the latter differences were not statistically significant). The isolation frequencies of B. catarrhalis, pneumococci, group C and G streptococci did not differ between the three groups. The high tonsillar core recovery rates of H. influenzae and group A streptococci both in patients with recurrent acute tonsillitis and in those with tonsillar hypertrophy, as compared with normal controls, suggests the possible involvement of these bacteria in both conditions.\r"

Functional improvement i.e. reduction of lagophthalamos and restoration of the blink reflex was good in our opinion and that of the patients in all cases. Dissatisfaction with the cosmetic result was expressed by two patients due to the prominence of the weight under the thin eyelid skin. Three patients had to have the weight replaced because it was too light. Two patients had their weights removed because of recurrent eyelid infections. In two patients the weights were removed as they had migrated over the tarsal rim. In one of these patients the weight was replaced immediately in the appropriate position, in the other it was not replaced as dissatisfaction had been expressed due to the bulky appearance of the weight under the eyelid skin.\r"

  ".W": "With the advent of automated anesthesia record keeping devices, concern has arisen that \"abnormal\" values will appear in the record and possibly lead to medicolegal compromise. A retrospective review of automated records from a series of anesthesia cases was undertaken to determine if abnormal values do occur, how frequent they are, and whether they cause problems. A total of 14,826 (4,942 each) noninvasive heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure readings from 118 case printouts generated by a Diatek Arkive Patient Information Management System (63 cases) or a Datascope Datatrac record keeper (55 cases) were recorded. The study sample covered a broad range of surgical operations, anesthetic procedures, and patient ages and medical histories. During these 118 anesthetics, the majority of readings of all three variables fell within normal ranges (defined for this study as 80 to 180 and 50 to 110 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic blood pressures, respectively, and 60 to 140 beats/min for heart rate). During the anesthetics, 3.6% of the systolic pressure readings, 13.25% of the diastolic readings, and 4.25% of the heart rate readings were recorded outside these ranges. No serious intraoperative or postoperative anesthesia complications were associated with these out-of-range readings, nor would they be expected in a sample of this size, since serious anesthetic complications are rare. This preliminary observation of one person's experience may help address the concern associated with allowing high and low blood pressure and heart rate readings to be automatically recorded \"unsmoothed.\" In medicolegal situations, it should also begin to demonstrate that such fluctuations are neither uncommon nor abnormal, and that a true record of these readings should be neither a cause for concern nor an opportunity for medicolegal exploitation.\r"

In nontransfused neonates, the correlation between measured concentrations of fetal hemoglobin and post-natal age was r = 0.53 with a 17.2 standard error of prediction. In these same neonates, the correlation between measured fetal hemoglobin divided by birth weight and gestational age was r = 0.70, with a 9.6 standard error of prediction. A three-variable regression equation (the latter two variables plus calculated fetal hemoglobin) was found to have a high correlation with data for measured fetal hemoglobin (r = 0.97) and a relatively low 8.4 standard error of prediction. In transfused neonates, however, measured hemoglobin concentrations divided by birth weight correlated poorly with gestational age (r = 0.30 and a 12.4 standard error of prediction). In addition, the transfused neonates had low correlations when fetal hemoglobin concentrations alone were compared with the total volume of red blood cell transfusions (r = 0.35) and with postnatal age (r = 0.18) and the standard errors of prediction were all approximately 17. The correlations found between concentrations of fetal hemoglobin and age in transfused neonates were poorer than those reported in earlier nontransfused infant studies. Previous studies have also shown that neonatal blood containing fetal hemoglobin interferes with the spectrophotometric measurements of carboxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin. Because of the imprecision in the predictions of fetal hemoglobin using age, weight, or the volume of transfusion, we conclude that fetal hemoglobin should be measured if accurate spectrophotometric determinations of carboxyhemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin are desired.\r"

The Finapres monitor overestimated systolic pressure by 5.8 +/- 11.9 mm Hg, while the Dinamap monitor underestimated systolic pressure by -6.9 +/- 9.2 mm Hg (P = 0.003). Dinamap mean and diastolic pressure biases were less than 2 mm Hg, while the Finapres biases for these variables were significantly greater (7.7 +/- 10.0 and 8.2 +/- 9.8 mm Hg, respectively). There was no difference in systolic or mean pressure precision between the two devices (approximately 10 mm Hg), but the diastolic precision of the Dinamap unit was superior to that of the Finapres. While in most patients the Finapres monitor provided continuous blood pressure data equivalent to the data from the radial artery, marked bias (greater than 15 mm Hg) was exhibited in 2 patients for all three pressure variables. Despite this bias, blood pressure changes were tracked closely in these 2 patients. We conclude that, in its current form, the Finapres monitor cannot be relied upon independently to accurately measure blood pressure in patients undergoing general anesthesia. Since the Dinamap monitor measures mean pressure reliably and accurately, we suggest that mean blood pressure values between the Finapres and Dinamap monitors be compared to guide one in interpreting Finapres data.\r"

We compared the records from 1987 with 1,716 anesthetic records from 1989, when automated blood pressure monitors were used universally. The incidences of hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy were determined during the two periods and compared using Student's two-tailed t test. The data revealed that the incidence of detected hypotension increased from 2.4 to 5.2% with the use of automated blood pressure monitors (P less than 0.00002). We conclude that at our hospital the use of automated noninvasive blood pressure monitors increases the incidence of detection of intraoperative hypotension as compared with the use of manual blood pressure measurement.\r"

We measured substance P-like immunoreactivity in the plasma, saliva, and pericardial fluid of subjects with and without pain (chronic and acute) to determine if substance P levels are altered. Some recent studies have suggested that substance P in various body fluids may be a correlate of chronic pain. To test this correlation it is important to ensure that the assay is measuring what it was designed to measure. Therefore, the influence of three tachykinins on the analysis of substance P concentrations was assessed with a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit. A small (approximately 2 to 6%), apparently nonspecific elevation in measured substance P was found when alpha-neurokinin, beta-neurokinin, or eledoisin was incubated with substance P and its antibody. Our results also indicate an apparent specific affinity of the substance P antibody for alpha-neurokinin (above 1,000 pg/ml) and beta-neurokinin (above 5,000 pg/ml). Substance P levels in the body fluids we tested ranged from 0.47 to 62.88 pg/mg protein (47.4 to 230.8 pg/ml). Levels of the tested tachykinins have not been determined in body fluids. If alpha-neurokinin or beta-neurokinin is found to be present in high concentrations in these fluids, this commercially available substance P kit may overestimate substance P levels. The concentrations of tachykinins necessary to interfere specifically with the assay are 10- to 100-fold higher than substance P in body fluids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to identify a biologic basis for the aggressive clinical behavior of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphomas (HAL), dual-parameter flow-cytometric analysis was performed on 22 paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. Cases were analyzed for DNA ploidy, the percentage of cells in S-phase (proliferative activity), and content of a recently identified proliferation-associated nuclear antigen, p105. The DNA-content analysis of 22 HALs was compared with that of 109 cases of intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) unrelated to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) studied previously in our laboratory and 125 cases of high-grade NHL reported in the literature. The proliferative activity was higher in intermediate-grade HAL relative to non-AIDS NHL (24.0% v 10.4%; P = .03), and in high-grade HAL in comparison with NHLs of similar histology unassociated with HIV infection (24.8% v 19%), although the latter did not reach statistical significance. The number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields was found to correlate with the percentage of cells in S-phase (r = .68; P = .0004). Although p105 content tended to be higher in HAL than in an AIDS-related complex (ARC)-associated hyperplastic lymph node control, no statistically significant associations were found between p105 content and proliferative activity or the number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields. When compared with non-AIDS NHLs of comparable grade, there was a trend toward a lower incidence of DNA aneuploidy in both intermediate- (25% v 56%) and high-grade (38.5% v 60%) HALs. The higher proliferative activity and lower incidence of DNA aneuploidy found in HAL relative to non-AIDS NHL of comparable histologic grade may represent differences in pathogenesis and may underlie the poor prognosis of HIV-associated NHL.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the frequency, causes, and predictors of adverse events in 624 patients who had completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in three consecutive total therapy studies (VII, IX, and X, 1972 to 1983). Event-free survival in study X was significantly better overall than that in studies VIII and IX (P less than .0001 by the log-rank test). In study X, 75% of the patients were electively taken off therapy, compared with 54% in studies VIII and IX. However, the risks of having an adverse event during the first 5 years after completion of therapy were remarkably similar: 22% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 29%) in study X versus 24% (20% to 29%) in studies VIII and IX. Bone marrow, testicular, and CNS relapses accounted for the majority of failures in both groups (85% in study X and 92% in studies VIII and IX). Late adverse events consisted largely of hematologic relapses and the development of solid tumors. Black race (P = .001) and leukemia without an anterior mediastinal mass (P = .05) were associated with an increased risk of failure after completion of treatment in the two earlier clinical trials, whereas a lower leukemic cell DNA content (DNA index less than 1.16) was the only predictor of late treatment failure in the more recent trial (P = .019). None of the other presenting features that were examined (eg, age, leukocyte count, and sex) had value as predictors of late failure. Thus, improved treatment altered the impact of specific prognostic factors and the distribution of sites of relapse, but it did not significantly affect the risk of delayed failure.\r"

  ".U": "91303184\r", 
  ".W": "To compare the late neuropsychologic toxicities of CNS prophylaxis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), longitudinal assessments were performed on three groups of patients: those who received repeated courses of moderate-dose (1 g/m2) intravenous (IV) and intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) without cranial irradiation (MTX group, n = 26), those who received IT MTX and 18 Gy cranial irradiation (18-Gy group, n = 23), and those who received IT MTX and 24 Gy cranial irradiation (24-Gy group, n = 28). All patients were free of CNS leukemia at diagnosis and had remained in continuous, complete remission 5 to 11 years (median, 7.4 years) following CNS prophylaxis. An analysis of serial intelligence quotient (IQ), achievement, and neuropsychologic studies revealed no significant influence of either age at CNS prophylaxis or CNS prophylaxis group on any neuropsychologic outcome measure. After adjusting for changes in IQ test versions that were necessitated by advancing patient age, no statistically significant declines in Verbal, Performance, or Full Scale IQs were noted for the three CNS treatment groups. However, comparisons of group means masked declines in individual children; 22% to 30% of children exhibited a clinically significant deterioration (greater than or equal to 15 points) in uncorrected IQ values over the study period. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of deterioration in Verbal IQ, but we were unable to identify risk factors associated with other declines in intellect and achievement. The inability to reliably predict individual patients at risk for clinically significant neuropsychologic toxicities on the basis of age at diagnosis or specific method of CNS prophylaxis suggests that other etiologic factors must be explored as the basis for these changes, such as ecologic factors and chemotherapy during the continuation phase of treatment.\r"

  ".U": "91303185\r", 
  ".W": "Between January 1970 and December 1988, 174 consecutive patients under the age of 20 years with curatively resected primary osteosarcoma were treated at our institute; 72 in the years of 1970 to 1981 and 102 in the years 1982 to 1988. In the latter period, adjuvant chemotherapy was replaced by neoadjuvant programs, and new criteria were adopted for the management of lung metastases, consisting in early bilateral surgical staging and lung resection through median sternotomy for all patients with purely intrathoracic relapse. Follow-up was updated in December 1989. During the last period, the overall 5-year survival improved significantly from 35% to 58% (P less than .001). The disease-free survival rose from 38% to 45% at 5 years, with median values of 15 months versus 33 months, while the frequency of isolated lung metastases dropped from 58% to the actuarial 48%. The proportion of patients who underwent complete resections of their pulmonary metastases rose from 17% (seven of 42) to 55% (27 of 49), without operative mortality. Due to such a high proportion of patients eligible for salvage surgery, the overall survival from detection of lung metastases improved from 0% to 28% at 5 years (P less than .001). Contralateral occult metastases were resected in three of 15 subjects with monolateral clinical lesions, and five patients underwent subsequent lung resections. These data indicate that systematic bilateral pulmonary resection plays an important role in improving the final cure rate of childhood osteosarcoma, beyond the benefit resulting from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "A phase II trial using interleukin-2 (IL2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells was carried out in an attempt to treat children with end-stage neuroblastoma. Fifteen patients (median age, 7 years) were enrolled in the study. Twelve were in relapse after massive chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and three had a primary refractory disease after conventional chemotherapy. IL2 was administered as an 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d continuous infusion. One course consisted of a double 5-day treatment period separated by a 6-day break. Cytapheresis to harvest LAK progenitor cells was performed during the rest period. After a 4-day in vitro culture, LAK cells were reinjected during the second cycle of therapy. A phenotypic and functional analysis of immunologic parameters was conducted along with the therapeutic protocol. Toxicity was significant with two toxic deaths (cardiotoxicity and respiratory distress). The reinfusion of large amounts of LAK cells was clearly involved in one case, but this particularly severe toxicity has to be related to the patient's status (ie, heavy pretreatment). No significant clinical response was seen. The immunologic monitoring showed phenotypic and functional modifications in these patients before initiation of treatment and an unexpected absence of evolution of these parameters during IL2 therapy. Although the origin of these immune dysfunctions is not clear, they could be involved in the failure of IL2 therapy. Future studies of IL2 therapy in neuroblastoma should be undertaken earlier in the course of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content were analyzed in a series of stage IVS neuroblastomas by flow cytometry and Southern blot hybridization, respectively. Of the 12 stage IVS neuroblastomas studied, nine were aneuploid (DNA index [DI] greater than 1), two were diploid (DI = 1), and one was not assessable for DNA content due to insufficient tumor material. N-myc gene amplification was present in two of 12 tumors. None of the aneuploid tumors exhibited N-myc amplification. Among the aneuploid neuroblastomas, the DIs were between 1.27 and 1.60, ie, in the near-triploid range. The follow-up from diagnosis ranged from 1 to 41 months (mean, 20 months). The nine neuroblastomas with near-triploid DNA content were free of disease at the end of the follow-up period. In contrast, a rapid and fatal tumor progression was observed for the three neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification and/or diploidy. Although involving only a limited series, these results strongly suggest that the combined analysis of DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content could predict clinical outcome in stage IVS neuroblastoma and should help to identify patients for whom a more aggressive therapy is required.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were treated with three cycles of cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-day continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) at 1,000 mg/m2/d as induction chemotherapy. Subsequent local therapy consisted of surgery for patients with resectable disease and/or radiotherapy. Three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to induction chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients (43%) had a clinical CR that was pathologically confirmed in 12 patients (24%), and 24 patients (47%) had a PR for an overall response rate of 90%. Local therapy included surgery in 24 patients (47%) and radiotherapy alone in 22 patients (43%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 32 patients (63%) frequently at great dose reduction. At a median follow-up of 90 months, the median survival is 22 months (95% confidence interval, 15 to 36 months), and the 5-year survival is 25%, with only five patients known to be alive and disease-free at this time. The median time to progression is 14 months, with 29 patients (57%) having documented progression of their head and neck cancer and eight (16%) having progression of a second neoplasm. Seven patients died of intervening medical events. This high incidence of second malignancies supports the continued investigation of chemoprevention for patients in CR. Despite the known high response rates achieved with cisplatin and 5-FU induction chemotherapy, the overall poor survival data reported here should lead to a thorough reexamination of the frequent administration of this regimen in the community.\r"

  ".W": "Eighty-three patients (median age, 56 years and Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 70) were treated with carboplatin (Carbo) and fluorouracil (5Fu) for stage III and IV head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 5Fu (1 g/m2/d) was administered from day 1 to 4 by continuous infusion. Carbo was given on day 1 and, in order to evaluate its maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), the dose level was progressively increased from 250 mg/m2 to 450 mg/m2. The effectiveness of this association and its potential role in local control were also evaluated. Three patients received Carbo at a dose of 250 mg/m2, 13 received 300 mg/m2, one received 330 mg/m2, 12 received 350 mg/m2, six received 375 mg/m2, 26 received 400 mg/m2, 18 received 420 mg/m2, and four received 450 mg/m2. Two (13 of 83) or three courses (64 of 83), repeated every 4 weeks, were administered. The overall (primary tumor and node) response and complete response (CR) rates were 33% and 14%, respectively. For primary tumor, the response rate (RR) was 57% with 32% CR and 18% pathologic complete response (PCR); the RR was higher for patients with oropharyngeal tumor (76%, P = .037) and for patients treated with Carbo greater than or equal to 350 mg/m2 (65%, P = .02); the tumor size (T1 + T2 v T3 + T4) was a good prognostic factor for RR (90% v 46%, P = .001), CR (65% v 20%, P less than .001), and PCR (45% v 8%, P less than .001). For nodes, the RR was 33% with 11% CR. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were experienced by 17% and 28% of the patients treated with 420 mg/m2 of Carbo and by 50% of the patients treated with 450 mg/m2. The MTD can be fixed at 420 mg/m2 and the proposed dose at 400 mg/m2. Thirty-eight patients were treated with surgery plus radiotherapy, 33 with radiotherapy alone, and seven with surgery alone. The median follow-up is 12 months. The 18-month disease-free survival (DFS) is 78% for overall complete responders and 39% for the others (P = .04). There is no primary tumor recurrence among the 12 patients with a primary tumor PCR treated by radiotherapy alone for tumor control (median follow-up, 17.3 months). The association of Carbo-5Fu is a safe induction chemotherapy regimen for HNSCC. The proposed dose of Carbo for future treatment is 400 mg/m2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

A randomized study reported a 48% relapse rate for patients with positive nodes (stage B1 or stage B2), all of whom were salvaged by full-dose platinum-based chemotherapy. In a series of patients with positive nodes who received two cycles of adjunctive chemotherapy postoperatively, the relapse rate was only 2%. In order to evaluate the effect of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection on relapse rates in patients with stage B1 testicular cancer, a retrospective review of a series of 39 patients was performed. Criteria for inclusion included pathologic stage B1 (less than six positive nodes, located in the primary landing site, with no node greater than 2 cm in diameter and no extracapsular lymph node extension). Patients who fulfilled the criteria along with normalization of tumor markers were followed-up expectantly after retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Thirty-nine patients were followed from 1 to 10 years with the median duration of follow-up of 3.5 years. Ten of the 39 patients had modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissections with preservation of antegrade ejaculation. The other 29 had full retroperitoneal lymph node dissections. Three relapses were seen, one patient with retrocrural and pulmonary metastases and two patients with pulmonary metastases only for a relapse rate of 8% (three of 39). Patients with stage B2 disease received adjunctive chemotherapy with two or three cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. We conclude that retroperitoneal lymph node dissection alone is adequate treatment for the majority of patients with pathologic stage B1 testicular cancer. In that subset of patients, adjunctive chemotherapy should be reserved for relapse.\r"

The median follow-up is 7.7 years. The complete response rate was 60 of 66 MOPP-treated patients (91%) and 54 of 59 MOPP/CABS-treated patients (92%) (difference not significant). The level of the disease-free survival curve at longest follow-up is 65% for MOPP-treated patients and 72% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). The overall survival at 12 years is projected at 68% for MOPP-treated patients and 54% for MOPP/CABS-treated patients (difference not significant). Thus, there were no significant differences in efficacy between MOPP and MOPP/CABS. However, MOPP/CABS was more emetogenic than MOPP, and four MOPP/CABS-treated patients went on to develop secondary acute leukemia. No MOPP-treated patients developed leukemia. High initial erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high platelet counts adversely affected treatment outcome. MOPP-treated patients who received greater than 81% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine over the first three cycles had significantly improved disease-free survival rates over those receiving less than 81%. MOPP/CABS-treated patients who received greater than 82% of the projected dose intensity of vincristine had significantly better overall survival than those who received less than 82%. Disease-free survival on both arms was significantly better in patients who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents. The effect of dose intensity was particularly apparent in patients with poor prognostic factors where those who received greater than 84% of the projected dose intensity of all agents had significantly improved disease-free and overall survival.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with Hodgkin's disease who were previously untreated with chemotherapy received the chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (CHLVPP) regimen plus limited involved-field radiation therapy for treatment of Hodgkin's disease through the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group. One hundred patients, 87 with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease and 13 who relapsed after receiving previous radiation therapy, were treated with this regimen between 1982 and 1989. Complete remissions (CRs) were obtained in 88 of 100 patients (88%), and there have been a total of eight relapses. The overall 3-year failure-free survival was 76%, with good-prognosis patients (ie, Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80) having a 3-year failure-free survival of 87%. Toxicity with this regimen was minimal, with neutropenic fevers reported in 13% of the patient population, moderate alopecia in 5%, and mild to moderate nausea and vomiting in 11% of the patients. As primary induction therapy for Hodgkin's disease, CHLVPP is an effective regimen with a high patient acceptance profile.\r"

  ".W": "Although previous studies have suggested a relatively poor prognosis for some patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, the clinical significance of immunologic phenotype in diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) remains controversial. One hundred one patients with a uniform morphologic diagnosis of DLCL treated at Stanford between 1975 and 1986 with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), methotrexate, bleomycin, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone ([M]BACOD), or methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) chemotherapy were studied with regard to immunologic phenotype. Immunologic analysis, performed on frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue, identified 77 cases of B-cell origin, 21 cases of T-cell origin, and three cases that lacked B-cell or T-cell markers. Analysis of complete remission (CR) rates (84% v 95%), 5-year actuarial freedom from disease progression (38% v 53%), and 5-year actuarial overall survival (52% v 79%) showed no statistically significant differences in prognosis between B- and T-cell patients, respectively. The 5-year actuarial survival of patients with stage IV T-cell DLCL (56%) also did not differ in a statistically significant way from stage IV B-cell patients (36%). We conclude that treatment selection for DLCL should not be based on immunologic phenotype alone.\r"

  ".U": "91303196\r", 
  ".W": "Of 115 adult patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 87 (75.5%) achieved complete remission (CR) after induction treatment with zorubicin and conventional doses of cytarabine (Ara-C). Patients under age 45 years with histocompatibility locus antigen-identical sibling underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The others were treated with two courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy (ICC): course 1 with 4 days of high-dose Ara-C and 3 days of amsacrine (m-AMSA); course 2 with carmustine (BCNU), Ara-C, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide. Forty-two patients received both planned courses, 15 received only the first, and 13 patients could only support conventional maintenance therapy. Four patients died during consolidation. With a median follow-up of 60 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) after ICC at 5 years is 40.3% (+/- 6.5%), with no statistically significant difference between patients receiving one or two courses. The DFS for the 17 transplanted patients is comparable (P = .72) and is lower for the 13 excluded patients (23% +/- 11.5%, P = .046). Age did not influence the probability of remaining in CR. In univariate analysis, three parameters had a negative impact on the 5-year DFS: a high initial WBC count (52% for patients with less than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L v 12% for patients with greater than 30 x 10(9) WBC/L, P = .01), a long delay between induction treatment and course 1 (+/- 60 days; 63% v 29%, P = .01), and a long delay between course 1 and course 2 (+/- 60 days, 61.5% v 28.5%, P = .05). In multivariate analysis (Cox model), only the WBC count remained significant. This study confirms the value of intensive postremission chemotherapy, which can be compared in AML with allogeneic or autologous BMT. It also demonstrates the prognostic value of the initial WBC count. The optimal modalities of ICC remain to be defined by further studies.\r"

A maximum of six cycles were administered at 3 weekly intervals after the cisplatin combination and 4 weekly after the carboplatin combination. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given with the first cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation with the third cycle. The median nadir for neutrophils was 0.47 x 10(9)/L and for platelets, 40 x 10(9)/L. Chemotherapy dosages were not reduced in response to myelosuppression, but treatment was delayed to allow blood count recovery. Sixty-eight percent of patients received all six cycles of chemotherapy, and there were four deaths associated with treatment-related neutropenia. Twenty-eight patients (70%) achieved a complete response (CR) when assessed 1 month after the end of treatment, and a further five patients (12.5%) had a partial response (PR). Median duration of CR was 16 months and of PR, 8 months. Cerebral metastases occurred in 20% of all patients and was the apparent sole site of relapse in 11% of the CR patients.

  ".W": "From April 1985 to September 1988, 128 patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled in a prospective randomized trial evaluating chemotherapy (arm A) versus best supportive care (arm B). Chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1, epirubicin 50 mg/m2 IV day 1, and cisplatin 80 mg/m2 IV day 1 (CE'P regimen) alternating every 4 weeks with methotrexate 30 mg/m2 IV day 1, etoposide 200 mg/m2 IV day 1, and lomustine (CCNU) 70 mg/m2 orally day 1 (MEC' regimen) until progression. Of the 123 patients (62 treated and 61 controls) eligible for survival, 115 were fully evaluable for response (58 treated and 57 controls). Response rates were 21% partial response, 53% stable disease, and 26% progressive disease in arm A, and 47% stable disease and 53% progressive disease in arm B. Median survival was 34.3 weeks (range, 4.3 to 218.6+ weeks) in arm A versus 21.1 weeks (range, 4.3 to 188.6 weeks) in arm B; the difference was not significant at P = .153 (Mantel-Cox). Subgroups of patients retrospectively analyzed by age, performance status, stage M0/M1, and weight loss or not showed no significant difference in survival. Poor-risk patients (at least two of the following: poor performance status, stage M1, weight loss) of arm A survived significantly longer than poor-risk patients of arm B (23.6 weeks v 12.4 weeks, Mantel-Cox P = .008); a significant difference in survival was also observed between nonsquamous cell patients of arm A and those of arm B (median survival, 38.6 weeks v 16.7 weeks; Mantel-Cox P = .041). Toxicity on the chemotherapy arm was hematologic (World Health Organization [WHO] grade greater than 3) in 12% of CE'P and in 13% of MEC' courses and gastroenteric (WHO grade greater than 3) in 24% of CE'P courses and in 8% of MEC' courses. Our alternating treatment was not significantly superior to supportive care. It is likely that certain subgroups of the NSCLC category may have an advantage with chemotherapy.\r"

We prospectively assessed consecutive patients with otherwise operable NSCLC for the incidence and histology of unilateral adrenal masses. Assessment included blood chemistries, lung function tests, bronchoscopy, chest x-ray, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, and upper abdomen. Of 246 patients with otherwise operable NSCLC, 10 (4.1%) had a unilateral adrenal mass. Unilateral adrenal masses were needle-aspirated under CT control. If cytology was nondiagnostic, adrenalectomy was performed. Four (40%) of 10 patients had adrenal metastases proven by needle aspiration. Of the six (60%) patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses, one was demonstrated by needle aspiration. In the other five patients, a nondiagnostic needle aspiration led to adrenalectomy, which yielded two adenomas, two hyperplastic nodules, and one hemorrhagic cyst. There was no significant difference between the patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses with respect to patient age or stage and size of adrenal mass. Patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses underwent curative resection of their NSCLC and had significantly prolonged survival compared with patients with metastatic unilateral adrenal masses treated with chemotherapy (P = .037). Median survival of patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses was greater than 30 months and 9 months, respectively. In conclusion, the presence of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with otherwise operable NSCLC should not preclude thoracotomy without pathologic proof of metastatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Acivicin (AT-125) is a glutamine antagonist with dose-limiting, schedule-dependent CNS toxicity and predictable CSF penetration after intravenous administration. Because of these properties, a trial in CNS malignancies was initiated. Thirty-two patients with recurrent or residual malignant astrocytomas were treated with AT-125. The majority of patients had glioblastoma multiforme (24) and had received prior nitrosoureas (21). The median age was 50 years, and Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) performance status was 2. The major determinant of response was based upon radiologic criteria using computed tomographic (CT) scanning and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The tumor mass was measured in two perpendicular planes, which yielded the largest cross-sectional area. Standard solid tumor criteria for response were used. All responding patients also had a stable or tapered dose of corticosteroids with stable or improved performance status and neurologic examination. There were four objective responses (12%): one complete remission (3 1/2+ years) and three partial remissions (57, 86, and 322 days). Two patients had improvement in disease that did not meet requirements for a partial remission. Toxicity was mild and primarily consisted of nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. Two patients were removed from study due to neurotoxicity (depression and hallucinations). The strict response criteria used in this trial were not those that have been used in testing other active agents such as carmustine (BCNU). We conclude that AT-125 has objective antitumor activity in malignant astrocytomas and warrants further study.\r"

In the current study, 45 patients were randomized between a fixed dose of VP16 (125 mg/m2/d) versus individualized dosing to a target WBC nadir (WBCN) of 1,700/microL. The total dose was increased by an average of 22% in the latter patients (459 +/- 130 mg/m2 v 375 mg/m2, P = .002). This was associated with a decrease in both the mean WBCN (1,510 +/- 950 v 2,500 +/- 1,420/microL, P = .013) and in the variability of the WBCN (P = .039). The VP16 clearance (mL/min) was not correlated with body surface area. Partial responses were observed in one patient each with hepatoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We conclude that pharmacologically based dosing may be a means of increasing dose intensity without increasing the incidence of life-threatening toxicity due to a decrease in variability around a target WBC.\r"

  ".W": "Diaziquone (AZQ), a synthetic quinone with demonstrated activity against acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), primary CNS tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), is virtually devoid of nonhematopoietic toxicity at conventional doses. As a prelude to its inclusion into bone marrow transplant (BMT) preparative regimens, a phase I study of high-dose AZQ with autologous BMT (ABMT) was performed. Patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas were treated with a single 24-hour infusion of AZQ at 50 to 355 mg/m2 in dose escalations of 20%. Fifty-six patients received 69 courses. Those receiving greater than 60 mg/m2 had nadir granulocyte and platelet counts less than 500/microL and 20,000/microL, respectively. Nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and diarrhea were mild, transient, and not dose-related. Transient minimal elevations of liver function tests were seen in five patients and were also not dose-related. The maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of high-dose AZQ was found to be 245 mg/m2, with nephrotoxicity being dose-limiting. Significant azotemia was seen in four of 12 patients treated at 295 and 355 mg/m2, including fatal anuric renal failure in three of these patients. Reversible proteinuria also occurred in 24 of 26 courses above 150 mg/m2, including nephrotic range proteinuria in eight courses, all at doses of 205 to 355 mg/m2. The proteinuria was also associated with multiple proximal tubular defects including generalized aminoaciduria and proximal renal tubular acidosis. There were six early deaths including two of early renal failure (295 and 355 mg/m2), two of sepsis (205 and 245 mg/m2), one of a pulmonary embolus (85 mg/m2), and one of progressive disease (60 mg/m2). Of 50 patients who were assessable for response, there were seven responses including two of 10 with primary CNS tumors, one of 12 with malignant melanoma, one of five with non-small-cell lung carcinoma, two of two with breast carcinoma, and one of one with ovarian carcinoma. Because of its activity in ANLL and NHL and its unique toxicity spectrum, high-dose AZQ may improve the efficacy of current BMT preparative regimens without significantly increasing their nonhematopoietic toxicity.\r"

After accounting for differences in survival rate attributable to type of cancer, initial performance status, age, and 14 other protocol-specific prognostic indicators, the additional predictive value of socioeconomic status (SES) was evaluated. Race (white v non-white) was not a significant predictor of survival time, but income and education were. People with lower annual incomes (below $5,000 per year in the years 1977 to 1981) and those with lower educational level (grade school only) showed survival times significantly shorter than those with higher income or education, respectively. These survival differences were associated with, but could not be fully explained by, severity of disease at initial presentation. SES continued to exert a small but significant impact on cancer survival, even after controlling for all known prognostic variables. Economically and educationally disadvantaged cancer patients may require treatment programs that include education about treatment and compliance, even after an initial diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated. Because SES is related to survival independent of all known prognostic variables, it should be included in the data bases of clinical trial groups to provide a more accurate test of the effectiveness of new therapies.\r"

Despite growing interest in radiosurgery, the influence of the volume of brain irradiated on the tolerance of the brain to radiation is not well understood. The results of six studies reporting clinically significant radiation reactions following radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations are reviewed. In the combined series, 23 (9%) of 255 patients developed a clinically significant radiation reaction. The volume of brain irradiated and the dose delivered in each of these 23 patients are presented. The compiled data suggest that the previously presented guidelines may underestimate the risks of radiosurgery. Additional clinical and experimental data are needed to determine \"safe\" doses of radiation to be used during radiosurgery.\r"

The BUdR labeling index, or percentage of S-phase cells, was calculated in paraffin-embedded tumor sections after in situ labeling by intraoperative intravenous infusion of BUdR, 200 mg/sq m. Exponential regression analyses showed a positive correlation between the histological grade and labeling index (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) that was stronger than the correlations between log labeling index and age (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001) and between grade and age (r = 0.55, p less than 0.001).

Eight children who presented at birth with posterior cervical or cervicothoracic lumps, all of which represented a dysraphic state, are discussed. Two types of abnormalities were noted. Three patients had hydromyelia with an associated myelocystocele herniating posteriorly into a meningocele sac. In these three patients there was an associated Chiari II malformation and hydrocephalus. The other five children had a meningocele in which a band of tissue extended from the posterior aspect of the spinal cord through a defect in the bone and fascia to the posterior part of the meningocele sac itself. No patient had a lesion that could be described as a meningomyelocele. The investigation and surgical management of these conditions are discussed and the need for intradural exploration to untether the spinal cord in the cervical region is stressed.\r"

  ".W": "Although several large series of atlas fractures have been reported recently, none has concentrated on the evaluation and treatment of atlas burst fractures (Jefferson fractures). The treatment of this fracture is challenging. Its diagnosis may easily be missed due to concerns about associated trauma and absence of neurological signs. In addition, the open-mouth anteroposterior x-ray study, which is usually pathognomonic for the diagnosis, is often inadequate or not obtained. In order to clarify the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder, 17 cases of Jefferson fracture treated between 1982 and 1989 at the Louisiana State University Affiliated Hospitals are presented. The diagnosis was delayed in three patients because of a low index of suspicion and inadequate x-ray films. Four patients were noted to have unstable Jefferson fractures, all of these had an associated Type II odontoid fracture and were treated with occiput-C-2 wiring and fusion. The remainder of the patients had stable Jefferson fractures and were managed with Minerva jackets or rigid collar stabilization. No significant complications related to the treatment of the Jefferson fracture occurred in this series. One patient died from associated injuries; however, the remaining patients enjoyed an excellent long-term result with the acquisition of spinal stability and the resolution of subjective complaints.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty normal human subjects and 14 patients with upper cervical spine pathology were studied with axial high-field magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to examine the transverse atlantal ligament. Gradient-echo MR imaging pulse sequences provided reliable visualization of the transverse ligament, which exhibited low signal intensity and extended behind the dens between the medial portions of the lateral masses of C-1. The MR imaging characteristics of the transverse ligament were verified in clinical studies and in postmortem specimens. The clinical MR examinations defined 27 normal ligaments, three ligament disruptions, and four stretched rheumatoid ligaments. Atlantoaxial instability associated with transverse ligament rupture or ligamentous laxity required internal fixation. In contrast, fractures of C-1 or C-2 or atlantoaxial rotatory dislocations associated with an intact transverse ligament healed without instability or nonunion. The transverse ligament is the primary stabilizing component of C-1. The treatment of atlantoaxial instability has previously been based on criteria drawn from computerized tomography or plain radiographic studies, which only indirectly assess the probability of rupture of the transverse ligament. It is concluded that MR imaging accurately depicts the anatomical integrity of the transverse ligament. After transverse ligament failure, the remaining ligaments of the craniovertebral junction are inadequate to maintain stability. The presence of ligament disruption should be considered as a criterion for early fusion.\r"

Thirty-three patients had no other treatment and were followed up with angiography at 2 years and clinically from 2 to 6 years. Of the other 16 patients, 10 had adjunctive radiosurgery and six underwent surgical resection following embolization. Seven (14%) of the 49 patients had a morphological cure effected by embolization as evidenced on their 2-year follow-up angiograms: these have remained clinically stable. Twelve patients developed neurological deficits after embolization; eight (16% of the series) were transient and four (8%) were permanent. Two patients (4%) had a delayed hemorrhage after incomplete obliteration of their malformations. Endovascular treatment resulted in clinical improvement in 15 (33%) of the other 46 patients. None of the patients who initially presented with hemorrhage had a rebleed following embolization. It is concluded that endovascular treatment with liquid embolic material can be an integral part of the multidisciplinary treatment protocol for patients with brain AVM's.\r"

  ".W": "The authors report results obtained in 20 severely affected patients with Parkinson's disease (Grade IV or V) who received an autotransplant of perfused adrenal medullary tissue. This study seems to indicate that these autoimplants can improve the parkinsonian symptomatology and induce amelioration in the patients' performance of routine activities. All the symptoms analyzed showed improvement, although it differed in intensity and time of onset. Moreover, this improvement was accompanied by a reduction in the daily intake of L-dopa, with discontinuance of dopamine agonists and amantadine. A number of medical complications were encountered, including three deaths, probably related to performing abdominal surgery in seriously affected parkinsonian patients who were unable to tolerate the discontinuance of their medication. The transient psychiatric disorders observed appeared to be related to the postoperative dose of L-dopa and/or anticholinergic agents administered, and diminished or disappeared when the doses were reduced. The reasons for improvement, which was bilateral, remain unknown, although one cause may be the surgical trauma (minicaudotomy) together with the implantation of adrenal medullary tissue, which may promote the sprouting of surviving dopaminergic fibers. Moreover, in this series, perfusion of adrenal medulla increased the capacity for revascularization of the tissue and may have reduced the damaging effects of warm ischemia on the cells. This, together with the existence of fenestrated vessels, could hypothetically have served as an access point for drugs, and if the implanted cells were viable, they might have served to store and manufacture different factors and/or transmitters. These results as well as those of other groups justify the development of a controlled international clinical trial.\r"

It has been demonstrated that stimulation of the infraorbital nerve trunk gives rise to very reliable scalp responses reflecting the activity of the afferent pathway between the maximally nerve and the brain stem. The authors demonstrate that alterations of such trigeminal evoked responses fit with documented pathological processes at various locations along the trigeminal pathway (maxillary sinus, parasellar region, and within the brain-stem parenchyma). They report the findings in 68 patients suffering from \"idiopathic\" trigeminal neuralgia. Alterations of the response were detected in 33 cases, suggesting that some damage of the nerve had taken place either at the root entry zone into the pons (23 cases) or slightly distal to it (10 cases). Such results support the hypothesis that trigeminal neuralgia may be due to a compression of the trigeminal root at the pons entry zone.\r"

  ".W": "Prediction tree techniques are employed in the analysis of data from 555 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia hospitals with severe head injuries. Twenty-three prognostic indicators are examined to predict the distribution of 12-month outcomes among the five Glasgow Outcome Scale categories. A tree diagram, illustrating the prognostic pattern, provides critical threshold levels that split the patients into subgroups with varying degrees of risk. It is a visually useful way to look at the prognosis of head-injured patients. In previous analyses addressing this prediction problem, the same set of prognostic factors (age, motor score, and pupillary response) was used for all patients. These approaches might be considered inflexible because more informative prediction may be achieved by somewhat different combinations of factors for different patients. Tree analysis reveals that the pattern of important prognostic factors differs among various patient subgroups, although the three previously mentioned factors are still of primary importance. For example, it is noted that information concerning intracerebral lesions is useful in predicting outcome for certain patients. The overall predictive accuracy of the tree technique for these data is 77.7%, which is somewhat higher than that obtained via standard prediction methods. The predictive accuracy is highest among patients who have a good recovery or die; it is lower for patients having intermediate outcomes.\r"

Of these 211 patients, 89 (42.2%) had brain contusion/hematoma, 46 (21.8%) an epidural hematoma, 35 (16.6%) a subdural hematoma, and 41 (19.4%) did not show focal mass lesions. Thus, four of every five patients who deteriorated into coma after suffering an apparently nonsevere head injury had a mass lesion potentially requiring surgery: the mass was intracerebral in 52.3% of the cases and extracerebral in 47.6%. Patients aged 20 years or less had a 39% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion (diffuse brain damage), a 29% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 32% chance of having an intradural mass lesion; patients over 40 years had only a 3% chance of having a nonfocal mass lesion, an 18% chance of having an epidural hematoma, and a 79% chance of having a intradural mass lesion. Sixty-eight (32.2%) patients died and 143 (67.8%) survived. The following were independent outcome predictors (in order of significance): Glasgow Coma Scale score following deterioration into coma, the highest intracranial pressure during the patient's course, the degree of midline shift, the type of intracranial lesion, and the age of the patient. In contrast, the mechanism of injury, the verbal Glasgow Coma Scale score during the lucid interval, and the length of time until deterioration or until operative intervention did not influence the final result.\r"

Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is an angiogenic factor as well as a potent mitogen for a number of cell types including vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. In order to test the possibility that basic FGF takes part in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease, the authors tested for the presence of this factor using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant basic FGF. The surgical specimens studied included two sections of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and four samples of dura mater from four patients with moyamoya disease. Surgical specimens were obtained from three patients with other diseases as control tissue. Sections of the STA obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease showed strong basic FGF immunoreactivity in endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, while control sections had only faint and scattered immunoreactivity. All sections of the dura mater obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease also revealed more intense immunohistochemical staining of basic FGF in meningeal and vascular cells than did control sections. These observations indicate that the amount of basic FGF is increased in the tissues of patients with moyamoya disease; thus, basic FGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease.\r"

First, the pulsed-dye laser was applied intravascularly via a 320-microns fiber to basilar artery segments from six dogs. The segments were mounted in a vessel-perfusion apparatus and constricted to, on average, 70% of resting diameter by superfusion with dog hemolysate. Immediate increase in basilar artery diameter occurred to a mean of 83% of control. In a second model, the basilar artery was exposed transclivally in the rabbit. In three normal animals, superfusion of the artery with rabbit hemolysate resulted in a reduction of mean vessel diameter to 81% of control. Following extravascular application of the laser, vessels returned to an average of 106% of the resting state. In six rabbits, the basilar artery was constricted by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood. 3 days apart. Two to 4 days after the second injection, the basilar artery was exposed. Extravascular laser treatment from a quartz fiber placed perpendicular to the vessel adventitia resulted in an immediate 53% average increase in caliber to an estimated 107% of control. No reconstriction was observed over a period of up to 5 hours. Morphologically, damage to the arterial wall was slight. This preliminary investigation suggests that the 1-microsecond pulsed-dye laser may be of benefit in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.\r"

  ".W": "Three ACNU-resistant clones (R1, R3, and R12) were isolated from 9L rat glioma cells under selection pressure of ACNU in vitro. The authors have investigated the mechanisms of resistance and characteristics of these clones at the cellular level by studying cross-resistance patterns to chemical and physical agents. Although these resistant sublines showed complete cross-resistance to methyl-chloroethylnitrosourea (MCNU), no cross-resistance was observed for other alkylating agents, while each of the resistant sublines showed partial cross-resistance to structurally dissimilar toxic agents (vinblastine, Adriamycin, and VP-16). No difference in ACNU uptake was observed between 9L and R3 cells, and resistance patterns among alkylating agents suggested that the mechanism of ACNU resistance was specific to bifunctional nitrosoureas. Based on a transport study, this multidrug resistance could be explained by reduced intracellular uptake of these drugs, but there seemed little possibility that membrane P-glycoprotein, which usually is observed in typical multidrug-resistant cells, was expressed in these ACNU-resistant cells because enhanced drug efflux was not found in ACNU-resistant sublines. Significant collateral sensitivity to L-asparaginase indicated that ACNU might disturb the asparagine synthetic pathways by its mutagenic action. The increased level of total glutathione in the resistant sublines may be one mechanism of radiation or ACNU resistance.\r"

  ".U": "91303230\r", 
  ".W": "The proliferation of many nonglial tumors in vitro depends on the presence of nanomolar concentrations of one or more growth factors. To define the growth factor requirements of malignant glial tumors, the authors examined the response properties of four low-passage human malignant glioma lines to the following mitogens: epidermal growth factor (EGF), acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (FGF's), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), 12-O-tetradecanoyl-13-phorbol acetate (TPA), and serum. Each of the tumors showed increased deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis (assessed by acid-precipitable [3H]-thymidine incorporation) in response to PDGF with a maximum effect at 50 ng/ml. Three tumors responded to EGF, three to IGF-I, two to acidic FGF, two to basic FGF, and two to TPA with maximum effects at 10, 50, 1, 1, and 10 ng/ml, respectively. None of the tumors responded to NGF. In the responsive tumors, optimum concentrations of EGF, IGF, TPA, acidic FGF, and basic FGF induced, at most, a two- to fourfold increase in [3H]-thymidine incorporation, which was only 30% to 50% of the response seen in 10% serum. In contrast, PDGF increased DNA synthesis eight- to 10-fold, equaling the effect of 10% serum. Measurements of cell proliferation also demonstrated a significant response to PDGF in each of the tumors. Appropriate concentrations of an anti-PDGF neutralizing antibody inhibited baseline DNA synthesis and proliferation in the absence of added growth factors, suggesting the possible role of PDGF in autocrine stimulation of these cells. However, this antibody produced only slight inhibition of serum-induced mitogenesis. Trapidil, an agent reported to inhibit the effects of PDGF, and polymyxin B, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, strongly inhibited baseline as well as PDGF- and serum-induced mitogenesis. It is concluded that, in the malignant gliomas studied, PDGF may be acting as a dominant mitogen to enhance DNA synthesis, and may function in autocrine stimulation. However, other factors contained in serum can also contribute to cell division.\r"

The bow-shaped canal through which courses the abducens nerve before reaching the cavernous sinus is located inside a venous confluence which occupies the space between the dural leaves of the petroclival area. The petrosphenoidal ligament (Gruber's ligament), which forms the posteromedial wall of the canal, appears as a fibrous trabecula surrounded by venous blood. Canal measurements were performed and its anatomical relationship with the sixth cranial nerve is described. Angulations of variable degrees were observed in the course of the nerve inside and outside the canal. The influence of this relatively tortuous course of the abducens nerve upon its vulnerability in some pathological conditions is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The foramen caecum (FC) is a triangular-shaped fossa situated in the midline on the base of the brain stem, at the pontomedullary junction. Although this area is known to have a very high concentration of brainstem perforating vessels, its microvascular anatomy has not been studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to detail the microvasculature of this territory. Twenty unfixed brains were injected with silicone rubber solution and dissected under a microscope equipped with a camera. The origin, course, outer diameter, and branching pattern of the perforators were examined. The total number of perforators found in the 20 brains was 287, with an average (+/- standard deviation) of 14.35 +/- 1.24 perforators per brain (range seven to 28). Their origin was as follows: right vertebral artery in 52 perforators (18.11%); left vertebral artery in 35 (12.19%); basilar artery below the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) in 139 (48.43%); basilar artery above the AICA in 46 (16.02%); AICA in 10 (3.48%); and anterior spinal artery in five (1.74%). Most of the perforators arose as sub-branches of larger trunks; their average outer diameter was 0.16 +/- 0.006 mm while that of trunks was 0.35 +/- 0.02 mm. These anatomical data are important for those wishing 1) to study the pathophysiology of vascular insults to this area caused by atheromas, thrombi, and emboli; 2) to plan vertebrobasilar aneurysm surgery; 3) to plan surgery for vertebrobasilar insufficiency; and 4) to study foramen magnum neoplasms.\r"

These agents were employed more frequently prior to the routine use of the operating microscope and the presently available variety of aneurysm clips. One such coating agent is methyl methacrylate. This report describes a patient with an anterior communicating aneurysm that rebled 20 years after being encased in methyl methacrylate. At operation, the pulsating aneurysm had eroded the adjacent layer of methyl methacrylate, creating a small intervening space. This space allowed removal under the microscope (with a high-speed air drill and a diamond bit) of the methyl methacrylate from the anterior cerebral arteries and aneurysm, exposing it for definitive clip placement. The feasibility of clipping encased aneurysms is discussed.\r"

Neurological signs and symptoms were extremity dysesthesias, paresthesias, and weakness. Plain cervical and lumbothoracic x-ray films were normal for the patients' age. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a rounded cystic intramedullary mass at the thoracolumbar junction in two cases and at C3-7 in one case. The signal intensity of the cyst contents approximated that of cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images. Upon administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), MR imaging showed no enhancement in the cyst wall or cavity. Myelotomy and cyst drainage were performed in each case, and the neurological status of each patient improved. The lining of the cyst was biopsied in one of the three patients undergoing surgery and was composed of a single layer of cuboidal cells supported by glial tissue. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of the tissue did not reveal a basement membrane. The findings in these cases suggest that the Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging appearance of intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst is consistent and allows for accurate preoperative diagnosis with or without biopsy.\r"

On presentation for surgery, levels of anxiety as well as heart rate and presence of cardiac arrhythmias were determined for the two groups. Patients who received the study medication had an anxiety level on the day of surgery similar to that recorded at an earlier consultation visit, whereas the placebo group showed a tendency toward an increase in anxiety on the day of surgery. There was a significant difference for resting heart rate between the two groups at various intervals associated with the preparation for the surgery. There were no complications related to the medication and, therefore, on the basis of this study, it appears that the administration of an oral anxiolytic agent prior to the patient presenting for surgery is beneficial in reducing the stress and anxiety associated with the operation as well as in reducing some of the cardiac manifestations of this stress.\r"

These findings were a lack or correlation between increasing age and the stages of the process; the percentage of patients in the third stage (closed lock) with limited opening (less than 25 mm) too severe to be caused solely by a nonreducible, displaced disc; the unexpectedly high incidence (greater than 50%) of normally shaped discs in the third stage of the process. A specific condition of severe and stubborn limited maximal mouth opening caused by total cessation of gliding, liable to occur at any age and unrelated to disc shape or position, which responds successfully to simple treatment by lavage and lysis, pressured injection, or arthrocentesis, was discerned. Lack of gliding was attributed to adherence of the disc to the fossa by a reversible effect such as a vacuum and/or decreased volume of synovial fluid of high viscosity. This condition was deemed worthy of an independent identity, dissociated from disc displacement, as a causative factor in the second and third stages of ID, and particularly as an aid to accurate diagnosis and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "This study evaluated the morphogenetic properties of osteogenic composites of bone matrix and porous coralline hydroxyapatite (HA) replicas after intramuscular implantation in adult baboons (Papio ursinus). Composite implants were prepared by inserting rods of nonresorbable HA replicas, 20 mm in length, and 5 or 7 mm in diameter, into the medullary canals of 90 diaphyseal baboon bone cylinders, 20 mm in height, sequentially extracted and chemosterilized to obtain autolysed antigen-extracted allogeneic (AAA) bone matrix, preserving the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) activity. Composites were implanted in the rectus abdominis and in the dorsal musculature of 24 adult male baboons. Before implantation, 45 composites were coated with an allogeneic fibrin-fibronectin protein concentrate (AFFP) prepared from fresh-frozen baboon plasma. Histologic analysis of undecalcified and decalcified specimens procured at 3, 6, and 9 months showed bone differentiation by induction along the endosteal surfaces of the chemosterilized matrix and within the porous spaces of the HA substratum. Bone formation was often extensive, culminating in complete penetration of the porous spaces. Histomorphometry showed that bone in the HA substratum increased at each time period. The biochemical treatment of the composite implants with AFFP did increase significantly the amount of induced bone, although only in the HA substratum. Bone differentiation was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of the mineralization fronts after intravital double tetracycline labeling. The differentiation of bone in composites of bone matrix and porous HA replicas in extraskeletal sites of adult baboons may help to design appropriate delivery systems for the controlled therapeutic initiation of bone formation for craniofacial and orthopedic applications in man.\r"

Thirty-seven Chinese adults whose class III malocclusion was treated either with an intraoral ramus (group A) or an anterior subapical (group B) osteotomy were selected for the study. Serial lateral cephalograms taken presurgically (T1) and at least 6 months postrentention (T2), showed marked improvement in the soft-tissue profile in both groups. Although the percentage response of soft- to hard-tissue movement was similar at lebrale inferius, the response at soft-tissue point B was found to be statistically less in group B than in group A (P less than .05). Although the correlation between the upper lip response to mandibular ramus setback in group A was weak (r = 0.11), there appeared to be a relatively strong correlation between posterior movement of the upper lip and the magnitude of the lower segmental setback (r = 0.65). The differences in soft- to hard-tissue response with the two osteotomy procedures appear to vary with those reported in whites. This study emphasizes the need for different prediction ratios of soft- to hard-tissue movement in different racial types.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine factors predictive of clinical outcome for pediatric patients with maxillofacial infections. Using linear logistic regression, four important variables, age, admission temperature, admission white blood cell count, and source of infection, were identified. Relevant study variables were abstracted from the records of all children less than 15 years old admitted to San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) with facial infections between 1982 and 1986 (n = 105). An unfavorable clinical outcome was defined as a length of hospital stay (LOS) greater than or equal to 4 days and/or the need for an operation to resolve the infection. A favorable outcome was a LOS less than 4 days and no operation. To develop and validate the linear logistic model, the original group of patients (n = 105) was divided into index and validation sets. The index set was created by randomly selecting 80 of the original patients. The model was then applied to a validation set of the 25 remaining children. The model predicted that 13.95 of the patients in the validation set would have an unfavorable outcome. The actual number of unfavorable outcomes was 16. To further test the model's validity, a third data set was collected. It was composed of pediatric patients admitted to SFGH between January 1, 1987 and June 30, 1989 (n = 24). The model predicted that 15.99 of these patients would have an unfavorable outcome; 17 patients actually did have an unfavorable outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was shown that the cancer group had statistically higher sialic acid levels than control group and the group with benign disease (P less than .05), but no significant difference was noted between the normal control group and the patients with benign tumor (P greater than .05). Serum sialic acid levels were significantly higher in the patients with stages III and IV cancer than in those individuals with stage I and II cancer, but no differences were seen between stages I and II, and between stages III and IV cancer patients (P greater than .05). There was also no difference when considering the anatomic site of the malignant lesion. Furthermore, during the serial sialic acid determination in cancer patients before and following treatment, the sialic acid levels usually declined with remission of the disease and increased with recurrence, metastasis, or a poor prognosis. We conclude from this study that the sequential measurement of sialic acid level is particularly useful in monitoring patients with oral cancer, and sialic acid may prove to be a valuable tumor marker in oral and maxillofacial malignancy.\r"

Tissue expanders were introduced into the fascial plane beneath the panniculus muscle of the rat and expanded in a stepwise fashion. Biopsies were taken at 48, 96, and 144 hours postexpansion at each increased pressure level. The developing capsule exhibited an increase in mitotic activity in its innermost layer, which reached a maximum 96 hours postexpansion. Application of constant pressure beyond 96 hours resulted in a progressive decrease in mitotic activity of the capsule. These observations suggest that cell proliferation and the resulting growth and differentiation of the extracellular matrix of the capsule may be controlled by appropriate pressure changes in the expander.\r"

In these studies, the survival at 3 to 5 years has been generally 40% to 50%. Several trials using chemotherapy after standard therapy, however, have reported survival benefits of 10% to 20%, suggested that further evaluation of classic adjuvant chemotherapy in this disease is warranted. Among studies in recurrent head and neck cancer, the most effective chemotherapy regimens appear to be variations of the program consisting of cisplatin followed by a 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Nevertheless, median survivals in recurrent disease remain short, generally 5 to 10 months.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate whether the renal sympathetic nerves contribute to the compensatory Na reabsorption observed during furosemide-induced volume contraction, furosemide was administered as constant i.v. infusion (7.5 mg/kg/h) in trained, chronically instrumented rats with or without guanethidine-induced peripheral sympathectomy. In addition, the effect of acute instrumentation was evaluated by measuring renal function before and after furosemide infusion in control rats recovering from surgery and halothane anesthesia. Lithium clearance was used as a marker for proximal tubular Na reabsorption, and [3H]inulin and [14C]tetraethylammonium were used as markers for the glomerular filtration rate and the effective renal plasma flow, respectively. Control values in chronically instrumented sympathectomized rats did not differ from values obtained in chronically instrumented control rats. In acutely instrumented control rats the control value for effective renal plasma flow was 20% lower than in both chronically instrumented groups; this was associated with increased arterial blood pressure and increased renal vascular resistance. There were no differences in the diuretic or the natriuretic furosemide response between chronically instrumented control and chronically instrumented sympathectomized rats, whereas the diuretic and natriuretic responses were reduced in acutely instrumented control rats. This was due to an accentuation of the initial fall in glomerular filtration rate during furosemide infusion. In control animals, either acutely or chronically instrumented, fractional Li excretion increased from 30% to 50% during furosemide peak response, after which it returned toward control values. In sympathectomized rats, the fractional Li excretion increased from 36% to 70% during furosemide peak response, after which it decreased to a steady-state value of 56%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because these agents also are serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, which can promote gastric emptying in some species, the motor-stimulating properties of benzamide agents may be due to this mechanism. Metoclopramide (0.3-3.0 mg/kg i.v.), cisapride (0.03-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) and BRL-24924 (0.01-0.1 mg/kg i.v.) were evaluated for their relative motility-stimulating and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist activities in conscious dogs and were compared with selective 5-HT3 antagonist antiemetic compounds ICS-205-930, (3 alpha-tropanyl)1-H-indole-3-carboxylic acid ester and granisetron (BRL-43694). Gastric antral contractions and intestinal myoelectric motility were determined in response to drugs, as were their effects on solid and liquid emptying in a gamma scintigraphic model of gastroparesis. 5-HT3 receptor antagonist potency was examined by deriving ED50 values for inhibition of cisplatin emesis. All drugs were 5-HT3 antagonists as they blocked cisplatin emesis with relative potencies of BRL-43694 = ICS-205-930 greater than BRL-24924 greater than cisapride = metoclopramide. The order of potency for stimulating fasted dog antral contractile activity, however, was BRL-24924 = cisapride greater than metoclopramide greater than ICS-205-930 = BRL-43694. Maximally effective doses of BRL-24924 (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) and cisapride (0.67 mg/kg i.v.) in the antrum also stimulated intestinal myoelectrical activity, whereas ICS-205-930 (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg i.v.) was not active.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Studies were performed in pentobarbital anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats to determine whether mu opioid receptor agonists produce changes in renal function via intrarenal mechanisms. Left renal artery infusion of isotonic saline vehicle or the selective mu opioid receptor agonist, dermorphin (0.5 nmol/kg/min), did not alter mean arterial pressure or heart rate. In contrast, left renal artery dermorphin administration produced a significant decrease in left kidney urinary flow rate and sodium excretion without altering glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow; function of the right kidney was unaffected. Pretreatment of the left kidney with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, 50 micrograms/kg into left renal artery, prevented changes in urinary flow rate and sodium excretion induced by subsequent left renal artery dermorphin administration. Prior bilateral renal denervation abolished the antidiuretic and antinatriuretic responses to left renal artery dermorphin administration. These results suggest that mu opioid receptor agonists participate in the process of renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption via an intrarenal action that is dependent on an interaction with renal sympathetic nerves. This may occur via an action of mu opioid receptor agonists to facilitate the nerve terminal release and/or the direct tubular action of norepinephrine to affect renal tubular sodium and water reabsorption.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigated whether blockade of conditioned avoidance responding (CAR) in rats by selective D1 and D2 receptor antagonists could be differentially affected by anticholinergics. The results show that atropine and scopolamine dose-relatedly antagonized the effects on CAR of two specific D2 receptor blockers, haloperidol and raclopride, but potentiated the effects of three specific D1 receptor antagonists, SCH 23390, SCH 39166 and NO-01-0756. Of the less specific dopamine receptor antagonists tested, scopolamine blocked the effects of clozapine and cis-flupenthixol, but did not alter the effects of chlorpromazine, thioridazine or cis-piflutixol. Although the mechanisms involved in the differential shifts by the anticholinergics are unknown, the results are consistent with the view that CAR antagonism by the specific D2 vs. D1 receptor antagonists involves unique and separate mechanisms of action. With respect to the less specific dopamine receptor antagonists, the CAR blockade seen with clozapine and cis-flupenthixol might reflect predominant D2 receptor blockade because their effects were blocked by atropine. In contrast, the CAR blockade by chlorpromazine, thioridazine and cis-piflutixol antagonists might be mediated by equal degrees of D1 and D2 receptor blockade inasmuch as they were not blocked or potentiated by atropine. The antagonism of CAR in rats by the D1 receptor antagonists suggests that these drugs have potential antipsychotic activity in humans. However, they do not appear to enhance central cholinergic transmission and therefore may be devoid of the side effects produced by the antipsychotics in clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "The synthetic steroid anesthetic alphaxalone (3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-11,20-dione) was studied in two behavioral paradigms known to be sensitive to anxiolytic drugs. In an elevated plus maze, alphaxalone produced an anxiolytic profile, significantly increasing the percentage of entries made into the open arms as well as the percentage of time spent on the open arms. In the conflict test, alphaxalone (6 and 8 mg/kg) produced a significant dose-dependent increase in punished responding and a decrease (8 mg/kg) in unpunished responding. The pattern of responding was similar to that observed with the benzodiazepine agonist chlordiazepoxide (2-8 mg/kg). The increase in punished responding was not altered by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 and only partially blocked by the picrotoxinin receptor ligand isopropylbicyclophospate (10 and 15 micrograms/kg). The gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists picrotoxin (1 mg/kg) and bicuculline (1 mg/kg) also failed to suppress the rate-increasing effects of alphaxalone in the conflict test. Chronic administration of alphaxalone for 1 week produced no tolerance to the anxiolytic behavioral effects. In addition, no changes in pain threshold were noted with alphaxalone (8 mg/kg) in the tail-flick analgesia test. These results suggest that the pharmacologic substrates for the anxiolytic actions of alphaxalone may be independent of either the benzodiazepine or picrotoxinin binding sites of the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor complex.\r"

Although mean systolic blood pressure (measured by tail cuff plethysmography) was slightly higher in the SHR, this difference was not significant. Slopes and maximum responses were increased significantly for nerve stimulation and all agonists. The basal perfusion pressure was also significantly elevated in the SHR. These differences are consistent with existing evidence that structural changes occur in blood vessels of SHR at an early stage and probably precede development of hypertension. Such structural changes could therefore contribute to development of the hypertension. Cocaine (1 microM) markedly increased responses to nerve stimulation and bolus injections of norepinephrine in preparations from SHR with little or no effect on such responses in Wistar Kyoto preparations, a result consistent with the known greater density of noradrenergic nerves in SHR vasculature. In the presence of cocaine, there was unmasked a selective super-sensitivity (significantly lower ED50) to norepinephrine in the SHR. Thus SHR mesenteric vessels may possess an alteration in adrenoreceptors or their coupling to other cellular mechanisms. Responses to ACh revealed no indication of a deficient endothelial mediated relaxation. An altered media:lumen ratio of small arteries, hypernoradrenergic innervation and supersensitivity to the transmitter may contribute to development of hypertension.\r"

Ten patients with gastroparesis, documented by abnormal solid phase radionuclide gastric emptying study, were treated with 10 mg (2 ml) of s.c. metoclopramide every 6 hr for 3 days. Patients gave themselves the injections as outpatients. Questionnaires were then completed concerning symptom relief, local side effects and adverse reactions. A repeat gastric emptying study was obtained immediately after the last dose of metoclopramide. Serum metoclopramide concentrations were obtained at trough, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 hr postadministration and serum prolactin levels at trough, 1 and 3 hr. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed mean peak metoclopramide concentration at 30 min of 99.7 +/- 47.1 ng/ml with measured levels of 93.9 +/- 106.83 ng/ml at 60 min and return to trough values by 4 hr; trough prolactins remained elevated above normal values. Gastric stasis improved from a base-line retention of 78.7% of radioisotope at 2 hr to 72.5% after 3 days of therapy (P = .65). Eight patients reported significant improvement in symptomology and two patients reported lessening of symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, heartburn and vomiting. The side effects were minimal and did not interfere with completion of the protocol. We demonstrated that s.c. administration of metoclopramide was well accepted by patients and resulted in subjective and objective improvement of gastric stasis. In addition, serum metoclopramide concentrations were comparable with other parenteral routes of administration. Furthermore, serum prolactin levels may provide both a bioassay of efficacy and a marker for monitoring compliance.\r"

Effects of the protein kinase C activator 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (4 beta-PDB) on electrically evoked [3H]NE release were investigated in rabbit and rat hippocampus. Release evoked with 4 pulses/100 Hz (POP stimulation; i.e. under conditions virtually free of autoinhibition), was increased by 4 beta-PDB in a comparable manner in both species. Conversely, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist clonidine diminished POP-induced [3H]NE release in a concentration-dependent manner. The net effects of clonidine were of a similar magnitude up to near maximal concentrations, irrespective of whether or not the 4 beta-PDB was present. Correspondingly, the net effect of 4 beta-PDB remained unchanged under these conditions. An impairment of the net effect of 4 beta-PDB was only seen at higher concentrations of clonidine. Concurrent addition of the alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine and 4 beta-PDB enhanced release elicited with 36 pulses/3 Hz (i.e., in presence of autoinhibition), in a manner which was at least additive. Taken together, the above data exclude a direct link between presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors and protein kinase C and restrict a functional interaction to very distinctive conditions.\r"

Based on biophysical characteristics and sensitivity to omega-conotoxin GVIA and dihydropyridine agonists and antagonists, voltage-activated Ba++ currents (IBa) in PC12 cells were mediated by N- and L-type Ca++ channels. Addition of MeHg (10 microM) to the extracellular solution caused a rapid and complete block of current carried by 20 mM Ba++. The rate of block of IBa by MeHg increased in a concentration-dependent manner between 1 and 20 microM. Increasing the frequency of stimulation from 0.1 to 0.4 Hz facilitated block of IBa by MeHg. A 2-min application of 10 microM MeHg in the absence of stimulation also reduced IBa by approximately 80%. Thus, block of IBa by MeHg is not state-dependent. Additionally, MeHg blocked IBa when the membrane holding potential was -40, -70 and -90 mV, indicating that both N- and L-type Ca++ channels are blocked by MeHg. Block of IBa by MeHg was voltage-dependent at a membrane holding potential of -40 mV, but not at holding potentials of -70 and -90 mV. Decreasing the extracellular concentration of Ba++ ([Ba++]e) from 20 mM to 10 mM increased the magnitude of block by MeHg from 45.6 to 77.3%. Increasing [Ba++]e to 30 mM caused no further antagonism of block. Block of IBa by MeHg was not reversed by washing with MeHg-free solution. The ionic permeability of PC12 cell Ca++ channels was Ca++ = Sr++ greater than Ba++. In the presence of MeHg, all three divalent cations were equally permeant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Clonidine, oxymetazoline, phentolamine and naphazoline or the phenethylamine, phenylephrine, interacted with high- and low-affinity sites labeled by [3H]prazosin. SZL-49 (1-1000 nM) eliminated the high-affinity sites and caused a significant reduction of the low-affinity sites. CEC (1-100 microM) reduced the number of low-affinity sites, while the effect on high-affinity sites was dependent on the route of administration. In control aortic rings the dose-response curves for either clonidine or naphazoline were biphasic, consisting of high- and low-affinity components. Only the high-affinity component was blocked by prazosin. SZL-49 was more potent than CEC at inhibiting agonist-induced contraction of rat aortic rings. The agonist responses obtained after treatment with either SZL-49 or CEC were only weakly antagonized by prazosin. The combination of SZL-49 and CEC produced no greater inhibition of muscle contraction than did SZL-49 alone. These data show that 1) imidazolines interact with different affinity at sites labeled by [3H]prazosin and these sites correspond to the alpha-1a and alpha-1b adrenoceptor subtype designation; 2) imidazolines induce smooth muscle contraction by interacting at high- and low-affinity sites; 3) these low-affinity sites do not appear to have properties of an alpha-1 adrenoceptor; 4) there may be three sites of interaction for imidazolines on the aorta, the alpha-1a and alpha-1b adrenoceptors and a site that does not have alpha-1 adrenoceptor characteristics.\r"

In addition, several PC analogs were synthesized and evaluated as prodrugs of 6-mercaptopurine by determining the concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine and its metabolites, 6-methylmercaptopurine and 6-thiouric acid, in urine after rats were given the analogs. At 30 min after PC treatments, kidney metabolite concentrations were dependent on the PC dose at 40 to 130 mumol/kg and were not increased when a 400 mumol PC/kg dose was given. At the 400 mumol PC/kg dose, metabolite concentrations in the kidneys were higher at 30 min than at 1 or 3 hr, and were nearly 2.5- and 100-fold higher than those in liver and plasma, respectively. Rates of PC in vitro metabolism by liver and kidney cytosolic cysteine conjugate beta-lyases (beta-lyases) were similar, but metabolism by renal mitochondrial beta-lyase occurred at a 3-fold higher rate than the rate obtained with hepatic mitochondrial beta-lyase. When rats were given aminooxyacetic acid (500 mumol/kg) or probenecid (270 mumol/kg) before PC (130 mumol/kg), total kidney metabolite concentrations were reduced by 55 and 36%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Both drugs exhibited similar pharmacological profiles; intermediate doses increased response rates markedly and higher doses decreased response rates below control values. The magnitude of the rate-increasing effect was similar for cocaine and GBR 12909, although cocaine was approximately 3 times more potent. In contrast, the direct-acting dopamine agonists, SKF 38393 and quinpirole, produced only decreases in response rates. When cocaine and GBR 12909 were studied in combination with dopamine antagonists, the effects of either on fixed-interval performance were attenuated in a similar manner by a D1-selective antagonist (SCH 23390) and a D2-selective antagonist (spiperone), indicating the involvement of both D1 and D2 receptor subtypes. In contrast, an alpha 1-selective antagonist (prazosin) did not alter the dose-effect curve for cocaine or GBR 12909 in a manner that indicated a pharmacological antagonism. When doses of cocaine were administered in combination with GBR 12909, the effects on behavior were additive. However, the combined effects of cocaine and SKF 38393 or cocaine and quinpirole were more complex and did not appear to be additive. When the cocaine or GBR 12909 was self-administered under a second-order, fixed-interval schedule of drug injection, schedule-appropriate responding was maintained and the potency difference between the two drugs was comparable to that observed under the stimulus-termination schedule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91303388\r", 
  ".W": "The stimulus parameters needed for the release of endogenous opioid peptides were investigated using an in vitro radioligand displacement assay in living guinea pig hippocampal slices. Electrical stimulation of the enkephalin-containing fibers in the perforant path caused the release of endogenous opioid peptides and the subsequent displacement of [3H]-[D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,glyol5]enkephalin binding. High frequency trains of stimuli (10 Hz for 1 sec every 10 sec) were more effective than lower frequency stimulation (1 Hz continuous) at evoking opioid peptide release. Having identified an effective stimulation paradigm able to release endogenous opioids, the electrophysiological effects of endogenous opioids on CA3 pyramidal cells were measured in the guinea pig hippocampal slice preparation. Unlike exogenously applied opioids, stimulated release of endogenous opioid peptides from the perforant path did not significantly reduce inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells. However, perforant path stimulation in the presence of naloxone did cause a dramatic increase in IPSP amplitudes. CA3 pyramidal cells were not directly affected by perforant path stimulation. The naloxone-sensitive increase in IPSPs was delayed 3 min in onset and lasted for several minutes. In addition, the increase in the IPSPs was specifically blocked either by the beta adrenergic antagonist propranolol or by pretreating the animals with reserpine. These findings indicate that endogenous opioids regulate the effects of norepinephrine in the CA3 region of the guinea pig hippocampus. In addition, endogenously released norepinephrine appeared to act on GABAergic interneurons to increase the amplitude of the IPSP recorded in CA3 pyramidal cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cationization of proteins in general enhances the cellular uptake of these macromolecules, and cationized antibodies are known to retain antigen binding properties. Therefore, cationized antibodies may be therapeutic and allow for \"intracellular immunization.\" The present studies test the hypothesis that the tissue uptake of cationized immunoglobulin G (IgG) after intravenous administration may be greatly increased relative to the uptake of native proteins. The pharmacokinetics of cationized immunoglobulin G clearance from blood, and the volume of distribution of the cationized or native protein (albumin, IgG) for 10 organs was measured both in anesthetized rats and in an anesthetized adult Macaca irus cynomologous monkey. Initial studies on brain showed that serum factors inhibited uptake of 125I-cationized IgG, but not 3H-cationized IgG. The blood-brain barrier permeability surface area product for 3H-cationized IgG was 0.57 +/- 0.04 microliters min-1 g-1. The ratio of the volume of distribution of the 3-H-cationized IgG compared to 3H-labeled native albumin ranged from 0.9 (testis) to 15.7 (spleen) in the rat at 3 hr after injection, and a similarly enhanced organ uptake was observed in the primate. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that cationization of immunoglobulin greatly increases organ uptake of the plasma protein compared to native immunoglobulins, and suggest that cationization of monoclonal antibodies may represent a potential new strategy for enhancing the intracellular delivery of these proteins.\r"

  ".W": "Fenoldopam [6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2, 3,4,5-tetrahydro-(1H)-3-benzazepine] is a selective dopamine-1 (DA1) agonist with natriuretic/diuretic properties. A component of the natriuretic response to fenoldopam may involve direct DA1 receptor-mediated effects on proximal tubule sodium reabsorption, possibly through stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Here, we compared the effects of fenoldopam and DA in stimulating cyclic AMP (cAMP) synthesis in LLC-PK1 cells, a renal epithelial cell line that has proximal tubule-like properties and expresses a DA1 receptor linked to stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. Fenoldopam stimulated cAMP accumulation in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, an effect which could be blocked by the DA1-selective antagonist Sch 23390. Although fenoldopam was more potent than DA (EC50 55.5 +/- 7.75 nM vs. 1.65 +/- 0.64 microM) in stimulating cAMP accumulation in LLC-PK1 cells, the maximum stimulation obtained by fenoldopam was only 37% of the maximum stimulation obtained by DA(Emax 13.0 +/- 2.95 pmol/mg of protein vs. 35.6 +/- 10.19 pmol/mg of protein). Simultaneous incubation of DA and fenoldopam resulted in lower cAMP levels than with DA alone. Incubation of DA with increasing concentrations of fenoldopam produced parallel rightward shifts in the DA dose-response curves. Schild analysis further indicated that fenoldopam acted as a competitive antagonist in the presence of DA, with a pA2 value of 7.38 and a slope of unity. These results indicate that fenoldopam is a partial agonist with low efficacy at DA1 receptors linked to cAMP generation in the LLC-PK1 cells.\r"

LTD4 produced a positive inotropic response; however, rapid desensitization required the construction of noncumulative dose-response curves to naive tissues. The maximal inotropic response to LTD4 was 24 +/- 3% of isoproterenol and the EC50 = 267 +/- 77 nM. The functional response was corroborated by the demonstration of specific and rapid [3H]LTD4 binding to GPLA membranes with low affinity (Kd = 212 +/- 80.2 nM), in a saturable (Bmax = 20 +/- 1.1 pmol/mg protein) manner. In tissues pretreated with acivicin, which inhibits conversion of LTC4 to LTD4, the response to LTC4, but not LTD4, was abolished. Selectivity towards LTD4 was demonstrated by the inability of propranolol, prazosin, atropine, pyrilamine, capsaicin or indomethacin (all tested at 1 microM) to alter the functional response to LTD4. Similarly, none of the tested compounds (100 microMs) was inhibitory in the binding assay. Structurally diverse LTD4 antagonists SKF102922 (pKb = 6.42) and ICI 198.615 (pKb = 8.74) were able to inhibit the functional response as well as [3H]LTD4 binding to GPLA membranes. The calcium channel antagonist, verapamil, inhibited the functional response but did not alter [3H]LTD4 binding. These data support the existence of specific LTD4 receptors in GPLA which evoke a modest, rapidly desensitized, increase in the force of myocardial contraction.\r"

For dependence studies, rats were trained to respond for food under a fixed-ratio 30 schedule during half-hour response periods every 6 hr. After training, implantation of jugular catheters, and restabilization of behavior, the rats were infused with PCP.HCl at 3.2, 5.6, 10.0 or 17.8 mg/kg/day (n = 5 or 6 per dose). The two higher doses initially decreased response rates, but tolerance developed within 4 to 5 days. When PCP infusions were terminated, dose-dependent decreases in session response rate occurred in the three highest dose groups (P less than .05). Mild, overt signs of abstinence were observed only in the highest dose group. Response rates returned to base line within 2 to 3 days after stopping PCP infusions. PCP serum concentrations in rats infused with 10 mg of PCP.HCl/kg/day for 10 days were stable from hour 24 to day 10 (mean steady-state concentration (+/- S.D.) = 97 (+/- 20) ng of PCP/ml; n = 4). The average terminal elimination half-life after stopping infusions on day 10 was 4.6 hr. Comparison of the average response rates with the average serum concentrations showed that during the first 24 hr of infusions, the rate of responding for food decreased as PCP concentrations increased; however, once the animals became tolerant to PCP there was no relationship. In contrast, during the first 24 hr after stopping infusions, response rates decreased as serum concentrations decreased.\r"

  ".W": "These experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that the antihypertensive action of the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats is associated with an inhibition of norepinephrine release from peripheral sympathetic neurons. Radiotracer techniques were used to measure norepinephrine clearance and spillover rate into plasma. A single 30 mg/kg (s.c.) dose of captopril elevated norepinephrine spillover rate by 20 to 25 and 45 to 60% at 0.5- and 2-hr postinjection, respectively. At 2-hr postinjection, captopril (10 and 30 mg/kg s.c.) produced a dose-related fall in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and dose-related increase in norepinephrine spillover rate. The 30-mg/kg dose was more effective in decreasing MAP when given s.c. as compared to i.v. dosing. When equivasodepressor doses of captopril, hydralazine and prazosin were compared at 2-hr postinjection, the increases in norepinephrine spillover rate produced by captopril (44%) and hydralazine (68%) were not different. However, prazosin elevated norepinephrine spillover rate by 137%. Norepinephrine clearance was not altered by captopril. When MAP was lowered to the same extent (-17 to -23%) by 5 days of continuous treatment with captopril, enalaprilat and minoxidil, the increases in norepinephrine spillover rate (50-65%) were not different in the three treatment groups. In conclusion, these data do not support the hypothesis that captopril lowers blood pressure by inhibiting the neuronal release of norepinephrine.\r"

High levels (rapid acetylator phenotype) of arylamine carcinogen N-acetyltransferase activity were observed in kidney, colon, prostate and urinary bladder cytosols derived from Fischer (F-344) inbred rats, the strain most commonly used for tumor bioassay studies and the strain most particularly used in arylamine-induced colon and prostate cancer studies. Significantly lower (slow acetylator phenotype) levels of arylamine carcinogen N-acetyltransferase activity were observed in corresponding tissue cytosols derived from Wistar-Kyoto inbred rats. Intermediate levels of arylamine carcinogen N-acetyltransferase activity significantly different from both the parental strains were observed in F1 hybrids of the parental strains, consistent with codominant expression of two alleles at a single gene locus. The arylamine substrates exhibiting the acetylator phenotype-dependent N-acetyltransferase activities included p-aminobenzoic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid, p-phenetidine, p-aminophenol, 2-aminofluorene, 3,2'-dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl, beta-naphthylamine and 4-aminobiphenyl, but not procainamide. Highest levels of arylamine carcinogen N-acetyltransferase were expressed consistently in colon cytosol, but expression of the N-acetylation polymorphism toward arylamine carcinogens was observed in each (kidney, colon, prostate and urinary bladder) of the tumor target organs. The expression of the N-acetylation polymorphism in tumor target organs suggests that the inbred rat model will be useful in assessing the role of acetylator phenotype in arylamine-induced cancers of the colon and prostate.\r"

Surprisingly, a very different selectivity pattern for the endogenous opioid peptide was found when the affinity of beta-endorphin for functional presynaptic opioid receptors was examined. Thus, beta-endorphin strongly inhibited the electrically evoked release of [3H]NE from rat neocortical slices with an IC50 value of about 0.5 nM, whereas [14C] acetylcholine release from neostriatal slices was inhibited with an IC50 value of about 100 nM. On the other hand, the electrically evoked release of [3H]dopamine from striatal slices was not affected by beta-endorphin. The inhibitory effects of DAMGO and beta-endorphin on [3H]NE release from neocortical slices were equally well antagonized by naloxone. Moreover, 10 nM of the highly selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen- Thr-NH2 antagonized competitively the inhibitory effect of beta-endorphin on [3H]NE release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the 52 degrees C hot plate test, NPY produced a dose-dependent elevation in the nociceptive threshold with a median effective dose of 1.1 nmol.

  ".U": "91303398\r", 
  ".W": "The ventral pallidum/substantia innominata (VP/SI) is an infracommissural extension of the dorsal globus pallidus (GP). Functional studies suggest that the VP/SI is indirectly influenced by dopamine (DA) via inputs from dopaminoceptive regions. However, recent anatomical evidence indicates a direct dopaminergic projection to the VP/SI, but the physiologic and pharmacologic consequences of this input have not been evaluated. Thus, the present study was designed to electrophysiologically characterize VP/SI neuronal responses to i.v. administered apomorphine (APO) and microiontophoretically applied DA. Because of similarities in circuitry and morphology, VP/SI responses were compared to those obtained from the GP. Single neurons recorded in vivo from rat VP/SI and GP exhibited similar electrophysiologic characteristics. The majority of the 50 neurons tested with APO demonstrated a dose-related increase in firing rate, with equivalent maximum responses and equivalent doses that produced half-maximal responding (ED50) for the two brain areas. APO generally was antagonized by haloperidol, indicating that the agonist was acting at dopaminergic receptors to produce the observed rate changes. From 212 neurons tested, it was determined that microiontophoretically applied DA altered neuronal firing throughout both regions. However, more DA-sensitive neurons were encountered in the GP than the VP/SI (75% vs. 42%, respectively). DA-induced rate increases and decreases were observed, with rate suppression occurring most frequently. The maximum response and the current that produced half-maximal responding were comparable for the two regions for both response directions. Systemic administration of antagonists revealed that pallidal responses to dopamine likely involve both the D1 and D2 receptor subtypes. These studies 1) demonstrate that the VP/SI is a functionally important dopaminoceptive brain region, and (2) confirm previous work regarding dopaminergic regulation of the GP. The similarities in pharmacologic profiles of responses by GP and VP/SI neurons to dopaminergic agents likely reflect comparable circuitries for the two regions. The differential responding to systemically administered DA agonists and locally applied DA implies that a combination of direct and indirect influences ultimately determines the impact that an activated dopaminergic system has on pallidal brain regions.\r"

  ".W": "alpha 1-Adrenoceptors are expressed in high density in the rat kidney. Recent studies have shown that alpha 1-adrenoceptors are heterogeneous and can be subtyped based on their affinity for the antagonists WB 4101 (alpha 1A greater than alpha 1B) and chloroethylclonidine (alpha 1B-selective). We therefore investigated the distribution of alpha 1-adrenoceptor subtypes using [3H]prazosin binding in membranes prepared from cortex, the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM), the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) and inner medulla dissected from rat kidney. [3H]Prazosin binding was detectable in each region with the following maximum binding site values for [3H]prazosin (femtomoles per milligram of protein): cortex, 186 +/- 20; OSOM, 76 +/- 14; ISOM, 34 +/- 2; and inner medulla, 8 +/- 2. Pretreatment of membranes with chloroethylclonidine (10 microM for 10 min) reduced maximum binding sites to 41 +/- 4% (75 +/- 9 fmol/mg) of control in cortex, 41 +/- 9% of control in OSOM (29 +/- 8 fmol/mg) and 15 +/- 3% of control in ISOM (5 +/- 1 fmol/mg). In competition studies, WB 4101 labeled both high and low affinity sites in cortex (respective pKi values = 10.01 +/- 0.3 and 8.23 +/- 0.1) and OSOM (pKi values = 9.6 + 0.3 and 8.3 +/- 0.5), but only low affinity sites in ISOM (pKi = 8.41 +/- 0.1). The relative prevalence of high:low affinity sites revealed by WB 4101 was 53:47 for cortex, 52:48 for OSOM and virtually all low affinity for ISOM. Prior treatment with chloroethylclonidine greatly reduced the low affinity component of the WB 4101 competition curve in cortex and OSOM. We conclude that: 1) the density of alpha 1-adrenoceptors is highest in the cortex and decreases from cortex to papilla and 2) the alpha 1A and alpha 1B subtypes are approximately equally distributed in the cortex and OSOM, but the alpha 1B subtype predominates in ISOM.\r"

Anesthetized rats were instrumented with electromagnetic or pulsed-Doppler flow probes to measure cardiac output or regional blood flow, respectively, and catheters to record MAP, left ventricular pressure and administer drugs. Zaprinast (0.33-2.0 mg.min-1.kg-1) produced dose-dependent decreases in MAP (maximum = -39 +/- 6 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance (maximum = -45 +/- 5%) when infused i.v. The greatest reductions in regional vascular resistance were observed in the mesenteric bed, with smaller decreases in the hindquarters and renal beds. Cardiac output increased (maximum = 22 +/- 7%) during the infusion of zaprinast; however, heart rate was only minimally affected. These increases in cardiac output were still evident in animals pretreated with beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptor antagonists. At the lowest dose, zaprinast tended to increase maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure, whereas, at higher doses maximal first derivative of left ventricular pressure was depressed or unchanged. Additional studies were performed to examine the effect of the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor on the pressor and vasoconstrictor activity of phenylephrine and angiotensin II. The increases in MAP and total peripheral resistance produced by these agents were attenuated markedly during continuous infusion of zaprinast (1 mg.min-1.kg-1). These data suggest that zaprinast lowers MAP by decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and by antagonizing the actions of endogenous neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems.\r"

We have studied BMAA pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability and blood-brain barrier permeability in the rat in an attempt to better define the possible role for BMAA in this disease. To evaluate its kinetics and uptake, BMAA (25-400 mg/kg) was administered to rats, either acutely or chronically, and then plasma and brain concentrations were determined at various times thereafter by combined gas chromatography mass spectrometry. After single dose i.v. injection, BMAA was cleared from plasma in a rapid distribution phase (Vd approximately 16 liters/kg) followed by a slower elimination phase (t1/2 approximately 1 day). Brain uptake was limited by a low blood-brain barrier permeability-surface area product of 2 to 5 x 10(-5) ml/sed/g. Brain BMAA levels peaked within 8 hr after injection, and then declined with a t1/2 similar to that of plasma. After two weeks of continuous infusion (100 mg/kg/day), steady-state brain concentrations equalled 10 to 30 micrograms/g, and only moderately exceeded those in plasma. The results suggest that BMAA may reach potentially toxic levels in brain (i.e., greater than 250 microM) after large doses (greater than 100 mg/kg). However, such doses are orders of magnitude greater than those available from dietary or medicinal use of cycads.\r"

  ".W": "Isolated human gastroepiploic vein tributaries responded to dopamine only with contractions, whereas the gastroepiploic artery branches in the same region of the omentum responded with relaxations. Treatment with phentolamine converted the vein contraction to a relaxation, which was not influenced by propranolol but was abolished by droperidol. The relaxation was converted to a contraction by SCH23390 but unaffected by domperidone. Endothelium denudation abolished the relaxation caused by substance P but did not significantly alter the dopamine-induced relaxation. Dopamine increased the cyclic AMP content in the human veins. Monkey mesenteric, renal and portal veins and vena cava contracted in response to dopamine. Treatment with phentolamine converted the contraction to a slight relaxation in the mesenteric and renal veins; however, even in the presence of high concentrations of the alpha adrenoceptor antagonist, no relaxation was induced in the portal vein and vena cava partially contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha. It is concluded that gastroepiploic veins and arteries in the human omentum respond quite differently to dopamine; the alpha adrenoceptor-mediated contraction predominates over the relaxation mediated via dopamine D1 receptor subtype in the veins, and vice versa in the arteries. Dopamine relaxes the human vein, possibly as a result of increased production of intracellular cyclic AMP by stimulation of D1 receptors. The predominant action of dopamine on alpha adrenoceptors may contribute to increasing venous return and cardiac output.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment with benzodiazepine agonists is associated with the development of behavioral tolerance and receptor downregulation, whereas antagonist administration has been reported to lead to increased activity and receptor upregulation. To determine the effects of chronic inverse agonist administration, mice were treated with FG-7142 (20 mg/kg/day) by implanted s.c. osmotic pumps for 1 to 14 days. No seizures were observed in FG-7142-exposed animals. Open-field activity was unchanged as compared to controls at days 1 and 2, but was elevated significantly at days 4 and 7. Activity was reduced below control values at day 14. Benzodiazepine receptor binding determined in vivo was unchanged for days 1, 4 and 7 within the hippocampus but was elevated at day 14. Binding remained unchanged in the cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and pons-medulla for the duration of drug exposure. Cortical benzodiazepine binding assessed in vitro was unchanged at days 1 and 2 but increased at days 4, 7 and 14 vs. vehicle treated controls. Binding at the gamma-aminobutyric acid site was increased at day 7 whereas binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphoro-thionate was increased at days 7 and 14 of FG-7142 exposure. Maximal muscimol-slimulated [36Cl-] uptake was elevated at days 4, 7 and 14 compared to day 1 of exposure. These results demonstrate that chronic continuous exposure to FG-7142 is associated with an absence of kindled seizures and with behavioral and neurochemical changes indicative of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor upregulation.\r"

  ".W": "Minoxidil sulfate is an antihypertensive agent belonging to the new class of vasodilators, the \"K+ channel openers.\" The present study was undertaken to characterize the effects of minoxidil sulfate on ionic and secretory events in rat pancreatic islets. The drug unexpectedly provoked a concentration-dependent decrease in 86Rb outflow. This inhibitory effect was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by glucose and tolbutamide. Minoxidil sulfate did not affect 45Ca outflow from islets perfused in the presence of extracellular Ca++ and absence or presence of glucose. However, in islets exposed to a medium deprived of extracellular Ca++, the drug provoked a rise in 45Ca outflow. Whether in the absence or presence of extracellular Ca++, minoxidil sulfate increased the cytosolic free Ca++ concentration of islet cells. Lastly, minoxidil sulfate increased the release of insulin from glucose-stimulated pancreatic islets. These results suggest that minoxidil sulfate reduces the activity of the ATP-sensitive K+ channels and promotes an intracellular translocation of Ca++. The latter change might account for the effect of the drug on the insulin-releasing process. However, the secretory response to minoxidil sulfate could also be mediated, at least in part, by a modest Ca++ entry.\r"

  ".W": "A vasoconstrictor-induced prostacyclin (PGI2) production in a perfused rat heart was found, suggesting a mitigating role of PGI2 on coronary vasoconstriction. Treatment of the heart with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (aspirin or indomethacin) decreased PGI2 production by more than 90% and paradoxically reduced the vasoconstriction response. The attenuating effect of cyclooxygenase blockade suggested that endogenous prostanoids contribute to serotonin-, vasopressin- or U46619-induced vasoconstriction. Two prostaglandin (PG) H2/thromboxane A2 (TXA2) receptor antagonists, i.e., 13-azaprostanoic acid (13-APA) and SQ 29,548 were used to investigate putative endogenous vasoconstrictor prostanoids on the exogenously induced vasoconstriction. Retrogradely perfused (5-6 ml/min) rat hearts were rendered guiescent, yet responsive to stimuli, by local injection of lidocaine to the atrioventricular node. Changes in coronary vascular resistance (i.e., perfusion pressure at constant flow) were monitored and the cardiac effluent was collected for analysis of 6-keto PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2) as well as PGF2 alpha by radioimmunoassay. Three vasoconstrictors, i.e., serotonin, vasopressin and the TXA2/PGH2 analog U46619, as well as authentic PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha were infused. PGD2, PGE2 and PGF2 alpha exerted a dose-related coronary vasoconstriction, as did U46619, serotonin and vasopressin. Treatment with 13-APA (100 microM) or SQ 29,548 (100 nM) almost abolished U46619-induced vasoconstriction. The addition of PGH2/TXA2 receptor antagonists also significantly reduced the pressor effect of exogenously administered PGs, serotonin and vasopressin, with the exception that SQ 29,548 did not significantly antagonize PGE2-induced vasoconstriction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In our present work, we studied the effect of the potent and selective delta antagonist, naltrindole (NTI), and its nonequilibrium analog, naltrindole 5'-isothiocyanate (5'-NTII), on the development of morphine tolerance and dependence in mice. In the acute model, mice injected with 100 mg/kg of morphine sulfate s.c. displayed acute tolerance 4 hr later as evidenced by a greater than 3-fold increase of the ED50 of morphine sulfate when compared to that of control mice. The acute tolerance was accompanied by the development of acute physical dependence as seen by the dramatic decrease in the amount of naloxone required to precipitate withdrawal jumping. Likewise, in the chronic model s.c. implantation of morphine pellets (75 mg free base) for 3 days produced tolerance and physical dependence. The ED50 of morphine sulfate in this case was increased by about 19-fold and the amount of naloxone needed to precipitate withdrawal jumping was 40 times lower than that required for acutely dependent mice. The development of acute tolerance and dependence was suppressed markedly in mice pretreated with NTI before induction of tolerance and dependence with 100 mg/kg of morphine sulfate. Multiple administration of either NTI or 5'-NTII before and during implantation with morphine base pellets also inhibited substantially the development of morphine tolerance and dependence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Muscarinic receptors characterized by inhibition of [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate binding in membranes of bovine pial arteries were of the M2 subtype. In contrast pharmacological analysis of [3H]-quinuclidinylbenzilate binding in bovine intracerebral microvessels suggests the presence of an M4 subtype. Receptors mediating endothelium-dependent vasodilation in rabbit pial arteries were of the M3 subtype, whereas muscarinic receptors stimulating endothelium-independent phosphoinositide hydrolysis in bovine pial arteries were of the M1 subtype. These findings suggest that characteristics of muscarinic receptors in cerebral blood vessels vary depending on the type of vessel, cellular location and function mediated.\r"

From the 70th min onwards the strips were exposed to 10 microM ouabain, some of them being subject to electrical stimulation from the 140th min onwards. Other strips were exposed to either 1, 10 or 100 microM ouabain from the 70th min onwards. The spontaneous efflux of [3H]NE had a long half-time (156 min), and over 90% of the [3H]NE accumulated did not participate in efflux (\"bound fraction\"). Ouabain, 10 microM, induced a pronounced increase of the rate of efflux of [3H]NE, which was delayed in its onset and reached a maximum at t = 135 min of superfusion. Increasing the concentration of ouabain decreased both the delay to the beginning of the overflow and the time to maximum efflux and increased the maximum rate of efflux. In Ca(++)-free medium (during the superfusion period), the maximum rate of efflux was lower than in Ca(++)-containing medium, but was attained earlier. The bound fraction amounted to 22% when the efflux was induced by 10 microM ouabain in Ca(++)-containing medium, a value unnaffected by electrical stimulation but reduced markedly by omitting calcium. The results support the view that the efflux of [3H]NE induced by ouabain is delayed and that it is both carrier-mediated and due to exocytosis.\r"

With respect to the fate of mobilized fatty acids, the same treatment of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) caused a 32% inhibition (P less than .008) of the rate of hepatic oleate oxidation without significantly affecting the rate of fatty acid esterification. In contrast, hepatic ketogenic rate from oleate and octanoate was stimulated markedly by 85% (P less than .001) and 69% (P less than .001), respectively. These results support the concept that although the beta-oxidation pathway of the fatty acids must be operating normally, their complete oxidation to CO2 via the Tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is impaired. At the same time, TCDD seems to preferentially divert the acetyl CoA generated from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids to the ketogenic pathway. Surprisingly, TCDD treatment inhibited the hepatic ketogenic rate from glycerol by 21% (P less than .001) and its oxidation to CO2 by 31% (P less than .025) without affecting its esterification to triglycerides. These results imply that the other possible major site which is sensitive to TCDD inhibition may be the generation of acetyl CoA from glycerol via the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.\r"

Amantadine (10 microM, 30 sec) was actively accumulated by cortical slices (slice/medium ratio = 0.4 +/- 0.3 [3.3 +/- 0.3 at 4 min], mean +/- S.E.M.), isolated proximal tubules (tubule/medium ratio = 35 +/- 1) and distal tubules (tubule/medium ratio = 19 +/- 2). In cortical slices, low cimetidine concentrations facilitated amantadine accumulation, whereas higher concentrations produced inhibition. Uptake in proximal tubules was enhanced by cimetidine and reached a maximum at approximately 100 microM. Cimetidine (20 microM) decreased the apparent Km (88 +/- 5 to 55 +/- 3 microM, P less than .005) without altering Vmax (6.8 +/- 0.5 to 5.8 +/- 0.6 nmol/mg/min). Conversely, cimetidine did not enhance uptake in distal tubules but elicited competitive inhibition at concentrations greater than 1 mM. Although this may partially delineate the differences observed between the cortical slice and proximal tubule data, such a discrepancy may also implicate additional sites of interaction in other segments of the cortical nephron and/or cimetidine inhibition of the relatively more significant luminal amantadine efflux in the proximal tubules. Ranitidine did not enhance amantadine accumulation but produced inhibition at high concentrations. In proximal and distal tubule preparations, ranitidine (10 mM) increased Km from 86 +/- 7 to 121 +/- 8 and 95 +/- 5 to 160 +/- 10 microM, respectively (P less than .05), whereas Vmax was not changed (8.9 +/- 0.7 to 7.9 +/- 0.8 and 4.3 +/- 0.1 to 3.8 +/- 0.2 nmol/mg/min, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the presence of famotidine (10(-6) M) and thioperamide (10(-5) M), histamine, N alpha-methylhistamine (NMH) and (R)-alpha-methylhistamine (alpha-MH) exerted a concentration-dependent contractile effect through activation of H1 receptors; the ratio of potency was histamine = NMH greater than alpha-MH (this last compound was approximately 500 times less potent). In the presence of pyrilamine (10(-6) M) and thioperamide (10(-5) M), histamine, dimaprit and impromidine caused a slight contractile effect, showing a high degree of tachyphylaxis; this effect was abolished by tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) and by famotidine (10(-6) M). alpha-MH was ineffective up to 10(-4) M. The H2 receptor agonists dimaprit (10(-4) to 10(-3) M) and impromidine (10(-6) to 10(-5) M) caused a relaxant effect on the contraction elicited by acetylcholine (ACh), BaCl2 and electrical stimulation. This effect, which was unaffected by famotidine, was not mimicked by alpha-MH and not reversed by thioperamide (10(-5) M).

A 30-sec rest period interrupting the conditioning stimulation at rates greater than 0.5 Hz caused positive inotropy of the first postrest (B1) contraction (rest potentiation). The potentiated B1 contraction was much more resistant to the negative inotropic effect of nifedipine (1 and 3 microM) than the steady-state contraction. The nifedipine-resistant B1 contraction was abolished by ryanodine (30 nM) or caffeine (5 mM). Single treatment of the muscle with KT-362 much greater than or equal to 10 microM resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the steady state beat as well as in B1 contraction. In preparations pretreated with 1 microM nifedipine, KT-362 had greater inhibitory action against B1 contraction (IC50 = 7.8 microM). KT-362 (3 and 10 microM) reduced the late plateau amplitude of transmembrane action potential associated with the B1 contraction. Tetrodotoxin (1 and 3 microM) and quinidine (3 and 10 microM) caused a rightward shift of the force-frequency relationship for the B1 contraction but, unlike KT-362, they caused no or minimal reduction of the maximal B1 values. In the presence of 1 microM nifedipine, B1 contraction showed biphasic response to a prolongation of the preceding rest period, an initial rapid increase up to 30 sec was followed by a gradual decrease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The specific P2x-purinoceptor photoaffinity label antagonist, arylazido aminopropionyl ATP (ANAPP3), inhibits the first contractile phase. The second phase, which is increased for adenosine 5'-O-(3-thio-triphosphate)(ATP gamma S) and attenuated for 5'-anhydride-substituted ATP analogs, has been hypothesized to be initiated by phosphate chain cleavage, and is inhibited irreversibly by periodate-oxidized ATP (P-ATP), an affinity label. We examined whether phosphorylation occurs during contraction to ATP gamma S and ATP, and whether the irreversible inhibition of the second phase of contraction by P-ATP results from its covalent incorporation. After incubation of intact tissues with [35S]ATP gamma S (3 mM), homogenization, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, 35SPO2(3-) (35S) was incorporated predominantly into a single, 19 to 21 kD protein. The incorporation was transient and paralleled the time course of the transient contraction to ATP gamma S (peak by 5 to 10 sec, then rapid decline during 60 sec). Treatment with P-ATP (10 mM; 5 min) or ANAPP3 (10(-4) M) inhibited 35S incorporation at 60 sec. 32PO4(3-) (32P) from [gamma-32P] ATP (3 mM) also was incorporated rapidly into the protein; removal of 32P, however, was faster than removal of 35S. [3H]P-ATP was incorporated into several proteins, but not into the 19 to 21 kD protein nor the ones labeled by photolyzed ANAPP3. Incorporation of 35S from [35S]ATP gamma S, and [3H]P-ATP, were not affected by incubation in the presence of histamine or norepinephrine (10(-4)-10(-3) M), whereas ATP (10(-2) M) reduced incorporation of [3H]P-ATP (10(-5)-10(-2) M). The results support the hypothesis that the second phase of contraction to ATP involves a transductive phosphoryl transfer involving an ecto-kinase, which is inhibited by P-ATP.\r"

In addition, because many of the signs and symptoms observed in animals and humans after abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepines resemble the stress response, we examined the effect of alprazolam withdrawal on CRF neurons and HPA axis activity. Alprazolam decreases CRF concentrations in the locus coeruleus between 0.5 and 3.0 h following acute injection. The half-life of alprazolam in rats is less than 1 h in both plasma and brain. Similarly, chronic (14 days) alprazolam administration also results in decreased CRF concentrations in the locus coeruleus. CRF concentrations return to control values 24 h after abrupt withdrawal. Moreover, abrupt alprazolam withdrawal results in increased plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone and corticosterone concentrations and decreased anterior pituitary CRF receptor concentrations 24 h after drug discontinuation. These indices return to control values by 48 h postwithdrawal. These results support the hypothesis that both acute and chronic alprazolam administration alters CRF-containing neurons innervating the locus coeruleus. Additionally, abrupt alprazolam withdrawal profoundly activates the HPA axis.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that weakly acidic drugs are reabsorbed from the urinary bladder was tested using adult female Fischer rats. Bladder reabsorption would have direct implications for pharmacokinetic data analysis of compounds with significant renal excretion. Sodium salicylate (SA) undergoes extensive renal excretion in the rat, and was selected as the model compound. Methodology was developed to administer an intravesical dose to a rat via a transurethral catheter. The barrier function and the integrity of the bladder urothelium were examined by light and electron microscopy, and by monitoring leakage of [14C] inulin (MW 5000) and fluorescein (MW 376). Using these methodologies, we found that urothelial integrity was maintained in about 80% of the animals. Animals that showed tissue damage were excluded from the study. In the pharmacokinetic experiments, one group of animals received an i.v. dose of SA (1.5 or 3 mg/kg), the second group received an intravesical dose of 30 mg/kg (approximately 0.3 ml) and the third group received concomitantly an i.v. tracer dose of [14C] SA and an intravesical dose of unlabeled SA (30 mg/kg). The intravesical dose was removed after 90 min. The intravesical administration of SA produced maximal blood concentrations of 10.8 +/- 5.6 micrograms/ml (mean +/- S.D., n = 10) at 90 to 100 min. The fraction of the intravesical dose recovered after 90 min was between 45 and 75%, which indicates an upper limit of 25 to 55% loss by processes including absorption. The bioavailability of the intravesical dose, calculated from the blood data and the clearance of the i.v. doses, was between 4 and 23% and averaged about 13%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bombesin is a potent bronchoconstrictor in guinea pigs in vivo, but the mechanisms of its effect are not certain. In vivo increases in tracheal pressure induced by bombesin were measured as an index of airway caliber. Bombesin (0.3-10 micrograms/kg) produced a dose-related bronchoconstrictor response in vivo which was not inhibited by indomethacin (5 mg/kg), BW A4C (50 mg/kg, a lipoxygenase inhibitor), WEB 2086 (10 micrograms/kg, a platelet-activating factor antagonist) or mepyramine (10 mg/kg, a histamine H1-receptor antagonist). Capsaicin pretreatment (50 mg/kg), which depletes neuropeptides from sensory nerve endings, similarly failed to inhibit the action of bombesin. Propranolol (1 mg/kg) produced a small shift to the left and atropine (1 mg/kg) and the serotonin antagonist, methysergide (1 mg/kg), produced a small shift to the right in the bombesin dose-response curve. The bombesin receptor antagonist, BIM 26159 (50 micrograms/kg), transiently inhibited bombesin-induced bronchoconstriction. Isoproterenol (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) reversed the increase in tracheal pressure induced by bombesin, suggesting that contraction of airway smooth muscle was involved. Bombesin (10(-10)-3 x 10(-5) M) failed to produce contraction in trachea or main bronchi either denuded of epithelium or in tissues pretreated with phosphoramidon, captopril or indomethacin (all 10(-5) M) and was inactive in peripheral lung strip preparations. Thus, bombesin is a potent constrictor of guinea pig airways in vivo. The inability of bombesin to contract airway smooth muscle in vitro suggests that the bronchoconstrictor action of bombesin is largely due to the release of an unidentified spasmogenic substance.\r"

ETs and sarafotoxin S6b (0.1-100 nM) induced potent contractile responses in guinea pig trachea with EC50 values ranging from 1.57 to 12.97 nM. Epithelium removal increased the potencies of ET-1, ET-2 and S6b, but not that of ET-3, and maximal responses to ET-1 and ET-2 were also increased. Effects of epithelium removal were partially mimicked by phosphoramidon (10 microM), an enkephalinase inhibitor, suggesting that enkephalinase (EC.3.4.24.11.) is able to degrade ET-1 and ET-2. ET-3-induced contractions were not affected by phosphoramidon. Autoradiographic studies suggested the presence of at least two specific binding sites for [125]ET-1 in guinea pig airway smooth muscle. The correlation between Kd and EC50 values suggests that the binding sites identified in the airway smooth muscle represent functional receptors for ETs. ET(16-21) and ET(16-21)-NH2 were less potent agonists than the ETs in guinea pig trachea and 10 microM ET(16-21) was unable to inhibit [125I]ET-1 binding in guinea pig airway smooth muscle. Therefore, these results suggest that the C-terminal hexapeptide of ET-1 cannot be used to classify ET receptors in guinea pig trachea.\r"

Relaxation to acetylcholine, A23187 and nitroprusside was examined in aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine (3 x 10(-6) M). Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated in the nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days, in comparison to the control animals. In aortic rings taken from control and nephrotic rats on the 40th day, removal of the endothelium or treatment with methylene blue (10(-5) M) completely abolished the relaxation induced by acetylcholine (10(-5) M). In addition, acetylcholine (10(-5) M) induced a transient increase in the aortic cyclic GMP and this increase was completely abolished by removal of the endothelium. In the preparations of nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days, the cyclic GMP levels stimulated by acetylcholine (10(-5) M) were decreased to about 50% in comparison to their respective control. A23187 also evoked diminished relaxation in nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days. However, on the 40th day after the treatment, the effects of nitroprusside in relaxing the aorta and in elevating the cyclic GMP level in the aorta were not altered by nephrosis. In addition, the nitroprusside-induced relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation were not affected by removal of the endothelium. These results indicate that endothelium-dependent relaxation is attenuated with the development of nephrosis.\r"

By measuring inulin clearance, lithium clearance and urinary excretion rates of sodium and water, the changes in proximal and distal tubular sodium handling were dissociated. In furosemide-infused rats given doxazosin (n = 11) or volume replacement (n = 9), the fractional lithium excretion increased from 30% (control) to a steady-state value of 51% (last hour of furosemide infusion), whereas in rats infused with furosemide only (n = 9), the fractional lithium excretion increased transiently to a peak value of 52% and then declined to a steady-state value of 39%. Doxazosin attenuated the acute natriuretic response to furosemide by 54%, mainly due to increased sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron segment. This effect was associated with a significant lower mean arterial pressure compared with rats given furosemide only. The results are compatible with a contributory role of proximal tubular alpha-1 adrenoceptors in mediating compensatory Na reabsorption during furosemide-induced volume contraction.\r"

In the rabbit aorta, EXP3892 exhibited selective and insurmountable AII antagonism. DuP 753 at 10(-6) M, added before or after EXP3892, reversed partially the depressed AII maximal response caused by 10(-9) M EXP3892. Repeated washing of the rabbit aorta created with DuP 753 at 10(-6) M or EXP3892 at 10(-9) M did not restore completely the sensitivity to AII for at least 2 hr. In the pithed rat, EXP3892 showed selective and insurmountable AII antagonism. DuP 753 at 0.1 to 3 mg/kg i.v., given before or after EXP3892, reversed the reduced AII-maximal response induced by EXP3892 at 0.1 mg/kg i.v. We propose that DuP 753 by binding to the AII receptor induces conformational changes resulting in a reduction of the affinity of the receptor for coupling factors/transducer proteins, which causes surmountable antagonism. EXP3892 would diminish the binding capacity for coupling factors accounting for insurmountable antagonism. As DuP 753 and EXP3892 compete for the same AII receptor, the reduced AII-maximal response by EXP3892 may be reversed by DuP 753.\r"

The F- contractions were not affected by endothelial denudation but were enhanced in the presence of A (0.1 or 1.0 mM) added to the bathing Krebs' solution. The contractile effect of F- also was not modified by bathing with Ca(++)-free + ethylene glycol bis(b-aminoethylether)-N,N-tetracetic acid Krebs' solution or nifedipine (10 microM), but was attenuated by inorganic (Cd++, Co++ and Ni++) Ca++ antagonists in normal and Ca(++)-free Krebs' media. Bis(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N-N-N'-N'-tetraacetic acid, ryanodine and intracellular Ca++ modulators, respectively, caused 36.1 +/- 6.1%, 16.4 +/- 6.8% and 52.3 +/- 7.3% inhibition of the contractile response to F- in a Ca(++)-free media while causing near complete inhibition of norepinephrine-induced contractions. F- contractions were also inhibited by the calmodulin antagonists W-7 and calmidazolium (IC50 = 23.0 +/- 7.0 and 45.0 +/- 10.0 microM, respectively). On the other hand, the protein kinase C antagonists staurosporine and H-7 potently (IC50 = 0.016 +/- 0.007 and 1.1 +/- 0.5 microM, respectively) inhibited the fluoride-induced contractions. Aortic rings from the rabbit were similarly potently antagonized by the protein kinase C inhibitors, however, K(+)-induced contractions were also equally sensitive to these agents in both rat and rabbit tissues. The putative phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin was significantly less effective (IC50 = 13.0 +/- 5.0, 0.44 +/- 0.09 and 0.89 +/- 0.40 mM) at inhibiting F- than norepinephrine and KCl contractile effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

They have yielded conflicting results. The pattern of homologous desensitization of phospholipase C activation and [Ca++i] increase induced by the PGH2/TxA2 agonist U46619 in rat aortic SMC was similar to that previously observed in human platelets: rapid desensitization of both responses followed by a delayed loss of binding sites from the cell membrane. Recently, the pattern of receptor inactivation by the antagonist ligand, GR 32191, has identified two subtypes in platelets. GR 32191 binds reversibly (GRr) to a site that mediates platelet shape change and an increase [Ca++i] and irreversibly (GRirr) to a site linked to phospholipase C activation and aggregation. In contrast to platelets, studies of ligand dissociation only identified GRr sites in rat aortic SMC and GR 32191 failed to inactivate PGH2/TxA2 receptors as detected by the PGH2/TxA2 receptor antagonist, [3H]SQ 29548. Inhibition of U46619-induced contraction of both rat aortic and human saphenous vein was competitive, consistent with the absence of GRirr sites in VSMC. Platelet activating factor, which heterologously desensitizes U46619-evoked phospholipase C activation in platelets, had no such effect in VSMC. The biochemical events attendant to PGH2/TxA2 receptor desensitization are similar in SMC and platelets. However, both the pattern of receptor inactivation by GR 32191 and of heterologous desensitization by PAF, suggest that VSMC lack the receptor subtype that transduces aggregation of platelets.\r"

[3H]prazosin bound rapidly and reversibly to a single class of high affinity binding sites in myometrial membrane preparations. Scatchard analysis gave similar values of equilibrium dissociation constants in both myometrial layers. In contrast, more alpha-1 adrenergic receptors were detected in the outer layer than in the inner layer. Antagonist inhibited [3H]prazosin binding with an order of potency of prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than idazoxan. Competition experiments have also revealed that a stable guanine nucleotide decreases the apparent affinity of norepinephrine for myometrial [3H]prazosin binding sites. The functional status of these alpha-1 adrenergic receptors was also assessed by measuring the norepinephrine-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates in myometrial tissue. Norepinephrine produced a concentration-dependent accumulation of inositol phosphates in both myometrial layers. However, norepinephrine-induced increases in inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate were only observed in the outer layer. These results indicate that alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in human myometrium at the end of pregnancy are linked to phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that this response occurs mainly in the outer layer.\r"

The effects of putative sigma receptor antagonists BMY 14802 and rimcazole on DTG-induced changes in body temperature also were evaluated. The acute s.c. administration of DTG (10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) produced hypothermia but no observable behavioral effects. Similarly, the acute i.c.v. administration of DTG (12.0-100.0 micrograms/rat) produced hypothermia, but ataxia occurred after this route of administration. The s.c. administration of BMY 14802 alone (25.0 mg/kg) decreased body temperature and enhanced the DTG-induced hypothermia, whereas the administration of rimcazole (25.0 mg/kg) neither altered body temperature nor affected the hypothermia produced by DTG. Neither BMY 14802 nor rimcazole produced any behavioral effects when administered alone. The inability of the putative sigma receptor antagonists BMY 14802 and rimcazole to antagonize DTG-induced hypothermia suggests that either these compounds at the dose used have little sigma receptor antagonist activity, or that the DTG-induced hypothermia is not due to specific interactions with sigma receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to elucidate the possible actions of yohimbine on cardiac function and metabolism in the hypoxic and subsequently reoxygenated myocardium. For this purpose, rabbit hearts were perfused for 20 min under hypoxic conditions, followed by 45 min reoxygenated perfusion, and their functional and metabolic alterations with and without yohimbine treatment were examined. Hypoxia induced cessation of cardiac contractile force, rise in resting tension and depletion of tissue high-energy phosphates, which were poorly recovered by subsequent reoxygenation. Hypoxia also induced release of creatine kinase and ATP metabolites from perfused hearts and increases in tissue calcium and sodium contents, which were further enhanced upon subsequent reoxygenation. When hypoxic hearts were treated with 3 to 30 microM yohimbine, several beneficial effects were observed in a concentration-dependent manner. This included enhancement of posthypoxic recovery of contractile function and suppression of the hypoxia- and reoxygenation-induced rise in resting tension. Hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced release of ATP metabolites was inhibited and restoration of myocardial high-energy phosphates enhanced. Inhibition of reoxygenation-induced rise in tissue calcium and sodium and creatine kinase release were also noted. The findings suggest that suppression of transmembrane flux of ions, substrates and enzymes during hypoxia/reoxygenation plays a role in the posthypoxic functional and metabolic recovery. Yohimbine (3-30 microM) significantly depressed the maximal stimulus frequency the left atria could follow. These results suggest a close relationship between depression in the maximal driving frequency of atria and enhancement of the posthypoxic contractile and metabolic recovery of perfused hearts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No plausible somatic etiology was apparent in the remaining 65 (53%) of the 122 referrals. Nongynecologic somatic pathology accounted for 34 (29%) and gynecologic pathology for 23 (19%) of the referrals, only 6 (5%) of whom ultimately required hysterectomy. Women with a somatic diagnosis were found to be significantly older than the remainder of the referral population. Long-term symptomatic improvement or resolution of pain was obtained in 43 (75%) of the 57 patients with somatic diagnoses. Coexistent psychopathology was found to correlate with a poorer long-term prognosis. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating and treating chronic pelvic pain in women and confirm that hysterectomy is indicated in this setting only rarely.\r"

  ".W": "The interrelation between uterine activity and pain from primary dysmenorrhea has been of interest for many years. Objective studies of uterine activity during non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy have supported the assertion that uterine activity causes pain and that reducing that activity leads to pain reduction. Unfortunately, those studies could not refute the counter-assertion that reductions in uterine activity come about because of reduced pain through central analgesia and not by direct pharmacologic action. In an effort to clarify this question, a small number of women were studied using intrauterine pressure recording and analysis to evaluate objective changes in uterine physiology during transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy for dysmenorrhea. The preliminary studies indicated that despite successful subjective therapy with TENS, intrauterine pressure parameters remained steady or showed signs of worsening. These findings indicate that TENS provides pure analgesia by an alteration of the body's ability to receive or perceive the pain signal rather than by a direct uterine effect. It appears that the reduction in uterine activity seen in objective drug studies represents direct drug action rather than a change from reduced pain through central analgesic effects.\r"

The smear provided endocervical cells from 97% of the patients, while the Papanicolaou smear provided them from 64%. The brush was unsatisfactory (no endocervical cells) in 3% of the patients. In nine patients (2%) no endocervical cells were found on either specimen. In six patients (1%) the brush smear was unsatisfactory, while endocervical cells were found on the Papanicolaou smear. The study design precluded an adequate assessment of the sensitivity for detecting abnormal cells with the addition of the brush. The addition of an endocervical brush smear to the routine Papanicolaou smear appears to provide better sampling of the endocervical canal than does the standard Papanicolaou smear alone, using a cotton-tipped applicator.\r"

Between 1979 and 1987, 140 women with emesis severe enough to require parenteral fluid and electrolyte replacement were admitted to the Medical University of South Carolina Hospital, Charleston, on 220 occasions. Thirty-nine of the 140 women were admitted on multiple occasions. A comparison of clinical characteristics of women with single and multiple admissions revealed no significant differences except that women admitted repeatedly for hyperemesis gravidarum were more likely to be nulliparous (P less than .05). Ptyalism (59% vs. 9%) and persistent vomiting for greater than 24 hours after admission (69% vs. 23%) were significantly more common among women who were admitted repeatedly (P less than .05). Despite published reports that hyperemesis gravidarum has no impact on ultimate perinatal outcome, this study indicated that women admitted repeatedly have a more severe nutritional disturbance, associated with significantly reduced maternal weight gain and neonatal birth weight. These risks argue for more aggressive antenatal treatment and increased fetal surveillance in pregnancies complicated by recurrent hyperemesis gravidarum.\r"

Considering all the cases evaluated, a total regression of symptoms occurred in 82 patients (59.4%), while a partial regression occurred in 37 (26.8%). Furthermore, there was a total regression of gross changes in 68 cases (49.3%) and a partial one in 43 (31.1%).

  ".W": "A new technique for characterizing somatic mutations in very small samples of cellularly heterogeneous human cancer tissue was developed and tested using mutations in the p53 gene in breast carcinomas as a model system. The technique combines touch preparation of specimens to obtain homogeneous clusters of carcinoma cells free of normal cells with a nested pair of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications of DNA to increase the amount of target gene sequence sufficiently to permit direct sequencing of the p53 gene. Touch preparations of fresh or previously frozen tissue from human adenocarcinomas derived from several organs were stained, and clusters of 10-50 malignant cells were transferred by pipette into microfuge tubes for PCR amplification. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene, which contain the major mutational hot spots associated with most human cancers, were sequenced by the following steps: 1) two rounds of PCR amplification using DNA Taq polymerase and two sets of oligonucleotide primers, the second set being nested within the segment amplified by the first set and having attached T7 and SP6 phage promoter sequences, 2) transcription of the amplified DNA sequences with T7 and SP6 RNA polymerases, and 3) dideoxy sequencing of single-stranded RNA transcripts with reverse transcriptase and with additional oligonucleotide primers to achieve specificity for this unique region of the genome. The utility of this approach is illustrated by our success in detecting and analyzing point mutations in cell clusters from four of 11 primary adenocarcinomas of the human breast.\r"

By the age of 25 years, most smokers have already become regular smokers. Among men, the proportion of each birth cohort who become regular smokers has declined at a rate of about 1.0% for each year of birth since 1945. There has been no identifiable decline in successive birth cohorts of women. For those born in the most recent birth cohorts, there was no sex difference in the proportion who became regular smokers. The proportion of smokers beginning to smoke during the secondary-school years (less than or equal to 18 years of age) has increased steadily, especially among people with a high-school education or less. However, in the latest birth cohort (1960-1962), over 18% of ever smokers with at least a high-school education did not start to smoke regularly until their young-adult years (19-24 years of age). If the effect of tobacco-education programs in the schools is to postpone the uptake of regular smoking, it is important to have tobacco policies in place in other areas of society that will maintain non-smoking behavior through the young-adult years. Accordingly, the banning of smoking in colleges, universities, and worksites, as well as in secondary schools, may significantly decrease the proportion of young people who eventually become regular smokers.\r"

The first group (n = 846) received postoperative radiotherapy, while the second group (n = 864) received radiotherapy plus tamoxifen at a dose of 30 mg given daily for 48 weeks. The median observation time was 7.9 years. In comparison with the number of new cancers in the general population, the number of new cancers in the three groups was elevated mostly due to a high number of cancers of the contralateral breast and of colorectal cancers in the high-risk groups. The cumulative risk of nonlymphatic leukemia was increased among patients who received postoperative radiotherapy (P = .04). Cancer incidence in the high-risk tamoxifen-treated group relative to that in the high-risk group not treated with tamoxifen was not significant (1.3). No protective effect of tamoxifen on the opposite breast was seen (rate ratio for breast cancer = 1.1), but a tendency to an elevated risk of endometrial cancer was observed (rate ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.6-32.4).

To determine the maximum tolerated dose of 5-FU with leucovorin for use in combination with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin, we conducted a phase I/II trial in 20 patients. The doses of leucovorin (200 mg/m2 on days 1-5), cyclophosphamide (500 mg/m2 on day 1), and doxorubicin (40 mg/m2 on day 1) were held constant, while the dose of 5-FU was escalated in cohorts of patients beginning at 150 mg/m2 on days 1-5. Cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. Significant mucositis, diarrhea, and myelosuppression were infrequently observed in patients receiving up to 250 mg/m2 5-FU on days 1-5. In contrast, at a dose of 300 mg/m2 on days 1-5, three of six patients had granulocyte count nadirs of less than 500/microL during the first cycle of therapy, and two of these three had platelet counts of less than 25,000/microL. In addition, two patients treated at this dose had significant mucosal toxic effects, and three had insufficient recovery to permit a second course by day 22. Among 14 patients with assessable breast cancer, there were one complete and nine partial responses (response rate 71%). Leucovorin modulation of 5-FU can be safely incorporated into combination chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin and provides a highly active regimen for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Further study will be required to determine whether the addition of leucovorin significantly enhances the activity of this regimen.\r"

  ".W": "The metastatic capacity of intravenously injected human FEMX-I melanoma cells in athymic nude mice and rats was compared. Young rats given 1 x 10(6) ascites tumor cells all died of lung tumors with a life span of 50 +/- 10 days (mean +/- SD). In contrast, in accordance with previous findings, only extrapulmonary metastases developed in mice. This host-dependent difference in metastasis pattern permitted studies on the role of factors that may influence the organ specificity of metastases. The tissue distribution of 125I-labeled FEMX-I cells did not differ in the two nude species during the first 12 hours after cell injection. The plating efficiency of FEMX-I cells in soft agar was increased by the addition of conditioned medium prepared from rat lungs, resulting also in a significant increase in colony size. In contrast, conditioned medium prepared from mouse lungs reduced the clonogenic capacity of the FEMX-I cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conditioned media prepared from rat and mouse liver, kidney, and spleen tissues either inhibited or had no effect on colony formation. The results suggest that the unexpected differential metastatic patterns observed in vivo may reflect differences in the presence of growth-modulating paracrine factors in the host lungs.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate a possible relationship between the exposure to tobacco smoke and the presence of ras point mutations, we examined lung adenocarcinoma samples from 27 smokers and from 27 nonsmokers. Activating point mutations in K-ras (also known as KRAS2) and N-ras (also known as NRAS) were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide hybridization to detect the mutated sequences. Mutations were more often found in adenocarcinomas obtained from smokers (eight of 27) than in adenocarcinomas obtained from nonsmokers (two of 27) (P = .044, Fisher's exact test). All mutations were present in K-ras codon 12. None of the other parameters examined differed significantly between the ras-positive and ras-negative groups. We conclude that exposure to carcinogenic agents in tobacco smoke is an important factor in the induction of point mutations in K-ras in human lung adenocarcinomas, but that K-ras mutations may also infrequently occur in tumors of non-smokers.\r"

  ".W": "Carcinoma of the cervix has several well-established epidemiologic risk factors, including multiple sexual partners and early age at first intercourse. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to have an etiologic role in the development of cervical neoplasia, but evidence linking HPV infection to known risk factors for cervical cancer has been inconsistent. The lack of expected correlations may be due to the inaccuracy of HPV assays previously used. A polymerase chain reaction DNA amplification method for the detection of HPV was used to investigate the determinants of genital HPV infection in a cross-sectional sample of 467 women attending a university health service. In contrast to studies using less accurate detection methods, the risk factors for HPV infection found here were consistent with those for cervical neoplasia. The risk of HPV infection was strongly and independently associated with increasing numbers of sexual partners in a lifetime, use of oral contraceptives, younger age, and black race. Age at first intercourse, smoking, and history of a prior sexually transmitted disease were correlated with, but not independently predictive of, HPV infection. These results demonstrate that the key risk factors for cervical carcinoma are strongly associated with genital HPV infection. This correlation suggests that HPV has an etiologic role in cervical neoplasia and reaffirms the sexual route of HPV transmission.\r"

Following institution of a protocol to evaluate the cervical spine in all blunt trauma patients, 179 patients underwent CT scanning of their cervical spine. This was performed for patients whose x-ray findings were positive, for patients with plain x-ray films suggestive of a pathologic condition, for patients with plain x-ray films that did not reveal all of the cervical vertebrae, and for patients who had persistent pain or neurologic deficits despite normal plain x-ray films. Of 123 patients not able to have their cervical spine cleared by normal roentgenograms, 93% were cleared within 24 hours of admission based on CT scans. There were no missed injuries in this setting. A false-positive rate of 28% and a false-negative rate of 1.5% were found for plain roentgenograms. Computed tomographic scans detected 98% of the injuries in our study and when combined with a three-view plain x-ray series of the cervical spine, 100% of cervical spine injuries were detected. Computed tomographic scanning as an adjunct to plain x-ray films of the cervical spine is a highly accurate and expedient modality to clear the cervical spine of blunt trauma patients.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of resuscitative emergency room thoracotomy (ERT), particularly in blunt injury, has been questioned. Wide application of the procedure may not be cost effective. The risk of exposure and lethal infection to medical personnel during ERT is considerable. For the past decade, the policy at this institution has been to perform ERT on all moribund patients sustaining penetrating torso injury and all patients sustaining blunt injury with any evidence of cardiac electrical activity. To evaluate whether such a liberal policy is currently justified, the charts of all patients undergoing ERT over a 4-year period were reviewed. One hundred twelve patients underwent ERT; 24 (21%) sustained penetrating injury, 88 (79%) blunt injury. The overall survival rate was 1.8%. Penetrating injury had a 4.2% survival and blunt injury 1.1%. No patients with CPR initiated at the scene and required throughout transport survived. In those patients with both blood pressure and spontaneous respirations present in the field, survival rate was 11.8%. Survival rate in patients manifesting sinus rhythm or ventricular fibrillation upon arrival at the ER was 6.4%. No survivors were noted among patients coming to the hospital with an idioventricular rhythm or asystole. The total hospital charges for patients undergoing ERT exceeded reimbursement by $59,565. Screening for HIV and hepatitis could be documented in only two patients; both were negative. Liberal performance of ERT has dismal results, incurs monetary loss, and affords a greater potential for exposure to lethal infection. Emergency room thoracotomy is justified only when vital signs or a resuscitatible cardiac rhythm are present in the field or ER and deteriorate shortly before thoracotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Twenty-eight patients with 34 fractures were treated with early operative fixation. The mean TBSA burned was 20%. Ten fractures were open (4 grade I, 5 grade II, and 1 grade III) and 24 were closed. Seventy-five percent of patients had a definitive orthopedic procedure within 24 hours of burn. Intramedullary nails were used in 13, ORIF in 15, external fixation in 3, and percutaneous fixation in 4. Ten patients had burns overlying the fracture site and the surgical incision was made through burned tissue. Four were associated with open fractures. Two orthopedic complications occurred: nonunion of a femoral neck fracture and angulation of a tibial plateau fracture. The goal of orthopedic management in the polytrauma burn patient is to achieve early reduction to allow optimal wound care and early patient mobility.

To explore the implications of such a policy, we reviewed the records of 82 patients with hepatic injuries noted at laparotomy. Indications for laparotomy were positive findings on diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) or CT scan, or a history of penetrating trauma. The liver injuries were graded according to severity: grade I, 19 patients; grade II, 20 patients (low severity = LS); grade III, 14 patients; grade IV, 6 patients (high severity = HS). Twenty-three injuries were not classified by the operating surgeon. Of the 53 patients with blunt hepatic trauma, 23 (43%) had concomitant injuries that required operative intervention. Twenty-nine patients had penetrating liver injuries. Fourteen (48%) had associated injuries requiring intervention. Patients most likely to have nonoperative management, those with grade I and grade II liver injuries (LS), comprised 48 of the total. In this subgroup there were 26 (54.2%) associated injuries requiring operative intervention. Shock could not be used as a factor to differentiate patients not requiring operative intervention. Nineteen of the LS patients requiring operative intervention secondary to associated injury were never in shock. In adult trauma victims positive DPL findings secondary to minor hepatic injuries that might not require operative intervention serve as a marker for associated injuries that do require operation. The risk of nonoperative management of hepatic injuries based upon radiologic diagnosis is not the result of complications from the hepatic injury.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Diagnosis of cardiac injury in stable patients suffering penetrating precordial trauma has relied on observation, subxiphoid window, or exploratory thoracotomy. Previous reports have stressed the need for an alternative noninvasive diagnostic test. Although the use of echocardiography (ECHO) in this patient population has been suggested, to our knowledge no report thus far has presented extensive experience with this technique. We present our experience over 3 years with 36 patients in whom emergent ECHO was used as part of their initial work-up. Injuries included single stab wounds (17), multiple stab wounds (14), and gunshot wounds (5). Four patients (11%) had jugular venous distention, and 12 (33%) were tachycardic. None had a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Four ECHOs (11%) were positive for pericardial effusion. No valvular abnormalities were detected. Three of the effusions were small and these patients were triaged to monitored beds and observed. All three effusions resolved on serial echocardiography. The fourth patient underwent an uneventful operative repair of a left ventricular laceration. Although the yield is low, emergent 2-D ECHO is a valuable tool in the triage of stable penetrating trauma patients when cardiac injury is suspected. Patients without effusion can be discharged or triaged to a ward bed. Small effusions can be observed in a monitored setting with serial examinations, while large effusions should be treated surgically. Echocardiography is less expensive than ICU admission and less invasive than either subxiphoid window or thoracotomy. There are no known complications associated with the procedure and it is recommended for emergent use when available.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty (44.2%) of 294 patients hospitalized for trauma and admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for mechanical ventilation developed hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The predominant pathogens isolated were gram-negative enteric bacilli (72%), but there was not an increase in mortality associated with gram-negative pneumonia compared with similar patients without pneumonia. Of the seven admission risk factors univariately associated with the development of acquired bacterial pneumonia, only emergent intubation (p less than 0.001), head injury (p less than 0.001), hypotension on admission (p less than 0.001), blunt trauma as the mechanism of injury (p less than 0.001), and Injury Severity Score (p less than 0.001) remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. Not surprisingly, as mechanical ventilation is continued, the probability of pneumonia emerging increases. The consequences of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia are a significant seven-, five-, and two-fold increase in mechanically ventilated days, intensive care, and hospital stay, respectively. We conclude that the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia in injured patients admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation occurs in nearly half the patients, is associated with specific risk factors, and significantly increases morbidity but does not increase mortality.\r"

  ".W": "After a decade of intense fiscal scrutiny, appropriate utilization of intensive care resources remains controversial. In particular, the financial impact of patients transferred to a tertiary surgical intensive care unit (SICU) from a community hospital (interhospital) is unknown, especially when compared with elective (intrahospital) SICU admissions admitted from the tertiary center itself. We prospectively studied outcome and costs in 82 consecutive tertiary SICU admissions. Half were transferred acutely from community hospitals and half were transferred from within the hospital or postoperatively. Severity of illness (APACHE II) was scored on day 1, at the same time of the day (9:00-10:00 AM) and by one attending surgeon (BCB). Acute transfer patients had a significantly elevated mortality (36%) when compared with elective admissions (12%) (p less than 0.05). When stratified by APACHE II score, acute transfers had twice the mortality for equivalent APACHE II scores (p less than 0.05). Acute transfer patients with APACHE II scores greater than 19 had an 89% mortality; those nonsurvivors cost $128,652 each. From these results we conclude the following: (1) Acute transfer patients have a significantly elevated mortality when compared with elective intrahospital admissions with equivalent APACHE II day-1 scores; (2) patients transferred acutely to tertiary SICUs are significantly more costly, irrespective of outcome; (3) admission source (elective vs. acute transfer) should be seriously considered when evaluating patient outcome and cost in a SICU.\r"

  ".U": "91303630\r", 
  ".W": "There is a widespread perception that many trauma centers are poorly reimbursed, and many hospitals that once cared for trauma victims no longer do so, primarily for financial reasons. The problem is blamed on both uninsured and underinsured patients, but data supporting this perception are lacking. To determine the validity of these perceptions and to better understand the nature of trauma center reimbursement, a survey was conducted. A questionnaire on the volume of trauma seen annually and the reimbursement experience for trauma center (TC) and hospital (HO) patient populations was mailed to representative but nonrandomly chosen trauma centers. Seventy-one surveys were mailed and 25 were returned (35%). There were 15 Level I and 10 Level II centers; 16 were urban, seven were suburban, and two were rural. Eighteen centers (72%) reported significant underfunding of the TC in contrast to the HO, and 11 indicated that they would not be able to continue their current level of TC services with present reimbursement. For Medicare patients, HO cost recovery rates averaged 93%, but recovery rates were only 64% for TCs. For Medicaid beneficiaries, the HO cost recovery rate averaged 85%, but it was only 49% for TCs. Thirty-one percent of TC patients had no insurance coverage at all, in contrast to only 9% of HO patients. An aggregate loss equal to 19.9% of total costs was reported by respondents. This survey, while not representative of trauma centers as a whole throughout the United States, does suggest that there is a basis for the perception of underfunding of trauma care and indicates that such underfunding results from the combination of adverse selection and disproportionate share. We also describe a new method for assessing and comparing trauma center reimbursement.\r"

During maximal postresuscitation fluid retention, plasma volume (PV/RISA), red cell volume (RBC/51Cr), inulin space (ECF), and COP were measured. Interstitial space (IFS), PV/IFS ratio, and correlation coefficients (r) were calculated. A subgroup of 22 SS patients and 22 HS patients of equal study weight were also compared. Septic patients had greater IFS expansion (17.6 L vs. 11.5 L) than HS patients who, by inference, had more intracellular expansion. Expansion of IFS in SS patients correlated (r = -0.76, p less than 0.02) with reduced plasma COP; this was not seen in HS patients (r = -0.09, p less than 0.35). In contrast, plasma COP correlated (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001) with PV/RISA in HS patients but not in SS patients (r = 0.09, p greater than 0.35). We conclude: (1) SS patients with greater IFS expansion that correlates with reduced plasma COP likely have increased capillary permeability; and (2) HS patients with less IFS expansion that does not correlate with reduced plasma COP likely have maintained capillary permeability with altered IFS matrix configuration causing reduced protein exclusion.\r"

Over a range 0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 microgram/kg/min BRADY was infused into the femoral artery of anesthetized dogs while lymph was collected from the hind paw. After 4 hours of continuous BRADY, venous pressure was increased 20 to 30 mm Hg by tightening a tourniquet around the thigh to further increase lymph flow and achieve a filtration-independent lymph-plasma ratio, for albumin (R Alb), immunoglobulin G (R IgG), and immunoglobulin M (R IgM). These proteins were measured with immunoelectrophoresis and immunodiffusion. MEAN +/- SD, * p less than 0.05, ANOVA, DIFFERENT FROM LOWER DOSE. [Formula: see text] BRADY caused a dose-related increase in microvascular permeability up to 0.4 microgram/kg/min. The increase in the lymph-plasma ratio for the large plasma proteins (IgM, molecular radius 110 A) is of the same magnitude as for albumin, (molecular radius 36 A), and this suggests BRADY increased the number but not the size of \"large pores\" in the microvascular membrane.\r"

For a successful assault on this major health epidemic, a cooperative effort between those involved in the development of prevention strategies and those involved in the care of the injured patient must develop. For our society to accept some of these prevention strategies, the rights of the community as a whole will have to be allowed to prevail over the rights of the individual. To facilitate this process, a National Advisory Committee on Injury in Canada needs to be formed. Its mandate will be to develop a set of national objectives on injury morbidity and mortality, to establish a national trauma registry, and to implement specific programs--a strategic plan. Only through a coalition of efforts between all groups involved with injury can we hope to lower the prevalence of injury in Canada.\r"

It has been suggested that the probability of survival is improved in hospitals treating greater than 200 trauma patients annually. We sought to determine if probability of survival was lower in our small volume centre. Between 1986 and 1989, 752 (522 male, 230 female; average age, 36 years) trauma patients were admitted to our institution. The major mechanism of injury was blunt (89%). All patients underwent trauma severity scoring. Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and a Revised Trauma Score were used to derived the probability of survival by the TRISS method. The mean Injury Severity Score was 23.3 and the mean Trauma Score was 13.2. The overall mortality rate was 15.8%. The Z statistic demonstrated no significant difference between actual and predicted deaths for the 4-year period or for any individual year (range, -1.05 to 1.26, p greater than 0.05). The M statistic was 0.753. We conclude that, despite fewer trauma patient admissions (less than 200 per year), comparable clinical results can be achieved by surgeons dedicated to trauma management.\r"

Various \"audit filters\" to identify which patients' charts should be reviewed have been proposed. An analysis of all patients admitted to the Regional Trauma Unit (RTU) over a 19-month period was conducted. Of 729 patients, 135 were identified as having suffered a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (TICH). On review, neither delay in transfer from the emergency room to the operating room nor increasing time from the incident to the operating room correlated with increasing mortality. In contrast to delay, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission correlated well with outcome. The charts of patients with anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score were reviewed, and two possibly preventable deaths were identified. There were 48 patients with TICH who had no operations but there were no deaths attributable to a missed operation. There were 76 patients for whom the GCS score at the referring hospital and the GCS score on admission to the RTU were available. Seven of 19 patients who worsened on transfer declined because of significant pulmonary injuries. Anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score and declining GCS scores are recommended as quality assurance filters.\r"

A prospective study of patients with blunt chest trauma was undertaken at a Regional Trauma Unit between January 1, 1989 and March 31, 1990. One hundred ninety-one patients were entered into the study; 72-hour Holter monitoring was performed in 183 patients, and radionuclide angiography (RNA) was performed on 163 patients. All patients had CPK levels (with CPK-mb fractions) measured, and serial electrocardiographs. There were seven patients with abnormal RNA studies; five of the seven abnormal studies were attributable to previously undiagnosed coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. Nine patients were diagnosed as having atrial fibrillation, seven of whom were in atrial fibrillation on admission. Ventricular dysrhythmias were classified by the number of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) per hour or the presence of ventricular tachycardia. Twelve patients developed short runs of ventricular tachycardia, and clinically insignificant PVCs were common. Only one patient with ventricular dysrhythmias (frequent PVCs) was treated and there were no hemodynamically significant dysrhythmias. The incidence of clinically significant dysrhythmias or hemodynamically significant myocardial contusion appears to be low in this patient population. Aggressive investigation and monitoring solely for cardiac complications may not be indicated.\r"

Chest trauma in multiply injured patients resulted in higher Injury Severity Scores (ISSs) than the average. This was reflected in higher mortality for patients with chest trauma. The majority of injuries were caused by blunt trauma. Less than 9% of patients admitted to the hospital required thoracotomy for thoracic vascular and cardiac trauma. Outcome (measured by mortality) was better than that predicted from the literature based on admission ISS. The etiology of trauma in this Canadian setting and the resulting injury profiles were substantially different from those obtained from the predominantly American epidemiologic data available in the literature. This suggests the need for gathering more Canadian population-based trauma data for the planning of trauma prevention and care in this country.\r"

Injury to motor vehicle occupants was less likely to result in IML. The present study defines predictors of severe torso injury (STI) in 646 patients admitted to a trauma unit and compares these with predictors of IML obtained in the previous study. Tachycardia and low blood pressure were associated with an increased incidence of STI (p = 0.003, p = 0.0000). The incidence of STI in falls differed from that of IML (13.2% vs. 47.7%, p less than 0.001). There was a greater incidence of STI than IML in MVAs (33.6% vs. 14.8%, p less than 0.001). Patients 70 years of age or older had a higher incidence of IMLs than STIs (p less than 0.001). Patients less than 30 years old had a significantly greater incidence of STIs than IMLs (p less than 0.001). These data suggest that in MVA victims who are less than 30 years old, are hypotensive, and tachycardic, the diagnosis and emergent treatment of severe torso injury should take precedence over measures designed to detect and treat intracranial mass lesions. The converse is true for older patients injured in falls.\r"

  ".W": "In order to provide improved shunting of caval blood around the liver for major juxtahepatic venous injuries, a modification of the venovenous bypass (active shunt) used in liver transplantation was developed. Using a porcine model, hemodynamic comparisons of active shunting with an interposed Bio-Medicus pump (group I: n = 6) and passive shunting (group II: n = 4) around the liver for 60 minutes were made. One end of the shunt was placed in the infrahepatic cava and the other end was inserted into the right atrium. Systolic blood pressure (sBP) and cardiac output (CO) were well maintained in group I. However, with passive shunting (group II), sBP fell from 134 +/- 28 to 83 +/- 28 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and CO fell from 4.1 +/- 0.07 to 1.3 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.001) after 1 hour. The well-maintained sBP and CO in group I were associated with much better shunt flow rates than in group II (31 +/- 7 vs. 11 +/- 3 mL/kg/min) (p less than 0.001). The cause of the fall in sBP and CO with the passive shunt (group II) in spite of a well-maintained PAWP is unclear at this time. Thus, it appears that active shunting of blood around the liver using a venovenous bypass with a pump is much superior hemodynamically to passive shunting, which relies only on hydrostatic pressure.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE. To describe the epidemiology of recent unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning deaths in the United States. DESIGN. Descriptive analysis of carbon monoxide-related deaths in the United States from 1979 through 1988, based on death certificate reports compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics. POPULATION STUDIED. All US deaths, 1979 through 1988. RESULTS. We reviewed data from 56,133 death certificates that contained codes implicating carbon monoxide as a contributing cause of death. Of these, 25,889 were suicides, 210 were homicides, 15,523 were associated with severe burns or house fires, and 11,547 were classified as unintentional. The number of unintentional deaths decreased steadily by about 63 deaths per year, from 1513 in 1979 to 878 in 1988. The highest death rates occurred in winter and among males, blacks, the elderly, and residents of northern states. Motor vehicle exhaust gas caused 6552 (57%) of the unintentional deaths; 5432 (83%) of these were associated with stationary automobiles. CONCLUSIONS. The rate of unintentional death from carbon monoxide poisoning is decreasing. This may be attributable to improvements in automobile pollution control systems and improved safety of cooking and heating appliances. Prevention programs should target young drivers, males, and the elderly.\r"

Six-month case series of inhalational exposures reported to a poison control center with follow-up, structured interviews of subjects. SETTING. A regional poison control center providing 24-hour telephone consultation to health professionals and the public. PATIENTS. Consecutive sample of 683 inhalation cases, with interviews of 323 subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS. Moderate to severe irritants accounted for 160 (50%) of the inhalational exposures in interviewed subjects. Persistent symptoms lasting 14 days or longer were reported by only 20 (6%) of the subjects. Irritant exposure was a statistically significant risk factor for acute respiratory symptoms (relative risk [RR] = 1.7; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.4 to 2.1) but was unrelated to persistent symptoms. Preexisting lung conditions (RR = 2.4; 95% Cl, 1.4 to 4.2) and cigarette smoking (RR = 1.7; 95% Cl, 1.3 to 2.2) were both statistically significant risk factors for persistent symptoms. CONCLUSIONS. Symptomatic inhalational exposures due to irritants are frequent in reports from poison control centers. Residual morbidity was uncommon and did not appear to be statistically related to the degree of irritant exposure. Host-related factors may be better predictors of ongoing morbidity after inhalational exposure.\r"

Illustrative agents include radon, indoor asbestos, environmental tobacco smoke, acidic aerosols, and oxidant gases. Tremendous progress has been made in understanding and preventing environmental lung diseases. However, we remain concerned about adverse consequences of breathing polluted outdoor and indoor air. In the persistent concerns about adverse effects of polluted air on the lung, a new emphasis is pervasive; the focus has shifted from avoiding clinical disease among highly exposed individuals to protecting the population from an unacceptable burden of risk. The technique of quantitative risk assessment has become increasingly important for characterizing the safety of environmental agents. The resulting emphasis on the final risk projection and attendant uncertainties may overly emphasize gaps in our knowledge.\r"

  ".W": "Occupational diseases account each year in the United States for an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 deaths and 350,000 new cases of illness. Often, however, occupational diseases are not correctly diagnosed, because they mimic diseases due to other causes and because most physicians are not well trained in their recognition. Opportunities for prevention and treatment are therefore lost. The occupational history is the most effective means for proper diagnosis of occupational illness. It should routinely be obtained for every patient. A brief but systematic guide for obtaining an occupational history is presented in this report. Also, approaches are summarized for the recognition and diagnosis of such important occupational diseases as occupational cancer, asbestosis and other respiratory disorders, and occupational neuropsychologic disorders. The management and prevention of occupational diseases depend on reduction of hazardous exposures in the workplace and better education of workers, industrial managers, and physicians. This report outlines a program for the control of occupational disease based on (1) preventing exposures in the workplace, (2) premarket toxicity testing of new chemicals and technologies, and (3) astute clinical diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Environmental, occupational, and recreational exposures to carcinogens contribute to cancer risk in humans. Cancer formation is a multistage process involving tumor initiation, promotion, conversion, and progression. Carcinogens can affect any of these stages through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The association of a suspected carcinogenic exposure and cancer risk can be studied in populations with classic epidemiologic techniques. However, these techniques are not applicable to the assessment of risk in individuals. Molecular epidemiology, in contrast, is a field that integrates molecular biology, in vitro and in vivo laboratory models, biochemistry, and epidemiology to infer individual cancer risk. Carcinogen-macromolecular adduct levels, and somatic cell mutations can be measured to determine the biologically effective dose of a carcinogen. Molecular epidemiology also explores host cancer susceptibilities, such as carcinogen metabolic activation, DNA repair, endogenous mutation rates, and inheritance of mutated tumor suppressor genes. Substantial interindividual variation for each of these biologic end points has been shown and, therefore, highlights the need for assessing cancer risk on an individual basis. Given the pace of the last decade, it is feasible that the next 10 years will allow molecular epidemiologists to develop a cancer-risk profile for an individual that includes assessment of a number of factors. This will help focus preventive strategies and strengthen quantitative risk assessments.\r"

PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers.\r"

All represented examples of DCIS retrieved after pathologic examination of a much larger cohort of patients with stage I and II invasive breast cancer enrolled in NSABP protocol 6. Local breast recurrences were similar for women with DCIS and those from this cohort at a similar period of follow-up with invasive cancer treated by L only (43% vs. 39%) and L + XRT (7% vs. 10%). The presence of moderate/marked comedonecrosis was suggestively related to local breast recurrence (P = .07). This latter was significantly reduced for patients receiving post L XRT (P = .01). All local breast recurrences in this study and 29 of 31 recorded by others occurred at or close to the site of extirpation of the index cancer minimizing multicentricity as a contraindication for the conservative surgical treatment of DCIS. Survival rates which were similar for patients with DCIS regardless of form of local treatment were better than that observed for negative node patients with invasive cancer enrolled in protocol 6. Thus, DCIS is a less, not more, ominous disease than invasive cancer. This and other features of its natural history indicate that it would be a contradiction to treat invasive cancer but not DCIS conservatively.\r"

The mean greatest diameter of 87 PH was 3.5 cm compared with 2.7 cm of 149 Am and 2.7 cm of DCBD. Histopathologically, 40% of Am were papillary adenocarcinoma, while about half of DCBD, PH and Du were tubular adenocarcinoma. PH invaded lymphatic (85%), vascular (62%), and perineural (95%) spaces and metastasized lymph nodes (72%) more frequently than Am (77%, 35%, 24%, 50%), DCBD (47%, 61%, 65%, 45%), and Du (76%, 29%, 35%, 65%), respectively. More than 50% of PH invaded the resected margins, whereas in only 2% of Am, the surgical margins were affected by malignant cells. Immunohistochemically, PH was more frequently positive for both carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (98%) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 (91%) than Am (83%, 62%), DCBD (94%, 58%), and Du (56%, 11%), respectively. The stromal staining type of CEA and CA 19-9 was more frequently seen in PH (27%, 44%) than in Am (9%, 31%), DCBD (11%, 8%) and Du (0%, 0%), showing a more dedifferentiated nature of PH. The cumulative 3-year survival rate of 87 patients with PH (15%) was worse than that of 149 with Am (42%, P less than 0.001), of 51 with DCBD (25%) and of 17 with Du (58%, P less than 0.001). The survival curve of 87 with PH was worse than that of 51 with DCBD, of 149 with Am (P less than 0.001) and of 17 with Du (P less than 0.001). Cox regression analysis, using eleven profound prognostic variables, revealed that venous invasion, perineural infiltration, surgical margin, and histopathologic type were profound prognostic factors. Pancreatic carcinoma has a more dedifferentiated histopathologic nature, showing a more aggressive growth and fares worse than Am, DCBD, and Du.\r"

They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology. Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases. All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter. Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia. In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere. Gastrointestinal \"lipomata\" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy. However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma.\r"

Intraoperative complications occurred at a rate of 9.7% and involved injuries to the great vessels, lower urinary tract, nerves, and rectum. Operative mortality was found to be 0.3%. Postoperative complications were observed in 20.1% of patients. Fistulae were observed in 8 (2.8%) patients. The overall survival rate was 83.8%. The 5-year survival rates for stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB were 100.0%, 87.9%, 71.0%, and 64.0%, respectively. Pelvic lymph node metastases varied from 0% for stage IA to 40.0% for stage IIB and paraaortic involvement varied from 0% for stage IA to 50.0% for stage IIB. Radical surgery seems to be the treatment of choice for patients with early invasive cervical cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The carcinoma SC42 was transplanted into the liver of its syngeneic mice DS, and the immunological integrity of the spleen and the effects of splenectomy on the growth and pulmonary metastasis of the liver tumor were assessed. On day 7 after liver tumor transplantation, the natural killer (NK) activity of the splenocytes was significantly elevated; it subsequently decreased at a later stage of the tumor. The response of the splenocytes to PHA and Con-A decreased significantly from the early stage of the tumor. However, the mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell reaction increased significantly from day 14 to day 28. The survival rate of the mice, which had undergone simultaneous splenectomy and liver tumor transplantation, was significantly lower than that of sham-operated control mice. The number of pulmonary metastases in splenectomized mice was significantly greater than in the control mice. There was, however, no difference between the two groups in the weight of the liver tumor. By contrast, splenectomies performed 14 days before or 14 days after tumor transplantation had no significant influence on the survival of the mice. Splenectomies performed on day 0 and on day 3 after tumor transplantation significantly increased the number of pulmonary metastases. Furthermore, the intravenous injection of anti-asialo GM1 antisera on day 0 and day 3 significantly increased the number of pulmonary metastases, but injection of anti-Thy 1.2 antisera had no effect. These results suggest that splenic NK cells may play an important role in the suppression of pulmonary metastasis at early stages of the liver tumor.\r"

  ".W": "In order to define prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma, univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out on data from 113 Japanese patients treated in a typical general hospital in Japan. In the univariate analysis, a poor prognosis was seen in those with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in tumors that perforated the visceral peritoneum or that invaded directly other organs or structures (T4), in metastasis to the nodes along the main vascular pedicle (N3), in lymphatic permeation, in blood vessel invasion, in peritoneal dissemination, in Dukes C stage, and in those with lesions presenting with large bowel obstruction. Of these, only lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination had an independent prognostic significance when a multivariate Cox analysis was performed. The significant risk factors related to an obstructing tumor were determined by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The significant variables were patient's age, nodal involvement and peritoneal dissemination. Since lymph node metastasis and peritoneal dissemination proved significant in both multivariate analyses, we propose that the presence of large bowel obstruction is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with colorectal carcinoma. In poor-risk patients who have an obstructing tumor, a staged operation should be attempted for definitive curative surgery.\r"

Splenomas bulged above the cut splenic surface, were pseudoencapsulated, and showed involvement of the underlying disease. A re-evaluation of 105 prior cases are adult (86%; age: 49), with 56% associated with neoplastic disease or hematologic abnormalities. Average spleen weight was 626 gm, and 22% contained multiple splenomas. We conclude that splenomas are most likely an acquired proliferative process strongly associated with neoplastic disease or hematologic abnormalities. Splenomas can also be congenital growths (hamartoma; 26% of the series), which are of little importance.\r"

  ".U": "91304010\r", 
  ".W": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma is usually a fatal cancer for which operation has been the mainstay of treatment because chemotherapy and radiation are relatively ineffective. The choice of operation for malignant pleural mesothelioma remains controversial. Extrapleural pneumonectomy has been advocated because it allows complete removal of gross tumor and can be associated with long-term survival. To evaluate extrapleural pneumonectomy, we conducted a prospective multiinstitutional trial in patients with biopsy-proved previously untreated malignant pleural mesothelioma. Criteria for extrapleural pneumonectomy were (1) potentially completely resectable unilateral disease by computed tomography scan, (2) predicted postresection forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 1 L/sec, and (3) no other major medical problems. Patients who were not candidates for extrapleural pneumonectomy had a more limited operation with or without adjuvant therapy or had nonsurgical treatment. From September 1985 to June 1988 83 eligible patients (64 male, 19 female) were entered. The mean age for all patients was 59.7 years. Only 20 of the 83 patients (24%) underwent extrapleural pneumonectomy. Three of these 20 patients (15%) died postoperatively. The recurrence-free survival was significantly longer for the patients undergoing extrapleural pneumonectomy than for the other two groups (p = 0.03), but there was no difference in overall survival among the three groups. In univariate analyses, epithelial versus sarcomatoid and mixed histologic findings and platelet count less than 400,000 were associated with a better overall survival (p = 0.02), and performance status (Karnofsky less than 80) was predictive of recurrence (p = 0.02). In a multivariate analysis, histologic findings, sex, age, extrapleural pneumonectomy, weight loss, and performance status all had no significant impact on survival. Extrapleural pneumonectomy was associated with a greater likelihood of relapse in distant sites than were limited operation and nonsurgical treatment. We conclude that (1) only a small proportion of all patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma are candidates for extrapleural pneumonectomy, (2) extrapleural pneumonectomy carries a significant operative mortality and does not seem to improve overall survival compared with more conservative forms of treatment, (3) extrapleural pneumonectomy alters the patterns of relapse, and (4) factors previously thought to have an impact on survival in other series did not affect outcome in this trial.\r"

Extrapleural pneumonectomy alone has proved disappointing in the treatment of this disease, as have chemotherapy and radiotherapy. From 1980 to 1990, 31 patients with pleural mesothelioma underwent multimodality therapy that included extrapleural pneumonectomy with resection of the pericardium and diaphragm. The age of the patients was 53.4 +/- 8.6 years; 26 were male. All patients had the pathologic diagnosis reviewed before treatment. At thoracotomy six patients had residual (unresectable) gross disease, and in 23 there was histologic evidence of disease at the resection margin. The perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 19% and 6%, respectively. The mean length of hospital stay for the 29 patients who survived the operation was 10.9 +/- 3.5 days. Postoperatively 26 patients received cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cis-platinum chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. The survival rates were 70% at 1 year and 48% at 2 years. Trends toward improved survival in the patients with complete resections approached but did not reach statistical significance. These data suggest that this multimodality protocol can be administered with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Prospective trials are justified to further clarify the role of this approach.\r"

  ".W": "Flow velocity of the right middle cerebral artery was studied in eight children during cardiac operations performed with profound hypothermia. Cerebral oxygen consumption was estimated by relating the difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood (jugular bulb) to flow velocity. In another six children, also during profound hypothermic procedures, the diameter of the middle cerebral artery was studied with an electronic echo-tracking instrument connected to a real-time ultrasound scanner. Flow velocity and estimated oxygen consumption decreased during cooling in proportion to the temperature decrease (r = 0.67, p less than 0.001, and r = 0.86, p less than 0.001, respectively), whereas the diameter was unaffected by temperature. At a nasopharyngeal temperature of 16.9 degrees +/- 1.9 degrees C flow velocity was reduced to 33.1% +/- 7.0% of the value obtained at 35 degrees C after induction of anesthesia. Correspondingly, the oxygen consumption decreased to 20.1% +/- 6.4%. The increase in oxygen consumption per 10 degrees C change in temperature was 3.6 (2.0 to 3.9) during surface cooling, 2.6 (1.9 to 2.7) during cardiopulmonary bypass cooling, and 2.7 (1.5 to 4.6) during rewarming. Flow velocity was not influenced by perfusion pressure during profound hypothermia within the range of 20 to 42 mm Hg (r = 0.14, p = 0.52) but was related to pump flow (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001). A pump flow down to 0.5 L/min/m2 was found to be adequate during stable profound hypothermia, as judged from the maintained high jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (70% to 80%). It is concluded that flow velocity is reduced at hypothermia in proportion to the reduced metabolic rate, although modified by other factors that influence cerebral blood flow.\r"

Again, this remained stable to 1 year. The exercise right ventricular ejection fraction also showed a significant posttransplantation rise in the double lung recipients (p less than 0.005) that remained stable to 1 year. In the single lung recipients a trend was seen for a rise in the exercise right ventricular ejection fraction that did not reach statistical significance by 1 year after transplantation. Neither group had a significant change in rest or exercise left ventricular ejection fraction. The systemic blood pressure increased significantly by 1 year after transplantation in both groups. The heart rate increase with exercise at 3 months after transplantation was significantly greater in the single lung group (42 +/- 13 beats/min) than in the double lung group (14 +/- 13 beats/min) (p less than 0.005).

  ".U": "91304014\r", 
  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that dynamic cardiomyoplasty produces beneficial changes in the functional mechanics of the dilated, failing left ventricle. Chronic dilated cardiomyopathy was induced in seven mongrel dogs by rapid ventricular pacing (260 beats/min) for 3 to 4 weeks. After completion of the induction period, dynamic cardiomyoplasty was performed with the left latissimus dorsi muscle, paced synchronously with the R waves of the electrocardiogram (Medtronic SP1005). Instruments included an aortic flow probe, a left ventricular Millar pressure catheter, and piezoelectric sonomicrometric crystals on the left ventricle for measurements of wall thickness and minor and major axis dimensions. Data were obtained with the stimulator off and on. Statistical comparisons were made with Student's t test for paired data. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty increased the cardiac output of the failing heart (966 +/- 124 versus 1166 +/- 112 ml/min; p less than 0.01). Systolic shortening of both minor and major axis dimensions increased (3.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.7 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.01, and 4.6 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.9 mm, p less than 0.05, respectively). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased by 16% (18 +/- 1 versus 15 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Although skeletal muscle contraction increased the pressure development in the left ventricular chamber, mean systolic wall stress was diminished by concomitant changes in left ventricular dimensions (116,144 +/- 11,530 versus 101,268 +/- 7464 dynes/cm2, p less than 0.05). At end-systole, wall thickness increased (11.8 +/- 1.1 versus 12.7 +/- 1.1 mm, p less than 0.01), minor axis dimension decreased (51.3 +/- 1.4 versus 49.2 +/- 1.8 mm, p less than 0.01), and major axis dimension also decreased (85.6 +/- 3.3 versus 79.0 +/- 2.3 mm, p less than 0.05). Our detailed evaluation of left ventricular chamber mechanics suggests that dynamic cardiomyoplasty may have a role in ameliorating the functional and mechanical derangements associated with progression of dilated cardiomyopathy both by augmenting cardiac performance and by diminishing determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption.

  ".W": "Dynamic cardiomyoplasty has been reported in the treatment of severe myocardial failure. In this investigation significant improvement of left ventricular function with dynamic cardiomyoplasty was demonstrated in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or Chagas' disease for more than 1 year of follow-up. Thirteen patients with advanced heart failure who were in New York Heart Association class III or IV were operated on. There were no operative deaths. Patients were followed up for a mean of 11.5 months, and two patients died during the late follow-up period. Five of nine patients observed long term are in New York Heart Association class I, three in class II, and one in class III. At 3 months of follow-up, Doppler echocardiography demonstrated that left ventricular segmental wall shortening increased from 11.4% +/- 2.3% to 16.4% +/- 3.9% (p less than 0.01), and left ventricular stroke volume from 23.9 +/- 5.7 to 34.4 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.01). Radioisotopic left ventricular ejection fraction improved from 20.9% +/- 3.3% to 25.4% +/- 7.7% (p = 0.06), and its better increases occurred in patients with lesser left ventricular end-diastolic dimensions. Cardiac catheterization showed that left ventricular stroke work index increased from 14.6 +/- 3.8 to 23.7 +/- 6.7 gm.m/m2 (p less than 0.01), whereas pulmonary wedge pressure decreased from 24.8 +/- 3.7 to 17.2 +/- 5.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). At 6 and 12 months of follow-up, all the preceding values remained essentially unchanged. Thus cardiomyoplasty improves left ventricular function and may halt the steady evolution of severe cardiomyopathies.\r"

In transposition of the great arteries the ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 70 cases, trabecular in 28, and infundibular in 10. Eleven patients had multiple ventricular septal defects. In addition to 18 patients with double-outlet right ventricle, malalignment of the conal septum was present in 19 cases. Coronary type A distribution was recognized in 79 cases, type C in one, type D in 24, and type E in 14. Great arteries were side by side in 19% of cases. Aortic coarctation was present in 31 cases, and subaortic obstruction in 9. Age at operation ranged from 4 days to 4 years (mean, 3.5 +/- 8.3 months), and mean weight was 4.0 +/- 1.6 kg. Thirty-seven infants were younger than age 1 month. Thirty-six patients underwent previous operations: pulmonary artery banding alone (n = 13), pulmonary artery banding and coarctation repair (n = 13), and coarctation repair alone (n = 10). Mean time between the first procedure and the switch was 2.2 months. Six patients with aortic coarctation underwent one-stage repair, through median sternotomy, aortic reconstruction, closure of the ventricular septal defect, and arterial switch. Perioperative mortality was 13.5% (70% confidence limit 10% to 17.6%, n = 16). It was directly related to coronary artery kinking in 50% of deaths and to anatomy and size discrepancy of the great arteries in the remaining deaths. Univariate analysis could not find any significant risk factor of in-hospital mortality. Mean follow-up of 30.3 +/- 23.5 months was achieved in all but 2 survivors. There was one late death. Ten patients underwent 11 reoperations for recoarctation (n = 1), pulmonary stenosis (n = 7), residual ventricular septal defect (n = 2), and stenosis of superior vena cava (n = 1). Two patients needed a permanent pacemaker. Actuarial survival and freedom from reoperation at 5 years were 84.5% +/- 3.6% and 85.7% +/- 4.6%, respectively. We conclude that anatomic correction of complex transposition is a safe method that offers good early and midterm results.\r"

This article reviews the cases in which extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was used as an adjunct to pediatric cardiac transplantation. Twenty children, aged 7 days to 17 years, with cardiac failure refractory to conventional therapy received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for 6 to 192 hours. In 4 cases it was used as a bridge to transplantation; in 10 cases it facilitated resuscitation of the cardiac allograft in the immediate postoperative period; and in 6 cases it complemented therapy for severe rejection in the late postoperative period. Twelve patients survived extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, 7 of whom lived more than 8 months. One long-term survivor was in the bridge-to-transplant group, 4 in the immediate postoperative group, and 2 in the rejection group. All survivors have normal cardiac allograft function. These data suggest that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used to support profound cardiac failure in the pediatric heart transplant patient as a bridge to transplantation, in the resuscitation of the cardiac allograft, or to supplement a rejecting allograft.\r"

Since 1973 we have performed 37 carinal resections for bronchogenic carcinoma: 21 right carinal pneumonectomies, 7 carinal resections, 7 carina plus lobe resections, and 2 carina plus pneumonectomy stump resections. Five patients had diseased N2 nodes and 13 patients had diseased N1 nodes. Complications included pulmonary (8), vocal cord paresis (3), atrial fibrillation (9), anastomotic stenosis (4), and anastomotic separation (3). There were 3 early postoperative deaths (8%). All were related to adult respiratory distress syndrome and were unresponsive to aggressive treatment. There were 4 late postoperative deaths between 2 and 4 months (10.9%). All late postoperative deaths were related to anastomotic complications (stenosis [1] and separation [3]). There are 5 absolute 5-year survivors and an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 19%.\r"

  ".W": "Long-term results and patterns of disease recurrences after radical operations for lung cancer between 1975 and 1984 were investigated. Eight hundred fifty-two patients (76.1%) with lung cancer underwent operations during this period. Radical operations were performed on 648 patients. There were 326 (50.6%) pneumonectomies, 314 (48.5%) lung resections (lobectomies), and 8 (1.2%) segmentectomies. Long-term survival rates of 542 patients were studied. In 49.2% of the patients survival was beyond 3 years; in 33% of the patients it was beyond 5 years. Five-year survival was observed in 40.3% +/- 2.5% of patients with N1 and in 19% +/- 4.9% of patients with N2 disease. The differences in survival rates between patients with epidermoid cancer and adenocarcinoma were slight and statistically insignificant. The prognosis was poor in patients with small-cell cancer, large-cell cancer, and dimorphous cancer. The causes of death were studied in 193 patients. Disease recurrence was diagnosed in 75.1% of cases. Bronchopulmonary and concomitant diseases accounted for 19.7% of deaths in these patients. In 5.2% of the patients malignant tumors occurred in other organs. Local-regional recurrences were diagnosed in 33.8% of patients, distant metastases occurred in 55.2% of patients, and 11% of patients had combined disease recurrences. The problem of disease recurrence classification is discussed in the article.\r"

  ".W": "Acquired tracheal stenosis in childhood is frequently difficult to manage because of poor healing, infection, and scarring. In a 10-year period, 62 patients (4 weeks to 14 years of age) were treated for acquired tracheal stenosis. The causes of stenosis were endotracheal intubation (44 patients), caustic aspiration (6 patients), recurrent infection (5 patients), bronchoscopic perforation (4 patients), and gastric aspiration (3 patients). The subglottic or upper trachea was involved in 47 patients, mid portion in 8, and distal or carinal area in 7. Fifty children underwent tracheostomy as part of the therapy, and 12 were managed without tracheostomy. Therapy was individualized, frequently sequentially, utilizing rigid or balloon dilatation (20 patients), bronchoscopic electrocoagulation resection (44 patients), steroid injection (48 patients), T tube stent (8 patients), resection with anastomosis (12 patients), cricoid split (3 patients), and rib cartilage graft (12 patients). Most patients required several techniques and repeated procedures to eventually achieve decannulation. Seven patients (11%) died of unrelated causes. Forty-four of 55 surviving patients (80%) are without tracheostomy, although 14 have required continued endotracheal treatment after tracheostomy removal (dilatation, endotracheal resection). This series demonstrates that acquired tracheal stenosis in childhood is a common, difficult problem, but manageable with the use of a variety of techniques. Resection and grafting procedures should be reserved for cases in which less complex modalities fail.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1985, 57 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction have undergone surgical resection. In this group, 16 of the tumors arose in a Barrett's esophagus. There was a significant predilection toward white men above the age of 55 (15/16; 94%) in this subgroup. The mean proximal extent of abnormal columnar involvement was 5.4 cm above the gastroesophageal junction (range 2.5 to 11 cm). The mean location of the neoplasm centered in the distal esophagus 1.8 +/- 0.5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. During the same time period, 30 patients with Barrett's esophagus were seen without associated adenocarcinoma. There were no statistical differences in the proximal extent of columnar involvement or the presence of reflux symptoms between the two groups. There were no significant differences in age, smoking history, and alcohol consumption between patients with benign or malignant Barrett's esophagus as compared to those with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction not associated with Barrett's mucosa. The marked male predominance seen in the group with malignant Barrett's esophagus was in contrast to the benign cases (16/30; 53%) but was similar to the adenocarcinoma group, without recognized Barrett's esophagus (38/41; 93%). The mean location of the tumor in the latter was 0.9 +/- 1.2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and was comparable to the location in the group with Barrett's adenocarcinoma. The 4-year survival rate of patients in the non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma group is approximately 30%. Of those with Barrett's adenocarcinoma, the present 4-year survival rate is 60%. The demographic and morphometric similarities between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma groups may be of primary importance in determining the true clinical prevalence of Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of endoscopic surveillance may be improved if biopsy specimens are concentrated within the distal 3 cm of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. Finally, the reason for the current difference in survival between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma groups is uncertain but may be related to endoscopic surveillance permitting earlier diagnosis and treatment.\r"
