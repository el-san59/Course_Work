  ".W": "To assess the effect of short-term alteration of left atrial pressure and volume on the circulating plasma level of atrial natriuretic factor, 11 patients with left atrial hypertension due to mitral stenosis were studied at the time of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. Hemodynamic measurements and plasma atrial natriuretic factor levels were obtained before, immediately (5 to 10 min) after and 24 h after valvuloplasty, and echocardiographic left atrial size was determined before and 24 h after valvuloplasty. Immediately after valvuloplasty, left atrial pressure decreased from 28 +/- 2 to 10 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.0005), mitral pressure gradient decreased from 20 +/- 2 to 7 +/- 1 mm Hg (p less than 0.0005), mitral valve area increased from 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.9 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p less than 0.0005) and plasma atrial natriuretic factor level rose from 249 +/- 42 to 348 +/- 50 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). This short-term rise in atrial natriuretic factor level may reflect a transient increase in left atrial pressure associated with balloon occlusion of the mitral valve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At study entry, patients received a single intravenous dose of 200 mg/kg of body weight (maximal dose, 12 g) of either J5-IVIG or IVIG. Of the 100 patients randomized, 71 (30 receiving J5-IVIG and 41 receiving IVIG) had a documented gram-negative infection. Mortality from gram-negative septic shock was 50% (15 of 30) in J5-IVIG recipients and 49% (20 of 41) in IVIG recipients. In addition, treatment with J5-IVIG did not reduce the number of systemic complications of shock and did not delay the occurrence of death due to septic shock. Thus we conclude that J5-IVIG was not superior to IVIG in reducing mortality or in reversing gram-negative septic shock.\r"

Meningococcal pilins could be separated into distinct groups based on reactivity with these probes. Common epitopes were conserved on meningococcal pilins isolated during laboratory passage and during infection of human nasopharyngeal organ cultures. Antibodies to common epitopes of pilin were, however, rarely detected in convalescent sera from patients with meningococcal or gonococcal bacteremia. Except for an epitope involving peptide sequence 48-60, immunoelectron microscopy indicated that common epitopes of pilin were not readily accessible on pili assembled on meningococci. Our antisera also did not block attachment of piliated meningococci to human buccal epithelial cells.\r"

Recently we identified an additional mechanism of T cell-mediated macrophage activation of defense against Leishmania that is apparently lymphokine-independent and cell contact-dependent but not cytotoxic to host cells. In the present study we determined that strains of Leishmania mexicana that are not susceptible to the antimicrobial effects that result from lymphokine activation are nonetheless susceptible to antileishmanial effects resulting from T cell contact-mediated macrophage activation. Lymphocytes capable of activating macrophages by the cell contact-dependent mechanism appeared transiently in C57BL/6 mice infected with one of these L. mexicana strains. Our findings provide further evidence for fundamental distinctions between lymphokine- and contact-mediated antileishmanial defense. The results suggest that in addition to resistance to lymphokine-mediated effects, suppression of cell contact-mediated defense may account for chronicity in these infections.\r"

Four women are described with a history of puerperal affective psychosis, who were given lithium prophylactically following delivery and had no recurrence of postpartum psychosis. The rationale for the timing, dosage, and monitoring of lithium administration in this situation is discussed. Given the apparent safety of lithium prophylaxis relative to the dangers of postpartum affective psychosis, more effort should be directed to definitive research to resolve whether lithium prophylaxis is indicated for this population, as contemporary knowledge and these four cases would suggest.\r"

Dramatic control of the seizures was obtained by surgical removal restricted to the angiomas and underlying cortex. There was recurrence of seizures in one patient from whom only one of two angiomatous areas was removed but not in the two patients whose excision was total. These cases indicate that secondary bilateral synchrony can occur with lesions of the posterior and external parts of one hemisphere. Surgical removal of a definable lesion, without intracranial recording, can help patients with intractable epilepsy due to unilateral pial angiomatosis, even in the presence of wide diffusion of clinical and electroencephalographic abnormalities.\r"

CSF pyruvate and lactate levels were elevated, and lactate content was elevated in the urine. There was an abnormally high rise of lactate levels on moderate exercise and an abnormal response to pyruvate loading. Quadriceps muscle biopsies obtained at age 10 and 16 years showed ragged-red fibres, and a decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity and cytochrome aa3 content. Cytochrome c oxidase activity in fibroblasts was normal. Clinical signs and symptoms in association with a disturbance of mitochondrial energy metabolism led us to diagnosis of probable Leigh syndrome.\r"

Details of the 11 patients, each of whom had EEG recordings in summer and in winter confirmed the relative rarity of PPD in summer compared with winter. This reflects a lower cerebral neuronal excitability in summer compared with winter. Mechanisms for this, though not clear, may be related to an increased amount of environmental sunshine during summer and/or reduced temperature during winter.\r"

  ".W": "The acute response to injury and infection is manifested by increased synthesis of acute-phase proteins by the liver, an increased white blood cell count, fever, a negative nitrogen balance, and altered serum mineral levels (zinc, iron, and copper). This response is thought to be partially mediated by cytokines such as interleukin-1, but has not been well studied in head-injured patients. In this study, 25 patients were studied for evidence of the acute-phase response extending from hospital admission up to 21 days postinjury. The patients were divided into two groups to determine if severity of injury influenced the response. Group 1 consisted of nine patients with admission peak 24-hour Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores of 4 or less; Group 2 consisted of 16 patients with admission peak 24-hour GCS scores of 8 or greater. All patients demonstrated some evidence of the acute-phase response. Serum alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin, and C-reactive protein levels were elevated on admission and throughout the study. Serum albumin and zinc levels were depressed on admission; zinc levels gradually normalized by Day 21 in both groups, but hypoalbuminemia was observed throughout the study period. Serum copper levels were normal on admission but increased to above normal in both groups by Day 11 postinjury. Urinary urea nitrogen excretion was elevated in both groups and peaked on Day 7 for Group 1 and Day 11 for Group 2 patients. The patients with admission GCS scores equal to or less than 4 had overall higher temperatures than were seen in those with GCS scores greater than or equal to 8 (p = 0.009). All patients but one had an elevated white blood cell count on admission. It is concluded that brain-injured patients with admission GCS scores of 3 to 4 and 8 to 14 demonstrate an acute-phase response which lasts for at least 3 weeks postinjury. It is speculated that this response is at least partially mediated by increased intraventricular interleukin-1 activity.\r"

The results were correlated with immunohistochemical localization of autologous albumin in the brain parenchyma on paraffin sections. Extravasation of serum albumin was evident in all rats, and the albumin immunoreactivity, commonly localized to the territories of the ipsilateral anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries and contralateral anterior cerebral artery, showed maximum intensity in the rats sacrificed 30 minutes after infusion. The albumin immunoreactivity remained macroscopically visible in the brain parenchyma for 24 to 48 hours, and then gradually faded out. Serum extravasation was accompanied by widening of the perivascular space and focal edema, which largely subsided within 48 hours as the albumin immunoreactivity of the tissue diminished. Although no overt neurological sequelae were seen in the present experiment, minute but definite foci of infarction with focal accumulation of albumin were found in 23 (38%) of 61 rats surviving more than 30 minutes. In addition, ischemic neuronal death of delayed onset was encountered among neurons in the CA-1 region of the hippocampus, in the cerebellum, and in the thalamus in five (25%) of 20 rats sacrificed between Days 4 and 6. Thus, care should be exercised in the practice of this procedure.\r"

Young and adult rats were fed ad libitum diets containing 18, 9, 6, 4 and 0.5% protein (wt/wt) or were fed a control diet in restricted amounts. The transthyretin level was lower in young rats and was normal or slightly higher in adult rats fed low protein diets than in those fed the 18% protein diet. It was decreased with decreasing energy intake in all energy-restricted rats. Moderate energy restriction in rats fed equivalent amounts of protein also lowered the transthyretin level. Rats with similar body weights and similar protein intakes showed marked differences in serum transthyretin level, depending on the amount of energy consumed. Serum transthyretin changes were discussed in relation to the level of transthyretin in cerebrospinal fluid and to the serum concentration of albumin, transferrin and thyroid hormones. The results show that serum transthyretin is more closely related to the protein and energy intakes than to the protein and energy content of the diet. Our results indicate that serum transthyretin measurement is a reliable marker in the detection of early moderate and severe protein-energy restriction.\r"

Kinetic variables were estimated by compartmental analysis of blood metabolite and expired CO2 specific activity values obtained during infusion of [U-14C]glucose or [1-14C]palmitate. With bST treatment, milk energy yield increased by 31% but feed intake was unchanged. Blood glucose concentrations were not affected by treatment or correlated with any glucose kinetic variables. In the control period, glucose ILR was 12.1 mol/d with 66.5% utilized for milk lactose synthesis and 17.4% oxidized to CO2. Treatment with bST increased glucose ILR (+1.5 mol/d) and reduced glucose oxidation (-0.4 mol/d); this accommodated the additional glucose (+1.3 mol/d) required for the increase in lactose secretion. Increases in milk energy yield with bST treatment caused cows to be in a substantial negative net energy balance (-9.8 Mcal/d). No acute lipolytic response occurred with bST treatment, but plasma NEFA were chronically elevated (+104 mumol/L) and NEFA ILR increased (+2.3 mol/d). Increased NEFA turnover was primarily used for increased oxidation to CO2 (+0.5 mol/d) and 41% increase in milk fat (equal to approximately 1.3 mol fatty acids/d). For NEFA, plasma concentrations were correlated with ILR (r = +0.80), oxidation to CO2 (r = +0.74) and net energy balance (r = -0.78). Overall, bST resulted in an exquisite coordination of metabolism to meet nutrient needs for increased synthesis of milk components.\r"

Both hypervitaminotic conditions were characterized by hepatic lipid accumulation. Golgi apparatus fractions were isolated and purity of the fractions was monitored by marker-enzyme analyses and electron microscopy. The quality of the fractions isolated from livers of rats receiving vitamin A excess was not different from that of fractions from control rats. An increase in fat-storing cells in liver, observed in vitamin A excess, coincided with the presence of a floating lipid layer present during isolation of the Golgi apparatus. Galactosyltransferase specific activity (with ovomucoid as acceptor) of Golgi apparatus of rats fed excess vitamin A was 27% of control with chronic feeding and 59% of control with administration by gavage. Activity of another luminally oriented protein, uridine 5'-diphosphate phosphatase, was increased under both in vivo regimens. Vitamin A content of Golgi apparatus, as determined by high performance liquid chromatography, correlated negatively with galactosyltransferase activity after both chronic and acute administration of excess vitamin A.\r"

Cost effectiveness of a given strategy was found to depend on the sequence in which the tests were performed, but to be relatively independent of the exact cost of the tests. Auscultation for a systolic/diastolic abdominal bruit was the most cost-effective test for beginning a diagnostic strategy and showed a 99.6% specificity for stenosis. When the patient has a systolic bruit only or no bruit, plasma renin activity measurement should guide the clinician's choice of whether to test further with intravenous pyelography or renal arteriography. Diagnosis of renal artery stenosis using these tests is estimated to cost between $2,300 and $6,200 per stenosis found, depending on the prevalence of renal artery stenosis.\r"

In the current study, the effects of neonatal sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine were examined on renal biochemical and functional development. The completeness and persistence of sympathetic nerve loss were confirmed by direct measurement of norepinephrine levels and turnover. Evidence was obtained for adverse effects on cellular maturation, as shown by perturbations in the ornithine decarboxylase/polyamine system, which is controlled partially by beta adrenergic input and which regulates macromolecule synthesis in developing cells. A later phase of 6-hydroxydopamine-induced alterations in renal development was seen during the period in which synaptogenesis is prominent and sympathetic tone is high (end of the 2nd postnatal week to end of the 3rd week): the denervated kidneys displayed supersensitivity of beta adrenergically mediated cyclic AMP responses without changes in receptor binding. The alterations in biochemical indices of cellular maturation were accompanied by abnormalities of renal function. 6-Hydroxydopamine caused an increase in the fractional excretion of sodium and deficits in physiological responsiveness of the kidney to a vasopressin analog. Later on, alterations in glomerular filtration rate and basal urinary osmolality also were prominent. These results indicate that neonatal sympathectomy has an adverse effect on the biochemical and functional development of the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "Our previous studies have demonstrated: 1) that i.v. quinpirole (LY171555), a selective dopamine D2 receptor agonist, has a dose-dependent pressor effect in conscious rats which is mediated by activation of sympathetic outflow and vasopressinergic activity, and 2) that the activity of central dopaminergic neurons is reduced in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)/NaCl hypertensive rats. To elucidate the role of central and peripheral dopaminergic systems in the pathogenesis of DOCA/NaCl hypertension, we examined the effects of quinpirole on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine, arginine vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in conscious 4-week-old DOCA/NaCl hypertensive and normotensive control rats. Quinpirole (1 mg/kg i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure in both groups, but the pressor response was attenuated in DOCA/NaCl rats. Paradoxically, quinpirole-induced increments in plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and arginine vasopressin were greater in DOCA/NaCl rats. In addition, quinpirole induced a 2-fold increase in plasma ANP (P less than .01) in both DOCA/NaCl and control rats. Pretreatment with domperidone (2.5 mg/kg i.v.), a peripherally acting dopamine D2 antagonist, enhanced the maximum pressor response to quinpirole in both groups, restored the quinpirole-induced pressor response to control levels in the DOCA/NaCl rats and blocked the stimulatory effect of quinpirole on ANP release in both groups. These data indicate that peripheral dopamine D2 receptors modulate ANP secretion in the rat. The observation that the quinpirole-induced increment in plasma ANP was enhanced in DOCA/NaCl rats supports the hypothesis that the blunted pressor response to quinpirole in this model is related to enhanced ANP release.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between morphine [i.p. and intrathecal (i.t.)] and calcium and its antagonists (i.t. and i.c.v.) was studied in the mouse tail-flick test for antinociception. Calcium (0.66 mumol i.t.) produced antinociception comparable to that of morphine (0.5 microgram i.t.) but had a significantly longer duration. A lower dose of calcium (0.16 mumol i.t.) significantly potentiated morphine (0.2 and 0.5 micrograms i.t.). The antinociceptive effect of i.p. morphine was also potentiated by i.t. calcium, but was antagonized by the i.t. administration of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (3.7-7.5 nmol), verapamil (15 micrograms), magnesium (9.4 nmol) and barium (1-2 nmol). In contrast, i.t. calcium and i.p. morphine were significantly potentiated by the i.c.v. administration of verapamil (15 micrograms) and antagonized by i.c.v. calcium (0.33 mumol). The antinociceptive effect of i.t. calcium was antagonized by naloxone administered s.c. (1 mg/kg) or i.c.v. (0.5 microgram), but not i.t. (0.5 and 10 microgram). It is concluded that the antinociceptive effect of i.t. calcium is mediated, at least partly, by a reflex supraspinal release of endogenous opioids, and that the administration of calcium and its antagonists modify the antinociceptive effect of morphine in opposite directions, depending upon whether they are administered by the i.t. or i.c.v. routes. Calcium may serve as a useful adjunct for opioid-induced analgesia via the i.t. route.\r"

Although ANP relaxes in vitro preparations of smooth muscle and exerts profound effects on renal hemodynamics, the effects of ANP on resistance vessels remain a subject of controversy. In the present study, we utilized an in vitro perfused hydronephrotic rat kidney model to assess directly the actions of ANP on renal microvessels during norepinephrine (NE)-induced renal vasoconstriction. Perfusion pressure was maintained constant, and perfusate flow to the kidney was monitored while the afferent arteriole (AA) and efferent arteriole (EA) were visualized using videomicroscopy. Renal AA and EA diameters were measured by computer-assisted image analysis. NE (0.3 microM) decreased renal perfusate flow from 11.8 +/- 1.7 (S.E.) to 5.8 +/- 1.2 ml/min (P less than .005), decreased AA diameter from 20.2 +/- 0.7 to 14.3 +/- 0.8 mu (P less than .005) and decreased EA diameter from 18.6 +/- 1.2 to 15.1 +/- 1.2 mu (P less than .005). ANP (human ANF-(4-28), anaritide, Wyeth) completely reversed the NE-induced AA vasoconstriction with an IC50 of 9.3 +/- 5.6 nM. In contrast, ANP caused a further decrease in EA diameter at concentrations up to 10(-8) M, and elicited a slight dilation of the EA at 10(-7) M. In normal rat kidneys perfused under identical conditions, NE decreased renal perfusate flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction. ANP increased glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction above control levels, with maximal effects at 10(-8) M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Previous studies had demonstrated that the antihistamine pyrilamine and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin inhibited the C5a-induced bronchoconstriction but the leukotriene (LT)D4 antagonist L-649,923 did not. As an extension of those studies, the purpose of the present study was to determine the contribution of specific cyclooxygenase products and/or LTB4 in mediating C5a-induced bronchoconstriction. To assess the role of the various potential mediators, plasma levels of thromboxane (TX)B2, prostaglandin (PG)D2 and PGF2 alpha were monitored. In addition, guinea pigs were treated either with the TX synthetase inhibitor U-63557A, treated with the TX receptor antagonist SQ 29,548 or made tachyphylactic to the bronchoconstrictor actions of LTB4. C5a challenge caused an increase in plasma concentrations of TXB2, which peaked before the maximum of the bronchoconstriction. However, no significant increase in plasma concentrations of PGD2 or PGF2 alpha was seen. Both U-63557A at 80 mg/kg and SQ 29,548 significantly inhibited the C5a-induced bronchoconstriction, whereas 10 mg/kg of U-63557A did not. The inability of 10 mg/kg of U-63557A to inhibit the response could be explained by both incomplete inhibition of TX synthesis as well as possibly by the increased plasma concentrations of the potent bronchoconstrictor PGD2, which occurred with C5a challenge in the presence of U-63557A. In animals tachyphylactic to LTB4, the maximum of the C5a-induced bronchoconstriction was no different from control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ethanol (5-100 mM) potentiated the effect of GABA on 36Cl-influx; whereas at concentrations greater than or equal to 50 mM ethanol activated Cl- channels directly. The effect of ethanol was specific for GABAA receptor-gated Cl- channels, as ethanol did not potentiate glycine-induced 36Cl-influx in the same neurons. Both the enhancing and direct effects of ethanol on 36Cl-influx were blocked by GABA antagonists like bicuculline, picrotoxinin and inverse agonists of the benzodiazepine site like the imidazodiazepine R015-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5 alpha], [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142). Ethanol potentiating effect of GABA-induced 36Cl-influx was also reversed by methyl-6,7-dimethyl-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. The effects of the inverse agonists were blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist R015-1788. Both R015-4513 and FG-7142 reversed direct and GABA potentiating effects of ethanol effect at concentrations lower than those that exhibit inverse agonistic activity in the 36Cl-influx assay in cultured neurons. These results suggest that ethanol facilitation of GABAAergic transmission involves GABA receptor-gated Cl- channels and that this interaction may be responsible for some of the pharmacological effects of ethanol.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of bradykinin-induced contraction in rabbit urinary detrusor was investigated using an anti-inflammatory drug, tiaramide. The contraction as well as prostaglandin (PG) E2 release induced by bradykinin was abolished by treatment with indomethacin, indicating that the contraction was mediated by PGs. The accumulation of inositol phosphates (IP) by bradykinin was partly inhibited by treatment with indomethacin, suggesting that part of the IP accumulation was due to PGs. Although the remaining accumulation of IPs induced by bradykinin in the presence of indomethacin should elicit contraction in smooth muscle cells, indomethacin abolished bradykinin-induced contraction. The dissociation between indomethacin-induced inhibition of IP accumulation and contraction induced by bradykinin might be explained by the existence of PG-generating cells in addition to smooth muscle cells. Bradykinin stimulates phospholipase C, which leads to an increase in intracellular free Ca++, activation of phospholipase A2 and release of PGs in the PG-generating cells. The released PGs act on smooth muscle cells to elicit contractions via phospholipase C activation and Ca++ mobilization. Tiaramide inhibited the PGE2 release and contraction induced by bradykinin by reducing the arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipid but did not have a direct effect on cyclo-oxygenase. Tiaramide reduced IP accumulation induced by bradykinin to an extent similar to indomethacin. However, tiaramide had no effect on IP accumulation induced by PGE2, although it potently inhibited the contraction induced by PGE2, which elicits contractions without affecting phospholipase A2. The rise in intracellular free Ca++ induced by PGE2 as well as bradykinin was inhibited by tiaramide.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present study we investigated the membrane events and the ionic processes which mediate the stimulatory effect of ouabain on the release of endogenous dopamine (DA) and \"previously taken-up\" [3H]DA release from rat hypothalamic tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) neurons. Ouabain (0.1-1 mM) dose-dependently stimulated endogenous DA and \"newly taken-up\" [3H]DA release. This effect was counteracted partially by nomifensine (10 microM). Removal of Ca++ ions from the extracellular space in the presence of the Ca++-chelator ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid prevented completely ouabain-elicited [3H]DA release. Lanthanum (1 mM) and cobalt (2 mM), two inorganic Ca++-entry blockers, were able to inhibit this stimulatory effect, whereas verapamil (10 microM) and nitrendipine (50 microM), two organic antagonists of the voltage-operated channel for Ca++ ions, failed to affect ouabain-induced [3H]DA release. By contrast, adriamycin (100-300 microM), a putative inhibitor of cardiac Na+-Ca++ antiporter, dose-dependently prevented ouabain-induced [3H]DA release from TIDA neurons. Finally, tetrodotoxin reduced digitalis-stimulated [3H]DA release. In conclusion, these results seem to be compatible with the idea that the inhibition of Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase by ouabain stimulates the release of [3H]DA from a central neuronal system like the TIDA tract and that this effect is critically dependent on the entrance of Ca++ ions into the nerve terminals of these neurons. In addition the Na+-Ca++ exchange antiporter appears to be the membrane system which transports Ca++ ions into the neuronal cytoplasm during Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase inhibition. The enhanced intracellular Ca++ availability triggers DA release which could occur partially through a carrier-dependent process.\r"

Amiloride (300 microM) stimulated either endogenous DA or [3H]DA release. Amiloride-induced stimulation of [3H]DA release was prevented in a Ca++-free plus ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid medium. Amiloride, at the same concentration, reinforced both high K+- and electrically-induced stimulation of [3H]DA release. These results are explained on the basis of the ability of amiloride in blocking the Na+-Ca++ exchange system, therefore causing an elevation of intracellular Ca++ levels in resting conditions, and a further accumulation of Ca++ ions after high K+- or electrically elicited opening of voltage-operated channels specific for Ca++ ions. The enhanced intracellular Ca++ availability may trigger the stimulation of neurotransmitter release. In addition, amiloride was able to block in a dose-dependent manner (70-300 microM) the ouabain-induced [3H]DA release, suggesting that, when intracellular concentrations of Na+ are increased by the blockade of Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase the Na+-Ca+;+ exchange carrier reverses its resting mode of operation, mediating the influx of extracellular Ca++ ions. Amiloride, by blocking the Na+-Ca++ exchange mechanism, prevents the ouabain-elicited entrance of extracellular Ca++ ions, therefore inhibiting [3H]DA release stimulated by the cardioactive glycoside. Collectively, the results of the present study seem to be compatible with the idea that the Na+-Ca++ exchange mechanism is involved in the regulation of [3H]DA release from tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons, through the regulation of Ca++ movements across the plasma membrane.\r"

The present study investigated whether this behavioral effect is related to activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system. In the first experiment, l-nicotine (0.2-0.8 mg/kg s.c.) stimulated locomotor activity and increased dopamine utilization in the olfactory tubercle, as judged by the ratio of the concentration of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid to dopamine. In other experiments, l-nicotine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) stimulated locomotor activity in a dose-related, stereoselective manner; after pretreatment with the l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015, l-nicotine increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine/dopamine ratios in olfactory tubercle and nucleus accumbens, suggesting increased dopamine utilization, although absolute concentrations of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and dopamine were in general not significantly altered. This neurochemical action of l-nicotine was dose-dependent, stereoselective and absent in the caudate-putamen at the doses tested. l-Nicotine did not alter indices of 5-hydroxytryptamine utilization. The locomotor stimulant effect of l-nicotine was abolished by bilateral intra-accumbens microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine, which depleted markedly mesolimbic terminal areas of dopamine. Thus, in rats which have been chronically treated with l-nicotine, a selective activation of mesolimbic dopamine appears to mediate the locomotor stimulant effect of this drug.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial relaxant responses to beta adrenoceptor agonists are decreased in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) when compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). To determine which component of the beta adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase (AC) system is involved in the decreased beta adrenoceptor responses, effects of two activators of AC-forskolin and cholera toxin and of dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) were compared between the strips of femoral arteries isolated from 13-week-old SHR and age-matched WKY. Arterial relaxant responses to either forskolin, an activator of AC or DBcAMP were not significantly different between the SHR and WKY, whereas the relaxant responses to norepinephrine (NE) via beta adrenoceptors were significantly weaker in the SHR than in the WKY. In the absence of timolol, a beta adrenoceptor antagonist, contractile responses to NE were significantly greater in the SHR than in the WKY. Timolol augmented the contractile responses to NE to a greater extent in the WKY than in the SHR. After the blockade by timolol of beta adrenoceptors, contractile responses to alpha adrenoceptor stimulation with NE were not significantly different between the two strains. The pretreatment of the strips with cholera toxin, an activator of stimulatory GTP-binding protein (Gs), antagonized the alpha adrenoceptor-mediated contractions much greater in the WKY than in the SHR. The alpha adrenoceptor-mediated contractions after the pretreatment with cholera toxin were comparable to the contractile responses to NE determined in the absence of timolol in either the SHR or the WKY. Forskolin and DBcAMP also antagonized the alpha adrenoceptor-mediated contractions. However, these antagonisms were not significantly different between the two strains. The cellular cAMP content in arterial strips after the stimulation with NE was significantly less in the SHR than in the WKY, whereas the cAMP contents were similar in arterial strips from both strains which were stimulated with forskolin. These results suggest that the reduced function of Gs is involved in the abnormality of beta adrenoceptor-AC system in the SHR femoral artery.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of pertussis toxin treatment on the characteristics of somatostatin receptors in the anterior pituitary tumor cell line AtT-20 were examined. Pertussis toxin selectively catalyzed the ADP ribosylation of the alpha subunits of the inhibitory GTP binding proteins in AtT-20 cells. Toxin treatment abolished somatostatin inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and somatostatin stimulation of GTPase activity. To examine the effects of pertussis toxin treatment on the characteristics of the somatostatin receptor, the receptor was labeled by the somatostatin analog [125I]CGP 23996. [125I]CGP 23996 binding to AtT-20 cell membranes was saturable and within a limited concentration range was to a single high affinity site. Pertussis toxin treatment reduced the apparent density of the high affinity [125I]CGP 23996 binding sites in AtT-20 cell membranes. Inhibition of [125I]CGP 23996 binding by a wide concentration range of CGP 23996 revealed the presence of two binding sites. GTP predominantly reduced the level of high affinity sites in control membranes. Pertussis toxin treatment also diminished the amount of high affinity sites. GTP did not affect [125I]CGP 23996 binding in the pertussis toxin-treated membranes. The high affinity somatostatin receptors were covalently labeled with [125I] CGP 23996 and the photoactivated crosslinking agent n-hydroxysuccinimidyl-4-azidobenzoate. No high affinity somatostatin receptors, covalently bound to [125I]CGP 23996, were detected in the pertussis toxin-treated membranes. These results are most consistent with pertussis toxin uncoupling the inhibitory G proteins from the somatostatin receptor thereby converting the receptor from a mixed population of high and low affinity sites to only low affinity receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to examine the potential beneficial effect of the selective endoperoxide/thromboxane A2 (TxA2) receptor antagonist, sulotroban (BM 13.177), on tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced coronary thrombolysis in the dog. A stenosis that eliminated reactive hyperemic capacity was placed on the circumflex coronary artery and an occlusive thrombus was produced by electrical injury to the intimal surface of the artery. Upon occlusion, sodium heparin was administered (300 U/kg i.v.) followed by 100 U/kg i.v. every hour thereafter. All dogs received i.v. tPA 60 min after the formation of the occlusive thrombus at a dose of 10 micrograms/kg/min for up to 90 min, if necessary, to elicit reperfusion. Thrombolysis was demonstrated in all dogs by restoration of coronary blood flow. Dogs were randomized to one of three groups. Group I consisted of 24 animals that received vehicle infusion along with tPA. Group II consisted of 10 animals that received sulotroban at a bolus dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. followed by 1 mg/kg/hr i.v. administered simultaneously with tPA. Group III consisted of 11 animals that received sulotroban at a bolus of 10 mg/kg i.v. followed by 10 mg/kg/hr i.v. administered simultaneously with tPA. Infusions of either vehicle or sulotroban were continued for 2 hr, post-thrombolysis. tPA was infused for at least 30 min, after which infusion of tPA was terminated upon achieving a reperfusion level of coronary blood flow equivalent to 50% or greater than control blood flow. All animals occluded spontaneously to electrolytic stimulation between 32 and 62 min. tPA-induced thrombolysis occurred in Group I vehicle-infused animals at 32 +/- 5 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The onset of infection is associated with increases in renal blood flow and sodium excretion. Our studies provide evidence that the natriuresis is mediated by stimulation of renal prostaglandin production by the cytokine, interleukin-1. A dose-dependent natriuresis and diuresis was elicited in conscious rats with bolus intravenous injections of human recombinant interleukin-1-beta (hrIL-1). Injection of 1.5, 3 and 24 micrograms hrIL-1 increased sodium excretion by 2.4 +/- 0.9 microEq/min, 4.0 +/- 0.8 microEq/min and 5.4 +/- 0.3 microEq/min, respectively. The natriuresis was preceded by a corresponding increase in urinary PGE excretion (80%, 110% and 296%, respectively). The natriuresis elicited by 3 micrograms hrIL-1 was independent of changes in glomerular filtration rate or effective renal plasma flow. IL-1 induced an increase in rectal temperature, (0.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C) and a modest increase in mean arterial pressure (12 +/- 3 mm Hg) within 10 minutes of injection. However, during the period of maximal natriuresis (40 to 100 min), blood pressure and rectal temperature were not significantly different from control. Pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ibuprofen, significantly attenuated the natriuretic response and indomethacin completely abolished the natriuresis. These results identify IL-1 as a factor which stimulates renal PGE synthesis, and increases sodium excretion, independent of changes in glomerular filtration rate. We propose that IL-1-induced natriuresis may be a component of the overall acute phase response which is actively mounted by the host during infection.\r"

To examine the role of DTH in glomerular fibrin deposition, 10 fibrin-positive and 24 fibrin-negative biopsy specimens from patients with glomerulonephritis (GN) and samples from normal controls were studied with monoclonal antibodies against T cells, macrophages, and HTF. Fibrin-positive sections showed intense glomerular staining for HTF and significantly more T cells and macrophages than fibrin-negative specimens. All the essential elements of DTH reactions can therefore be simultaneously demonstrated within glomeruli from patients with fibrin-related GN. These findings suggest a role for cell mediated immunity in GN.\r"

An acetone precipitate (AP) of M tuberculosis, and a purified protein derivative (PPD) of M tuberculosis were also tested. Responsiveness of synovial fluid lymphocytes to the mycobacterial antigens was found both in patients with RA and in patients with other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis, but not among controls. T cell reactivity against mycobacterial antigens was nearly always higher in synovial fluid than in peripheral blood in those patients who showed reactivity. A significant association was found between responsiveness of synovial T cells to the 65 kD protein and AP, but no relation between responsiveness to the 65 kD protein and PPD. Both the number of 65 kD protein responders and the mean proliferative response of synovial T cells to the 65 kD protein were inversely correlated with duration of joint inflammation. Thus, a 65 kD-protein-specific reactivity of synovial T cells, mainly present in an early stage of joint inflammation, may be responsible for triggering chronic arthritis.\r"

  ".W": "Both the internal mammary artery and the saphenous vein are used to construct coronary-artery bypass grafts. We hypothesized that the release or production of endothelium-derived relaxing factor, which regulates blood flow and inhibits platelet function, may differ in venous and arterial grafts. We therefore studied endothelium-dependent relaxation in internal mammary arteries, internal mammary veins, and saphenous veins obtained from 58 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. Vascular rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers, and isometric tension was recorded. Acetylcholine (10(-8) to 10(-4) M), thrombin (1 U per milliliter), and adenosine diphosphate (10(-7) to 10(-4) M) evoked potent endothelium-dependent relaxation in the mammary artery but weak response in the saphenous vein (P less than 0.005; n = 6 to 27). In the mammary artery, relaxation was greatest in response to acetylcholine (86 +/- 4 percent reduction in norepinephrine-induced tension), followed by thrombin (44 +/- 7 percent) and adenosine diphosphate (39 +/- 8 percent). In the saphenous and mammary veins, relaxation was less than 25 percent. Relaxation was unaffected by indomethacin but was inhibited by methylene blue and hemoglobin (P less than 0.005 and 0.01, respectively), which suggests that endothelium-derived relaxing factor was the mediator. Endothelium-independent relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside was similar in arteries and veins. We conclude that endothelium-dependent relaxation is greater in the mammary artery than in the saphenous vein. The possibility that this contributes to the higher patency rate among arterial grafts than among venous grafts will require further study.\r"

The results were related to metabolic control and to clinical, neuropathological, and morphometric abnormalities in the nerves. The mean endoneurial glucose, fructose, and sorbitol values were higher in diabetic patients than in controls. Linear regression analysis revealed that nerve sorbitol content in the diabetics was inversely related to the number of myelinated fibers (P = 0.003). Mean nerve levels of myo-inositol were not decreased in the diabetic patients, with or without neuropathy, and were not associated with any of the neuropathological end points of diabetes. Our results indicate that myo-inositol deficiency is not part of the pathogenesis of human diabetic neuropathy, as had been hypothesized. Other accumulated alcohol sugars, however, were increased in diabetes and were associated with the severity of neuropathy. On repeat biopsy, six diabetics, treated for a year with the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil, had decreased endoneurial levels of sorbitol (P less than 0.01) and fructose (0.05 less than P less than 0.1), but unchanged levels of myo-inositol.\r"

  ".W": "There is reason to believe that diabetic neuropathy may be related to the accumulation of sorbitol in nerve tissue through an aldose reductase pathway from glucose. Short-term treatment with aldose reductase inhibitors improves nerve conduction in subjects with diabetes, but the effects of long-term treatment on the neuropathologic changes of diabetic neuropathy are unknown. To determine whether more prolonged aldose reductase inhibition reverses the underlying lesions that accompany symptomatic diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, we performed a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of the investigational aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil (250 mg per day). Sural-nerve biopsy specimens obtained at base line and after one year from 16 diabetic patients with neuropathy were analyzed morphometrically in detail and compared with selected electrophysiologic and clinical indexes. In contrast to patients who received placebo, the 10 sorbinil-treated patients had a decrease of 41.8 +/- 8.0 percent in nerve sorbitol content (P less than 0.01) and a 3.8-fold increase in the percentage of regenerating myelinated nerve fibers (P less than 0.001), reflected by a 33 percent increase in the number of myelinated fibers per unit of cross-sectional area of nerve (P = 0.04). They also had quantitative improvement in terms of the degree of paranodal demyelination, segmental demyelination, and myelin wrinkling. The increase in the number of fibers was accompanied by electrophysiologic and clinical evidence of improved nerve function. We conclude that sorbinil, as a metabolic intervention targeted against a specific biochemical consequence of hyperglycemia, can improve the neuropathologic lesions of diabetic neuropathy.\r"

Here I argue from such a study that the active site sequences of enzymes that have analogous essential serine residues lie in fact on two lines of descent from an ancient ancestral enzyme which had a cysteine instead of serine in its active site. This is based on the assumption that the two codon types which define the separate lines of descent and which have different bases in two positions could not interconvert by single mutations.\r"

  ".W": "Before quiescent cells can respond to mitogens and progress through the G1 phase of cell growth, new messenger RNA synthesis is required. The G1 phase seems to be a critical point of control in the cell cycle, where normal cells deprived of growth factors halt cycling while transformed cells do not, suggesting that regulatory genes, uncontrolled in the neoplastic phenotype, are expressed during the G0 to G1 transition. Some of these may code for nuclear proteins that participate in the transactivation of genes required for the progression through G1. The observed changes in expression of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc, following stimulation of fibroblasts with growth factors, support this notion as recent evidence suggests that c-FOS and c-MYC proteins can function as transactivating factors. Moreover, the rapid induction of several genes in fibroblasts coding for putative transacting factors during the G0 to G1 transition has been recently reported. Here we present the nucleotide sequence of a mouse cDNA clone coding for a 334 residue protein which shows 80% similarity with v-JUN and more than 98% similarity with the human c-JUN sequence. We have demonstrated that in quiescent fibroblasts c-jun transcription is rapidly induced during the G0 to G1 transition.\r"

Others, like the rat transin gene, are activated more slowly but more durably and their activation requires prior protein synthesis. It is tempting to speculate that certain rapidly-activated genes code for transcription factors which interact directly with promoter regions of genes like the transin gene to trigger their expression. Unfortunately, little is known about the majority of primary response genes to support this hypothesis. The proto-oncogene c-jun codes for the transcription factor AP-1 or a closely related protein. We show that epidermal growth factor stimulates transcription of the c-jun gene in fibroblasts as a primary response. This supports the notion that increased expression of genes encoding transcription factors is an important element of the signal transduction mechanism, assuring the long-term transcriptional response of cells to growth factors.\r"

If no major toxicity was encountered, the weekly dose was escalated 5 mg/m2 at three-week intervals until a maximum dose of 50 mg/m2 each week was achieved. Complete response was defined as three normal beta-hCG values measured on consecutive weeks. Fifty-one of 63 evaluable patients (81%) had a complete response to weekly IM methotrexate. Duration of therapy ranged from three to 19 weeks, with a median of seven. No major toxicity occurred. Thirteen patients experienced leukopenia at a median of 3300/microL, with a range of 2300-3900. Three patients had platelet nadirs of 66,000, 127,000, and 135,000/microL. Eleven patients with weekly IM methotrexate failure had a complete response after one to eight courses of dactinomycin administered 0.5 mg/m2 intravenously daily for five days; one refused therapy after three courses.

In this study, biopsy specimens of intraoral Kaposi's sarcoma from 10 patients with AIDS were studied by light and electron microscopic examination and by immunoperoxidase staining with the endothelial markers, factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europeaus agglutinin I. The results of this study support a vascular origin for both the endothelium-lined vessels and the spindle cells.

  ".W": "The acute phase of oxygen-induced retinopathy is associated with vasoconstriction and occlusion of the retinal vessels. Because this acute vasoobliterative phase could be due to the inhibition in retinal vessels of the production of the potent vasodilator and antithrombotic metabolite prostacyclin, animal experiments were performed to assess this possibility. Eight litters of 27 kittens (four to six days of age) were used. Control kittens were left in room air; hyperoxic kittens were placed in 80% oxygen for 48 hours; recovery kittens were returned to room air for 24 hours following hyperoxic exposure. Following treatments, the animals were killed, retinas isolated, and prostaglandin formation assessed. Retinal tissues produced 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, prostaglandin F2 alpha, prostaglandin E2, and thromboxane B2 from exogenous arachidonate. A significant (approximately 33%) reduction in retinal 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (the end product of prostacyclin) was observed both in the hyperoxic and recovery litter mates when compared with controls. Both of the experimental groups also demonstrated a reduction in total retinal prostanoids that paralleled the changes observed in prostacyclin, suggesting that the biochemical effect of hyperoxia on retinal vascular arachidonic acid metabolism occurred at the level of cyclooxygenase. A decrease in the local production of prostacyclin during hyperoxia is consistent with the histologic retinal changes observed during the acute phase of oxygen-induced retinopathy.\r"

  ".W": "According to the new federal diagnosis-related group (DRG) system, hospitals are reimbursed fixed sums based on discharge diagnoses, rather than variable sums that depend on specific goods and services consumed and number of days hospitalized. The government is now exploring DRGs as a potential mechanism for reimbursing physicians. In Florida, two DRG-type reimbursement systems were developed for neonatal and obstetrical hospitalizations in tertiary care settings, as departures from the federal DRG system. Called neonatal care groups (NCGs) and obstetrical care groups (OBCGs), both classification systems predicted hospital charges in these settings more accurately than did federal DRGs. The feasibility of a prospective pricing system for neonatologists and obstetricians based on NCGs and OBCGs was investigated. The data showed that neonatologists' charges had a high correlation with hospital charges (r = .90) and that increasing levels of intensity of care as defined by the NCGs were reflected by consistent increases in reimbursement to neonatologists. If the NCG system were to be applied, neonatologists would receive compensation equivalent to that which they currently earn according to the fee-for-service system. In contrast, obstetricians' charges bore almost no relationship to hospital charges. However, modest differences in obstetrician's charges did emerge as a reflection of number of complications, which are incorporated into the OBCG categories; this suggests that a reimbursement system based on hospital OBCG categories might be applied to obstetricians.\r"

  ".W": "In 1980, the Department of Health and Human Services set national prevention objectives for 1990 in 15 health priority areas, 1 of which is the control of toxic agents and radiation. Ten objectives related to this area are priorities for the national control effort. Progress is reviewed on those priorities within the responsibilities of the Public Health Service. Six key program elements, or types of support activities, are deemed essential to preventing, identifying, and controlling toxic agent and radiation threats. Significant progress has been made toward achieving objectives for which all key program elements have been successfully implemented to provide the requisite know-how, manpower, and tools. Important advances have been made in reducing the blood lead levels of the population, reducing unnecessary exposure to medical X-rays, evaluating the toxicities of chemicals in toxic waste dumps, and improving the scientific and technical information base and its availability for prevention and control efforts. The most important priority for the forseeable future will be to expand our knowledge of potential health risks posed by toxic agents and radiation. Expanded surveillance systems and data bases are essential to determining the extent of the problems in terms of human health effects and for measuring the impact of prevention programs. Emphasis on the activities embodied in the key elements will encourage the expansion of the knowledge base and its effective application to prevention and control problems.\r"

The effectiveness of condoms in disease prophylaxis is dependent, to a degree, on their correct use. Condom manufacturers routinely include information on condom use either printed on the actual package or in an enclosed package insert. With the use of three readability formulas, the reading grade level was determined for 14 different sets of instructions included with 25 brands of condoms manufactured by 7 domestic and 1 overseas manufacturer. The readability formulas, when applied to instructions for condom use, estimated that, conservatively, 8 of the 14 instructions required at least reading at the level of a high school graduate and none required less than a 10th grade level. Clearly written instructions and simple concepts could assist current and future condom users in the correct use of condoms and improve the effectiveness of condoms in the prevention of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.\r"

  ".W": "The Minnesota Heart Health Program (MHHP) aims to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality by reducing risk factors among the mass of residents in three midwestern communities. A major aspect of the program is the involvement of community physicians because they have high credibility as citizen leaders, especially on health issues. In the MHHP, physicians contributed in a number of ways. The initial contacts with physicians resulted in their providing support and introductions to other community leaders, whose active support was also gained. Physicians sit as members of the central Community Advisory Borads of MHHP and serve on the executive committees of these boards. All MHHP issues related to medical practice are brought before Physicians' Advisory Groups in each community for resolution. Primary care physicians attend MHHP continuing education programs. In a survey of 109 physicians in one of the MHHP communities, 95 percent of respondents believed cigarette smoking to be an important risk factor for CVD, but only 15 percent judged themselves to be effective in dealing with patients who smoked. Forty-one percent of respondents said that elevated blood cholesterol is an important risk factor, but only 20 percent felt effective in treating the condition. Only 18 percent of the physicians in the sample believed that a poor eating pattern plays a substantial role in CVD, and 9 percent felt effective in counseling patients about eating habits. This pattern of results indicates the need not only for continuing education about risk factors for CVD, but also for training to improve patient counseling skills.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1981, the Centers for Disease Control has collaborated with State health departments and the District of Columbia to conduct random digit-dialed telephone surveys of adults concerning their health practices and behaviors. This State-based surveillance system, which yields data needed in planning, initiating, and supporting health promotion and disease prevention programs, is described in this paper. Standard methods and questionnaires were used to assess the prevalence of personal health practices and behaviors related to the leading causes of death, including seatbelt use, high blood pressure control, physical activity, weight control, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, drinking and driving, and preventive health practices. Between 1981 and 1983, 29 States (includes the District of Columbia) conducted one-time telephone surveys. Beginning in 1984, most States began collecting data continuously throughout the year, completing approximately 100 interviews per month (range 50-250), with an average of 1,200 completed interviews per year (range 600-3,000). The raw data were weighted to the age, race, and sex distribution for each State from the 1980 census data. This weighting accounts for the underrepresentation of men, whites, and younger persons (18-24 years) in the telephone surveys and, for many health practices, provides prevalence estimates comparable with estimates obtained from household surveys. Nearly all (86 percent) of the States distributed selected survey results to other State agencies, local health departments, voluntary organizations, hospitals, universities, State legislators, and the press. The majority (60 percent) of States used information from the surveys to set State health objectives, prepare State health planning documents, and plan a variety of programs concerning antismoking, the prevention of chronic diseases, and health promotion. Further, nearly two-thirds (65 percent) used results to support legislation, primarily related to the use of tobacco and seatbelts. Most of the States (84 percent) reported that alternative sources for such data (prevalence of behavioral risk factors) were unavailable. Currently in 1988, over 40 State health departments are conducting telephone surveys as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This system has proved to be (a) flexible--it provides data on emerging public health problems, such as smokeless tobacco use and AIDS, (b) timely--it provides results within a few months after the data are collected, and (c) affordable--it operates at a fraction of the cost of comparable statewide in-person surveys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Health promotion-disease prevention programs share with health behavior research the common objective of identifying population subgroups toward whom services can be targeted. For this report, six age-sex groups were examined to determine similarities and differences in the predictors of eight health practice indices. Data were from the 1979 National Survey of Personal Health Practices and Consequences. Results showed very little similarity of predictors across the three age cohorts (20-34, 35-49, 50-64), between men and women, and among the six age-sex groups. No predictor achieved significance consistently for several health practices in any of the six groups, although years of education made the best showing. The lack of overlap among predictors helps to explain why health promotion messages and recruitment strategies may not appeal to as diverse an audience as initially intended. Possible explanations for the absence of similar predictors include differences in the nature of the various practices themselves, absence of data on intentions behind a person's behavior, and the \"over-determined\" character of an individual person's behavior.\r"

Special attention is given to Mexican Americans, a group that until recently has received scant attention in comparative research on smoking. In general, we find that ethnic differences in smoking vary across several dimensions. Many Mexican American females never smoke. If they do, they begin smoking late, smoke few cigarettes per day, and are likely to quit. Although many anglo (non-Hispanic white) males and females have tried smoking, a much higher proportion of males have quit. Blacks generally display rates intermediate to Mexican Americans and anglos, with relatively low rates of cigarette consumption. Discussed in this report are potential mortality effects, possible intervention strategies, and possible directions for future research.\r"

Data were from a general health survey of all eighth grade students enrolled in public schools in two rural Maryland counties. A total of 745 students completed a self-administered questionnaire during school hours in January 1984. Information was obtained on a variety of sociodemographic characteristics and on the students' use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Correlational analyses were used to examine the relationships among cigarette smoking, beer or wine drinking, whiskey or hard liquor drinking, and marijuana use. Logistic regression was used to model the effects of drug use behaviors on the likelihood of being absent from school 3 or more days, adjusting for the student's age, sex, race, parents' education, illness frequency, and concerns about learning problems in school. We found substantial covariation among the use of cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. After adjusting for the background variables of illness, frequency, and learning problems, we found that students who are frequent cigarette smokers experienced a 2.6 risk of school absenteeism. Other drug use behaviors were not associated significantly with increased risk of missing school. Findings are discussed within the context of health-related consequences of drug use.\r"

  ".W": "Injuries and violence are the primary causes of death among young children in the United States. In particular, in 1982-84 motor vehicle injuries, fires, drowning, and homicide were the leading external causes of death at ages 1-4 years and 5-9 years, accounting for nearly 80 percent of all deaths from external causes. The purpose of this article is to analyze race and sex differentials in injury fatalities among young children. Race and sex differentials in injury mortality were measured in terms of relative risks, that is, race (black to white) and sex (male to female) mortality ratios. Race ratios for external causes ranged from 1.7 to 1.9 for children 1-4 and 5-9, while sex ratios were somewhat lower, 1.4 to 1.8. Although race and sex ratios were relatively small for passenger-related motor vehicle fatalities (0.8 to 1.2) the ratios for pedestrian-related injuries were considerably greater (1.5 to 2.0). Race ratios for deaths caused by fires and homicide were particularly large (3.4 to 4.3). Mortality differences were also measured in terms of excess mortality. For each age-race group more than 65 percent of the overall excess deaths among males were due to external causes of death. Pedestrian-related motor vehicle injuries and drownings accounted for the largest proportion of excess deaths among males. At ages 1-4, 53 percent of the overall excess deaths among blacks were due to external causes. Deaths caused by fires and homicide accounted for more than two-fifths of the excess in this age group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The data suggest that many drownings are preventable, and reinforce the etiologic importance of ethanol consumption in such deaths. The overall drowning rate for North Carolina residents during the period covered by the study was 3.2 per 100,000 persons. Nonwhite males had the highest rate, 8.8 per 100,000 population. The next highest rate was for white males, 4.7 per 100,000. Swimming and wading, involved in 41 percent of the drowning deaths, was the most frequently associated activity. Fishing was involved in 15 percent of the deaths, and motor vehicle accidents with 8 percent. Most occurred in freshwater settings, notably lakes and ponds, 39 percent, and rivers and creeks, 29 percent. Of the 752 victims 15 years and older tested for blood ethanol, 53 percent had positive tests and 38 percent had blood alcohol concentrations of 100 milligrams per deciliter or greater. Significant percentages of victims 15 years and older with blood alcohol concentrations greater than 100 milligrams per deciliter were found in all settings and activity groups.\r"

The cost of health care, particularly medical specialty care, was defrayed in large part by private insurance and public programs, such as Medicaid and Title V Programs for children with special health care needs, while financial support for related services, such as physical therapy and speech therapy, came largely through the schools. Compared to funding for health and related services, financial aid for community-based family support services is largely lacking.\r"

After that survey, three measures were taken in an effort to improve reporting and surveillance: (a) use of a stamped self-addressed CMR postcard, (b) publication of the monthly newsletter \"Public Health Letter,\" which was distributed to 23,000 health professionals in Los Angeles County free of charge, and (c) initiation of an active disease surveillance system that included 171 reporting sites contacted weekly (76 physicians, 36 schools, 33 preschools, 22 hospitals, and 4 university student health centers). No increase in the levels of disease reporting was observed, based on 4 years' experience with the revised CMR card and the Public Health Letter. The active disease surveillance system, however, has provided anecdotal reports of disease occurrence and notification of outbreaks of both reportable and nonreportable diseases. Moreover, the authors believe it has improved rapport between the county health department and the medical community.\r"

Presented in this paper is an analysis of a Chicago public health clinic's special program for adolescents that originated from the staff's observations of the scheduling, educational, and support needs of teens seeking family planning services from a traditionally managed public health facility. Between December 1982, when the special program--the Teen Clinic--was implemented, and March 1985, more than 600 adolescents sought social support and contraceptive services--an 82 percent increase in new-patient registration compared with the enrollment before the program began. In contrast, two neighboring public health department facilities without special family planning programs for teens experienced either a small increase, 4 percent, or a modest decrease, 17 percent, in utilization by teenagers during the same period. The increased use of the study facility by teens, coupled with patients' self-reported nonuse of alternative sources of care and referral patterns, suggests that the new program was successful in recruiting sexually active teens who had previously been inadequately protected against pregnancy. The perceived institutional and interpersonal factors influencing 153 teens' initial and repeated use of the Teen Clinic, as measured by a structured survey, echo the findings of previous research. Strategies suggested by the study's findings for improving outreach and service delivery are described.\r"

Images of 3FD-glucose showed significant 3FD-glucose uptake by adipose tissue, indicating its buffering effects in case of excess loads of glucose. Images of 3-fluoro-3-deoxy-D-sorbitol (3FD-sorbitol) demonstrated the spatial distribution of aldose reductase activities and significant sorbitol accumulation in the lens.

  ".W": "From 1981 to 1986, 23 patients (24 hips) were treated with single-dose irradiation after hip surgery in an attempt to prevent heterotopic bone formation. All patients were at high risk for the development of heterotopic ossification because of the presence of heterotopic bone in either hip secondary to trauma or previous surgery, ankylosing spondylitis, or hypertrophic osteoarthritis. Thirteen patients (14 hips) underwent primary total-hip arthroplasty, and ten patients underwent revision total-hip arthroplasty or excision of heterotopic bone. The minimum follow-up period was 6 months. All patients were treated by means of a linear accelerator with a single dose of 700 cGy, calculated at midplane. Almost all treatments were given within 72 hours after surgery. Recurrent disease of Brooker grade II type developed in only one (4%) patient. This result is comparable with outcomes reported after fractionated courses of postoperative radiation therapy delivered over a period of 1 or 2 weeks. Postoperative hip irradiation with a single 700-cGy dose appears to be as effective as fractionated courses of radiation in the prevention of heterotopic bone formation in patients at high risk for the development of this complication.\r"

Surgical therapy consisted of total resection in one, subtotal resection in seven, and biopsy only in four. Megavoltage irradiation in the dose range of 3,000-5,600 cGy was employed, with nine patients receiving a dose of at least 5,000 cGy. The local control rate was 67%. The actuarial observed and adjusted 5-year survival rates were 57% and 75%, respectively. These results indicate that postoperative radiation therapy is an effective therapeutic modality in the control of stage III thymoma.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the optimal width of a midline posterior spinal block (MPSB) (to avoid delivering too great a dose to the cord and too small a dose to adjacent tissue), the authors determined with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging normal ranges of cord depth and width and correlated them with film dosimetric data. In 59 randomly selected patients there was a wide range for both depth and width. The average depths of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cord were 6.7 cm +/- 1.4 and 5.4 cm +/- 1.3, respectively. The average cord width was 1.6 cm +/- 0.4. Optimal cord block width as a function of cord width was determined for a 6-MV photon beam. The optimal cord block width at the surface (half-value layer [HVL] thickness = 6) varied from 1.5 to 3.0 cm for cord widths of 0.8-2.4 cm, which correspond to two standard deviations from the average. There was no significant dependence on depth of the cord. For optimal treatment outcome, the MPSB width may have to be determined for each patient individually.\r"

Reconstitution studies have implicated the alpha and beta gamma subunits as mediators, but subunit coupling by the endogenous G protein has not been analyzed. To study this process, a monoclonal antibody (4A) that binds to alpha k but not to beta gamma was applied to the solution bathing an inside-out patch of atrial membrane; the antibody blocked carbachol-activated currents irreversibly. The state of the endogenous Gk determined its susceptibility to block by the antibody. When agonist was absent or when activation by muscarinic stimulation was interrupted by withdrawal of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) in the presence or absence of guanosine diphosphate (GDP), the effects of the antibody did not persist. Thus, monoclonal antibody 4A blocked muscarinic activation of potassium channels by binding to the activated G protein in its holomeric form or by binding to the dissociated alpha subunit.\r"

The molecular basis of receptor-G protein interaction has been examined by using the ability of the G protein from rods (transducin) to cause a conformational change in rhodopsin as an assay. Synthetic peptides corresponding to two regions near the carboxyl terminus of the G protein alpha subunit, Glu311-Val328 and Ile340-Phe350, compete with G protein for interaction with rhodopsin. Amino acid substitution studies show that Cys321 is required for this effect. Ile340-Phe350 and a modified peptide, acetyl-Glu311-Lys329-amide, mimic G protein effects on rhodopsin conformation, showing that these peptides bind to and stabilize the activated conformation of rhodopsin.\r"

Eleven of 18 patients had no inducible tachycardia and 7 patients continued to have inducible tachycardia while receiving flecainide. The effects of flecainide could not be evaluated because of hypotension during intravenous infusion in 1 patient. The main effect of the drug was a selective depression of retrograde conduction over the bypass tract, resulting in abolition of reentry or prolongation of tachycardia cycle length. The electrophysiologic effects of intravenous flecainide were concordant with those of oral flecainide in 5 patients who were studied during both regimens. Fifteen patients were discharged from the hospital on a regimen of flecainide. One patient received concomitant beta-blocking therapy. During an average follow-up of 18.5 months (range 2 to 48), 9 patients remained symptom free. Recurrences were observed in 5 patients, 3 of whom still had inducible tachycardia during electrophysiologic testing. Treatment had to be discontinued in 1 patient because of drug intolerance. Thus, flecainide is likely to be effective and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of at least 50% of patients who present with bypass tract mediated orthodromic reentrant tachycardia.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to assess the clinical efficacy of oral flecainide for the prevention of paroxysmal attacks of atrial fibrillation (AF). Forty patients with frequent, very symptomatic AF were selected for study; 31 had vagally induced AF. All patients were considered to be drug resistant. Each had recurrences of AF despite previous antiarrhythmic therapy that included high doses of amiodarone given alone or in combination with a class IA antiarrhythmic agent. In 6 patients, very high doses of amiodarone were efficacious in the prevention of AF; however, the doses had to be reduced because of adverse effects, which resulted in the recurrence of the arrhythmia. Patients were followed up for a period of 18 months and assessed by both symptom development and Holter monitor recordings. Patients received flecainide at an initial dose of 300 mg/day, which was increased to 400 mg/day in case of failure. If the initial dose was successful, the dose was reduced until the lowest one required to prevent recurrences of the arrhythmia was found. Amiodarone was also reduced or withdrawn whenever possible. The results show that AF in 32 of 40 patients was controlled with flecainide given alone (11 of 32) or in combination with amiodarone (21 of 32). Only 8 patients were considered to be drug resistant. The mean dose required to prevent recurrences of AF was also determined for each drug. The combined administration of flecainide and amiodarone allowed a significant reduction in the daily dose of amiodarone (p less than 0.005). On the other hand, daily doses of flecainide given with or without amiodarone were not significantly different (204 vs 209 mg/day).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean duration of the arrhythmia was 49 +/- 45 days. Mean cardiothoracic index was 0.49 +/- 0.03. Flecainide treatment was started intravenously with a bolus of 2 mg/kg over 10 minutes, followed by oral treatment (200 to 300 mg/day) according to body weight. Conversion to sinus rhythm was obtained in 49 patients (71%). The mean delay between initiation of treatment and restoration of sinus rhythm was 301 minutes (range 5 to 1,600). The left atrial diameter was smaller (40 +/- 1 mm) in patients who had successful cardioversion than in those who did not (46 +/- 1 mm) (p less than 0.05). Patients with atrial fibrillation lasting for less than 10 days had a higher conversion rate (79%) than patients with long-standing atrial fibrillation, in whom the conversion rate was only 38% (p less than 0.05). Conversion to sinus rhythm occurred in 33 patients during the first 5 minutes after injection. Adverse effects necessitated discontinuation of treatment in 4 patients (5.8%). Gastrointestinal disorders and dizziness occurred in 5 other patients but did not necessitate discontinuing treatment. In conclusion, flecainide is an effective drug for converting atrial fibrillation into sinus rhythm. Unlike quinidine, flecainide can be administered intravenously. The conversion rate with flecainide is higher in patients with a shorter duration of atrial fibrillation and smaller atria.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficacy, adverse effects and pharmacokinetics of flecainide were evaluated in 16 pediatric and young adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Patients had received an average of 2.8 drugs before flecainide was tried. The following mechanisms of supraventricular arrhythmias were determined in patients by intracardiac electrophysiologic studies: atrioventricular node reentry, 4; reentry through an accessory connection, 7; atrial automatic focus, 2; atrial flutter, 3. Twelve patients had normal cardiac anatomy and 4 had congenital heart disease. Each patient received 2.8 mg/kg/day of flecainide divided into 2 doses 12 hours apart. After 3 days, the dose was increased to 5.6 mg/kg/day if necessary. In 14 patients, serum flecainide concentrations measured 3 to 4 days after beginning therapy ranged from 0.1 to 0.8 micrograms/ml (mean 0.40). Flecainide successfully controlled SVT in 8 of 16 patients. SVT in 3 of 7 patients with accessory connections and in 3 of 4 patients with atrioventricular node reentry was successfully controlled. In 1 of 2 patients with atrial automatic tachycardia, SVT had been completely controlled over 16 months. Only 1 of 3 patients treated for atrial flutter responded. Follow-up for successfully treated patients ranged from 4 to 16 months (median 9). Seven patients continue to take flecainide. None of the patients had clinical congestive heart failure. No drug-related adverse effects were noted on the resting surface electrocardiogram. Flecainide rarely produced proarrhythmic effects in this series. The 2 that were observed were mild and caused no clinical problems. Noncardiovascular side effects also occurred infrequently.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three patients with concurrent supraventricular (SVT) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) were treated with class IC antiarrhythmic agents. Twenty-two patients had atrial fibrillation (17 with paroxysmal and 5 with chronic fibrillation), 1 patient had ectopic atrial tachycardia and 11 patients had reentrant paroxysmal SVT (8 with atrioventricular node reentrant tachycardia, 3 with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia). Of 5 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, 2 had only atrial fibrillation. Six patients had sustained VT and 27 had nonsustained VT. Twenty-nine patients had organic heart disease (16 with coronary artery disease, 8 with cardiomyopathy and 5 with valvular heart disease) and 4 had primary electrical disease. The mean ejection fraction was 40 +/- 14% (range 15 to 66%). The study population's arrhythmias were not controlled despite having received 2 to 5 (mean 3.1) previous drug trials. Eighteen patients were referred for treatment of SVT and 15 were referred for treatment of VT (mean symptom duration 107 months). Efficacy was determined in 13 of 33 patients with sustained SVT or VT by programmed electrical stimulation and in 20 of 33 by telemetry and 24-hour Holter response. Twenty-two flecainide and 15 encainide trials were conducted in the 33 patients. Four patients underwent trials with both drugs. Of 33 patients with coexisting SVT and VT, 15 (45%) were controlled with an IC agent alone and 3 continued therapy with an IC agent plus additional therapy (2 drugs, 1 antitachycardia pacing). During the follow-up period (mean 10.4 months), flecainide produced a complete response in 9 patients and encainide in 9 patients. SVT was not controlled in 7 patients and VT was not controlled in 7 patients. One patient had neither arrhythmia controlled. Atrial or ventricular proarrhythmia was seen in 9 of 33 patients (27%) (5 with ventricular and 4 with atrial arrhythmia). Noncardiac side effects were uncommon. Oral class IC agents may be effective therapy for some patients with coexisting VT and SVT of different mechanisms. Patients with such complex arrhythmias should be evaluated carefully because there is a potential for both atrial and ventricular proarrhythmia.\r"

Sixty-seven of these 83 patients entered an open clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term oral treatment with flecainide. Efficacy was evaluated by a patient diary of spontaneously occurring attacks during flecainide treatment and periods of withdrawal. In 24 patients, electrophysiologic study was repeated during oral therapy. During a mean follow-up of 22.8 months, the therapeutic response to flecainide (mean dose 263 mg/day) was good in 48 patients (71%) and fair in 7 patients (10%). In 8 patients (10%), an arrhythmogenic effect was seen (increased number and prolonged duration of supraventricular tachycardia episodes in 4 patients, spontaneous episodes of atrial fibrillation in 2 patients and sinoatrial block in 2 patients). No consistent abnormalities were seen in the laboratory tests. Extracardiac side effects were of minor importance and usually subsided spontaneously or disappeared after reduction of dosage. It is concluded that flecainide is a useful addition to the drugs already available for short- and long-term treatment of supraventricular tachycardia due to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrioventricular nodal reentry.\r"

This review provided 107 entries, but 5 were review articles and 22 were articles not translated into English. The remaining 80 articles or published abstracts form the basis for this report. A total of 1,371 courses of therapy with intravenous or oral flecainide, or both, were represented. Efficacy was defined by each investigator. Intravenous flecainide was successful in terminating ongoing tachycardias in 81% of reported cases of atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, 88% of AV reentrant tachycardias and 100% of atrial tachycardias. Atrial fibrillation or flutter was terminated by intravenous flecainide in 62% of cases and arrhythmias associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in 73%. Oral flecainide was successful in longer-term management of arrhythmia in 74 and 81% of patients with AV nodal and AV reentrant tachycardia, respectively, and in 83% with atrial tachycardia. Atrial flutter or fibrillation responded to oral drug in 61% of cases and arrhythmias related to Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in 61%. Adverse experiences were reported in studies totaling 695 patients (designated \"at-risk patients\"). They were not commented on in studies with the remaining 594 patients. Overall, a total of 6.9% of at-risk patients (3.7% of total patients) reported cardiac adverse experiences; 19% of at-risk patients (10% of total patients) reported at least 1 noncardiac adverse effect. Cardiac adverse events included worsened arrhythmias in 28, conduction disturbances in 15 and congestive heart failure in 5. The most frequent noncardiac adverse experiences were paresthesia and visual disturbance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients received pulmonary therapy and either standard diet (n = 10) or adjunctive enteral supplements (n = 12). Initial protein turnover, measured by [15N]glycine kinetics, showed alterations of protein synthesis (P Syn) and catabolism (P Cat), which correlated with the degree of underweight, and negligible net protein deposition (P Dep). With treatment both groups had significant increases in mean body weight and forced expiratory volume in 1 s, expressed as percent predicted value for height (FEV1) by 3 wk, but a significant correlation between initial underweight and subsequent weight gain was observed only in supplemented patients. Mean P Syn and P Dep increased significantly (p less than 0.001) only in the supplemented group. Pulmonary exacerbations in CF have important adverse effects on body-protein metabolism, similar to changes in protein-energy malnutrition and infection. These effects are reversed by short-term nutritional support. Strategic nutritional intervention should thus be considered in management, especially in malnourished patients.\r"

This technique allowed us to study 33 g pectin/L, isoviscous 400 g PEG 20,000/L, or 11 g guar/L when present with glucose in the stomach only, the intestine only, or in both stomach and intestine. Rates of gastric emptying and plasma glucose were lower when viscous polymer was present at both sites than at either site separately. Slowing of gastric emptying was an interactive outcome of viscosity at both loci, probably from slowed intestinal absorption of glucose with its exposure to more intestinal sensors. Reductions in postcibal glucose concentrations depended on slowing of both gastric emptying and intestinal absorption.\r"

Conditions are described for dithiothreitol reduction of DHAA followed by assay of total AA, with DHAA being determined by difference. DHAA accounted for less than 5% of the total plasma AA + DHAA in both healthy and diabetic subjects. Infection and postpartum-induced stresses resulted in no significant change in the AA content of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) per unit of blood but AA content per cell was decreased. When glucose concentration was increased, the Km for AA uptake by PMNs doubled. These chemical and physiological factors combined with the rapid movement of the vitamin between plasma and cells suggest that a reliable indicator of AA status remains to be identified.\r"

Urinary Zn excretion is the major source of Zn loss in the parenterally fed infant; factors causing increased zincuria will predispose the infant to Zn deficiency and affect the recommended Zn intake dosage. Histidine, threonine, and lysine have been shown to bind Zn increasing its renal ultrafilterability. The effect of the infusion of high and low lysine (206 +/- 34 vs 158 +/- 38 mg.kg-1.d-1; means +/- SD), threonine (147 +/- 24 vs 113 +/- 27), and histidine (124 +/- 34 vs 85 +/- 15) on urinary Zn excretion were determined in 23 newborns on TPN who received similar Zn intakes (6.8 +/- 1.4 mumol.kg-1.d-1). After a 72-h adaptation period each infant had urine collected for two 24-h periods. Despite the significant difference in amino acid intakes, mean urinary Zn excretion was identical (1.58 +/- 0.73 vs 1.56 +/- 0.63 mumol.kg-1.d-1). Hyperzincuria, therefore, does not occur when amino acids are infused at rates appropriate for the safety and nutritional maintenance of neonates.\r"

In the severe forms (marasmus, kwashiorkor, and marasmic kwashiorkor) the thymus was tiny and contained very little thymulin. The Zn content of the thymus was high whatever the nutritional state of the subject and was related significantly only to the presence of infections. In Senegalese children thymic atrophy and depleted thymulin content are associated with severe PEM but not systemic infection or depleted thymic Zn content.\r"

The effects of interferons alpha and beta given in short courses are only transient. Longer courses of intermittent therapy have resulted in seroconversion rates of up to 50 percent in Western European carriers. It is becoming apparent that patients infected with hepatitis B virus in adult life have a relative deficiency of interferon alpha, and it is these patients who have the best responses to protracted courses of intermittent therapy.\r"

Women with oligomenorrhea and elevated luteinizing hormone levels were diagnosed as having polycystic ovary syndrome primarily on the basis of endocrinology. All patients were treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog to suppress endogenous luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone so that ovulation induction with exogenous gonadotropins could be undertaken as in patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Interference in the process of ovulation by endogenous luteinizing hormone fluctuations was eliminated and pregnancies were achieved. The pregnancy rate in the group with polycystic ovary syndrome was 77% per treatment course (six cycles) while that in the group with subnormal progesterone profiles was 61.5%. Patients showing no abnormality achieved no pregnancy, demonstrating the redundancy of interference with normal ovarian function.\r"

We retrospectively evaluated the clinical profiles and conception cycle characteristics of 48 infertile women undergoing the induction of superovulation and intrauterine insemination. We compared 14 of these women who conceived multiple gestations (eight twins and six triplets) with 34 who conceived singleton gestations. We found no differences between the groups in age, parity, cause or duration of infertility, duration or amount of human menopausal gonadotropin administration, serum estradiol concentrations on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin injection, number of preovulatory-sized follicles, or number of motile sperm inseminated. We conclude that neither the patients' clinical characteristics nor the parameters evaluated in monitoring human menopausal gonadotropin cycles provide information helpful in predicting which superovulation cycles will result in multiple pregnancy.\r"

In El Dar 18% and Abu Jin 13% of the population had Symmers' fibrosis by ultrasonography. In contrast, only 6.3% in El Dar and 5.2% in Abu Jin with Symmers' fibrosis had splenomegaly, thus most of the population with Symmers' fibrosis would not have been diagnosed clinically. The degree of involvement was estimated by a set of previously defined criteria which ranged from mild (grade 1) to severe (grade 3). Involvement was greatest between 20-30 years and followed the age peak egg excretion rate by 5 years. The prevalence and degree of splenomegaly as well as the portal and splenic vein diameters increased with grade. The presence of hepatomegaly did not correlate with increasing grade. Ultrasonography is a much more sensitive technique than clinical evaluation in estimating the degree of Symmers' fibrosis in this population. A more accurate assessment of involvement will allow a more rational approach to the study of the pathophysiology of this complication and its eventual control.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-two female patients who underwent gynaecological operations as day cases received either a short pre-operative hypnotic induction or a brief discussion of equal duration. Hypnotized patients who underwent vaginal termination of pregnancy required significantly less methohexitone for induction of anaesthesia. They were also significantly more relaxed as judged by their visual analogue scores for anxiety. Less than half of the patients were satisfied with their knowledge about the operative procedure even after discussions with the surgeon and anaesthetist. A significant correlation was found between anxiety and perceived knowledge of procedures. The results suggest that pre-operative hypnosis can provide a quick and effective way to reduce pre-operative patient anxiety and anaesthetic requirements for gynaecological daycase surgery.\r"

Anaesthesia was maintained in both groups with nitrous oxide, oxygen and enflurane. Recovery was assessed quantitatively by measuring time to when they awoke and by a comparison of pre- and postoperative performance of p-deletion and postbox tests. Qualitative assessment of recovery and of postoperative pain was also undertaken. Patients completed a questionnaire to record the incidence of any anaesthetic-related symptoms on the first and second postoperative days. Patients who received midazolam required a reduced dose of methohexitone but their initial recovery time was prolonged significantly. The incidences of anaesthetic-related side effects and postoperative pain were similar in the two groups and while the questionnaires did not reveal any statistically significant differences in symptoms on the first 2 postoperative days, the results indicated that patients who received a larger induction dose of methohexitone were subjectively drowsier on the first day after operation.\r"

  ".W": "The authors measured the rate of carbon dioxide elimination (VCO2) in 25 pediatric patients (age 2 days to 9 yr) during total cardiopulmonary bypass at average venous blood temperatures ranging from 19.5 to 35.9 degrees C. A multiplexed mass spectrometer was connected to the gas inlet and exhaust ports of the bubble oxygenator, and the gas-phase Fick principle was used to determine VCO2. A curvilinear relationship was found between log VCO2 and venous blood temperature, and a quadratic regression equation (r2 = 0.74) was fit to the data. Q10 (the ratio of VCO2 before and after a 10 degree C temperature change) was estimated to be 2.7 or 3.0, depending on the analytic method used. Venous blood temperature as a predictor variable explained a greater proportion of the variability of log VCO2 than did nasopharyngeal or rectal temperatures. Analysis of covariance revealed that total circulatory arrest during bypass (utilized in 10 patients for 34 +/- 4 min, mean +/- SEM) affected the relationship of venous blood temperature with log VCO2, by increasing the y-intercept (P = .008) but not the slope. These data, with associated 95% prediction intervals, define the expected CO2 elimination rates at various temperatures during standard bypass conditions in our patients. Real-time measurement of VCO2 using mass spectrometry can be a useful routine monitor during CPB that may help to assess patient metabolic function, adequacy of perfusion, and oxygenator performance.\r"

Standard dye dilution cardiac outputs and an indirect Fick-CO2 technique were simultaneously determined. A rebreathing maneuver is described to estimate the oxygenated mixed venous PCO2 (PvCO2). This estimate of PvCO2 was combined with the end tidal PCO2 and CO2 production to give a non-invasive Fick estimate of the cardiac output. Non-invasive cardiac outputs correlated well with those measured by dye-dilution (r2 = 0.94) over a range of cardiac outputs from 490-7280 ml/min. All non-invasive determinations were within 15% of the line of identity, and within 22% of averaged replicate dye-dilution values. Our results agree with previous comparisons of indirect Fick-CO2 methods with invasive determinations of cardiac output. These data suggest that the indirect Fick-CO2 technique offers a rapid, non-invasive alternative to invasive monitoring of cardiac output.\r"

DESIGN: Prospective study of 104 persons before and after immunization. SETTING: Outpatient clinic and hospital ward. PATIENTS: Persons with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (n = 25), AIDS-related complex (n = 14), and HIV-seropositive men with only lymphadenopathy or no symptoms (n = 27). Controls were HIV-seronegative homosexual men (n = 22) and HIV-seronegative heterosexuals (n = 16). INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were immunized with inactivated vaccines containing 15 micrograms of each of the following influenza virus hemagglutinins: A/Taiwan/1/86 (HINI), A/Mississippi/1/85 (H3N2), A/Chile/1/83 (HINI), and B/Ann Arbor/1/86. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourfold or greater antibody responses occurred less frequently in subjects with HIV infections than in HIV-seronegative controls. Protective levels (1:64 or greater) of hemagglutination inhibition antibodies were attained by 94% to 100% of HIV-seronegative controls, 52% to 89% of HIV-seropositive asymptomatic subjects, and 13% to 50% of subjects with AIDS or AIDS-related complex. No increase in the prevalence or level of serum HIV p24 antigen or clinical deterioration was detected among HIV-infected persons after influenza immunization. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the poor antibody responses to influenza vaccines among HIV-infected subjects, even in many with no or minimal symptoms, alternative strategies for preventing influenza, such as booster doses of influenza vaccine, prophylaxis with amantidine, or both should be considered.\r"

DESIGN: A controlled, experimental trial. SETTING: Tertiary care referral center. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Five healthy volunteers participated in all portions of the study. INTERVENTIONS: A standard concentration of one of four representative nosocomial pathogens was placed on the gloved hand, spread, and allowed to dry. One of three different handcleansing agents--a nonmedicated soap, a 60% isopropyl alcohol preparation, or 4% chlorhexidine gluconate--was used to cleanse the gloves, which were cultured using a broth-bag technique. The gloves were then removed and the hands were cultured in a similar manner. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The handwashing agents reduced the median log10 counts of organisms to 2.1 to 3.9 after an inoculation of 10(7) colony forming units. The proportion of positive glove cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, 8% to 100%; Serratia marcescens, 16% to 100%; and Candida albicans, 4% to 60% varied greatly after use of the different handcleansers (P less than 0.001), and varied considerably for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 20% to 48% (P = 0.085). After the gloves were removed, the differences among the observed proportions of hands contaminated with the test organisms varied from 5% to 50%, depending on the handcleansing agent used (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In the era of universal precautions these data suggest that it may not be prudent to wash and reuse gloves between patients. Further, handwashing is strongly encouraged after removal of gloves.\r"

Generally, the challenges to the moral integrity of physicians practicing in HMOs are neither intractable nor in all cases unique, although special arrangements may have to be made to ensure that ethical standards are upheld. Independent practice associations pose particular problems. Finally, whether or not an HMO is a for-profit enterprise is a significant consideration.\r"

Adult cartilages, in which the calcification process is already complete, contained only chondroitin 6-sulfate. The results suggest that chondroitin 6-sulfate is related to the integrity of the articular surfaces, whereas chondroitin 4-sulfate seems to be an important factor in the calcification process. The pathogenesis of the bone and cartilage alterations that occur in patients affected by heritable disorders of the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate are discussed in view of these findings.\r"

It is now reported that MCCM, recombinant human IL-1 alpha (rHuIL-1 alpha), rHuIL-1 beta, and all-trans-retinoic acid elevate the u-PA messenger RNA (mRNA) levels to a steady-state value within 2 hours, while dexamethasone (10(-7)M) inhibits this increase. For both situations, when the u-PA activity is either stimulated or reduced, the changes in the u-PA mRNA levels parallel the changes in the u-PA activity, and it is suggested that modulation of gene transcription plays an important role.\r"

Recumbency increased the mean (SEM) concentration to 160 (13) pmol/l. The plasma concentration of cardiodilatin in 24 patients with congestive cardiac failure was much higher (964 (175) pmol/l) than in the normal subjects. It was highest in those with heart failure in New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV and the concentration correlated both with atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations and left ventricular ejection fraction. Concentrations rose during induced tachycardia in three patients tested. Chromatography showed a single clean peak of plasma cardiodilatin immunoreactivity. It seems that cardiodilatin is a second circulating cardiac peptide that is jointly released with atrial natriuretic peptide by common stimuli. Other workers have reported that, like atrial natriuretic peptide, three partial cardiodilatin sequences can stimulate renal particulate guanylate cyclase and increase cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The simultaneous release of cardiodilatin in higher circulating concentrations than atrial natriuretic peptide may be relevant to the finding that appropriate concentrations of exogenous atrial natiuretic peptide alone do not produce the full renal effects associated with endogenous peptide release.\r"

Experimentally measured data, on the other hand, implicitly include appropriate contributions of all these processes. Experimentally derived beta values are tabulated and the rationale for their measurement is discussed. The beta value for a low-Z ion chamber calibration in free space with a 60Co gamma-ray beam is 1.002.

Light and electron microscopic studies showed a reduced thickness of the transitional epithelium together with localised disruption of intercellular junctions and infiltration of red blood cells. The functional studies involved in vitro demonstration of stable phasic peristaltic contractions which were fundamentally altered by the addition of urine. The changes in motility included increase in contractile frequency and elevation of basal tone, inducing a state of hypermotility which could be equated with ureteric spasm. These changes were partly reversible upon administration of the histamine l-blocker, mepyramine. Evidence is presented to show that these changes might be induced in vivo by histamine released from mast cells triggered by urine leaking through a damaged urothelial barrier. The functional consequences (pain, spasm) are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "An open, prospective, randomised, comparative study of \"Trisdine\" and kanamycin-colistin bladder instillations in reducing significant bacteriuria during intermittent urethral catheterisation was conducted. Trisdine is an aqueous solution of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.01% with added ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid disodium salt and TRIS buffer at final concentrations of 1.34 mMoles and 0.01 Molar respectively. All patients (15 males and 3 females) admitted with acute spinal cord trauma and bladder involvement requiring intermittent catheterisation for more than 5 days during a 12-month period were studied. There was no significant difference in the mean incidence of significant bacteriuria during intermittent catheterisation in the 7 males who had kanamycin-colistin bladder instillations compared with the 8 males who had Trisdine instillations. A comparison could not be made in the females because there were only 3 patients. Because Trisdine is more stable at ambient temperatures, is less likely to select antibiotic-resistant bacteria and is less expensive, it is concluded that Trisdine is preferable to kanamycin-colistin solution for bladder instillations during intermittent catheterisation.\r"

Fifteen patients, aged between 70 and 79 years (mean 73.1), have been treated for high grade, invasive bladder cancer using neoadjuvant intravenous cisplatin (80-100 mg/m2) plus radical radiotherapy (60 Gy in 6 weeks). Objective response was achieved in 14 patients. The median survival was 22 months, with 6 patients surviving 3 years or longer. Acute and late side effects were not excessive (no cases of W.H.O. grade IV toxicity), as demonstrated by clinical examination and the use of questionnaires (including linear analogue self-assessment scales) to assess quality of life. This aggressive treatment programme can achieve a high remission rate and prolonged survival in elderly patients with high risk bladder cancer without causing excessive morbidity.\r"

The events studied were the recurrence free rate, the recurrence rate/year, and the number of new tumours developing/year. At the initial cystoscopy the tumours were completely resected and the patients randomised to have no instillation of mitomycin C, a single instillation of 40 mg in 40 ml of water at that cystoscopy, or a single instillation and then four further instillations. All patients had follow up cystoscopies every three months for the first year, twice in the second year, and yearly thereafter. After a median of 12 months, follow up information was available for 397 patients. Patients receiving both the single instillation of mitomycin C and the instillations at five cystoscopic examinations had significantly lower yearly recurrence rates and tumour rates than those in the control group, and the group receiving multiple instillations fared significantly better than those receiving a single instillation. The figures on progression to invasive cancer were too small to allow conclusions to be drawn.\r"

One year after orchidectomy or local irradiation in these four men no aneuploid cells were found in the semen. These findings show that a detectable proportion of malignant germ cells may be released into the seminal fluid of patients with carcinoma in situ of the testis. Analysis of seminal fluid may therefore aid in screening for early neoplasia of the testis.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment with buserelin, an agonist of luteinising hormone releasing hormone, and human menopausal gonadotrophin was compared with the conventional treatment of clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotrophin in the outcome of in vitro fertilisation. Seventy seven infertile women had 83 cycles of treatment with buserelin and human menopausal gonadotrophin, and concurrently another 328 infertile women were treated with clomiphene citrate and human menopausal gonadotrophin. Seven (8%) cycles were cancelled owing to inadequate super-ovulation or ovarian hyperstimulation in the women receiving buserelin and 103 (31%) were cancelled because of poor follicular development in those receiving clomiphene citrate. The mean number of oocytes recovered was significantly higher with buserelin (9.5 (SD 4.5) v 5.5 (2.2)) as was the mean number of embryos obtained (4.3 (2.4) v 2.9 (1.7)). Significantly more women who had an embryo transfer became clinically pregnant after treatment with buserelin (53% (30/57) v 30% (48/159), or 36% v 14% of treatment cycles). Altogether 33% (10) of pregnancies in women treated with buserelin were multiple compared with 23% (11) in those treated conventionally. Of the 17 completed pregnancies in women treated with buserelin, 11 resulted in the birth of live babies (eight singletons, two sets of twins, and one set of triplets) and six failed, five before 12 weeks' gestation and one at 22 weeks. The 13 continuing pregnancies (32 weeks) were eight singletons, two sets of twins, and three sets of triplets. Of the 48 completed pregnancies in women treated with clomiphene citrate, 35 resulted in the birth of live babies (26 singletons, five sets of twins and four sets of triplets) and 13 failed, eleven before 12 weeks' gestation and two by 27 weeks. Buserelin increased the chance of pregnancy after in vitro fertilisation compared with conventional treatment, but the risk of multiple pregnancy may be increased.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the thrombolytic efficacy and the effect on the systemic fibrinolytic system of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator doses of 20 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg were compared in a randomised study. Tissue plasminogen activator was infused intravenously over 90 minutes in 50 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction of four hours' duration or less; on average the infusion was started 135 minutes (range 20 to 240) after the onset of pain. The affected artery was patent at the end of the 90 minute infusion in 14/17 (82%) of those who received 100 mg, 12/17 (71%) of those who received 50 mg, and 8/16 (50%) of those who received 20 mg. Regardless of dose, reperfusion rates were significantly better for patients treated within two hours of the onset of symptoms (81%) than for those treated in the third and fourth hours (54%). At the end of the infusion serum fibrinogen concentrations fell to 86% of the preinfusion value after 20 mg, 75% after 50 mg, and 63% after 100 mg, and similar dose dependent changes occurred in plasminogen, (alpha 2 anti-plasmin, and fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products. The mean infarct related regional third ejection fraction was 46% for patients with grade 2 or 3 reperfusion and 35% for those with grade 0 or 1. Ventricular fibrillation occurred in six (12%) patients during the infusion of tissue plasminogen activator, but no late ventricular fibrillation occurred. Bleeding was minimal, reocclusion occurred in three patients, and four patients died from cardiac causes. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator is an effective thrombolytic agent which produces better reperfusion rates after a 50 or 100 mg dose than after a 20 mg dose. The effect on the systemic fibrinolytic system is dose dependent. Successful reperfusion results in improvement of left ventricular function.\r"

The process whereby those decisions were made and the willingness of consultants to offer treatment were investigated. A retrospective survey of all (362) mentally abnormal men remanded to Winchester prison for psychiatric reports over the five years 1979-83 showed that one in five were rejected for treatment by the NHS consultant psychiatrist responsible for their care. Those with mental handicaps, organic brain damage, or a chronic psychotic illness rendering them unable to cope independently in the community were the most likely to be rejected. They posed the least threat to the community in terms of their criminal behaviour yet were more likely to be sentenced to imprisonment. Such subjects were commonly described by consultants as too disturbed or potentially dangerous to be admitted to hospital or as criminals and unsuitable for treatment. Consultants in mental hospitals were most likely and those in district general hospitals and academic units least likely to accept prisoners. The fact that many mentally ill and mentally handicapped patients can receive adequate care and treatment only on reception into prison raises serious questions about the adequacy of current management policies and the range of facilities provided by regional health authorities.\r"

A retrospective study was carried out to compare the effectiveness of the health care services for men remanded to Winchester prison from Oxford and Wessex regions over the five years 1979-83. Thirty seven (30%) of 124 prisoners from Oxford region were rejected for treatment compared with 36 (16%) of the 220 men from Wessex region. Men from Oxford region were significantly more likely to be recommended for admission to a special hospital than those from Wessex (13/124 (10%) v 9/220 (4%), respectively) and significantly less likely to be recommended for admission to a hospital in the catchment area (35/124 (28%) v 94/220 (43%)). Men on remand from Oxford region were significantly more often perceived as being disruptive or aggressive by hospital staff and more likely to be labelled as having psychopathic or personality disorders. These differences may have reflected different attitudes towards mentally abnormal offenders and the allowances in the services available in the two regions; in particular, Oxford region did not have a secure unit or a forensic psychiatrist. If mentally ill prisoners do not receive the treatment that they need they run the risk of being criminalised. Most such men are best treated in general psychiatric units; only a few require secure conditions and staff with specialised psychiatric skills.\r"

The animals were divided into seven groups and the effectiveness of OP-41483, aspirin (ASA), OKY-046 and CV-3988 was studied. All rabbits died between 8 and 24 h after injury in the no therapy group. Renal function tests in this group showed a decrease in Cler and an increase in FENa and CH2O. Such changes were improved slightly with infusion therapy. On the contrary, with OP-41483, OKY-046 and ASA, distinct improvements were observed (in order of extent of improvement), but with CV-3988 the improvements were rather small. As a result these drugs may also be effective in preventing organ failure after burn injury, but as such changes presumably occur immediately after the burn it is considered that a fast-acting agent such as OP-41483 is the most effective form of treatment.\r"

All nevus cells had S-100 protein, but did not have neurofilament proteins. The nevic corpuscle and Type C nevus cell were positively stained with AHMY1 indicating the presence of the Schwann cell associated antigen, while Type A and B nevus cells were entirely negative. This suggests that the nevic corpuscle and Type C nevus cell are closely related to the Schwann cell and differ from Type A and B nevus cells in their development.\r"

The prophylactic regimen consisted of endovesical instillations alternating doxorubicin and mitomycin C. The first six instillations were given at weekly intervals. The remaining ten were given at monthly intervals beginning 4 weeks after the resection. At the mean follow-up time of 28 +/- 10 standard deviations (SD) months, 18 patients (30%) had a recurrence. Twelve of these 18 patients (20%) had a recurrence during treatment. The overall number of recurrences was 46 for a 100 patient-months recurrence rate of 2.72. Nine patients (15%) had a regression in stage and/or grade at the first recurrence, five (8.3%) had no change, and four (6.6%) had a worsening. At the first recurrence, the treatment was continued with augmented dosages of the same drugs. However, of 12 patients undergoing such second-line treatment, only two did not have further tumors. In three patients (5%), a subsequent muscle invasive tumor appeared. This two-drug treatment does not appear to be more effective than the usual one-drug prophylaxis. However, it does lead to an hypotheses about the chemosensitivity of the superficial tumors of the bladder and its correlation with the prognosis.\r"

This was observed more frequently in cases of diffuse, but not nodular, bone marrow involvement by tumor cells. More particularly, excessive bone resorption (a major feature of MM) associated with a normal to low bone formation (i.e., uncoupling bone disease) was the most frequent feature and in the same range of that observed in overt MM. However, as opposed to MM, this bone resorption was characteristically mediated by small mononucleated osteoclasts (i.e., microresorption). The same phenomena of abnormal bone remodeling, the uncoupling process, excessive bone resorption, and above all microresorption were confirmed by the detailed bone study of five cases of B-cell cancers other than MM presenting lytic bone lesions and hypercalcemia. The current findings are important for clarifying the biology of these B-cell malignant diseases, and also could be of diagnostic and prognostic value.\r"

Therefore, systemic hemodynamic and anterior left ventricular regional coronary blood-flow (thermodilution) data were measured during administration of NTG into the left coronary artery, before and 10 min after intravenous propranolol (0.1 mg/kg) in 22 patients. Six patients (Group 1) had normal left coronary arteries and nine (Group 2) had severe coronary artery disease with at least greater than 70% narrowing of the left anterior descending artery. In seven additional patients (three without and four with greater than 70% left anterior descending coronary artery disease), measurements were obtained with constant-paced heart rates (Group 3). Before beta blockade, NTG (200 mcg) significantly increased anterior regional great-vein flow [for Group 1, 84 +/- 38% (81 +/- 20 to 140 +/- 60 ml/min); Group 2, 39 +/- 41% (61 +/- 26 to 83 +/- 38 ml/min); and Group 3, 87 +/- 55% (75 +/- 36 to 144 +/- 86 ml/min)].

To determine whether the calcium-binding additives in ionic contrast media contribute to the hemodynamic effects of contrast media during coronary angiography, left coronary angiography was performed in anesthetized dogs. In nine closed-chest dogs, 10 cc of H76 and R76 were injected in each dog in a blinded, randomized fashion. The effect of H76 and R76 on left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) and left ventricular diastolic pressure (LVDP), on mean aortic pressure (MAP), and on left ventricular (LV) dp/dt was recorded. Compared with H76, R76 produced a greater decrease in the LVSP (77 +/- 25 mmHg vs 48 +/- 17 mmHg P less than .05), MAP (72 +/- 24 mmHg vs 38 +/- 18 mmHg P less than .01), and LV dp/dt (747 +/- 87 mmHg/sec vs 460 +/- 81 mmHg/sec P less than .01). In nine additional open-chest dogs, left coronary angiography was performed 1 hour after occlusion of the proximal LAD coronary artery. Seven cc R76 produced a 35 +/- 15 mmHg decrease in LVSP, compared with 20 +/- 9 mmHg with H76 (P less than .01). The LV dp/dt decreased 720 +/- 387 mmHg/sec with R76, compared with 462 +/- 222 mmHg/sec with H76 (P less than 0.05). Thus, R76 produces significantly greater hemodynamic abnormalities than H76. Contrast media lacking calcium-binding agents may be preferable for coronary angiography.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated whether there is a relation between renin dependency of two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats and the density of renal glomerular and vascular atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) receptors. Conscious 2K1C rats with blood pressure of 150 mm Hg or higher were classified according to their sensitivity to the blood pressure-lowering effect of the angiotensin II antagonist saralasin. Both hypertension groups had lower body weights and greater relative heart weights than normotensive controls. Hematocrit was lower and plasma volume higher in saralasin-resistant animals than in either saralasin-sensitive or control rats. Plasma renin activity was higher in the saralasin-sensitive group than in the resistant rats. Plasma ANF concentration was greater in saralasin-resistant than in either normotensive or saralasin-sensitive animals. ANF was reduced in both atria of saralasin-resistant 2K1C animals but only in the left atrium of the sensitive group. Both hypertensive groups showed an increased ventricular ANF concentration. The number of glomerular ANF binding sites was significantly lower in the clipped kidney of both hypertensive groups. This lower density of binding sites was accompanied by an increased affinity. In saralasin-sensitive rats, the density of glomerular ANF receptors in the nonclipped kidney was significantly higher than in the controls. Saralasin-resistant rats exhibited a decreased number of vascular ANF binding sites in both mesenteric arteries and aorta. We conclude that through modulation of its glomerular and vascular receptors, ANF may contribute to the differential sodium handling of saralasin-sensitive and -resistant 2K1C hypertensive rats and to the reduced vascular responsiveness to ANF observed in the saralasin-resistant hypertensive rats.\r"

Occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 2 hours followed by 4 hours of reperfusion in anesthetized cats results in a large washout of creatine kinase into the blood (32 +/- 7 IU/mg protein) and an area of necrotic tissue comprising 52 +/- 5% of the area at risk and 9 +/- 0.6% of the left ventricle. Intravenous administration of t-PA (500 IU/kg.min) for 30 minutes alone at reperfusion or infusion of CGS-13080 (500 micrograms/kg.hr) had no effect on washout of creatine kinase or extent of necrotic tissue development. Administration of the same doses of both t-PA and CGS-13080 together markedly attenuated creatine kinase release to 10 +/- 2 IU/mg protein (p less than 0.01) and reduced the area of necrotic tissue to 9 +/- 2% of the area at risk and only 1.3 +/- 0.3% of the left ventricle (p less than 0.001). No significant sustained effects of these agents were observed on mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, or the pressure rate index in these experiments. Thus, t-PA and CGS-13080 exert synergistic effects in preserving myocardial integrity in cats subjected to acute myocardial ischemia followed by reperfusion. The mechanism of this beneficial effect does not appear to be via reduced myocardial oxygen demand, increased myocardial oxygen supply, or enhanced inhibition of thromboxane A2 formation. The mechanism of this anti-ischemic effect is not clear but may involve a metabolic or a cytoprotective effect.\r"

The clearance half-time (t1/2) for the predominant initial clearance phase was 3.1 +/- 0.5 minutes (n = 4). MVO2 was varied over a fourfold range by hypoxia and phenylephrine stimulation (t1/2, 7.2 +/- 1.2 and 2.2 +/- 0.2 minutes, respectively) and in the presence of alternate substrates (lactate, 2 mM; DL-3-hydroxybutyrate, 20 mM; and palmitate, 0.1 mM), which did not modify either tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux or acetate kinetics. A good correlation (r = 0.93) was observed between k, the rate constant for the initial phase of 14CO2 clearance, and TCA cycle flux, estimated from oxygen consumption. In contrast to results with [1-14C]acetate, lactate (2 mM) increased t1/2 for 14CO2 clearance from a bolus injection of [1-14C]palmitate from 3.0 +/- 0.4 minutes (n = 3) at control to 4.3 +/- 0.2 minutes (n = 3, p less than 0.01). Addition of acetate in nontracer amounts (0.5 or 5 mM) caused significant underestimation of TCA cycle flux when estimated with [1-14C]acetate. 14CO2 clearance accounted for 88-98% of total effluent 14C between 10 and 20 minutes after [1-14C]acetate bolus injection; rate constants for clearance of 14CO2 and total 14C clearance were very similar during this period, and these two rate constants did not differ significantly from each other under any conditions tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the 19F spectra that report [Ca2+]i changed dramatically and reproducibly during the cardiac cycle, no changes were detectable in gated phosphorus spectra. We exploited the ability to control the coronary arterial flow of our hearts to investigate the mechanism of the fall in contractility that results from a decrease in perfusion even when the flow suffices to sustain normal high energy phosphate concentrations. Under these conditions, the amplitude of Ca2+ transients falls markedly along with the decline in pressure. This down-regulation of Ca2+ transients constitutes a novel protective mechanism that minimizes energy demand during low-flow ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-eight patients with acute \"transmural\" myocardial infarction presenting within 6 hours (range, 1.3-5.8 hours) of onset of chest pain were given intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a dosage of 1 mg/kg during 90 minutes. Coronary angiography at 90 minutes revealed a patent infarct-related coronary artery in 52 patients (76%). These patients were randomized either to treatment by continuous infusion of heparin alone (27 patients) or to treatment by heparin and a maintenance infusion of rt-PA at a dosage of 0.8 mg/kg during 4 hours (25 patients). Coronary angiography was repeated 60 minutes after the start of the maintenance infusion and again after 8-14 days. Acute symptomatic reocclusion of the infarct-related artery occurred during the 1-hour observation period in five (19%) patients treated with heparin alone but in none of the patients treated with rt-PA (p = 0.05). The measured residual stenosis of the patent infarct-related coronary artery was similar in the heparin-treated and the rt-PA-treated groups at 90 minutes infusion: 66 +/- 14% versus 68 +/- 13% diameter stenosis, respectively (mean +/- SD) and 1.1 +/- 1.1 mm2 versus 0.82 +/- 0.7 mm2 area (p = 0.35). At 8-14 days after infusion, residual stenosis was unchanged in the heparin-treated group, but it improved to 55 +/- 17% (p = 0.001) and 1.6 +/- 1.2 mm2 (p = 0.003) in the rt-PA-treated group. At 90 minutes of infusion, residual intraluminal thrombus was observed in 29 of the 52 patients (56%) with a comparably measured distribution in the two groups (p = 0.43). At 150 minutes, however, the extent of intraluminal thrombus was significantly reduced in the rt-PA-treated group as compared with the heparin-treated group (p = 0.03). In-hospital ischemic events (symptomatic reocclusion, unstable angina, or cardiovascular death) occurred in 12 patients of the heparin-treated group but only in three patients of the rt-PA-treated group (p = 0.03). Fibrinogen levels decreased to 65 +/- 21% of baseline at 90 minutes of rt-PA infusion. During the rt-PA maintenance infusion, fibrinogen fell slightly from 63 +/- 26 to 57 +/- 28% (p = 0.18). This study shows that after successful reperfusion with 1 mg/kg rt-PA during 90 minutes, a maintenance infusion of 0.8 mg/kg rt-PA during 4 hours prevents acute symptomatic coronary artery reocclusion, and it reduces the frequency of ischemic events and the severity of residual coronary artery stenosis at hospital discharge.\r"

The recent availability of monoclonal antibodies that differentiate products of plasmin lysis of fibrin from those of lysis of fibrinogen should permit delineation of the relative fibrin specificity of different plasminogen activators or of different doses of the same activator in vivo. Thus, their use should accelerate and facilitate development of implementation of optimal dose regimens for diverse activators and combinations of activators. The present study was designed to determine whether assay of such markers effectively differentiates effects of two doses of t-PA, each of which are comparably effective in opening infarct-related arteries, in patients studied at the Washington University Clinical Unit of the National Institutes of Health-sponsored Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Trial. The extent of lysis of fibrin and of lysis of fibrinogen by plasmin resulting from administration of t-PA was evaluated in 19 patients given 150 mg t-PA over 6 hours and 17 given 100 mg over the same interval by assay of serially obtained plasma samples for crosslinked fibrin degradation products (XL-FDP) and B beta 1-42, a peptide released when fibrinogen is degraded to fragment X by plasmin. XL-FDP were markedly elevated after 6-hour infusions of both doses of t-PA. However, elevations were not more with the higher dose [peak value, 4,321 +/- 986 ng/ml (+/- SEM)] compared with the lower dose (3,397 +/- 1,096 ng/ml) (p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nitroglycerin was initially infused in incremental doses from 1 to 50 micrograms/min in all patients to determine the dose required to reduce mean arterial pressure by 10% and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 30%. After a washout period, 10 patients received 5 g methionine i.v. and five patients received an equal volume of 5% dextrose in water (control). Nitroglycerin dose titration was then repeated. Methionine alone induced no hemodynamic effects, but after methionine infusion, there was a significant reduction in the nitroglycerin infusion rate required to reach each hemodynamic endpoint (p less than 0.01). In the control group, there was no significant change in responsiveness to nitroglycerin between infusions. Thus, methionine potentiates the hemodynamic effects of acutely administered intravenous nitroglycerin.\r"

To assess the influence of nitroglycerin on platelets and vasoconstriction, quantitative 111In-labeled platelet deposition (no platelets x 10(6)/cm2) of the injured segment and the degree of angiographic vasoconstriction (percent diameter narrowing proximal and distal to the dilated segment) produced during injury by balloon angioplasty of the common carotid arteries were studied in heparinized normal pigs that were sacrificed immediately after the procedure. In deeply injured (injury extending through the internal elastic lamina) compared with mildly injured (deendothelialization only) arteries, there was both greater platelet deposition (63.8 vs. 6.9, p = 0.04) and more vasoconstriction (30% vs. 19%, p = 0.02). In the presence of deep arterial wall injury, nitroglycerin given intravenously at a dose sufficient to lower mean arterial pressure by 9 +/- 2% significantly decreased both platelet deposition (16.2 vs. 63.8, p less than 0.008) and the vasoconstrictive response (20 vs. 30%, p less than 0.02) relative to control. However, in the presence of mild arterial wall injury, nitroglycerin decreased vasoconstriction relative to control (10% vs. 19%, p less than 0.01) without causing a significant decrease in the already low level of platelet deposition (5.6 vs. 6.9, respectively; p = NS), suggesting a direct smooth muscle relaxant effect of nitroglycerin. This is the first reported in vivo effectiveness of nitroglycerin in the reduction of platelet deposition after deep arterial injury.\r"

Ninety-eight patients received 25 mg of indomethacin three times daily for the first six postoperative weeks; the remaining 95 patients received a placebo treatment. No further anti-inflammatory drugs were allowed during the six weeks. SAP was measured preoperatively and six weeks and 12 weeks after surgery. No patients at risk for developing heterotopic bone after THA could be identified from the preoperative level of SAP. The level of SAP six weeks after THA gradually increased with the amount of HBF. A rise in SAP above 250 IU/liter 12 weeks after surgery was associated with the development of severe heterotopic bone in 13 of 17 patients. Indomethacin inhibited the development of heterotopic bone associated with a rise in SAP following THA. Future studies on HBF and SAP following THA should include information on patient use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the early postoperative period.\r"

Mean plasma immunoreactive ANP did not increase in response to changes in osmolality and rose to a peak of 118 pg/ml during the alpha-hANP infusion. alpha-hANP produced significant suppression of mean plasma arginine vasopressin over the 60 min after the infusions. 4.

Observations of similar increases in urine sodium and potassium excretion and a transient decrease in urine flow after both meals suggest that the protein content of the meal is not an important contributory factor in these responses to feeding. 3. Absolute delivery of sodium and water out of the proximal tubules (assessed by the lithium clearance method) was higher after both meals than while fasting; fractional lithium clearance was higher after the low protein meal than the high protein meal and while fasting. Absolute reabsorption from proximal tubules was increased after only the high protein meal. 4. A transient decrease in the fraction of water delivered to distal nephron segments that appeared in the urine (fractional distal water excretion) was observed after both meals. Fractional distal sodium excretion and absolute distal sodium and water reabsorption increased after both meals. 5. Since plasma atrial natriuretic peptide either decreased (high protein meal) or remained unchanged (low protein meal and fasting), it is unlikely that this hormone is involved in the hyperfiltration after the high protein meal and the natriuresis after both high and low protein meals.\r"

Spontaneous EEG was continuously recorded from the frontal cortex and hippocampus using implanted electrodes. The SER showed paroxysmal and synchronized 5-7-Hz spike-wave-like complexes in both cortical and hippocampal EEG during the absence-like state, which was characterized by immobility and staring. The animal also exhibited tonic convulsion without external stimulation concomitant with low-voltage fast waves on cortical and hippocampal EEG. In some animals, sporadic low-amplitude spikes appeared in the low-voltage fast waves during tonic convulsion. the absence-like seizures were inhibited by trimethadione (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally, i.p.) and ethosuximide 100 mg/kg i.p.), whereas the tonic convulsion was not affected by these drugs. In contrast, phenytoin (20 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited the tonic seizures without affecting the absence-like seizures. Phenobarbital (10 mg/kg i.p.) and valproate (200 mg/kg i.p.) inhibited both seizures to a similar degree. These results suggest that the SER, with both absence-like and tonic seizures, is a useful model for evaluation of AEDS.\r"

Five were normally developed, 5 were receiving VPA-monotherapy, and only 2 patients were aged less than 3 years. The first clinical symptoms of impending hepatotoxicity usually included nausea, vomiting, and apathy; pathologic laboratory tests reflected liver failure. Liver histology revealed microvesicular steatosis, cell necrosis, and bile duct proliferation of varying degree. An abnormal metabolite, 4-ene-VPA, was detected in all examined patients (six of six) and persisted after drug withdrawal. The pathogenesis of fatal liver failure during VPA treatment remains unknown. World-wide, approximately 100 fatalities have been reported in relation to VPA treatment. More than 90% were aged less than 20 years, 95% developed their first symptoms within the first 6 months of treatment, and 16 were treated with VPA alone. Since it is difficult precisely to define a group at risk for fatalities with VPA, careful clinical and laboratory monitoring with a special focus on vomiting and apathy, liver enzymes, and coagulation tests seem mandatory during the first 6 months after introduction of VPA. Taking into account the considerable number of fatalities during VPA treatment, the indication for its use requires careful reevaluation.\r"

Several clinical criteria are associated with an increased risk of developing this complication, but more specific predictors are needed. It has been postulated that 4-en-VPA or one of its further metabolites may be responsible for the hepatic toxicity and that under certain conditions the metabolism of VPA is shifted to this product. We postulated that measurement of serum concentrations of 4-en-VPA or another metabolite might be a simple technique that would be predictive of risk for developing idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Because this complication is rare, we chose to analyze our data by a multiple linear regression model, exploring associations between VPA or three of its metabolites and clinical risk factors for hepatotoxicity. 4-en-VPA correlated with older age and absence of encephalopathy. 4-en-VPA was only seen in patients receiving polytherapy; all patients were also receiving CBZ. 2-en-VPA correlated with poor nutritional status. We conclude that routine measurement of serum 4-en-VPA is unlikely to be a useful predictor of risk for developing fatal hepatotoxicity. Serum concentrations of 4-en-VPA may not reflect presence or effects in the liver as it may be metabolized to further intermediates or be bound to tissue. Thus, serum levels of 4-en-VPA do not reflect its important role in the pathogenesis of hepatotoxicity. This metabolite was detected only in patients receiving polytherapy, a potent risk factor for developing this rare complication.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study, 22 children with recently manifested infantile spasms (18 patients with symptomatic and 4 with idiopathic infantile spasms) were treated with sodium valproate (VPA). Before VPA was instituted, a loading test was performed to exclude abnormal patterns of VPA metabolites by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy of serum and urine. This test was repeated during VPA therapy; an abnormal pattern of VPA metabolites was not observed. VPA was started in increasing dosage until infantile spasms were controlled or a maximum dose of 100 mg/kg/day was reached. If VPA did not control seizures or at least reduce frequency significantly after a trial of 4-6 weeks, dexamathasone was added to VPA. If focal seizures occurred in association with localized epileptogenic EEG discharges, carbamazepine (CBZ) was added to VPA. After 4 weeks of VPA monotherapy, infantile spasms were controlled in 11 children. After 3 months of therapy, 16 children were free of seizures (14 patients VPA monotherapy), and 4 children had reduction of seizure frequency to less than 25%. VPA doses varied between 40 and 100 mg/kg/day (mean 74). The mean plasma concentration was 113 micrograms/ml (range 46-177). After 6 months of therapy, total seizure control was achieved in 20 of 22 patients (16 children VPA monotherapy). The mean observation time was 16 1/2 months (range 6-36 months). There were seven relapses in six children during the first 7 months of therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight patients with complex partial and/or tonic-clonic seizures were treated with an 8 p.m. single dose of carbamazepine slow release (CBZ-SR) monotherapy. The steady-state serum level profiles of carbamazepine (CBZ) and its metabolites CBZ-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) and 10,11-dihydro-CBZ-10,11-diole (CBZD) during 24 h in 21 of 48 patients treated with daily single doses of 8.4 (+/- 2.4) mg/kg body weight CBZ-SR were determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography procedure. The 8 a.m. CBZ levels correlated very well with the mean CBZ levels of the 24-h profile. Unlike CBZD, the individual 24-h mean CBZE levels also correlated well with the respective CBZ levels (CBZE = 14.2% +/- 2.9 of CBZ). Increasing CBZ-SR doses does not result in a proportional increase of CBZ levels. Clinical efficacy of changing from CBZ standard tablets under mono- or combination therapy or from therapy with other antiepileptic drugs to once-daily evening CBZ-SR monotherapy or commencement CBZ-SR therapy in previously untreated patients was monitored in 35 of 48 patients for a period of 8 months to 2 years. Complete seizure control was observed in 51% of patients and more than 75% reduction of seizure frequency in 14%. Eight of 11 previously untreated patients became seizure free. With change from CBZ monotherapy to CBZ-SR single-dose therapy, five of six patients became seizure free. Changing from other therapeutic regimens to CBZ-SR once-daily evening monotherapy was less successful.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have indicated that ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG)/human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or clomiphene citrate (CC) is associated with luteal phase defect. To assess the efficiency of luteal support by hCG to an infertile population undergoing ovulation induction, with CC/hCG or hMG/hCG, we have randomly administered 2500 IU hCG intramuscularly on days 3, 6, and 9 after ovulation induction by 10,000 IU of hCG to 74 patients on 265 treatment cycles. As controls served 357 ovulation induction cycles in the same 74 patients. The treatment cycles were randomly alternated with control cycles so that each patient served as her own control. However, the mean +/- standard deviation (SD) midluteal P was 38.1 +/- 10.8 ng/ml in the study group versus 15.7 +/- 10.5 ng/ml in the control group (P less than 0.001). Luteal phase length was 15.4 +/- 1.5 days in the treatment group versus 12.1 +/- 1.7 in the control group (P less than 0.01). In the treatment group, 64.8% of the patients achieved pregnancy (27% pregnancies/treatment cycle) versus 47.3% in the control group (11.5% pregnancies/control cycle) (P less than 0.01). The pregnancy wastage rates (including abortions and \"chemical\" pregnancies) were 30.6% in the treatment group versus 56% in the control group (P less than 0.01). We conclude that repetitive hCG administration may be an efficient luteal support in infertile patients undergoing ovulation induction.\r"

Nineteen patients with POF were studied with weekly measurements of serum FSH, LH, and E2 for five consecutive weeks. Nine patients (group I) showed episodic increases in E2 (greater than 50 pg/ml), seven accompanied by decreases in FSH, and an FSH/LH ratio that was periodically less than 1.0. Ten patients (group II) displayed persistent, nonvarying low E2 and high FSH and LH levels. There was no significant difference in the E2 response to high-dose hMG (48 to 100 ampules hMG/trial) in the two groups, all patients failing to respond. In conclusion, serial assays for FSH, LH, and E2 in patients with POF fail to predict ovarian responsiveness to a trial of high-dose hMG.\r"

All had associated thyroid autoimmune disorders (one with chronic thyroiditis and two with Graves' disease). Their major form of circulating prolactin (PRL) was in the large-molecular weight (150K) form (macroprolactinemia). Whereas normal serum content of 150K PRL is less than 10% of the total, these three patients had 150K PRL fractions of 97%, 96%, and 67%. The retention of normal menses and fertility of these subjects suggested that the 150K PRL had diminished biologic activity as patients with elevations of 22K PRL will have amenorrhea and infertility. Over time, the serum PRL levels of these three patients decreased with a coincident fall in the percentage of 150K PRL. Although serum thyroid concentrations usually influence serum PRL levels, no such effects were seen in these patients whether they were hypothyroid or hyperthyroid, neither was a causal relationship between the macroprolactinemia and autoimmune thyroid disease established. Macroprolactinemia cannot be considered to be a completely benign condition as occasionally it may be associated with infertility and osteopenia.\r"

The wave guide provided an effective laser delivery system for operative laparoscopy. The tested guide was introduced into the abdominal cavity alternatively via the operating channel of a 9-mm operating laparoscope, through the central channel of a smoke evacuation/irrigation cannula, or via a 3.25-mm second puncture trocar. In contrast to previously tested flexible guides, the rigid device transmitted a visible helium-neon aiming beam, power up to 50 watts, and a beam diameter of less than 1 mm. The hollow guide was kept free of smoke by-products by continuous purging with carbon dioxide gas flowing at 800 to 1000 cc per minute. All wave guides could be sterilized by ethylene oxide gas or Cidex (Surgikos, Arlington, TX) soaking. Fourteen women with a variety of reproductive disorders underwent laser laparoscopy. The rigid wave guide was fired at distances ranging from less than 1 mm to 30 mm from the target and performed with maximal impact at distances of 3 to 5 mm. Perhaps the greatest advantage of this system is its ability to focus-defocus while directly coupling to the handpiece of standard lasers and requiring no special alignment procedures.\r"

Mean number of preovulatory oocytes per retrieval and per transfer was significantly higher when the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-retrieval interval was greater than 35 hours, compared with less than 24 hours. In cycles with an hCG-retrieval interval of less than 24 hours, percentage of preovulatory oocytes was higher when serum estradiol (E2) decreased by greater than 15% on the morning after hCG administration compared with a plateau or an increase in serum E2. Timing oocyte retrieval after spontaneous LH surge should consider the hCG-retrieval interval and changes in E2 levels after hCG administration; this may avoid cancellation for many patients.\r"

The results of two methods of utilization of LH-RH agonists are compared. In the long protocol, gonadotropin stimulation was commenced only after a preliminary period of pituitary desensitization with LH-RH agonist. In the short protocol, exogenous gonadotropins were administered shortly after the start of LH-RH agonist therapy, benefiting from the gonadotropin flare up effect. One hundred eighty-six patients were equally divided between the two treatments. There was no difference in the ovarian response on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or the number of mature oocytes recovered. The cleavage rate of mature oocytes was higher in the short protocol (70% versus 56% P less than 0.01). The ongoing pregnancy rate per treatment cycle was similar in both groups (18% in the long protocol and 16% in the short protocol). Analysis of the luteal phases revealed a trend for higher progesterone values in the long protocol although this was only significant on the 2nd day following oocyte retrieval. As the clinical results were similar, other factors should be taken into account when deciding therapy. These include patient convenience, cost, and side effects. Other schedules of ovulation stimulation with LH-RH agonists are discussed.\r"

Consideration of this physiologic principle led to the introduction of pulsatile LH-RH therapy via infusion pump for the treatment of different forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. We report on 10 male patients, 16 to 28 years of age, suffering from idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) including Kallman's syndrome (n = 2) and delayed puberty (n = 2). All presented with complete eunuchoidism and had undergone no treatment for their conditions during the previous 2 years. LH-RH was administered in subcutaneous pulses of 4 to 16 micrograms, with a portable infusion pump (ZYKLOMAT, Ferring Corp., Kiel, FRG); treatment periods ranged from 6 to 24 months. With therapy, the subjects improved secretion of LH, FSH and testosterone. Testicular volumes and penis size increased; all patients developed normal secondary sexual characteristics. Spermatogenesis was induced in all patients. The time to onset of spermatogenesis ranged from 3 to 15 months. No major side effects were observed, and no patient dropped out of the study. The results indicate that pulsatile LH-RH therapy is an highly effective treatment for IHH and delayed puberty.\r"

This study examined the ability of five fixatives (glutaraldehyde, acetone, methanol, paraformaldehyde, and periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde [PLP]) and two conditions of slide preparation (air-drying or maintaining sperm in a liquid phase) to maintain the integrity of human spermatozoal membranes at the ultrastructural level as monitored by transmission electron microscopy. Regardless of the fixative employed, air-drying was detrimental to plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity. Acetone and methanol completely disrupted the plasma and acrosomal membranes over the entire sperm surface whether air-drying or liquid phase conditions were employed. Fixation with glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde (to a lesser degree) maintained the morphologic integrity of acrosomal and plasma membranes provided the sperm were maintained in a liquid phase. However, glutaraldehyde and paraformaldehyde fixation increased the postfixation binding of immunoglobulins to the sperm surface. We concluded that immunocytochemistry at the light microscopy level may imply erroneous interpretations regarding antigen/antibody interactions on the sperm plasma membrane surface unless care is taken to verify that the antibodies of interest are binding to the antigenically intact plasma or acrosomal membrane.\r"

A prostaglandin analogue given in early pregnancy and human chorionic gonadotropin given near the end of the ensuing follicular phase were used for controlling the reproductive cycle, timing oocyte collection, and synchronizing the cycles of oocyte donors and embryo recipients. Five embryos obtained by IVF were transferred at early stages to the uterus of three recipients, and two gave birth to live infants. Some of the embryos were cultured to advanced blastocyst stages. In vivo fertilized oocytes were also cultured and transferred to two recipients, and one gave birth. We concluded that the marmoset is one of the best primates for such investigations.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocyte lysosomes disassemble materials derived from intracellular sources, including lipid-containing membranes, by a process called autophagy. In addition, hepatocyte lysosomes can release their contents into bile by exocytosis. Therefore, using both in vivo and in vitro models, we tested the hypothesis that acute pharmacologic induction of autophagy would modify the biliary excretion of lysosomal protein and of lipids. We treated rats with a single dose of chloroquine (10 mg/kg), glucagon (1 mg/kg), or control solutions and collected bile via bile fistulas. Both chloroquine and glucagon immediately caused a marked and parallel decrease in biliary excretion of three lysosomal enzymes, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, beta-glucuronidase, and beta-galactosidase, to 25%-30% of baseline values (p less than 0.01). This decrease was sustained for 2 h after glucagon and 4 h after chloroquine administration. In contrast, biliary lipid changes were minor: a slight lowering of biliary cholesterol secretion after chloroquine (p less than 0.05), but no change in biliary bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipid secretion after glucagon. Changes in biliary excretion of lysosomal enzymes accompanying chloroquine and glucagon administration were associated with morphologic evidence of autophagy as assessed by electron microscopy and by increased fragility of hepatic lysosomes as assessed by latency of N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase. These in vivo changes in biliary lysosomal enzyme excretion induced by chloroquine and glucagon were confirmed in vitro using the isolated perfused rat liver. Thus, acute induction of autophagy results in conservation of hepatic lysosomal protein and has virtually no effect on biliary lipid excretion.\r"

Isolated rabbit antral and fundic mucosal explants incorporated [14C]N-acetylglucosamine and [3H]leucine in a linear fashion and steadily secreted labeled proteins and glycoproteins during the 24-h incubation period. On sepharose 4B, greater than 90% of the secreted protein-bound [14C]N-acetylglucosamine was found in the high molecular weight peak. Incorporation of tracer was not influenced by cyclooxygenase inhibition with indomethacin or the addition of exogenous prostaglandins. Secretion of newly formed glycoprotein, however, was significantly inhibited by indomethacin and stimulated by both tested prostaglandins in a concentration-dependent manner. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2 caused significant stimulation in concentrations that are well in the physiologic range for endogenous prostaglandin E2, whereas prostaglandin F2 alpha stimulated in 100 times higher concentrations. We conclude that in the isolated gastric mucosa both endogenous and exogenous prostaglandins stimulate mucus secretion. For prostaglandin E2, but not prostaglandin F2 alpha, a role in the physiologic regulation of gastric mucus secretion is probable.\r"

The level of circulating Na+-K+ pump inhibitor(s) was investigated in the spontaneously hypertensive rat of the Okamoto strain (SHR), its normotensive control, Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), and the regular Wistar rat using the following criteria: the ability of whole plasma to inhibit the total active Na+ efflux from Wistar rat erythrocytes and to cross-react with digoxin antibodies and the ability of plasma extracts to inhibit Na+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of membranes from rat kidney. SHR plasma inhibited the net Na+ efflux from Wistar erythrocytes by up to 27% compared with WKY or Wistar plasma. For a given number of cells, the inhibition increased with the amount of available plasma. Cross-reactivity with digoxin antibodies was twice as high in SHR as in WKY or Wistar plasma. It was already enhanced in 3- to 4-week-old rats. Plasma extracts from SHR significantly inhibited Na+,K+-ATPase activity when compared with WKY extracts (75.6 +/- 2.6 vs 89.3 +/- 2.4 mumol Pi/mg/hr; p less than 0.01) but did not differ from Wistar plasma extracts. These results strongly suggest that circulating digitalislike compound(s) are present in elevated amounts in SHR as early as 3 to 4 weeks of age, but their exact participation in blood pressure elevation or maintenance remains to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody to alpha-human atrial natriuretic polypeptide (alpha-hANP), KY-ANP-I, has been produced by fusion of a nonproducing mouse myeloma cell line, X63-Ag8.653, with spleen cells from BALB/c mice immunized with synthetic alpha-hANP conjugated to bovine thyroglobulin using the carbodiimide coupling procedure. Hybridomas were screened for antibody production by radioimmunoassay using culture media and 125I-alpha-hANP. They were cloned by the limiting dilution technique, expanded in culture, and injected intraperitoneally into BALB/c mice. The obtained antibody belonged to the immunoglobulin G1 subclass. Analysis by a Scatchard plot revealed a high affinity for alpha-hANP, with an association constant of 3.1 x 10(10) M-1. With this monoclonal antibody, a specific radioimmunoassay for alpha-hANP has been established. The antibody in mouse ascites was available for radioimmunoassay at a final dilution of 1:10(6). Values of IC10 and IC50 in this radioimmunoassay were 3 and 30 fmol/tube, respectively. The radioimmunoassay showed a cross-reactivity of 0.9% with alpha-rat ANP. alpha-hANP-(8-22) and alpha-ANP-(1-6) exhibited less cross-reactivity than alpha-rat ANP on a molar basis. There was no cross-reaction with alpha-ANP-(17-28). Thus, the recognized epitope must be located in the N-terminal half of the ring structure of alpha-hANP including Met12 residue. This radioimmunoassay could detect gamma-hANP and beta-hANP as well as alpha-hANP. The monoclonal antibody was also useful for immunohistochemical studies. ANP-positive cells were finely stained in the human atrium using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In contrast, ANF-(99-122), 10 micrograms/kg, significantly increased renal blood flow (26 +/- 4.5%), reduced renal vascular resistance (24 +/- 2.9%) and arterial pressure (5.5 +/- 1.9%), and markedly increased urine flow rate (198 +/- 34%) and sodium (206 +/- 32%) and potassium (75 +/- 27%) excretion (p less than 0.05), being almost twice as effective in the first 10 minutes as was ANF-(99-119) infusion.

However, few data are available regarding this putative hormone and its relationship to aldosterone, blood pressure, and vascular responsiveness to alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulation in primary aldosteronism, a volume-expanded, low-renin model of human hypertension. For this reason, the behavior of supine and upright plasma ANF as related to aldosterone, blood pressure, and forearm alpha-adrenergic sensitivity (plethysmographic technique) to intra-arterial norepinephrine infusion was studied in eight patients with primary aldosteronism (five with adenomas, three with hyperplasia) before and at the end of two sequential 1-week low (20 mmol/day) and high sodium (200 mmol/day) diet periods. Basal, predict ANF concentrations decreased and increased after low and high sodium intakes, respectively. Furthermore, highly significant postural ANF decrements after 1 hour of standing occurred with each diet, although they were lower after the low than after the high sodium diet. Plasma aldosterone, either supine or upright, was insensitive to dietary sodium manipulations, suggesting the absence of ANF-mediated control of aldosterone secretion in our patients. In spite of about twofold higher ANF concentrations during the high than during the low sodium diet, forearm vascular sensitivity to intra-arterial norepinephrine infusion did not change during the study. Furthermore, systemic arterial blood pressure rose to a highly significant extent after dietary sodium content was increased, thus casting doubt on a role for ANF as an endogenous long-term modulator of systemic blood pressure and peripheral alpha-adrenergic sensitivity in patients with primary aldosteronism.\r"

  ".W": "Using RIAs for the N- and C-terminal fragments of the human atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) precursor gamma ANP, that is gamma ANP-(1-25), and alpha ANP [gamma ANP-(99-126)], we studied the secretion of gamma ANP-derived peptides from the heart in normal subjects and patients with heart disease, chronic renal failure, and cirrhosis. We detected gamma ANP-(1-25)-like immunoreactivity (-LI) in plasma from normal subjects (n = 17) in considerable amounts [mean, 510 +/- 62 (+/- SE) pg/mL (174 +/- 21 pmol/L)]; the mean plasma alpha ANP-LI level at the same time in these subjects was 32.8 +/- 4.4 pg/mL (10.7 +/- 1.4 pmol/L). Gel permeation chromatographic analysis of plasma samples from normal subjects and patients with heart disease and chronic renal failure revealed two major components; one was alpha ANP, and the other was the 10K N-terminal gamma ANP fragment (N-peptide) resulting from the removal of alpha ANP (3K) from gamma ANP (13K). In addition, gamma ANP (13K), which possessed both gamma ANP-(1-25)-LI and alpha ANP-LI, and beta ANP, an antiparallel dimer of alpha ANP, were detected in some patients as minor components. A significant positive correlation between plasma levels of the N-terminal gamma ANP fragment and alpha ANP (P less than 0.01) and almost equal step-ups in the coronary sinus plasma levels of the N-terminal gamma ANP fragment and alpha ANP suggest that they are cosecreted in equimolar amounts. The high molar ratio of plasma gamma ANP-(1-25)-LI to alpha ANP-LI (17.4 +/- 1.4) in normal subjects and the significantly higher ratio in patients with chronic renal failure (36.9 +/- 7.1; P less than 0.01) suggest the slower clearance of the N-terminal gamma ANP fragment than alpha ANP and a role for the kidney in its degradation. Since the molar ratio of plasma gamma ANP-(1-25)-LI to alpha ANP-LI in patients with cirrhosis (20.7 +/- 2.7) was similar to that in normal subjects, it is unlikely that the N-terminal gamma ANP fragment is metabolized by the liver. In patients with heart disease, plasma gamma ANP-(1-25)-LI and alpha ANP-LI levels were higher in those with cardiac decompensation and were positively correlated with right atrial pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, indicating cosecretion of the N-terminal gamma ANP fragment and alpha ANP in response to atrial stretch.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The pattern and degree of variation in pituitary responsivity to GHRH was examined in four GH-deficient children (two boys and two girls, aged 4 3/12 to 10 4/12 yr). All children were studied before and on multiple (three to six per child) occasions during long term GHRH therapy (1 or 2 micrograms/kg, sc, every 3 h) in an identical fashion. Each study comprised withdrawal of blood for serum GH measurements every 20 min between 2000 and 0800 h. All subjects received GHRH at 2000, 2300, 0200, and 0500 h as well as at 0800, 1100, 1400, and 1700 h throughout the long term treatment period (6-18 months). Although all children had low level (less than 7.0 micrograms/L) pulsatile GH secretion during baseline studies, the maximal peak values occurred at times other than 0500 h. Before GHRH treatment, serum GH levels rose significantly in response to 91% (62 of 68) of the GHRH doses administered. GH pulse amplitudes varied throughout the studies in all children, and this variability persisted despite 1300-3600 consecutive doses in each child. In all 17 study periods the highest serum GH concentration occurred shortly after the 0500 h GHRH dose. The mean peak GH concentration after the 0500 h GHRH dose [18.4 +/- 3.5 (+/- SE) micrograms/L] was significantly higher than those after the 2000 h (5.3 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L; P = 0.0001), 2300 h (7.4 +/- 2.1 micrograms/L; P = 0.0003), and 0200 h (10.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/L; P = 0.011) doses. These results demonstrate that the responsivity of the pituitary to GHRH varies throughout the night in some GH-deficient children. There appears to be a direct relationship between the time of night and the degree of pituitary responsivity to GHRH. We suggest that this variable responsivity may be due to intermittent hypothalamic somatostatin secretion.\r"

Thirty-eight healthy men, 19 young (aged 22-35 yr) and 19 elderly (aged 65-85 yr), were studied before CC administration. The mean baseline serum inhibin level was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the elderly men than in the young men [416 +/- 22 (+/- SE) vs. 588 +/- 30 U/L], while serum immunoreactive FSH and LH levels were higher in the older men, and bioactive FSH levels were similar in the two age groups. Eleven young men and 13 elderly men were studied after 1 week of CC administration. The mean serum inhibin level increased by 71%, from 566 +/- 36 to 970 +/- 82 U/L, in the young men, but it increased by only 24%, from 421 +/- 26 to 520 +/- 38 U/L, in the elderly men. Serum immunoreactive LH and bioactive and immunoreactive FSH concentrations increased to similar levels in both groups after CC administration.

  ".W": "To determine the influence of estrogenic steroids on serum FSH bioactivity (B) and immunoreactivity (I) and the FSH isoform distribution profiles, we studied normal women during ovulatory menstrual cycles and a patient with gonadal dysgenesis treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES). Four women with ovulatory menstrual cycles, as judged from their serum immunoreactive LH, FSH, progesterone, and estradiol profiles in daily blood samples, had a significant increase in the mean FSH B/I ratio (P less than 0.05) during the midcycle phase of their menstrual cycles. Similarly, in the patient with gonadal dysgenesis the FSH B/I ratio rose significantly (P less than 0.05) after 3 weeks of DES treatment and declined during the posttreatment period. In five additional normal women, serum obtained during the follicular, midcycle, and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles was chromatofocused, and the FSH isoform distribution pattern determined. Sera obtained from the patient with gonadal dysgenesis before, during, and after DES administration were pooled and studied similarly. Chromatofocusing of a human pituitary tumor extract allowed for determination of the FSH B/I ratio in different pH ranges. The highest FSH B/I ratio was found in the more basic fractions (pH range 5.6-6.0) compared to the acidic fractions. During both the midcycle phase of the normal cycles and the DES administration period in the studies of the patient with gonadal dysgenesis, there was a shift of the FSH isoforms (as measured by immunoassay) to the basic pH range. In contrast, the mid- to late luteal phase samples, which had low B/I ratios, had an increase in FSH isoforms in the acidic pH range (less than 4.8). Similarly, in the patient with gonadal dysgenesis FSH isoforms in the basic range were more abundant during the DES treatment period than in the pre- or posttreatment serum pools. Therefore, it appears that endogenous and exogenous estrogenic stimulation alters FSH isoform distribution such that FSH isoforms that are more basic and have increased biological activity are secreted.\r"

  ".W": "Premature thelarche is a benign condition that affects young girls. In contrast, central precocious puberty is considered a more serious disorder that causes progressive secondary sexual development, accelerated growth and skeletal maturation, early epiphyseal fusion, and short adult stature. Differentiation between these 2 conditions is important, but may be difficult on clinical grounds, since patients with both disorders may present initially as isolated breast development. To examine the potential usefulness of gonadotropin measurements in distinguishing early central precocious puberty from premature thelarche, we measured basal and LHRH-stimulated plasma gonadotropin levels in 58 girls with idiopathic premature breast development. The girls were divided into six clinically distinct groups, based on the severity of clinical presentation, ranging from isolated breast development (group A) to complete secondary sexual development and accelerated growth and skeletal maturation (group F). The mean basal plasma LH levels and the peak LH response to LHRH stimulation were significantly less in girls with isolated thelarche (group A) than in girls with complete sexual development (group F). The mean basal plasma FSH levels did not differ between these groups, but the peak FSH response to LHRH was greater in girls with isolated thelarche than in girls with complete sexual development. Thus, girls with isolated premature thelarche had a FSH-predominant response to LHRH [mean ratio of peak LH to peak FSH, 0.29 +/- 0.10 (+/- SD)], while girls with complete sexual development had a LH-predominant response (peak LH/FSH, 4.16 +/- 1.80). All girls with isolated thelarche had peak LH/FSH ratios less than 1, and all girls with complete sexual development had a ratio greater than 1. Girls with early or intermediate manifestations of central precocious puberty, who had features of puberty in addition to breast development but lacked all of the features of group F, comprised groups B-E. These girls also had intermediate peak LH/FSH ratios, ranging from 0.29 +/- 0.10 (group B) to 3.35 +/- 2.66 (group E). We conclude that girls with early central precocious puberty frequently have LH and FSH responses to LHRH that are indistinguishable from the FSH-predominant responses of girls with isolated thelarche. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that premature thelarche and central precocious puberty may represent different positions along a continuum of hypothalamic LHRH neuron activation.\r"

  ".U": "88315250\r", 
  ".W": "The differential regulation of immunoactive FSH and LH secretion by endogenous GnRH was studied using a GnRH antagonist, [Ac-D2Nal1,D4FPhe2,DTrp3,DArg6]GnRH (the NAL-ARG antagonist), in normal women in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and their responses were compared to those in two groups of control women. Pulsatile LH secretion was examined as an index of the completeness of blockade of endogenous GnRH secretion. There was a dose-dependent decrease in both the frequency and amplitude of LH pulses. At the highest dose, LH pulses were completely abolished within 20 min after sc administration of the GnRH antagonist and for a minimum of 8 h in all women. The mean plasma LH levels were reduced within the first 4 h after antagonist administration at all doses (P less than 0.001). The duration of LH suppression was influenced by antagonist dose, with a continued effect 24 h after administration of the 500 micrograms/kg dose only. The maximum degree of LH suppression was 40% after 50 micrograms/kg (n = 6), 60% after 150 micrograms/kg (n = 6), and 59% after 500 micrograms/kg (n = 5). In contrast, plasma immunoreactive FSH levels did not change after these doses of the NAL-ARG GnRH antagonist. The maximum degree of FSH suppression was 16%, and the changes in plasma FSH concentrations were not dose dependent. Serum antagonist concentrations rose within 30 min after its administration to mean peak levels of 7.5 +/- 2.1 (+/- SE), 20.4 +/- 6.1, and 151 +/- 21 ng/mL after the 50, 150, and 500 micrograms/kg doses, respectively. The half-time of the disappearance of the NAL-ARG GnRH antagonist from plasma was 8.8 +/- 1.5 h. While there were no effects of antagonist administration on hematological, hepatic, or renal function, three women developed urticaria distant from the site of injection when administered the highest dose. We conclude that blockade of GnRH receptors by a GnRH antagonist 1) effectively antagonizes the action of GnRH, as assessed by its ability to block pulsatile LH secretion and reduce mean plasma LH levels; and 2) inhibits LH release to a considerably greater degree than FSH release, providing further evidence of possible GnRH-independent FSH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "This study explored whether atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) might be involved in the escape from salt and water retention that occurs in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). Sixteen patients with low serum Na+ concentrations [123 +/- 1 (+/- SE) mmol/L] were studied. Each patient excreted urine that was hyperosmolar (mean, 391 +/- 4 mosmol/kg) in relation to serum osmolality (mean, 258 +/- 4 mosmol/kg). Sodium excretion (81 +/- 20 mmol/L) also was inappropriate to the low serum Na+ level. The probable causes of SIADH were head trauma (4), pneumonia (5), lung cancer (3), and chlorpropamide therapy (4). In the nontumor patients, plasma and/or urinary vasopressin (AVP) concentrations were in the normal range, but inappropriate for serum osmolality. Urinary AVP values of 50 pg/mL or more (greater than 46 pmol/L) were found in the three tumor patients. The mean plasma ANH concentration was 6-fold higher than that in normal subjects [296 +/- 51 vs. 51 +/- 13 pg/mL (100 +/- 20 vs. 17 +/- 4 pmol/L); P less than 0.01]. Six SIADH patients were studied again after brief (1-3 days) water restriction. Although serum osmolality increased in each, their plasma AVP concentrations decreased very little, and urinary AVP excretion and plasma ANH did not change. These results indicate that plasma ANH levels are markedly increased in patients with SIADH. Their increased ANH secretion may antagonize water retention resulting from the inappropriate AVP secretion.\r"

  ".U": "88315259\r", 
  ".W": "We studied the role of the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated aldosterone secretion in normal and adenomatous human adrenal glomerulosa tissue. In freshly isolated normal adrenal glomerulosa cells, the AII-mediated stimulation of aldosterone secretion was not altered by cyclooxygenase blockade with ibuprofen. In contrast, BW755c (10(-5) mol/L), a nonselective lipoxygenase inhibitor, and baicalein (10(-6) mol/L), a more selective 12-lipoxygenase blocker, inhibited AII-mediated aldosterone secretion, but did not alter basal aldosterone secretion. The glomerulosa cells produced the lipoxygenase products 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) in the basal state, as measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and RIA. However, AII selectively stimulated only 12-HETE production [basal, 1329 +/- 207 (+/- SE) pg (3.99 +/- 0.62 pmol)/10(5) cells.h; AII, 2365 +/- 333 (7.09 +/- 1.0); n = 9; P less than 0.02], suggesting that 12-lipoxygenase activation may be involved in AII-mediated aldosterone secretion by normal cells. In addition, the lipoxygenase inhibitors that blocked AII-mediated aldosterone secretion also prevented AII-mediated 12-HETE formation. In contrast, neither ACTH nor K+ stimulated 12-HETE formation, suggesting that 12-lipoxygenase activation is primarily involved in AII action in normal glomerulosa cells. BW755c caused a marked dose-dependent inhibition of basal aldosterone secretion in freshly isolated cells from aldosterone-producing adenomas [APA; basal, 66 +/- 3 ng (182 +/- 8 pmol)/10(6) cells.h; 10(-5) mol/L BW755c, 49 +/- 2 (136 +/- 6); 10(-4) mol/L BW755c, 30 +/- 2 (83 +/- 6)]. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor U60257 did not alter basal aldosterone secretion by these cells. The APA cells produced 12- and 15-HETE, and BW755c at the same dose that inhibited aldosterone secretion also inhibited the production of both 12- and 15-HETE. In the cultured APA cells, AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion was inhibited by BW755c [basal, 26 +/- 8 pg/mL (72.0 +/- 22.1 pmol/L); AII, 336 +/- 79 (930 +/- 218); AII plus BW755c, 92 +/- 38 (255 +/- 105) n = 13; P less than 0.01]. The lipoxygenase products 12- and 15-HETE restored the stimulatory effect of AII during inhibition by BW755c, indicating a role for these lipoxygenase pathways in AII-mediated aldosterone secretion in APA cells. These results suggest that the stimulatory effects of AII on aldosterone secretion are mediated by stimulation of the lipoxygenase pathway in human zona glomerulosa cells.\r"

Anti-TAP antibodies can stimulate T cells directly and also synergize with Ag stimulation. To determine the relationship between TAP and TCR-mediated activation, we have derived TCR/CD3 loss variants of functional T hybrid clones. T-T hybrid variants that have lost TCR expression are not responsive to anti-TAP stimulation. Isolation and analysis of revertant clones, obtained from one of the TCR/CD3-negative mutant cell lines, demonstrate a concordant re-expression of the TCR/CD3 complex and responsiveness to anti-TAP stimulation. A similar loss of responsiveness to TAP stimulation is observed after antibody-induced modulation of the TCR/CD3 complex from the surface of T cell hybrids. In contrast, both the TCR/CD3 loss variants and TCR/CD3-modulated T-T hybrids remain fully responsive to stimulation with a calcium ionophore and phorbol esters. This structure-function correlation has been observed repeatedly in independent isolations of variants, and with TCR/CD3 modulated cells, from two different T-T hybridomas. Given the apparent functional interrelationship between TAP and the TCR/CD3 complex, we have also analyzed if these molecules were significantly associated on the T cell surface. Antibody-induced modulation of the TCR/CD3 complex does not affect the cell surface expression of TAP molecules. Moreover, the expression of these two sets of proteins is also independent as evidenced by the selective loss of either set of these proteins in the TCR/CD3 expression mutants.\r"

  ".W": "Murine peritoneal macrophages were cultured with heat-killed Listeria monocytogenes organisms and then with the protein hen egg white lysozyme. Hen egg lysozyme is well known to need intracellular processing for presentation to T cells. The presentation to T cells of lysozyme was affected despite no reduction in the amount taken up or catabolized by the macrophage. This interference with Ag presentation was not found if the macrophages were cultured with lysozyme before the Listeria pulse. The interference with Ag presentation induced by Listeria was found for a second Ag (conalbumin). Uptake of Listeria did not affect the presentation of the lysozyme peptide 46-61, indicating that MHC class II molecules were available at the macrophage surface. Other materials that are retained in the macrophages affected presentation of lysozyme but not of the processed peptide. These included SRBC, dextran, sucrose, cellobiose, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sodium dextran sulfate, Ficoll, and polyethylene glycol. Except for SRBC, which were not tested, the remaining molecules did not interfere with presentation of 46-61 by formaldehyde-fixed macrophages, an indication that they did not affect the peptide interaction with class II molecules. Finally, uptake of latex beads did not affect presentation of lysozyme. We conclude that retention in the macrophage of a variety of soluble or particulate molecules can interfere with the intracellular events that result in the creation of an immunogenic determinant. This interference is independent of the catabolism of the Ag or of the availability of class II molecules to bind peptides.\r"

In contrast, for increased IL-1 activity, GM-CSF synergized weakly and irregularly with LPS, but not at all with IFN-gamma. For the third monocyte product investigated, GM-CSF was a weak and inconsistent inducer of PGE2 and only in the co-presence of IFN-gamma. Thus, GM-CSF can elicit different responses in human monocytes depending both on the co-stimulus as well as the monocyte product being investigated.\r"

TFN-alpha beta, TFN-alpha, IL-1, either alone or in combination with LPS or IFN-gamma, had no effect on macrophage procoagulant activity expression. In contrast to the dramatic increases of macrophage procoagulant activity induced by IFN-gamma/LPS, on exudate macrophages, normal peritoneal macrophages, or peripheral blood monocytes were unresponsive suggesting that the state of activation of the macrophage determines reactivity. IFN-gamma induced a Factor VIIa-like activity detected only after cell disruption. Synergy between LPS and IFN-gamma-induced procoagulants may occur as the result of the assembly of the thromboplastin (induced by LPS), Factor VII/VIIa complex on the macrophage surface. RNA synthesis was required for procoagulant induction. Procoagulant expression may, as for other cytokines involved in inflammatory responses, be regulated by short lived repressor proteins as low dose cycloheximide superinduced procoagulant responses to both LPS and IFN-gamma and caused the extracellular expression of procoagulant in response to IFN-gamma. This study suggests an important role for IFN-gamma in the assembly of components of the extrinsic coagulant cascade on the macrophage surface. The synergy between IFN-gamma and LPS may moderate macrophage-initiated fibrin deposition characteristic of inflammatory responses.\r"

To test the hypothesis that alterations in the rate of Ia gene transcription were responsible for these changes in steady-state levels, nuclear \"run on\" transcription experiments were performed.

The 12-kbp EcoRI fragment was cloned and shown to contain two C lambda region-encoding genes in the same orientation. Each is preceded by a J lambda gene segment. Nonamer-12-bp spacer-heptamer recombination signal sequences were found 5' of each J lambda segment, and splicing signals were identified at the 3' ends of the J lambda segments and the 5' ends of the corresponding C lambda genes. The C lambda 5 gene, which exhibits a sequence identical with that found in several cDNA clones, is carried by the 2-kbp BamHI fragment missing from the genomic DNA of rabbits which do not express the C21 allotype. The second C lambda gene, C lambda 6, lies 3' of C lambda 5, in a 1.6-kbp BamHI fragment which is present in genomic DNAs of all tested rabbits, irrespective of their phenotype. Its sequence is identical with that found in one cDNA clone and differs from that of C lambda 5 in 17 base positions resulting in four amino acid substitutions. A fragment of a cDNA, with a J-C region sequence identical with that encoded by the J lambda 5-C lambda 5 gene pair, was subcloned into a plasmid expression vector. The resulting polypeptide product could be specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-C21 but not anti-C7 alloantisera, showing that some, if not all, C21 allotopes are encoded by the C lambda 5 gene. In contrast, the C lambda 6 gene product was not precipitable, either by anti-C7 or by anti-C21 alloantisera, although it was readily immunoprecipitated by a goat anti-rabbit lambda chain antiserum.\r"

No well defined differences were observed between the Hermes-1 Ag immunoprecipitated from PBL and from mucosa- vs lymph HEV-specific cell lines. The Ag is an acidic (isoelectric point = 4.2) sulfated molecule bearing both O-linked and (3,4) N-linked oligosaccharide side chains. A subset of the Hermes-1-immunoprecipitated species is modified by covalent linkage to chondroitin sulfate, yielding a Mr of approximately 180 to 200 kDa. Pulse-chase labeling reveals a major precursor of 76 kDa that appears to be processed either to the 85- to 95-kDa form or, by addition of chondroitin sulfate, to a 180- to 200-kDa form. The potential role of these structural modifications, and particularly of chondroitin sulfate, in the function of the putative adhesion molecules is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The human pre-monocytic cell line U-937 was shown to synthesize and to secrete increasing amounts of factor B in short term cultures in serum-free medium containing BSA. The kinetics of factor B production were higher on day 2 than on days 1 and 3. The production of factor B was reversibly inhibited by cycloheximide, indicating de novo synthesis. Metabolic labeling with [35S]-methionine and SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that both intracellular and secreted factor B were single-chain proteins with similar m.w. (90,000), which co-migrated with purified plasma factor B. Incubation of U-937 cells with the immunostimulants PMA, LPS, IFN-gamma, and IL-1 resulted in a dose-dependent augmentation of factor B production. A 24-h exposure to IL-1 was shown to be required for maximal stimulation. A combination of suboptimal doses of LPS and IFN-gamma was shown to exert a synergistic effect on factor B production. The U-937 cell line is thus a valuable model for the study of the regulation of the factor B gene expression.\r"

The induction of ICAM-1 by these cytokines was neutralized by cytokine-specific antisera as well as some steroids and the glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin. Cyclohexamide up-regulated the expression of ICAM-1 on chondrosarcoma cells but had little or no effect on carcinoma cells.

Three synthetic peptides, derived from the primary sequence of the recombinant P28 and comprising amino acids 24-43, 115-131, and 140-153, respectively, were synthesized according to their hydrophilicity, mobility, and accessibility profiles. The presence of B and T lymphocyte epitopes in these peptides has been examined in the rat model. The results showed that the 24-43 and the 115-131 peptides contained major epitopes for IgG but not for IgE. Moreover, the 24-43 peptide-specific IgG produced after injecting either the recombinant P28 Ag or the 24-43 peptide coupled to tetanus toxoid was essentially of the IgG2a subclass and to a lesser extent of the IgG1 subclass, whereas no IgG2c was detected. These 24-43 peptide-specific antibodies were cytotoxic in vitro for schistosomula in the presence of eosinophils as effector cells. The 24-43 and the 140-153 peptides contained major targets of T lymphocytes specific for the recombinant P28 Ag. T cell lines specific for the 24-43 peptide have been prepared. These cells proliferated in vitro when stimulated with various S. mansoni crude antigenic preparations or with the recombinant P28 Ag. Moreover, their passive transfer to rats immunized with the P28 Ag led to a significant increase in specific IgE without modifying the IgG response.\r"

  ".W": "Components of current vaccines for Hansen's disease include Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and killed Mycobacterium leprae. BCG infections in humans are rare and most often occur in immune-compromised individuals. M. leprae on the other hand, although not causing clinical disease in most exposed individuals, is capable of infecting and replicating within mononuclear phagocytes. Lymphocytes from patients with the lepromatous form of Hansen's disease exhibit defective lymphokine production when challenged in vitro with M. leprae. This may result in inefficient mononuclear phagocyte activation for oxidative killing. To study the ability of normal phagocytes to ingest and respond oxidatively to BCG and M. leprae, we measured phagocytic cell O2- release and fluorescent oxidative product formation and visually confirmed the ingestion of the organisms. BCG stimulated a vigorous O2- generation in neutrophils and monocytes and flow cytometric oxidative product generation by neutrophils occurred in the majority of cells. M. leprae, stimulated a weak but significant O2- release requiring a high concentration of organisms and long exposure. By flow cytometric analysis, most neutrophils were able to respond to both organisms with the generation of fluorescent oxidative products. Neutrophil oxidative responses to M. leprae were substantially less than responses seen from neutrophils exposed to BCG. By microscopic examination of neutrophils phagocytizing FITC-labeled bacteria, it was shown that both M. leprae and BCG were slowly ingested but that more BCG appeared to be associated with the cell membrane of more of the cells. When phagocytic cells were incubated with BCG and M. leprae for 30 min and subsequently examined by electron microscopy, few organisms were seen in either neutrophils or monocytes. This suggests that BCG are easily recognized and slowly ingested by normal phagocytic cells, the majority of which respond with a strong oxidative burst. M. leprae appeared to only weakly stimulate phagocyte oxidative responses and were also slowly phagocytized.\r"

Major polypeptides with m.w. around 17,000 (P17) and one minor polypeptide with m.w. 18,000 (P18) that had HBeAg activity were consistently detected in 12 different serum samples by immunoblotting analysis. To examine the polypeptide composition of HBeAg/1 and HBeAg/2, precipitin lines of HBeAg/1-anti-HBeAg/1 and HBeAg/2-anti-HBeAg/2 were separately cut from the agarose gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. HBeAg/1 and HBeAg/2 showed similar P17 and P18 compositions. Monomeric forms of P17 and P18 in a solution of 0.1% SDS showed HBeAg/1 activity, whereas polymeric forms of these polypeptides showed HBeAg/2 activity. The stability of HBeAg subspecificities to SDS and 2-ME was examined. When HBeAg was incubated in a buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1% 2-ME, only the HBeAg/2 precipitin line disappeared in agarose gel concurrently with the conversion of HBeAg molecules to a monomeric from a polymeric form. In contrast, neither monomerization nor the disappearance of HBeAg/2 was seen when SDS or 2-ME was used by itself. These results indicate that hydrophobic forces and disulfide bonds may be involved in the association of P17 and P18 in serum and that HBeAg/2 activity depends upon association of HBeAg-polypeptides but that HBeAg/1 activity does not. The possibility that the epitopes of HBeAg/2 are specific for the conformation of polymerized molecules is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "These studies define certain T cell-dependent regulatory factors that modulate granulomatous hypersensitivity in Schistosoma mansoni. Lyt-2+ and IJ+ T cells produce a suppressor effector factor (TseF) that bears both an IJ determinant and an antigenically specific receptor. TseF suppresses in vitro and in vivo granulomatous hypersensitivity and demonstrates both antigenic and genetic restriction. This factor binds to the mAb 14-12 but not 14-30 suggesting that it also bears a specific suppressor effector phenotypic marker. Factor production is abrogated by the addition of exogenous IL-2; however, the activity of preformed TseF is not affected by IL-2. Initial characterization studies have suggested that TseF is a non-Ig protein and that it is composed of two chains that can be separated by dithiothreitol reduction. These chains can complement each other by in vitro reconstitution of reactivity. One chain bears the IJ phenotype. The other chain bears the Ag-R. Thus it would appear that this TseF bears strong structural homologies to those previously ascribed to T cell-R. These studies provide preliminary information on the molecules that are responsible for the specific modulation of granulomatous hypersensitivity in schistosomiasis.\r"

Anti-idiotypic responses were stimulated by immunization of mice with lymphoblasts, bearing specific idiotypic receptors. These receptors were produced in vitro by stimulation of Ag-reactive T cells by soluble cercarial immunogen, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or Con A. The animals were then exposed to irradiated cercariae, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or SRBC. The results indicate that the soluble cercarial immunogen lymphoblast recipient mice demonstrated reduction in a number of parameters of their immune response to schistosome Ag, including resistance to challenge by parasites. These changes were immunologically specific. Anti-idiotypic antibodies and anti-clonotypic T cell reactivity was demonstrated in the lymphoblast immunized mice. The suppression of reactivity in LBM was mediated by Lyt-1-, L3T-4-, and Lyt-2+ lymphocytes. These studies suggest that idiotypically dependent pathways might be important for the regulation of resistance to schistosomiasis.\r"

This kappa allele had undergone an effective V-J rearrangement. Extensive somatic mutation focused about the V-J region created a sequence that was only 75% homologous to its germ-line counterpart. Altered acceptor (V kappa) and donor (J kappa) splice sites resulted in an aberrant splice between the leader and C kappa exons and a truncated 850-bp kappa mRNA.

The abnormal RIV serum Ig consisted of shortened, dimeric gamma 1-chains which had an amino terminus within the hinge region. RIV lymphoblasts possessed a foreshortened (1200 bp) gamma 1-mRNA which had sequences for only the leader, hinge, second, and third constant region domains (CH2 + CH3), but lacked variable (VH) and CH1 information. Sequence of the productive gamma 1 allele revealed it had undergone VH-JH and H chain class switch recombinations. However, normal RNA splice sites had been eliminated by a DNA insertion/deletion (VH acceptor site), mutations (JH donor site), or a large deletion (CH1 region). Inserted sequences were of non-Ig and apparently non-genomic origin. These DNA alterations resulted in aberrant mRNA processing in which the leader region was spliced directly to the hinge region, accounting for the HCD protein.\r"

Recent studies have shown that antibodies recognize epitopes present in the noncollagenous carboxyl-terminal domain of type VII collagen, a BMZ matrix protein. Antibodies with identical specificity also have been detected in patients with the rare blistering disease, bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (bullous SLE), suggesting EBA and bullous SLE are immunologically related diseases. In this study we determined the major histo-compatibility antigen types of 29 EBA patients and 6 patients with bullous SLE. Analysis of the results showed HLA-DR2 was significantly increased in both black EBA patients, P = 0.013 (corrected, RR = 4.8) and white EBA patients, P = 0.0008 (corrected, RR = 13.1). Five of the six bullous SLE patients also were positive for the DR2 antigen, P = 0.009.

Nevertheless, we found 35 P.IA/P.IB recombinants among 1506 transformants. Transmission by DNA of the hybrid reactivities and the apparent molecular mass characteristic of a given P.IA/P.IB species verified the genetic basis of the phenotypic changes. A recombinant that expressed six P.IA and two P.IB epitopes is of interest as a possible component of a gonococcal vaccine, because one or more of these epitopes are shared with 99.8% of a worldwide collection of 1858 clinical strains.\r"

Reduced uptake of ciprofloxacin was seen in one isolate and may have contributed to its ciprofloxacin resistance but was not associated with alterations in outer or cytoplasmic membrane proteins, a result suggesting that such changes are not required to decrease uptake of fluoroquinolones into cells. No evidence for plasmid-mediated resistance was found, and no ciprofloxacin-inactivating activity was detected in sonic extracts of resistant organisms. In these isolates, resistance to ciprofloxacin was likely the result of more than one mutation, because single-step mutations conferring such high-level resistance were not found in the parent strain.\r"

  ".W": "We found an in vitro postantibiotic effect (PAE) of 3-4 h for imipenem and of approximately 5 h for imipenem plus gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We therefore evaluated these antibiotics in a rat model of pseudomonas endocarditis. A rapid bactericidal effect was initially observed in vegetations from rats treated with imipenem alone or in combination with gentamicin. Bacterial counts rose rapidly, however, as soon as levels of imipenem in vegetations fell below the minimal inhibitory concentration (i.e., no PAE was demonstrated). Levels of gentamicin in vegetations were similar to those that had enhanced the bactericidal effect of imipenem and had resulted in a 5-h PAE in vitro. The presence in vitro of a PAE for imipenem, with or without gentamicin, does not necessarily predict its presence in vivo in pseudomonas endocarditis in the rat.\r"

To identify possible stimuli for this neovascularization, we evaluated parasite-derived products for their ability to activate endothelial cells in vitro. Soluble egg antigen (SEA) of S. mansoni at concentrations as low as 30 ng/mL induced a marked proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVE) that increased in a dose-dependent fashion; equivalent effects were seen with bovine adrenal and murine lung endothelial cells. Live, intact S. mansoni eggs secreted a soluble factor that stimulated HUVE in a manner similar to crude SEA. In contrast, adult worm extracts of S. mansoni had no significant effect on endothelial cell proliferation in any of the three cell lines tested. Preliminary biochemical characterization showed the activity to be protease sensitive and heat stable. S. mansoni SEA, in the absence of inflammatory cells, can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation in vitro.\r"

The allele frequencies were determined and the extent of linkage disequilibrium among the polymorphisms was assessed. In contrast to intragenic RFLPs of the factor IX gene, intragenic and extragenic RFLPs of the factor VIII gene in Japanese were similar to those observed in whites.

Although the levels of arachidonic acid metabolites via 5-lipoxygenase pathway by stimulated polymorphonuclear cells were comparable between patients and controls, mononuclear leukocytes from patients synthesized, when stimulated, significantly greater amounts of 5-HETE, LTB4, and LTC4 than did cells isolated from normal subjects. In addition, the release of superoxide anion, stimulated by either a particulate or a soluble stimulus, was increased in mononuclear cells from patients. The enhanced capacity of peripheral mononuclear leukocytes isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis to generate proinflammatory metabolites of arachidonic acid and oxygenated species with bactericidal and tissue-damaging properties may contribute to the pathogenesis of this complex disease.\r"

Among 51 tumor sites 201TI imaging had a detection rate of 45% whereas 84% was noted for imaging with 131I administered in therapeutic doses. Thus, even though the effectiveness of the two radionuclides is not strictly comparable due to the difference in the administered doses, Thallium imaging cannot be recommended as the only modality for the follow-up of patients with DTC. Six of the eight tumor sites negative with 131I were positive with 201TI (especially metastatic cervico-mediastinal lymph nodes). So 201TI imaging may particularly be helpful in localizing metastases or recurrences in patients with a negative 131I scan and abnormal levels of serum thyroglobulin.\r"

All tumor images were FDG-positive before treatment. After RT, a decrement of tumor FDG uptake was found in all but two patients; these were nonradioresponders. There was a significant decrement (p less than 0.001) in uptake ratios after irradiation of 30 +/- 5 Gy among the radioresponsive (CR + PR) but not among the radioresistant (NC + PD) tumors. The administered dose of RT correlated (r = 0.47, p less than 0.05) with the decrement in FDG activity among the CR + PR but not among the NC + PD patients. The biologic half-life of FDG radioactivity in tumor tissue was evaluated by dynamic scintigraphy. A change in the half-life of FDG toward the value observed in normal tissue was associated with treatment response. The results suggest that FDG imaging can be used for follow-up of RT in patients with head and neck cancer.\r"

The short-lived (9.3 min) tantalum-178 (178Ta) is ideally suited for the MWGC and can be produced from long-lived (21.7 day) tungsten-178 (178W) by a previously reported 178W/178Ta generator. This generator, however, is limited by sharp increase in breakthrough after elution of only 30-60 column-volumes. To optimize the 178W/178Ta generator for clinical use, varying eluant acid concentrations were evaluated. A reduced (from 0.1 to 0.03N) HCI concentration in the eluant, coupled with low operating temperatures (3 to 5 degrees C) allowed high (40 to 60%) 178Ta yield. Minimal 178W breakthrough (less than .01%) resulted, even after elution of more than 200 column-volumes. Each of six tested generators provided sterile, high activity (up to 100 mCi) 178Ta elutions for more than 30 days. Radiation dosimetry was estimated utilizing both human and animal biodistribution data. The whole body (critical organ) dose in adults and neonates were 1/20 (1/21) and 1/19 (1/50) respectively relative to that of technetium-99m (99mTc) as sodium pertechnetate. The optimized 178W/178Ta generator provides a commercially practical, safe source of low-energy radioisotope for the MWGC with substantial dosimetry advantages over 99mTc.\r"

Baseline measurements were obtained with hyperventilation to PaCO2 20 to 30 mm Hg (pH 7.56 +/- 0.01 mm Hg). The addition of carbon dioxide to inspired gas to achieve a PaCO2 40 to 45 mm Hg (pH 7.35 +/- 0.01) resulted in a significant increase in MPAP, from 32 +/- 5 mm Hg to 47 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). An increase in mean cardiac index (CI) from 2.7 +/- 0.3 L/min/m2 to 3.3 +/- 0.3 L/min/m2 (p less than 0.05) explained in part the associated increase in MPAP. For a subgroup of eight patients with postoperative MPAP greater than 30 mm Hg (at pH 7.35 to 7.40), pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) also significantly increased (p less than 0.05) as PaCO2 was increased, implying a direct pulmonary vasodilating effect of alkalosis. Removal of carbon dioxide from inspired gas returned hemodynamic values to baseline. The higher the MPAP at physiologic pH the greater the absolute amount of MPAP reduction and PVRI reduction (p less than 0.05) with alkalosis. No complications from alkalosis were seen. We suggest that a trial of hypocarbic alkalosis in the child with severe residual pulmonary hypertension after surgical repair of congenital heart disease is warranted to reduce right ventricular afterload.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effect of small enteral feedings on small bowel function, 46 infants with birth weight less than 1500 g, selected on the basis of risk factors for feeding intolerance, were assigned randomly to one of two feeding groups. Group 1 received low-volume enteral feeds (12 ml/kg/day) in addition to parenteral alimentation for 10 days beginning on day 8 of life; group 2 received parenteral alimentation alone until day 18 of life. After this trial period feedings were increased by 15 ml/kg/day in all infants. Four infants (9%) developed necrotizing enterocolitis (one prior to any feeds, two in group 1, and one in group 2); two others were dropped from the study for reasons unrelated to feeding. The remaining 18 infants in group 1 had improved feeding tolerance compared with the 22 in group 2, as manifested by fewer days that gastric residuum totalled more than 10% of feedings (1.3 +/- 0.5 days vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 days, respectively, p less than 0.05) and fewer days that feedings were discontinued because of feeding intolerance (2.7 +/- 0.8 days vs 5.5 +/- 0.9 days, respectively, p less than 0.05). Consequently, 17 of 18 (94%) infants who had received the early low-volume enteral feedings achieved an enteral intake of 120 kcal/kg/day by 6 weeks of life, whereas only 14 of 22 (64%) infants in the delayed feeding group reached this intake (p less than 0.05). Peak total serum bilirubin concentrations were comparable in the two groups. The initiation of hypocaloric enteral substrate as an adjunct to parenteral nutrition improved subsequent feeding tolerance in sick infants with very low birth weight.\r"

When the proportion of iron [25 microM Fe(III)] to Adr was 1:4, almost 50% of the metal was reduced following 1 hour of anaerobic reaction, while only approximately equal to 14% of the bound iron could be extracted as Fe(II) in the reactions of the Dnr complexes. The reaction of Adr was associated with formation of two main novel anthracyclines. One of the products had lost the C14 atom of the C9 chain and displayed chromatographic features and visible UV light spectra identical to those of authentic 9-dehydroxyacetyl-9-carboxyl-Adr. In complexes of iron and Dnr, no significant anthracycline degradation was observed. Reduction of anthracycline-bound Fe(III) by 4'-epi-Adr (38%) and 3'-N-acetyl-Adr (21.2%) was consistently less than that by Adr. Complexes of the anthracyclines investigated had different abilities to sustain lipid peroxidation, which was blocked (a) by the iron chelators deferoxamine and bathophenanthroline, indicating that Fe(III) and Fe(II) were needed for the reaction, and (b) by ICRF-198, the chelating product that forms intracellularly by hydrolysis of razoxane, which can prevent Adr cardiotoxicity. Peroxidation was not affected by scavengers of reduced oxygen radicals (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and mannitol). The isolated membranes contributed to the reduction of anthracycline-bound Fe(III) and probably represented the main determinant of lipid peroxidation by iron-Dnr. Lipid peroxidation was significantly less for complexes of iron with 4'-epi-Adr or 3'-N-acetyl-Adr than for complexes of iron with Adr. The observed differences may be relevant to the different biologic properties of Adr and its analogs, in particular their different degrees of cardiotoxicity.\r"
