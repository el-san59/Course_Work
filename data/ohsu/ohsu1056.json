  ".W": "Artifacts are encountered daily in clinical sonography. They may be observed in B-mode gray-scale imaging, spectral pulsed Doppler imaging, and color Doppler imaging. Most of these distortions can be understood at a basic level by an appreciation of the form of the focused sound beam, the interaction of sound with tissue, and assumptions made about the spatial assignment of reflected echoes. Sonographic systems assign depth based on the time interval of round-trip echo travel and assume a straight line and singular path from transducer to reflector and reflector to transducer. The same speed of sound is assumed in all tissues for the purposes of spatial assignment. Some inherent acoustic artifacts are used reflexively to characterize tissue. Strong acoustic enhancement behind an anechoic structure confirms the diagnosis of a cyst. Clean acoustic shadowing distal to an echogenic focus in the gallbladder leads us to the diagnosis of gallstones. If unrecognized, acoustic artifacts can cause serious misdiagnoses. Several commonly encountered artifacts are illustrated, with a basic physical explanation of their occurrence.\r"

Solids leave the stomach more slowly than liquids, and conditions causing gastroparesis affect solids before liquids. Gastric mucosal abnormalities and their treatment can affect GE. Diseases of the gastric musculature, including the inflammatory and endocrine myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and infiltrative disorders, can result in significant gastroparesis. Acute and chronic neuropathy may both affect gastric emptying. The latter neuropathies are now the subject of intense investigation with new prokinetic drugs. Finally, abnormal GE may be a major clinical feature of certain severe psychiatric disorders.\r"

The methotrexate dose averaged 15 mg/wk (0.2 mg/kg/wk). All six patients who were symptomatic became asymptomatic within 1-5 months of starting methotrexate. Biochemical tests of liver function improved in all patients. The alkaline phosphatase value decreased from a mean (+/-SD) of 373 +/- 210 IU to 140 +/- 77 IU (p = 0.0008), the mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from 115 +/- 74 to 76 +/- 79 U/L (p = 0.005), and the mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value from 88 +/- 37 to 57 +/- 40 U/L (p = 0.007). The improvement in mean bilirubin (1.19 +/- 1.41 to 0.67 +/- 0.25 mg/dl) was not statistically significant. Serum albumin remained normal (3.97 +/- 0.46 to 4.22 +/- 0.36 g/dl). Nine patients had a repeat liver biopsy after 1 yr of methotrexate therapy. Six of the nine showed histologic improvement with a reduction in inflammation. The other three liver biopsies were unchanged. Repeat cholangiograms were done in six patients. Two showed improvement. In one of the two, who had early disease, the cholangiogram became normal, and the liver biopsy was markedly improved. The other four cholangiograms showed no progression of disease. No toxicity was detected in these 10 patients. These results suggest that low-dose oral methotrexate therapy is effective in primary sclerosing cholangitis if treatment is begun before signs of portal hypertension or liver failure occur.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the occurrence of alcoholic autonomic dysfunction in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in order to define its prevalence and relationship to renal sodium retention. Forty-seven alcoholics and 16 age-matched normal subjects were evaluated. Thirty-seven patients had liver disease (13 with and 24 without ascites), and 10 patients had normal hepatic function. Autonomic nervous system function was ascertained by skin sudomotor responses and the response of blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine concentration to upright tilt (sympathetic nervous system function), and by heart rate responses to deep breathing, Valsalva maneuver, and upright tilt (parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system function). Heart rate responses to deep breathing and Valsalva maneuver were diminished, and skin sudomotor responses were significantly worse, in alcoholics than in control subjects. Alcoholic patients also had significantly lower supine mean arterial pressure (93 +/- 10 vs. 116 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.0001), and significantly greater increases in arterial pressure during passive upright tilt, than control subjects (mean increase 6.5 +/- 6.6 vs. 0.1 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p = 0.0003). All of these findings were present to similar degrees in patients with and without liver disease and in cirrhotic patients with and without ascites. Supine heart rates, however, differed among the groups evaluated. Heart rate was significantly greater in patients with cirrhosis than in alcoholic patients without liver disease (83 +/- 11 vs. 71 +/- 13 bpm, p = 0.006), and in patients with ascites than in patients without ascites (88 +/- 12 vs. 80 +/- 10 bpm, p = 0.04). Plasma norepinephrine concentration was elevated in most patients with cirrhosis and was significantly higher in patients with ascites than in patients without ascites (789 +/- 238 vs. 388 +/- 185 pg/ml, p less than 0.0001; nl range: 65-320 pg/ml). Autonomic nervous system function is similarly impaired in alcoholics with and without liver disease. Patients with cirrhosis also have increased heart rate and elevated plasma norepinephrine concentration, abnormalities that are most pronounced in patients with sodium retention. Their is uncertainty as to the stimulus for norepinephrine release, and its source, in these patients. However, the similarity of supine blood pressure in patients with and without ascites and the occurrence of orthostatic hypertension rather than orthostatic hypotension following upright tilt suggest that arterial underfilling is not responsible.\r"

Alcoholics, homosexuals, drug abusers, immunocompromised patients, and those with advanced liver disease were excluded. During the follow-up, 25 patients (54%) cleared HBeAg and became seronegative for HBV-DNAp. The estimated annual rate of seroconversion was 26%. One patient cleared HBsAg. After seroconversion, 18 patients had no evidence of ongoing liver disease, proved by biopsy in eight and by clinical follow-up in 10 that refused biopsy. A second liver biopsy was available in 15 patients, and HBcAg was negative in all; histology was normal in eight, unchanged in one, and compatible with cirrhosis in six. All six had clinical and/or biochemical evidence of advanced liver disease. These were significantly older at the start of the study, and had chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis on initial biopsy. Early identification of patients with silent chronic HBV infection and high levels of viral replication for antiviral therapy could prevent transmission of the infection and stop progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

We followed serum ALT and HBV DNA determinations. There was no difference in the demographic characteristics of the three groups. Group 1 had significantly lower levels of circulating T4 lymphocytes. We found no differences in the number and severity of episodes of HBV reactivation, serum ALT levels, or HBV DNA scores among the three groups. In each group, the percentage of patients with circulating HBV DNA was the same. We conclude that HIV infection apparently does not influence the markers of liver inflammation or HBV replication in homosexual men.\r"

When appropriate, the cellular debris on stents that were removed from individuals who were managed with these devices was evaluated for malignant cells as well. Our aim was to assess the value of these endoscopic cytotechniques for making a diagnosis of obstructing cancer of the biliary tract. A cumulative total of 78 specimens were obtained. Overall, sensitivity was highest for stent (36%) and brush (33%) cytology, compared with results obtained from bile (6%). If the results for all methods are combined, 47% of patients with cancer (eight of 17) could be diagnosed by one or more cytological technique. There were no false-positive results (specificity, 100%). Our results show that brush and stent cytology are nearly equivalent for detecting cancer, but because a diagnosis is delayed until the endoprosthesis is removed (mean 3.4 months), the brush technique is preferred. Results for bile cytology are marginal. Specificity for these cytotechniques is high; therefore, a positive result by any method is sufficient evidence for cancer, and other invasive diagnostic procedures are unnecessary.\r"

  ".W": "Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been postulated as a neuropeptide with inhibitory neurotransmitter activity in nonadrenergic noncholinergic pathways. Transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter in patients with achalasia. Such response is accompanied by a 30% increase in VIP concentrations in the systemic circulation. Since the sphincter of Oddi (SO) receives a very dense VIP nerve supply, we evaluate the effect of TENS on SO motor activity and on VIP plasma concentrations in patients with biliary dyskinesia and in healthy volunteers. TENS was performed with a pocket stimulator for 45 min. SO pressure and VIP levels were obtained before and after 45 min of TENS. In patients with SO dyskinesia, TENS produced a significant decrease in SO pressure from 80.1 +/- 11.9 mm Hg to 58.3 +/- 9.7 mm Hg p less than 0.01); this was accompanied by a significant increase in VIP plasma levels from 21.1 +/- 0.5 pg/ml to 32.6 +/- 1.5 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). In healthy volunteers, TENS did not produce significant changes in SO pressure. However, a significant increase in VIP plasma values was observed (p less than 0.01). No significant changes in amplitude, duration and frequency of SO phasic contractions were observed in either of the two groups evaluated. We conclude that, in patients with SO dyskinesia, TENS decreases SO basal pressure, possibly by a direct action of the released VIP in the systemic circulation. In healthy volunteers, TENS increases VIP plasma values without significant effect on SO basal pressure. These findings suggest that the response to TENS may be mediated by VIP. It is also possible that the alterations seen in patients with biliary dyskinesia may be due to impairment of the VIP nerve supply at the level of the SO.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) when patients are classified by this system. Two hundred and thirteen patients with pancreaticobiliary pain were evaluated clinically; SOM, ERCP, and ductal contrast drainage time tests were performed. For biliary types I, II, and III, the frequency of abnormal SOM was 85.7%, 55.1%, and 28.1%, respectively. Similarly, for pancreatic types I, II, and III, an elevated basal sphincter pressure occurred in 92.3%, 58.2%, and 35.1%, respectively. When patients with an abnormal basal sphincter pressure were characterized by the magnitude of the elevation, the manometric profiles were similar for types I, II, and III. These data suggest that elevated sphincter pressure occurs more frequently in type III patients than previously reported, and supports consideration of SOM when evaluating and treating type II and type III patients.\r"

Specificity of the T:DHT ratio was 98%, significantly better than the specificity of CA 19-9 at both a 37 U/ml cutoff level (61%) and at 100 U/ml (79%). Sensitivity of the T:DHT ratio was 67%, and that of CA 19-9, 71% and 90% at the upper and lower cutoff levels, respectively. False-negative results of the T:DHT ratio were found predominantly in cases of advanced pancreatic cancer, whereas all four stage I patients had an abnormal (less than 5) T:DHT ratio. These results suggest that the T:DHT ratio is a useful marker for pancreatic cancer in males. It can be used alone or in combination with CA 19-9, and should be further evaluated in the differential diagnosis of patients with the early stages of this disease.\r"

Forty-three patients were included in the study. Pseudocystic fluid content was obtained by percutaneous aspiration. Twenty-four patients had pseudocyst amylase concentrations above 64 Wolgemuth units (WU), and 19 patients had less than 64 WU. The communication between pseudocyst and the pancreatic duct was determined in 22 patients by ERCP and in 13 patients by PCP, all in the group with increased pseudocyst amylase concentration. Due to high sensitivity and specificity of pseudocyst amylase concentration for the existence of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct, we conclude that guided percutaneous aspiration of the pancreatic pseudocyst with the determination of amylase concentration in the fluid can replace ERCP as a method of choice for the detection of pseudocyst communication with the pancreatic duct.\r"

Areas of gas bubbles were measured with a computer digitizing board. Bowel gas was also measured in 24 healthy controls, and in five emergency room patients, supine and erect radiographs were compared to evaluate the effects of position on bowel gas patterns. The two evaluators agreed well on the measured areas of bowel gas (r = 0.96), showing that this is a reliable method. Bowel gas was significantly greater in patients than in controls but did not correlate with symptoms. Bowel gas was significantly greater in supine than upright films, showing that the position of the patient must be standardized.\r"

A negative test for H. pylori in a patient with duodenal ulcer would raise a pretest probability for ZE of 10-20% to a posttest range of 61-78%. The information provided by a negative test result with respect to ZE is greater in younger than in older ulcer patients. It is also greater in duodenal than gastric ulcer. We conclude that testing for H. pylori in ulcer patients, in whom ZE constitutes a possible differential diagnosis, adds substantially to the decision making at relatively low cost and little additional risk to the patient.\r"

We reviewed 500 consecutive manometric studies from a 3-yr period to determine the prevalence of this manometric finding, its association with other motility abnormalities, and the clinical outcome of subjects without associated aperistalsis (i.e., without achalasia). We identified 60 subjects with incomplete lower sphincter relaxation, 17 of whom had at least some normal peristalsis (3.4% of the total). Mean lower sphincter residual pressure for these 17 subjects (4.5 +/- 2.8 mm Hg) was intermediate between those with achalasia (11.7 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) and those with normal relaxation (0.1 +/- 0.2 mm Hg). Both peristaltic and contraction abnormalities in the esophageal body were prevalent in the 17 subjects compared with those who had normal relaxation. Outcome with conservative medical therapy after a mean follow-up of 3.3 yr was not significantly related to presence of peristaltic or contraction abnormalities at presentation, and 71% of subjects with or without these concomitant findings had improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. Only one subject worsened and was treated with pneumatic dilation. We conclude that incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter without aperistalsis is uncommon, symptom regression occurs with conservative therapy, and pneumatic dilation appears rarely required over a modest follow-up period.\r"

Subsequent EUS showed a solid high-echoic mass occupying the third (submucosal) and fourth (muscularis propria) layers of gastric wall, suggestive of an advanced cancer invading the muscularis propria. However, histologic examination of the surgical specimen showed that this tumor was early submucosal carcinoma confined to the surface of a pancreatic rest. Retrospective evaluation of EUS pictures proved that the mass had tubular or circular echoless structures associated with thickening of the fourth layer, suggesting the pancreatic rest. Our experience in reviewing EUS findings of this tumor seems noteworthy, inasmuch as EUS indicates that EUS may provide certain characteristic features of gastric pancreatic rest that should be differentiated from invading carcinoma.\r"

A 60-yr-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and nausea. Upper gastrointestinal tract examination demonstrated backflow of contrast medium from the duodenal bulb into the gallbladder. Endoscopic examination revealed a large fistula on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, and two brown stones (about 3 cm in diameter) were found in the stomach. To prevent gallstone ileus, removal of these stones was attempted. They were broken into pieces by EEHL, then crushed into smaller pieces by EML and removed orally. Chemical analysis showed the composition of the gallstones to be at least 98% cholesterol. The patient was discharged one month after removal of the gallstones and has remained asymptomatic.\r"

Although clinical features were suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism, his parathyroid hormone level was not elevated. The patient underwent a radical resection of the pancreatic neoplasm which was situated in the tail of the gland. After surgery, the serum calcium fell within the normal range, suggesting that the tumor was responsible for production of a parathyroid hormone-like substance. Because of malignant histologic features of the lesion, a chemotherapeutic regimen including 5-fluorouracil and streptozotocin was indicated. Five years later, the tumor has remained in total remission.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty patients with systemic sclerosis, Raynaud's phenomenon (19 of 20 patients), and clinically normal cardiac function underwent right heart catheterization. Rest and exercise hemodynamic measurements, including cardiac output by thermodilution, were performed before and after oral administration of nifedipine 20 mg and captopril 25 mg. RESULTS: Half of the patients had normal hemodynamics (Group A); the other half (Group B) had abnormal baseline elevations in pulmonary vascular resistance and four of them showed \"borderline\" pulmonary arterial hypertension. Group A, with significantly shorter disease duration compared with Group B, responded poorly to nifedipine and captopril. However, Group B had significant decreases in pulmonary vascular resistance (from 148 +/- 20 to normal levels of 94 +/- 21 dynes.second.cm-5) and pulmonary mean pressure in response to nifedipine treatment but not to captopril. CONCLUSION: These observations show a short-term beneficial effect of nifedipine in the cardiopulmonary vasculature of patients with systemic sclerosis and suggest that a potentially reversible vasoconstrictive element is included in the vascular lesion of this disorder.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined clinical characteristics predictive of severe disease in 6,435 consecutive symptomatic patients referred for suspected coronary artery disease between 1969 and 1983. RESULTS: Eleven of 23 characteristics were important for estimating the likelihood of severe coronary artery disease. A model using these characteristics accurately estimated the likelihood of severe disease in an independent sample of 2,342 patients referred since 1983. The model also accurately estimated the prevalence of severe disease in large series of patients reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the clinician's initial evaluation can identify patients at high or low risk of anatomically severe coronary artery disease. Cost-conscious quality care is encouraged by identifying patients at higher risk for severe coronary artery disease who are most likely to benefit from further evaluation.\r"

  ".U": "91229111\r", 
  ".W": "PURPOSE: This study assessed the usefulness of thallium stress testing as a predictor of perioperative cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing cadaveric renal transplantation. Demographic factors influencing the exercise performance in these patients were also examined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 189 consecutive patients with diabetic nephropathy who were evaluated for cadaveric renal transplantation were reviewed. Thallium stress testing was the initial examination of cardiovascular status in 141 patients. An adequate examination was one in which at least 70% of maximum heart rate was achieved. A thallium stress test was normal if there were no ST segment depressions on the electrocardiogram and no perfusion abnormalities on the thallium scan. Forty-four patients underwent cardiac catheterization as the initial evaluation (Group C) and four patients underwent transplantation without a formal cardiovascular evaluation (Group D). RESULTS: Sixty-four of the 141 patients undergoing thallium stress testing had an adequate and normal examination (Group A). The incidence of perioperative cardiac events in this group was 2%. Seventy-seven patients (Group B) had an abnormal (n = 41) or an inadequate (n = 36) thallium stress test and most (n = 61) then underwent coronary angiography. The use of beta-blockers was the only predictor of an abnormal or inadequate thallium stress test (10 of 64 versus 27 of 77, chi 2 = 6.66, p less than or equal to 0.025). Forty-three percent (26 of 61 in Group B) of patients with inadequate or abnormal thallium stress tests had significant coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. The perioperative risk of cardiac events was not different in Group A versus Groups B, C, and D combined. Survival of Group A and B patients was not different but was significantly longer than that of Group C patients (p less than 0.001). Thallium stress testing was less expensive than cardiac catheterization ($1,000 versus $4,000 to $5,000). CONCLUSIONS: Thallium stress testing allowed 45% of patients to avoid cardiac catheterization before renal transplantation. Discontinuing beta-blockers before thallium stress tests may improve exercise performance. The risk of perioperative cardiac events after transplantation was low and not different among patient groups. The relatively low predictive value of thallium stress testing for significant coronary artery disease and perioperative cardiac events in diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease suggests the need for the development of a more cost-effective, noninvasive screening test for this patient population.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether the administration of acetylsalicylic acid has adverse effects on renal function in patients with moderate chronic congestive heart failure with and without stimulation of the renin system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: Group 1, low sodium diet and placebo; Group 2, low sodium diet and acetylsalicylic acid; Group 3, normal sodium diet and placebo; or Group 4, normal sodium diet and acetylsalicylic acid. Patients were studied over 8 days. After Day 5, patients in Groups 2 and 4 received acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg three times a day). The low sodium diet consisted of 13.6 mmol of sodium per day and the normal sodium diet consisted of 136 mmol of sodium per day. RESULTS: The low sodium diet resulted in a highly significant increase in the plasma renin (2p = 0.0001), aldosterone (2p = 0.0006), and urinary prostaglandin E2 (2p = 0.01) concentrations and the renal potassium excretion (2p = 0.0009), whereas renal sodium excretion was significantly reduced (2p = 0.0001). Severe sodium depletion led to a reduction of the glomerular filtration rate (2p = 0.007), which was independent from cyclooxygenase inhibition. In patients on the low sodium diet, acetylsalicylic acid reduced the elevated urinary prostaglandin E2 levels to normal values without changing the renal sodium excretion rate. In patients with a normal sodium intake, acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced the renal sodium excretion rate by 29% (2p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: We conclude that severe sodium depletion has adverse effects on kidney function in patients with heart failure due to a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid in doses that reduce the synthesis of renal prostaglandin E2 significantly reduces renal sodium excretion.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic capabilities of traditional esophageal tests (manometry and provocative testing with acid and edrophonium) and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring in identifying an esophageal cause of chest pain. DESIGN: A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients referred by cardiologists to the esophageal laboratory for evaluation of esophageal causes of chest pain. SETTING: Tertiary-referral university hospital. METHODS: Esophageal manometry performed with 10 wet swallows of water. Acid perfusion (0.1 N hydrochloric acid) and edrophonium (80 micrograms/kg intravenously) tests were placebo-controlled with a positive study defined as replication of typical chest pain. Esophageal pH monitoring identified (1) abnormal acid exposure times in the upright, supine, or combined position, and (2) correlation between symptoms and acid reflux, i.e., symptom index. The esophagus was identified as \"probably\" contributing to chest pain only if the acid or edrophonium test was positive or if there was a positive correlation between symptoms and acid reflux during pH monitoring. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry was abnormal in 32 patients (32%), but patients were asymptomatic during the study. The acid perfusion test was positive in 18 of 95 patients (19%), and the edrophonium test was positive in 15 of 78 patients (19%). Abnormal acid exposure times were found in 48 patients (48%). Of the 83 patients with spontaneous chest pain during 24-hour pH testing, 37 patients (46%) had abnormal reflux parameters and 50 patients (60%) had a positive symptom index (mean positive score 56%, range 6% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Acid reflux is a common and potentially treatable cause of noncardiac chest pain. Traditional esophageal tests usually miss this diagnosis. Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring with symptom correlation is the single best test for evaluating patients with noncardiac chest pain.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Skin disease is the most common clinically important manifestation of onchocerciasis. Ivermectin, a newly available drug, is well tolerated and effective in Onchocerca volvulus infection. However, little information is available regarding its effect on onchocercal skin disease. The purpose of this study was to examine, in patients with well-characterized onchodermatitis, the effect of a single dose of ivermectin. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one persons with severe onchodermatitis were followed over a 6-month period. In order to evaluate the effect of ivermectin on their skin lesions, photographic transparencies were made before treatment and at 3 and 6 months after treatment. These were then evaluated in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Following a single dose of 150 micrograms/kg, there was a significant improvement in dermatitis in the first 3 months after treatment. All 14 persons with the worst skin disease showed improvement. The drug had no demonstrable effect on depigmented lesions over the period of observation. Treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Single-dose ivermectin shows promise as the first acceptable treatment for severe onchocercal dermatitis.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: We describe the manifestations of spontaneous staphylococcal pyomyositis in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We present the courses of five previously unreported patients infected by HIV who presented to our medical centers with spontaneous staphylococcal pyomyositis. Additionally, we review all previously reported cases of this entity in HIV-infected patients and discuss its possible pathogenesis and importance in the context of HIV infection. RESULTS: All patients presented with gradually developing fever and localized pain and swelling without accompanying leukocytosis. Often only scant evidence of local inflammation was found. None of our patients used intravenous drugs, had a history of trauma, had HIV- or zidovudine-related myositis, or had other conditions known to be associated with serious staphylococcal infections. Two patients studied had normal serum levels of all IgG subclasses. Elevated serum IgE, eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrates, or marked peripheral eosinophilia was observed in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcal pyomyositis in HIV-infected patients presents in an indolent fashion, which may delay appropriate diagnosis and treatment. Since staphylococcal pyomyositis is infrequently reported in the United States, the development of 14 such cases (five in this series and nine previously reported) among the first 140,000 cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in this country implies that this patient population is predisposed to this infectious complication. The pathogenesis of this entity is uncertain, but it is notable that HIV-infected patients are commonly colonized by Staphylococcus aureus and that neutrophils from HIV-infected patients frequently manifest phagocytic, chemotactic, and oxidative defects, diminished expression of Fc tau RIII (CD16) and CR1, and impaired bactericidal activity against S. aureus.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prescribing practices for the use of psychoactive medication in treating hospitalized patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical charts were studied for all patients admitted to a 20-bed AIDS inpatient ward from July through December 1986. One hundred and fifty-one patient-admissions comprised the sample. The average age of the patients was 37 years, and the average length of the hospital stay was 13 days. Retrospective chart review collected demographic data, length of stay, medical diagnosis, psychiatric history, and mental status on admission. Data on psychoactive drugs included the reasons for use, maximum daily dose and duration, and side effects ascribed to the drugs. RESULTS: Psychoactive drugs were used in 89% of the cases. Anxiolytics accounted for 49% of the psychoactive prescriptions, and hypnotics made up 43% of these prescriptions. The five most frequently used psychoactive drugs were benzodiazepines. The most frequent reasons for psychotropic prescriptions were insomnia (39%), psychologic distress (20%), and nausea (16%). The most frequently used anxiolytic and anti-psychotic medications were used in moderate dosage, while the most frequently used antidepressant was prescribed in low dosage. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized AIDS patients are highly likely to be prescribed a psychotropic medication, especially an anxiolytic or hypnotic. Anxiolytics are used for several purposes, including reduction of nausea associated with the use of antibiotics. Antidepressants and antipsychotics are rarely used. Practitioners must be sensitive to the presence of psychiatric conditions presenting as insomnia or disturbed mood so that the most specific and appropriate treatments can be used.\r"

  ".W": "The Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by: (1) at least a single sebaceous gland tumor (either an adenoma, an epithelioma, or a carcinoma) and (2) a minimum of one internal malignancy. To date, 120 patients with MTS have been reported. The most commonly associated neoplasms were colorectal (51%) and genitourinary (25%). Unlike colorectal neoplasms in the general population, the majority (58%) of these tumors in MTS patients occurred proximal to or at the splenic flexure. Nearly half of the MTS patients had more than one primary malignancy. Cutaneous lesions occurred before or concurrent with the diagnosis of the initial cancer in 41% of these patients. The median age for the appearance of the skin lesions was 53 years (range, 23 to 89 years); the median age for the detection of the initial visceral neoplasm was 50 years (range, 23 to 81 years). The cancers appear to have an indolent course in many of the MTS patients; the median survival has not been reached and the median follow-up is 10+ years. Patients with an MTS-associated cutaneous lesion should have a complete evaluation for gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers. Although the penetrance of this disease is variable, its autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that relatives should be examined for sebaceous gland tumors and internal malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this voluntary multicenter study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and the risk of nosocomial transmission of HIV in hemodialysis patients in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In June 1986, we began collecting epidemiologic data, risk factor information, and serum for HIV antibody testing from long-term hemodialysis patients on entry into the study and 1 year later. RESULTS: Initial data and specimens were collected from 1,324 patients in 28 dialysis centers in 12 states. On entry, 26 were positive or equivocal by enzyme immunoassay; 13 of these were positive by Western blot assay (overall seroprevalence 0.98%). Seroprevalence was higher for patients tested in eight centers located in areas from which a high cumulative incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome has been reported (500 or more cases per 1 million persons) than for patients in other areas (10 of 387 [2.6%] versus three of 937 [0.3%]; p = 0.00048). According to their dialysis records, all 13 of the Western blot-positive patients had received transfusions. Seropositive patients were not more likely to have received a transfusion than seronegative patients (13 of 13 versus 1,038 of 1,311; p = 0.08). The confidential risk factor questionnaire was completed by 1,206 (91%) patients including nine of 13 (69%) of the seropositive patients. A question on sharing needles for injection of drugs was answered by 1,158 patients; seropositive patients were more likely to report they had shared needles than seronegative patients (five of nine versus 17 of 1,149; p = 0.0000002). After 1 year of follow-up, data were collected from 667 patients, including 254 negative patients who underwent dialysis at centers with seropositive patients. None of the previously seronegative patients seroconverted, yielding an incidence rate of 0% (upper limit of 95% confidence interval = 0.45%). No case of possible nosocomial transmission was identified. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that use of long-standing infection control precautions is effective minimizing the risk of transmission of HIV in hemodialysis settings.\r"

LP-X is separated in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) density range, but lacks apolipoprotein B and does not interact with the LDL receptor; LP-X can cause hyperlipidemia, cutaneous xanthomas, and worsening of arterial disease. We report the case of a patient with severe cholestasis, markedly elevated plasma cholesterol levels (26.8 to 31.5 mmol/L), mainly due to a massive accumulation of LP-X in plasma, and diffuse xanthomas. To reduce the elevated cholesterol levels, the patient was given extracorporeal treatment aimed at removing atherogenic lipoprotein (LDL-apheresis). LDL-apheresis was performed at weekly or bi-weekly intervals, either by a semi-selective technique using filters with a defined pore diameter (double filtration, DF) or by a more selective technique using dextran-sulfate-cellulose (DSC) columns able to bind LDL. The semi-selective DF technique proved more effective than DSC, removing 48% of total cholesterol (compared to 30% with DSC), and lowering cholesterol levels to 11.1 mmol/L in 6 weeks. DF removed both LDL and LP-X from plasma, whereas DSC selectively decreased the LDL content. The reduction of plasma cholesterol levels was associated with a complete regression of the xanthomas, supporting DF apheresis as a first-choice treatment for patients with massive LP-X accumulation due to cholestasis.\r"

Presented herein is a case of POEMS syndrome with flushing. The flushing was intermittent, involving the face and upper third of the trunk, and was associated with hypotension and bronchospasm. Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like flushing. The flushing improved with steroid therapy, as did some of the other clinical features of her disease. This case suggests that idiopathic flushing can be added to the skin changes observed in POEMS syndrome.\r"

METHODS: This article uses interviews and written materials to document and describe the state of affairs that led up to community tension over an occupational exposure to a bladder carcinogen. The article describes the planning and design of a program to provide medical surveillance to workers, which also alleviated community concern. RESULTS: The Drake Chemical Workers' Health Registry coped successfully with community conflict and obtained a high participation rate. CONCLUSIONS: General recommendations include the following: avoid identification with extraneous agendas; know the community and maintain communication; and match the intervention to the evolution of the community conflict.\r"

This study investigates whether acidic aerosols and other air pollutants are associated with respiratory symptoms in free-living asthmatics. METHODS: Daily concentrations of hydrogen ion (H+), nitric acid, fine particulates, sulfates and nitrates were obtained during an intensive air monitoring effort in Denver, Colorado, in the winter of 1987-88. A panel of 207 asthmatics recorded respiratory symptoms, frequency of medication use, and related information in daily diaries. We used a multiple regression time-series model to analyze which air pollutants, if any, were associated with health outcomes reported by study participants. RESULTS: Airborne H+ was found to be significantly associated with several indicators of asthma status, including moderate or severe cough and shortness of breath. Cough was also associated with fine particulates, and shortness of breath with sulfates. Incorporating the participants' time spent outside and exercise intensity into the daily measure of exposure strengthened the association between these pollutants and asthmatic symptoms. Nitric acid and nitrates were not significantly associated with any respiratory symptom analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: In this population of asthmatics, several outdoor air pollutants, particularly airborne acidity, were associated with daily respiratory symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: This project directly and empirically measured the level of gastrointestinal (GI) illness related to the consumption of tapwater prepared from sewage-contaminated surface waters and meeting current water quality criteria. METHODS: A randomized intervention trial was carried out; 299 eligible households were supplied with domestic water filters (reverse-osmosis) that eliminate microbial and chemical contaminants from their water, and 307 households were left with their usual tapwater without a filter. The GI symptomatology was evaluated by means of a family health diary maintained prospectively by all study families over a 15-month period. RESULTS: The estimated annual incidence of GI illness was 0.76 among tapwater drinkers compared with 0.50 among filtered water drinkers (p less than 0.01). These findings were consistently observed in all population subgroups. CONCLUSION: It is estimated that 35% of the reported GI illnesses among the tapwater drinkers were water-related and preventable. Our results raise questions about the adequacy of current standards of drinking water quality to prevent water-borne endemic gastrointestinal illness.\r"

The Safe Drinking Water Act has mandated control of this pathogen. METHODS: A risk assessment model was developed to estimate risk of infection after exposure to treated waters containing varying levels of Giardia cysts. The model was defined by a dose-response curve developed from human feeding studies for Giardia and assumed 2L of water consumption per day. Data on concentrations and distribution of the organism in source waters were used to assess exposure after varying reductions achieved through treatment. RESULTS: In surveys reporting prevalence and levels of Giardia cyst contamination, average levels of cysts in surface waters ranged from 0.33 to 104/100L; from pristine watersheds (protected from all human activity) 0.6 to 5/100L. Yearly risks were 4.8 x 10(-3) for systems using polluted waters and 1.3 x 10(-4) for pristine waters with a 10(-3) treatment reduction. CONCLUSION: Public Health officials will need to work with the water industry to ensure a risk of less than 1/10,000 for source waters with 0.7 to 70 cysts per 100 liters through treatment achieving reduction of 10(-3) to 10(-5), respectively, of Giardia cysts.\r"

METHODS: Twenty-two school properties and recreational areas within a Lyme disease endemic area of central Monmouth County, New Jersey were evaluated for risk of transmission using an ecological index on the suitability, amount, and access to Ixodes dammini habitat by target human populations and the abundance of infected adult ticks. RESULTS: The characterization of tick habitat accurately predicted the elimination of 11 sites from concern. Of the remaining 11 sites, six were classified high risk and five as moderate risk. On-site tick surveys identified infected I. dammini adults at only four sites (three risk; one moderate risk). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the use of selected ecological parameters provides a cost-effective method to rapidly identify areas at risk for Lyme disease transmission.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: In the light of a possible link between stress and cancer promotion or progression, and of previously reported distress in residents near the Three Mile Island (TMI) nuclear power plant, we attempted to evaluate the impact of the March 1979 accident on community cancer rates. METHODS: Proximity of residence to the plant, which related to distress in previous studies, was taken as a possible indicator of accident stress; the postaccident pattern in cancer rates was examined in 69 \"study tracts\" within a 10-mile radius of TMI, in relation to residential proximity. RESULTS: A modest association was found between postaccident cancer rates and proximity (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.3, 1.6). After adjusting for a gradient in cancer risk prior to the accident, the odds ratio contrasting those closest to the plant with those living farther out was 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.4). A postaccident increase in cancer rates near the Three Mile Island plant was notable in 1982, persisted for another year, and then declined. Radiation emissions, as modeled mathematically, did not account for the observed increase. CONCLUSION: Interpretation in terms of accident stress is limited by the lack of an individual measure of stress and by uncertainty about whether stress has a biological effect on cancer in humans. An alternative mechanism for the cancer increase near the plant is through changes in care-seeking and diagnostic practice arising from postaccident concern.\r"

  ".U": "91229144\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND: The complete and accurate identification of fatal occupational injuries among the US work force is an important first step in developing work injury prevention efforts. Numerous sources of information, such as death certificates, Workers' Compensation files, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) files, medical examiner records, state health and labor department reports, and various combinations of these, have been used to identify cases of work-related fatal injuries. Recent studies have questioned the effectiveness of these sources for identifying such cases. METHODS: At least 10 studies have used multiple sources to define the universe of fatal work injuries within a state and to determine the capture rates, or proportion of the universe identified, by each source. Results of these studies, which are not all available in published literature, are summarized here in a format that allows researchers to readily compare the ascertainment capabilities of the sources. RESULTS: The overall average capture rates of sources were as follows: death certificates, 81%; medical examiner records, 61%; Workers' Compensation reports, 57%; and OSHA reports 32%. Variations by state and value added through the use of multiple sources are presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis of 10 state-based studies summarizes the effectiveness of various source documents for capturing cases of fatal occupational injuries to help researchers make informed decisions when designing occupational injury surveillance systems.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND: Women, while noted for low occupational injury mortality rates, are more likely to die as victims of assault than from any other manner of injury at work. METHODS: From the National Traumatic Occupational Fatality surveillance data, 950 women were identified who were fatally assaulted at work. Homicide rates were calculated for the demographic and employment characteristics of these women. Risk ratios among types of lethal injuries were examined. RESULTS: During 1980-1985, the crude six-year workplace homicide rate was 4.0 deaths per million working women: one twentieth the homicide rate of the US female population. Decedents ranged from 16 years (the lowest age included in the data base) to 93 years of age. Working women older than 65 years had the highest age-specific homicide rate, 11.3 per million. Women younger than 20 had the lowest, 2.5 per million per year. Homicide rates for women of races other than White were nearly twice as high as those of Whites. The leading causes of death were gunshot wounds (64 percent), stabbings (19 percent), asphyxiations (7 percent), and blunt force trauma (6 percent). Nearly 43 percent of the deceased women had been employed in retail trade: 8.7 per million employed women annually. CONCLUSIONS: During 1980-1985, only 6 percent of the nation's victims of work-related injury deaths were female: 41 percent of those women were murdered. Homicide is currently the leading manner of traumatic workplace death among women in the United States.\r"

METHODS: To describe the occurrence of fatal motor vehicle crashes in the working-age population, a case-control study was conducted among persons 15-64 years old who died in 1986 or 1987 in any of 20 states reporting death certificate occupational data to the National Center for Health Statistics. Cases were occupants of motor vehicles (excluding motorcycles) who died of injuries sustained in a crash (E810-E825, 9th revision International Classification of Diseases), and controls died of any other cause. RESULTS: Transportation-related occupations had more than the expected number of deaths for men (odds ratio = 1.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.4-1.9) and women (odds ratio = 2.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.0-4.5), as did managerial occupations (odds ratio = 1.3 and 1.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-1.5 and 1.3-2.2 for men and women, respectively). Men in mining and oil drilling occupations and the wholesale trade industry also had excess crash deaths. Among women, additional excesses were observed among professional specialists and in several groups with few deaths, including agriculture, construction, and the military, whereas homemakers had markedly fewer vehicle crash deaths than expected. CONCLUSIONS: These findings encourage further investigation of this important safety hazard, but also call attention to a need for more detailed studies and improved data.\r"

METHODS: An analysis was conducted of 10,190 blood lead samples from employees of 10 high-risk workplaces collected in Manitoba, 1979-87, as part of regulated occupational surveillance. RESULTS: A significant decrease in blood lead concentrations was observed overall as well as for each individual company. A 1979 government regulation to reduce blood lead to below 3.38 mumol/L (70 micrograms/dl) was followed by a drop in blood lead concentrations; a 1983 order to reduce blood leads to below 2.90 mumol/L (60 micrograms/dl) was not followed by such a drop. Longitudinal analysis by individual workers suggested that companies were complying by use of administrative control, i.e., removing workers to lower lead areas until blood lead levels had fallen, then returning them to high lead areas. CONCLUSION: Focusing upon blood lead as the sole criterion for compliance is not effective; regulations must specifically require environmental monitoring and controls. Biological surveillance serves as \"back-up\" to environmental surveillance and this database illustrates the usefulness of a comprehensive centralized surveillance system.\r"

Case files from 1988 reporting pesticide exposure to humans were identified in cooperation with the Minnesota Center for Health Statistics. Data analysis was conducted by computer using SAS statistical package. Of the 1,428 case files indicating pesticide as the primary substance of exposure to Minnesota residents, a mean age of 5 years (range, one month to 85 years) was identified; 50 percent of all cases were below age 3 years. Males accounted for 1.3 times as many cases as females. Insecticide was identified in the largest percentage of case files (74 percent) followed by herbicide (12 percent), rodenticide (11 percent) and fungicide-nonmedicinal (3 percent). Ingestion was the most common route of exposure; 85 percent of all calls originated from a residence. While insecticides are still the most common types of pesticide call, herbicide has surpassed insecticide in production and sales in the US. In this study, herbicide type exposure calls present a much different picture than other pesticide types. The usefulness of poison control centers for examination of pesticide poisoning is explored. Since reporting occurs coincidental with the exposure and its associated symptoms, each pesticide poisoning report could potentially serve as a true sentinel health event.\r"

Further, lead and other metals painted on food packaging of any type becomes part of the municipal waste stream subject to incineration and to land-filling. The use of lead in packaging presents an unnecessary risk to public health.\r"

Thus, one self-reported question can provide useful information about who is and who is not participating in regular exercise. The potential validity of a single exercise question is particularly relevant in complex epidemiologic studies where lengthy questionnaires highlight the importance of brief instruments.\r"

The union used the hearings of the US Anthracite Coal Strike Commission of 1902-3 to draw public attention to \"miners' asthma.\" In 1915, it began to agitate for the provision of workers' compensation benefits for victims of this disorder. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the union's Welfare and Retirement Fund disseminated information on advances in understanding chronic pulmonary diseases of mining. In particular, the miners' fund promoted the British conceptualization of a distinctive coal workers' pneumoconiosis. At the same time, the staff of the union health plan pressed the US Public Health Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Health to investigate the prevalence of occupational respiratory diseases among bituminous miners. Taken together, these endeavors contributed significantly to growing recognition of the severity and extent of this important public health problem and thus helped lay the foundation for the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969.\r"

DESIGN: Historical cohort study of all cases of infectious syphilis in Alberta from 1981 to 1987. PATIENTS: A total of 1090 patients were entered; 857 with primary syphilis, 183 with secondary syphilis, and 50 with early latent disease. Two hundred and eight patients were excluded who either were pregnant, had negative serologic results before treatment, had clinical relapse, were treatment failures, or were lost to follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: All 882 evaluable patients were treated with a recommended antibiotic regimen for infectious syphilis and returned for re-assessment including repeat serologic testing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-two percent (95% CI, 66% to 77%) and 56% (CI, 43% to 70%) of patients with initial episodes of primary or secondary syphilis had seroreverted according to rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test results by 36 months. A 2- and 3-tube decline was seen by 6 and 12 months in primary and secondary syphilis. Early latent syphilis resulted in only a 2-tube decrease at 12 months. Serologic response was not affected by sex, age, race, or sexual orientation. Patients with their first infection were more likely to experience RPR seroreversal than those with repeat infections. The RPR reversal rates also depended on the pretreatment titer and stage of disease. At 36 months, 24% (CI, 20% to 28%) of patients had nonreactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption tests (FTA-Abs), and 13% (CI, 11% to 15%) had nonreactive microhemoglutination tests for Treponema pallidum (MHA-TP). CONCLUSIONS: Adequate therapeutic response for syphilis must be based on illness episode and the pretreatment RPR titer. Treponemal tests can demonstrate seroreversion after 36 months, and a negative treponemal test does not rule out a past history of syphilis.\r"

DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unexplained syncope. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up tilt testing. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine (34%) patients (group 1) had abnormal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in 72%. Thirty-four (40%) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26%) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76%, 6%, and 30% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electrophysiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up tilt testing while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients.\r"

SETTING: Emergency department in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-five severely hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure less than or equal to 80 mm Hg) and 39 normotensive patients. MEASUREMENTS: Simultaneous fingerstick reagent strip glucose, venous reagent strip glucose, and laboratory glucose values were compared. Data were analyzed using error-grid analysis. RESULTS: In hypotensive patients, the mean fingerstick glucose values were significantly lower than the values obtained either by venous reagent strip or laboratory glucose measurements. Fingerstick glucose values in the hypotensive group were 67.5% of laboratory glucose values, and were significantly lower than the values obtained in the normotensive group (91.8%, P less than 0.001). Only 36% of the hypotensive patients had fingerstick glucose values within the acceptable range of 20% of the laboratory glucose value. Thirty-two percent of hypotensive patients were incorrectly diagnosed as hypoglycemic (glucose less than 3.89 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]); 2 of these patients were actually hyperglycemic (glucose greater than 11.10 mmol/L [200 mg/dL]). Venous reagent strip measurements accurately reflected laboratory glucose values in both hypotensive and normotensive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fingerstick glucose testing does not accurately represent venous glucose levels in severely hypotensive patients. If fingerstick glucose testing is relied on for these patients, errors in clinical management may be made. Venous reagent strip glucose testing correlates well with laboratory glucose measurements and should be the preferred method for rapid assessment of glucose level in critically ill patients with severe hypotension.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: English-language articles were identified through a search of the MEDLINE and Current Contents data-bases. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were examined for relevant articles. Case reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration through 19 September 1989 were obtained. STUDY SELECTION: Studies on the association between central nervous system toxicity (psychosis, agitation, hallucinations, delirium, mental status changes, disorientation, confusion, irritability, obtundation, or hostility) and H2 blockers were analyzed. DATA EXTRACTION: All data on the incidence of and potential predisposing factors for central nervous system reactions to H2 blockers were analyzed. Limitations of the data are discussed. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Central nervous system toxicities have been associated with all H2 blockers. These reactions generally occur during the first 2 weeks of therapy and resolve within 3 days of drug withdrawal. The estimated incidence of central nervous system reactions is 0.2% or less in outpatients and 1.6% to 80% in hospitalized patients. Cimetidine is most frequently associated with these reactions; however, no clear evidence exists that one H2 blocker is more likely than another to cause a reaction. Risk factors for central nervous system reactions have been proposed, but only advanced age has some, albeit limited, data to support it as a risk factor. Studies have only infrequently established causality and there have been difficulties in establishing risk factors for an relative incidences of a phenomenon that occurs infrequently in outpatients and that can be multifactorial in origin. CONCLUSIONS: All H2 blockers are associated with central nervous system reactions. There is no clear evidence of a higher rate of reactions with one H2 blocker compared with another.\r"

  ".U": "91229248\r", 
  ".W": "The variable mortality risk associated with chronic stable angina calls for careful selection of patients for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) if the aim of management is to prolong life. The randomized and observational studies done in the last 20 years have identified the variables relevant to patient selection and thus have provided a rational basis for such clinical decisions. These studies showed that the sicker the patient, as gauged by relevant measures of coronary disease and cardiovascular morbidity, the more likely it is that CABG will prolong life. A CABG-related improvement in survival is therefore more likely to occur the worse the left ventricular function; the greater the number of diseased vessels; the more proximal the location of coronary lesions (more muscle is threatened by such lesions); the greater the severity of the lesions as determined by angiography; the more severe the angina; the more easily provocable the ischemia or the more extreme the measures of ischemia; and, within limits, the older the patient. Greater survival gain after CABG also occurs in patients with peripheral vascular disease, in patients with baseline electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes, and probably in women. Thus, patients are likely to live longer after CABG if they have left main disease; three-vessel disease with left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 50%), class III or IV angina, provocable ischemia, or disease in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery; two-vessel disease with proximal left anterior descending artery involvement; and two-vessel disease with class III or IV angina as well as either severe left ventricular dysfunction alone or moderate left ventricular dysfunction together with at least one proximal lesion. When the decision of whether to do CABG is less clear-cut, the presence of peripheral vascular disease, female sex, baseline electrocardiographic ST-segment and T-wave changes, or older age (over 60 but under 80 years) should weigh in favor of doing CABG. In general, patients with single-vessel disease do not seem to derive survival benefit from CABG.\r"

Depending on the clinical effect after 8 weeks, the dosage was increased to either azathioprine, 150 mg, or methotrexate, 15 mg. The dosages for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone were held stable. MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory assessments were done by the same physician every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks and every 8 weeks thereafter. Radiographs of hands, wrists, and feet obtained at baseline and after 24 and 48 weeks were scored by one rheumatologist blinded to medication and clinical findings. MAIN RESULTS: Initial radiologic scores were comparable in both groups and correlated with disease duration (r = 0.38). An intention-to-treat analysis after 24 and 48 weeks showed significantly fewer new erosions in the methotrexate group compared with the azathioprine group (difference, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.2 to 3.9] and 3.5 [CI, 1.3 to 5.8], respectively). The change in total joint score was also significantly less pronounced in the methotrexate group compared with the azathioprine group after 24 weeks (difference, 2.8 [CI, 0.2 to 5.2]) and after 48 weeks (difference, 3.9 [CI, 0.3 to 7.4]). Radiologic stabilization after 48 weeks was present in 10% of the azathioprine group compared with 29% of the methotrexate group. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low-dose methotrexate showed significantly less radiologic progression than patients treated with azathioprine. This result suggests that methotrexate therapy is clinically superior in these patients.\r"

These images were rated as somewhat grainier than photographic images. Patients had fewer complications undergoing digital fluorescein angiography versus photographic fluorescein angiography. Digital fundus imaging is a legitimate alternative to photographic imaging and offers the potential advantage of fewer complications compared with photographic techniques.\r"

Infection usually presented as a severe keratoconjunctivitis with 35% of infected patients developing subepithelial corneal infiltrates. Most infections were acquired by hand-to-eye contact or by tonometry while visiting the military eye service for other ophthalmologic reasons. Intrafamilial transmission of the virus occurred in 22% of cases with rare disease spread outside the family or hospital environments. The peak incidence occurred from April to August 1986 but was not confirmed by viral isolation until May 1986 when appropriate control measures were instituted. The delay in application of appropriate control measures was a major factor accounting for both the prolonged duration and epidemic nature of this kerato-conjunctivitis outbreak.\r"

Bacterial infection was responsible in five of the eight cases where positive cultures were grown. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common bacterial pathogen isolated.

Sixty-seven families returned questionnaires and met inclusion/exclusion criteria; the results were used to analyze the medical, psychosocial, and economic impact of this program during the first year following instruction. Twenty-six families did not use R-DZP, primarily because of patient improvement. Among families using R-DZP, a total of 428 doses were administered to 41 children. R-DZP was effective in controlling seizures in 85% of patients. Adverse reactions usually were mild, consisting of drowsiness and/or behavioral changes. Compared to the year prior to instruction, emergency room visits decreased in both R-DZP-treated and -nontreated children; however, cost-savings were greater for the R-DZP group ($1,039.00 vs $420.00 per patient per year). Improvements in quality of life associated with the availability of R-DZP were observed by 58% of users and 27% of nonusers which included improved management of their children's seizures, increased flexibility in family activities, and greater peace of mind. R-DZP appears to be a practical method in the effective treatment of severe seizures at home.\r"

Examination of the frontal lobe indicates that these antibodies bind to the vessels, both arteries and veins. During cortical angiogenesis, the density and diameter of vessels increase rapidly from about 26 weeks gestation and peak at 35 weeks; after 35 weeks, the density and diameter of vessels are the same as those in adult brain. The white matter demonstrates no major changes in vessel density, although the pattern of the changes in vessel diameter resembles that of the cortex. Small immunopositive spots suggesting neovascularization reveal the same developmental tendency as the density of vessels in the cortex and white matter; therefore, it appears that neovascularization in the fetal brain during development is more rapid than cortical expansion and is equal to the growth of white matter. Neovascularization may be closely related to normal brain development and may play an undefined role in perinatal cerebrovascular insults.\r"

The growth of medulloblastoma 324, rhabdomyosarcoma TE671, and RD cells was markedly inhibited by gallium nitrate, while glioblastoma cell growth was only moderately inhibited (U373 cells) or actually stimulated (U87 cells). Gallium inhibited the cellular uptake of 59Fe; however, this block in 59Fe uptake was variable and closely paralleled the inhibitory effects of gallium on cell growth. Intracellularly, gallium may interfere with DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. Such effects may be of relevance in the treatment of brain tumors with this metal.\r"

In this review we explore several factors that play a role in cerebrovascular regulation in the immature brain and relate them to what is known about vascular regulation in the mature brain and to the types of pathology that occur in the newborn brain. One goal in this \"decade of the brain\" should be to increase our basic and clinical knowledge about the cerebrovasculature of the newborn in order to enhance our ability to predict and prevent perinatal brain injury.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging suggested that a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality, involving gray and white matter, should be linked with LNSS. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in demonstrating the full spectrum of CNS anomalies, including unilateral lissencephaly, a paucity of white matter, excessive and heterotopic gray matter, apparent left schizencephaly, and unilateral left colpocephaly (dilation of atrium and posterior horn of lateral ventricle). Postmortem examination revealed left hemisphere megalencephaly with a dilated posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The impressive gray matter heterotopias likely were the source of the patient's seizures and perhaps the ultimate cause of death. Megalencephaly and other deviations of neuronal migration should be considered as a dramatic component of LNSS.\r"

Three months after the initial hospitalization, he developed what the mother believed was \"a weakness on his right side.\" Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed severe white matter disease. Adrenoleukodystrophy was clinically suspected and an assay of plasma levels confirmed an elevation of C26 long-chain saturated fatty acid levels. After the patient's diagnosis of adrenoleukodystrophy was confirmed, long-chain fatty acid levels were obtained on his 5-year-old brother and his mother.

Because myelin splitting is commonly caused by toxic or metabolic diseases in humans and experimental animals, we believe that the vacuolation was due to the splitting of myelin which was caused by abnormal mitochondrial metabolism, even though this lesion is most commonly found in the white matter. We do not know whether the spongy lesion is formed only through myelin splitting in patients with subacute necrotizing encephalopathy; however, myelin splitting must play an important role in the formation of the spongy lesion.\r"

The glycine receptor was believed to be inhibitory in the central nervous system; however, a newly discovered glycine receptor is of the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor type, which cannot be antagonized by strychnine. The NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, was administered to a patient with nonketotic hyperglycinemia; he demonstrated some improvement in hyperirritability, voluntary movement, and electroencephalographic findings. Strychnine therapy had been administered before this trial of NMDA antagonist, but without improvement. The respiratory condition improved with the reduction of the CSF glycine level after withdrawal of sodium valproate. Our findings indicate that high-glycine content in CSF may affect the brain in different ways via NMDA and classic glycine receptors.\r"

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed leukoencephalopathy, especially in the cerebellum, but also in periventricular areas. The diagnosis of giant axonal neuropathy was established by biopsy of the sural nerve. The few previous histologic examinations have documented hyperplasia of the microfibrils which accumulate in the axons as well as in neurilemma, endothelial, and perineural cells.

  ".U": "91229937\r", 
  ".W": "During exercise patients with chronic left heart failure ventilate more than normal individuals at the same workload; the ratio of minute ventilation to minute production of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) is increased. The relation between increased VE/VCO2, severity of heart failure, and exercise capacity has not been defined. VE/VCO2 was measured in 47 patients with chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades II and III) and in 1009 healthy controls. Exercise capacity was assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) during progressive exercise. In the controls VO2max ranged from 25 to 93 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 17-36 and did not correlate with VO2max. In chronic left heart failure the VO2max ranged from 9 to 29 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 22-42 and correlated strongly with VO2max. End tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate at peak exercise were similar in the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure. The increase in VE/VCO2 on exercise in chronic left heart failure indicates increased physiological dead space, presumably caused by a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure the relation of VE/VCO2 to VO2max was curvilinear with a threshold of VO2max below which VE/VCO2 started to rise above the normal range. This point of inflection may be explained by the existence of a critical level of cardiac function necessary to perfuse adequately all lung zones on exercise.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To search for possible serum factors (immunochemical abnormalities) that reflect HLA-B27 associated inflammatory process with the proliferative endarteritis, which is an important cause of severe bradycardia and aortic valve regurgitation. PATIENTS AND METHODS--Seventy four men with pacemakers were studied: 24 were HLA-B27 positive and had associated rheumatic and cardiac disorders, 13 were B27 positive but had no clinical or radiographic signs of a related rheumatic condition, and 37 were B27 negative controls. Randomly obtained serum samples were examined for a series of serum factors. RESULTS--Thirteen (57%) of the 23 patients with HLA-B27 and associated rheumatic and cardiac conditions had platelet aggregating activity in their serum. No such activity was found in sera from patients in the other groups. None the less, immunochemical abnormalities were common among patients of all groups; 30 (41%) had antinuclear antibodies or rheumatoid factor or both. CONCLUSION--The platelet aggregating activity found in patients with HLA-B27 and associated rheumatic and cardiac conditions may reflect serum factors that increase the stickiness of platelets and increase their adhesion to the vessel wall. This suggests a link via release of platelet derived growth factor(s) with the characteristic histopathological feature of proliferative endarteritis. Immunochemical abnormalities were common in serum from all men with pacemakers.\r"

  ".U": "91229940\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate possible discrepancies between M mode and Doppler echocardiography in assessing early diastolic filling. DESIGN--Forty seven patients with left ventricular hypertrophy due to aortic stenosis and 26 healthy controls with a similar age range were studied by M mode, Doppler, apexcardiography, and phonocardiography. The patients also underwent cardiac catheterisation. M mode echograms were digitised by a computer. Early diastolic filling in both groups as assessed by the two techniques was compared. SETTING--A tertiary cardiac referral centre with facilities for non-invasive and invasive investigations. SUBJECTS--Patients referred for assessment of aortic stenosis who had left ventricular hypertrophy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Filling velocities on Doppler and rates of wall thinning and dimension increase on M mode. RESULTS--Digitised M mode indices of diastolic filling (peak wall thinning rate 6.4 (3.0) v 10.0 (3.0) cm/s and peak rate of dimension increase 9.3 (3.3) v 16 (4.5) cm/s) in the patients and controls were consistently different. In contrast, the Doppler A/E ratio and peak E wave velocity were not; they varied widely among patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. In part, this variability was because the Doppler A/E ratio, but not the digitised M mode indices, was very sensitive to the abnormalities of isovolumic relaxation frequently present in left ventricular hypertrophy. The Doppler A/E ratio varied similarly with age in both normal and hypertrophied hearts; in the patients with ventricular hypertrophy the peak rate of dimension increase depended on age only, whereas the thinning rate was independent of age in both the patients and controls. Neither the A/E ratio nor the M mode indices could be related to the left ventricular end diastolic pressure or the peak aortic pressure difference. CONCLUSIONS--When Doppler and M mode techniques are used to assess rapid filling in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy the M mode indices are more consistently abnormal. The two methods measure different aspects of left ventricular diastolic function and should be regarded as complementary rather than interchangeable.\r"

Colour flow mapping identified 19 of the 25 patients with a ventricular septal defect, continuous wave Doppler echocardiography identified 18, and the combined reference examination identified 24. Two of four patients without ventricular septal defect had a false positive result with colour flow mapping and none had a false positive result with continuous wave Doppler examination. During the reference examination continuous wave Doppler identified 24 patients with ventricular septal defects and colour flow mapping identified 23. In two patients a second ventricular septal defect was found by colour flow mapping, and confirmed by continuous wave Doppler. There was no significant difference in time to diagnosis between the two techniques. Colour flow mapping aids identification of multiple ventricular septal defects but is not faster and has lower specificity than continuous wave Doppler. A combination of the two techniques gave the highest sensitivity and specificity.\r"

  ".W": "To determine its potential impact on perioperative surgical management intraoperative ultrasound examination (cross sectional imaging, colour flow mapping, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler) was used in 16 consecutive patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. Epicardial cross sectional imaging before bypass defined the precise intracardiac morphology in 15 of 16 patients. The preoperative morphological diagnosis was refined in four patients (25%), and this influenced surgical management in two (12%). Epicardial studies after bypass identified seven residual haemodynamic lesions in five patients (three residual intercardiac shunts, one ventricular outflow obstruction, one pulmonary artery obstruction, two mitral valve regurgitation), and led to immediate revision during a second period of bypass in three (18%). In one patient who required early reoperation residual shunting was not detected after bypass by either colour flow mapping or a contrast study. Final intraoperative studies showed a good surgical result in 14 patients (87%). Flow characteristics and flow velocities within the Fontan circulation could be assessed immediately after the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass by means of combined pulsed wave Doppler and colour flow mapping in 14 of the 16 patients. Cross sectional studies of the left heart after bypass showed no change in ventricular function and allowed monitoring of volume replacement and ventricular filling. Intraoperative ultrasound was a valuable monitoring technique in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. It refined preoperative diagnosis, monitored ventricular function, and identified or excluded residual haemodynamic lesions in most patients.\r"

Doppler studies showed a phasic pattern of flow which varied with the respiratory cycle. Pulmonary blood flow was increased with normal inspiration, and was much augmented by the Mueller manoeuvre. This suggests that flow was occurring when a negative intrathoracic pressure was generated. During a brief Valsalva manoeuvre blood flowed away from the lungs. With a sustained Valsalva manoeuvre there was no spontaneous forward flow; instead there was low velocity pulsatile pulmonary blood flow that coincided with ventricular systole. Left ventricular cavity dimensions decreased, reflecting a considerably reduced pulmonary blood flow. Pulmonary blood flow after the total cavopulmonary shunt operation is critically dependent on changes in intrathoracic pressure. This has important implications in terms of the immediate postoperative management of these patients.\r"

There were no deaths from the procedure. Anastomoses were patent at a mean follow up of 33 months. Left ventricular angiograms before and after operation were digitised frame by frame. Analysis of wall motion showed considerable generalised hypokinesia with no change in cavity shape before operation. After reimplantation there was a significant improvement of global ventricular function as assessed by ejection fraction and end diastolic shape index. There was also a tendency for the shape index change to increase; this was compatible with better global systolic function. Three of the four patients who were restudied showed normal isometric and contour wall motion plots. One child, the oldest at the time of operation, still showed asynchronous onset of contraction and isovolumic relaxation. The procedure offers a low risk of mortality and a high rate of patency of the anastomosis. Improvement of ventricular function can be remarkable and its extent cannot be assessed simply by ejection fraction measurements.\r"

  ".U": "91230328\r", 
  ".W": "In 10 patients with previously untreated essential thrombocythemia (ET), by using 111In-labeled platelets and megakaryocyte morphometry, the relation between platelet production rate and bone marrow megakaryocytes was evaluated before and during alpha-2b-interferon (IFN) therapy. A highly significant decrease in platelet count occurred during IFN therapy; the platelet counts, at baseline and after 2 and 6 months of IFN therapy, were 1,102 +/- 345 x 10(9)/L, 524 +/- 169 x 10(9)/L (P less than .0001), and 476 +/- 139 x 10(9)/L (P less than .0001), respectively. The decrement in platelet count was mainly a result of diminished platelet production rate, which at baseline and after 2 and 6 months of IFN therapy was 89 +/- 30 x 10(10) platelets/d, 53 +/- 18 x 10(10) platelets/d (P = .0033), and 45 +/- 20 x 10(10) platelets/d (P less than .0001), respectively. Also, a slight shortening of platelet mean life-span (MLS) was observed in response to IFN treatment; platelet MLS was 7.96 +/- 0.69 days at baseline and 6.68 +/- 1.30 days (P = .012) after 6 months of IFN therapy. IFN induced a significant decrease in bone marrow megakaryocyte volume; both megakaryocyte nuclear and cytoplasmatic volumes were affected. The mean megakaryocyte volume was 372 +/- 126 x 10(2) pL/microL at baseline and 278 +/- 147 x 10(2) pL/microL (P = .049) after 6 months of IFN therapy. However, the number of megakaryocytes did not show any significant change in response to IFN. It is concluded that alpha-IFN reduces platelet production rate and the peripheral platelet count in ET mainly through an anti-proliferative action on the megakaryocytes and to a considerably lesser degree by a shortening of platelet MLS.\r"

  ".W": "This study reports the development of an assay, the Pre-colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, which detects human hematopoietic precursors. The Pre-CFU assay is based on the observation that precursors to CFU-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) that are undetectable in clonogenic assays differentiate into CFU-GM preferentially following treatment in suspension culture with recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (rhIL-1 alpha) combined with rhIL-3. Using the Pre-CFU assay, hematopoietic precursors were detected in human bone marrow depleted of CFU-GM progenitors and differentiated hematopoietic elements via 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide treatment coupled with selection for CD34+ cells (4-HCresistant/CD34+ marrow). Additionally, the Pre-CFU assay detected recovery of hematopoiesis substantially earlier than the CFU-GM assay in primates following myeloablation with 5-fluorouracil. The Pre-CFU assay was used to asses purification of a phenotypically defined hematopoietic precursor population, the lin-CD34+ population. The lin-CD34+ population lacks detectable surface markers for T-cell, B-cell, natural killer cell, and myeloid lineage, possesses the CD34 antigen, is devoid of CFU-GM progenitors, and yields Pre-CFU assay values comparable with 4-HCresistant/CD34+ marrow. Using a combination of phenotypic analysis and Pre-CFU assay analysis, the action of rhIL-1 alpha plus rhIL-3 treatment on lin-CD34+ cells was further characterized. The data indicate that rhIL-1 alpha plus rhIL-3 treatment induces proliferation and differentiation of early hematopoietic precursors into progenitors and terminally differentiated cells, without inducing a significant expansion of the precursor population itself.\r"

  ".W": "To understand the etiology of bone modulation and hypercalcemia observed in granulocytosis of a tumor-bearing animal model and to gain insight into the implication of sustained hematopoietic stimulation on the bone tissue, in vivo responses of normal mouse hematopoietic and bone tissues to long-term injections of recombinant human and murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), murine granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and human erythropoietin were quantitatively analyzed. Osteoclast activation was estimated by the osteoclast-endosteal ratio, determined by morphometric analyses of femoral sections. Medullary and bone areas were measured on transverse ground bone sections of the tibia. Recombinant murine G-CSF provoked marked granulocytosis associated with significant increases in the number of marrow granulocytes and their progenitors, and caused expansion of granulopoietic marrow into fatty marrow. The bone of G-CSF-treated mice showed a significant increase in endosteal osteoclast numbers with medullary area enlargement and a reduction in the bone thickness; indicative of endosteal bone resorption. Although GM-CSF had little effect on granulopoiesis, it caused peritoneal macrophages to increase and induced similar bone changes as those observed in G-CSF treatment. Enhanced erythropoiesis stimulated by erythropoietin was also associated with evidence of endosteal bone resorption. Bone changes induced by these growth factors were not associated with hypercalcemia. These animal studies document association of bone modulation in sustained stimulation of hematopoiesis, and implicate important physiologic effects of hematopoietic growth factors on skeletal tissue in vivo.\r"

MGF was a potent enhancing cytokine for Epo-dependent CFU-GEMM and BFU-E colony formation, stimulating more colonies and of a larger size than either rhu interleukin-3 (rhuIL-3) or rhuGM-CSF. MGF, especially at lower concentrations, also acted with rhuIL-3 or rhuGM-CSF to enhance Epo-dependent CFU-GEMM and BFU-E colony formation. MGF had little stimulating activity for CFU-GM colonies by itself, but in combination with suboptimal to optimal amounts of rhuGM-CSF enhanced the numbers and the size of CFU-GM colonies in an additive to greater than additive manner. While we did not detect an effect of MGF on CFU-G colony numbers stimulated by maximal concentrations of rhuG-CSF, MGF did enhance the size of CFU-G-derived colonies. MGF did not enhance the activity of rhuM-CSF. In a comparative assay, maximal concentrations of rmu and rhuMGF were equally effective in the enhancement of human bone marrow colony formation, but rhuMGF, in contrast to rmuMGF, did not at the concentrations tested enhance colony formation by mouse bone marrow cells. MGF effects on BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM may be direct acting ones as MGF-enhanced colony formation by these cells in highly enriched progenitor cell populations of CD34 HLA-DR+ and CD34 HLA-DR+CD33- sorted cells in which greater than or equal to 1 of 2 cells was a BFU-E plus CFU-GM plus CFU-GEMM. MGF appears to be an early acting cytokine that preferentially stimulates the growth of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

Mice were injected subcutaneously with 125 micrograms/kg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (in some cases 5 micrograms/kg), or 10 micrograms/kg of granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (IL-3) every 12 hours for 84 hours. 3HTdR labeling was performed in vivo after 3 days of treatment. G-CSF increased the peripheral neutrophil count 14-fold and increased the proportion and proliferation rate of neutrophilic cells in the marrow, suppressing erythropoiesis at the same time. Newly produced mature cells were released into the circulation within 24 hours of labeling, compared with a normal appearance time of about 96 hours. By contrast, GM-CSF and IL-3 had little effect on either marrow cell kinetics or on the rate of release of mature cells, although GM-CSF did stimulate a 50% increase in peripheral neutrophils. Monocyte production was also increased about eightfold by G-CSF and 1.5-fold by GM-CSF, but their peak release was only slightly accelerated. While the peripheral half-lives of the neutrophilic granulocytes were normal, those of the monocytes were dramatically reduced, perhaps due to sequestration in the tissues for functional purposes. The stimulated monocyte production in the case of G-CSF required an additional five cell cycles, a level that might have repercussions on the progenitor compartments.\r"

Although antibodies were prepared using the recombinant product of the large form of hM-CSF with a molecular weight (MW) of 85 Kd as the antigen, this immunoblot system was also capable of detecting the small form of hM-CSF with a MW of 40 to 60 Kd. A single band with a MW of 43 Kd, which reacted with anti-recombinant hM-CSF IgG but not with control IgG, was found when serum and urine from normal adults underwent electrophoresis on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and subsequent immunoblotting. This band represented a subunit of the large form of hM-CSF, because the large form of hM-CSF is a homodimer of a subunit with a MW of 43 Kd and the small form of hM-CSF is a homodimer of a subunit with a MW of 20 to 30 Kd. Analysis of serum and urine from leukemic patients and pregnant women, who had higher serum levels of hM-CSF than normal adults, showed only a single band with a MW of 43 Kd as a hM-CSF-specific molecule. These results suggest that the large form of hM-CSF is the major species in human body fluids.\r"

The incidence rates for the age groups 0 through 24, 25 through 59, and over 60 years were 4.3, 3.2, and 2.1 per million, respectively; the highest rate, 7.2 per million, was found for individuals aged 15 to 24 years. The male-to-female ratio was 1.9. The incidence of aplastic anemia in Bangkok is higher than that reported in recent European studies. The peak rate in young persons is almost fourfold higher than in comparable recent western studies and suggests an environmental etiology peculiar to Thailand.\r"

During the fibrinogen-to-fibrin conversion, A alpha-(148-160) appears to become accessible, because a monoclonal antibody against synthetic A alpha-(148-160) reacts with fibrin, but not with fibrinogen. Because a similar situation may exist for (at least parts of) FCB-5, we have prepared a monoclonal antibody against a part (ie, gamma-[312-324]) of FCB-5, and found that this is fibrin-specific and does not bind fibrinogen. We conclude that gamma-(312-324) is hidden in fibrinogen and is exposed by the formation of fibrin.\r"

  ".W": "Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of the serine protease, activated protein C (APC), an important regulatory enzyme in hemostasis. In view of the potential of human APC as an anticoagulant and profibrinolytic agent, the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of APC were studied in guinea pigs. The plasma elimination of a trace dose of 125I-APC was biphasic following an initial rapid elimination of approximately 15% of the injected dose within 1 to 2 minutes. This rapid removal of 125I-APC from the circulation was found to be a result of an association with the liver regardless of the route of injection. Essentially identical results were obtained with active site-blocked forms of APC generated with either diisopropylfluorophosphate or D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone, which indicates that the active site was not essential for the liver association. Accumulation of all three forms of APC in the liver peaked at 30 minutes and then declined as increasing amounts of degraded radiolabeled material appeared in the gastrointestinal tract and urine. Removal of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) domain of diisopropylphosphoryl-APC resulted in a 50% reduction in the association with liver and an accumulation in the kidneys. Protein C and protein S were cleared from the circulation at rates approximately one-half and one-fourth, respectively, that of APC. Both in vitro and in vivo, APC was found to form complexes with protease inhibitors present in guinea pig plasma. Complex formation resulted in a more rapid disappearance of the enzymatic activity of APC than elimination of the protein moiety. These findings indicate two distinct mechanisms for the elimination of APC. One mechanism involves reaction with plasma protease inhibitors and subsequent elimination by specific hepatic receptors. The other mechanism involves the direct catabolism of APC by the liver via a pathway that is nonsaturable over a substantial dose range and independent of the active site. This pattern of elimination is distinctly different from that observed with the homologous coagulation enzymes thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa.\r"

  ".U": "91230341\r", 
  ".W": "Antithrombin-III-Hamilton has been shown to be a structural variant of antithrombin-III (AT-III) with normal heparin affinity but impaired protease inhibitory activity. The molecular defect of AT-III-Hamilton is the substitution of Thr for Ala at amino acid residue 382. The plasma of affected individuals contains approximately equal quantities of normal AT-III and AT-III-Hamilton. When AT-III was isolated from the plasma of the propositus by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, it had identical mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to normal plasma-derived AT-III, under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. However, the AT-III-Hamilton species, separated from the propositus' normal AT-III by a combination of heparin-Sepharose and thrombin-Sepharose chromatography, had increased mobility on reductive SDS-PAGE compared with AT-III from the propositus isolated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography alone. Under nonreducing conditions this AT-III-Hamilton species had decreased mobility compared with AT-III from the propositus (or normal AT-III) isolated only by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. When incubated with either human alpha-thrombin or human factor Xa, this AT-III-Hamilton species was unreactive. Approximately 50% of the AT-III from the propositus isolated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography, when incubated with either human alpha-thrombin or factor Xa, did not form complex but was cleaved, presumably at the reactive center Arg393-Ser394. To further substantiate the biological behavior of this variant, AT-III-Hamilton polypeptides were synthesized in a cell-free system. This recombinantly produced AT-III-Hamilton, when incubated with either human alpha-thrombin or factor Xa, was cleaved by both these proteases, but did not show any complex formation. The results indicate that AT-III-Hamilton does not form a stable covalent inhibitory complex with these serine proteases but can be cleaved at the reactive center. Thus, the inhibition of serine proteases by their natural inhibitors (the serpins) involves at least two separate, but interrelated events; hydrolysis at the reactive center followed by complex formation. AT-III-Hamilton is capable of only the first of these events.\r"

The exception was a quinine-induced serum designated BU. The reaction of the six quinidine-induced sera was also partially blocked by an anti-GPIX MoAb, FMC25. Only 3 of the 12 patient sera showed drug-dependent antibody binding to GPIIb/IIIa, which was strongly inhibited by the anti-GPIIIa MoAb 22C4, and the anti-GPIIb alpha MoAb SZ22. With detergent-solubilized Serratia metalloprotease-treated platelets, quinine/quinidine-induced sera, except BU, immunoprecipitated a membrane-bound proteolytic fragment of GPIb-IX complex. In contrast, BU immunoprecipitated glycocalicin and a 40-Kd peptide tail fragment of GPIb alpha from the cell supernatant. Using purified GPIb-IX complex or its components as the target antigen, all the quinine-induced sera, except BU, immunoprecipitated GPIb-IX complex but failed to immunoprecipitate GPIb, GPIX, or the complex reformed from GPIb and GPIX. The quinidine-induced sera strongly immunoprecipitated purified GPIb-IX complex, weakly immunoprecipitated purified GPIX and the recombined complex, but did not immunoprecipitate purified GPIb. The combined data suggest that one quinine-dependent antibody (BU) recognizes an epitope in the peptide tail region of GPIb alpha and the other five quinine-dependent antibodies react with a complex-specific epitope on the membrane-associated region of GPIb-IX complex, whereas each of the six quinidine-induced sera contain two drug-dependent antibodies, one reactive with the GPIb-IX complex-specific epitope and the other reactive with GPIX. The binding domain(s) on GPIIb/IIIa for the quinine/quinidine-dependent antibodies appear to be sterically close to the epitopes for 22C4 and SZ22.\r"

We analyzed the reactivity of synthetic peptide analogs of adhesive proteins toward human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), assaying their detachment from extracellular matrix and attachment to extracellular matrix components in vitro. Synthetic peptide analogs Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser-Pro (GRGDSP), Arg-Gly-Asp-Val (RGDV), Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS), and Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe (RGDF), which are analogous to \"cell adhesion sites\" of fibronectin, vitronectin, von Willebrand factor, and alpha-chain of human fibrinogen, respectively, caused significant detachment of HUVEC from the extracellular matrix in vitro at the concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mmol/L. They also interfered with attachment of HUVEC to surfaces coated with subendothelial extracellular matrix or its components. The synthetic peptide analog of HHLGGAKQAGDV, which is homologous to the gamma-chain of human fibrinogen sequence 400-411, did not cause any measurable effect on the integrity of HUVEC monolayers (detachment and attachment). \"Hybrid\" peptides bearing salient features of both sequences, ie, Ala-Lys-Gln-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe (AKQRGDF) and Lys-Gln-Arg-Gly-Asp-Phe (KQRGDF), had an attenuated effect on the detachment of HUVEC from extracellular matrix. Thus, the integrity of the human endothelial cell monolayer anchored to the extracellular matrix, as measured in detachment and attachment assays, is disturbed by peptides containing RGD sequence whereas the synthetic peptide His-His-Leu-Gly-Gly-Ala-Lys-Gln-Ala-Gly-Asp-Val (HHLGGAKQAGDV) is nonreactive.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder due to autoantibodies against platelets that result in their destruction. In some patients, these autoantibodies bind to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa. With the aim of better defining the antigenic epitopes, plasma from 13 selected patients with chronic ITP known to have anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies was tested for reactivity with nine synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the GP IIIa molecule. Of these plasmas, five bound significantly (P less than .001) with either peptide 8 (amino acids 721-744) or peptide 9 (amino acids 742-762), which together form most of the carboxyterminal region presumed to be the cytoplasmic domain. Three of these positive plasmas, were tested further. In two of these positive plasmas, the anti-peptide antibodies represented greater than 80% of the detectable circulating autoantibody. To further evaluate the importance of the carboxyterminal region as an antigenic site, the chronic ITP plasmas were tested against Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with GPIIb and either whole GPIIIa or GPIIIa lacking amino acids 728 to 762. Ten of the 13 plasmas required the presence of this region for significant autoantibody binding. We conclude that the carboxyterminal region is an important area for stimulating antiplatelet autoantibody formation in some patients with chronic ITP. It is not known whether these autoantibodies to the presumed cytoplasmic domain play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease or occur as a secondary phenomenon during the course of platelet destruction.\r"

The minimal detection level was 20 pg/mL G-CSF. In patients with bacterial meningitis, the G-CSF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid were extremely elevated, showing a mean value of approximately 1,500 pg/mL. On the other hand, G-CSF levels in the cerebrospinal fluid from 67% patients with aseptic meningitis were moderately increased, showing a mean value of about 80 pg/mL, whereas G-CSF levels in 33% samples remained undetectable. The G-CSF levels and neutrophil counts in the cerebrospinal fluid were proven to be related by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient analysis (r = .724). These elevations of G-CSF levels at inflammation sites associated with bacterial meningitis may indicate that G-CSF plays an important role in the combat of bacterial infections.\r"

  ".W": "Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients, whose immune systems are severely compromised. However, normal responses to this bacterium are apparently sufficient to prevent disseminated infection because disease is rarely found unless an immunocompromised state is present. Because interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an inflammatory cytokine with a multitude of activities, we investigated the potential of MAI to induce IL-6 from normal human leukocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were fractionated into monocytes (Mo), large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and T cells and stimulated with bacteria. Culture supernatants were collected and assayed for IL-6 activity by bioassay. Mo and LGL, but not T cells, were found to release IL-6 within 12 hours of stimulation, with optimal production occurring by 2 days of culture. Production of IL-6 from human leukocyte subsets was confirmed by Northern blot analysis and by neutralization of biologic function of the culture supernatants with specific antisera. Taken together, these results indicate that production of IL-6 is a key response of Mo and LGL to MAI. The role of IL-6 in MAI infection, therefore, needs to be further investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Therapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) has been shown to be effective in restoring hematopoiesis to some patients with aplastic anemia. It would be useful to have a method for predicting those likely to be responders versus nonresponders. The mode of immunostimulatory action of ALG is of interest in addition to its immunosuppressive action. We examined in vitro the distribution of the proliferative responses of ALG-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from 18 patients with aplastic anemia, eight of whom responded to ALG and 10 who did not. We found a significant difference in the proliferative response of PBMCs obtained from the eight responders versus the 10 nonresponders (P less than .01). Two-color flow cytometry analysis of the patients' PBMCs stimulated by ALG in vitro showed that the CD4-positive subsets were activated to a greater extent by ALG than the CD8-positive subsets. Moreover, a positive correlation with the clinical response of patients to ALG with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor produced by their PBMCs stimulated by ALG suggests that the immunostimulatory property of ALG has an important role in the treatment of aplastic anemia. Our results suggest that the clinical response to ALG therapy is correlated with its lymphocyte proliferative effect in vitro, and indicates that the assessment of the proliferative response of PBMCs in vitro would be useful in predicting the clinical response to ALG therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The integrin superfamily of cell adhesion receptors consists of heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of unique alpha and beta subunits. These receptors mediate cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesive properties for a variety of cell types. This investigation has focused on the histologic distribution of the beta 1 subfamily of integrins within lymphoid tissues including tonsil, lymph node, spleen, thymus, and appendix. The dendritic cells of both follicular center and thymic origin express the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6, as well as the beta 1 integrin subunits. Most lymphoid cells in normal tissues do not express the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits, or the alpha v beta 3 integrin. The beta 1 subunit is expressed by all lymphocytes but with variable intensity. Increased levels of the alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits are observed in the follicular light zone, suggesting a role for these integrins in B-cell activation. Although the alpha 4 subunit is expressed by all lymphoid cells, an increased expression of alpha 4 and decreased expression of beta 1 by the mantle zone B-cell compartment is noted in comparison with the decreased expression of alpha 4 and increased expression of beta 1 by follicular center B-cells. These studies suggest that alpha 4 may be paired with a beta subunit other than beta 1 on the mantle zone lymphoid population. Thus, integrin expression by cells of lymphoid tissues varies with location and function and differs significantly from integrin expression observed on circulating and cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "In search of a possible involvement of the human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) in human Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, we studied the levels of anti-HHV-6 antibodies in the sera of 94 cases by an immunofluorescence assay, as well as the presence of HHV-6 sequences in the affected tissues of 66 cases by polymerase chain reaction, using one set of primer oligonucleotides. Our results showed higher anti-HHV-6 antibody titers in human lymphomas than in normal blood donors, but the difference is statistically significant only when normal donors are compared with Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. HHV-6 sequences were detected in 3 of 25 Hodgkin's lymphomas and 0 of the 41 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas studied. The three cases positive for HHV-6 sequences belong to the nodular sclerosis-lymphocyte depletion histologic subtype and share remarkable similarities in their clinical features. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of total genomic DNA obtained from the neoplastic tissues of two of the three patients showed the same restriction fragment length polymorphism. Our results suggest that: (1) the high level of anti-HHV-6 antibodies in Hodgkin's disease is due to an activation of the immune system not related to the presence of HHV-6 sequences in affected lymph nodes; (2) the presence of HHV-6 sequences in human lymphoid tissues is not a frequent event, rather it is in fact a very rare event in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, while in Hodgkin's cases it is more frequent than previously reported on the basis of Southern blot analysis; and (3) the presence of HHV-6 sequences in Hodgkin's lymphomas may have a relation with the clinical presentation of the disease.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, culture supernatants from larger granular lymphocytes (LGL) that were activated with Candida albicans antigens were shown to stimulate the ability of neutrophils to inhibit fungal growth. Identification of the activation factors showed that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a hematopoietic growth factor, was involved. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were fractionated by Percoll density centrifugation and each subpopulation of cells was stimulated with C albicans yeast cells. GM-CSF was produced in those fractions enriched for LGL, but not T lymphocytes or adherent monocytes. Additionally, the phenotype of the GM-CSF-producing cell was found to be CD2+, CD16+, HLA-DR+, and negative for CD4, CD8, and CD15. Kinetic studies demonstrated that GM-CSF appeared in the supernatants within 2 days of culture and continued to be produced up to 7 days. Optimal stimulation of LGL was seen at a ratio of 3 heat-killed C albicans yeast cells per LGL. Thus, LGL play an important role in host defense against this opportunistic pathogen by producing cytokines, including GM-CSF, which in turn activates the fungicidal activity of neutrophils.\r"

We examined the contribution of these adhesive proteins to human peripheral blood monocyte adherence to endothelium using transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing these proteins and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to ELAM-1, VCAM-1, or CD49d/CD29 (VLA-4), the leukocyte receptor for VCAM-1. Monocytes bound to CHO cells transfected with cDNA of ELAM-1 or VCAM-1. Binding to ELAM-1 was inhibited by MoAb to ELAM-1 and binding to VCAM-1 was inhibited by MoAb to VCAM-1 or the alpha-chain of very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4) (CD49d). Additive inhibition of adherence to unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVE) was observed when monocytes were pretreated with both MoAb to CD49d and MoAb to CD18, the common beta-chain of the leukocyte beta 2 integrin receptors. Adherence of monocytes to HUVE stimulated by recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha was not reduced by MoAbs to CD18, CD49d, or ELAM-1 when used singly, but combinations of these MoAbs produced significant inhibition. We conclude that multiple receptor-ligand systems are involved in monocyte adherence to endothelium.\r"

Various LCR fragments were inserted into an expression vector consisting of an A gamma-globin promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (gamma-neo). Using these vectors, we determined that a 2.5-kb DNA fragment containing LCR sites I through IV (previously named mu locus activation region [mu LAR]) had activity in all three assays; of the individual LCR sites, only site II was highly active in all three assays. One region within site II, consisting of tandem AP-1/NF-E2 consensus elements, had approximately 10% as much colony assay activity as the entire mu LAR. However, this region did not have detectable activity in a transient enhancer assay in uninduced K562 cells, nor was it capable of conferring hemin inducibility on linked gamma-globin promoters in stably transfected cells. Finally, we tested the ability of the mu LAR to activate promoters (beta-globin and cathepsin G) that are not normally expressed in K562 cells. beta-neo was minimally activated by the mu LAR in transient transfection experiments. The mu LAR increased the number of stably transfected colonies produced by beta-neo, but the absolute number of beta-neo colonies, with or without the mu LAR, was approximately 10% to 20% that of gamma-neo. In contrast, a minimal cathepsin G promoter was activated by the mu LAR in K562 cells. Our results suggest that LCR functions are dependent in part on the environments and the promoters with which the LCR is tested.\r"

  ".U": "91230355\r", 
  ".W": "Remarkable differences in the suppression of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) have been found for anti-Thy-1 antibodies to relate to (1) antigen density and antibody coating on the target cells, (2) antibody isotype, and (3) uptake of complement subcomponent C1q. Regarding (2) and (3) we now demonstrate that depletion of the third complement component C3 by cobra venom factor (CVF) differentiates two T-cell elimination pathways in mice: four rat IgG2c anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) with low uptake of mouse C1q lost most of their T-cell-depleting and consequently GVHD-preventing effect in C3-depleted H2 IA incompatible semiallogeneic (C57BL/6xCBA)F1 mice. In contrast, eight rat IgG2b, mouse IgG2a, and 2b anti-Thy-1 MoAbs with high affinity for C1q still remained strongly T-cell-depleting and prevented GVHD even in fully mismatched CBA mice depleted of C3. In conjunction with our observation that anti-Thy-1 MoAbs also suppress GVHD in C5-deficient AKR mice, we conclude that complete complement activation until T-cell lysis is not required for our antibodies to be effective in vivo. Activation, but only until deposition of C3b on target-cells for opsonisation via C3b receptors, is necessary with the less immunosuppressive anti-Thy-1 IgG2c isotype with low affinity for C1q. Mouse C1q uptake and C3/C4 deposition on target cells were measured with labeled antibodies and localized in T-cell areas. Interestingly, not even activation until C3b is necessary with the most immunosuppressive C1q-high-affine isotypes. As far as the latter is concerned, we discuss whether elimination of antibody-coated cells via Fc receptors is enhanced by binding to C1q-receptors and/or by intercalating C1q expressed on macrophages.\r"

They were divided into four groups: group 1 (n = 24) had initially been treated with three cycles of (mechlorethamine, vincristine, prednisone, and procarbazine [MOPP]) and wide-field irradiation therapy; group 2 (n = 25) had six cycles of MOPP; group 3 (n = 15) and group 4 (n = 16) both initially received MOPP/ABVD (MOPP plus doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) or MOPP/ABV hybrid, but group 3 received conventional salvage regimens whereas group 4 was treated with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation as salvage therapy (n = 16). Freedom from second failure (FF2F) was used as the major endpoint. Actuarial FF2F for all patients was 38% after a median follow-up of 75 months for patients who were alive. Risk factor analysis was performed on the 71 patients who had been treated with curative intent. The presence or absence of any one of three risk factors had a strong negative impact on outcome: stage IV disease at primary diagnosis, B symptoms at relapse, or a time from primary treatment to relapse of less than 1 year. Actuarial FF2F at 5 years was 17% in the group of patients with one or more of these three factors present (n = 49). If none of these factors was present, FF2F was 82% (n = 22) (P less than .001). Even high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation were not able to overcome the negative impact of one or more risk factors (FF2F = 19%, n = 12). The outcome of salvage treatments depends most on the presence or absence of these three risk factors and less on the type of salvage treatment. Patients with none of these risk factors present have an excellent outcome if they are treated with non-cross-resistant chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, or both. Novel approaches are needed for patients with one or more of these factors present. Reports on salvage treatments for Hodgkin's disease in first relapse after primary chemotherapy should include data on the proportion of patients having stage IV disease at diagnosis, B symptoms at relapse, and a time from primary treatment to relapse of less than 1 year.\r"

Multiple comparisons of pulmonary artery catheter (PAC), rectal (R), and tympanic membrane (TM) temperatures were performed in nine adult ICU patients using PAC temperatures as the gold standard. The correlation between R (r = 0.93) and PAC was significantly better than TM (r = 0.74) temperatures. However, PAC (37.2 +/- 0.06 degrees C; mean +/- SEM) and TM (37.1 +/- 0.08 degrees C) temperatures were not significantly different, whereas R (37.6 +/- 0.07 degrees C) was significantly warmer than both (P less than .05). Differences between either R (+0.4 degrees C) or TM (-0.1 degrees C) and PAC temperatures were consistent over selected ranges between 35 degrees C and 40 degrees C. The performance of TM and R was similar in the ability to predict PAC temperatures.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-seven children at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation were enrolled in a study comparing the accuracy and acceptability of tympanic membrane temperatures taken with Thermoscan to rectal or oral temperatures taken by IVAC electronic thermometers. The mean age of the rectal/ear group was 1.2 +/- 0.86 years (range 0.08-5.0 years) with 22 females and 21 males. The mean age of the oral and ear group was 9.0 +/- 4.24 years (range 3-18 years) with 44 females and 50 males. Significantly large (p less than 0.01) correlation coefficients were present between temperatures in the left ear and right ear (0.92), rectal and mean ear (0.77) and oral and mean ear (0.68). The temperature difference between mean ear and rectal measurements was -1.1 degree +/- 0.51 degree C and the temperature difference between the mean ear and oral measurements was -0.20 degrees +/- 0.59 degrees C. A relative lack of correlation between ear and oral temperatures was noted with flat tympanograms, otoscopically diagnosed middle ear effusion, and with red-white or red tympanic membranes. However, small subgroup sizes (6-16) may have contributed to this lack of correlation. Parents and physicians were impressed by the 2.5 second speed of the new technique. However, younger children were nearly as likely to resist and cry with ear as with rectal temperatures. Parents were comfortable with the ease, cleanliness and safety of ear temperatures. While these data indicate a strong correspondence of ear temperatures with oral and rectal temperatures, parents were not as confident of ear temperatures' accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Body temperature is often the sole determinant of whether or not the neutropenic cancer patient is admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic therapy. Recently developed infrared tympanic thermometers offer rapid readings, but their accuracy has not been established. We studied two infrared thermometers (FirstTemp and Thermoscan) and a thermistor (IVAC) in children with cancer. Mean infrared measurements did not differ significantly between right and left ear canals, and the mean IVAC temperature did not differ significantly from the left to the right axilla (P greater than 0.05, paired t test). IVAC predictive mode mean temperature was 0.2 degrees C lower than monitor mode mean temperature in the axilla (P less than 0.0001), but 0.1 degree C higher than monitor mode orally (P less than 0.0001). Aiming the infrared instrument at the tympanic membrane using an ear tug resulted in a 0.2 degree C higher mean temperature than casual placement in the ear canal (P less than 0.0001). After compensation for the mean difference in reference oral glass-mercury versus test instrument temperatures, the FirstTemp, Thermoscan, and oral and axillary predictive mode IVAC measurements yielded sensitivities for the detection of fever of 84%, 84%, 82%, and 86%; specificities of 100%, 99%, 100%, and 100%; positive predictive values of 100%, 93%, 100%, and 100%; and negative predictive values of 95%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. We conclude that each of these instruments detects fever with comparable reliability. Infrared instruments are especially attractive alternatives due to their time efficiency.\r"

Eighty-four children with unilateral suppurative or non-suppurative otitis media diagnosed clinically by their pediatricians were enrolled in the study. Temperatures were measured in both ears using the Thermoscan PRO-1 Instant Thermometer and rectally or orally by a glass or electronic predictive thermometer. For 67 children with unilateral suppurative otitis media the mean temperature in infected ears was 0.38 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in uninfected ears (p = .005). Neither temperatures measured in affected nor those from unaffected ears differed significantly from oral or rectal control readings. For 17 children with unilateral non-suppurative otitis media there was no statistically significant difference between temperatures in affected and unaffected ears or between the temperatures in either ear and the oral or rectal control. Our data show that temperatures taken in ears with suppurative otitis media are slightly higher than those in normal ears. This difference is of minimal clinical significance and does not affect the accuracy when compared to oral or rectal control readings.\r"

Patients were alternately assigned to have their temperature taken with either a tympanic thermometer or with a rectal or oral thermometer. Parents and nurses were then asked to fill out a short questionnaire to describe their observations of the child's behavior during temperature taking and to describe their own feelings about the temperature taking method used. Parents were also asked to assess their usual method of temperature taking at home and their child's usual behavioral response. Tympanic thermometry was rated higher by both parents and nurses for speed, ease, cleanliness, and safety. Parents and nurses were more confident in the accuracy of traditional temperature taking methods. Children whose temperatures were taken rectally were more likely to be observed by both parents (p = .02) and nurses (p = .01) to have a negative behavioral reaction to the procedure than children whose temperatures were taken by tympanic thermometry. There was no difference observed between the behavioral responses of children who had temperatures taken orally and those who had tympanic thermometry.\r"

Recordings were made at baseline and after 15 and 20 minutes of exposure to either warm (35 degrees C) or cool (18.3 degrees C) environmental temperatures. Differences were examined for the three temperature sites and times using repeat measures analysis of variance. No significant differences in RT (37.7 degrees +/- 0.3 degrees C; mean +/- SD) were observed at any time. Both OT (+0.5 degrees C) and TMT (+0.7 degrees C) were significantly changed during warm, but not cool exposure, compared to baseline conditions. We conclude that OT and TMT have a predictable relationship to RT at normal ambient temperature. However, in warm examination areas, spuriously elevated OT and TMTs may occur.\r"

Recent introduction of infrared non-contact thermometers for the auditory canal requires the establishing of temperature relationships between the ear and more traditional thermometry sites. Since an auditory canal is exposed to the environment, the infrared readings from it are influenced by ambient temperature. A linear model of thermal gradients in the vicinity of an ear canal allows us to find simple formulas connecting temperatures taken from the ear with those from traditional core sites like bladder or pulmonary artery, in addition to rectal and oral. The formulas contain environment coupling coefficients. Their values have been found experimentally by measuring body temperatures from subjects in a walk-in environmental chamber and from multiple clinical studies. The derived coefficients are used in the Thermoscan PRO-1 Instant Thermometer to calculate core, oral and rectal equivalent temperatures.\r"

No significant toxicity was detected. Allopurinol riboside peaks in plasma 1.6 hours after administration, has an elimination half-life of 3 hours, and steady-state concentrations in the therapeutic range. However, in contrast to preclinical studies in dogs (plasma levels proportional to oral doses up to 200 mg/kg), we found that plasma levels were unexpectedly low and did not rise with increasing dose. Furthermore, allopurinol and oxypurinol (unanticipated metabolites) were detected at levels proportional to the dose of allopurinol riboside.

Atracurium and laudanosine concentrations were measured by HPLC. Neuromuscular blockade was measured at the adductor pollicis, after stimulation of the ulnar nerve. Venous levels were lower than corresponding arterial values for up to 20 minutes, and this difference was marked for the early samples. Neuromuscular blockade was maximum after 5 to 7 minutes, much later than the peak venous concentration (1 to 3 minutes). Nonparametric analysis yielded (mean +/- SEM) a rate constant, concentration for 50% blockade, and slope of the effect-concentration relationship of 0.092 +/- 0.01 min-1, 379 +/- 27 ng/ml, and 7.3 +/- 1.67, respectively, when based on arterial samples. The values were statistically different (0.135 +/- 0.011 min-1, 235 +/- 42 ng/ml, and 3.41 +/- 0.37, respectively) when venous levels were used (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that forearm venous levels do not correspond to adductor pollicis neuromuscular blockade and the kinetics and kinetic-dynamic relationship for atracurium are heavily dependent on sampling site.\r"

Methylprednisolone doses of 0.6 mg/kg total body weight were administered as the 21-succinate sodium salt. Absolute clearance (in liters per hour) of methylprednisolone was 40% less in the obese subjects. Total volume of distribution (Vss) of methylprednisolone was unchanged (about 120 L), but when normalized for total body weight, Vss per kilogram was less in obesity. The patterns of cortisol, blood histamine, and helper T cell responses after methylprednisolone administration were similar in both groups, but more profound effects were observed in the obese subjects. Pharmacodynamic models were applied for these immediate effects of methylprednisolone based on the premise that receptor interactions of steroids are followed by rapid suppression of the circadian rhythm of cortisol and recirculation of basophils and helper T cells, which persist until inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of methylprednisolone disappear. Similar IC50 values for the three effects were obtained in both groups, indicating no intrinsic pharmacodynamic differences in sensitivity to these methylprednisolone effects in obesity. However, methylprednisolone should be administered on the basis of ideal body weight, and the dosing interval should be potentially lengthened because of decreased methylprednisolone clearance in obesity.\r"

A one-compartment open model was used for pharmacokinetic analysis. Hypotheses were tested to determine which developmental and demographic data influenced clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V(area)). In the final regression equation CL and V(area) were modeled as a function of body weight and postnatal age (PNA) from 0 to 20 days. Final estimates were as follows: CL (ml/hr) = 2.63.weight (kg) + 0.244.PNA (days) and V(area) (L) = 0.28.weight (kg) + 0.0041.PNA (days). The coefficients of variation for interindividual variability in CL and V(area) were 77% and 28%, respectively. Intraindividual variability was 19%. These mean population parameter estimates should prove useful in designing dosage regimens to achieve desired indomethacin concentrations for neonates from 0 to 20 days of age with symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus.\r"

The addition of ketoconazole did not significantly change the clearance (96 +/- 11 versus 90 +/- 11 ml/hr/kg), mean residence time (4.29 +/- 0.43 versus 4.45 +/- 0.59 hours), volume of distribution (0.41 +/- 0.02 versus 0.40 +/- 0.02 L/kg), or plasma protein binding characteristics of prednisolone. The suppressive effects of prednisolone on serum cortisol, blood basophil, and helper T lymphocyte values, assessed by the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) after prednisolone administration to the baseline AUC, was not altered significantly by ketoconazole. The 50% inhibitory concentration values derived from pharmacodynamic models developed to describe the direct suppressive effects of corticosteroids indicated no alteration in intrinsic sensitivity in the presence of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics or the pharmacodynamic response patterns of selected direct suppression effects of single low doses of prednisolone.\r"

A single-dose study of theophylline kinetics was performed at baseline and after 5 days of mexiletine treatment. With mexiletine the plasma clearance of theophylline decreased from 33.5 +/- 2.6 (mean +/- SEM) to 17.9 +/- 1.0 ml/kg per hour in the female group (p less than 0.001) and from 32.3 +/- 2.6 to 19.3 +/- 1.3 ml/kg per hour in the male group (p less than 0.001). The elimination half-life was prolonged by 74% and 103% in the male and female groups, respectively. Mexiletine decreased the formation of all theophylline metabolites in both groups. Within each group, the demethylation pathways were affected more than the hydroxylation pathway. These data indicate that mexiletine is a potent inhibitor of theophylline metabolism. This effect is not influenced by gender. Concurrent administration of these drugs may require a dose reduction of theophylline by as much as 50% to minimize the risk of toxicity.\r"

A potentially useful measure of drug effect is postural sway, which is a manifestation of the corrective mechanisms associated with the maintenance of upright posture. Postural sway was measured over 8 hours, with a biomechanics force platform, in six healthy male volunteers who received triazolam, 0.125, 0.250, or 0.375 mg, or placebo in a randomized double-blind study. Our results show a dose-dependent increase in postural sway measured as the elliptical area or the 95% confidence ellipse for the area covered by the subjects' sway. After triazolam, 0.250 and 0.375 mg, the area under the sway-time curve and peak effect increased significantly compared with placebo (p less than 0.05). The number of losses of balance when subjects stood on one foot also showed a significant increase with increased dose (p less than 0.05). The rate of loss of balance was positively correlated with the extent of postural sway (r = 0.802; p less than 0.001). The extent of sway when the subjects were drug free predicted this increase in a subject's postural sway with triazolam. Thus at hypnotic or anxiolytic doses of triazolam, computer-assisted force platform measures of sway provide a clinically relevant measure of drug effect. Measurement of drug-induced postural sway may be useful in persons at risk for falls, such as the elderly.\r"

Reestablishing family equilibrium following hospital discharge should begin by encouraging the hospital staff to share responsibility with the family, allowing them to \"rehearse\" the roles they will play at home. The cardinal tasks for which the physician can support the family in attempting to perform are: providing emotional support for the patient, making observations, providing physical assistance, performing household chores, participating in the treatment regimen, and calling for assistance. These functions are the backbone of successful family involvement in home care, even when \"high-tech\" procedures are being used. Referral to self-help groups or appropriate home health aide services is also an important role the informed physician can perform.\r"

The periodicity of the exposure profile was chosen to simulate that of human exposure to environmental toxins, albeit at a higher dose than would be permitted in the workplace. The development of significant liver injury in this animal model raises the possibility that some chronic liver injury in humans may be due to alcohol potentiation of other hepatotoxins present in the environment at subtoxic levels.\r"

The amount of HLA class I antigen on peripheral blood mononuclear cells varied markedly among individual patients, but the overall results indicated that the level of inducible antigen did not correlate with increments of ALT during therapy or with a virological response to therapy. Hepatocyte staining for HLA class I antigen was observed in a minority of biopsy specimens (29%) and also did not appear to predict a response or correlate with the severity of histological disease.

In light of this recent functional reinterpretation of T-lymphocyte subpopulations, we reinvestigated the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsy specimens from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. In normal liver, the few scattered mononuclear cells present in portal tracts and in the intralobular parenchyma consisted of both CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) naive and CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells. In inflammatory liver diseases, portal tract and periportal and intralobular areas of inflammation consisted virtually only of CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells, which strongly expressed the CDw29 (4B4) antigen, and the adhesion molecules LFA-1, CD2, LFA-3, CD44 and VLA-4 and the activation marker human leukocyte antigen-DR. These results indicate that activated memory T cells represent the predominant subpopulation of lymphocytes in areas of liver inflammation. Memory T cells strongly express various homing receptors and adhesion molecules, which probably allow them to accumulate at inflammatory sites and to strengthen interaction with target cells. Furthermore, the increased number of memory T cells with enhanced interferon-gamma production in areas of liver inflammation may contribute to the maintenance and up-regulation of immune responses occurring in inflammatory liver diseases.\r"

Most of the family members had no history of acute hepatitis, were asymptomatic and were unaware of their carrier status. However, 5.3% had stigmata of chronic liver disease, 6% had serum ALT levels that exceeded two times the upper limit of normal and 78% of those who had biopsies had chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis. During a follow-up period of 12 to 90 mo (median = 39 mo), 3% had symptoms of chronic liver disease; 24% had transient, recurrent or persistent elevation in serum ALT levels, 1.4% had cirrhosis and 1% had hepatocellular carcinoma.

  ".W": "It has been proposed that in the human liver, the estrogen receptor gene may become inappropriately expressed as a consequence of HBV integration, contributing to cell transformation. This study was undertaken to examine estrogen receptor status in patients with hepatitis B virus infection and to analyze the expression of progesterone receptor and of a heat-shock 27,000-D protein (hsp27), both of which are estrogen regulated in estrogen target tissues. Receptor proteins were detected in liver biopsy specimens by immunocytochemistry using antireceptor monoclonal antibodies; a monoclonal antibody was also used to detect hsp27. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were mainly seen in the nuclei of hepatocytes. The presence of hepatitis B virus infection did not always result in elevated estrogen receptor expression, but in general the expression of this receptor protein was higher in hepatitis B virus-positive patients than in patients with the same pathological findings (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma) but without hepatitis B virus. This was more clearly seen in the patients with hepatitis. Although estrogen receptor expression was moderate to high in many samples, the expression of the two biochemical markers of estrogen action at postreceptor levels (progesterone receptor and hsp27) was low or absent in most of the liver tissues examined, suggesting that in the liver the interaction of estrogen-estrogen receptor-DNA has characteristics inherent to this tissue.\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that hepatocyte injury resulting from infection with hepatitis D virus may be caused by a direct virus cytotoxicity in contrast to immune-mediated injury associated with hepatitis B virus. We have transfected HeLa and HepG2 continuous cell lines with a recombinant plasmid containing the hepatitis D antigen gene under the inducible control of the human metallothionein promoter. The addition of zinc to the cell culture medium then led to the expression of hepatitis D antigen associated with, in the short term, a significant reduction in the rate of RNA but not DNA synthesis and, in the longer term, cell death. The necrotic cells had pyknotic nuclei and shrunken eosinophilic cytoplasm; these necrotic cells resembled the apoptotic bodies seen in hepatitis D virus-related hepatitis. The level of hepatitis D antigen in individual cells that produced these changes was similar to the level of hepatitis D antigen in hepatocytes from a chimpanzee with acute hepatitis D virus infection. We conclude that the expression of hepatitis D antigen resulted in significant cytotoxic changes in these cells, providing strong support for the view that hepatitis D antigen may be specifically cytotoxic to infected hepatocytes in vivo.\r"

During this period, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels in fetal serum declined significantly. The correlation coefficients between fetal age and concentration of serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were -0.80 (p less than 0.001) and -0.77 (p less than 0.001), respectively. A significant inverse correlation also existed between the liver low-density lipoprotein receptor activity and the serum total cholesterol (r = -0.96, p less than 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = -0.95, p less than 0.001) but not high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It is suggested that the low-density lipoprotein receptors in human fetal liver may play a key role in the regulation of the serum cholesterol levels during gestation.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between esophageal varices and the azygos vein, which is generally considered to drain the major part of the variceal blood flow, was evaluated by percutaneous transhepatic cineportography in 35 patients with portal hypertension. We classified the patients into three groups. Those patients in whom most of the variceal blood drained into the azygos vein were designated the azygos-type group (n = 18). Those in whom most of the blood flowed into the brachiocephalic venous system were defined as the cervical-type group (n = 5), and those in whom the varices were drained by both the azygos vein and the brachiocephalic venous system were called the combined-type group (n = 12). Highly developed esophageal varices were recognized endoscopically in all patients in the combined-type and cervical-type groups, whereas some of the patients in the azygos-type group had less well-developed varices. In the azygos-type group, a tendency for the varices to be more severe as their drainage into the azygos vein became more cephalad was noted. Evaluation of the drainage of esophageal varices was considered useful not only for obtaining full comprehension of the significance of the azygos vein but also for assessing the suitability for sclerotherapy. Percutaneous transhepatic cineportography was useful for this purpose because it enables visualization of even the most minute amounts of blood flow.\r"

This series illustrates the variety of situations in which lymphoma might be diagnosed: (a) abdominal pain and hepatomegaly (three cases), (b) incidental finding at evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis (two cases), (c) secondary neoplasm after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (one case) and (d) complication of AIDS (two cases). In most cases, clinical and/or radiological features were nonspecific. However, the combination of the following features must be considered as suggestive: occurrence of an apparently primary hepatic tumor in an immunocompromised patient, absence of the usual serum tumor markers and increased serum lactic dehydrogenase activity. The final diagnosis was based on histological examination of specimens obtained by ultrasonically guided liver biopsies or at surgery. All cases belonged to unfavorable histological subtypes. Immunohistochemical findings on paraffin-embedded sections demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the seven tumors available for study. In the three patients without coexisting disease, complete remission was obtained by surgery alone or combined with chemotherapy. In the two patients with coexisting cirrhosis, outcome was rapidly unfavorable, with death occurring less than 3 mo after diagnosis. Among the three immunocompromised patients, two experienced a rapid unfavorable outcome, and the remaining one was in complete remission after surgery and chemotherapy. In conclusion, primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver arising in patients without coexisting disease has a slow progression and might be successfully treated by surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to better understand chronic liver transplant rejection, we studied 110 children and adults who survived for at least 2 mo after the transplant procedure. Chronic rejection was defined using a combination of clinical and histopathological criteria and was diagnosed in 10 of the 110 patients for an incidence of 9.1%. All 10 patients were children with the mean age 3.4 yr vs. 21.7 yr for patients without chronic rejection (p less than .001). Males and females were equally represented, and nine received a liver from a gender-matched donor. Four patients were non-Caucasian, resulting in an incidence of 21.7% in non-Caucasian recipients vs. 6.6% in Caucasian recipients (p less than .05). All chronic rejection patients received a liver from an ABO-compatible donor. T-cell crossmatch was negative in all patients in whom it was assessed, and no significant disparity in either the class I or class II human leukocyte antigen loci was noted. Patients who had chronic rejection experienced acute rejection earlier, 11 days vs. 16 days (p less than .05), than patients who did not. In 8 of 10 patients, chronic rejection appeared to evolve directly from early episodes of acute rejection that were unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy. Two distinct histological presentations were noted. One was progressive loss of bile ducts without hepatocellular injury (four patients), and the other was characterized by worsening ischemic hepatocellular damage and fibrosis (six patients) in addition to severe ductular injury. The first was associated with a more benign clinical course, the second with rapidly deteriorating hepatic function. Three patients recovered spontaneously 9 to 14 mo after transplant, one died awaiting a donor for retransplant, and five had retransplants. We conclude that chronic rejection after the operation is a relatively uncommon complication of liver transplantation with a variable clinical course and unpredictable outcome.\r"

We used the tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis method in 58 cirrhotic patients to assess its clinical applicability. Whole-body resistance, reactance and impedance were measured and compared with those of 30 healthy volunteers matched for age and sex. The resistance and impedance values of ascitic cirrhotic patients (resistance = 461 +/- 80 omega; impedance = 462 +/- 80 omega) and nonascitic cirrhotic patients (resistance = 487 +/- 96 omega; impedance = 489 +/- 97 omega) were comparable with the resistance (488 +/- 44 omega) and impedance (491 +/- 44 omega) of controls. However, a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in whole body reactance was found in patients with ascites and in those without ascites (34 +/- 9 omega vs. 47 +/- 12 omega) as compared with healthy subjects (56 +/- 7 omega). In 10 ascitic patients total body water was determined both before and after paracentesis; the volume of intraperitoneal fluid removed (7.9 +/- 3.8 L) could not be fully accounted for but only detected as an average volume of 1.9 +/- 1.0 L independently of the initial volume of the ascites. Our data clearly demonstrate that tetrapolar bioelectric impedance analysis is not adequate for measuring variations of \"compartmentalized\" fluid in the abdomen.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to assess whether markers of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection are independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in drinkers after adjustment for three known risk factors: cirrhosis, age and male sex. Among 2,015 consecutive drinkers admitted, hepatitis C virus antibodies were found by sensitive radioimmunoassay in 1,259. The following five factors have been identified and ranked as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in unidimensional and regression analysis: cirrhosis (p less than 0.001), age (p less than 0.001), male sex (p less than 0.001), presence of HBsAg (p less than 0.001) and presence of hepatitis C virus antibodies (p less than 0.03). Among drinkers with cirrhosis, the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were older (64 +/- 11 yr vs. 56 +/- 9 yr; p less than 0.001), were more often male (93% vs. 65%; p less than 0.0001) and had higher prevalence of HBsAg (9% vs. 2%; p = 0.02) and hepatitis C virus antibodies (41% vs. 26%; p = 0.02). A simple algorithm permitted us to identify a high-risk population of drinkers: the male cirrhotic patient older than 50 yr. The relative risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in this selected population was 17.7 (95% confidence interval = 9.0 to 37.5; p less than 0.0001). From a pragmatic point of view, the detection of HBsAg or hepatitis C virus antibodies, although independently associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, is not useful in increasing the diagnostic value of this algorithm because of the poor sensitivity of these tests. The weak relationships observed between hepatitis C virus antibodies and hepatocellular carcinoma needs confirmation by more accurate tests.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the effectiveness of propranolol in the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage, a double-blind, randomized trial was carried out in three centers. Patients with cirrhosis (78% alcoholic), hepatic venous pressure gradients greater than 12 mm Hg and endoscopically proven esophageal varices were randomly assigned to propranolol (51 patients) or placebo (51 patients). Of the 102 patients, 58% were Child's class A, 34% were Child's class B and 8% were Child's class C. Daily dosage was determined by the administration of progressively increasing doses of propranolol with the hepatic vein catheter in place to achieve a 25% decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient, a decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg or a decrease in resting heart rate to less than 55 beats/min. During a mean follow-up period of 16.3 mo, 11 patients in the placebo group (22%) bled from esophageal varices compared with 2 in the propranolol group (4%) during a mean period of 17.1 mo (p less than 0.01). Three additional patients (6%) in the placebo group bled from portal hypertensive gastropathy compared with none in the propranolol group. Propranolol appeared effective in preventing bleeding from large varices. Eleven deaths (22%) occurred in the placebo group compared with eight deaths (16%) in the propranolol group (NS). The mean dose of propranolol was 132 mg/day, and the median dose was 80 mg/day. Using a compliance index (pill count, clinic attendance, alcohol and propranolol levels and alcohol history), 81% of the propranolol patients and 77% of the placebo patients were considered compliant. Complications severe enough to require cessation of therapy occurred in eight patients (16%) in the propranolol group and four in the placebo group (8%) (NS). We conclude that propranolol effectively prevents the first variceal hemorrhage in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices but does not improve survival.\r"

Results were compared with those in 15 nonportal hypertensive subjects and in 24 cirrhotic patients in good condition (grade A, according to Pugh's classification). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the pulmonary artery or in the hepatic vein were not significantly different between nonportal hypertensive subjects (mean +/- S.E.M.: 271 +/- 36 and 83 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively) and presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients (273 +/- 33 and 84 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively). These concentrations were, however, elevated in cirrhotic patients (408 +/- 47 and 256 +/- 45 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 in comparison with the two other groups). These differences suggest that increased sympathetic nervous activity in cirrhosis is associated with the presence of liver disease or increase in sinusoidal pressure. Differences in plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significant among the three groups of patients. However, the existence of a significant correlation between pulmonary artery plasma epinephrine concentration and cardiac index (r2 = 0.46, p less than 0.01) in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension suggests that the adrenal medulla could play a role in the pathophysiology of the hyperkinetic syndrome of these patients.\r"

Variceal pressure was measured at endoscopy using a miniature pressure-sensitive gauge in 20 patients with portal hypertension. Measurements were obtained under baseline conditions and 20 min after double-blind administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg; n = 10) or an identical amount of placebo (normal saline, 0.3 ml/kg; n = 10). Under baseline conditions, variceal pressure was similar in propranolol and placebo groups (14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg vs. 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, respectively; not significant). Placebo had no significant effect on variceal pressure (baseline = 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; placebo = 15.5 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; not significant), and values after placebo administration were closely correlated with baseline values (r = 0.98; y = 1.1 + 0.97 x; p less than 0.0001). In contrast, propranolol caused a significant decrease in the pressure of esophageal varices (from 14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg to 11.3 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0002). No significant changes in the size of esophageal varices were observed after propranolol or placebo administration. This study shows (a) the endoscopic pressure-gauge technique has a low variability and may be used to assess acute drug-induced changes in variceal pressure; and (b) propranolol causes significant decreases in variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma, the integrated hepatitis B virus DNA patterns of the main tumor, satellites and/or metastatic lesions were analyzed by Southern-blot hybridization in 28 hepatocellular carcinomas, including three HBsAg-seronegative cases. Unicentric or multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed by histopathological criteria in 89% of the cases. Among 17 unicentric hepatocellular carcinomas, minor changes of the integration pattern--including partial loss or addition of the integration sites or both--were detected in the metastatic lesions in 29% of the cases. Furthermore, none of five cases with free-form hepatitis B virus DNA in the primary tumor had detectable free hepatitis B virus DNA in the metastatic lesions. These results suggest that the alteration of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA pattern during the course of tumor growth and metastasis may occur more often than previously perceived and that the switch-off of virus replication may be related to tumor metastatic potential. In eight cases with unilateral, multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma, two clones were detected in six cases, three were seen in another and four were seen in one. One case of note was a 9-yr-old boy with two histological types and two different integration patterns, one associated with vascular invasion and lung metastasis. Three patients with bilateral hepatocellular carcinoma were confirmed to have bicentric or tricentric hepatocellular carcinoma rather than intrahepatic dissemination and had survival rates similar to those in unicentric hepatocellular carcinoma. Three invasive HBsAg-seronegative hepatocellular carcinomas were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA integration and were of unicentric origin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, past studies involved small numbers of infected patients, and all did not use optimal culture techniques. This large study was performed using highly sensitive culture methods and sought (a) to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of pH and lactate to that of the ascitic fluid neutrophil count and (b) to determine whether evaluation of ascitic fluid pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid pH or lactate gradient) would result in improved decision-making regarding empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Analysis of 206 ascitic fluid specimens obtained in 175 patients, including 101 infected specimens, revealed that ascitic fluid (or arterial-ascitic fluid) pH and lactate were less than 50% sensitive in detecting bacterial peritonitis and that these tests did not improve clinical decision-making about empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Although statistically significant differences in ascitic fluid pH were detected between infected samples and control samples, these differences did not appear to be clinically helpful. The ascitic fluid pH was 0% sensitive in detecting the presence of bacteria in the absence of neutrophils (i.e., no such specimens had a pH lower than 7.35). Ascitic fluid pH correlated well with neutrophil count and appears to be, at least in part, an indirect measure of the presence of neutrophils in ascitic fluid. Measurement of pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid gradients) is not helpful in the clinical management of infected ascitic fluid.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor II is believed to play an important role in fetal growth and development. The insulin-like growth factor II gene expression is tissue specific and developmentally regulated. We have previously shown an enhanced level of insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA and protein in human hepatocellular carcinomas. This led to the suggestion that hepatocytes might be involved in insulin-like growth factor II expression. However, previous studies based on in situ hybridization only showed insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA in liver sinusoidal cells. This paper reports on the analysis of the expression of insulin-like growth factor II and insulin-like growth factor II, insulin-like growth factor I and insulin receptor messenger RNAs in vivo in isolated rat hepatocytes at various stages of development and in vitro in adult rat hepatocytes primary culture. Our study indicates that isolated rat hepatocytes synthesize insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA with a switch between fetal and adult messenger RNA profiles occurring 21 days after birth. In addition, adult rat hepatocytes in culture expressed insulin-like growth factor II messenger RNA and protein. Insulin-like growth factor II, insulin-like growth factor I and insulin receptor messenger RNAs were also detected. Therefore these results are consistent with the hypothesis that insulin-like growth factor II acts as an autocrine growth factor for hepatocytes in addition to having a paracrine effect. They also indicate that primary culture of hepatocytes is a good model for further studies on insulin-like growth factor II gene regulation.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the effects of diet and cimetidine on theophylline metabolism and examined interactions between these effects. Twelve men received a high-protein diet for 15 days and at another time a high-carbohydrate diet also for 15 days. Cimetidine, 800 mg daily at bedtime, was administered on days 10 through 15 of each dietary period. Theophylline metabolism was studied after the administration of a single intravenous 3 mg/kg dose on days 8 and 15 of each dietary period. Changing from a high-protein to a high-carbohydrate diet decreased theophylline clearance by about the same extent (30% +/- 10%) as treatment with cimetidine (37% +/- 5% during a high-protein diet and 30% +/- 5% during a high-carbohydrate diet). Cimetidine did not significantly influence the effects of diet on theophylline clearance. Conversely, dietary composition did not influence the degree of inhibition of theophylline metabolism induced by cimetidine. Depending on the direction of the change in protein/carbohydrate ratio, the effects of diet and cimetidine treatment were either additive (theophylline clearance was most prolonged during the high-carbohydrate regimen with concurrent cimetidine administration) or counteractive (increasing the dietary protein/carbohydrate ratio at least partially counteracted the inhibitory effect of cimetidine). In individual subjects, effects of cimetidine on theophylline metabolism were somewhat more consistent than diet-induced changes. The results are further evidence that diet and drugs can have similar effects on hepatic drug metabolism rates in humans. Variations in diet over time and individual differences in responses to diet may provide the potential for considerable instability of drug metabolism rates in free-living subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Control rats were treated with saline. Whole blood vessels of the rats were perfused by saline and stuffed with methylmethacrylated resin. Multiple nodular changes were seen in the livers after the five injections (5 wk) of N-diethylnitrosamine, and diffuse nodular transformations mimicking human cirrhosis after six injections (6 wk) were also seen. Overall changes in experimental rats were numerous vascular channels mainly composed of venous branches around the parenchymal nodules, increased arterioportal anastomoses and flattening of veins, especially hepatic vein branches. Peribiliary plexuses of the experimental rats were much richer in the vessels than those of the controls, and many dilated veins, ramified from portal vein branches, were present in the former. Direct connections between peribiliary plexuses and sinusoids or between peribiliary plexuses and portal veins increased in the experimental rats. Studies concerning microcirculatory changes of peribiliary plexuses in experimental rat cirrhosis are rare. It was concluded that the abnormal peribiliary plexuses in this experimental series might participate in a collateral circulation under a state of portal hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "Alterations in the composition of bile during cholesterol gallstone formation appear to be responsible for increased release of gallbladder mucin, a potent cholesterol nucleating agent. We investigated the effects of bile salts on release of radiolabeled glycoproteins by explants of guinea pig gallbladder in organ culture. Bile salts, in concentrations of 1 to 5 mmol/L, caused a dose-dependent release of [3H]-glycoproteins with a range of potencies in this order: chenodeoxycholate greater than deoxycholate much greater than cholate greater than ursodeoxycholate = control. Chenodeoxycholate and deoxycholate were significantly more potent than cholate (p less than 0.0001). Unconjugated and taurine-conjugated bile salts were of similar potency. Bile salts also caused increased release of glycoproteins from explants of guinea pig gastric antrum and colon. The bile salts released after bile salt exposure included mucin and lower molecular weight glycoproteins from the gallbladder. Release of glycoproteins in response to bile salts was not inhibited by indomethacin, atropine or propranolol, nor was it dependent on extracellular calcium or microtubules. Glycoprotein release in response to bile salts was associated with membrane damage as indicated by a dose-dependent leakage of the cytoplasmic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, although light microscopy did not reveal structural damage to epithelial cells. We conclude that hydrophobic bile salts stimulate gallbladder glycoprotein release in vitro by a detergent effect on the plasma membrane rather than by a receptor-mediated secretory pathway.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the role of hepatocyte calcium and cytoskeleton in activation of hyposmotic stress-induced increases in hepatocyte transmembrane potential and control of cell volume. Hepatocyte transmembrane potential was measured by glass microelectrodes in mouse liver slices before and after exposure to hyposmotic medium. Hepatocytes were loaded with tetramethylammonium by briefly exposing liver slices to nystatin, a cation poreforming antibiotic. Changes in hepatocyte steady-state water volume were determined by changes in intracellular tetramethylammonium activity measured with tetramethylammonium-sensitive, double-barrel micro-electrodes 4 min after exposure to hyposmotic medium. Hyposmotic stress of 74% of the control osmolality (approximately 280 mOsm) hyperpolarized hepatocyte transmembrane potential by 1.83 times the control hepatocyte transmembrane potential, and cell water volume increased by a factor of 1.19. The Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (100 mumol/L) completely inhibited hyposmotic stress-induced hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential. This inhibitory effect diminished at doses of 37.5 or 50 mumol/L, but even these hyperpolarizations were decreased significantly compared with control. Hyposmotic stress during added verapamil dosage (50 mumol/L) also resulted in 23% greater cell swelling compared with control. Ca(2+)-free medium plus ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (5 mmol/L) inhibited hyposmotic stress-induced increases in hepatocyte transmembrane potential and resulted in 16% greater cell swelling compared with control. Calmodulin inhibitors trifluoperazine (100 mumol/L) and promethazine (100 mumol/L) inhibited the hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential caused by hyposmolality, as did 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl ester) (50 mumol/L), which inhibits mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Cytochalasin B (50 mumol/L), which disrupts microfilaments, also inhibited hyperpolarization of hepatocyte transmembrane potential with osmotic stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

HVP typically contains 10-30% MSG. Case studies are presented in which the elimination of all food sources of MSG resulted in decreased headache frequency. Information and food lists helpful in identifying dietary MSG and HVP are presented.

The five MMPI clusters replicated previous findings in the chronic pain literature. These MMPI cluster groups were compared to 5 diagnostic categories (migraine, cluster, post-trauma, tension, mixed). No relationship was found between cluster type and headache diagnosis. While the diagnostic groups were found to differ on measures of pain severity, sex and age, cluster groups did not. It is proposed that MMPI scale types reflect a patient's response to pain and are more likely to be the result of coping resources than headache-related personality style. Future research with additional, non-pain populations and prospective studies is suggested.\r"

Based on weekly headache index, headache-free days, dysfunctional days and patients' general well-being rating and physicians' global assessment, two thirds of the patients improved significantly. The common side effects included weight gain, tremor, hair loss and nausea. Liver functions were unaffected by treatment. The possible mechanism of action of valproate in headache is discussed.

In the six samples with HLA-DR positive epithelium the numbers of IL-2R positive cells in the lamina propria were strongly increased, ranging between 75 and 90%. HLA-DR expression by cervical epithelium was observed in only two of 12 samples from patients with mixed epithelial non-virus related abnormalities. No increase in the numbers of IL-2R positive cells was observed in this group of patients. Additionally, no significant differences in terms of T lymphocyte infiltrate were found among the three groups. The results indicate that wart virus infection is associated with enhanced HLA-DR epithelial expression and they lend support to the concept that in the human cervix the epithelium actively participates in the local immune response.\r"

  ".W": "The leucocyte antigen CD23 is expressed by B lymphocytes following activation by a number of stimuli and functions as an IgE receptor, and in its soluble form, as a putative B cell growth factor. The expression of CD23 on the surface of lymphocytes in paraffin wax sections of synovial biopsy specimens was studied using a novel mouse monoclonal antibody, BU38. Specimens were investigated from nine cases of rheumatoid arthritis, six cases of osteoarthritis, and eight cases of chronic inflammation in articular and non-articular tissues. CD23 was expressed on a high proportion of lymphocytes in all forms of chronic inflammation and was not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. It may be a characteristic feature of any chronic inflammatory response. As CD23 was found on the surface of lymphocytes in many cases of these arthritides, sCD23 in serum or synovial fluid may yet prove a useful marker for the severity of the inflammatory infiltrate.\r"

  ".W": "At the height of the United Kingdom influenza A epidemic in December 1989, three children receiving treatment for non-T cell acute leukaemia developed pancytopenia with concomitant influenza A infection. Bone marrow histology showed prominent marrow erythrophagocytosis by morphologically mature histiocytes, consistent with the picture of virus associated haemophagocytic syndrome (VAHS). In two cases there was an initial spontaneous recovery, though recurrence of VAHS developed in one case in association with a different viral infection (cytomegalovirus) following autologous bone marrow transplantation. The third child died from cardiorespiratory failure secondary to infection with influenza A and Klebsiella pneumoniae sepsis. It is suggested that influenza A should be added to the list of infective causative agents.\r"
