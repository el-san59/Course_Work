  ".W": "We have investigated the use of constant-rate delivery of fentanyl by i.v. and transdermal routes for the treatment of pain after major surgery. Forty-five males, ASA I-III, received in a double-blinded fashion either placebo (n = 6) or fentanyl (n = 39) i.v. at one of four dose rates (25, 50, 100 or 125 micrograms h-1). Stable serum concentrations of fentanyl were produced by the end of surgery and were maintained for a total of 24 h. Calculated clearance of fentanyl was 1.05 +/- 0.38 litre min-1 and was not related to weight or age. Both the 100- and 125-micrograms h-1 dose rates produced significant analgesic efficacy as assessed by postoperative morphine requirements. Mean serum concentrations of fentanyl in these groups were 1.42 +/- 0.14 (SD) and 1.90 +/- 0.30 ng ml-1, respectively. One of 10 patients receiving fentanyl 100 micrograms h-1 and three of nine patients receiving 125 micrograms h-1 had evidence of respiratory depression. Eight additional patients were treated with a transdermal drug delivery system containing fentanyl (TTS-fentanyl). Steady-state serum concentrations in this group were 2.15 +/- 0.92 (SD) ng ml-1. Post-operative morphine requirements were minimal (less than 0.5 mg h-1) and PaCO2 remained acceptable in all patients. Serum concentrations of fentanyl increased slowly (15 h to plateau) and decreased slowly (apparent half-life, 21 h). We conclude that delivery of analgesic doses of fentanyl is feasible by the transdermal route.\r"

Fentanyl was administered as a 2-min i.v. infusion at doses of 15 micrograms kg-1 for elderly patients and 20 micrograms kg-1 for the younger patients. Plasma samples were obtained for 4 h and fentanyl concentrations determined by radioimmunoassay. Fentanyl concentration, per microgram kg-1 administered, was higher in elderly than in young patients at 2 min (7.73 +/- 3.14 v. 4.54 +/- 1.83 ng ml-1 (mean +/- SD), respectively) and at 4 min after the start of infusion (3.26 +/- 1.44 v. 1.78 +/- 0.72 ng ml-1, respectively). Concentrations were similar at all other sampling times. Pharmacokinetic variables were determined by non-compartmental techniques. Total plasma clearance was similar for the two age groups. Volume of distribution at steady-state (VDss) was smaller in elderly patients (1.36 +/- 0.44 v. 2.27 +/- 0.82 litre kg-1). Despite age-related changes in VDss, plasma fentanyl concentrations for the two groups were similar throughout the 4-h sampling period except immediately following administration. These results suggest that, if there are age-related differences in response to fentanyl, the likely pharmacokinetic explanation is the higher concentration of fentanyl in the elderly immediately following its administration.\r"

The area under the curve (0-240 min) was similarly reduced in the group with rectal administration (P less than 0.05). Compared with the i.v. data, approximately 40% systemic availability occurred after rectal application, although considerable individual variation was noted. In one child very high plasma concentrations were observed after rectal administration, possibly as a result of redistribution/recirculation phenomena. The average results are similar to those obtained when other opioids are given rectally.\r"

Morphine 2.5 mg i.v. was given, as required, in the postoperative period and pain score, respiratory rate and PaCO2 measured every 2 h.

Consumption of supplementary morphine was significantly lower in both intrathecal groups (P less than 0.01). Mean PaCO2 was significantly higher in patients given intrathecal morphine 2 mg. This was significant at 12, 14 and 16 h after induction of anaesthesia. Respiratory rate did not differ significantly between the groups. Postoperative PEFR was significantly better in patients given intrathecal morphine (P less than 0.01).

For a period of 1 h following injection plasma concentrations of adrenaline were measured by high pressure liquid chromatography and serum concentrations of lignocaine by gas chromatography. The addition of dextran caused a significant reduction in the absorption of both adrenaline and lignocaine from the injection site. It is concluded that the dextran adjuvant constitutes a protective mechanism against toxic systemic side effects in local anaesthesia using adrenaline-containing anaesthetic solutions. This effect is particularly significant in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease and when local anaesthetic solutions are used in combination with volatile anaesthetics.\r"

Following the intubating dose of atracurium 0.4 mg kg-1 and after the recovery of single twitch to 5-10% of control (monitored by evoked EMG of hypothenar muscle), an infusion of atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 h-1 was started. In 22 of the patients this initial rate resulted in the desired steady state; 32 patients required one, and 21 required two or more adjustments in rate. The mean single twitch value at steady-state was 6.6 +/- 0.3% (SEM), which is equal to 93% neuromuscular block. The infusion requirement to maintain the steady state neuromuscular block in all paediatric patients more than 1 month old was constant (0.53 +/- 0.01 mg kg-1 h-1).

Both local anaesthetics caused the expected depression of global haemodynamic function. Regional myocardial systolic shortening was depressed similarly by both agents. Regional myocardial dysfunction, seen as post-systolic shortening, occurred to a similar extent with both lignocaine and bupivacaine. Coronary blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure were significantly correlated during the administration of lignocaine; bupivacaine had erratic effects on coronary blood flow and no correlation between coronary blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure was seen. These results suggest that regional myocardial dysfunction occurs with both local anaesthetics and does not account for the apparent increased cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine. Bupivacaine did, however, cause wider individual variations compared with lignocaine with respect to coronary blood flow.\r"

Halothane (0.25-1.25 vol%) depressed postsynaptic excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurones in response to activation of stratum radiatum synaptic inputs, and concentration-dependent excitatory (0.25-1.25 vol%) and depressant (1.5-2.0 vol%) actions were observed on dentate granule neurone excitability and perforant path evoked synaptic responses. In contrast, isoflurane increased CA1 neurone excitability (0.25-0.75 vol%) and produced postsynaptic depression of dentate neurones (0.5-4.0 vol%). Enflurane also increased CA1 excitability (0.5-4.0 vol%), but depressed synaptic responses at equivalent concentrations, and produced mixed excitatory (0.25-1.0 vol%) and depressant (1.0-4.0 vol%) effects on dentate synaptic responses. Differential actions were also observed for the three anaesthetics on stratum oriens excitatory inputs to CA1 neurones, and on antidromic responses. A good correlation (r = 0.992) exists between the membrane/buffer partition coefficients of these anaesthetics and their half-maximal concentrations for depression of synaptic responses; however, this correlation does not reflect the different, anaesthetic-specific actions observed. The results indicate that inhalation anaesthetics act at multiple and selective hydrophobic recognition sites which are heterogenously distributed on different synaptic pathways.\r"

The impact of anaesthetic-induced action on enzyme activity and diazepam binding to human serum albumin (HSA) was assessed in protein free and protein containing buffers, respectively. Human serum albumin reduced the elimination of diazepam by 12 and 50% at concentrations of 1 and 10 mg ml-1, respectively. In the absence of albumin, halothane 1 mmol litre-1 reduced the elimination of diazepam by 13%, whereas enflurane at 1.5 mmol litre-1 caused a reduction of 8%. No effect was seen from isoflurane 1 mmol litre-1 and trifluoroacetic acid 4 mmol litre-1. In the presence of the highest concentration of albumin, however, an increased elimination of diazepam of 24% resulted from exposure to enflurane and trifluoroacetic acid, while no statistically significant changes were seen for isoflurane and halothane. The present work supports the view that volatile anaesthetic agents may cause pharmacokinetic drug interactions by interference with both enzyme activity and drug protein binding.\r"

These differences were significant (P less than 0.001). It is concluded that bilateral intercostal blocks may inhibit the glucose response to surgery, but have no effect on the cortisol response.\r"

The SCC-RAG titres were significantly raised in four of five patients with pemphigus, while they remained within the normal range in the other dermatoses except in one case. In three pemphigus cases in whom serial measurements were made, SCC-RAG levels seemed to be related to disease activity. The SCC-RAG levels in blister fluids were much higher than those in serum, suggesting that the skin is a major source of serum SCC-RAG. These results show that SCC-RAG is increased not only in SCC, but also in some cases of pemphigus, and suggest that pemphigus antibodies may cause the production or release of SCC-RAG.\r"

A hydroxypropyl methylcellulose gel seemed to be the most promising alternative to petrolatum. It gave high bioavailability of the nickel and had good film forming properties leaving the nickel spread across the skin surface as a thin film without microscopically detectable crystals. The content of nickel in the various skin layers after cutaneous application was determined, and nickel was found to accumulate in the epidermis, probably due to epidermal binding. A significant amount of nickel was found also in the dermis. Occlusion and application of higher nickel concentrations increased the transport rate and must be considered in patch testing using this hydrogel. We conclude that nickel permeation is highly dependent of the choice of vehicle and the vehicle should, therefore, be an important consideration in patch testing with nickel.\r"

The absorption of hydrocortisone caused a significantly higher mean rise of serum cortisol in 20 children with severe dermatitis (Group A) than in 17 children with moderate dermatitis (Group B). The mean post-application rise of serum cortisol in 18 children with mild dermatitis (Group C) was significantly lower than in the children with moderate dermatitis. There was a significant negative linear correlation between age and the post-application rise of serum cortisol in Groups A and C. In these groups the mean post-application rise of serum cortisol was significantly higher in children aged under 18 months than in children aged 18 months or over. Severe widespread dermatitis and an age under 18 months are two relevant risk factors in the topical use of hydrocortisone.\r"

Using exponential expressions for radioactivity in skin surface biopsies as a function of SC depth, and total SC radioactivity as a function of time, a mathematical model was developed to calculate the rate of loss of steroid through superficial shedding and the rate of transfer of steroid from the SC into the epidermis. When a topical steroid was applied for 8 h under gauze occlusion, over 80% was recovered from the gauze.\r"

Inversion of the recording chart gives a plot of the central visual field. In this study we have shown that in 64 eyes of 37 patients, with unequivocal field loss attending a glaucoma clinic, the test is efficient and reliable when compared with conventional static (Dicon 3000) and kinetic (Tubingen Oculus) field tests. The results were identical in 88% of eyes tested and approximately comparable in another 6%. Quantitative equivalent targets for the different methods are described. Oculokinetic perimetry was carried out by a previously untrained person, and it is suggested that this new method merits further study as a screening device for glaucoma in the community.\r"

Success declined to 45% at 42 months. No significant difference was noted when (a) first lasered eyes of all patients and those fellow eyes treated were analysed separately, (b) when right and left eyes were analysed separately, nor (c) when patients were divided into two treatment groups, (I) 100 burns at 1 W, and (II) 65 burns at 850 mW. Eight of 11 eyes showed progressive postlaser field loss despite below-baseline intraocular pressures. ALT is an alternative to carbonic anhydrase inhibitor therapy, with a success rate of 66.7% at two years. However, repeat ALT was successful in only 25% of patients seven months after treatment.\r"

The implant slowly breaks down and stimulates a simple macrophagic reaction: fibrosis in the overlying choroid is associated with ischaemic gliosis and chorioretinal fusion.\r"

Records showed that an epidemic of influenza A H2N2 was present in that year, and the study shows that JCA patients born in 1963 still have a higher level of antibody to influenza A H2N2 than JCA patients born in other years or age-matched controls. This elevation is not seen in a survey of three control viruses. Since this group developed their clinical JCA after the appearance of influenza A H3N2 in 1977, it is suggested that these patients developed a progressive arthropathy because they had been pre-sensitized to influenza A by contact with an earlier strain when in utero.\r"

Bone marrow lymphocytosis, a decreased percentage of PMN in bone marrow differential counts and an impaired in vitro growth of colony-forming unit-PMN macrophage were also related to an increased incidence of infection but were predominantly present in patients with less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l circulating PMN. The maximal response in the number of circulating PMN measured after injection of epinephrine and hydrocortisone varied substantially within patients, but those with less than 0.1 x 10(9)/l PMN always had lower responses than those with greater than 0.1 x 10(9)/l PMN. These variables did not therefore contribute to the identification of FS patients at risk of infection.\r"

All affected patients were elderly women who had a poor diet and were virtually housebound. Additional risk factors in two cases were partial gastrectomy and occult coeliac disease. Biochemical screening was of limited value in differential diagnosis, since elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels were noted in both osteomalacic and non-osteomalacic patients. This study indicates that, in the West of Scotland at least, osteomalacia is a common, easily overlooked and treatable cause of morbidity in elderly patients with RA.\r"

  ".U": "88241335\r", 
  ".W": "Investigation of motor function in a group of 17 patients with Huntington's disease reveals that, in addition to the chorea that many patients exhibit, defects in voluntary motor performance also are evident. Fast simple wrist flexion movements to 15 degrees or 60 degrees were slower, and individual movements showed greater variability than seen in normal subjects. This bradykinesia was most pronounced in those patients who were akinetic and rigid, but also was seen in those with chorea alone; bradykinesia was independent of the drug treatment that the patients were receiving (and was therefore not due to drug-induced parkinsonism). The electromyographic activity of the agonist muscles during such simple but slow movement differed from that seen in Parkinson's disease. The performance of complex movements revealed further deficits. Some patients were unable to combine two movements in a simultaneous or sequential movement task of squeezing the hand and flexing the elbow. Those who could perform these complex movements exhibited slowing of the velocity of the movement and prolongation of the interval between movements. These abnormalities were present in patients with chorea who were not taking neuroleptic drugs. It is argued that they represent an abnormality of motor programming of complex movements, over and above the defect in executing simple movements. The long latency stretch reflexes in wrist flexor muscles and flexor pollicis longus were reduced or absent, but this did not correlate with changes in motor performance, or with the reduced size of the early components of cortical sensory evoked potentials. Bradykinesia is thus shown to be an integral component of the motor disorder of Huntington's disease, in addition to the chorea. The coexistence of bradykinesia and chorea in this illness is compatible with current theories of the role of the basal ganglia in the control of movement.\r"

While maintaining fixation on the centre of a visual display, subjects made simple reaction time (RT) key press responses on detecting visual targets which appeared above, below, to the left or right, equidistant from fixation. On each trial the target was preceded by a preparatory cue, either a peripheral luminance change or a central arrow, to summon attention to one of the four locations. The orienting of attention was measured as a facilitation in detection RT at the cued location. For the parkinsonian controls, this facilitation was equal for horizontal and vertical directions, whereas for both types of cues, PSP patients were slower moving attention in the vertical than in the horizontal plane. Midbrain retinotectal pathways are important not only for controlling eye movements, but also for orienting attention.\r"

Recent neurophysiological studies indicate that these maps are potentially modifiable through alterations in their sensory input. We present evidence that the apparent shape and orientation of the body can be changed within seconds by using muscle vibration to generate proprioceptive misinformation about limb position. Depending on the position of the hands or feet in relation to the rest of the body and to the test chamber, it is possible to generate systematic perceptual distortions of the body and changes in the apparent orientation of the body. Some implications of these observations for the maintenance of an accurate body schema, for spatial orientation, and for the encoding of ocular position are described.\r"

  ".W": "A wide range of cognitive impairments can be observed in patients with Parkinson's disease. A close parallel exists between these deficits and those found following damage to prefrontal cortex. Anatomical evidence is reviewed which reveals a complex pattern of neuronal circuits connecting the frontal cortex and basal ganglia. All these circuits are in some way dependent upon dopamine, suggesting that changes in the levels of dopamine stimulation may alter performance on 'frontal' tests. To test this hypothesis, a group of patients with Parkinson's disease were assessed both on and off levodopa treatment, on a range of tests selected from the human and animal experimental literature as being sensitive to disruption of prefrontal cortex. A variable pattern of results was obtained. On one test, a measure of verbal fluency, patients were impaired, compared with normal controls, only when off levodopa. On two measures, associative conditional learning and subject-ordered pointing, patients were impaired only when on levodopa, while on the final measures, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, patients were impaired both on and off levodopa. Two mechanisms are discussed to explain these results, one based on the effects of dopamine depletion, and the other based on the adverse effects of dopamine overstimulation. The results suggest that different areas of prefrontal cortex are involved in the tasks employed, and that functional levels of dopamine in separate areas of cortex and caudate may differ crucially in Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".U": "88241340\r", 
  ".W": "In recent years, several attempts have been made to characterize the nature of the cognitive deficits shown by patients with Parkinson's disease. It has been suggested variously that they have difficulty in switching cognitive set, in performing effortful (or controlled) as opposed to automatic tasks, or that their impairment is found in tasks which maximize the amount of 'self-directed task specific planning'. It is proposed that this latter distinction may be reformulated in terms of the degree of internal versus external attentional control which is required by the task. An experiment is described which attempted to manipulate this parameter. A version of the Stroop colour-word test was used, in which the words 'red' and 'green' were presented in the complementary coloured 'ink'. Subjects responded either to the colour of the ink in which the word was written or the colour named by the word. The relevant attribute changed at intervals during the course of the experiment. In one condition, the relevant stimulus attribute was cued before each trial. In another condition, subjects had to remember which attribute was currently relevant. Results revealed that patients with Parkinson's disease were impaired mainly on the second version of the task which required internal attentional control. The results are discussed in relation to the models of Working Memory (Baddeley, 1986), and attentional control (Norman and Shallice, 1980). Exploration of these models leads to the formulation of a theory in which the crucial determinant of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease is reduced resources in the Supervisory Attentional System. Provided the demands of the task are within the patient's available attentional resources the patient may not show any deficit. If, however, the attentional demands exceed available resources, as in tasks which depend upon internal cues, then deficits will be observed.\r"

  ".U": "88241341\r", 
  ".W": "The perceptual completion phenomenon refers to seeing a figure as complete when part of it falls in a blind area of the visual field. This phenomenon and the conditions for its occurrence were examined in three different situations: over the retinal blind spot, across the midline of the visual field in commissurotomized patients, and in the blind visual field in hemianopic patients. Responses of complete perception were obtained in each of the three conditions, but they were not all the result of a genuine perceptual completion process. Reports of vision over the retinal blind spot qualified as genuine perceptual completion. In the other two situations, reports suggestive of completion could be entirely eliminated in all but one hemianopic patient by manipulating parameters inherently involved in the evaluation of perceptual completion. The nature of perception, the characteristics and properties of the experimental task and stimuli, the mode of response, the patient's mental status, and eccentric eye fixation, all contributed towards reports of complete perception for reasons other than a process of completing the missing information. Evidence of completion was found in one patient who could see more distinctly in his affected field with bilateral stimulation than with stimulation of the affected field alone. The results suggest that perceptual completion in the hemianopic field is not a common phenomenon and that reports of complete perception are determined by many factors, not all related to seeing more than is objectively available. The results also indicate that the hemianopic defect does not function as an extended blind spot. Possible mechanisms underlying perceptual completion over the blind spot and the hemianopic field are suggested.\r"

Patients with posterior circulation lesions involving the brainstem and/or cerebellum demonstrated a significantly lower frequency of depression than patients with MCA lesions or patients with posterior circulation lesions involving the left cerebral hemisphere. Moreover, depression following brainstem and/or cellebellar infarcts was of significantly shorter duration than depression following MCA lesions. These differences in the frequency and duration of depression following brainstem/cerebellar as compared with MCA lesions were not explained by differences in lesion volume, physical impairment, cognitive deficits or quality of social support. They suggest that PC and MCA induced depression may have different aetiologies.\r"

  ".W": "Motor-point stimulation using insulated microelectrodes has been used to assess the cerebral projection from a number of single muscles in the human upper limb. Previous studies with intrafascicular neural stimulation have revealed a short-latency cortical projection from group I muscle afferents of intrinsic muscles of the hand but this technique is unsuitable to study the projection of afferents from proximal muscles. In 6 subjects, stimuli were delivered to the motor point of the following muscles: anterior deltoid, biceps brachii (short head), flexor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum communis, abductor pollicis brevis and first dorsal interosseous. The mean latency of the early cortical negativity was 15.0 ms for deltoid, 16.4 ms for biceps, 18.8 ms for flexor carpi radialis, 18.8 ms for extensor digitorum communis, 21.9 ms for abductor pollicis brevis and 25.0 ms for first dorsal interosseous. The amplitude of cerebral potentials from individual muscles was smaller than that produced by stimulation of the digital nerves of the index or little finger and did not vary systematically between proximal and distal muscles. This study provides direct evidence for a short-latency cortical projection from proximal muscles of the upper limb. The results are consistent with psychophysical studies which have proposed a role for intramuscular receptors in kinaesthesia at both proximal and distal joints.\r"

Motor deficit may begin proximally or distally in the extremities and sensory deficit is sometimes, but not always present. Longitudinal studies were performed in 13 patients, starting during the progressive phase. The severity of the clinical deficit was related to the amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) and sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs). Two patterns were detected, but could only be reliably distinguished during the progressive phase of the disease. (1) A length-dependent reduction of the CMAP, i.e., a progressive decrease of the CMAP on moving the stimulating electrode to more proximal stimulation sites. This could often be attributed to conduction block. In this pattern (Group A), the sensory potentials were spared with only 1 exception. These patients had motor involvement without sensory deficit and the myotatic reflexes could be preserved up to MRC grade 3 paresis. (2) A simple reduction of the CMAP, i.e., the amplitude decreased during clinical deterioration, but during a single investigation remained similar for stimulation at all levels of the nerve. In this pattern (Group B), motor and sensory fibres were similarly involved. These patients showed both motor and sensory deficit and early myotatic areflexia. The second pattern might be explained by an immunological mechanism with a predilection for those regions of the peripheral nervous system where the blood-nerve barrier is naturally deficient. In the first pattern the discrepancy between the involvement of motor and sensory fibres raises new questions, the solution of which might be of importance for the understanding of the Guillain-Barre syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Presynaptic inhibition of homonymous Ia afferent terminals to soleus, quadriceps and tibialis anterior motoneurons and of heteronymous Ia fibres from quadriceps to soleus was compared in the same subjects when standing without support and during a control situation (sitting or standing with back support). Changes in presynaptic inhibition of Ia fibres were indirectly deduced from alterations in the amount of monosynaptic Ia facilitation elicited in motoneurons by a constant conditioning stimulation. Facilitation was measured during the first 0.5 ms when the monosynaptic Ia excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was not yet contaminated by polysynaptic effects evoked by the conditioning stimulation. Two indirect methods were used to provide an estimate of the size of the conditioning Ia EPSP: (1) the resulting H reflex facilitation; and (2) the peak of increased firing probability elicited in voluntarily activated motoneurons by stimulation of homonymous and heteronymous Ia fibres (poststimulus time histogram PSTH method). Only those PSTH experiments in which the 'spontaneous' firing rate of the motor unit was identical in the different positions, thus ensuring an identical net synaptic drive to the motoneuron, were considered. Under these conditions it is assumed that changes in the size of the peak of facilitation elicited by the monosynaptic Ia volley are likely to be caused by changes in presynaptic inhibition of Ia fibres. It is argued that the substantial changes in monosynaptic Ia excitation observed when standing without support probably reflect changes in presynaptic inhibition of Ia fibres. Under this interpretation, presynaptic inhibition of Ia fibres to soleus motoneurons is increased while standing without support, whereas presynaptic inhibition of homonymous Ia fibres to quadriceps motoneurons is decreased. There is no evidence for a change in presynaptic inhibition of Ia fibres to tibialis anterior motoneurons. The resulting alterations in the gain of the monosynaptic reflex of these muscles are discussed in relation to the possible role of the monosynaptic stretch reflex in human gait.\r"

Upper lip (UL), lower lip (LL), and jaw (J) kinematics for nonstuttered speech behaviours in stutterers and normal speakers were examined using quantitative indices of normal multiple movement coordination reported in recent studies of gait, reaching, grasping, and speech. While two measures of coordination--dynamic movement composition and intermovement motor equivalence--did not distinguish between stutterers and normals, stutterers manifested striking differences from normal on a third measure, the sequencing of UL, LL, and J movement onsets and velocity peaks. These findings suggest that, contrary to previous hypotheses, stutterers do not manifest general problems of coordination of speech movement. Instead, stuttering appears to be associated with a specific impairment in multiple movement coordination associated with sequencing of those movements.\r"

Our results show differences in the time course of subjective self-evaluation of drunkenness in the presence of naloxone. Also, changes are observed in naloxone pharmacokinetic parameters with the ingestion of alcohol, specifically a decrease in plasma clearance. Whereas the cortisol response induced by naloxone was greater in the subgroup of participants with positive expectancy, in the presence of alcohol the naloxone effect on cortisol response was not observed. These observations may help explain the observed reversal of alcohol-induced coma by naloxone in a subgroup of patients.\r"

Headache ratings were also significantly correlated (rho = 0.70; p less than 0.0001) with peak concentrations of m-CPP in plasma.

Alternate explanations for the patient's symptoms were well accepted in almost all cases, and subsequent performance in the treatment program appeared to be independent of serum level.

We have evaluated the electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of chronic oral treatment with either clonidine (0.2 to 0.5 mg every 12 hours; n = 7) or another centrally active alpha 2-agonist, tiamenidine (0.5 to 1.5 mg every 12 hours; n = 7), in otherwise healthy hypertensive human volunteers. At dosages that modestly lowered diastolic blood pressure, both agents significantly slowed sinus rate and increased the atrial pacing rate producing AV nodal Wenckebach. Clonidine also significantly increased corrected sinus node recovery time and lowered cardiac output while similar (but statistically insignificant) trends were seen with tiamenidine. We conclude that chronic oral treatment with these alpha 2-agonists depresses sinus and AV nodal function in virtually all subjects, including those without manifest conduction system disease.\r"

A 32-night experimental protocol in the sleep laboratory was instituted consisting of four placebo-baseline nights followed by 4 weeks of drug administration. Both doses of nadolol had a clear-cut and consistent lowering effect on blood pressure throughout the night and during the day, with a greater reduction noted with the 80 mg dose. In fact, blood pressure values were reduced to normotensive levels. Neither dose had a disrupting effect on sleep, whereas the 80 mg dose improved sleep efficiency and also had a rapid eye movement-enhancing effect. This absence of sleep-disrupting effects is attributed to nadolol's low level of lipophilicity and lack of intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. The clinical significance of the lack of sleep disruption and possible improvement of sleep with nadolol is discussed in light of the well-recognized sleep disturbances produced by other beta-blockers.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cimetidine or ranitidine administration on responses to single and multiple doses of nifedipine were studied in 11 subjects who received cimetidine (300 mg q.i.d.) and 12 who received ranitidine (150 mg b.i.d.) in combination with nifedipine. After single doses of nifedipine, cimetidine decreased apparent oral clearance (dose/AUC) from 66 +/- 32 L/hr to 33 +/- 14 L/hr (p less than 0.01); elimination half-life increased from 4.0 +/- 2.2 to 4.9 +/- 2.9 hours (p less than 0.07). Increases in heart rate were greater (26 +/- 13 vs 13 +/- 11 beats/min standing; 19 +/- 11 vs 9 +/- 9 beats/min supine) and lasted longer than after nifedipine alone. Hypotensive effects were similar (10 +/- 7 mm Hg decrease vs 9 +/- 9 mm Hg). During nifedipine multiple-dose administration, cimetidine decreased the apparent oral clearance from 76 +/- 39 to 43 +/- 20 L/hr (p less than 0.01). Blood pressure responses were not altered by cimetidine but heart rate increased more (18 +/- 9 vs 9 +/- 9 beats/min supine; 18 +/- 13 vs 13 +/- 14 beats/min standing). Ranitidine coadministration did not alter nifedipine elimination or dynamic responses. During administration of nifedipine alone, the ratio of oral clearances (multiple to single doses) was 1.1 +/- 0.5. Thus (1) cimetidine but not ranitidine alters responses to nifedipine and (2) nifedipine kinetics do not differ between single- vs multiple-dose conditions.\r"

With the hypothesis that the decrease in CLR was due to the low-protein and not the low-caloric content of the diet, we studied the CLR of oxypurinol, uric acid, creatinine, and inulin in normal subjects during isocaloric (2600 calories per 70 kg per day), normal-protein (150 gm per day), and low-protein (19 gm per day) diets. There were three major findings: (1) the CLR of oxypurinol declined from 26.6 +/- 1.8 ml/min on the normal-protein diet to 13.5 +/- 1.4 ml/min on the isocaloric low-protein diet (p less than 0.05); (2) the CLR of inulin and creatinine fell 14% and 20%, respectively, on the low-protein diet compared with the normal-protein diet (both p less than 0.05); and (3) there was a diurnal variation in the CLR of oxypurinol. We conclude that the decreased CLR of oxypurinol was the result of the reduced protein content of the diet and the CLR of both inulin and creatinine were decreased on the low-protein diet.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between contact allergy to formaldehyde and positive patch test reactions to DMDM hydantoin was investigated. 35 formaldehyde-allergic patients were patch tested with serial dilutions of formaldehyde (0.1%-0.3%-1.0% aq.) and DM hydantoin (the non-formaldehyde-containing parent compound of DMDM hydantoin). 21 were also patch tested with MDM hydantoin (1 molecule formaldehyde) in serial dilutions: 7 (33%) reacted to 1 or more concentrations. The other 14 were also tested with DMDM hydantoin (2 molecules formaldehyde) in serial dilutions: 8 (57%) reacted to 1 or more concentrations. Patients patch-test-positive to formaldehyde 0.1% and/or 0.3% tended to show more patch test reactivity to (D)MDM hydantoin than those who reacted only to 1%. Aqueous solutions of (D)MDM hydantoin in concentrations as used in cosmetic products therefore contain enough free formaldehyde to cause dermatitis in a patch test system in some formaldehyde-allergic patients: 12 such patients applied a cream containing 1% DMDM hydantoin to the flexor aspect of the lower arm twice daily for 1 week; 4 (33%) developed dermatitis. The use of a cream containing 0.25% DMDM hydantoin in these 4 patients still caused dermatitis in 1 and provoked itching in another. An increase in the use of DMDM hydantoin in cosmetic products will also inevitable increase the risk of cosmetic dermatitis in consumers allergic to formaldehyde.\r"

The following tentative conclusions were drawn. (i) Contact allergy to diazolidinyl urea may or may not be due to formaldehyde sensitivity. (ii) Patients allergic to formaldehyde may suffer contact allergic reactions from the use of cosmetics containing diazolidinyl urea. (iii) Patients sensitized to diazolidinyl urea may cross-react to imidazolidinyl urea and vice-versa.

Patch tests showed positive reactions to Lu-Shen-Wan and to one of its 6 ingredients, Venenum Bufonis. A study in 15 control patients showed that 13 had positive reactions to 50% Lu-Shen-Wan and 50% Venenum Bufonis but that only 2 showed mild reactions when the concentration of the latter was reduced to 5%. The results suggest that Venenum Bufonis in Lu-Shen-Wan can cause irritant contact dermatitis. The present paper demonstrates that a Western dermatological investigative method, the patch test, is applicable to traditional medicine in confirming the cause of contact dermatitis from a Chinese herbal preparation and in identifying the causative ingredient. Such knowledge is very useful for the improvement of the preparation by reducing the concentration of the irritant, by removing it or by substituting it with an alternative non-irritant substance.\r"

Differences in potency are observed among these 3 compounds, and the possible reasons for this are discussed. Isoeugenol fails to elicit a sensitisation response when challenged onto guinea pigs sensitised to methyl dodecane sulphonate, indicating that the mechanism of isoeugenol sensitisation is not based on methyl transfer. It is proposed that, in skin sensitisation involving small haptenic groups, antigenic specificity is directed not against the haptenic groups but against portions of the carrier protein whose configuration has been modified as a result of the carrier-hapten reaction. This concept is supported by published data on cross-reactivity patterns with enantiomeric pairs of alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone derivatives.\r"

Seventy patients were randomized, all underwent mechanical bowel preparation and received oral neomycin and erythromycin base. Thirty-four patients also received a preoperative and four postoperative doses of cefamandole, while 36 patients were randomized to receive no parenteral antibiotics. The two groups were well stratified for age, sex, and risk factors. The Dukes stage was similar and the surgical procedures were equally distributed in the two groups. There were no wound infections in the 34 patients receiving cefamandole and only one wound infection (2.8 percent) in the 36 control patients. Therefore, the addition of perioperative intravenous cefamandole to a good mechanical bowel preparation with oral antibiotics was of no benefit in reducing wound infections following resection of colorectal malignancies in this select group of patients.\r"

The authors interviewed 255 women who underwent colonoscopy at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center between 1983 and 1985 with a telephone-administered structured questionnaire. Eleven interviews were excluded for various reasons. Overall, 57.7 percent of the 244 interviewees used vitamin pills on a regular basis (at least once a week for a year); 6.6 percent of the interviewees used vitamin A, 20.7 percent used vitamin C, and 16.2 percent used vitamin E. There were no statistically significant differences in vitamin usage among women with adenomatous polyps of the colon (105 cases), women with colon cancer (56 cases), and women without colonic neoplasia (83 cases). Despite widespread use of supplementary vitamins, this study failed to demonstrate major benefits in preventing colon polyps or cancer.\r"

Anal manometry was performed and sensation to mucosal electrostimulation and temperature change in the lower, middle, and upper zones of the anal canal assessed. Thermal sensation was impaired in the hemorrhoid group as compared with controls, but not to the same degree as in IFI (e.g., median thermal sensitivity in mid anal canal, control 0.9 degrees C, hemorrhoid 1.2 degrees C, IFI 2.0 degrees C, P less than .05 and less than .001, respectively). The correlation between the two tests of sensation was 0.54 (P less than .001) and the reproducibility of thermal sensory thresholds was 0.82 (P less than .001). In conclusion, patients with hemorrhoids have a mild anal sensory deficit, but continence in this group is likely to be augmented by other factors.\r"

Because clinical premonitory signs such as those seen in familial polyposis coli (FPC) are lacking, the clinician must recognize clinical findings and family history typical of HNPCC. The authors have described colorectal cancer expression from a survey of ten HNPCC kindreds. Kindred members with colorectal cancer differed significantly (P less than .05) from patients with sporadic colorectal cancer: 1) mean age of initial colon cancer diagnosis was 44.6 years; 2) 72.3 percent of first colon cancers were located in the right colon, and only 25 percent were in the sigmoid colon and rectum; 3) 18.1 percent had synchronous colon cancers; and 4) 24.2 percent developed metachronous colon cancer, with a risk for metachronous lesions in ten years of 40 percent. Affecteds and their first-degree relatives should undergo early intensive education and surveillance. In families with an early age of onset, colonoscopy should begin at age 25, and biannually thereafter, with fecal occult blood testing of the stool semiannually. Third-party carriers must become more responsive to the costly surveillance measures required for these otherwise healthy patients.\r"

The sphincter muscles, which were preserved by using the mucosal proctectomy technique, were used for conversion to a pelvic pouch five years later. The functional result was satisfactory and superior to that commonly seen in an average J-pouch patient. Patients with a continent ileostomy and in whom the rectum or sphincters have been preserved may be easily converted to a pelvic pouch, should they wish. Patients in whom a short mesentery prevents construction of a pelvic pouch, may be recommended a continent ileostomy as a temporary measure. Due to subsequent expansion of the reservoir, a restorative ileopouch-anal anastomosis may be possible at a later date. The good functional result in this case implies that the double folded reservoir according to Kock's original technique exhibits the same unique reservoir properties even when employed for an ileopouch-anal anastomosis.\r"

  ".W": "The present classification of first, second, and third grade hemorrhoids only reflects variation in size of a normal human tissue and does not relate to \"hemorrhoidal disease.\" Cross-sections and coronal sections of the anal canal in 32 fetuses, with ages ranging from 28 to 38 weeks of development, were studied and the following fundamental facts were found: in the lumen of the anal canals of fetuses, there are prominences of mucosa formed by conjunctive and muscular tissue, arterial and venous vessels and glands, arranged without following any particular pattern, which resemble similar formations found in the adult that protrude equally in the inside of the canal, known as hemorrhoids. The muscular tissue, smooth or striated, is grouped in bundles, and bunches of collagen fibers of homogeneous, nonfragmented, and regular aspect are found between them. Blood vessels have an ample lumen with a defined structure of collagen tissue as well as muscular tissue in its walls. Prominences of mucosa are connected to the remainder of the intestinal wall by defined conjunctive thick, nonfragmented fibers, that permit firm adherence. In healthy adults, the findings were similar but there was an evident degenerative process in the collagen fibers. In 100 surgical specimens of hemorrhoidectomies, the histologic investigation demonstrated a severe inflammatory reaction that especially affected the blood vessel wall and conjunctive tissue, which probably produced an ischemic lesion of the mucosa that could condition the onset of a vascular thrombosis, allowing displacement of the mucosa and its protrusion through the anus. The files of 815 patients suffering from hemorrhoidal disease were also studied. The main physical findings were bleeding, thrombosis of the internal hemorrhoidal plexus, prolapse of the anal cushions, or a combination of these. The authors propose to classify hemorrhoidal disease as bleeding, prolapsing, thrombotic, and mixed hemorrhoidal disease, aiming toward a rational treatment.\r"

Eight patients with idiopathic dyspepsia and nine postsurgical dyspeptic patients were studied and compared to a control group. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was determined after ingestion of a standardized meal using 99mTc-sulfur colloid scrambled eggs as the solid phase and [111In]DTPA-labeled water as the liquid phase. Following a basal study and on a separate occasion, each patient received an intravenous bolus of 10 mg of cisapride after ingestion of the test meal; 10 of the patients were restudied after a two-week period of chronic oral administration of the drug (10 mg four times a day). Baseline gastric emptying of solids was significantly delayed in idiopathic and postsurgical patients; liquid emptying was only delayed in the postsurgical group. Intravenous and oral administration of cisapride significantly shortened gastric emptying in both groups. In all but one patient, the clinical improvement was confirmed by the test. Cisapride appears to be a good alternative to metoclopramide and domperiodone in the treatment of dyspeptic patients. The dual radionuclide technique appears to be a useful physiologic tool for evaluating and predicting the efficacy of a gastric prokinetic therapy in man.\r"

Four gastrectomized dogs were equipped with extraluminal strain gauge transducers. Gastric emptying was measured radiographically. Four intact dogs were used as controls for emptying studies. Following gastrectomy, gastric emptying of both acaloric and nutrient meals was rapid in the initial period of the experiments. Gastric outflow was supported by propagating duodenal contractions. Compared with control dogs, the early emptying of nutrient meals was accelerated. In the following period, nutrients markedly slowed gastric emptying compared with acaloric meals due to a segmenting contractile pattern of the duodenum and a significant diminution of gastrointestinal motility. Results suggest that after Billroth-I gastrectomy (1) the control of gastric emptying by nutrients acts too late to slow the initial enhanced gastric outflow, and (2) the duodenal contractile patterns influence gastric emptying.\r"

G-cell count and gastrin content were determined in 10 parallel strips, which were cut by razor blades mounted on a handle. Gastric size and weight as well as thickness of mucosal and muscular layers and serum gastrin concentration were also determined. Body weight of the animals with pyloric stenosis was lower and gastric weight higher than that of the controls. Furthermore, we found an enlarged G-cell area and G-cell hyperplasia, an increased surface area and thickness of the mucosal and muscular layers of the stomach, and in the majority of rats, elevated serum gastrin levels. Total G-cell count was 583,720 +/- 90,561 in the rats with pyloric stenosis and 385,775 +/- 15,820 (mean +/- SEM) in the control rats (P less than 0.04).

Serum pepsinogen I concentrations also decreased significantly after vagotomy but to a significantly lesser extent than acid secretion. There was no correlation between serum pepsinogen I concentrations and peak acid secretion, either before or after vagotomy. Serum pepsinogen II concentrations decreased only slightly and transiently after vagotomy.

The purpose of this study is to determine if peptide YY affects pancreatic blood flow with simultaneous measurement of exocrine pancreatic secretion in dogs. Pancreatic blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter which allows continuous measurement of tissue blood flow. Natural peptide YY (0.1, 0.5, 1 microgram/kg) was infused intravenously as a bolus under background infusion of secretin (1 unit/kg/hr) in combination with cholecystokinin-octapeptide (0.1 microgram/kg/hr). Peptide YY caused a reduction of pancreatic blood flow in a dose-dependent manner as well as inhibition of pancreatic protein output, attaining the maximal reduction (28 +/- 4%) and inhibition (45 +/- 9%) at a dose of 1 microgram/kg, respectively. Simultaneous and continuous observation on tissue blood flow and exocrine secretion of the pancreas revealed that there was a highly significant correlation between the percent reduction of pancreatic blood flow and that of volume of pancreatic juice in response to peptide YY (r = 0.849, P less than 0.001). This study provides evidence that the mechanism of peptide YY-induced inhibition of exocrine pancreatic secretion is mediated, at least partly, through the decreased pancreatic blood flow.\r"

Sixteen cirrhotic patients with superimposed hepatocellular carcinoma in whom ascites was of uncertain etiology were considered separately. The mean ascitic fluid total protein, LDH, cholesterol, and fibronectin values in the peritoneal metastases group were 3.70 +/- 1.20 g/dl, 247.26 +/- 148.14 units/liter, 109.06 +/- 29.85 mg/dl, and 91.57 +/- 41.52 micrograms/ml, respectively, and all were significantly higher than the corresponding values in the liver disease group (P less than 0.001), which were 1.37 +/- 0.59 g/dl, 75.40 +/- 110.70 units/liter, 23.75 +/- 11.22 mg/dl, and 31.86 +/- 10.51 micrograms/ml, respectively. Mean serum-ascites albumin difference in the peritoneal metastases group was 0.62 +/- 0.38 g/dl, which was significantly different from the corresponding value in the liver disease group (1.92 +/- 0.41 g/dl, P less than 0.001). Both ascitic cholesterol above 46 mg/dl and an ascitic fibronectin concentration greater than 50 micrograms/ml had high diagnostic accuracy (97%) for malignancy, being higher than that achieved using a serum-ascites albumin difference under 1.1 g/dl and an ascitic total protein above 2.5 g/dl, which had accuracies of 94% and 93%, respectively. Ascitic fluid LDH was the least reliable test.

  ".W": "In this study we sought to define the role of oxygen-derived free radicals during ischemia and reperfusion in the production of acute damage to the gastric mucosa of baboons. The protective effect of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, the superoxide scavenger, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and a long-acting SOD-albumin was determined. Mucosal damage was evaluated using light and scanning electron microscopy. Evidence for oxidative insult to the gastric mucosa was sought by measuring tissue concentrations of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione. Gastric mucosal blood flow was estimated using the microsphere technique. A similar pattern of tissue damage was found at the end of ischemia in all three groups. Thirty minutes after reperfusion, severe mucosal damage (grade 3) increased only in the untreated control. In the two treated groups, grade 3 damage remained unchanged during reperfusion and a decrease in the percentage of moderate damage (grade 2) was seen. Both GSH and GSSG tissue concentrations were lower in the untreated controls as compared to the scavenger-treated groups, making it questionable whether GSH/GSSG tissue levels adequately reflect oxidative stress. We conclude that in our ischemia-reperfusion model the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals produces mucosal damage and prevents the restitution of moderate mucosal damage during reperfusion. In ischemia, factors other than free radicals seem to be responsible for mucosal damage. The protective effect of allopurinol and SOD was not mediated by changes in gastric mucosal blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of oxygen free radicals in the development of the ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage has been investigated. We found that oral administration of superoxide dismutase reduced the incidence of ethanol-induced mucosal lesions. Reduction of superoxide dismutase activity by diethyldithiocarbamate led to a pronounced aggravation of mucosal damage. Inhibition of the chloride-bicarbonate channel by a stilbene derivative also aggravated the ethanol-induced hemorrhagic lesions. Neither glutathione peroxidase, catalase, nor ceruloplasmin were capable of inhibiting the development of mucosal damage. Compounds with scavenging properties such as thiourea, 1-phenyl-3-(2-thiazolyl)-2-thiourea, dimethyl sulfoxide, various inorganic compounds (elements of the first and second subgroups and of the sixth group of the periodic table) and sulfhydryl-containing substances protected the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced injury in a dose-related manner. Naturally occurring antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, and coenzyme Q10 were ineffective. The present results suggest that superoxide free radicals are involved in the development of ethanol-induced gastric mucosal lesions, probably via an interaction with cellular membranes.\r"

The most rapid vascular change that occurred when the gastric mucosa was exposed to 100% ethanol was a severe segmental constriction of the large submucosal venules. At 22 sec, the average venular diameter was 52.2 +/- 6.0% of the original one. This was followed by complete superficial mucosal blood flow stasis at 49 +/- 4 sec and appearance of histologic evidence of necrosis in one of seven rats at 2.5 min, four of six rats at 10 min, and seven of seven rats at 60 min. We conclude that in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, submucosal venular constriction occurs first, followed by cessation of mucosal blood flow to be followed later on with histologic evidence of necrosis.\r"

We studied male Wistar rats (N = 10 each) 15 min, 2 hr, and 12 hr after hypovolemic shock and compared results to a control group (N = 15). Two rats in both 2-hr and 12-hr groups showed gastric ulcers: three corporal and one antral. One animal developed multiple ulcers. In the gastric corpus and antrum and in the duodenum, tissue SLI showed significant decrease 15 min and 2 hr after shock. Gastric SLI remained low, whereas duodenal SLI recovered and rose above control level at 12 hr. Pancreatic SLI showed no significant changes during hypovolemic shock. Gastric tissue SLI levels that were significantly lower after shock than those of normal controls may have contributed to the peptic ulcer disease induced by hypovolemic shock in this experimental model.\r"

An in vivo microscopy technique was used in the rat to determine whether this cessation of blood flow could be due to increased microvascular permeability with marked plasma exudation and a resultant increase in blood viscosity. The topical application of 100% ethanol to the mucosa caused complete stasis of mucosal blood flow within 1 min. Fluorescent in vivo microscopy revealed that topical ethanol also caused a prompt increase in mucosal microvascular permeability to albumin. This, however, did not explain the slowing and cessation of mucosal microvascular blood flow as these preceded the permeability change.\r"

In contrast, basal rates of duodenal alkaline secretion were significantly lower (2-3 mu eq/15 min) in pregnant rats (day 10 and 17) than those in nonpregnant rats (approximately 5 mu eq/15 min), although the duodenal mucosa responded to acid with a significant rise in HCO3- output in these three groups of rats. In pregnant rats (day 17), a single injection of digitoxin, a Na+ K+-ATPase inhibitor (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously), had no effect on basal acid and alkaline secretions, but significantly blocked the acid-induced HCO3- secretion for more than 18 hr from 6 hr after administration. This drug, when given once daily for four days (10 mg/kg, subcutaneously), produced well-defined ulcers in the proximal duodenum with few lesions in the stomach of female rats, and the severity and incidence were significantly higher in late-stage pregnant rats than in the other two groups of rats. Following repeated administration of digitoxin (10 mg/kg) to late-stage pregnant rats (days 17-20), acid secretion significantly declined after two days of treatment, while the acid-induced HCO3- secretion was significantly attenuated after one day of treatment and remained inhibited during the whole period. These results suggest that an impairment of the mechanisms related to acid-induced HCO3- secretion may be associated with the induction of duodenal ulcers caused by digitoxin in female rats, and the high incidence of these ulcers in late-stage pregnant rats may be due to acid hypersecretion.\r"

  ".W": "Many of the chronic complications of diabetes mellitus involve defects in the connective tissue such as poor wound healing, diminished bone formation, and decreased linear growth. Because collagen is the major protein component of these connective tissues, we examined collagen production in diabetic rats as a probe of this generalized defect in connective tissue metabolism. Doses of streptozocin ranging from 35 to 300 mg/kg were used to induce diabetes of graded metabolic severity in rats. Parietal bone or articular cartilage was removed and incubated at 37 degrees C with 5 microCi L-[5-3H]proline for 2 h, and collagen and noncollagen protein production were quantitated after separation with purified bacterial collagenase. Within 2 wk after induction of diabetes, collagen production was significantly reduced in bone and cartilage from diabetic rats to 52% (P less than .01) and 51% (P less than .01) of control (buffer-injected) levels, respectively. In contrast, noncollagen protein production in bone and cartilage from diabetic animals was no different from in tissue from control rats. The correlation between collagen relative to total protein production (relative rate) and the degree of hyperglycemia was highly significant for both bone (r = -.77, P less than .001) and cartilage (r = -.87, P less than .001). Other factors found to correlate with altered collagen production were the duration of diabetes and the amount of weight loss. Thus, diabetes is associated with a marked decrease in collagen production, which was seen early after induction of diabetes and was specific when compared with noncollagen protein production. Cumulative effects of these marked changes in collagen production may contribute to the chronic connective tissue complications in diabetes.\r"

The 1031 Rochester residents with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) were followed through their complete medical records in the community to 1 January 1982. The prevalence of persistent proteinuria was 8.2% at the diagnosis of NIDDM. Among those initially free of persistent proteinuria, the subsequent incidence was 15.3/1000 person-yr. Twenty years after the diagnosis of diabetes, the cumulative incidence of persistent proteinuria was 24.6%. A proportional hazards model identified the following risk factors for persistent proteinuria in NIDDM: elevated initial fasting blood glucose (P less than .01); older age at onset of diabetes (P less than .01); male gender (P = .05); and presence of macrovascular disease (P = .05), diabetic retinopathy (P = .05), or glycosuria (P = .07) at the diagnosis of diabetes. Separate analyses controlling for attained age indicated no association between duration of NIDDM and the incidence of persistent proteinuria. Stratified analysis of the two most significant risk factors (fasting blood glucose and age) indicated that hyperglycemia was a stronger risk factor for proteinuria in younger diabetic subjects, perhaps because of a competing risk of death in the elderly diabetic patient. In contrast to a recently described decreasing secular trend of proteinuria in Danish insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients, there was no decrease over the past 40 yr in proteinuria risk in this NIDDM incidence cohort.\r"

In darkness, pupillary unrest was 21% less in diabetic subjects than in controls. During prolonged and brief illumination, pupillary unrest was 35 and 37% less in diabetic subjects than in controls, respectively, and in both cases the unrest was inversely correlated to the duration of diabetes. There were inverse correlations between 1) vibratory perception threshold, long-term high blood glucose levels, and severity of retinopathy, and 2) pupillary unrest in darkness and during prolonged illumination. The fractional reduction in pupil size (relative miosis) was 19% less during prolonged illumination in diabetic subjects than in controls and was positively correlated to the pupillary unrest in both groups. For a given fractional reduction in pupil size during illumination, diabetic subjects still had a smaller unrest than controls. Pupil size in darkness was 19% smaller in diabetic subjects than in controls, and in diabetic subjects it was positively correlated to the unrest in darkness and during prolonged and brief illumination. None of the pupillary abnormalities showed correlation to biomicroscopic changes in the iris. The autonomic nervous system abnormalities reflected in the pupil in longstanding diabetes are 1) a reduction in pupillary unrest in light and in darkness, more pronounced in light, 2) a reduction in the ability to maintain miosis in continuous light, and 3) a reduction in size.\r"

Erythrocyte sorbitol and erythrocyte viscosity at high and low shear rates were studied in 20 insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) and 20 matched control subjects. An increased erythrocyte sorbitol and an increased low-shear erythrocyte viscosity were found in the IDDM patients, but there was no significant correlation (r = .11, NS) between the parameters. Incubation (3 h, 37 degrees C) in a Krebs buffer containing 33.3 mM glucose resulted in a significant sorbitol accumulation, but erythrocyte viscosity was not affected. Despite this fact, addition of 1 mM statil (ICI 128436) in the 5.5- and 33.3-mM glucose media not only prevented erythrocyte sorbitol accumulation but also improved erythrocyte viscosity in diabetic and control subjects. The effect was more pronounced at the low (approximately 16%) than at the high (approximately 2%) shear rate. The effect on erythrocyte viscosity disappeared by washing the erythrocytes after incubation, although erythrocyte sorbitol remained different. Our results suggest that sorbitol accumulation does not contribute to an increased erythrocyte viscosity in diabetes, and statil shows a positive effect on erythrocyte viscosity independent of its aldose reductase-inhibiting property.\r"

Physiol. 56: 308-314, 1984). To reexamine this phenomenon we measured postmortem airway function in anesthetized open-chest guinea pigs after sudden circulatory arrest. Animals were divided into 4 groups of 10 and ventilated for 15 min postmortem with different gases: 1) room air, 2) conditioned air, 3) dry 5% CO2-21% O2-74% N2, and 4) conditioned 5% CO2-21% O2-74% N2. In room air-ventilated lungs there was a 50% decrease in dynamic compliance (Cdyn) by 15 min and marked gas trapping compared with control lungs. Conditioning the room air did not attenuate these changes, but when 5% CO2 was added to the conditioned postmortem inspirate, gas trapping was eliminated and the fall in Cdyn was almost abolished. Ventilation with a dry 5% CO2 gas mixture at room temperature resulted in a 31% fall in Cdyn at 15 min but no gas trapping. We conclude that marked abnormalities of airway function occur postmortem in room air-ventilated guinea pig lungs in the absence of pulmonary blood loss. The changes are mainly due to airway hypocarbia, a known cause of bronchoconstriction, but a reduction in Cdyn can also occur if there is marked airway cooling and drying. Acute postmortem airway dysfunction can be prevented in the guinea pig by maintaining normal airway gas composition.\r"

Lung lymph was sampled at base line [left atrial pressure (LAP) 6.5 +/- 1.7 mmHg] and after two increases of LAP to 25.7 +/- 2.2 mmHg (level 1) and 37.0 +/- 5.1 mmHg (level 2). The lung lymph flow increased from 1.9 +/- 0.5 at base line to 9.3 +/- 2.2 and 15.9 +/- 0.7 ml/30 min, and the lymph-to-plasma concentration ratio of total protein decreased from 0.63 +/- 0.02 to 0.32 +/- 0.04 and 0.32 +/- 0.05 at the two elevated levels of LAP, respectively. The hyaluronan concentration in lung lymph was unchanged, and there was a flow-dependent elimination of hyaluronan from the lung that increased from 23 +/- 8 to 87 +/- 19 and 137 +/- 37 micrograms/30 min, respectively. The lung concentration of hyaluronan was 167 +/- 28 micrograms/g fresh lung, and at base line it was calculated that slightly less than 2% of the lung hyaluronan was eliminated by the lymphatic route in 24 h. If extrapolated to 24 h, the elimination rate of hyaluronan seen during elevated LAP would result in lymphatic elimination of 18% of the lung hyaluronan over this time period. Since hyaluronan is responsible for part of the protein exclusion in the extracellular matrix, it is plausible that washout of interstitial hyaluronan contributes to the decrease in albumin exclusion from the interstitium that occurs after an elevation of LAP.\r"

Additionally, the scavenger enzymes catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were examined to determine whether changes in LIPOX are associated with alterations in enzyme activity both at rest and after exercise. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 32) were randomly assigned to either trained or sedentary groups and were killed either at rest or after 20 min of treadmill running. The training program increased oxidative capacity 64% in leg muscle. After exercise, the sedentary group demonstrated increased LIPOX levels in liver and white skeletal muscle, whereas the endurance-trained group did not show increases in LIPOX after exercise. CAT activity was higher in both red and white muscle after exercise in the trained animals. Total SOD activity was unaffected by either acute or chronic exercise. These data suggest that endurance training can result in a reduction in LIPOX levels as indicated by MDA during moderate-intensity exercise. It is possible that activation of the enzyme catalase and the increase in respiratory capacity were contributory factors responsible for regulating LIPOX after training during exercise.\r"

We recorded simultaneously from the phrenic nerve, T10 internal intercostal nerve, and single bulbospinal expiratory neurons of the caudal ventral respiratory group (VRG). Laryngeal afferents were activated by electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) or by cold-water infusion into the larynx. Both types of stimuli caused inhibition of phrenic activity and facilitation of internal intercostal nerve activity, indicating expiratory effort. The activity of 46 bulbospinal expiratory cells was depressed during SLN electrical stimulation, and 13 of them were completely inhibited. In 44 of 56 neurons tested, mean firing frequency (FFmean) was decreased in response to cold-water infusion and 8 others responded with increased FFmean; in the remaining 4 neurons, FFmean was unchanged. Possible reasons for different neuronal responses to SLN electrical stimulation and water infusion are discussed. We conclude that bulbospinal expiratory neurons of VRG were not the source of the reflex motoneuronal expiratory-like activity produced by SLN stimulation. Other, not yet identified inputs to spinal expiratory motoneurons are activated during this experimental condition.\r"

To evaluate the influence of upper airway sensory feedback on pharyngeal muscle tone and thus pharyngeal patency, we measured pharyngeal airflow resistance and breathing pattern in 15 normal, supine subjects before and after topical lidocaine anesthesia of the pharynx and glottis. Studies were conducted during sleep and during quiet, relaxed wakefulness before sleep onset. Maximal flow-volume loops were also measured before and after anesthesia. During sleep, pharyngeal resistance at peak inspiratory flow increased by 63% after topical anesthesia (P less than 0.01). Resistance during expiration increased by 40% (P less than 0.01). Similar changes were observed during quiet wakefulness. However, upper airway anesthesia did not affect breathing pattern during sleep and did not alter awake flow-volume loops. These results indicate that pharyngeal patency during sleep is compromised when the upper airway is anesthetized and suggest that upper airway reflexes, which promote pharyngeal patency, exist in humans.\r"

The mean concentrations of plasma ionized calcium were not significantly different in asthmatics with and without EIA when measured either before treadmill exercise, during the last seconds of this exercise, or 10 or 20 min after exercise but were significantly lower than in another seven healthy subjects who undertook the same exercise protocol. Total plasma calcium concentrations in the three exercising groups were not significantly different at any point in time. The results suggest that in bronchial asthma an alteration of calcium metabolism may be important, but they also suggest that there is no simple relationship between the plasma ionized calcium concentration and acute exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.\r"

The three-dimensional equilibrium problems set by the tracheal deformation under various stresses have been solved using a convenient augmented Lagrangian functional. The dimensions were obtained from human tracheae. Mechanical constants for the anatomic components were calculated from the stress-strain relationships. The compressive narrowing is essentially due to the invagination of the posterior membrane in the tracheal lumen for transmural pressures down to -7 kPa. A surface of contact between the membranous wall and the lateral walls appears when the transmural pressure equals -6 kPa. The transmural pressure-area relationship is sigmoidal with a compliance equal to 0.08 kPa-1 for a transmural pressure of -2 kPa. The tracheal collapse is greater when the material constants of the membranous wall decrease or when the tracheal segment is subjected to a longitudinal tension. A slight flexion of the trachea induces an asymmetric deformation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cytochrome P-450 inducers on O2 toxicity were studied in mice. We first examined three cytochrome P-450 inducers, which differ by their specific tissue affinity: phenobarbital sodium (PB), essentially active in the liver, and 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and beta-naphthoflavone (BNF), which are also active in the lung. Both BNF and 3-MC increased the survival rate and significantly decreased pulmonary edema (pulmonary water and wet-to-dry weight ratio) in C57BL/6J mice exposed to hyperoxia (O2 greater than or equal to 95%), whereas PB had no protective effect. In the second part of this study, we compared the action of BNF in two strains of mice. In one (C57BL/6J), cytochrome P-450 can be induced by aromatic hydrocarbons, whereas in the other (DBA/2J) cytochrome P-450 is not inducible by these compounds. Protection against O2 toxicity was assessed in terms of lethality and pulmonary edema and of lung lipid peroxidation (assessed by measuring malondialdehyde). BNF only protected against O2 toxicity in the inducible strain. This protective effect of BNF on O2 toxicity in C57BL/6J mice was associated mainly with a large increase in the components of the cytochrome P-450 system (cytochrome P-450 and cytochrome b5) in the lung. The activity of pulmonary superoxide dismutase was also slightly increased, but the enhancement was not statistically significant. In contrast, in DBA/2J mice neither the components of the cytochrome P-450 system nor the activity of superoxide dismutase showed any increase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The aim of this study is to investigate changes in this metabolism during pubertal development. We compare blood lactate concentration ([L]) after maximal bicycle exercise in 20 boys acclimatized to high altitude (HA, 12 yr old) and at low altitude in 14 boys (LA1, 12 yr old) and in 13 boys (LA2, 14 yr old). The subjects had the same level of physical fitness and the same nutritional and socioeconomic status. Pubertal development was identified by salivary testosterone concentration ([T]). Results (means +/- SE) showed 1) at the age of 12 years, [L] and [T] in HA were significantly higher than in LA1 ([L] was 9.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, [T] was 233 +/- 66 vs. 132 +/- 30 pmol/l), 2) [L] and [T] in HA were statistically the same as in LA2, and 3) a linear relationship between [L] and [T] was significant (P less than 0.05) in all HA and LA subjects. This suggests that the higher [L] in 12-yr-old boys living at HA could result in an enhanced anaerobic metabolism linked to an earlier gonadal maturation evaluated by testosterone level.\r"

Compared with base line, a negative FD of RL appeared from 4 to 10 Hz in LL, B1, and B2 obstructions. The FD of XL greater than 20 Hz increased in MS and LL obstruction exclusively and was the ZL feature that most clearly differentiated central from peripheral obstruction. In this experimental model, the anatomic limit distal from which obstruction no longer causes the \"central\" type of ZL change lies in airways with internal diameters notably greater than 2 mm.\r"

Tidal volume, mean inspiratory mouth pressure, duty cycle, and hence the pressure-time product were kept constant, whereas work rate was varied by changing the frequency of breathing. There was a linear decrease in Tlim of -2.1 +/- 0.5 s.J-1.min-1 (r = 0.87 +/- 0.06) with increasing work rate. The data satisfied a model of energy balance during fatiguing runs (Monod and Scherrer. Ergonomics 8: 329-337, 1965) and were consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of energy supply, or respiratory muscle blood flow, is fixed when the pressure-time product is constant. Our results indicate that during inspiratory resistive breathing against fatiguing loads, work rate determines endurance independently of the pressure-time product. On the basis of the model, our results lead to estimates of respiratory muscle blood flow and available energy stores under the conditions of our experiment.\r"

Cats that were used were decerebrate, cerebellectomized, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated. Activities of the phrenic, facial, and mylohyoid nerves were monitored. Progressive caudal-to-rostral transections of the spinal cord and medulla were performed. Phrenic activity was eliminated by C1 spinal transections. Only modest changes in facial and mylohyoid activities resulted from transections as far rostral as the level of the dorsal respiratory nucleus. Rhythmic discharges ceased on transections at the pontomedullary junction. However, rhythmic mylohyoid discharges were maintained if protriptyline and strychnine were administered before and during the transection. In other studies rhythmic phrenic, facial, and mylohyoid discharges continued, albeit with an altered rhythm, after destruction of neurons in the dorsal respiratory nucleus by kainic acid. We conclude that caudal medullary mechanisms do not play an essential role in the neurogenesis of breathing movements. Rather, structures in rostral medulla and pons appear necessary for sustaining eupneic neural activities. The concept of multiple brain stem sites for ventilatory neurogenesis is discussed.\r"

Using nasopharyngeal catheters to instill small volumes of warm saline or water into the pharynx, we examined the incidence and characteristics of such a reflex in nine premature infants. Saline and water elicited the same pattern of responses, which frequently included swallows, central apnea, and airway obstruction and less commonly featured coughs, prolonged apnea, and arousal. With the exception of arousal, the incidence of these responses was significantly greater after delivery of water stimuli than after saline bolus administration. We therefore deduce chemoreceptor involvement in generation of these reflex responses and propose a laryngeal site for this sensory system, as in animals. Since greater potency of water compared with saline was demonstrable in all the infants studied, we further conclude that most preterm infants possess an upper airway chemoreflex.\r"

  ".W": "Contractile failure during various types of exercise has been attributed to intramuscular metabolic changes. We examined the temporal changes in force-generating capacity and metabolic state during intermittent isometric contractions in humans. One-legged quadriceps contractions at 30% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) were executed for 6 s, with 4 s of rest between. The decrease in force-generating capacity was tested from brief MVC's and short bursts of 50-Hz stimulation applied at 5-min intervals. After 1 min of exercise, the MVC force declined linearly and in parallel to the 50-Hz stimulation force, indicating that the contractile failure was due to intramuscular processes. After 30 min of exercise the MVC force had declined by approximately 40% compared with the value obtained after 1 min. In separate experiments the same contraction protocol was followed, but two-legged contractions were used. Muscle biopsies taken after 5, 15, and 30 min of exercise showed only minor changes in the concentrations of glycogen, lactate, creatine phosphate (CrP), and ATP. However, at exhaustion, defined as loss of ability to sustain the target force, the concentrations of CrP and glycogen were reduced by 73 and 32%, and muscle lactate concentration had increased to 4.8 mmol/kg wet wt. Thus the gradual decline in force-generating capacity was not due to lactacidosis or lack of substrates for ATP resynthesis and must have resulted from excitation/contraction coupling failure, whereas exhaustion was closely related to phosphagen depletion, without significant lactacidosis.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the effects of epinephrine (EPI) infusion on muscle glycogenolysis and force production, the quadriceps muscles of both legs in six subjects were intermittently stimulated for 30 min. Contractions lasted 1.6 s (20 Hz) and were separated by 1.6 s of rest. EPI was infused (approximately 0.14 micrograms.kg body wt-1.min-1) in one leg during the last 15 min and the vastus lateralis was biopsied at rest (control leg only) and after 15, 18 (EPI leg only), and 30 min of stimulation. EPI infusion doubled the mole fraction of phosphorylase a (22.5 +/- 4.1 to 44.8 +/- 9.0%) and glycogenolysis (2.16 +/- 0.72 to 5.45 +/- 0.81 mmol glucosyl U.kg dry muscle wt-1.min-1) during stimulation. Muscle glucose 6-phosphate increased from 3.04 +/- 0.17 to 6.43 +/- 0.20 mmol/kg dry muscle wt, and lactate increased from 25.8 +/- 4.4 to 34.3 +/- 4.6 mmol/kg after 3 min of EPI infusion. Isometric force production was unaltered by EPI infusion. These results demonstrate a strong glycogenolytic effect of EPI infusion during prolonged electrical stimulation and suggest that the extra pyruvate formed was converted mainly to lactate. Exclusive anaerobic metabolism of the extra substrate would provide only a 10% increase in total ATP production, possibly accounting for the lack of improvement in force production. We suggest that the decrease in force production during prolonged electrical stimulation is related to decreased excitation of the contractile mechanism rather than inhibition of cross-bridge turnover caused by a shortage of energy or accumulation of hyproducts.\r"

  ".W": "During sustained hypoxia the decline in ventilation that occurs in normal adult humans may be related to central accumulation of a neurochemical with net inhibitory effect. Recent investigations have shown that the putative neurotransmitter adenosine can effect a prolonged respiratory inhibition. Therefore we evaluated the possible role of adenosine in the hypoxia ventilatory decline by employing aminophylline as an adenosine blocker. We evaluated the ventilatory response to 25 min of sustained hypoxia (80% arterial O2 saturation), in eight young adults after pretreatment with either intravenous saline or aminophylline. With a mean serum aminophylline level of 15.7 mg/l, over 25 min of sustained hypoxia, peak hypoxic ventilation decreased by only 12.8% compared with 24.8% with saline, a significant difference. However, the ventilatory decline during sustained hypoxia was not abolished by the aminophylline pretreatment. Unlike the usual tidal volume-dependent attenuation of hypoxic ventilation exhibited after saline, after aminophylline the ventilatory decline was achieved predominantly through alterations in respiratory timing. Thus aminophylline pretreatment did alleviate the hypoxic ventilatory decline, although the associated alterations in breathing pattern were uncharacteristic. We conclude that adenosine may play a contributing role in the hypoxic ventilatory decline.\r"

Compared with the awake state, mean BBF increased by 4.7% during NREM and by 32.6% during REM (P less than 0.001). Also, surges of BBF during REM occurred during periods of intense phasic activity. EMGdi [peak and peak/inspiratory time (TI)] was highly variable within REM periods but fluctuated as a reciprocal function of simultaneously measured BBf (r = -0.49, P less than 0.001). Furthermore, mean EMGdipeak decreased from NREM to REM in a manner reciprocally related to the corresponding change in BBF (r = -0.77, P = 0.015). These findings suggest that a component of the reduction of respiratory neuromotor output during REM is attributable to increased BBF with consequent relative hypocapnia in the central chemoreceptor environment.\r"

The present study was designed to assess the effects of swim conditioning on another form of systolic overload, subdiaphragmatic suprarenal aortic stenosis. Cardiac mechanics in an isolated working heart apparatus and myosin enzymology were studied in four groups of rats: controls (C), animals with chronic systolic overload secondary to aortic constriction (St), swim-conditioning animals (Sw), and animals exposed to a combined load (St-Sw). Heart weight was increased by 23% in St, 27% in Sw, and 36% in St-Sw. In contrast to HTN, cardiac pump and muscle function were not depressed in St. Sw was associated with improved cardiac output, stroke work, and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. St-Sw showed improved mechanical cardiac performance relative to both C and St. The percent of ventricular myosin of the V1 type and Ca2+-activated myosin ATPase activity relative to C was unchanged in Sw but was depressed in St and St-Sw. These data demonstrate that the salutory mechanical effects of Sw can be superimposed on the systolic overload of St. However, the dissociation between mechanics and myosin enzymology suggests that factors in excitation-contraction coupling other than myosin isoenzyme shifts are responsible for this finding.\r"

  ".W": "Maximal exercise has been performed by eight men and eight women, using four types of ergometer (2-leg, 1-leg, arm + shoulder, and arm) while breathing room air and while breathing 12% O2. Results have been related to anthropometric estimates of muscle mass in the active limbs. Although significant sex differences of O2 transfer and power output are shown, the sex-specific aerobic performance was roughly proportional to active muscle volume (both when comparing individuals on a given type of ergometer and when comparing average scores of the several types of ergometer). However, the relationship was closer for steady power output than for peak O2 intake (where the scores for arm work were boosted by the use of accessory muscles and by hyperventilation). When breathing 12% O2, the 2-leg performance was substantially reduced (an average of 28.7% for O2 transport and 19.2% for power output). This effect dropped to 9.1% for O2 transport and 12% for power output in one-leg ergometry and was negligible for arm or arm plus shoulder work. It is argued that because of difficulty in perfusing small muscles, arm work is limited largely by the intrinsic power of the active muscles, that single-leg ergometry is limited rather equally by central circulatory and muscular factors, and that two-leg ergometry is almost entirely dependent on the central circulatory transport of O2.\r"

Thirteen healthy male volunteers were divided into two groups according to their level of fitness: 1) trained endurance athletes (T) (n = 7), with a VO2max range of 56-75 ml.kg-1.min-1 and 2) untrained individuals (UT) (n = 6), with a VO2max range of 33-49 ml.kg-1.min-1. Subjects performed two incremental cycle ergometry tests to determine VO2max under hypoxic conditions [14% O2-86% N2, barometric pressure (PB) = 760 Torr] and normoxic conditions (21% O2-79% N2, PB = 760 Torr). Tests were single blind, randomly administered, and separated by at least 72 h. Mean percent oxyhemoglobin saturation (%SaO2) during maximal exercise under hypoxic conditions was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in the T group (77%) compared with the UT group (86%). Furthermore, the T group exhibited larger decrements (P less than 0.05) in VO2max (normoxic-hypoxic) compared with the UT group. Finally, a significant linear correlation (r = 0.94) existed between normoxic VO2max (ml.kg-1.min-1) and delta VO2max (normoxic-hypoxic). These data suggest that highly T endurance athletes suffer more severe gas exchange impairments during acute exposure to hypoxia than UT individuals, and this may explain a portion of the observed variance in delta VO2max among individuals during acute altitude or hypoxia exposure.\r"

This study evaluated the effects of NITP with and without airway obstruction confined to early (ED), mid- (MD), or late diastole (LD) on the subsequent LVSV, anteroposterior (AP), and right-to-left (RL) aortic diameters (DAO) (series I, n = 6) as well as on phasic arterial blood flow out of the thorax (series II, n = 6) in anesthetized dogs. Transient NITP was obtained by electrocardiogram-triggered phrenic nerve stimulation. In series I, NITP applied for 60% of diastole with the airway obstructed caused decreases of LVSV during ED [-7.7 +/- 3.2% (SE) NS], MD (-11.7 +/- 3.9%, P less than 0.05), and LD (-14.6 +/- 1.5%, P less than 0.01) associated with significant increases of left ventricular end-diastolic pressures relative to both atmospheric and esophageal pressures during MD and LD. NITP increased DAO(AP) and DAO(RL), resulting in increases in diastolic aortic cross-sectional area by an average of 6.1-8.3% (P less than 0.01). Similar changes were seen with the airway unobstructed during NITP. In series II, NITP caused diminished diastolic antegrade carotid artery and/or descending aortic flow run off in all dogs. Transient retrograde arterial flows with NITP were observed in more than half of the animals consistent with increases in aortic diameters. We conclude that a decrease of intrathoracic pressure confined to diastole can 1) diminish the ensuing LVSV, presumptively reducing preload by ventricular interdependence; 2) distend the intrathoracic aorta; 3) diminish antegrade flow out of the thorax independent of effects on cardiac performance; and 4) cause transient retrograde carotid and aortic blood flow. The intrathoracic aorta and, presumably, the arterial intrathoracic vascular compartment can be viewed as an elastic container driven by changes in intrathoracic pressure.\r"

An increase in LV afterload produced by NITP has been proposed as one explanation but is difficult to evaluate if preload is also altered. To test the hypothesis that a systolic event alone, i.e., a change in LV afterload or contractility, can reduce LVSV during inspiration independent of changes in LV preload, a rapid transient NITP confined to systole was produced by electrocardiogram-triggered phrenic nerve stimulation in eight anesthetized dogs. Intrathoracic descending aortic diameters were measured by sonomicrometry to transduce qualitative changes in aortic transmural pressure. With the airway completely obstructed systolic NITP resulted in a decrease in LVSV (-8.1%, P less than 0.001) but an increase in the systolic anteroposterior (0.54 mm, P less than 0.01) and right-to-left (0.45 mm, P less than 0.01) aortic diameters compared with preceding beat. Similar significant changes were observed with the airway unobstructed. These observations are consistent with an increased afterload imposed on the LV reducing LVSV and egress of blood out of the thorax. Prolonging NITP to include both systole and diastole, a profound fall in LVSV is observed, consistent with the independent influences of systolic and diastolic events combining to diminish LVSV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects consisted of 40 normals (N), 15 asymptomatic smokers (S), 10 smokers with small airway disease (SAD), 20 with chronic simple bronchitis (SB), and 15 with chronic obstructive bronchitis (COPD), and a relationship of total aerosol deposition to degree of lung abnormality was investigated. The subjects were categorized by medical history and a battery of pulmonary function tests, including spirometry, body plethysmography, and single and multiple N2 washout measurements. Subjects repeatedly breathed a monodisperse test aerosol (1.0 micron diam) from a collapsible rebreathing bag (0.5 liter volume) at a rate of 30 breaths/min, while inhaled and exhaled aerosol concentrations were continuously monitored by a laser aerosol photometer in situ and recorded on a strip-chart recorder. The number of rebreathing breaths resulting in 90% aerosol loss from the bag (N90) was determined, and percent predicted N90 values were then determined from the results of computer simulation and used as a deposition index. The percent predicted N90 values were 99.7 +/- 14, 86.5 +/- 15, 66.9 +/- 17, 51 +/- 12, and 30.9 +/- 9, respectively, for N, S, SAD, SB, and COPD. All of these values were significantly different from each other (P less than 0.05). There was no difference between male and female but percent predicted N90 values were slightly higher in young than in old normals. Percent predicted N90 values showed a strong linear correlation with spirometric measurements of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and maximum midexpiratory flow rate. However, many of the SAD and SB with normal spirometry showed abnormal N90. These results suggest that total lung aerosol deposition is a sensitive index of lung abnormality and may be of potential use for nonspecific general patient screening.\r"

The isobaric active volume change (delta V) or isovolumetric active pressure change (delta P) generated by submaximal histamine was measured at four different transmural pressures (Ptm's) reached by balloon inflation. The maximal delta P = 11.2 +/- 0.6 cmH2O (mean +/- SE) was achieved at 30.8 +/- 1.2 cmH2O Ptm and maximal delta V = 0.20 +/- 0.02 ml at 16.7 +/- 1.7 cmH2O Ptm. The P-V relationships were similar when volume was increased after either isobaric or isovolumetric contraction. The calculated length-tension (L-T) relationship showed that the active tension curve was relatively flat and that the passive tension at the optimal length was 149 +/- 11% of maximal active tension. These data show that 1) a large elastic component operates in parallel with the smooth muscle in intralobar pulmonary arteries, and 2) the change in resistance associated with vascular expansion of the proximal arteries is independent of the type of contraction that occurs in the more distal arterial segments.\r"

During occluded breaths in the intact animal, the parasternal intercostal was electrically active and shortened while pleural pressure fell. In contrast, after section of the third intercostal nerve at the chondrocostal junction and abolition of parasternal electrical activity, the muscle always lengthened. This inspiratory muscle lengthening must be related to the fall in pleural pressure; it was, however, approximately 50% less than the amount of muscle lengthening produced, for the same fall in pleural pressure, by isolated stimulation of the phrenic nerves. These results indicate that 1) the parasternal inspiratory shortening that occurs during occluded breaths in the dog results primarily from the muscle inspiratory contraction per se, and 2) other muscles of the rib cage, however, contribute to this parasternal shortening by acting on the ribs or the sternum. The present studies also demonstrate the important fact that the parasternal inspiratory contraction in the dog is really agonistic in nature.\r"

Physiol. 51: 465-476, 1981), we estimated the mean diameter (D) of the pulmonary air spaces in subjects diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 8) and in subjects with normal pulmonary function (n = 10). For each subject, RC (aerosol expired/aerosol inspired) decreased exponentially with t. Based on a model of the lung as a system of randomly oriented cylindrical tubes, the half time (t1/2) (i.e., the breath-hold time to reach 50% of RC with no breath hold) is proportional to a mean diameter (D) of air spaces filled with aerosol. Subjects with normal pulmonary function had a mean t1/2 = 6.5 +/- 0.8 s, corresponding to a mean D = 0.36 +/- 0.05 mm. On the other hand, subjects with COPD had a mean t1/2 = 12.7 +/- 3.2 s, corresponding to a mean D = 0.70 +/- 0.18 mm [i.e., twice as large (P less than 0.01) as normal subjects]. Furthermore, D correlated significantly with diffusing capacity in the patients with COPD (r = -0.95, P less than 0.001 for D vs. percent predicted diffusing capacity of CO) but not with any other measure of pulmonary function. In contrast, D varied only slightly in normals and did not correlate with any measure of pulmonary function. We conclude that in vivo measures of RC vs. t, in conjunction with other pulmonary function tests, may be a useful tool for identifying actual changes in pulmonary air-space sizes associated with pulmonary disease.\r"

With this information we can now estimate regional interstitial volume in the field of the external probe (VIs). Dividing the mass of EV tracer by VIs, we obtain interstitial concentration ([Is]). Directly sampling plasma concentration of the tracer, we can construct plasma-interstitium equilibration curves that are analogous to plasma-lymph equilibration curves without invasive surgery. We completed 46 ERD studies in 21 sheep with chronic lung lymph fistulas. Sheep were studied under baseline conditions (n = 30) and after elevating left atrial pressure by mitral obstruction (n = 7), or intravascular volume infusion (n = 8), and increasing lung vascular permeability (n = 1). In each study we compared the slope of the regression through plasma-lymph concentration of tracer protein over time ([P]-[L], measured directly) with that through values of plasma-interstitial concentration ([P]-[Is], assessed noninvasively), an index of vascular permeability. For this correlation, r = 0.94, and the regression line approximates identity. Mean [Is] appears to approximate [L] in sheep.\r"

We measured esophageal temperature (Tes), mean skin temperature, and arm sweating continuously and forearm blood flow (FBF) as an index of skin blood flow, twice each minute by venous occlusion plethysmography. During steady-state exercise, Tes was unchanged by sleep loss. The sensitivity of FBF to Tes was depressed an average of 30% (P less than 0.05) after 33 h of wakefulness with a slight decrease (-0.15 degrees C, P less than 0.05) in the core temperature threshold for vasodilatory onset. Sleep loss did not alter the Tes at which the onset of sweating occurred; however, sensitivity of arm sweating to Tes tended to be lower but was not significant. Arm skin temperature was not different between control and sleep loss experiments. Reflex cutaneous vasodilation during exercise appeared to be reduced by both central and local factors after 33 h of wakefulness.\r"

From these data, pre- and postcapillary resistances and pre- and postcapillary resistance ratios were determined. Vascular and tissue oncotic pressures were estimated from plasma and lymph protein concentrations, respectively. By use of the collected and calculated data, tissue pressure in the digit was calculated using the Starling equation. In the isolated equine digit, isogravimetric capillary pressure averaged 36.7 mmHg, plasma and lymph oncotic pressures averaged aged 19.12 and 6.6 mmHg, respectively, interstitial fluid pressure averaged 25.6 mmHg, and the capillary filtration coefficient averaged 0.0013 ml.min-1.mm-1.100 g-1. Our results indicate that digital capillary pressure in the laterally recumbent horse is much higher than in analogous tissues in other species such as dog and human. However, the potential edemagenic effects of this high digital capillary pressure are opposed by at least two mechanisms: 1) a high tissue pressure and 2) a low microvascular surface area for fluid exchange and/or a low microvascular permeability to filtered fluid.\r"

  ".W": "It has been proposed that an increase in the affinity of hemoglobin for O2 may be beneficial in severe hypoxemia. To test this hypothesis, we compared the response to progressive hypoxemia in dogs with normal hemoglobin affinity (P50 = 32.4 +/- 0.7 Torr) to dogs with a left shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (P50 = 21.9 +/- 0.5 Torr) induced by chronic oral administration of sodium cyanate. Animals were anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. The inspired O2 fraction was progressively lowered by increasing the inspired fraction of N2. The lowest level of O2 transport required to maintain base-line O2 consumption (VO2) was 9.3 +/- 0.8 ml.min-1.kg-1 for control and 16.5 +/- 1.1 ml.min-1.kg-1 for the sodium cyanate-treated dogs (P less than 0.01). Other measured parameters at this level of O2 transport were, for experimental vs. control: arterial PO2 19.3 +/- 2.4 (SE) Torr vs. 21.8 +/- 1.6 Torr (NS); arterial O2 content 10.0 +/- 1.2 ml/dl vs. 4.9 +/- 0.4 ml/dl (P less than 0.01); mixed venous PO2 14.0 +/- 1.5 Torr vs. 13.8 +/- 1.0 Torr (NS); mixed venous O2 content 6.8 +/- 1.0 ml/dl vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2 ml/dl (P less than 0.01); and O2 extraction ratio 32.7 +/- 2.8% vs. 51.2 +/- 3.8% (P less than 0.01). We conclude that chronic administration of sodium cyanate appears to be detrimental to O2 transport, since the experimental dogs were unable to increase their O2 extraction ratios to the same level as control, thus requiring a higher level of O2 transport to maintain their base-line VO2 values.\r"

Theoretically pulsed pressures may be safer and more effective than static pressures for reexpanding alveoli. We compared the increases in lung volume and arterial PO2 (PaO2) induced by 30-s increases in mean airway pressure in six New Zealand White rabbits made atelectasis prone by saline lavage plus 1 h of conventional ventilation. Pulsatile SI's (HFO-A left on during increase in mean pressure) of delta PSI = 5, 10, and 15 cmH2O and static SI's (HFO-A off during SI) of delta PSI = 5, 10, 15, and 20 cmH2O were delivered in random order. Lungs were ventilated at 15 Hz, inspired fractional concentration of O2 = 1.0, and mean airway pressure 15-20 cmH2O between test periods and deflated to functional residual capacity before each SI to standardize volume history. With both maneuvers, increases in lung volume and PaO2 induced by SI's were proportional to the magnitude of the SI (P less than 0.001) in all cases. Pulsatile SI's consistently increased lung volume and PaO2 more than static SI's having the same delta PSI (P less than 0.005) such that any given target PaO2 or change in volume (delta V) was achieved at 5 cmH2O less mean pressure with the pulsatile maneuver. Respiratory system compliance increased after both types of SI. Oxygenation and lung volume changes at 5 min were related with r = 0.58 (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have recently demonstrated that bronchoconstriction induced by an aqueous extract of cotton bracts (CBE) is associated with bronchoalveolar complement activation, release of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) chemoattractants by pulmonary cells, and increased numbers of bronchoalveolar lavage PMN's. In the present study we performed bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on subjects after CBE or control (saline) challenge and examined whether BAL cells were activated in vitro to produce other inflammatory agonists. After CBE administration, cultured BAL cells released increased amounts of the reactive O2 species, superoxide (O2-.), and the cyclooxygenase products prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane B2. Although none of these in vitro parameters of BAL cell activation appeared to correlate with the degree of bronchoconstriction induced by CBE, BAL fluid levels of thromboxane B2 were also increased after CBE administration and in vivo amounts of this eicasanoid did correlate with the degree of bronchoconstriction induced by CBE (r = 0.50, P less than 0.04). Finally, although cell culture supernatants were highly chemotactic for PMN's, concentrations of leukotriene B4 were not increased, suggesting other chemotaxins were released by BAL cells in this setting. We conclude that CBE administration activates bronchoalveolar cells to release reactive O2 species and cyclooxygenase products that may be important in the bronchoconstricting response to CBE.\r"

Five subjects were studied for 4.5 min at a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min and a duty cycle of 0.5. Studies were performed at rest without added respiratory loads and at elevated inspiratory work loads with the use of an inspiratory valve that permitted flow only when a threshold pressure was maintained. Cardiac output and O2 consumption were calculated using a rebreathing technique. Respiratory muscle blood flow and O2 consumption were estimated as the difference between resting and loaded breathing. Work of breathing was calculated by integrating the product of mouth pressure and volume. Increases in cardiac output and O2 consumption in response of 4.5 min loaded breathing averaged 1.84 l/min and 108 ml/min, respectively. No increases were seen in response to 20-s loaded breathing. In a separate series of experiments on four subjects, though, cardiac output increased for the first 2 min then leveled off. These results indicate that the increase in cardiac output was a metabolic effect of the increased work load and was not caused primarily by the influence of the highly negative intrathoracic pressure on venous return. Efficiency of the respiratory muscles during inspiratory threshold loading averaged 5.9%, which was similar to measurements of efficiency of respiratory muscles using whole-body O2 consumption that have been reported previously in humans and in dogs.\r"

We used the micropuncture technique to measure alveolar liquid pressure at several transpulmonary pressures on lung deflation. Alveolar liquid pressure was greater than pleural pressure but less than airway pressure at all transpulmonary pressures. Alveolar liquid pressure decreased further below airway pressure with lung inflation. At high transpulmonary pressure, alveolar liquid pressure was less in newborn than in adult lungs. To study the effects of edema, we measured alveolar liquid pressures in newborn lungs with different wet-to-dry weight ratios. Alveolar liquid pressure increased with progressive edema. In addition, we compared alveolar liquid and perivenular interstitial pressures in perfused newborn lungs and found that they were similar. Thus alveolar liquid pressure can be used to estimate perivenular interstitial pressure. We conclude that the transvascular pressure gradient for fluid flux into the interstitium might increase with lung inflation and decrease with progressive edema. Furthermore, this gradient might be greater in newborn than adult lungs at high inflation pressures.\r"

Hematocrit (38.1-44.9%) and hemoglobin concentration (12.7-14.7 g.dl-1) increased from control to postreinfusion. At peak exercise, VO2max decreased from T1-N (2.40 l.min-1) to T1-H (2.15 l.min-1) then increased at T3-H (2.37 l.min-1). Maximal arterial-mixed venous O2 difference decreased from T1-N to T1-H and increased at T3-H. Cardiac output (Q), stroke volume, heart rate, and total peripheral resistance during maximal exercise were unchanged from T1-N through T3-H.

When compared with submaximal values for T1-N, VO2 was unchanged at T1-H and T3-H; Q increased at T1-H and decreased at T3-H; arterial-mixed venous O2 difference decreased at T1-H and increased at T3-H; Hb flow did not change at T1-N but increased at T3-H. For young women, simulated altitude erythrocythemia increased peak Hb flow and decreased physiological altitude (227.8 m) but did not affect maximum cardiac output (Qmax).\r"

Physiol. 62: 2013-2025, 1987), we recently predicted that 1) axially arranged choke points can exist simultaneously during forced expiration with sufficient effort, and 2) overall maximal expiratory flow may be relatively insensitive to nonuniform airways obstruction because of flow interdependence between parallel upstream branches. We tested these hypotheses in excised central airways obtained from five canine lungs. Steady expiratory flow was induced by supplying constant upstream pressure (Pupstream = 0-16 cmH2O) to the bronchi of both lungs while lowering pressure at the tracheal airway opening (16 to -140 cmH2O). Intra-airway pressure profiles obtained during steady maximal expiratory flow disclosed a single choke point in the midtrachea when Pupstream was high (2-16 cmH2O). However, when Pupstream was low (0 cmH2O), two choke sites were evident: the tracheal site persisted, but another upstream choke point (main carina or both main bronchi) was added. Flow interdependence was studied by comparing maximal expiratory flow through each lung before and after introduction of a unilateral external resistance upstream of the bronchi of one lung. When this unilateral resistance was added, ipsilateral flow always fell, but changes in flow through the contralateral lung depended on the site of the most upstream choke. When a single choke existed in the trachea, addition of the external resistance increased contralateral flow by 38 +/- 28% (SD, P less than 0.003). In contrast, when the most upstream choke existed at the main carina or in the bronchi, addition of the external resistance had no effect on contralateral maximal expiratory flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Young lungs typically show small collagen fibers that radiate from the \"posts,\" whereas larger fiber bundles traverse the septum irrespective of capillary blood vessels.

Subjects inspired maximally while their lungs were inflated at a constant rate during each breath for 10 min. Inspiratory and expiratory time, flow rate, tidal volume, and end-tidal CO2 were maintained constant. In each subject, maximum inspiratory mouth pressure exponentially decayed over the first few minutes to an apparent sustainable value. Repeated tests in experienced subjects showed high reproducibility of sustainable pressure measurements. To determine the effects of flow, endurance tests were repeated in four subjects at flows of 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25 l/s, with a constant duty cycle. As flow increased, the maximum pressures that could be attained at rest and the maximum sustainable pressures decreased. At each flow, the sustainable pressure remained a constant fraction of the maximum pressure attainable at rest. We interpret the decay in mouth pressure during isoflow endurance tests to directly reflect the loss of net inspiratory muscle force available by maximum voluntary activation of the inspiratory pump.\r"

In 25 decerebrate paralyzed cats the frequency of the high spectral peak was 92.3 +/- 11.1 Hz before and 105.3 +/- 12.1 Hz during the step in inflation pressure, shifting upward by 13.0 +/- 6.0 Hz. For 8 of the 25 cats, the recurrent laryngeal and phrenic neurograms were recorded simultaneously. The high spectral peak was present during inspiration in the recurrent laryngeal power spectra and coherent with the high peak in the phrenic power spectra. In response to lung inflation, the high peak disappeared from the power spectra of the recurrent laryngeal nerve as the inspiratory activity was inhibited; a shift upward in frequency was not detectable. Comparing inspiratory times (TI, based on the phrenic neurograms) for breaths with no lung inflations to those for breaths with lung inflations, I found that lung inflations early in inspiration caused a decrease in TI, lung inflations at intermediates times had no effect on TI, and lung inflations late in inspiration caused an increase in TI. Despite lung inflation decreasing, not affecting, or increasing inspiratory duration and amplitude of the phrenic neurogram, lung inflation always caused a shift upward in the high-frequency peak of the phrenic power density. The fact that lung inflation, a powerful respiratory stimulus, affected the frequency of the high peak in a consistent manner suggests that the high-frequency synchrony is an important and robust feature of the central respiratory pattern generator.\r"

It is shown that the conventional inert gas elimination equation takes the form of a convolution integral, and the relationship between VA/Q distribution and inert gas elimination resembles that of a noncausal low-pass filter with infinite zero-frequency gain. With the use of this formulation, characteristic features of VA/Q distribution may be represented in the frequency domain in terms of the corresponding energy spectrum. It is shown that the lack of resolution associated with finite data samples and measurement error is caused by distortions in the high-frequency contents of the resulting VA/Q distribution. With six inert gases, the technique cannot resolve a log SD less than 0.21 decade and a modal separation less than 0.87 decade. In the presence of measurement error, the degree of resolution is even less. It is suggested that for maximum resolution the number of discrete and duplicate data samples should be chosen so that the resulting noise and sampling cutoff frequencies are approximately equal.\r"

The mass of weights on the lever rose by 85% over the 36-wk period (P less than 0.05) The estimated force that the plantar flexors had to develop to lift the lever rose by 32% (P less than 0.05), just as the work per lift rose by 28% (P less than 0.05). For the trained group of rats the soleus muscles of the right and the left limb were 34% (P less than 0.05) and 31% (P less than 0.05) heavier, respectively, after the training period than those of the control group. Similarly, the plantaris muscles of both the right and the left limb were 24% heavier (P less than 0.05). For the trained group the maximum twitch and tetanus tensions of the soleus were 63% (P less than 0.05) and 65% (P less than 0.05) higher, respectively. Relative to the plantaris these measures were 79% (P less than 0.05) and 37% (P less than 0.05), respectively. The described model, therefore, seems appropriate for the study of the skeletal muscles' adaptation to usage.\r"

In this analysis, we evaluated the accuracy of equations proposed by Pilati and Maron [Am. J. Physiol. 247 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 16): H1-H7, 1984] and Wolf et al. [Am. J. Physiol. 253 (Heart Circ. Physiol. 22): H194-H204, 1987] to calculate sigma from these concentration changes. We calculated sigma with each equation using data generated from a mathematical model of fluid and solute flux in membranes with known sigma's. We found that the equation of Wolf et al. provided the closest approximation to the true sigma over the entire range of filtration fractions tested (0.1-0.6), with the differences between the two equations increasing with filtration fraction. At low filtration fractions, the difference in sigma obtained using either approach was found to be inconsequential. At larger filtration fractions, a closer approximation of the true sigma can be obtained using the equation of Wolf et al.\r"

  ".U": "88243662\r", 
  ".W": "Inasmuch as it has been claimed that inductance plethysmography can measure cross-sectional area changes, we tested this assumption. We present experimental and computed relationships between self-inductance (L) of coils and areas (A) included inside for a coil with a well-defined side wavy pattern (triangular or sinusoidal) and for a real belt (Respitrace) placed on elliptical or rectangular configurations. The results are applied to the physiological field using measurements obtained from a computed tomography experiment. We demonstrate that the L-A relationships vary not only with shape or ellipticity of the cross section but also with the wavy pattern shape. This last parameter is critical because it is difficult to actually control. When the coil wavy pattern remains steady, there are some physiological situations where inductance plethysmography can more accurately estimate area changes: when the configuration shape is constant, the correspondence between delta L and delta A is almost linear with a shape-dependent sensitivity; when the configuration is nearly circular (ellipticity in the range 0.8-1), the relative error in delta A estimation is less than 5%.\r"

Dissecting aneurysms and post-traumatic pseudoaneurysms, although of different aetiology and morbid anatomy, are also included since the surgical technique adopted is similar in all groups. Clinically different aspects of acute and chronic lesions are analyzed. Of all preoperative examinations, angiography is preferred as it gives the most precise definition of the aortic lesion. This is especially necessary in the case of acute dissection or rupture of thoracic aorta although the role of CAT scan is becoming progressively more important. In cases of aortic dissection with massive aortic valve insufficiency, the substitution of the ascending aorta and aortic valve with reimplantation of coronary arteries, in accordance with Bentall's technique is also indicated. The improvement in surgical results is emphasized, since surgical mortality has decreased from 30.6% to 22% in the last eight years. This is due to improvement in surgical technique, to extra corporeal circulation and myocardial protection.\r"

A segment of infrarenal aorta was resected and reanastomosed in rabbits. In the control group, rabbits were fed commercial chow (ORC 4). In the cholesterol group, rabbits were fed a diet of 1% cholesterol added to ORC 4. In the Elastase group, rabbits were fed the same diet as the cholesterol group but received intraabdominal injections of Elastase. The rabbits were kept for 4 months and the abdominal aorta was retrieved for examination. All anastomosed aortas were patent. The cholesterol group developed aneurysmal dilatation in one and stenosis of the anastomosed sites due to hypergranulation in the remaining rabbits. Neither aneurysmal nor stenotic changes were detected in the other groups. We concluded that the administration of Elastase suppressed cholesterol induced atherosclerotic changes at the anastomotic sites in these animals.\r"

Nineteen surgeons performing CEA were classified into four groups: general surgeons (GS), general vascular surgeons (GVS), cardiovascular surgeons (CVS), and neurosurgeons (NS). The stroke and combined stroke and death rates respectively by the four groups were 6.1% and 6.1%; 3.2% and 3.5%; 6.5% and 8.7%; and 6.5% and 6.5%. The indications of CEA varied among the groups. Asymptomatic stenosis constituted 10.6%, 16.0%, 19.0%, and 0% of the total CEA performed by the groups respectively; nonhemispheric transient ischemic attacks (TIA) constituted 3.0%, 18.4%, 8.7%, and 0%; hemispheric TIA constituted 77.3%, 58.1%, 63.0% and 90.3%; and stroke constituted 9.1%, 7.5%, 8.7% and 9.7%. When CEA for asymptomatic stenosis and nonhemispheric TIA were combined, the stroke rate was 22.2% for the GS group; 1.6% for the GVS group; and 15.4% for the CVS group. In conclusion, the overall stroke rate was close for the four groups at 6.1%, 3.2%, 6.5% and 6.5% respectively. However, asymptomatic and nonhemispheric TIA patients had significantly lower complication rates when operated on by the GVS group in contrast to the other groups (1.6% for the GVS in contrast to 22.2% for the GS and 15.4% for the CVS). The GVS and CVS groups operated more frequently on asymptomatic and nonhemispheric TIA patients than the GS and NS groups.\r"

Resting plasma fibrinolytic activity and fibrinolytic potential after ten minutes of venous occlusion were compared in 100 patients with peripheral vascular disease of varying severity and 20 age-sex matched controls. The fibrinolytic assay used was the euglobulin lysis time. Resting plasma fibrinolytic activity was significantly reduced in patients with a recent arterial thrombosis (p = 0.02) and ischaemic rest pain (p = 0.008) compared with controls. Fibrinolytic potential after venous occlusion was significantly reduced also in patients with a recent arterial thrombosis (p = 0.02) and ischaemic rest pain (p = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no significant differences between patients with claudication and controls. A reduced plasma fibrinolytic activity has been confirmed in patients with peripheral vascular disease and fibrinolytic potential may be a superior method of assessment as the euglobulin lysis time after venous occlusion is independent of the fibrinogen concentration. It remains uncertain whether the finding of reduced plasma fibrinolytic activity in patients with peripheral vascular disease is cause or effect and whether the finding has prognostic significance.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effects of omega-3 fish oil (FO) supplementation on lipid metabolism, glycemic control, and blood pressure (BP) in patients with type II diabetes mellitus. In 22 diabetic patients without overt hyperlipidemia, serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, HDL2-cholesterol, HDL3-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) levels did not change during omega-3 FO supplementation for 8 weeks. The mean serum apo B concentration increased significantly [baseline, 2.56 +/- 0.11 (+/- SEM) mmol/L; 4 weeks, 2.82 +/- 0.13 mmol/L; 8 weeks, 2.80 +/- 0.13 mmol/L; P less than 0.01]. The mean plasma postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity increased transiently during the fourth week (baseline, 168 +/- 17 U/mL; 4 weeks, 182 +/- 18 U/mL; P less than 0.05), whereas postheparin hepatic triglyceride lipase activity did not change. Glycemic control worsened transiently during the fourth week, (baseline, 7.7 +/- 0.4%; 4 weeks, 8.4 +/- 0.3%; P less than 0.05). Both systolic and diastolic BP decreased significantly throughout the study (systolic BP: baseline, 142 +/- 5 mm Hg; 8 weeks, 128 +/- 5 mm Hg; diastolic BP: baseline, 88 +/- 4 mm Hg; 8 weeks, 80 +/- 3 mm Hg; P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that in type II diabetics without overt hyperlipidemia, omega-3 FO supplementation does not improve either the glycemic control or serum lipids, and it is associated with a potentially detrimental rise in serum apo B concentrations. Until more information is available, use of such supplementation should be discouraged.\r"

We studied the relative contributions of genetic and nongenetic factors on the production rate (PR) and MCR of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and their conversion ratios to other metabolites in monozygotic (MZ; n = 22) and dizygotic (DZ; n = 24) male twins. Zygosity was determined by measurement of 10 blood proteins and enzymes. The kinetic studies were conducted with isotope dilution techniques. The genetic effect was determined from the equation: 2[rMZ - rDZ], where r is intraclass correlation. A heritability of over 40% was found for the PRs of DHT/body surface area and of testosterone/body surface area. Nongenetic factors accounted for 50% or more of the variation of the conversion ratios for testosterone/3 alpha-androstanediol and DHT/3 alpha-androstanediol. The results suggest that genetic factors markedly influence the PRs of testosterone and DHT, suggesting that the PR of these potent androgens is under genetic control despite the decided influence of environmental factors on their clearance.\r"

  ".W": "We postulated that significant quantities of both protein-bound and unbound adrenocorticoids are lost during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To test this hypothesis we measured the dialysate removal rates (DRR) of adrenocorticoids in six CAPD patients. The distribution of the adrenocorticoids among unbound, albumin-bound, and transcortin-bound fractions in dialysate effluent was determined. The distribution of cortisol among unbound, albumin-bound, and transcortin-bound fractions in plasma was determined in six other CAPD patients. The mean DRR of cortisol was 193.8 +/- 20.3 (+/- SE) nmol/day. Smaller quantities of 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, aldosterone, 18-hydroxy-11-deoxycorticosterone, and 18-hydroxycorticosterone were removed during CAPD. The mean DRR values for total protein, albumin, and transcortin were 11.2 +/- 2.1, 6.0 +/- 2.2, and 0.087 +/- 0.018 g/day, respectively. The distribution of cortisol among unbound, albumin-bound, and transcortin-bound fractions was normal in plasma from CAPD patients. Plasma transcortin had a normal affinity (2 x 10(7) mol/L-1) and a normal binding capacity (559 nmol/L) for cortisol. In contrast, dialysate transcortin had a low affinity (1.4 x 10(7) mol/L-1) for cortisol and a low cortisol-binding capacity (11.5 nmol/L). The fractional occupancy rates of high affinity cortisol-binding sites on transcortin were 52.0 +/- 3.3% and 3.3 +/- 0.6% in plasma and dialysate effluent, respectively (P less than 0.001). The transcortin to cortisol molar concentration ratio in dialysate (6.3 +/- 0.6) was significantly higher than that in plasma (1.6 +/- 0.2; P less than 0.001). These results demonstrate that cortisol is the major adrenocorticoid lost during CAPD. However, the amount of cortisol removed in the dialysate is less than 1% of the normal daily secretion rate. Significant quantities of other adrenocorticoids are also lost during CAPD. The adrenocorticoids present in dialysate effluent are principally unbound, in contrast to their state in plasma. However, small fractions of the respective steroids are bound to transcortin and albumin.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the circadian, ultradian, and pulsatile nature of PRL release in the human, we sampled blood at 10-min intervals for 24 h in each of 12 normal young men. The subsequent serum PRL time series were subjected to contemporary techniques of rhythmic and episodic peak detection. Fourier analysis revealed a significant circadian rhythm in serum PRL concentrations in all 12 men. The mean circadian amplitude was 2.1 +/- 0.3 ng/mL (micrograms/L), which accounted for an average of 30 +/- 4% of the 24-h mean PRL concentration. In addition, multiple ultradian PRL rhythms were found with periodicities ranging from 22-242 min. Spectral analysis disclosed ultradian cycles with periodicities of 30-32, 51-59, 90-98, and 234 min. Assessment of episodic PRL pulsatility by Cluster analysis revealed 14 +/- 1 PRL peaks/24 h (P less than 0.01 vs. signal-free noise), which occurred at an interpulse interval of 95 +/- 6 min. The average duration of a serum PRL peak was 67 +/- 5 min, and its incremental amplitude was 4.0 +/- 0.3 ng/ml (micrograms/L), which represented a 58 +/- 6% increase above the preceding nadir. Discrete PRL peaks were separated by nonpulsatile valleys, with a mean duration of 27 +/- 1 min. Analysis of the temporal coupling between LH and PRL release by bivariate autoregressive modeling in six men revealed significant cross-correlations between LH and simultaneous PRL concentrations as well as between LH and PRL concentrations that lagged LH by 10 or 20 min. Cross-spectral analysis demonstrated significantly correlated PRL and LH cycles with periodicities of 33-37, 47-52, and 84-106 min. In summary, PRL release in normal young men is characterized by significant circadian and ultradian periodicities, by discrete episodic pulsations that occur approximately every 95 min, and by a close temporal coupling with LH (temporal lag between LH and PRL of 0-20 min).\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether hyperprolactinemic women with menses are at risk for the development of osteopenia and to define the effects of PRL excess and estrogen deficiency on bone mass in amenorrheic women, spinal and radial bone densities were measured in 25 hyperprolactinemic women (13 with amenorrhea and 12 with regular menstrual periods) and 11 women with hypothalamic amenorrhea. The degree of hyperprolactinemia was comparable in the hyperprolactinemic women with and without menstrual periods [mean, 55 +/- 18 (+/- SD) and 57 +/- 16 micrograms/L, respectively]. The mean spinal bone density in the hyperprolactinemic amenorrheic women (148 +/- 26 mg/K2HPO4.cm3) was significantly lower (P less than 0.01) than that in 19 normal women (178 +/- 21 mg/K2HPO4.cm3), and 6 of the former group had values greater than 2 SD below normal. However, the mean spinal bone density in the eumenorrheic hyperprolactinemic women (171 +/- 22 mg/K2HPO4.cm3) was similar to that in the normal women and was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that in the hyperprolactinemic amenorrheic women. The mean spinal bone density in the women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (128 +/- 24 mg/K2HPO4.cm3) and normal PRL levels was also significantly (P less than 0.001) lower than that in normal women or hyperprolactinemic euenorrheic women. Six of the women with hypothalamic amenorrhea had bone density measurements greater than 2 SD below normal. The spinal bone density values were similar in the amenorrheic women with or without hyperprolactinemia. The mean radial bone density in the hyperprolactinemic women with amenorrhea (0.69 +/- 0.03 g/cm2) was comparable to that in the women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (0.69 +/- 0.05 g/cm2), and both groups had significantly (P less than 0.05) lower values than normal women (0.72 +/- 0.03 g/cm2). Radial bone density was normal in the hyperprolactinemic eumenorrheic women. The mean serum estradiol level in the hyperprolactinemic amenorrheic women (120 +/- 90 pmol/L) was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than that in the hyperprolactinemic eumenorrheic women measured during the follicular phase of their cycles (240 +/- 180 pmol/L) and was comparable to that in the women with hypothalamic amenorrhea (80 +/- 40 pmol/L). Multiple comparisons of clinical variables, serum hormone concentrations, and bone mass demonstrated a significant correlation (P = 0.0125) between bone density and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, which suggests a role for endogenous androgens in the maintenance of premenopausal bone mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The mean basal diastolic BP was slightly higher in the adrenalectomized women (80 vs. 68 mm Hg; P less than 0.05). During mental arithmetic, the adrenalectomized women had a smaller heart rate increase than the normal women [6 +/- 1% (+/- SE) vs. 16 +/- 4%; P less than 0.05], but the BP response was not different. During the head-up tilt and cold pressor tests the hemodynamic responses were similar in the adrenalectomized and normal women. As expected, plasma E was undetectable in the adrenalectomized women. Plasma norepinephrine (NE) did not change in either group during mental arithmetic. In the adrenalectomized women the plasma NE increases during the head-up tilt and cold pressor test were not significantly different from those in the normal women. Thus, the adrenalectomized women had a normal pressor response during all 3 types of adrenergic stimulation, apparently independent of plasma E. Together with the normal plasma NE responses to head-up tilt and cold exposure, we challenge the contention that the E-mediated presynaptic beta-adrenergic stimulation of NE release plays a pivotal physiological role during short term adrenergic stress.\r"

The 3 antisera were similar to each other in their reactivity with thyroid Tg samples from 25 patients with various thyroid disorders and from 10 normal subjects. However, the immunoreactivity of the 35 individual Tg samples varied considerably. Decreased reactivity was associated with proteolysis during Tg preparation, iodination in vitro with 20 or more atoms of iodine/molecule Tg, the 27S species of Tg, Tg from 3 patients with thyroid cancer, and Tg from several patients with Graves' disease. The antiserum to Graves' Tg contained some antibodies that did not bind normal Tg on an affinity column, and these antibodies reacted more with Tg from patients with Graves' disease than with Tg from normal subjects or patients with nontoxic goiters. Thus, Tg from patients with Graves' disease may contain antigenic sites that are not present or exposed in Tgs from other subjects. We conclude that thyroid Tgs from patients with Graves' disease and from those with thyroid cancer may be different in structure from the Tgs of normal subjects. This conclusion is important to an understanding of Tg structure in thyroid disease and to the use of thyroid Tg for preparation of antisera and standards for measuring serum Tg concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Liver is an important site for the peripheral production of T3 by outer ring deiodination (ORD) of T4 as well as for the clearance of plasma rT3, which is produced by inner ring deiodination (IRD) of T4 in other tissues. However, little is known about the underlying enzymatic reactions, and current concepts about thyroid hormone deiodination are largely based on studies in rat tissue. Here we describe the results of detailed studies of the catalytic properties of the iodothyronine deiodinase activity of human liver. The results demonstrated a high degree of similarity with the type I deiodinase of rat liver. The enzyme activity was found in the microsomal fraction. rT3 was the preferred substrate, since its ORD was catalyzed roughly 400 times more efficiently than the ORD or IRD of T4 or the IRD of T3. The deiodination of sulfated substrates was more rapid, as demonstrated by the roughly 30-fold increase in the IRD of T3 sulfate (T3S) compared with T3. The deiodinations exhibited ping-pong-type kinetics with dithiothreitol as the cofactor. Inhibition by propylthiouracil was uncompetitive with substrate and competitive with dithiothreitol, and PTU was an equally effective inhibitor of the ORD of rT3 and the IRD of T3S (Ki, 0.10-0.16 mumol/L). Various compounds with widely different inhibitory potencies had similar effects on ORD (rT3) and IRD (T3S). These results suggest that in human liver microsomes a single enzyme catalyzes the deiodination of the outer as well as the inner ring of iodothyronines by the same catalytic mechanism and with the same substrate specificity as the type I deiodinase of rat liver.\r"

Thus little is known about its pharmacokinetics. The 2-fold purpose of this study was 1) to develop a practical method for quantitating DHT2 after oral dosing in normal subjects, and 2) to assess changes in serum DHT2 levels and calcium and phosphorus metabolism after DHT2 administration for 8 days. Peak serum DHT2 levels in six normal subjects, assayed by high performance liquid chromatography were achieved 4 h after administration of 0.4-0.8 mg DHT2; at 24 h, levels had declined by 70% whether DHT2 had been given for 1 or 8 days. These data indicate that a standard approach is needed to interpret the results of serum DHT2 measurements in treated patients. Interfering substances were detected in lipemic serum. The major biological effects of DHT2 administration were hypercalciuria in two subjects and a fall in serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D[1,25-(OH)2D] levels, including free levels when measured, in all subjects. Possible explanations for this fall in serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels include decreased 1,25-(OH)2D production because of competition for the 1 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme by a metabolite(s) of DHT or increased metabolic clearance of 1,25-(OH)2D.\r"

These differences in risk may be due to alternations in plasma lipoproteins modulated by hormonal changes. Plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I and B (apoB) concentrations, as well as low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle size (LDL 1-7), as assessed by 2-16% polyacrylamide-agarose gradient gel electrophoresis, were determined in 87 premenopausal and 43 postmenopausal women. All were participants in the Framingham Offspring Study, were gynecologically normal, and were not taking any hormones. The postmenopausal women had significantly (P less than 0.05) higher plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations than did the premenopausal women. Plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoB levels were higher, and apoA-I and high density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower in the postmenopausal group, but these differences were not significant at P less than 0.05. The postmenopausal women were likely to have small LDL particles compared to premenopausal women. Controlling for age and body mass index effects significantly reduced the differences in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apoB, and LDL particle size and broadened the differences in apoA-I and high density lipoprotein cholesterol. These data indicate that menopause is positively correlated with LDL cholesterol (P less than 0.05) and decreased LDL particle size (P less than 0.05) after adjusting for significant covariates.\r"

Histological examination of the patients' thyroid glands revealed amyloid deposition and no evidence of subacute thyroiditis. In addition, 1 man had low T3 thyrotoxicosis with an elevated rT3/T3 ratio, suggesting impaired peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, and immunological and histological evidence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These findings suggest that thyroid amyloidosis may be associated with STLS.

  ".W": "Although more than 50 patients with the tumor-induced osteomalacia syndrome, characterized by remission of unexplained osteomalacia after resection of a coexisting tumor, have been reported, the pathogenesis of this syndrome is still not clear. We investigated the cause of biopsy-confirmed osteomalacia which was resistant to treatment with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 in a 54-yr-old man. He had severe hypophosphatemia, a high serum alkaline phosphatase level, a low plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, and remarkably increased urinary phosphorus excretion. A tumor, with histological characteristics of a hemangiopericytoma, was found on his left thigh. After surgical removal of this tumor, his plasma 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and serum phosphorus levels increased to normal levels, and his bone pain subsided. The tumor was transplanted to athymic nude mice. A nodule formed in each mouse, with histological features identical to those of the original tumor, and the tumor-bearing mice had hypophosphatemia, high serum alkaline phosphatase levels, and increased urinary phosphorus excretion. When extracts of the original tumor were added to primary cultures of renal tubular cells, renal cAMP levels did not change, but 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity was significantly inhibited. These data indicate tumoral production of some humoral factor(s) inhibiting 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity and phosphorus reabsorption unrelated to adenylate cyclase-cAMP production in proximal renal tubules.\r"

  ".W": "We found in a previous study that injections of GH for 3 weeks caused nitrogen conservation despite restriction of intake to 24 Cal (100 kJ)/kg ideal BW (IBW). To determine the effects of longer periods of treatment and further caloric restriction on nitrogen balance, lipolysis, and body composition, 20 obese (30-67% over IBW) subjects (16 women and 4 men; 20-54 yr old) were fed a diet of 18 Cal (75 kJ)/kg IBW with 1.2 g protein/kg IBW daily for 13 weeks. During weeks 2-12, 10 subjects received injections of recombinant methionyl GH (0.1 mg/kg IBW every other day), and the other 10 sex-, age-, and weight-matched subjects were given injections of saline. There were no significant differences between the two groups in total weight loss [GH, 13.9 +/- 3.0 (+/- SD) kg; saline, 15.2 +/- 3.8 kg ) or the percentage of body fat lost (GH, 8.1 +/- 2.4%; saline, 7.5 +/- 1.5%), although GH injection caused a significant acute increment in serum FFA concentrations (GH, 0.53 +/- 0.37 mmol/L; saline, 0.08 +/- 0.22 mmol/L; P less than 0.001) throughout the study. This acute lipolytic response to GH decreased significantly, from 0.86 +/- 0.32 mmol/L on day 1 of GH treatment to 0.35 +/- 0.41 mmol/L by day 35 of GH injection (P less than 0.01). Nitrogen balance was significantly more positive in the group receiving GH during the first 33 days of the GH injection period [GH, +0.07 +/- 1.82 g/day (+5.0 +/- 130.0 mmol/day); saline, -1.91 +/- 1.10 g/day (-136.3 +/- 78.5 mmol/day); P less than 0.001]. During the last 44 days of GH injection, however, the nitrogen balance in the two groups was similar [GH, -0.90 +/- 1.65 g/day (-64.2 +/- 117.8 mmol/day); saline, -1.08 +/- 0.95 g/day (-77.1 +/- 67.8 mmol/day); P = NS]. Mean plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations rose from a basal value of 1.6 +/- 0.8 to 2.9 +/- 1.2 U/mL by 48 h after the first GH injection and ranged subsequently from 3.2 +/- 1.3 to 4.9 +/- 3.3 U/mL during GH injection (P less than 0.001). In contrast, the mean IGF-I concentration did not change in the group that received saline. Dietary restriction during the first week of study caused serum T3 concentrations to decline in both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Gel filtration on Sepharose CL-6B demonstrated iodothyronine binding to all lipoprotein classes. In the total lipoprotein fraction (density less than 1.210 g/mL), high density lipoproteins (HDL) were the major binders, accounting for 92% of lipoprotein-bound T4, 99% of lipoprotein-bound T3, and 55% of lipoprotein-bound rT3. The estimated iodothyronine binding in normal plasma to HDL, low density lipoproteins (LDL), and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) was 3%, 0.2%, and 0.03% for T4, 6%, 0.05%, and 0.02% for T3, and 0.1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% for rT3, respectively. These estimates may be low owing to possible dissociation during chromatography and the short incubation period used to avoid changes in lipoprotein structure. In VLDL and LDL deficiency (abetalipoproteinemia), HDL deficiency (Tangier disease), LDL excess (type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia), and VLDL excess (type III, IV, and V hyperlipoproteinemia), the distribution of iodothyronines reflected the lipoprotein abnormality. Variations resulting from altered distribution within HDL subclasses were also found. Binding was saturable, with approximate dissociation constants for VLDL, LDL, and HDL of 10(-5)-10(-6) mol/L. We conclude that thyroid hormones bind specifically to apolipoproteins, although additional binding by solubilization in the lipid components of the lipoproteins may also occur.\r"

In this study, we tested the thyrotropic activity of purified and commercial hCG and compared its action with that of bovine TSH (bTSH) in cultured rat FRTL-5 cells in regard to stimulation of iodide uptake, activation of adenylate cyclase, and synthesis of DNA. Iodide uptake was measured after incubation of the cells for 48-72 h with the test hormones, followed by a 40-min incubation with 0.1 microCi Na125I and 10 mumol/L carrier NaI; the 125I in the washed cells was counted. Adenylate cyclase was measured after incubation of the cells with the test stimulators for 3 h in hypotonic medium by RIA of cAMP in the medium. DNA synthesis was measured after incubation of the cells with the test substances for 24 h, followed by addition of [3H]thymidine for 3 h and then measuring the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the cells. Both purified and commercial hCG produced a dose-related increase in iodide uptake. The relative potency of commercial hCG was 0.024 microU bTSH/U hCG and that of purified hCG was 0.042 microU bTSH/U hCG; compared with human TSH, the potency of purified hCG was 0.72 microU/U hCG. hCG caused a dose-related increment of adenylate cyclase and [3H]thymidine incorporation. The effect of hCG on iodide uptake and [3H]thymidine incorporation was additive with that of bTSH; hCG was not an antagonist of TSH in these cultured rat thyroid cells. We conclude that hCG has intrinsic thyrotropic activity in FRTL-5 cells in regard to stimulation of iodide uptake, activation of adenylate cyclase, and stimulation of DNA synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "The inherited metabolic disorder tumoral calcinosis is characterized by elevated serum phosphorus and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] levels and paraarticular calcific tumors. The pathogenesis of this disease is obscure, but an elevated renal phosphate reabsorption threshold and increased production of 1,25-(OH)2D are postulated as defects. We studied nine affected patients and found that both serum phosphorus and renal phosphate reabsorption threshold (TmP/GFR) were positively correlated with serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels. Since tumoral calcinosis is a disorder with abnormal renal phosphate transport, we compared the TmP/GFR and serum 1,25-(OH)2D levels to values obtained in patients with two other diseases with renal phosphate transport defects: oncogenic osteomalacia and X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. We found a significant correlation between TmP/GFR and 1,25-(OH)2D levels in all three diseases, suggesting that in these diseases 1,25-(OH)2D production is regulated in some manner by phosphate transport. Furthermore, previous work indicated that in tumoral calcinosis broad variation exists in serum phosphorus levels. In our patients a negative correlation was found between the serum PTH concentrations and both serum phosphorus levels and TmP/GFR values, respectively. We postulate that although the basic defect in tumoral calcinosis most likely resides in the proximal renal tubular cell, the variation in serum phosphorus levels and possibly disease expression is modulated in part by PTH.\r"

Sex steroid influx into these tissues was studied after in vivo arterial bolus injections of [3H]testosterone or [3H]estradiol in anesthetized rats. Both testosterone and estradiol were readily cleared across the BTB or prostate cell membrane in the absence of plasma proteins and in the presence of human pregnancy serum, in which testosterone or estradiol are 80-95% distributed to TeBG. The extravascular extraction of [3H]TeBG across the BTB or prostate plasma membrane [73 +/- 2% (+/- SE) and 92 +/- 9%, respectively] was significantly greater than extraction of [3H]albumin or other plasma space markers and indicative of a rapid first pass clearance of TeBG by Sertoli or prostate cells. In summary, these studies indicate that 1) testosterone and estradiol are readily cleared by Sertoli and prostate cells; 2) albumin- and TeBG-bound sex steroids represent the major circulating pool of bioavailable hormone for testis or prostate; and 3) the TeBG-sex steroid complex may be nearly completely available for influx through the BTB or prostate plasma membrane.\r"

  ".W": "This study tested the hypothesis that the absolute dimension of a coronary stenotic lesion is a more important determinant of its hemodynamic effect on regional myocardial perfusion during exercise than is relative percent stenosis. In 31 patients with an isolated lesion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, regional myocardial perfusion was determined from thallium-201 scans recorded in the left anterior oblique projection after symptom-limited treadmill exercise. Thallium-201 uptake in the distribution of the left anterior descending coronary artery was expressed as a ratio of thallium-201 uptake in the left circumflex artery distribution. Percent area stenosis, minimal cross-sectional area and mean diameter of each stenotic lesion were measured by computer-assisted cinevideodensitometric analysis of projected coronary arteriograms digitized in a 512 X 512 pixel matrix with 256 gray levels. Thallium-201 uptake in the left anterior descending coronary artery distribution, expressed as a ratio, correlated poorly (r = 0.65) with relative percent stenosis, but correlated significantly (r = 0.83; p less than 0.05) with absolute lesion area. For all 16 patients with reduced regional perfusion in the left anterior descending coronary artery distribution during exercise, lesion cross-sectional area was less than 1.8 mm2 (mean 0.9 +/- 0.6); for 13 of the 15 patients with normal distal perfusion, the area of the stenotic lesion was greater than 1.8 mm2 (mean 2.7 +/- 0.7; p less than 0.001). Percent coronary stenosis failed to predict flow-limiting lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

No patient had chest pain or electrocardiographic changes during exercise testing. The mean age of patients was 32 years. All patients had a normal ejection fraction. Six (29%) of the 21 diabetic patients had evidence of diastolic dysfunction as assessed by the presence of at least two abnormal variables of mitral inflow velocity. The ratio of peak early to peak late (atrial) filling velocity was significantly decreased in diabetic compared with control subjects (1.24 +/- 0.21 versus 1.66 +/- 0.30, p. less than 0.001). Atrial filling velocity was significantly increased in diabetic patients (74.3 +/- 16.7 versus 60.3 +/- 12.2 cm/s, p less than 0.004), whereas early filling velocity was reduced by a nearly significant degree (88.8 +/- 12.6 versus 98.5 +/- 18.8 cm/s, p less than 0.057). The atrial contribution to stroke volume as assessed by area under the late diastolic filling envelope compared to total diastolic area was also significantly increased in diabetic compared with control subjects (35 versus 27%, p less than 0.001). Left ventricular diastolic filling abnormalities in diabetic patients did not correlate with duration of diabetes, retinopathy, nephropathy or peripheral neuropathy. These data suggest that approximately one-third of such patients have subclinical myocardial dysfunction unrelated to accelerated atherosclerosis. Doppler echocardiography may offer a reliable noninvasive means to assess diastolic function and to follow up diabetic patients serially for any deterioration in cardiac status before the appearance of clinical symptoms.\r"

In 314 patients with sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, 801 drug studies were performed using a standard protocol of programmed electrical stimulation. The criteria for proarrhythmia were: 1) initiation of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in a patient in whom only nonsustained tachycardia was induced at baseline; 2) conversion of a sustained tachycardia that could be terminated by programmed electrical stimulation at baseline to one that required cardioversion for termination during drug therapy; 3) initiation of a sustained tachyarrhythmia by a less aggressive mode of stimulation than was required at baseline; and 4) development of spontaneous or incessant ventricular tachycardia. Proarrhythmia criterion 1 occurred during 20 (18%) of 118 studies and at least once in 15 (28%) of 54 patients. Criterion 2 was met during 39 (7%) of 578 studies and at least once in 29 (13%) of 220 patients. Criterion 3 was achieved during 135 (20%) of 687 studies in patients with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias at baseline. Criterion 4 occurred during 9 (1%) of 801 drug studies. In 40 patients in whom well tolerated ventricular tachycardia was initiated with fewer extrastimuli during drug study than at baseline, the drug was continued and the patients were followed up. The recurrence rate of tachycardia was the same in these patients as in 73 patients followed up on regimens on which the number of extrastimuli required for initiation was not reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To test whether increased difficulty in inducing ventricular tachycardia during antiarrhythmic therapy can be considered a sufficient criterion for predicting long-term efficacy of such therapy in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias, 95 patients were studied with a graded stimulation protocol (single and double premature stimuli during sinus rhythm and ventricular drives of 120, 140, 160 and 180 beats/min). After a control study, the effects of oral antiarrhythmic drugs on the ability to induce ventricular tachycardia were assessed. The median number of drug trials was four per patient. After antiarrhythmic therapy, four subgroups of patients were identified. In 36 patients, there was no change in inducibility (group 1), whereas in 18 patients ventricular tachycardia was rendered more difficult to induce; that is, a sustained ventricular tachycardia was inducible at a basic drive at least 40 beats/min faster than during the control study (group 2). In 34 patients, ventricular tachycardia induction was suppressed (group 3) and in 7 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, only 3 to 5 repetitive ventricular responses were induced after treatment (group 4). During follow-up of 15.5 +/- 11.5 months, 10 patients of group 1 had a recurrence of ventricular tachycardia and 6 died suddenly, whereas in group 2 only 1 patient died suddenly and in group 3, 2 patients had a recurrence of ventricular tachycardia (group 1 versus 2 and 3, p less than 0.001, Mantel-Cox and Breslow; group 2 versus 3, no difference). Thus, increased difficulty in inducing ventricular tachycardia is a sufficient criterion for predicting long-term efficacy of an antiarrhythmic drug regimen.\r"

Therefore, the same orthogonal ECGs were analyzed in the frequency domain (Blackman-Harris window) and the time domain after signal averaging and high gain, low noise amplification (0 to 300 Hz) in 30 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia after myocardial infarction, 15 patients without ventricular tachycardia after infarction and 15 healthy subjects. Patients with bundle branch block were not excluded. Twenty-one of the 30 patients with ventricular tachycardia had late potentials in the time domain and abnormal Fourier transform of the ST segment (defined as increased spectral area of 60 to 120 Hz and spectral peaks greater than 10 dB). Among the remaining nine patients with ventricular tachycardia all had no late potentials in the time domain and one manifested abnormal frequency spectra. In contrast, of the 15 patients without ventricular tachycardia after infarction, 2 had late potentials in the time domain and only 1 demonstrated abnormal frequency spectra; none of the healthy subjects manifested either phenomenon. Patients with bundle branch block were correctly classified by Fourier analysis, but were frequently missed by time domain analysis. Normalization of the spectra and area ratio proved potential pitfalls, and the choice of an appropriate ST segment was crucial: if the segment was long with respect to the duration of the late potentials and if it extended too far into the QRS complex, fast Fourier transform yielded random results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These patients included 66 survivors of out of hospital cardiac arrest and 35 patients presenting with hemodynamically well tolerated sustained ventricular tachycardia. On univariate analysis, patients in the cardiac arrest group had a lower incidence of previous myocardial infarction and left ventricular aneurysm and a higher ejection fraction compared with the ventricular tachycardia group. During electrophysiologic testing, the arrhythmia induced in the patients in the cardiac arrest group was fast and polymorphic and frequently degenerated into ventricular fibrillation. In contrast, in the ventricular tachycardia group, a slower, monomorphic and hemodynamically well tolerated ventricular tachycardia was commonly induced. On multivariate analysis, a polymorphic pattern of the induced ventricular arrhythmia was the only independent variable that distinguished the survivors of cardiac arrest from those presenting with sustained ventricular tachycardia. These results suggest that 1) the survivors of cardiac arrest and patients presenting with sustained well tolerated ventricular tachycardia are clinically distinct groups; and 2) the polymorphic tachycardia induced during programmed electrical stimulation in the survivors of cardiac arrest may indicate an unstable tachycardia mechanism. This may explain why these patients present with ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest, whereas others present with hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia.\r"

In the latter group the total mortality rate was 4% for those with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia and 11% for those with right ventricular dysplasia, and there were no deaths due to arrhythmia (p less than 0.05). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in Group I and Group II than in Group III. There were nonfatal recurrences of ventricular tachycardia in 33 to 56% of patients, and the number of these episodes did not differ significantly in those with and without coronary artery disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "It has been postulated that in cardiac tamponade, the hemodynamic effects of compression of the right heart chambers and great veins are more important than are the effects of left heart compression. In 10 anesthetized dogs with surgically compartmented pericardium, the hemodynamic effects of right atrial and right ventricular compression were compared with the hemodynamic effects of left atrial and left ventricular compression. The effects of right heart compression, left heart compression, and then effects of combined right and left heart compression, were compared at three levels of intrapericardial pressure: 10, 15 and 20 mm Hg. Aortic mean pressure decreased significantly at each level of intrapericardial pressure with right-sided tamponade but not with left-sided tamponade. Left atrial mean pressures decreased significantly with right-sided tamponade and increased with left-sided and combined tamponade. Right atrial mean pressures increased significantly with right-sided and combined tamponade, but not with left-sided tamponade. Heart rate increased significantly with each of the three varieties of tamponade. Cardiac output and stroke volume, which decreased with each variety of tamponade, were significantly lower during right-sided than during left-sided tamponade. Combined tamponade lowered stroke volume more than did right-sided tamponade, and lowered cardiac output more at 15 and 20 mm Hg intrapericardial pressure. It is concluded that, in this preparation, right-sided cardiac compression has more important hemodynamic effects than does left-sided compression. However, left-sided tamponade still makes a significant contribution to the total hemodynamic picture of cardiac tamponade.\r"

Sixteen patients (Group A) received routine care because of contraindication to thrombolytic therapy or other factors and 16 (Group B) received either tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase within 6 h of the onset of chest pain. The two groups were similar in left ventricular ejection fraction (mean +/- SD, 28 +/- 9% [Group A] versus 30 +/- 8% [Group B]) and occurrence of spontaneous nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, new bundle branch block and congestive heart failure. Group B patients had higher peak creatine kinase MB levels (446 +/- 336 versus 205 +/- 120 IU; p = 0.017) and earlier time to peak creatine kinase values (13.4 +/- 6.6 versus 19.1 +/- 6.1 h; p = 0.006). Twenty patients who had no clinical sustained ventricular arrhythmias underwent electrophysiologic study 13 +/- 6 days after infarction. Ventricular tachycardia was induced during the study in 7 (88%) of 8 Group A patients, but in only 1 (8%) of 12 Group B patients given thrombolytic therapy (p = 0.0008). During a mean follow-up period of 11 +/- 8 months, eight Group A patients (50%) died suddenly or were resuscitated from sustained ventricular tachycardia; all Group B patients are alive and have had no clinical arrhythmic events (p = 0.002).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether the success of internal mammary artery bypass grafting can be assessed intraoperatively using myocardial contrast echocardiography, sonicated Renografin-76 was injected into the aortic root of 11 dogs during the delivery of cardioplegic solution. Studies were performed with the left anterior descending coronary artery patent and totally occluded, and after internal mammary artery bypass grafting distal to the occluded vessel. Flow rate during cardioplegia was constant for all three stages in each experiment. Myocardial contrast echocardiography clearly demonstrated homogeneous myocardial perfusion with the left anterior descending coronary artery patent, lack of perfusion in the left anterior descending artery bed during its occlusion and excellent perfusion of the occluded bed after internal mammary artery bypass grafting distal to the occlusion in 10 of the 11 dogs. In one dog, the bypass graft was technically inadequate and contrast opacification was not noted in the left anterior descending artery bed after internal mammary artery bypass grafting. The exponential function C(t) = Ae-alpha t + Be-beta t was fitted to computer-derived time-intensity curves from the myocardium, where alpha denotes contrast washout and beta denotes contrast appearance. Respective values for alpha and beta (mean + 1 SD) were similar for the patent left anterior descending coronary artery and after internal mammary artery bypass grafting distal to the occluded artery (0.11 +/- 0.10 versus 0.10 +/- 0.10, and 2.5 +/- 2.4 versus 1.1 +/- 0.56). In conclusion, myocardial contrast echocardiography has potential for intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of coronary artery bypass grafting.\r"

At rest, both groups exhibited comparable systemic vascular resistance (control 45 +/- 14 versus heart failure 40 +/- 7 U) and femoral bed vascular resistance (control 18.7 +/- 6.9 versus heart failure 19.0 +/- 7.2 x 10(2) U) (both p = NS). Femoral bed resistance also decreased similarly in both groups during treadmill exercise (resistance at peak exercise: control 4.7 +/- 3.0 versus heart failure 4.9 +/- 0.9 x 10(2) U [p = NS]). In isolated gracilis muscle, vascular resistance was also comparable in both groups at rest (control 7.3 +/- 3.3 versus heart failure 10.2 +/- 3.6 x 10(3) U/100 g), at peak exercise (control 1.6 +/- 0.5 versus heart failure 1.8 +/- 0.9 x 10(3) U/100 g) and after maximal vasodilation with papaverine (control 0.7 +/- 0.3 versus heart failure 0.9 +/- 0.3 x 10(3) U/100 g) (all p = NS). These data suggest that chronic fluid and sodium retention in heart failure does not alter peripheral arteriolar behavior.\r"

The effect of the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol on infarct size in ischemia-reperfusion models has been variable, possibly because of differences in treatment duration. Adequate inhibition of xanthine oxidase may require a sufficient pretreatment period to permit conversion of allopurinol to oxypurinol, the actual inhibitor of superoxide production. To test more definitively whether xanthine oxidase-derived free radicals cause cell death during reperfusion, the effect of oxypurinol on infarct size was evaluated in an ischemia-reperfusion model. Open chest dogs underwent 40 min of circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion for 4 days. Twelve dogs were treated with oxypurinol (10 mg/kg body weight intravenously 10 min before occlusion and 10 mg/kg intravenously 10 min before reperfusion) and 11 control dogs received drug vehicle alone (pH 10 normal saline solution). Nine control dogs from a concurrent study also were included. Infarct size was measured histologically and analyzed with respect to its major baseline predictors, including anatomic area at risk and collateral blood flow (measured with radioactive microspheres). Infarct size as a percent of the area at risk averaged 23.8 +/- 2.7% (mean +/- SEM) in the oxypurinol group (n = 10) and 23.1 +/- 4.2% in the control group (n = 17) (p = NS). Collateral blood flow to the inner two thirds of the ischemic wall averaged 0.08 +/- 0.01 ml/min per g in the oxypurinol group and 0.09 +/- 0.02 ml/min per g in the control group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An echo-transponder system (Telectronics, Inc.) was compared with biplane fluoroscopy for left ventricular endocardial mapping. A 6F electrode catheter was modified with the addition of a piezoelectric crystal 5 mm from the tip. This crystal was connected to a transponder that received and transmitted ultrasound, resulting in a discrete artifact on the two-dimensional echocardiographic image corresponding to the position of the catheter tip. Catheters were introduced percutaneously into the left ventricle of nine anesthetized dogs. Two-dimensional echo-transponder and biplane fluoroscopic images were recorded on videotape with the catheter at multiple endocardial sites. Catheter location was marked by delivering radiofrequency current to the distal electrode, creating a small endocardial lesion. Catheter location by echo-transponder and by fluoroscopy were compared with lesion location without knowledge of other data. Location by echo-transponder was 8.7 +/- 5.1 mm from the center of the radiofrequency lesion versus 14 + 7.8 mm by fluoroscopy (n = 15, p = 0.023). Echo-transponder localization is more precise than is biplane fluoroscopy and may enhance the accuracy of left ventricular electrophysiologic mapping.\r"

Sites ranged in altitude from sea level to 4,500 m above sea level. Children were screened by physical examination, and an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram were performed on each child suspected of having a cardiac anomaly. A high prevalence of patent ductus arteriosus and atrial septal defect was found at the three high altitude sites and the effect of altitude was progressive. Both anomalies were postulated to be the result of the lower atmospheric oxygen tension present at high altitude. Failure of lower oxygen tension to constrict the ductus is thought to be the mechanism in patent ductus arteriosus. It is theorized that the persistence of high pulmonary vascular resistance and high right heart pressures at high altitude inhibits early closure of the foramen ovale. Subsequent growth may result in stretching of the fossa ovalis and incompetence of the flap and may produce an atrial septal defect. The high prevalence of atrial septal defect in tetralogy of Fallot is cited as a possible analogy because right ventricular pressure is high and right ventricular compliance is low from birth.\r"

Preoperative electrocardiograms (ECGs) at rest revealed an ectopic atrial rhythm in one patient. Postoperative rest ECGs revealed transient postoperative ectopic atrial or junctional rhythms in two patients, intermittent ectopic atrial rhythms in two and right bundle branch block in nine with a normal QRS axis. In addition, ambulatory monitor recordings revealed infrequent premature ventricular complexes in five patients. Catheter endocardial mapping revealed sinus rhythm in 18 patients and ectopic atrial rhythm in 1 patient. Atrial activation after the switch repair was comparable with normal atrial activation. Activation of all low atrial sites was significantly earlier after the switch repair than after the Mustard repair. Mild abnormalities of sinus node function were present and consisted of slight prolongation of corrected sinus node recovery time in six patients and slightly increased sinoatrial conduction time in four. The ratio of sinus node recovery time to sinus cycle length was normal in all 20 patients. Atrial effective and functional refractory periods were normal in all patients and no atrial arrhythmias could be induced by programmed stimulation. Atrioventricular (AV) node conduction was excellent with normal AV node effective and functional refractory periods. The only electrophysiologic abnormality of His-Purkinje function was distal right bundle branch block in nine patients. Programmed stimulation of the ventricle produced repetitive ventricular responses in four patients: bundle branch reentry in three and intraventricular reentry in one.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic utility of quantitative exercise thallium-201 imaging and compare it with that of cardiac catheterization in ambulatory patients. Accordingly, long-term (4 to 9 years) follow-up was obtained in 293 patients who underwent both tests for the evaluation of chest pain: 89 had undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 3 months of testing and were excluded from analysis, 119 experienced no cardiac events and 91 had an event (death in 20, nonfatal myocardial infarction in 21 and coronary artery bypass operations performed greater than 3 months after cardiac catheterization in 50). When all variables were analyzed using Cox regression analysis, the quantitatively assessed lung/heart ratio of thallium-201 activity was the most important predictor of a future cardiac event (chi 2 = 40.21). Other significant predictors were the number of diseased vessels (chi 2 = 17.11), patient gender (chi 2 = 9.43) and change in heart rate from rest to exercise (chi 2 = 4.19). Whereas the number of diseased vessels was an important independent predictor of cardiac events, it did not add significantly to the overall ability of the exercise thallium-201 test to predict events. Furthermore, information obtained from thallium-201 imaging alone was marginally superior to that obtained from cardiac catheterization alone (p = 0.04) and significantly superior to that obtained from exercise testing alone (p = 0.02) in determining the occurrence of events. In addition, unlike the exercise thallium-201 test, which could predict the occurrence of all categories of events, catheterization data were not able to predict the occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction. The exclusion of bypass surgery and previous myocardial infarction did not alter the results. In conclusion, data from this study demonstrate that exercise thallium-201 imaging may be superior to data from both exercise testing alone and cardiac catheterization data alone for predicting future events in ambulatory patients who have undergone both exercise thallium-201 imaging and catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the angiographic and hemodynamic determinants of dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression in patients with coronary artery disease, 41 patients with angiographically documented coronary disease who underwent dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy were studied. Dipyridamole-induced ST depression occurred in 14 (34%) of the 41 patients. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression was performed to compare the predictive value of angiographic findings (good coronary collateral vessels, jeopardized collateral vessels, multivessel disease), hemodynamic changes (changes in heart rate, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure and rate-pressure product), thallium-201 results (perfusion defect, thallium-201 redistribution) and demographic data (age, gender, medications). Only the presence of good coronary collateral vessels (p less than 0.02) and increases in rate-pressure product after dipyridamole infusion (p less than 0.02) were significant multivariate predictors of dipyridamole-induced ST depression. Good collateral vessels were more common in the group with ST depression (11 [79%] of 14) than they were in the group without ST depression (6 [22%] of 27; p less than 0.001). Rate-pressure product increased 2,835 +/- 1,648 beats/min.mm Hg in the group with ST depression compared with 1,179 +/- 1,417 beats/min.mm Hg in patients without ST depression (p less than 0.005). In conclusion, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression in patients with coronary artery disease appears to be related to 1) the presence of good coronary collateral vessels, which may act by facilitating \"coronary steal\", and 2) increases in rate-pressure product, reflecting increased myocardial oxygen demand. These observations may explain the lack of prognostic value of dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression described in previous reports.\r"

All 50 patients had severe three vessel coronary disease and represent approximately 5% of patients with three vessel disease who had revascularization in this institution; 8 (16%) had previous coronary bypass surgery, and 23 (46%) had previous myocardial infarction. Unstable angina was present in 33 patients (66%) and 96% had Canadian Heart Association class III or IV angina; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 57 +/- 11%. Angioplasty was performed in 176 vessels (3.5 vessels per patient, range 3 to 6) and in 250 lesions (5 lesions per patient, range 3 to 9); angiographic success was achieved in 240 lesions (96%) and 166 vessels (94%). Success in all vessels attempted was achieved in 40 (80%) of the 50 patients. Clinical success (angiographic success associated with clinical improvement) was obtained in all 50 patients in whom triple vessel angioplasty was performed; none of them required urgent bypass surgery and 5 patients (10%) had a non-Q wave myocardial infarction. In four other patients triple vessel angioplasty was planned but not performed because of failure to dilate the primary vessel; urgent bypass surgery was required in one of these, who developed a Q wave infarction. Thus, overall clinical success in 54 patients was 93%; the incidence rate of myocardial infarction was 11%, and that of urgent surgery 1.8%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

At early angiographic restudy (5 +/- 2 months after angioplasty) 37 patients (38%) had restenosis (defined as a stenosis greater than or equal to 50% of the luminal diameter or loss of greater than or equal to 50% of the gain achieved by angioplasty); progression of atherosclerosis was observed in 4 patients with and 7 without restenosis (13 versus 11%, p = NS). Ninety of the 98 patients underwent a late angiographic restudy a mean of 34 +/- 11 months after angioplasty. Late restenosis was found in one patient. Progression of coronary artery disease (defined as a greater than or equal to 20% decrease in the diameter of a vessel initially narrowed by greater than or equal to 50% or a greater than or equal to 30% decrease when the initial stenosis was less than 50%) was examined in relation to restenosis in 85 of the 90 patients.

In this retrospective analysis, progression of coronary artery disease between two cardiac catheterization procedures is described in 38 patients: 23 patients (Group I) who had a myocardial infarction between the two studies and 15 patients (Group II) who presented with one or more new total occlusions at the second study without sustaining an intervening infarction. In Group I the median percent stenosis on the initial angiogram of the artery related to the infarct at restudy was significantly less than the median percent stenosis of lesions that subsequently were the site of a new total occlusion in Group II (48 versus 73.5%, p less than 0.05). In the infarct-related artery in Group I, only 5 (22%) of 23 lesions were initially greater than 70%, whereas in Group II, 11 (61%) of 18 lesions that progressed to total occlusion were initially greater than 70% (p less than 0.01). In Group I, patients who developed a Q wave infarction had less severe narrowing at initial angiography in the subsequent infarct-related artery (34%) than did patients who developed a non-Q wave infarction (80%) (p less than 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analysis of angiographic and clinical characteristics present at initial angiography in Group I revealed proximal lesion location as the only significant predictor of evolution of lesions greater than or equal to 50% to infarction. This retrospective study suggests that myocardial infarction frequently develops from previously nonsevere lesions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study examined the feasibility and sensitivity of utilizing quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy and video-enhanced fluorescence imaging for plaque identification in atherosclerotic human necropsy arterial wall before and after laser atheroma ablation. With wide-band (450 to 490 nm) blue light excitation, the 540 nm fluorescence intensity ratio of normal to diseased sites (n = 13) was 2.09 +/- 0.82 (p less than 0.001) and video fluorescence imaging provided enhanced delineation of atheroma surface characteristics. Continuous argon and pulsed excimer (308 nm) laser ablation of atheroma decreased fluorescence intensity ratios by 42 and 20% (p less than 0.001), respectively (that is, from abnormal to nearly normal). Low power 325 nm laser-excited fluorescence spectroscopy from normal (n = 115) and abnormal (n = 146) necropsy sites revealed an average 45% decrease in atheroma fluorescence intensity (p less than 0.0001) and changes in fluorescence spectra appearance that corresponded to plaque morphologic subtypes. Studies using a dual laser system combining 325 nm laser-excited fluorescence plaque recognition and a 480 nm pulsed dye laser for tissue ablation with common optical fibers demonstrated normalization of both fluorescence intensity and spectra appearance after laser atheroma ablation. Thus, in vitro analysis of surface arterial fluorescence by quantitative spectroscopy and video fluorescence imaging reliably differentiate plaque from normal tissue and may provide the feedback signal needed to activate a laser source for selective plaque removal.\r"

To determine whether an impairment of the antibody response to polysaccharide antigens contributes to infections in this syndrome, we measured serum antibody to the teichoic acid of S. aureus and to the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type b. Compared to control subjects who had no history of S. aureus infections (N = 14), sera from patients with HIE (N = 9) lacked the expected elevation of serum antibody to teichoic acid (p greater than 0.05) and had significantly lower levels of this antibody than sera from 14 patients with atopic dermatitis, complicated by recurrent cutaneous S. aureus infections (p less than 0.01). After immunization with the capsular polysaccharide of Haemophilus influenzae type of vaccine, the antibody response of patients with HIE was significantly impaired compared to that of age-matched control subjects (p = 0.01). Although patients with HIE syndrome had normal total IgG levels, most patients with HIE but not patients with atopic dermatitis had IgG2 subclass deficiency. Defective antibody responses in patients with HIE were not restricted to polysaccharide antigens because the serum levels of antitetanus toxoid antibody in these patients were significantly lower than that of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Impaired antigen-specific antibody responses in patients with HIE syndrome may contribute to their increased susceptibility to infection.\r"

To characterize better IFAWBE of the species Solenopsis invicta, we evaluated the sera of 29 patients with systemic or large local reactions to imported fire ant (IFA) stings. Forty-eight percent (14/29) of these sting-sensitive patients were IFAWBE RAST positive (greater than or equal to 6% binding of total radioactivity added). With a pool of sera with an initial IFAWBE-RAST value of 16.2% binding, we evaluated RAST inhibition by IFA venom (IFAV), IFAWBE, and the venom component, transpiperidine. Maximum RAST inhibition obtained was 84% with 300 micrograms/ml of IFAV, 95% with 5 mg/ml of protein IFAWBE, and insignificant with undiluted transpiperdine. We conclude that IFAWBE contains large quantities of immunoreactive venom components other than transpiperidine and that the allergenicity of IFAWBE and venom resides in the small amount of protein present in IFAV.\r"

When subjects were challenged intradermally with 0.2 biologic unit (BU) of Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or grass pollen, wheal-and-flare reactions were elicited without subsequent LPRs. With 30 BU, all subjects developed LPRs, whereas 1 and 10 BU provoked LPRs in 28% and 64%, respectively. No biphasic responses were detected. At all concentrations which progressed to form an LPR, a palpable skin reaction was continuously present and either remained constant or increased steadily in magnitude during 6 hours. Skin reactions of similar diameter provoked by histamine resolved fully within 2 hours. Thus, we confirm that the development of a macroscopic cutaneous LPR requires a higher concentration of allergen than the wheal-and-flare reaction. Together with our other findings, these results suggest that all untreated atopic individuals are capable of mounting an LPR if they are challenged with sufficient allergen. In contrast to the asthmatic response to inhaled allergen, the cutaneous wheal and LPR are not biphasic.\r"

With the batch method, 14.6 +/- 1.7 mg of pollen solutes were eluted per 100 mg of dried defatted pollen in 1 minute; the 24-hour solute yield was 27.4 +/- 2.7 mg. With the column method, 3.7 +/- 1.3 mg of pollen solutes were eluted in 1 minute; the 24-hour solute yield was 29.3 +/- 2.1 mg. The kinetics of solute release with the column method were modeled as the simultaneous first-order elution of ragweed-pollen solutes into three hypothetical compartments. The theoretical initial solute concentration was 50 gm/L. The isoelectric focusing patterns, optical properties, distributions of enzymes, Ra5, and antigen E activities were consistent with the sequential separation of ragweed-pollen solutes and the three compartment model. Enzyme activities were eluted either maximally in the first minute (phosphatases and N-acetyl-beta-glucaminidase) or delayed until 10 minutes (leucine aminopeptidase). Ra5 was eluted rapidly, whereas antigen E was eluted during a more prolonged period. Pollen grain chromatography provides a simple, reproducible method for studying pollen solute release.\r"

ELISA and immunoblotting techniques were used for this purpose. A crude soy extract, as well as the 7S, 11S, and whey fractions, were isolated and purified for the in vitro studies from commercial defatted soy flakes. ELISA results demonstrated a statistically significant increased IgE and IgG response to the crude soy extract compared to that of normal control subjects. There was also an increase in IgE specific for 7S and IgG specific for 11S in the atopic group. The immunoblots reveal that IgE and IgG are present in varying amounts to multiple fractions of the soy protein. These results indicate that IgE and IgG specific to crude soy are elevated in patients with positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges to soy but that no one fraction is clearly more antigenic.\r"

A group of 108 healthy individuals served as control subjects. Ninety-four percent of the patients and 87% of the control subjects had at least one allergen-induced reaction (wheal greater than or equal to 2 by 2 mm). The prevalence of positive skin reactions to each aeroallergen was equally high in both groups. However, if a skin reaction is considered as positive only when an allergen-induced wheal is equal or larger compared to the 50% of the wheal obtained with the histamine control in that individual, 70% of the patients had positive skin reactions and only 38% of the control subjects were positive (p less than 0.05). Similarly, the prevalence rates to five aeroallergens (pollen, Fusarium, Mucor, Pullularia, and Curvularia) in the patient group were reduced to those levels observed with the control group, suggesting they are clinically less important. The age and not the sex influenced both the prevalence rates (p less than 0.001) and the mean size (p less than 0.01) of allergen and histamine-induced skin reactions. Lower prevalence rates and mean size values were observed in the youngest group (0 to 9 years). Moreover, there was an inverse relationship between lower skin reactivity with more younger subjects in our patient population. These results indicate that patients and healthy individuals have similar mechanisms for skin reactivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, conditioned medium (CM) from short-term cultures of nasal mucosal scrapings of subjects with allergic rhinitis are compared with those from normal subjects for colony-stimulating activities, with BMC and Eo CFU in methylcellulose assays of peripheral blood from atopic (N = 6) or nonatopic (N = 6) individuals. CM derived from cultures of nasal mucosal scrapings from subjects with allergic rhinitis stimulated a significantly greater number of BMC/Eo CFU from the peripheral blood of atopic (out-of-season and ragweed-allergic) subjects than from peripheral blood of nonatopic subjects in a series of matched-control experiments (20.6 +/- 4.6 versus 1.9 +/- 0.8; p less than 0.002); in contrast, nasal mucosal CM from normal control subjects did not stimulate an increase in these CFU in peripheral blood from atopic compared to nonatopic subjects. These studies further support the hypothesis that in situ hematopoietic mechanisms are operative in allergic inflammatory reactions and suggest the presence of cells in affected (allergic) epithelium that are \"activated\" to produce large amounts of BMC and Eo growth and differentiation factors.\r"

Symptoms could be reproduced in only four of the patients who performed strenuous exercise after ingestion of food to which they were skin sensitive. When symptoms appeared, that is, after a combination of food and exercise challenge, there was a marked increase in the wheal response to compound 48/80 (greater than 200%) and not to histamine. Food or exercise challenge alone did not induce any significant change in the skin reactivity to compound 48/80 or to histamine.

Four of these patients failed to respond to challenges with any of the sulfited foods. The other four patients experienced a decrease in pulmonary function on double-blind challenges with sulfited lettuce. Two of three of these patients reacted to challenges with dried apricots and white grape juice; the fourth patient has not yet been challenged with these products. Only one of these four patients reacted to challenges with dehydrated potatoes and mushrooms, and, in this case, the response to double-blind challenges with dehydrated potatoes was not consistent. None of the sulfite-sensitive subjects with asthma responded to challenges with sulfited shrimp. It is concluded that sulfite-sensitive subjects with asthma will not necessarily react after ingestion of sulfited foods. The likelihood of a reaction is dependent on the nature of the food, the level of residual sulfite, the sensitivity of the patient, and perhaps on the form of residual sulfite and the mechanism of the sulfite-induced reaction.\r"

  ".W": "A possible role of methylxanthines in the high incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in patients with asthma has been suggested. Therefore, we used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design to compare the effects of a 1-week conventional theophylline treatment and a 1-week placebo treatment in 16 adult patients with asthma. No oral or parenteral glucocorticoids were administered, but seven patients were taking inhaled corticoids. All patients needed inhaled adrenergic drugs. At the end of each period of theophylline or placebo treatment, the patients were carefully questioned with respect to respiratory and digestive symptoms, forced expiratory flows were measured, and GER was assessed by prolonged nocturnal intraesophageal pH monitoring. Peak expiratory flow was measured three times a day throughout the study. No significant increase in GER was found with theophylline compared to placebo, and forced expiratory flows improved with theophylline (p less than 0.05 for FEV1 and p less than 0.01 for peak expiratory flow rate). There was no correlation between GER, the duration of asthma, and forced expiratory flows. Thus, our study failed to demonstrate any adverse effect of a slow-release theophylline preparation on GER in patients with asthma. These results further suggest that the presence of GER is not a contraindication to the use of a slow-release theophylline in subjects with asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty individuals with history of immediate, objective, adverse reactions after shrimp ingestion underwent double-blind, placebo-controlled shrimp-food challenges. All individuals who did not exhibit a positive response (reproduction of objective symptoms) were administered an open challenge of 16 whole cooked shrimp. Positive challenge responses occurred in 9/30 subjects (30%); six of these subjects experienced a positive response during the double-blind phase. Of the 21 remaining subjects, 12 experienced generalized pruritus as their only symptom, whereas nine subjects had completely negative challenge responses. All placebo challenges were negative. Although a positive skin test was strongly associated with challenge symptoms (p less than 0.001), the shrimp prick skin test titration end points were not different among the challenge groups. The serum shrimp RAST percent was significantly higher in the positive challenge group (p less than 0.02). Mean levels of shrimp-specific serum IgG, IgA, and IgM levels were not different among the challenge groups. Although no single immunologic variable could be consistently used to identify subjects more likely to exhibit a positive challenge response, the composite of a positive shrimp prick skin test and elevated serum shrimp-specific IgE (RAST percent label bound greater than 11%) demonstrated a correct predictive value of 87% in this group of shrimp-sensitive subjects.\r"

The mechanism of PBTX-induced contractile response has been investigated by the authors in vitro in dog and rat tissue. PBTX stimulates neuronal sodium channels, resulting in activation of autonomic cholinergic and adrenergic nerve endings in canine upper and lower airway smooth muscle and in rat vas deferens, respectively. This article concerns the investigation of the effect and mechanism of action of PBTX on human airways in order to determine the unique role of the toxin in the pathogenesis of asthma. PBTX elicited contractions of isolated human airway smooth muscle with a threshold concentration of 0.1 micrograms/ml, very similar to values obtained in canine lower airways. Pharmacologic analysis demonstrated that atropine (10(-6) mol/L) blocked the response to both PBTX and acetylcholine; tetrodotoxin (10(-7) mol/L) blocked PBTX but not acetylcholine; and verapamil (10(-5) mol/L) attenuated but neostigmine (10(-8) mol/L) potentiated the response to PBTX. Other selected blockers did not affect the PBTX response. These data indicate that PBTX produces contraction of human lower airway smooth muscle via stimulation of cholinergic nerve fiber sodium channels. The concept that PBTX triggers asthma through this mechanism is strengthened by these results.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a mechanism of action of autoantibodies reactive with the C1 esterase inhibitor (C1EI) molecule found in three patients with acquired angioedema without associated diseases. All of these patients have a circulating C1EI of lower molecular weight than that of normal control subjects. When native C1EI was added to patient, but not control, plasmas, it was cleaved to a lower molecular weight fragment under conditions that allowed contact system activation. In a partially purified system, patient immunoglobulin preparations impaired stable complex formation between plasmin and C1EI and exaggerated the cleavage of the latter to a lower molecular weight fragment. We propose that the autoantibody does not interfere with the cleavage of the bait sequence of the inhibitor but reduces the availability of the reactive center of the molecule in a way that interferes with the irreversible inhibition of target enzymes. In this way unregulated activation of the kinin and complement pathways occurs, leading to disease manifestations via as yet uncharacterized mediators.\r"

  ".U": "88244374\r", 
  ".W": "We previously screened a series of macrophage hybridomas derived from fusion of P388D1 (H-2d) tumor cells with CKB (H-2k) splenic adherent cells for their ability to induce I-J restricted Ts cell responses. One Ia+ macrophage clone (63) consistently induced Ag-specific, I-J-restricted Ts. To evaluate whether macrophage hybridoma 63 also induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) immunity, mice were immunized with hapten-coupled macrophage hybridoma cells. Hapten-coupled splenic adherent cells and control macrophage hybridomas induced significant primary DTH responses, whereas hapten-coupled macrophage 63 induced little or no immunity when injected into H-2 compatible hosts. However, macrophage hybridoma 63 specifically activated I-Ak, I-Ad, or I-Ed restricted T cell hybridomas/clones, in vitro in the presence of appropriate Ag. Three different strategies designed to eliminate suppressor cell activity were successfully used to demonstrate that hapten-coupled macrophage 63 could also induce in vivo immunity. First, after immunization with hapten-coupled macrophages, mice were treated with cyclophosphamide. Second, macrophage 63 was treated with anti-IJ idiotype antibody before 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenyl acetyl hapten (NP) coupling. Finally, haptenated macrophages were injected into I-A compatible but I-J incompatible recipients. These protocols are known to inhibit the induction of Ts activity, thus these results indirectly suggest that there is stimultaneous generation of Ts activity in vivo. The latter hypothesis was tested in adoptive transfer experiments. Transfer of lymph node cells from NP-63 primed B10.BR (H-2k) mice induced immunity in naive 4R animals, whereas the same number of immune cells suppressed NP-induced DTH responses in 5R mice. The combined results indicate that a cloned macrophage line can activate both Th and Ts cells. Macrophages which induce Ts activity may be responsible for maintaining the balance of immunity vs suppression. The data support the hypothesis that IJ interacting molecules (IJ-IM) expressed on macrophages are critical for induction of suppressor cell activity.\r"

  ".W": "Primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is characterized by the presence of immune complexes (IC), high levels of polymeric IgA (pIgA), and IgA rheumatoid factor (RF) in the blood. The impaired capacity of serum to solubilize IC in the presence of normal values of C hemolytic activity as well as high serum levels of C3, C4, and properdin factor B have led us to analyze whether pIgA and IgA RF from patients with IgAN where capable of inhibiting the capacity of normal human serum to solubilize immune precipitates (BSA-anti-BSA) preformed at equivalence. The results showed a significant reduced mean capacity of serum from patients with IgAN to solubilize \"in vitro\" immune precipitates (p less than 0.001) and significant high mean levels of pIgA (p less than 0.001) and IgA RF (p less than 0.005) in the blood. Increasing amounts of pIgA inhibited solubilization of IC in the fluid phase, and inhibitory activity was also shown by the IgA RF. There were inverse correlations between pIgA and the capacity of serum to solubilize IC (r = -0.36; p less than 0.05), and between IgA RF and the complement-mediated solubilization (r = -0.57; p less than 0.001). It is suggested that pIgA and IgA RF may be responsible for the impaired complement-mediated solubilization of serum and the persistence of insoluble nephritogenic IC in the blood of patients with primary IgAN.\r"
