  ".W": "Arterial compliance was measured in 70 healthy volunteers, 13 athletes, and 17 patients with coronary artery disease. Magnetic resonance images were acquired at end diastole and end systole through the ascending aorta, the aortic arch, and the descending thoracic aorta. Regional compliance was derived from the change in luminal area in a slice of known thickness and from the pulse pressure. Total arterial compliance was also measured from the left ventricular stroke volume and the pulse pressure. In the volunteers, mean (SD) regional compliance (microliters/mm Hg) was greatest in the ascending aorta (37 (18], lower in the arch (31 (15], and lowest in the descending aorta (18 (8], and it decreased with age. Compliance in the athletes was significantly higher than in their age matched controls (41 (16) versus 22 (11) microliters/mm Hg). In the patients with coronary artery disease it was significantly lower (12 (4) v 18 (10] than in age matched controls. Total arterial compliance also fell with age in those with coronary artery disease although there was more variation. The results suggest a possible role for compliance in the assessment of cardiovascular fitness and the detection of coronary artery disease.\r"

In all cases imaging was successful and produced diagnostic images of high resolution. Coarctation was shown in 12 cases. The position and shape of the coarctation were well displayed by the magnetic resonance images. In addition, they clearly showed the relation of the coarctation to arteries arising from the aortic arch and to the length and diameter of the aortic isthmus and the distal aortic arch. The anatomy was confirmed at operation in all 12 patients, except for two with a small ductus arteriosus (arterial duct), which was not seen in the magnetic resonance images. In the seven remaining patients, coarctation was excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging produced high quality images that showed the anatomy better than other non-invasive methods. It provided all the anatomical information required for surgical correction.\r"

  ".W": "Following anaesthesia with enflurane, some patients receiving isoniazid have increased serum concentrations of fluoride ion, presumably because of induction of an isozyme of cytochrome P450 which is responsible for enflurane biodegradation. In rats, isoniazid and ethanol enhance metabolism of enflurane and also induce a form of cytochrome P450 which is homologous with a form of rabbit liver cytochrome P450 known as 3a. Isoniazid, ethanol and imidazole increase the concentration of cytochrome P450 3a in hepatic microsomes. We have pretreated rabbits with imidazole, the most potent of the three inducers of isozyme 3a, to determine if the hepatic microsomal metabolism of enflurane is enhanced and if purified isozyme 3a catalyses the oxidation of enflurane. Imidazole produced a 250% increase in the hepatic microsomal metabolism of enflurane, sevoflurane, methoxyflurane and the control substrate, aniline. Polyclonal antibodies to cytochrome P450 3a inhibited 90% of enflurane metabolism, but only 40% of methoxyflurane biotransformation in the microsomes from imidazole-pretreated rabbits. Thus isozyme 3a or a structurally similar cytochrome P450 seemed to catalyse almost all microsomal metabolism of enflurane. In addition, purified cytochrome P450 3a catalysed the metabolism of enflurane, sevoflurane and methoxyflurane, and the oxidation of these anaesthetics by cytochrome P450 3a was stimulated four-fold by cytochrome b5, a protein which serves as an alternate source of electrons for some cytochrome P450 reactions.\r"

The end-point of induction of anaesthesia was inability to open eyes upon command. Dose-response curves were determined for each group with a probit procedure and compared with an isobolographic analysis. Midazolam was found to act in synergism with methohexitone for induction of anaesthesia. Twenty-seven percent ED50 for methohexitone was required in combination with 33% of ED50 for midazolam to achieve the ED50 of the combination. This degree of synergism is in agreement with that described in animal research.\r"

A threshold Nb latency of 44.5 ms was chosen to discriminate between an early cortical AER containing three waves and that with two waves of longer latency. When Nb latency decreased below this threshold, four of the patients has positive responses, indicating awareness. The addition of a volatile anaesthetic abolished any response, and increased Nb latency to more than 44.5 ms. The three wave AER pattern, therefore, is associated with a depth of anaesthesia at which awareness occurs.\r"

During the i.v. administration of successive 50-mg doses of thiopentone, the mean activity of the genioglossus, sternothyroid and sternohyoid (strap muscles), and scalene muscles decreased. There was a wide variation in response, with frequent activation of the scalene and strap muscles after small doses of thiopentone. The activity of the strap and scalene muscles changed from a tonic pattern to activity in phase with inspiration. Airway obstruction was frequent and accompanied by significant increases in phasic muscle action which did not overcome the obstruction. The pattern of changes observed suggests that loss of tonic activity in the sternothyroid and sternohyoid muscles is associated with airway obstruction.\r"

The performance of the controller was evaluated at two target arterial pressures (AP), by its response to simulated changes in AP and by a comparison with a further group of eight patients with manual control of AP. The controller's undershoot of AP (range 2.8 +/- 0.5-4.5 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) and % time spent within +/- 5 mm Hg of the target AP (range 83 +/- 3.4-89 +/- 2.2%) were acceptable and equalled the manual performance figures (range 3.3 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; 90 +/- 5%).

Signal processing was made offline. Spectral information from 2-s EEG segments was extracted using autoregressive modelling. Repetitive hierarchical clustering was used to define a common learning set of basic patterns. With this learning set, the EEG was classified, and the results presented in a class probability histogram. The basic patterns were related to the clinical depth of anaesthesia in all patients and assigned specific colours. Using this colour code, the class probability histogram showed a high degree of simplicity. Decreasing or increasing the isoflurane concentration caused the same trend in the class profile in all patients. This indicates that the EEG pattern might be a sensitive tool for decision making during administration of general anaesthetics.\r"

During induction and the pre-bypass period, significant decreases in systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) (P less than 0.01) were noted. The decrease in LVSWI with unchanged filling pressures indicated myocardial depression. Serum catecholamine concentrations remained at the pre-induction value until cardiopulmonary bypass, when a significant increase was noted. Tracheal intubation, sternotomy and sternal spread were not associated with hypertension or tachycardia. Clinical signs that could reflect myocardial ischaemia were not observed peroperatively.

  ".W": "In a current Netherlands study on the effects on mother and child of infection with the human parvovirus B19 during pregnancy, 10 pregnancies have been reported. Three of them ended before term: two in fetal death and one by elective abortion. In two of these fetuses B19 infection in cells other than those of the erythroid series was demonstrated, and in the one terminated, ocular malformation and extensive inflammatory reactions in all fetal and placental tissues were found. The presence of B19 DNA was demonstrated by dot hybridization in placental and fetal tissues. In the third no gross fetal abnormalities were found, although B19 DNA was detected in several fetal tissues by in-situ hybridization. Of the remaining seven pregnancies, six ended at term in the birth of apparently healthy babies. The other child was born near term with a low birthweight and multiple congenital malformations, but with no proof of intrauterine B19 infection. It is concluded that B19 infection in pregnancy can interfere with organ development and may lead to intrauterine fetal death.\r"

  ".W": "Although progestogens protect the endometrium against excessive oestrogen-induced stimulation, they can cause adverse symptomatic and psychological effects and may have undesirable metabolic consequences. Thus, the minimum progestogen dose which results in consistent endometrial transformation should be prescribed. To define this dose for norethisterone and dl-norgestrel, 197 endometrial samples obtained from postmenopausal women receiving conjugated equine oestrogens (0.625 mg or 1.25 mg daily) with one of six doses of norethisterone (or the acetate), or one of three doses of dl-norgestrel added for the first 12 days of each calendar month were examined with the light microscope; 109 samples were also assessed by transmission electron microscopy. There was an inverse relation between the percentage of samples showing proliferative features and the progestogen dose. However, proliferative endometrium was observed in 6% of samples with the highest dose of dl-norgestrel (500 micrograms) and in 3% of samples with 2.5 mg norethisterone. Conversely, complete secretory transformation was observed in 25% of samples with the lowest dose of norethisterone (0.1 mg) and in 40% of samples with 75 micrograms dl-norgestrel. Mild atypical hyperplasia was diagnosed in four samples. There was a wide inter-patient variation in response and none of the nine progestogen dose regimens induced secretory change in every patient.\r"

In the first analysis, average birthweight in children with NDD was 3138 g (SD 592) which was significantly less than in normally developed children, 3280 g (SD 491) (P less than 0.0005). After correction for confounding factors, birthweight-for-gestation (Z score) remained lower in children with NDD (-0.42) than normal children (-0.21) (P less than 0.0025). In the second analysis the fetal growth achievement of children, who had NDD after the prenatal complications, severe hypertension, unclassified antepartum haemorrhage and preterm uterine activity, was significantly less (Z score, -0.76) than children who were normally developed after the same maternal prenatal complications (Z score, -0.37) (P less than 0.03). In the third analysis, a risk analysis to assess the relative importance of fetal growth achievement and prenatal complications in the genesis of NDD suggested that the latter was the dominant factor. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that prenatal complications, severe enough to retard fetal growth, can compromise fetal brain development and make an important contribution to NDD.\r"

Ten severely symptomatic women with detrusor instability were assessed clinically and urodynamically before and after a course of biofeedback. Statistically significant improvements in the symptoms of urgency and urge incontinence were found. Five of the seven women who agreed to have repeat cystometry had stable cystometrograms.

The maximum intraocular concentration (24 (SD 9) mg/l) was achieved four hours after topical administration. This level was slightly less than that found in aqueous humour (28 (SD 10) mg/l) 12 hours after systemic administration of the drug at a dosage of 5 mg/kg/day. Both these levels are below the minimum therapeutic level (50-100 mg/l). Topical application of cyclosporin A did not produce detectable levels in plasma at any time. These results indicate that the efficacy of cyclosporin A in the control of intraocular inflammation is attributable to its systemic immunoregulatory effect rather than to the local ocular effect.\r"

However, the difference between the two sampling sites was highly variable between individuals, ranging from a maximum mean site difference of 64.5. mosm/kg for one of the six cul-de-sacs found to be significantly hypertonic, to a mean site difference of 25.0 mosm/kg for one of the two cul-de-sacs found to be significantly hypotonic.

  ".W": "Patients with serious inflammatory Graves' ophthalmopathy should be treated with anti-inflammatory drugs or radiotherapy to prevent complications like fibrosis, while those with non-inflammatory ophthalmopathy may be treated by surgery immediately. It is often difficult, however, to distinguish inflammatory from non-inflammatory Graves' disease. We therefore present a simple clinical classification here to differentiate between these two conditions. This classification is based on the classical signs of inflammation--pain, redness, swelling, and impaired function. After two consecutive clinical examinations an 'activity score' can be determined, ranging from 0 to 10 points. In a retrospective study testing the efficacy of this classification we found that patients with an activity score of 3 or more at the beginning of therapy responded well to anti-inflammatory drugs, while those with a lower activity score mostly did not. Comparing the pretreatment activity score with the degree of enlargement of the extraocular muscles on the CT scan, we found a significant correlation between these two parameters: the higher the activity score, the more the enlargement of the muscles. We conclude that this classification facilitates the proper selection of patients for treatment.\r"

We measured corneal thickness in nine patients with infantile nephropathic cystinosis. We also studied a corneal button from one of these patients who underwent corneal transplantation. All nine patients had increased corneal thickness in comparison with an age matched control population. Electron microscopy analysis of the cystinotic button revealed structural changes of both epithelium and endothelium layers.

DEN4 was propagated in BFU-E-derived colonies and replication was dependent on erythropoietin. DEN4 was not cytotoxic. In inoculated cultures, diffuse bursts with many clusters contained large amounts of DEN4 RNA. In contrast to dengue infection of macrophages, virus propagation in semisolid culture was sustained and not enhanced by subneutralizing amounts of antibody. DEN4 also was efficiently propagated in human hematopoietic cell lines, especially those with erythroid properties. In K562 cells, DEN4 infection persisted for months; greatly slowed cell growth, again without cytotoxicity; and resulted in cytopathic changes in cell appearance. Flaviviruses can infect human hematopoietic cells and alter their proliferative capacity.\r"

As the cells collected by leukapheresis were contaminated with many visible cell clumps, platelets, and erythrocytes, they were separated from the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) by slow-speed centrifugation and fractionated on a discontinuous gradient of Percoll. All the hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM) in the starting samples were recovered at the interface of 40% and 60% Percoll solutions largely free of other cellular components and with a substantial reduction in volume. The separation and freezing procedures could be completed within three hours after obtaining cells by leukapheresis. After their fractionation and storage, these PBSC were shown to be able to reconstitute normal hematopoiesis in ten children with poor prognosis leukemia or neuroblastoma for whom no HLA-compatible marrow donors were available and who had been subjected to marrow-ablative therapy. This separation procedure is simple, efficient, and readily available and can be used for children as a routine procedure for PBSC autotransplantation.\r"

Disappearance of circulating neutrophils and development of RBC and platelet transfusion-dependence was followed, in the evaluable patients, by reappearance of 0.5 x 10(9)/L circulating granulocytes and sufficient platelets to obviate the need for platelet transfusions at a median of 25 days after transplantation. Twenty-three patients experienced a clinical complete remission (CR). The projected 2-year event-free survival was 24% for all 40 patients and 49% for the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients. The projected 18-month event-free survival for the Hodgkin's disease patients was 15%.

Each drug, however, has significant toxicity against normal marrow progenitor cells that frequently proves dose-limiting in patients. In this study, AZT and recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha 2a) were tested as single agents and in combination against normal myeloid (CFU-GM) and erythroid (BFU-E) colony forming cells in a standard methylcellulose culture assay. The data were analyzed using a quantitative computerized analysis based on the median-effect principle and the isobologram equation as described by Chou and Talalay (Adv Enz Regul 22:27, 1984). The ED90 for BFU-E and CFU-GM inhibition was then compared with previously measured in vivo plasma levels of each drug and the ED90 for the anti-HIV-1 effect in vitro. We demonstrate that (a) the drugs are strongly synergistic in inhibiting marrow progenitor cell growth and that this synergism occurs at drug levels that are within the range of measured plasma levels in phase I clinical trials, (b) BFU-E are more sensitive than CFU-GM to the inhibiting effects of AZT, rIFN-alpha 2a or both drugs in combination, (c) the drug concentrations in combination that synergistically inhibit bone marrow progenitors are much higher than those required to inhibit HIV-1 replication in vitro, and (d) the anti-HIV-1 effect for the combination of AZT and rIFN-alpha 2a was clearly superior to the effect of AZT or rIFN-alpha 2a alone as indicated by the combination index and the dose-reduction index. These data suggest that substantially lower doses of AZT and rIFN-alpha than those currently being tested in clinical trials might not only maintain a strong synergistic anti-HIV-1 effect but might also avoid significant hematologic toxicity.\r"

Fourteen (58%) of the platelet samples from refractory ITP patients but none (0%) from the non-ITP or control donors had PBIgG greater than 800 molecules IgG/platelet. Seventeen of 24 (71%) of the ITP patients had platelets which demonstrated increased monocyte-platelet rosette formation [rosette index (RI) greater than 2], whereas only four (11%) of the non-ITP patients had such platelets. There was a direct correlation between PBIgG and rosette index for the platelets from resistant ITP patients. There was no correlation of severity of thrombocytopenia with PBIgG or rosette index. Monocyte-platelet interaction in the presence of elevated PBIgG is mediated through the monocyte Fc-receptor. Platelets from five of ten refractory ITP patients with PBIgG less than 800 molecules IgG/platelet had increased rosette formation. Monocyte-platelet interaction in the absence of increased PBIgG may be due to small amounts of platelet surface IgG which are still able to mediate monocyte Fc-receptor interaction or to alternate membrane receptor interaction through the monocyte C3 receptor. Our data underscore the pathophysiologic relevance of monocyte/macrophage-mediated interaction in immune platelet destruction syndromes.\r"

  ".W": "Covalent attachment of fatty acid to proteins plays an important role in association of certain proteins with hydrophobic membrane structures. In platelets, the structure of many membrane glycoproteins (GPs) has been examined in detail, but the question of fatty acid acylation of platelet proteins has not been addressed. In this study, we wished to determine (a) whether platelet proteins could be fatty acid acylated; and, if so, (b) whether these modified proteins were present in isolated platelet membranes and cytoskeletal fractions; and (c) if the pattern of fatty acid acylated proteins changed on stimulation of the platelets with the agonist thrombin. We observed that in platelets allowed to incorporate 3H-palmitate, a small percentage (1.37%) of radioactivity incorporated into the cells became covalently bound to protein. Selective cleavage of thioester, thioester plus O-ester, and amide-linked 3H-fatty acids from proteins, and their subsequent analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the greatest part of 3H-fatty acid covalently bound to protein was thioester-linked 3H-palmitate. By sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and fluorography, at least ten major radiolabeled proteins were detected. Activation of platelets by thrombin greatly increased the quantity of 3H-palmitoylated proteins associated with the cytoskeleton. Nearly all radiolabeled proteins were recovered in the membrane fraction, indicating that these proteins are either integral or peripheral membrane proteins or proteins tightly associated to membrane constituents. Components of the GPIIb-IIIa complex were not palmitoylated. Thus, platelet proteins are significantly modified posttranslationally by 3H-palmitate, and incorporation of palmitoylated proteins into the cytoskeleton is a prominent component of the platelet response to thrombin stimulation.\r"

Overexpression, with or without gene amplification, is seen in the development of drug resistance in culture and it has been postulated that genetic modulation of mdr-1/P-170 and DHFR may also be involved in the development of clinical drug resistance. We screened lymphoblasts from 28 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) for evidence of overexpression of mdr-1/P-170 using RNAse protection, RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Overexpression of mdr-1/P-170 without gene amplification was detected in samples from four patients (three after multiple relapses, one at presentation). Overexpression of mdr-1/P-170 was heterogeneous within the population of malignant lymphoblasts as demonstrated by RNA in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and drug uptake using daunomycin autofluorescence analysis. There was no evidence of overexpression of DHFR in any of the eight patient samples tested by RNAse protection nor was there any evidence of gene amplification in 11 patient samples on Southern blot analysis. From these observations it appears that overexpression without gene amplification of mdr-1/P-170 may be one mechanism of clinical drug resistance in ALL.\r"

Prevalence rates were highest among patients with sickle cell anemia and sickle cell anemia with thalassemia genotypes. Among sickle cell anemia patients free of ulcers at entry, the overall incidence was 5.73 per 100 person years in those having associated alpha-thalassemia and 9.97 for those without. Among sickle cell anemia patients with two alpha genes, the estimated incidence of leg ulcers is 2.38 per 100 person years and 6.12 per 100 person years among sickle cell anemia patients with three alpha genes (P less than .05). In both groups, the incidence was highest among those patients over 20 years of age and considerably higher among males than females (P less than .001). Leg ulcers were nonexistent in patients with sickle beta plus thalassemia and sickle hemoglobin C disease. Low steady-state hemoglobin is associated with a higher incidence of ulcer formation (P less than .0001) in sickle cell anemia patients. The protective effect of hemoglobin F is apparent at all levels of total hemoglobin among sickle cell anemia patients and those with associated alpha-thalassemia.\r"

From 17 weeks until 37 weeks of gestation, zeta-globin chains were present in almost all fetal and cord blood samples (0.27% +/- 0.15% in samples of weeks 17 through 30; 0.14% +/- 0.11% in samples of weeks 31 through 37). zeta-Globin chains were present in greater than 80% of cord blood hemolysates from normal, full-term newborns (0.15% +/- 0.11%) as well as from 16 near-term newborns of diabetic mothers (0.13% +/- 0.13%). zeta-Globin chains were not detected in normal infants aged 3 months to 2 years. In cord blood hemolysates from alpha-thalassemic newborns, the levels of zeta-globin chain content varied from very high to undetectable levels. Gene mapping of the zeta-alpha-globin gene cluster was performed in 12 newborns in whom cord blood zeta-globin chains had been determined. Newborns who were carriers of alpha-thalassemia-1 due to the (--SEA/) deletion had very high levels of zeta-globin chains (greater than 1.5%).\r"

  ".W": "We have established four hybridoma cells that produce monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) R2, R4, R6, and R12 directed toward recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). MoAbs R2, R4, and R6 bound to EPO with high affinities (kd = approximately 2, 4, and 1 nmol/L, respectively) but MoAb R12 had a low affinity (240 nmol/L). These antibodies inhibited the biological activity of rHuEPO and EPOs from humans, rats, mice, and rabbits. This inhibition was due to the blocking of EPO binding to the target cells. The fully deglycosylated rHuEPO bound to the MoAbs, indicating that they recognized peptide sequences of the antigen but not the carbohydrates attached to the antigen. An immunosorbent column with the immobilized MoAb R2 was effective for the rapid purification of EPO. MoAb R6 bound to EPO at a site(s) different from those to which other MoAbs bound. Based on this finding, a sensitive and rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of EPO, in which EPO was sandwiched between two MoAbs (R2 and R6), was developed. The assay measured plasma levels of EPO as low as 5 mU/mL within several hours.\r"

In nine patients (36%), the S1 nerve root sheaths were first recognized at the level of the lumbosacral disc. In 14 patients (56%), the sheaths emerged cranial to the disc; it is possible that these patients may be more prone to neurological complications related to disc or facet joint disease, especially if the sheath is laterally sited within the lateral recess. Conversely, that minority of patients (two, 8%) in whom the root sheaths emerge caudal to the disc level may be relatively protected from neurological complications.\r"

Of 32 cases treated in 1983, 23 had both CT scans and coronal plane tomography prior to radiotherapy. At the end of 1983 these radiographs were reviewed and an assessment made of their value in treatment planning. As a result of this review it was decided that cancers of the larynx confined to the vocal cords should routinely have conventional coronal plane tomograms rather than CT scans. All other cases were to have CT scans and not tomograms. The results of following this policy in 1984 confirm that it is effective. There was no detriment to patients with early vocal cord cancers in performing coronal plane tomograms rather than CT scans. The survival at 24 months of both cohorts was 93%. In the more invasive cancers of the larynx, greater information about the extent of the disease was obtained using CT scans, and improved treatment plans resulted. When compared with a historical group, there appears to be an advantage for local control, 27.3% of the study group suffering local recurrence as opposed to 53.6% of the historical group.\r"

The occupational-dose data for 1986 were compared with data for 1981 to identify any areas where changes in workload, equipment or techniques had led to increases in whole-body or organ doses. The results demonstrate that the level of whole-body occupational dose received by the vast majority of NHS employees in the North-Western Regional Health Authority is, as expected, extremely low. However, two specific areas were identified where occupational doses are relatively high and need to be carefully monitored. The review has also led to a number of operational changes being implemented by the Approved Dosimetry Service.\r"

Using drug concentrations similar to those seen following in vivo administration in patients, MPA produced greater than or equal to 50% inhibition of 75SeM uptake in 5 of 23 cases. The comparable proportion for doxorubicin was 4 of 5 and for mitozantrone 7 of 12. Methotrexate and Vinblastine were much less effective. In all cases where greater than or equal to 50% inhibition was obtained with doxorubicin and mitozantrone the carcinoma had spread beyond the kidney.

The maximum and average urine flow rates of the first voids in both sexes were compared with the respective voided volumes. Nomogram charts, in centile form, for both the maximum and average urine flow rates were constructed using statistical transformations of the data. Males showed a significant decline in both urinary flow rates with age, although there was no statistically significant variation in either urine flow rate with respect to first versus repeated voiding. Females showed no statistically significant variation in either urine flow rate with respect to age, parity or first versus repeated voiding. The maximum and average urine flow rates in both sexes showed an equally strong relationship to voided volume. No artificial restriction of voided volume, e.g. minimum 200 ml, appeared appropriate.

Early progression (in the first 3 years) occurred in 2% of the patients with diploid ABH positive tumours and in 31% of those with aneuploid ABH negative tumours. The 5-year survival rates corrected for intercurrent mortality were 95 and 56% respectively. In a Cox multivariate analysis, T category, age at diagnosis and histological grade emerged as significant independent prognostic indicators of bladder cancer death, whereas ABH reactivity and DNA ploidy had no significant independent value. However, if the combination of ABH reactivity and DNA ploidy was included in the Cox model, this and T category were independent predictors. When this Cox model was applied to assess the risk of progression, the only independent prognostic factor was the combination of ABH reactivity and DNA ploidy.\r"

Routine blind antibiotic prophylaxis is not always effective and there is a tendency to over-use potent new and expensive antimicrobials. Attempts to \"sterilise\" the urine preoperatively are also expensive and disruptive. However, appropriate treatment/prophylaxis can be administered economically using rapidly obtained laboratory results. We describe here a technique of routine direct antibiotic sensitivity testing (DST) of the patient's urine pre-operatively and before catheter removal. Such testing can be performed by junior medical staff in a ward side-room. An appropriate antibiotic may then be administered parenterally 1 h before surgery or catheter removal. A total of 102 consecutive patients underwent TURP and only 1 of those with infected urine became septicaemic. In this instance, an appropriate antibiotic had been incorrectly given orally before removal of the catheter. If the antibiotic sensitivities of a patient's urine are known, and an appropriate antibiotic is given parenterally 1 h pre-operatively or before catheter removal, the incidence of septicaemia following transurethral surgery may be significantly reduced.\r"

We have studied 182 patients with azoospermia who underwent vasoepididymostomy. The pre-operative and operative findings which adversely affected the function of the anastomosis were identified. The presence of spermatozoa in the semen sample was taken to mean a successful anastomosis. Abnormal testicular histology was an adverse pre-operative finding. Adverse operative findings included non-canalisation of the epididymal tubules and hypoplasia of the epididymis; both factors were associated with a high failure rate (almost 100%). The anastomosis was a failure in 78% of the patients when no fluid was seen on sectioning the epididymis. In the absence of adverse findings the success rate of vasoepididymostomy was 59%. Pre-operative testicular biopsy, together with careful observation and recording of findings before and during surgery, are recommended to avoid needless exploration and anastomosis.\r"

The proportion of pure seminoma was associated with the height of the testis, being 87% in abdominal. 78% in inguinal and 50% in normally positioned testes. In patients operated upon for cryptorchidism, the current site of the testis seemed to be a more important determinant of this proportion than the original site. The proportion of pure seminoma which developed in testes after successful orchiopexy was equal to that in normally-descended testes (50%) and lower (39%) if orchiopexy had been performed before the age of 16 years. Similarly, among non-seminomas, a higher proportion of tumours containing teratoma tissue was found in cryptorchidism was successfully treated in childhood. It was concluded that a successful orchiopexy in childhood decreases especially the risk of seminoma.\r"

The mechanism of penile detumescence is still under debate. Single and combined cavernous and hypogastric nerve stimulation was used to study the influence of the sympathetic nervous system on penile erection and to identify the mechanism of penile detumescence. Penile arterial flow and intracorporeal pressure recordings during various stimulation patterns indicated that erection induced by stimulation of the cavernous nerve could be blocked by excitation of the upper hypogastric nerves. Venous outflow studies demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of the sympathetic nervous system was due to active vaso- and corporeal smooth muscle constriction. It was concluded that subsidence and suppression of erection is a sympathetic function. Previous studies have shown that the neurophysiology of erection can be explained by 3 major inhibitory (sympathetic). Our findings are of clinical importance, since a better appreciation of the basic erectile mechanism is essential for successful management of erectile dysfunction.\r"

In this latter group symptoms related to the primary lesion were variable. The distinction between primary and secondary neoplasm is an important one and was rarely made on the basis of endoscopic or clinical findings alone. Urachal tumours were more common in females, whereas primary and secondary vesical adenocarcinomas were more common in males. The urachal tumours also occurred in a younger age group. Most of the adenocarcinomas, urachal or primary, were already advanced at the time of diagnosis. All tumours were palpable bimanually after resection and were at least T2 or T3. In the urachal carcinomas the results of partial cystectomy were disappointing because of the high rate of local recurrence and death from metastases. Primary non-urachal vesical adenocarcinoma carried an even poorer prognosis if non-radical surgery was carried out. The mean survival was 13 months. Radiotherapy was not effective in urachal and primary adenocarcinomas as these tumours are generally radioresistant. The treatment of secondary adenocarcinoma was governed by the primary site of the tumour. Radical surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy appeared to give the longest survival in the colonic tumours. Patients with prostatic cancer had a poorer survival rate than those with the same stage tumour but without bladder involvement, with renal failure secondary to obstructive uropathy being the commonest cause of death.\r"

AM demonstrated significantly lower end filling pressures compared with CMG. Phasic detrusor contractions were found more commonly during AM and the frequency of phasic detrusor contractions during AM was associated significantly with poor compliance identified during CMG. Patients with upper tract dilatation had significantly greater residual urine volumes, higher pressure rises during CMG and higher frequencies of phasic detrusor contractions compared with those patients with normal upper tracts. The high pressures seen at the end of a medium fill CMG were not found during AM and therefore are unlikely to be the underlying explanation of upper tract dilatation in such patients.\r"

The validity of the procedure was assessed by measuring evaporation loss from the pads and comparing the home with the standard hospital test. Evaporation loss was shown to be acceptable if the test was carried out within 72 h of weighing. There were no significant differences between home and hospital tests and 95% of home results were within 32% below to 16% above hospital results. This was at least as consistent as the \"gold standard\" hospital test as 95% of the hospital results were within 28% below to 44% above repeated test results. The principal advantages in performing the pad test at home are simplicity, cost effectiveness and the relaxed environment, which reproduces more accurately the conditions leading to incontinence when compared with the relatively unfamiliar hospital setting.\r"

The decreased E2 excretion in the PC patients is in accordance with our previous finding concerning significantly lower E2 plasma levels in PC patients. It seems possible that elderly men with lower endogenous oestrogen levels are at higher risk of developing cancer.

Cavernography confirmed that the main venous drainage of the corpora cavernosa is via the cavernous veins, with additional drainage through the crural, circumflex and deep dorsal veins and demonstrated that, in patients with venogenic impotence, the cavernous veins are the common site of leakage. Cavernometry provided valuable parameters for the quantification of the degree of venous leakage. Detailed knowledge of the penile venous system and cavernometry and cavernography are essential for the proper diagnosis and treatment of patients with venogenic impotence.\r"

In the beginning of the study period, DCIS was treated by mastectomy without axillary clearance but sector resection has been performed increasingly. Since 1982 the latter procedure has become standard treatment. Radical resection was confirmed by specimen X-ray and histopathological examination of whole organ sections. No postoperative radiotherapy was given. Twenty-eight women had mastectomy and 38 had sector resection. The median follow-up times were 77 and 60 months respectively. In the mastectomy group postoperative monitoring did not reveal any local recurrence but one contralateral new invasive cancer was discovered. In the sector resection group five recurrences were found. Three of the latter were new cases of DCIS and two appeared as small invasive cancers (stage I). Mastectomy will cure ductal cancer in situ but has a greater morbidity. Sector resection has been established as the method of choice in stage I invasive cancer and is probably also safe in DCIS. The possible beneficial effect of postoperative local radiotherapy after sector resection for DCIS is currently being analysed in a randomized trial which started in Sweden in 1987.\r"

Sixty-nine interpositions were for long-gap oesophageal atresia, while the remainder followed oesophagectomies, eight for strictures and two others. Overall, the transthoracic route was used in 69 per cent of cases, while 29 per cent were retrosternally placed and one was retropleural. The mean follow-up was 11.08 years. The mortality rate was 12 per cent, with one-third of deaths unrelated to the operation. Graft failure, which occurred on eight occasions (10 per cent), was due to ischaemia in four, intractable stricture in two and stomal ulceration in two. Leakage from the proximal anastomosis occurred in 31 per cent of cases and stricture formation in 27 per cent. Thirty per cent of patients complained of acid reflux, of whom one-third developed stomal ulceration. We present data concerning other complications, including long-term recurrent respiratory infections, malabsorption, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, diarrhoea, intestinal obstruction and redundancy of the graft. Staging the procedure did not affect the outcome, however the higher incidence of serious complications encountered following retrosternal interposition finally led us to abandon this procedure in favour of the transthoracic route. There has been little improvement in the growth rate, but in terms of swallowing ability the outcome was satisfactory in 94 per cent of cases.\r"

The patients' average age was 73 years; 78 per cent were 70 years or older at the time of operation. The decision to perform cholecystostomy was taken before the operation which was performed as an emergency procedure for patients considered to be at high risk for cholecystectomy. Forty-six patients (77 per cent) had severe concomitant diseases, and 42 per cent of them had two or more associated diseases simultaneously. The cardiac risk index was high in most patients (90 per cent). Fifty-two patients recovered promptly after surgery. Five patients (8 per cent) developed significant postoperative complications. Three other patients (5 per cent) died of cardiovascular complications. Forty-two patients (70 per cent) underwent an elective cholecystectomy 6-8 weeks later with no further morbidity or mortality. Eleven patients who were at high risk had no further surgery. No residual stones were found in these patients and no relapse of the disease was recorded in the long term follow-up. Four patients were lost to follow-up. We conclude that cholecystostomy may still be used as an initial life saving procedure for critically ill patients with acute cholecystitis, and serves as a definitive procedure for patients considered to be at very high operative risk and who have no residual stones.\r"

Four cases of injury to the duct of Luschka during cholecystectomy are described and illustrated with cholangiographic and histological evidence. Post-cholecystectomy bile leaks from the drain tube, which closed spontaneously without sequelae, were noted in 9 per cent of 204 randomly selected cases and were regarded, at least in some, as being caused by a divided duct of Luschka. The practical significance of this duct during cholecystectomy is to keep close to the gallbladder wall during removal of the gallbladder, and to ligate a divided bile duct of Luschka if recognized at surgery.\r"

Compared with parenchyma, tumour vascularity was classified as hot (18 cases), cold (12 cases), and mixed (12 cases) using 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin (MAA) hepatic arterial scans. The proportion of patients showing complete and partial responses to treatment was higher in the hot group (56 per cent) than in the combined cold and mixed group (12 per cent). In 15 cases (six hot, six cold and three mixed lesions), additional MAA scans were performed immediately after arterial embolization with degradable starch microspheres (DSMs). Either complete or partial reversal of tumour vascularity was observed after DSM-embolization in five and seven cases respectively, two and two of them respectively showing native cold lesions. As tumour vascularity appears to be a prominent prognostic factor, DSM-embolization should improve the efficacy of treatment by improving liver extraction of drugs and causing flow redistribution towards hypovascular areas.\r"

Six patients died in the postoperative period and seven patients developed major postoperative complications (bronchopneumonia, two; wound infection, four; myocardial infarction, one). The preoperative grip strength, measured in kilograms, of the patients who died after major vascular surgery was not significantly lower than that of patients who had an uncomplicated postoperative course. Of the 55 surviving patients, seven developed complications after surgery. These patients had significantly reduced grip strength, expressed as a percentage of the individual preoperative value (P less than 0.05), from the first to the seventh postoperative day when compared with patients without complications. The delayed recovery of grip strength preceded the clinical manifestation of complications. These data suggest that delayed recovery of voluntary muscle performance may be used to detect patients developing postoperative complications and so allow their early treatment.\r"

A triple-lumen catheter was positioned to record from the sphincter of Oddi and duodenum. The sphincter of Oddi was characterized by phasic contractions independent of duodenal contractions. During fasting duodenal wave frequency exhibited four phases, whereas only two phases could be identified from the sphincter of Oddi. A prolonged phase A in the sphincter of Oddi corresponded to duodenal phases I, II and IV. A short phase B in the sphincter of Oddi just preceded the onset of duodenal phase III and was temporally related to it. Sphincter of Oddi basal pressure increased during duodenal phases III and IV. After ingestion of food, sphincter of Oddi basal pressure, wave amplitude and duration decreased, but the frequency remained unchanged. Conversely, duodenal frequency increased but there was no change in amplitude. Thus, the human sphincter of Oddi and duodenum exhibited independent motility demonstrating distinct phases during the interdigestive period. After food, sphincter of Oddi motility altered in a manner which would facilitate the passive flow of fluid into the duodenum.\r"

The two groups (25 patients each) were comparable with regard to size of the oesophageal varices, and the aetiology and severity of the liver disease. Twenty-five patients, 13 and 12 in the thrombin + and - groups, respectively, had at least one episode of variceal bleeding. The remaining 25 were given prophylactic injections. There was a significantly lower rate of occurrence of bleeding from injection sites when the injection needle was removed at the initial session of sclerotherapy in the thrombin + group, where human thrombin was injected (0.2-0.3 ml, 100-150 units per injection) just before removal of the injection needle. Endoscopy at 1 week after the initial session showed a significantly (P less than 0.05) higher rate of disappearance of red colour signs on varices in the thrombin + group (96 per cent) than in the thrombin - group (72 per cent). Fibrin degradation product E-fraction (FDP-E) values increased 1 h, 1 day and 6 days after the initial session of sclerotherapy in the two groups. The rate of increase in FDP-E values 1 h after sclerotherapy was significantly larger (P less than 0.001) in the thrombin + than in the thrombin - group. There was no clinical sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation. Administration of human thrombin plus a sclerosant seems to be useful and efficacious, especially for patients with huge oesophageal varices.\r"

Seventy-nine patients presented with clinical evidence of hernia strangulation which required urgent surgery during the period 1979-87. Forty-six patients (58 per cent) had noted a hernia present for at least 1 month before strangulation: 18 (23 per cent) had not reported it to their family doctor, 19 (24 per cent) were known by family practitioners or non-surgical medical personnel to have a hernia but had not been referred for surgical opinion, and nine (11 per cent) had been previously assessed surgically with a view to elective repair. Of these nine, five were considered unfit, three were on waiting lists for operation and one had refused surgery. Thirty-two patients (40 per cent) presented primarily with strangulation within days of developing a hernia. The duration of hernia before strangulation in one patient was unknown. Although an unavoidable number of patients will continue to present with strangulation within days of developing a hernia, the overall incidence could be significantly reduced by greater public awareness of the risks of hernia strangulation and by a policy of immediate patient referral and prompt elective repair.\r"

Follow-up studies at 6 weeks showed no difference between those graded as mild and those graded as severe at the time of attack. In the patients with elevated activity, nine had this at the time of admission and all were raised within 24 h. Elevated activity correlated well with the clinical outcome and showed good agreement with the multiple prognostic criteria in the prediction of severe disease.

None of the 66 patients with an APACHE II score less than 11 died, while the mortality rate in those scored greater than 10 was 22 per cent. In patients scored greater than 10 non-resective procedures carried less risk of mortality than gastrectomy. The APACHE II score is useful when measuring the severity of the acute disease and predicting the outcome in these patients. If used in daily practice it may assist the surgeon in stratifying patients into a low-risk group (score less than 11) in which major operations are well tolerated and outcome is favourable and a high-risk group (score greater than 10) in which the risk of mortality is high and the performance of procedures of lesser magnitude is probably more likely to improve survival.\r"

Healing was uncomplicated in only three patients (13 per cent). Eleven developed an anal discharge and nine an infected pelvic haematoma despite peranal drainage. Fourteen patients developed pelvic sepsis and, despite surgical curettage in 11, none healed. Six of these patients have had the anal sphincter divided, with healing in only one, and the anal canal has been excised in two. Eleven patients have ultimately healed at a median time of 28 months and eight have persistent sepsis after a median period of 45 months. Two patients with sepsis have had a successful ileoanal anastomosis. Conservative proctocolectomy cannot be recommended as a definitive operation for ulcerative colitis even though it may permit a subsequent restorative procedure.\r"

There were nine failures requiring intubation, ileostomy or pouch excision. There was a significant association between failure and pelvic sepsis (P less than 0.05, n = 8), endoanal mucosectomy (P less than 0.05, n = 7), preservation of a long rectal cuff (P less than 0.05, n = 5) and lack of experience with the operation (P less than 0.05, n = 8). Of 49 patients with preoperative evidence of ulcerative colitis, three are now known to have Crohn's disease. Functional outcome was significantly impaired in patients who developed pelvic sepsis (P less than 0.01) or a postoperative fistula (P less than 0.05), and who had an endoanal mucosectomy (P less than 0.05). Success with ileoanal pouch reconstruction increases with experience. Avoidance of sepsis is associated with a lower failure rate, improved functional results and reduced hospital stay. Preliminary colectomy is also advised to exclude Crohn's disease if the diagnosis is in question.\r"

The following postoperative life-threatening complications occurred: myocardial infarction (14 per cent of the postoperative deaths) during the first three postoperative days; bronchopneumonia (27 per cent of the postoperative deaths) mainly during the first postoperative week; pulmonary embolism (17 per cent of the postoperative deaths) mainly during the second postoperative week; anastomotic leakage and cerebrovascular accident (14 and 8 per cent of the postoperative deaths respectively) mainly during the third and fourth postoperative weeks. Specific risk factors were chronic obstructive airways disease associated with a higher incidence of postoperative bronchopneumonia, and previous myocardial infarction associated with postoperative myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism. General risk factors were old age and emergency procedure, both of which were associated with a higher incidence of infectious complications. The operative mortality rate fell from 20.1 per cent in the 1973-79 period to 7.8 per cent in the 1980-86 period.\r"

The results were compared with videourodynamic studies and multiport anorectal manometry combined with external anal sphincter electromyography. The neurophysiological assessment consisted of electrical stimulation of the dorsogenital nerve, while recording any evoked reflex activity in the external anal and urethral sphincters with concentric needle and surface electrodes. Of these constipated women, 75 per cent had absence of one or more evoked sacral reflexes (compared with 20 per cent of healthy controls, P less than 0.05). Sensory thresholds and motor unit potentials in the external anal sphincter were similar in healthy and constipated women. Nine (56 per cent) constipated women displayed urodynamic abnormalities (increased bladder capacity, acontractile bladder and genuine stress incontinence). Only 38 per cent of constipated women perceived a desire to defaecate during rectal distension with up to 100 ml, compared with 95 per cent of normal subjects (P less than 0.0005). Moreover, 73 per cent of constipated women did not relax the external anal sphincter during defaecation, compared with 12 per cent of controls (P = 0.001). Taking into account the possible significance of our data in relation to previous findings it is suggested that the integration of sensory information within the sacral cord may be impaired in chronic idiopathic constipation.\r"

Bursting pressures were significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in the group with bowel preparation. Anastomotic defects were present in 13 per cent of animals with bowel preparation and 47 per cent without bowel preparation (P = 0.057). Pelvic abscess and death from peritonitis occurred in 6 per cent of the group with bowel preparation and 29 per cent of the unprepared group.

Of these 42, 26 (61.9%) had symptoms; slight dysphagia or chest discomfort was the most common symptom. The remaining 16 (38.1%) had no subjective symptoms. Endoscopic examination proved to be more useful than barium studies. Lugol-combined endoscopy was most effective in detecting the presence and spread of small malignant lesions of the esophagus. At the time of surgery, six patients with submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus had lymph node metastasis, and five died of recurrence. Described herein are the diagnostic features, clinicopathologic characteristics, and long-term results of these 42 patients with early stage, and 328 patients with advanced, carcinomas of the esophagus, detected and surgically treated in our clinics.\r"

To study the effect of low anterior resection on the anal sphincter mechanism, anal manometry was performed on 20 patients before and 10 days after resection. Fifteen patients were studied again 6 months after operation. Resting, maximum squeeze and squeeze increment pressures were recorded. Intraoperative manometry (n = 11) and presacral nerve stimulation (n = 6) were performed to determine whether peroperative injury to the internal anal sphincter had occurred. Resting and maximum squeeze anal canal pressures were reduced by low anterior resection, and did not recover. The squeeze pressure increment did not change. Division of the inferior mesenteric artery, full mobilization of the rectum and mesorectum, and rectal transection did not affect resting anal pressure, which was reduced after EEA anastomosis (mean (s.e.m.) before, 40(5) mmHg; after, 27(4) mmHg; P less than 0.05, n = 5). Presacral nerve stimulation produced relaxation of the internal sphincter. Anal sphincter pressures are reduced after low anterior resection. The external anal sphincter and the nerve supply to the internal anal sphincter appear intact. A direct injury to the internal sphincter is postulated.\r"

Samples were established in organ culture and, after 16 h, crypt cell production rate (CCPR) was determined by a stathmokinetic technique. Crypt morphometry was also undertaken. CCPR in defunctioned large bowel was less than half that of controls: (mean (s.d.)-1.96 (0.68) versus 4.65 (0.54) cells crypt-1 h-1, P less than 0.0001). Likewise, crypt length was 24 per cent lower (0.34 (0.05) versus 0.44 (0.04) mm, P less than 0.0001) and crypt width was 38 per cent lower (0.04 (0.01) versus 0.07 (0.01) mm, P less than 0.0001).

In ileal anastomoses, significant differences between control and germ-free rats were only found at 7 days. Here, the increase in hydroxyproline concentration observed in control rats was significantly reduced in germ-free rats. These data are taken to support the hypothesis that bacteria affect colonic anastomotic healing by contributing to postoperative collagen degradation.\r"

Crude and cancer-specific survival rates of 123 patients treated 5 or more years previously were 58 and 64 per cent. These rates for patients undergoing total anorectal excision were 62 and 65 per cent, and local excision 87 and 100 per cent. Eighty-three patients had carcinoma of the anal margin. Of these, 55 were treated by local excision, 18 by total anorectal excision and 20 by radiotherapy. Eight patients were inoperable. Crude and cancer-specific survival rates for 72 patients followed for 5 years were 55 and 57 per cent with respective rates of 65 and 69 per cent after local excision and 36 and 40 per cent after total anorectal excision. The 5-year survival rate of 27 patients with TNM N1 stage was 48 per cent.

Metachronous lymphadenopathy occurred in 25 patients. The 5-year survival rate in the 23 cases that were histologically confirmed was 35 per cent after block dissection (17 cases) and radiotherapy (four cases). Using a modification of Papillon's T classification for anal canal carcinoma, stage correlated with survival after combining T1 with T2 tumours and T2 with T3 tumours. Five-year survival rates in these groups were 60 and 54 per cent respectively. The TN M-UICC classification for anal margin carcinoma correlated with survival in a similar manner. The 5-year survival rate was 65 per cent for patients with T1 and T2 tumours and 33 per cent for those with T3 and T4 tumours.\r"

Nine patients (22 per cent) proved to have other pathology. Multiple operations were required in eight of 17 patients (47 per cent) who had infected thyroglossal cysts but in only one of 14 (7 per cent) with uninfected cysts. In the infected group preliminary incision and drainage was necessary in five cases and cyst recurrence occurred in four (24 per cent), whereas in the uninfected group there was only one recurrence (7 per cent) in a patient with double pathology. Infection and recurrent cysts were the chief reasons for multiple operations. Recurrence was caused by inadequate performance of the correct operation (Sistrunk's) or choice of the wrong operation. Two of our own three recurrences were due to the latter, other pathology being suspected intraoperatively. Histological study of the specimens showed that thyroglossal ducts were frequently multiple and widely spaced. In children any lesion whose presentation is typical of a thyroglossal cyst should be treated with an early Sistrunk's operation. The operation in children who have other pathology has no complications and is justified.\r"

Diagnosis of intussusception was delayed considerably, probably due to an unusual presentation. Compared with acute intussusception, symptoms consist of infrequent attacks of abdominal pain, sporadic vomiting and no, or small, changes in defecation. Marked weight loss and an abdominal mass assume diagnostic significance, in contradiction to bloody stools. Ultrasonography can be of diagnostic value. An attempt at hydrostatic reduction is often unsuccessful. A high frequency of organic lesions precipitating intussusception warrants early surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA ploidy of breast cancer tissue from paraffin blocks was measured by flow cytometry in 117 patients whose disease had been detected and treated with surgery between 1974 and 1976. Patients with aneuploid tumours had positive axillary nodes and distant metastases more often than those with diploid tumours. Aneuploid tumours were more common in postmenopausal than premenopausal women. The S-phase fraction (SPF) was significantly higher in aneuploid than in diploid tumours and positive axillary lymph nodes were found in 26 per cent of the patients who had a tumour with a SPF below the median (4.8 per cent) and in 48 per cent of those with tumours with SPF values above the median. At the primary clinical investigation 2 per cent of the patients with diploid tumours and 6 per cent of those with aneuploid tumours had distant metastases. During the follow-up, the proportion of patients with distant metastases increased to 42 and 72 per cent, respectively. With a follow-up of 11.5 years, the DNA aneuploidy of the tumour showed a significant association with decreased survival. Thirty-three per cent of patients with diploid and 65 per cent of patients with aneuploid tumours had died from breast cancer during the follow-up (P less than 0.001). All patients with hypertetraploid or multiploid tumours died from breast cancer. High SPF values were associated more closely with distant metastases or death during the follow-up than low SPF values. Our results suggest that DNA ploidy measured by flow cytometry from paraffin embedded tissue blocks of human breast cancer can be used to predict the aggressiveness of the tumour and the survival of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing interest in the potential role of monoclonal antibodies as tumour markers in the early detection of metastatic disease. CA15-3 is a circulating antigen which is relatively specific for breast tissue and defined by two monoclonal antibodies. It is elevated in the serum of patients with breast cancer but its relationship to clinical stage and tumour progression has not been well defined. CA15-3 levels have been measured in a consecutive series of 97 patients with breast cancer at the time of diagnosis and at 3-monthly intervals thereafter. All patients have been evaluated and followed by using routine biochemical and radiological parameters to detect occult metastatic disease. There was no difference between a control group of patients who presented with benign disease (n = 18: means(s.d.) 18.0(5.1) units/ml): and those who presented with stage I disease (n = 37: 18.4(5.3) units/ml) or stage II disease (n =21: 18.0(4.0) units/ml). Patients with stage III disease (n = 23: 32.0(10.4) units/ml) had significantly elevated levels of CA15-3 compared with those in stage I (P less than 0.001). All patients with documented metastatic disease at presentation or at follow-up had markedly elevated CA15-3 levels (n = 10: 155.8(50.2) units/ml). CA15-3 is a reliable tumour marker in patients with advanced disease.\r"

  ".W": "The Stockholm breast cancer screening trial used single-view mammography as the sole screening method. A majority (63 per cent) of the mammographic selected cases from the first two screening rounds had uncertain mammograms, coded as 3 on an ordinal scale from 1 to 5, where 1 and 2 are dismissed as normal mammograms and 5 stands for a typical cancer. In this group of uncertain mammograms 30 cases were malignant and 431 were non-malignant. The aim of this study was to examine whether surgical biopsy in this group could be replaced by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, combined with the information from the mammogram and clinical examination, and whether this diagnostic strategy could select the malignant cases with a high sensitivity. FNA biopsy selected 25 of the 30 mammary carcinomas as definite malignancy or atypia, with a sensitivity of 83 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 69-96 per cent), and combined with the information from the mammogram and clinical examination 29 of the malignancies were selected with a sensitivity of 97 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval: 83-100 per cent). In 398 of 431 non-malignant cases the diagnosis was established with the triple diagnostic approach without needing a surgical biopsy. In a clinical follow-up study, up to 64 months after the first screening round, only one false negative case was found, included in the group of 30 malignancies described above. With this strategy the rate of negative surgical biopsies was reduced by 90 per cent in the group with uncertain mammograms and without considerably impairing the reliability of the results.\r"

The study provides convincing morphological evidence that one of the earliest changes in acute pancreatitis is distortion of the capillary circulation.\r"

Clearance of the duct by basket or balloon extraction was attempted in 97 patients (80 per cent) and achieved in 93 of these patients (96 per cent). In 24 patients the duct was left to empty spontaneously and this occurred in 22 patients. Immediate complications due to endoscopic sphincterotomy occurred in five patients (two haemorrhage, two perforation, one haemorrhage and perforation). Of the 101 patients reviewed 12-72 months (median 24 months) after endoscopic sphincterotomy, 76 (75 per cent) have remained asymptomatic throughout the follow-up period. Eighteen patients (18 per cent) required cholecystectomy for recurrent gallbladder symptoms 1-24 months after endoscopic sphincterotomy. One of the asymptomatic patients underwent cholecystectomy on the advice of his consultant. A further seven had recurrent biliary colic or cholangitis necessitating enlargement of the sphincterotomy and further stone retrieval in three of these patients. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is an effective treatment for bile duct stones in high risk patients, but subsequent cholecystectomy is required in a significant number of patients owing to continuing gallbladder symptoms.\r"

Perfusion of the pancreatic duct with 15 mM glycodeoxycholic acid, ethanol administration, or secretagogue-stimulated pancreatic secretion against greater than 50 per cent duct obstruction resulted in an increase in peak pancreatic duct pressure in all animals. Duct permeability to 20,000 molecular weight dextran molecules was increased in 22 of 29 experimental animals compared with two of 22 control animals (P less than 0.01). Perfusion of the pancreatic duct with activated pancreatic enzymes resulted in acute pancreatitis in 24 of 29 experimental animals compared with three of 22 control animals (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that pancreatic ductal hypertension, resulting in increased ductal permeability to large molecules, may be a common early event in gallstone and alcoholic pancreatitis.\r"

Twenty-five patients with this complication are described; 15 had major bleeding, nine had minor bleeding and one patient had a pseudoaneurysm identified at operation. Of the 15 patients with major bleeding, six presented with this complication and in nine cases it followed pancreatic resection. Of the six patients who presented with major bleeding, five underwent resection with one death while the patient managed conservatively died. The nine patients who had major bleeding after pancreatic resection were managed by ligation of the bleeding artery in six cases with one death, and one patient who rebled after ligation of the bleeding artery was successfully managed by further resection. Three patients with postresection major bleeding were managed conservatively with one death. All minor haemorrhages were managed conservatively without mortality. Deaths after major bleeding were a result of sepsis in three cases and respiratory failure in one. The severity of the underlying pancreatitis was an important factor in two patients. Pseudocysts and pancreatic fistulae were important underlying factors leading to the complication. It is recommended that patients with sepsis, a pancreatic fistula or severe underlying pancreatitis should have their haemorrhage treated by pancreatic resection, while those patients with bleeding following pancreatic resection without such complications can be managed by ligation.\r"

  ".W": "We report a well tolerated endoscopic technique of administering intraluminal radiotherapy to 14 patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma, in which the iridium-192 wire source was inserted down a nasobiliary catheter placed within a previously inserted endoscopic biliary prosthesis, thus allowing bile flow to continue during treatment. Radiotherapy was commenced 2 weeks after biliary decompression, when the median serum bilirubin level had fallen from 213 to 34 mumol/l. A total radiation dose of 6000 cGy at 0.5 cm from the source was administered over a median of 85 h (range 77-116 h). In four patients there was a transient increase in serum bilirubin during iridium treatment and, in two cases (14 per cent), this was associated with mild cholangitis. Both cases resolved rapidly once the iridium wire and nasobiliary catheter were removed. The median hospital stay after treatment was 2.5 days (range 0-28 days). The late complications associated with stent blockage were minimized by routinely changing stents at 4-6 monthly intervals; ten of the patients have so far undergone from one to five (median three) stent changes. Five patients have died at 3.6-8.2 months (median 4.8 months) following iridium treatment; four had extensive type III hilar lesions at diagnosis. Nine patients are still alive at 5.4-31.0 months (median 16.4 months). The overall median survival after iridium therapy is 10.5 months. This technique of endoscopic biliary decompression before internal iridium administration minimizes complications by allowing biliary drainage during treatment. The role of this treatment in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma awaits the results of randomized, controlled trials.\r"

Twenty-three eyes were studied with an Octopus perimeter, with a technician monitoring eye movements. The sensitivity was 100% and the specificity 23%. The low specificity was due to the technician's inability to accurately monitor small eye movements in the central 6 degrees field. If small eye movements are monitored accurately with an eye tracker, eye movement perimetry could become an alternative method to standard perimetry.\r"

The prevalence of peripapillary crescents was lower among hyperopes than among myopes (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the ocular hypertensive subjects had a statistically significant tendency toward a hyperopic median refraction (p less than 0.01). In keeping with this, we observed a lower prevalence rate of crescents in the ocular hypertensive group (35%) than among the healthy subjects (41%). This difference is in the expected direction and magnitude if the absence of a crescent decreases the risk of glaucomatous damage from elevated intraocular pressure, but the number of subjects was too small to obtain statistical significance; however, the evidence is suggestive. Further study, such as in a large population survey or by comparison of two groups with matched genetic heritage, is needed to substantiate the relation between the presence of a crescent and increased risk of glaucomatous damage.\r"

Subjects were selected at random from the telephone directory and were interviewed on the telephone with a prepared questionnaire. Most of the respondents were aware of the value and types of organ and tissue transplantation. Although 63% expressed a willingness to donate body parts, only 37% had signed the organ donation portion of their driver's licence or an organ donor card. The respondents who were unwilling to donate body parts expressed certain deep-rooted anxieties and fears. More public education is needed to allay the fears and misunderstandings that remain in the minds of many potential donors.\r"

  ".U": "89354085\r", 
  ".W": "As part of the Federal/Provincial/Territorial Review on Liability and Compensation Issues in Health Care, in 1988 we surveyed Canadian general practitioners and family physicians to determine the effect of liability concerns on their practices in the previous 5 years. Questionnaires were sent to a random, stratified national sample of 1295 physicians, with a response rate of 64.6%. However, a high proportion of the returned questionnaires were ineligible because the physicians were not in general or family practice, were not involved in direct patient care, or had died or moved; thus, the corrected response rate was 50.8%. The newsletter of the Canadian Medical Protective Association was the source of information on liability most frequently cited (by 88.1% of the physicians) and most influential (to 62.4%). Only 15.5% of the physicians cited personal involvement with medicolegal issues as a source of information; the rate was higher for Ontario physicians and those in urban areas generally. A total of 74.6% of the respondents had altered their style of practice in the previous 5 years, and 56.3% reported changes in the scope of their practice. Concern about litigation was the most important reason for changing style of practice and reducing or eliminating administration of anesthesia, whereas lifestyle and other issues along with liability concerns most influenced decisions to reduce obstetric care and emergency department work. Our findings suggest that physicians' perceptions of liability issues have had a profound influence on primary care practice in Canada in the past several years.\r"

The results indicated that the participants had well-formulated concepts of exemplary practitioners, defining five main categories of performance: clinical competence, relationship with patients, availability, family physician-consultant relationship and a fifth category that included organizational ability and personality attributes. The family physicians and the consultants placed different values on these categories and indicated that these values might change under different clinical circumstances. Their concepts appear to be compatible with, but not restricted to, a model of contemporary medical practice based on an ethic specific to medicine.\r"

When disagreements arise between a patient and family members caregivers sometimes find themselves caught in a complex tangle of human relationships that strains monochrome ethical thinking. The patient's expressed wishes are often compromised for the sake of the family's needs. Conversely, a unilateral appeal for patient autonomy may prove insensitive to the hurt and the needs of the family. We describe a relatively unsuccessful attempt by a patient's caregivers to buy time to maximize the interests of the patient and her family and discuss the way in which the family dynamics militated against the rather obvious solution of promoting the patient's right to refuse treatment. The purpose of this article is not to evoke sympathy for health care professionals in dealing with such conflicts but rather to heighten awareness of the issues at stake and to stimulate thinking about ways and means to bring about a more favourable outcome than the one described here.\r"

Recent provincial legislation requiring the generic substitution of interchangeable products and the nondisclosure of all ingredients in product labelling hinder the search for an excipient that has caused an adverse reaction. Practitioner participation in the Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Registry of the Canadian Dermatology Association will identify sensitizing excipients and will support efforts by the profession to obtain more effective and safer products.\r"

  ".W": "We carried out two studies to determine the effects of feedback on subsequent blood pressure and heart rate readings in subjects without significant cardiovascular abnormalities. In both studies the subjects were randomly assigned to be told that their blood pressure was normal or was high or to receive no feedback at all; 3 minutes later another reading was taken and correct feedback provided. Study 1 was done in 114 patients who attended a family practice teaching unit for an office visit; subjects taking cardioactive medication or with chronically elevated blood pressure (diastolic pressure more than 95 mm Hg) or known low pressure (diastolic pressure less than 60 mm Hg) were excluded. Half of the subjects received feedback from a nurse and the other half from a physician. We found no effect of type of feedback or type of practitioner on subsequent readings. No adaptation of diastolic blood pressure or heart rate took place, whereas a similar rest period in the laboratory consistently triggers cardiovascular adaptation. Given the field nature of the study it was not clear whether the intervention was not powerful or whether the practitioner-patient interactions diffused the effects of an otherwise powerful intervention. Therefore, a second study with the same design was carried out in a controlled laboratory setting with 61 university students who believed they were in the adaptation phase of an experimental stress protocol. The subjects did not interact with the experimenter, who provided only the initial feedback, via intercom. The findings replicated those of study 1: type of feedback had no significant effect on subsequent blood pressure levels, and all types of feedback prevented cardiovascular adaptation. We recommend that patients be allowed to rest alone for at least 10 minutes before blood pressure is measured. Our findings suggest that practitioners need not be concerned about telling normotensive or borderline hypertensive patients that their blood pressure is elevated.\r"

The patients with Parkinson's disease had clinical and epidemiologic characteristics similar to those of patients in previous, mainly hospital-based, studies. These characteristics included mean age at onset (63 years), frequency rate of dementia (20%) and presence of postural tremor (11%). The pattern of treatment varied, some patients receiving more medication than is usual for the severity of their illness, and some patients receiving less than is usual. Parkinson's disease can be difficult to diagnose and manage because of the clinical variation between patients in presentation and response to treatment.\r"

A total of 1429 (98.4%) of all patients diagnosed during a 25-year to 30-year period and reported to the Nordic cancer registries were available for follow-up through 1982. The relative survival rate was lower in older patients; the relative excess risk of dying (from breast cancer) during the first 5 years of observation, calculated by multiple regression modelling, increased in a regular fashion more than three-fold from patients younger than 40 years at diagnosis to those aged 80 years or older. Significantly lower rates were found among males in Denmark and Finland, the relative excess risks of dying (compared with Sweden) being 1.39 (1.06-1.80) and 1.73 (1.22-2.45), respectively, during the first 5 years. The authors concluded first that important differences exist between male and female patients with breast cancer in the relation between survival and age at diagnosis, and secondly that a later stage at presentation or national differences in the natural history are the most likely explanations for the worse prognosis in Denmark and Finland.\r"

Two patients had Stage IA, one Stage IIC, and two Stage IIIA disease. Initial therapy consisted of unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in two cases and total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in three cases. Three patients remained clinically free of disease after six courses of VPCBAE and the two patients who had measurable pelvic disease before the administration of chemotherapy had objective responses. Four patients died of disease from 11 to 18 months after initial laparotomy. One patient is alive and disease-free at 29 months. The VPCBAE combination appears to be effective in select cases of SCCO. A study of the efficacy of VPCBAE in a larger group of patients with SCCO seems to be indicated.\r"

However, neither the TLI nor the PDP-LI was a predictor of survival. A higher response rate was observed in the case of rapidly proliferating tumors: an objective response (OR) was observed in 38.4% of the patients with a low TLI and in 53.6% of the patients with a high TLI. The advantage of an OR in favor of the high TLI group was significant for patients treated with regimens containing doxorubicin (high TLI, 72.2% OR; low TLI, 40% OR; P = 0.03).\r"

Using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) criteria, two patients had a complete remission, one of which has lasted for 30 months, four patients have had partial remissions, one patient has had a mixed response, and one patient who has been treated for only 4 weeks, a minimal response. Toxicity has been minor and transient. Chemotherapy appears to be an acceptable alternative to radical surgery in selected patients with desmoid tumors.\r"

Tumor thickness, tumor size, and perineural invasion all have an impact on survival and must be considered in treatment plans. Tumors measuring between 2 mm and 3 mm may or may not have metastases and further evaluation of this group needs to be done. Most importantly, the data in this study supports a multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of pathology specimens. Precise guidelines must be established for handling of the specimen, which must then be evaluated for the variables mentioned above. In this way, more definitive conclusions can be reached in the management of tumors of the anterior tongue and floor of mouth.\r"

Only three patients underwent primary mastectomy (Stage III), and the remainder were treated either by wide local excision and postoperative radiotherapy (357 cases) or by needle biopsy and primary irradiation (51 cases). A total of seven of 356 (2%) Stage I and II patients have developed uncontrolled local or nodal recurrence at a median follow-up of 5 years, and nine of 55 (16%) of Stage III and IV patients. Of the 62 Stage I and II patients who have died, seven (11%) have died with uncontrolled locoregional disease. Of the 22 Stage III and IV patients who have died, eight (36%) have died with uncontrolled locoregional disease. Although the majority of local recurrences within the conserved breast could be salvaged by secondary surgery (37/38 Stage I and II patients), the development of chest wall or nodal recurrence was usually associated with the appearance of distant metastases and a poor prognosis. Data on uncontrolled local recurrence should be given in all studies of breast cancer treatment, since it represents an important end-point of therapy and a difficult clinical problem.\r"

Traditional management has included therapeutic thoracentesis or the placement of a large bore chest tube for drainage with the subsequent installation of a sclerosing agent in an attempt to achieve pleural symphysis. An evaluation of all patients treated in this manner during a 4-year period was undertaken to assess the degree of success obtained with a large bore standard chest tube versus a small pigtail catheter. A study group consisting of 20 patients with a total of 24 pleural effusions was treated with drainage and sclerotherapy. In this group, eight of 13 effusions were adequately treated with pigtail catheter drainage and sclerotherapy, compared with four of 11 effusions adequately treated with standard chest tube drainage and sclerotherapy. Although the numbers are small, it appears that pigtail catheter drainage and sclerosis is at least as successful as the more traditional drainage with the standard chest tube.\r"

As compared with 33 healthy young adults, no significant immunologic deficit could be identified. On the contrary, the young adult cancer population had significantly increased lymphocyte numbers (P less than 0.05) and serum IgA, IgG, and IgM levels (P less than 0.001, respectively). These young cancer patients cannot be considered to be immunosuppressed. Alternative biologic mechanisms must be defined to account for the increasing incidence of head and neck cancer over the last decade among young adults in the United States.\r"

Six of 36 tumors contained SS receptors, whereas ten of the 36 tumors were shown to contain EGF receptors. None of the tumor samples containing SS receptors were simultaneously EGF receptor positive. In contrast, all SS receptor-positive tumors simultaneously contained steroid receptors. The positive correlation between SS receptors and steroid receptors as well as the negative correlation between SS receptors and EGF receptors therefore suggest that the small percentage of SS receptor-positive breast tumors are a group of differentiated breast tumors with a good prognosis. In these cases, combined hormonetherapy including SS analogs may be of potential interest.\r"

However, the reproducibility of the classification of specific histologic patterns and the interrater agreement on the gradings have not been firmly established. A panel of three independent expert pathologists reviewed histologic sections from 128 patients selected among 1848 with colorectal cancer, diagnosed in 11 hospitals of the same region. The panel agreed with 92.6% of the original diagnoses of colorectal adenocarcinoma. As for agreement between panel members, the kappa value was 0.78 for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and 0.62 for confirmation of colorectal origin. The intraclass correlation coefficient for tumor differentiation features was 0.75. The proportion of villous and adenomatous components also generated good agreement. However, the grading of mucin secretion showed poor agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.44). Results confirm the reliability of routine pathological diagnosis and also demonstrate the reproducibility of basic diagnostic categories and pathognomonic features. Thus, to obtain reliable information from medical records for epidemiologic and clinical studies, data should be limited to well-defined diagnostic and histopathologic categories.\r"

The mean serum DPP IV activity of all cancer patients was significantly (P less than 0.001) decreased, compared with that of healthy subjects. Although there was no significant difference between the stages by International Union Against Cancer (UICC) classification (1978), DPP IV levels tended to change dynamically, reflecting the clinical status during therapies. The serum DPP IV activity of patients with a fair prognosis was significantly elevated toward the normal range, whereas the activity of patients with a poor prognosis was significantly decreased (P less than 0.05). In contrast, the mean serum lys-ala-beta NA hydrolytic activity of cancer patients was significantly (P less than 0.001) increased, compared with that of healthy subjects, and was changed reciprocally to DPP IV activity. The correlation of these two serum enzyme activities with tumor weights also was observed in animal models using nude mice transplanted with human KB carcinoma cells and hamsters transplanted with BHK21 cells. These results indicate that these serum enzyme levels may become an aid for the diagnosis of malignant tumors and for estimating the prognosis of the patients.\r"

  ".W": "In order to clarify the prevalence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) infection in the Kagoshima district, Japan, a highly endemic area for HTLV-I, antibodies for HTLV-I (anti-HTLV-I) were examined in the sera of 6167 from healthy residents and patients with various hematologic and nonhematologic diseases. In healthy residents, including blood donors, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I was 11.9% (562/4741 persons). The prevalence increased with age, and was significantly higher in in females than in males (P less than 0.01). The prevalence of anti-HTLV-I in blood donors was 8.5%. In In hematologic diseases, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I was 98.3% in ATL, 28.9% in lymphoproliferative disorders except ATL, and 10.6% in myeloproliferative disorders. In nonhematologic diseases, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I was shown to be 29.5% in pulmonary tuberculosis, 25.8% in leprosy, 33.8% in chronic renal failure (CRF), 21.9% in autoimmune diseases, and 47.8% in strongyloidiasis. The various diseases except myeloproliferative disorders had significantly higher prevalence of anti-HTLV-I than healthy residents (P less than 0.01 or 0.05). For autoimmune diseases, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I in patients with blood transfusion (55.6%) was higher than in those without blood transfusion (8.7%), and healthy residents. In hemodialysis patients with CRF who had received blood transfusions the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I increased with the number of blood transfusions. Therefore, HTLV-I transmission via blood transfusion would partially explain these high prevalence of anti-HTLV-I. However, the prevalence of anti-HTLV-I in hemodialysis patients with CRF was statistically higher than that in healthy residents, regardless of blood transfusion (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, hemodialysis patients showed significantly higher prevalence of anti-HTLV-I than healthy residents, even at a younger age. Patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and leprosy showed the same results as hemodialysis patients. These results suggest that possibility that HTLV-I infection has some relation not only to ATL but also to other diseases. Therefore, it seems very important to halt the spread of HTLV-I transmission as soon as possible.\r"

These cells were the pale cells of the solid areas, the cells covering the papillary projections, and the cells lining the cleft-like spaces. These cells also were positive for conventional epithelial cell markers. Some cells also were positive for vimentin. Electron microscopic study showed that the predominant cell was a poorly differentiated pneumocyte. Immunoelectron microscopic study also demonstrated that PE-10 existed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of some of the cells in the solid areas, in the same way as normal type II pneumocytes. We concluded that the sclerosing hemangioma is an epithelial tumor with differentiation towards type II pneumocytes.\r"

It has come to be recognized as an aggressive neoplasm with the potential for local recurrence and distant metastasis, despite a seemingly successful total surgical resection. This report documents our experience with an 8-year-old boy who had an 80% hepatectomy for an undifferentiated (embryonal) sarcoma, followed by cisplatin (90 mg/m2), doxorubicin (20 mg/m2/d), and radiation therapy (1950 cGy) to the tumor bed. Residual microscopic tumor was very likely present in the region of the inferior vena cava, but exploratory laparotomies for the purpose of \"second-look\" biopsies were performed with negative results after the completion of each course of chemotherapy. The patient is off of treatment and disease-free 30 months after the diagnosis. Because the survival at this time has been so poor for this highly malignant tumor, we suggest that the combination of therapeutic techniques and second-look laparotomy(s) to identify any subclinical tumor may be a reasonable approach. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies by us and other investigators indicate that the neoplastic cells are primitive mesenchymal cells by electron microscopic study and have immunoreactivity limited to vimentin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin.\r"

Histologic examination showed papillary proliferations of well-differentiated, mucus-secreting cells that occasionally stained for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA 19-9). The proliferations filled the main pancreatic duct, and extended into smaller ducts in some cases. In three patients, the lesions contained foci of pronounced to severe cellular atypia and carcinoma in situ. None of our series or any similar cases reported in the literature has shown invasion into peripancreatic tissue, metastasis, or tumor recurrence after pancreatectomy. Because of their favorable prognosis, intraductal papillary neoplasms should be considered low-grade malignancies that must not be confused with the common ductal adenocarcinoma.\r"

The stroma was characterized by chronic inflammation and often acute inflammation. In most of the cases there was mural proliferation of the mesothelial cells, occasionally simulating a malignant mesothelioma. Twelve lesions were complicated by postoperative local recurrence; in four of these cases the recurrences were multiple; neither the size of the lesion nor the presence of mural mesothelial proliferation influenced the outcome. The clinical and pathologic data in this series suggest that the MPIC is a nonneoplastic reactive mesothelial proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "A multiinstitutional review of 3778 patients with a primary malignancy of the urinary bladder revealed 18 cases (0.48%) of small cell carcinoma which were histologically and morphometrically identical to pulmonary small cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Age, sex, and symptoms at first presentation were comparable to that known in transitional cell carcinoma. Sixteen patients (89%) developed metastatic disease, with most frequent involvement of regional lymph nodes, liver, skeleton, and abdominal cavity. The unfavorable clinical outcome was worse as compared with that reported in advanced stage poorly differentiated transitional cell carcinoma, and was similar to the rapidly fatal outcome of pulmonary small cell undifferentiated carcinoma. Fourteen patients (78%) died by tumor at a mean follow-up period of 9.4 months, and only one patient was free of recurrent disease more than 5 years after cystectomy. This apparent aggressive tumor behavior was independent of the presence of neuroendocrine differentiation characteristics at immunohistochemical (13 cases, 72%) or electron microscopic study (eight cases, 44%). The prolonged survival periods (15-38 months) of the five patients who received combination chemotherapy suggested that, just as in small cell lung carcinoma, chemotherapy may be profitable. A unified concept of histogenesis of bladder cancer with a common origin from a multipotent mucosal stem cell is proposed.\r"

There were seven patients with breast cancer, eight with lung cancer, and ten with a variety of other cancers. Twenty-four patients responded to a single APD 45 mg infusion, 18 of whom (75%) had falls in plasma calcium to below the upper limit of normal (less than or equal to 2.75 mmol/l). Of 15 patients who had severe hypercalcemia, i.e., plasma calcium levels greater than 3.5 mmol/l, 14 responded and 9 (60%) achieved normocalcemia. Five patients developed hypocalcemia. One patient with lung cancer developed spontaneously reversible acute dyspnea after APD which was considered to be an idiosyncratic drug reaction. Single short-duration infusions of APD 45 mg are very effective in correcting malignant hypercalcemia in the majority of patients and are particularly suitable for patients with pre-APD plasma calcium levels greater than 3.5 mmol/l, who are less likely to develop hypocalcemia.\r"

Three infants are described who had thrombocytopenia and the classical criteria of metastatic solid tumor in the bone marrow: patchy infiltration by cohesive clusters of cells with high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio and myelofibrosis in the bone marrow biopsy infiltrated area. This finding prompted clinical evaluation for solid tumor. The megakaryocytic lineage was ascertained by immunocytochemical studies and/or electron microscopic examinations of the bone marrow aspirates. The blasts in all three patients showed cytogenetic abnormalities that also were demonstrated by quantitative DNA analysis. None of the infants had Down's syndrome. Two of the patients are alive; one is off of therapy and the other is in remission. The third patient was transferred to another institution and lost to follow-up. Two children had wheezing that disappeared in remission. It is proposed that the clinical symptoms may be due to a substance produced, stored, or released by the leukemic cells.\r"

The stage at diagnosis was treated as a polytomous response variable in a logit-type, log-linear (Poisson) model, with smoking status, age, sex, and race as covariates. The relative frequency of disseminated colorectal cancer was 45% greater in smokers, compared with nonsmokers (relative risk [RR] = 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 2.09). A substudy was conducted to determine the accuracy of the registry's smoking data; the findings suggest that the actual association may be larger than that presented above. These results confirm the presence of an association between smoking and advanced stage of colorectal cancer at diagnosis.

  ".W": "Patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS) and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction may dramatically improve after aortic valve replacement, but operative risk is high. In an earlier study, all patients with low preoperative wall stress and low ejection fraction, or with low aortic valve gradient, died or had persistent heart failure after operation. Because wall stress is difficult to calculate, we reassessed its effect and the effect of other preoperative characteristics on outcome in 66 consecutive catheterization patients with predominant aortic stenosis referred for valve replacement. Despite ejection fraction that was inordinately low compared with afterloading wall stress in nine patients, seven patients improved with surgery. All three patients with ejection fraction less than 20% improved after surgery. Two of three patients with mean aortic valve gradients of less than 30 mm Hg improved. Mortality was 33% in patients with mean gradient less than 30 mm Hg and 19% with mean gradient less than 50 mm Hg. In the 54 patients with calculated aortic valve areas of less than or equal to 0.8 cm2, 1 (2%) had continuing heart failure, while 6 of 12 (50%, P less than .01) patients with aortic valve areas of 0.9-1.2 cm2 had continued symptoms of or died of heart failure. Patients who died or failed to improve after operation were older (71 +/- 9 years) than those who improved (65 +/- 9 years, P = .02). We conclude that wall stress calculations do not predict which patients with aortic stenosis will benefit from aortic valve replacement and that poor left ventricular function and low mean aortic valve gradient do not absolutely preclude operation. On the other hand, low gradient, non-critical valve area, and advanced age are all relative contraindications to aortic valve replacement in aortic stenosis.\r"

  ".W": "The peak instantaneous aortic valve gradient derived from Doppler echocardiography is commonly used to predict the severity of aortic stenosis. Peak instantaneous gradient should not be equated with the mean gradient or \"peak to peak\" gradient measured at cardiac catheterization. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the relationship between the aortic valve gradients, using a two-catheter transseptal technique in 102 patients with aortic stenosis, mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation, and following aortic valve replacement. These cases were drawn from a series of 111 consecutive transseptal procedures for patients with isolated aortic valve disease. No major complications occurred, and the most common reason for technical failure was inability to engage the atrial septum in postoperative patients. Although the peak instantaneous gradient correlates well with the mean gradient in aortic stenosis (r = .94, P less than .001), mixed stenosis and regurgitation (r = .95, P less than .001), and after aortic valve replacement (r = .86, P less than .001), it systematically overestimates both the mean gradient and the peak to peak gradient. Neither the peak instantaneous nor the mean gradient correlates highly with aortic valve area in aortic stenosis (r = -.48, P less than .01 peak; r = -.58, P less than .001 mean gradient), mixed aortic stenosis and regurgitation (r = -.39, P NS peak; r = -.42, P NS mean gradient) or following aortic valve replacement (r = -.26, P NS peak; r = -.53, P less than .01 mean gradient). Systolic time intervals also were analyzed from the simultaneous left ventricular and ascending aortic pressure tracings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate preoperative right ventricular assessment, we compared the right ventricular size and morphology determined by selective right ventricular catheterization with axial left ventricular angiography. In seven consecutive patients with tricuspid atresia and ventriculo-arterial concordance, the right ventricular volume was 12.8 +/- 9.4 cc, with a predicted normal volume (based on body surface area) of 31 +/- 16 cc, 43% (range 24-78%) of normal. Right ventricular injection outlined a right ventricular area twice that visualized from an axial left ventricular injection (33.2 vs. 16.5 cm). All patients had a well developed but small trabecular portion of the right ventricle, often unopacified with left ventricular injection. Subinfundibular narrowing adjacent to the ventricular septal defect was invariably present, creating, in effect, a two-chambered right ventricle. Selective right ventriculography demonstrates the unique morphology of the right ventricle in patients with tricuspid atresia not visualized by axial left ventriculography.\r"

The ischemia-related vessel was occluded in all cases of sudden death and in three cases of acute myocardial infarction. Reperfusion was achieved in eight vessels: after intracoronary streptokinase in three, after intracoronary nitroglycerin in three, and mechanically in two. Coronary spasm was demonstrated in three vessels, and coronary thrombi, in four. The coronary lesion was described as either concentric in two or eccentric with irregular borders in eight. There was a high incidence of eccentric lesions consistent with ruptured plaques. The acute coronary angiographic findings of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death after sport are similar. Physical exercise can provoke myocardial infarction and sudden death probably by inducing plaque rupture that can evoke coronary spasm, thrombosis, or both.\r"

The flow was improved from TIMI 0 (10 patients, no flow) or TIMI 1 (2 patients, impaired flow) to TIMI 3 (10 patients, normal flow) or TIMI 2 (2 patients, normal but slower flow). A custom-made 8 F Teflon-coated sheath was introduced in the superficial femoral and proximal below-the-knee arteries to aspirate the debris. Distal embolization in below-the-knee arteries was concomitantly treated with short-term intraarterial Urokinase in nine patients. Complications included one in-hospital (not procedure related) death, two patients with below-the-knee amputations (above-the-knee amputation averted), and one transmetatarsal amputation (prior established gangrene present and below-the-knee amputation avoided). The remaining nine patients left the hospital with improved limb status and peripheral pulses. This technique is a rapid, reliable, and efficient method to treat in-situ clot or procedure-related distal embolization as an adjuvant or complement to lytic treatment.\r"

We have therefore developed a technique for PTCA of chronic total coronary occlusions using the ultralow profile \"balloon-on-a-wire\" Probe. An intracoronary Probing Catheter is used to facilitate crossing the stenosis with a guidewire and then to deliver a Probe into the obstruction for balloon dilatation. This technique was used in 13 patients including six in whom other dilating systems had failed to cross the occlusion. Successful dilatation was performed in nine patients (67%). Among the six patients in whom other dilating systems had failed, dilatation was performed in five using the Probing Catheter technique with a successful outcome achieved in four (67%). The Probing Catheter technique offers a promising new method to apply \"balloon-on-a-wire\" technology to the dilatation of chronic total coronary occlusions. This method may allow successful dilatation when other dilating systems fail.\r"

Since primary success of balloon angioplasty in this condition is usually limited by the difficulty of crossing the occlusion, different techniques have been described for this purpose, such as use of stiff guidewires, coronary infusion catheters, guidewires with an olive-shaped tip, or new developing methods (atherectomy, laser), in association with balloon dilatation. Here, we describe our initial experience with a thick (0.035 in) and relatively stiff open-ended guidewire, which has an inner (0.018 in diameter) lumen provided with a core wire. Several advantages are considered. The core wire yields a perfect means of steerability of the whole system, while pushability of a thicker guidewire is much greater. Moreover, the core wire can be removed, and contrast injections beyond the occlusion through the inner lumen can assure proper intraluminal location. Finally, position across the occlusion can be kept easily, since an exchange wire for conventional balloon catheters can be inserted in the inner lumen of the open-ended guidewire.\r"

Although there is evidence that ATP and ADP are inactivated by endothelial ectonucleotidases, there has been little attempt to study the metabolic routes of their catabolism in blood or to assess the contribution of this process to their clearance in vivo. Therefore, we have studied the rates and patterns of catabolism of ATP, ADP, and AMP in whole blood, plasma, and isolated blood cells. Rates of degradation of each nucleotide in cell-free plasma ranged from 0.07-0.32 nmol/min/ml with 1 microM substrates to 1.1-3.6 nmol/min/ml with 100 microM substrates. The pattern of catabolism indicated that sequential dephosphorylation from ATP----ADP----AMP----adenosine occurs. In whole blood, the pattern was similar although ATP and ADP (but not AMP) breakdown was more rapid. This was due to leukocyte ectonucleotidase activity. The use of selective inhibitors demonstrated that catabolism was not due to nonspecific phosphatase activity and that plasma 5'-nucleotidase is distinct from ATPase or ADPase. In leukocytes, ATPase and ADPase activities were distinguishable, and each contributed substantially to the rates of catabolism in whole blood. Leukocyte 5'-nucleotidase did not measurably contribute to AMP dephosphorylation in blood. By comparison, ecto-ATPase and ecto-ADPase activities on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells were similar to those on leukocytes while endothelial 5'-nucleotidase per 10(6) cells was equivalent to the soluble activity in 1 ml of blood or plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Two binding sites for PGE2 were identified in isolated bovine sarcolemmal membranes: a high-affinity site with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.32 nM and a maximum binding (Bmax) of 376 fmol/mg of protein and a lower-affinity site with a Kd of 3.41 nM and a Bmax of 2,112 fmol/mg of protein. In competition experiments, unlabeled PGE1 displaced [3H]PGE2 from its membrane receptor at concentrations similar to those of unlabeled PGE2. Both PGF2 alpha and PGD2 displaced [3H]PGE2 from the membrane, but only at high concentrations (greater than 10(-6) M and greater than 10(-5)M, respectively). Digestion of sarcolemmal membrane with trypsin resulted in a threefold decrease in specific [3H]PGE2 binding. Phosphorylation of the membrane with protein kinase A also decreased specific [3H]PGE2 binding. At concentrations of PGE2 that occupy the high-affinity site, sarcolemmal adenylate cyclase activity was inhibited in the presence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]. We conclude that the isolated cardiac sarcolemmal membrane contains a high-affinity binding site for PGE2 that is functionally coupled to adenylate cyclase. The binding site is stereospecific and probably recognizes the 9-keto,11-hydroxyl portion of the ring structure of these prostaglandins.\r"

We injected salbutamol, a selective beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist, into the right coronary artery to avoid peripheral vasodilator action and to stimulate the sinoatrial node directly. Salbutamol injections caused a sinus tachycardia. The same doses of salbutamol injected into the aortic root caused no change in heart rate, ruling out a systemic effect. The mean dose required to cause an increase in heart rate of 30 beats/min (IHR30) was 2.6 micrograms in the first group of six patients. In 12 other patients salbutamol was given after beta-blockade to confirm the beta 2-selectivity of the responses. Doses of practolol (beta 1-selective blockade) and of propranolol (beta 1- and beta 2-blockade) that had equal beta 1-blocking activity were used. In six patients who were given practolol, the mean IHR30 dose was 2.1 micrograms. In six patients who were given propranolol, the mean IHR30 dose was significantly greater at 64 micrograms (p less than 0.001, practolol vs. propranolol). This study demonstrates that direct cardiac beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation in man has a positive chronotropic effect.\r"

  ".W": "A large reduction of intracellular potassium activity in depolarized subendocardial Purkinje fibers 24 hours after coronary artery ligation is accompanied by a much smaller increase in intracellular sodium activity. Similar intracellular ionic changes also occur during acute ischemia in ventricular muscle and are consistent with mechanisms based on intracellular acidification, which is known to occur in acutely ischemic muscle. To determine if canine subendocardial Purkinje cells 24 hours after myocardial infarction are also acidic, their intracellular pH, surface pH, and maximum diastolic potential (MDP) were measured with double-barrel pH-sensitive microelectrodes and compared with control fibers in noninfarcted hearts. In 12 mM bicarbonate Tyrode's solution (5% CO2-95% O2), the average intracellular pH was not significantly different (p greater than 0.25) for normal tissue (6.83 +/- 0.08, SD, MDP = -83.5 +/- 3.2 mV), for depolarized Purkinje fibers in infarct preparations during the first hour of superfusion (6.88 +/- 0.11, MDP = -47.8 +/- 11.8 mV), and for partially recovered Purkinje fibers in infarcts averaged over the third to sixth hours of superfusion (6.85 +/- 0.12, MDP = -74.5 +/- 9.6 mV). In 24 mM bicarbonate Tyrode's solution, infarct intracellular pH during both the first hour of superfusion (7.08 +/- 0.13, MDP = -57.6 +/- 15.7 mV) and during the third to sixth hours of superfusion (7.06 +/- 0.15, MDP = -76.5 +/- 9.6 mV) was significantly alkaline (p less than 0.0005) compared with average control pH (6.92 +/- 0.12, MDP = 82.1 +/- 3.7 mV). In 24 mM bicarbonate Tyrode's solution, the intracellular pH did vary with MDP (0.0032 pH units/mV). During superfusion of normal Purkinje fibers with hypoxic Tyrode's solution, intracellular pH acidified by 0.22 pH units as they depolarized. Therefore, intracellular acidification does not seem to be a cause of the depolarization of subendocardial Purkinje cells 24 hours after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The threshold pressure of single baroreceptor units is decreased after compared with before exposure to pulsatile pressure according to previous studies in our laboratory. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the determinants of sensitization of arterial baroreceptors by pulsatile pressure. Carotid sinus nerve activity was recorded in dogs anesthetized with chloralose. Two indexes of baroreceptor \"sensitivity\" were obtained by comparing nerve activity before and immediately after exposure of the isolated carotid sinus to pulsatile pressure for periods up to 10 minutes. Sensitization occurred 1) when the threshold pressure of single baroreceptor units determined with a slow nonpulsatile ramp decreased after as compared with before pulsing and 2) when multiple unit activity increased after as compared with before pulsing at various mean levels of static pressure. Sensitization was evident after pulsing at mean pressure of 50 and 100 mm Hg, but not at 150 and 200 mm Hg, and was caused by the pulsatile change in diameter or deformation and not by the pulsatile change in wall tension. The magnitude of the effect was directly related to the duration of the pulsing period and to the frequency and amplitude of the pressure pulses. The sensitization could not be explained by increased diameter (sonomicrometers) or strain of the carotid sinus at the same pressure after pulsing; thus, there was an increase in \"strain sensitivity\" that outlasted the period of pulsing by up to several minutes. In most experiments the shift from static to pulsatile pressure at 50 and 100 mm Hg caused an increase in nerve activity, yet sensitization occurred after pulsing when one would have expected postexcitatory hyperpolarization or depression of activity upon return to static pressure. The sensitization was not caused by the release of prostacyclin from the endothelium since it was not reduced after endothelial denudation or inhibition of cyclooxygenase with indomethacin (30-80 microM) or ibuprofen (250 microM). We speculate that sensitization of baroreceptors by pulsatile pressure may contribute to the decreased sympathetic activity after periods of elevated pulse pressure (e.g., after exercise). We also propose that the decreased sensitivity of baroreceptors after acute elevation of arterial pressure (acute resetting) may be offset in part by the sensitizing effect of increased pulsatile stretch.\r"

  ".W": "Spatial variation in regional flows within the heart, skeletal muscle, and in other organs, and temporal variations in local arteriolar velocities and flows is measurable even with low resolution techniques. A problem in the assessment of the importance of such variations has been that the observed variance increases with increasing spatial or temporal resolution in the measurements. This resolution-dependent variance is now shown to be described by the fractal dimension, D. For example, the relative dispersion (RD = SD/mean) of the spatial distribution of flows for a given spatial resolution, is given by: RD(m) = RD(mref).[m/mref]1-Ds where m is the mass of the pieces of tissue in grams, and the reference level of dispersion, RD(mref), is taken arbitrarily to be the RD found using pieces of mass mref, which is chosen to be 1 g. Thus, the variation in regional flow within an organ can be described with two parameters, RD(mref) and the slope of the logarithmic relationship defined by the spatial fractal dimension Ds. In the heart, this relation has been found to hold over a wide range of piece sizes, the fractal Ds being about 1.2 and the correlation coefficient 0.99. A Ds of 1.2 suggests moderately strong correlation between local flows; a Ds = 1.0 indicates uniform flow and a Ds = 1.5 indicates complete randomness.\r"

When flow was arrested for 30 minutes, during which time the capillaries were exposed to inhibitors of ATP generation, and flow was then resumed with an oxygenated medium, cell membrane blebs and vacuolization, mitochondrial swelling, pericyte shrinkage, and interstitial space edema were observed. The permeability coefficients for labeled albumin, sucrose, and sodium increased to three to four times baseline values, whereas the permeability to water was not significantly modified. When the same protocol was repeated with phalloidin present in the medium throughout the experiment, the structural integrity of the endothelial cells was completely preserved and pericyte shrinkage was abolished, but interstitial space edema still occurred. The permeability to albumin, sucrose, and sodium increased only to 1.5 times baseline values, a significantly decreased increment in comparison with the experiments performed without phalloidin.

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that postischemic myocardial dysfunction (\"stunning\") may be mediated by oxygen free radicals, but the exact time window during which the critical radical-mediated damage develops remains unknown. Furthermore, the evidence for the oxyradical hypothesis is indirect and, therefore, inconclusive. Thus, the potent and cell-permeable antioxidant N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)-glycine (MPG) was administered as an intra-coronary infusion (8 mg/kg/hr) to three groups of open-chest dogs undergoing a 15-minute coronary occlusion followed by 4 hours of reperfusion. In group I (n = 8), the infusion of MPG was started 15 minutes before occlusion and ended 2 hours after reperfusion; in group II (n = 9), MPG was started 1 minute before reperfusion and ended 2 hours thereafter; in group III (n = 10), MPG was started 1 minute after reperfusion and ended 2 hours and 15 minutes thereafter. Control dogs (group IV) (n = 10) received vehicle. Recovery of contractile function (assessed as systolic wall thickening) was equivalent in groups I and II, and in both groups it was substantially greater than in controls (p less than 0.005 at 4 hours). In contrast, in group III recovery of function was indistinguishable from controls. To determine whether the protection afforded by MPG was due to inhibition of free radical reactions, myocardial production of free radicals was directly assessed by intracoronary infusion of the spin trap alpha-phenyl N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN). In control dogs (group VII, n = 6), radical adducts of PBN were released in the coronary venous blood after reperfusion, with a burst occurring in the first 5 minutes. MPG given as in group II (group V, n = 5) markedly suppressed myocardial production of PBN adducts (delta = -98% over 3 hours, p less than 0.01 vs. controls); this effect was evident immediately after reperfusion. MPG given as in group III (group VI, n = 5) also suppressed PBN adduct production (delta = -83% over 3 hours, p less than 0.025 vs. controls), but this effect was delayed. Hence, the radicals important in myocardial stunning appear to be those generated immediately after reperfusion. In vitro studies demonstrated that MPG is an exceptionally powerful scavenger of .OH (rate constant = 8.1 x 10(9) M-1 sec-1 by pulse radiolysis) but has no significant effect on .O2- (rate constant less than 10(3) M-1 sec-1), H2O2 (rate constant = 1.6 M-1 sec-1), or non-.OH-initiated lipid peroxidation, suggesting that removal of .OH is the major mechanism of the beneficial effects of MPG.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

RV latitudinal end-diastolic length was significantly augmented with increasing LV volume (latitudinal length in small, middle, and large LV volume; 9.68 +/- 0.55, 9.81 +/- 0.56, and 9.92 +/- 0.55 mm, respectively). RV meridional end-diastolic length also increased significantly with increasing LV volume.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventeen injections of radiolabeled albumin and EDTA as well as 201Tl and MIBI were performed by indicator-dilution techniques. When coronary flow was varied from 0.52 to 3.19 ml/g/min, myocardial extraction for MIBI averaged 0.38 +/- 0.09 (SD) whereas 201Tl myocardial extraction averaged 0.73 +/- 0.10 (p less than 0.001). Net extraction, which was calculated using end points of 1.8-4.9 minutes, averaged 0.41 +/- 0.15 for MIBI and was less than the 201Tl net extraction of 0.57 +/- 0.13 (p less than 0.001). The mean capillary permeability-surface area product for MIBI (0.44 +/- 0.13 ml/g/min) was one third of 201Tl (1.30 +/- 0.45 ml/g/min; p less than 0.001). However, parenchymal cell permeability-surface area product for MIBI (47.58 +/- 25.85 ml/g/min) was much higher than 201Tl (6.52 +/- 6.51 ml/g/min; p less than 0.0001), and apparent cellular volume of distribution for MIBI (15.15 +/- 3.31 ml/g) was also higher than 201Tl (10.19 +/- 4.00 ml/g; p less than 0.01). These data suggest that capillary permeability for 201Tl is greater than MIBI, but the reverse is true at the parenchymal cell wall.

Our objectives in this study have been to examine whether hypertrophy and fibrosis occur in a compensatory and reparative response to myocyte loss or whether either process may be occurring independently of myocyte loss and thus be a reactive response to adrenergic hormone stimulation. We have examined this question by evaluating each of these responses in rats treated with different doses and forms of isoproterenol administration. Myocyte necrosis was evaluated using in vivo labeling with monoclonal antimyosin for identification of myocytes with permeable sarcolemma, which was indicative of irreversible injury. Myocardial fibrosis was evaluated by morphometric point counting of Gomori-stained tissue sections and by assessment of the stimulation of fibroblast proliferation by determination of increased levels of DNA synthesis. Stimulation of fibroblast DNA synthesis was determined from DNA specific radioactivities and radioautography after pulse labeling with [3H]thymidine. The evidence provided by this study suggests that the degree and timing of myocardial hypertrophy does not follow the course of myocyte loss and, thus, appears to be either a response to altered cardiac loading or a reactive response to beta-adrenergic hormone stimulation rather than a compensation for myocyte loss. Myocardial fibrosis, on the other hand, appears to be more closely related to myocyte necrosis with respect to collagen accumulation in the same areas of the heart, its dose-response relation to the amount of isoproterenol administered, and the timing of increased DNA synthesis, or fibroblast proliferation, after myocyte loss.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of early coronary artery reperfusion on the relation between the extent of myocardial infarction and serum levels of cardiac myosin light chain II or plasma creatine kinase levels were evaluated in the conscious dog. Hydraulic occluders were placed on the left anterior descending arteries of 38 dogs. Seven to 10 days later, myocardial infarction was produced. Coronary reperfusion was performed 3 hours (group A1, n = 13) and 6 hours (group A2, n = 12) after the occlusion. In the other 13 dogs, coronary occlusion was sustained throughout the course of the experiment (group B). Seven days after the occlusion, the heart was cut from the apex to the base into 4-mm slices, and infarct size was determined macroscopically. Rapid appearance and early peaking of creatine kinase were observed in group A. Cumulative release of creatine kinase significantly correlated with infarct size in group A (infarct size ranged from 0.1 to 20.1 g, r = 0.90) and group B (from 0.6 to 26.8 g, r = 0.91). However, since creatine kinase release in group A was greater in comparison with that from infarcts of the same size in group B, the slope of the regression line for group A was significantly steeper (p less than 0.05). Cardiac myosin light chain II appeared as early as creatine kinase did and continued to be elevated for 7 days. A very close relation was observed between infarct size and total cardiac myosin light chain II release (r = 0.87 for group A, and r = 0.88 for group B) or peak level of light chain II (r = 0.85 for group A, and r = 0.81 for group B). In addition, the slopes of the regression lines for infarct size and both peak and total release of light chain II did not differ between group A and group B. On histological examination, viable myocardium was frequently observed in the epicardium of the ischemic area in group A1; therefore, infarct size was greater in group B than in group A1 (p less than 0.05). Also, myocardial creatine kinase content in the epicardium of the center of the ischemic area in group A1 was greater than that in group B. Cardiac myosin light chain II release in group A1 was less than that in group B, whereas no difference was found in plasma creatine kinase release among groups A1, A2, and B.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Coronary sinus occlusion retards necrosis of ischemic myocardium. To test the hypothesis that coronary sinus occlusion induces retrograde venoarterial flow, the coronary arteriovenous pressure gradient and the coronary arterial oxygen saturation were measured distal to a left anterior descending coronary artery ligature in dogs. In parallel, we constructed a mathematical model of known coronary physiology to characterize pressure and flow patterns during coronary sinus occlusion. In dogs, coronary sinus occlusion produced a systolic pressure gradient between the coronary artery and the coronary sinus of -20 +/- 9 mm Hg (higher venous pressure, p less than 0.0001) and a positive diastolic gradient of 3 +/- 5 mm Hg (lower venous pressure p less than 0.01). An average reduction in the oxygen saturation in the ligated coronary artery of 20 +/- 13% was also observed (p less than 0.005) consequent to admixture of venous (desaturated) blood. By graded inflation of the coronary sinus balloon, it was demonstrated that desaturation of arterial blood typically occurs above a coronary sinus systolic pressure of 40-50 mm Hg. The mathematical model indicates the possibility of venoarterial pressure gradients and reversal of flow at the microcirculatory level during coronary sinus occlusion. These studies provide evidence that retrograde flow into the ischemic zone occurs in association with intermittent coronary sinus occlusion. Thus, alternating flow over the ischemic territory may be the mechanism of myocardial salvage during intermittent coronary sinus occlusion.\r"

  ".U": "89355297\r", 
  ".W": "Electrical activity of enzymatically isolated, smooth muscle cells from hog carotid arteries was recorded under current clamp and voltage clamp. Under the experimental conditions, membrane potential usually was not stable, and spontaneous hyperpolarizing transients of approximately 100-msec duration were recorded. The amplitude of the transients was markedly voltage dependent and ranged from about 20 mV at a membrane potential of 0 mV to undetectable at membrane potentials negative to -60 mV. Under voltage clamp, transient outward currents displayed a similar voltage dependency. These fluctuations reflect a K+ current; they were abolished by 10 mM tetraethylammonium chloride, a K+ channel blocker, and the current fluctuations reversed direction in high extracellular K+ concentration. Modulators of intracellular Ca2+ concentration also affected electrical activity. Lowering intracellular Ca2+ concentration by addition of 10 mM EGTA to the pipette solution or suppressing sarcoplasmic reticulum function by superfusion with caffeine (10 mM), ryanodine (1 microM), or histamine (3-10 microM) blocked the rapid voltage and current spikes. However, caffeine and histamine induced a much slower hump of outward current before blocking the rapid spikes. This slower transient outward current could be elicited only once after external Ca2+ was removed and is consistent with an activation of K+ channels by Ca2+ released from internal stores. In contrast, removal of external Ca2+ alone failed to abolish the rapid spikes. These results suggest that 1) a Ca2+-dependent K+ conductance can markedly affect the electrical behavior of arterial smooth muscle cells and 2) internal Ca2+ stores, probably the sarcoplasmic reticulum, can support rapid and frequent releases of Ca2+. Exposure to a low concentration of histamine (3 microM) caused synchronization of the irregular, rapid fluctuations giving rise to slow, periodic oscillations of Ca2+-activated K+ conductance with a frequency of 0.1-0.3 Hz. These regular oscillations are reminiscent of periodic Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, were inhibited by 10 mM caffeine, and point to a modulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release by histamine.\r"

  ".W": "Lidocaine block of the cardiac sodium channel is believed to be primarily a function of channel state. For subthreshold potentials, block is limited to the inactivated state, whereas above threshold, block results from the combination of open- and inactivated-state block. Since, in the absence of drug, inactivation develops with time constants that vary from several hundred milliseconds to a few milliseconds as potential is varied from subthreshold to strongly depolarized levels, we would predict a similar voltage dependence of at least a fraction of block. Prior theoretical analyses from our laboratory suggest that there should be a direct parallel between blockade determined with a single pulse and trains of pulses. We tested these predictions by measuring the blockade of sodium current in cultured atrial myocytes during exposure to 80 microM lidocaine. We selected two test potentials for most of our studies, -80 mV, which was clearly in the subthreshold range of potentials, and -20 mV, which was close to the peak of the current-voltage curve. With single pulses of increasing duration, block developed with a single exponential time course and with time constants that decreased from 694 +/- 117 msec at -80 mV to 373 +/- 54 msec at -20 mV. In the absence of drug, inactivation developed with a time constant 176 +/- 17 at -80 mV and 2.9 +/- .5 msec at -20 mV. Despite the much slower onset of inactivation at -80 mV, no second-order delay in block development was observed. This suggests that at -80 mV block is occurring to a channel conformation that is accessed without delay rather than the classical inactivated state. We compared the kinetics of block during a single continuous pulse with trains of pulses at -20 mV. The rate of block onset was faster during the pulse trains, suggesting an element of \"activated state\" block. We computed shifts in apparent inactivation from observed steady-state blockade. The computed shifts agree well with those observed, indicating that shifts in apparent inactivation result largely from voltage-sensitive equilibrium blockade. The classical states described in the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism may be too restrictive to fully describe the voltage- and time-dependent block of cardiac sodium channels.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid deenergization procedure was used to probe the regulation of in situ adenylate deaminase and 5'-nucleotidase in isolated adult rat heart cells. In cells depleted of ATP, the rate of ionosine monophosphate (IMP) production was fourfold greater in cells that had been respiring prior to deenergization than in cells that had been maintaining ATP stores through anaerobic glycolysis. This effect of respiratory inhibition was fully reversed by reaeration. When phenylephrine was present during preincubation, IMP production during a subsequent 5-minute rapid deenergization was increased by 70% in respiring cells and by 88% in those that had not been respiring. These effects of phenylephrine were abolished by prazosin. Adenosine production by cells without ATP was inversely related to that of IMP, whereas it was positively correlated with the amount of AMP remaining in cells after 5 minutes. We conclude from these data that rat heart adenylate deaminase is regulated by a product(s) of anaerobic glycolysis and by alpha 1-adrenergic stimulation. The production of intracellular adenosine in cells without ATP, on the other hand, is governed primarily by the concentration of AMP and appears to be catalyzed by the cytosolic type I 5'-nucleotidase.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular mechanisms of Wenckebach periodicity were investigated in single, enzymatically dissociated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, as well as in computer reconstructions of transmembrane potential of the ventricular cell. When depolarizing current pulses of the appropriate magnitude were delivered repetitively to a well-polarized myocyte, rate-dependent activation failure was observed. Such behavior accurately mimicked the Wenckebach phenomenon in cardiac activation and was the consequence of variations in cell excitability during the diastolic phase of the cardiac cycle. The recovery of cell excitability during diastole was studied through the application of single test pulses of fixed amplitude and duration at variable delays with respect to a basic train of normal action potentials. The results show that recovery of excitability is a slow process that can greatly outlast action potential duration (i.e., postrepolarization refractoriness). Two distinct types of subthreshold responses were recorded when activation failure occurred: one was tetrodotoxin- and cobalt-insensitive (type 1) and the other was sensitive to sodium-channel blockade (type 2). Type 1 responses, which were commonly associated with the typical structure of the Wenckebach phenomenon (Mobitz type 1 block), were found to be the result of the nonlinear conductance properties of the inward rectifier current, IK1. Type 2 sodium-channel-mediated responses were associated with the so-called \"millisecond Wenckebach.\" These responses may be implicated in the mechanism of Mobitz type 2 rate-dependent block. Single-cell voltage-clamp experiments suggest that variations in excitability during diastole are a consequence of the slow deactivation kinetics of the delayed rectifier, IK. Computer simulations of the ventricular cell response to depolarizing current pulses reproduced very closely all the response patterns obtained in the experimental preparation. It is concluded that postrepolarization refractoriness and Wenckebach periodicity are properties of normal cardiac excitable cells and can be explained in terms of the voltage dependence and slow kinetics of potassium outward currents. The conditions for the occurrence of intermittent activation failure during diastole will depend on the frequency and magnitude of the driving stimulus.\r"

On the basis of our results, we developed a simplified analytical model for recovery of cell excitability during diastole. This model was based on the equations for current distribution in a resistive-capacitive circuit. A critical assumption in the model is that, in the voltage domain of the subthreshold responses, the sodium and calcium inward currents do not play a significant role, and only the two potassium outward currents, the delayed rectifier (IK) and the inward rectifier, are operative. The appropriate parameters needed to numerically solve the analytical model were measured in the guinea pig ventricular myocyte, as well as in the Beeler and Reuter cell. The curves of recovery of excitability and the rate-dependent activation patterns generated by numerical iteration of the analytical model equations closely reproduced the experimental results. Our analysis demonstrates that slow deactivation of the delayed rectifier current determines the observed variations in excitability during diastole, whereas the inward rectifier current determines the amplitude and shape of the subthreshold response. Both currents combined are responsible for the development of Wenckebach periodicities in the ventricular cell. The overall study provides new insight into the ionic mechanisms of rate-dependent conduction block processes and may have important clinical implications as well.\r"

Moreover, we consider finite deformations including inflation, extension, twist, and transmural shearing and suggest a new method for determination of the requisite deformation parameters directly from experimental strain data. We show representative transmural distributions of stress and strain, and perform a parametric study to illustrate differing predictions of stress induced by varying boundary conditions, muscle fiber orientations, or modes of deformation.

  ".W": "Several laboratories have reported that Na+-Li+ countertransport activities are increased in red blood cells from patients with essential hypertension. It has been proposed that the activity of this red blood cell transport system might reflect the activity of a similar system in vascular smooth muscle. We previously demonstrated Na+-Li+ exchange in sarcolemmal vesicles from canine artery and proposed that this transport function might be mediated by the Na+-H+ exchanger. In the present studies, however, we were unable to demonstrate Na+-Li+ countertransport in canine red blood cells. Since bovine red blood cells have a vigorous Na+-Li+ exchanger and we previously demonstrated Na+-H+ exchange in sarcolemmal vesicles from bovine artery, we wished to determine whether bovine sarcolemmal vesicles mediate Na+-Li+ exchange and whether this transport function is mediated via the Na+-H+ exchanger. We found that an outwardly directed proton or Li+ gradient stimulated 22Na+ uptake in sarcolemmal vesicles from bovine superior mesenteric artery. Li+ gradient-stimulated Na+ uptake was not due to electrical coupling between the two ions, was not affected by a change in membrane potential, and could not be explained by the parallel operation of Li+-H+ and Na+-H+ exchange. External Li+ inhibited proton gradient-stimulated Na+ uptake, and external protons inhibited Li+ gradient-stimulated Na+ uptake. Na+ efflux from vesicles was stimulated by inwardly directed gradients for Li+ or protons, and these effects were not additive. Proton efflux from vesicles was stimulated by inwardly directed gradients for Na+ or Li+, and these effects were not additive. Finally, Na+-H+ exchange and Na+-Li+ exchange in sarcolemmal vesicles were inhibited by 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride in an identical dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, Na+-Li+ countertransport could not be demonstrated in canine red blood cells, but as is the case with bovine red blood cells, sarcolemmal vesicles from bovine artery mediate Na+-Li+ countertransport. This transport function and sarcolemmal Na+-H+ exchange are mediated via a single 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride-sensitive cation exchanger with affinity for Na+, Li+, and protons. The cow, as opposed to the dog, may be a good animal model to test whether the activity of red blood cell Na+-Li+ countertransport is predictive of the activity of Na+-Li+ (and Na+-H+) exchange in vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Excitability was maintained at doses of both anesthetics that reversibly abolished current flow through junctional membranes. The degree of reduction of junctional conductance was a steep function of the dose of anesthetic; complete block occurred at lower aqueous concentrations of halothane than ethrane. The time course for loss of communication was rapid; 90% reduction of initial junctional conductance occurred in less than 15 seconds after exposure to 2 mM halothane or 4 mM ethrane. Recovery of junctional conductance and junctional permeability to intracellularly injected Lucifer yellow was rapid and complete on washout of the anesthetics. As junctional conductance was reduced by halothane or ethrane exposure, unitary conductance of the gap junctional channels remained constant at about 50 pS. Uncoupling by these anesthetics is thus attributable to a decrease in the number of conducting channels rather than to reduction of the channel's unitary conductance. The data are discussed with regard to the possible role of this intercellular communication pathway in the arrhythmias and alterations of conduction velocity and contractility produced by volatile anesthetics.\r"

  ".W": "The calcium-channel inhibiting agent, diltiazem, has been shown to enhance salvage of reperfused myocardium independent of effects on coronary blood flow or myocardial work. Because lipid peroxidation may be a mediator of reperfusion injury and modifiable by calcium-sensitive pathways, we evaluated the effects of diltiazem on the formation of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, in isolated rabbit hearts perfused with buffer under control conditions or after 60 minutes of ischemia with or without 3 minutes of reperfusion. Diltiazem (5 x 10(-7)M) reduced tissue MDA content in seven reperfused hearts compared with levels measured in 14 hearts reperfused without drug (1.54 +/- 1.09 [SD] compared with 3.57 +/- 1.88 nmol/g, p less than 0.05). Superoxide dismutase and catalase were ineffective in reducing tissue MDA content in reperfused hearts (n = 8; MDA concentration, 3.88 +/- 2.82 nmol/g) although they were effective in preventing lipid peroxidation in separate studies in which oxygen-centered free radicals were generated directly by an infusion of xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine. These results suggest that the salutary effects of diltiazem in the setting of reperfusion may be mediated by reduction of lipid peroxidation at a locus not accessible to scavengers of oxygen-centered free radicals or by a mechanism not mediated by free radical pathways.\r"

The cumulative survival at 5 and 10 years after the onset was 91.0 +/- 3.3% and 84.0 +/- 5.6% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. The event-free survival rates at the same intervals after onset were 74.9 +/- 5.0% and 64.0 +/- 7.4%, respectively. The overall survival and event-free survival at 10 years after diagnosis was 80.3 +/- 6.5% and 61.6 +/- 7.5%, respectively.

Severe hypertension (p less than 0.01), severe functional disability (p less than 0.01), and evidence of cardiac involvement (p less than 0.05) were good predictors of either death or major event on follow-up. These data are useful in making an objective assessment of the prognosis and in planning elective interventions.\r"

There were 118 cardiac events: 11 cardiac deaths, 12 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, and 95 coronary revascularization (bypass or angioplasty) procedures. A Cox survival analysis identified echocardiographic positivity after dipyridamole administration as the best predictor of cardiac events (relative risk ratio, 2.7). The next most powerful predictor was angina after dipyridamole administration (relative risk ratio, 1.9). Cardiac events occurred in 14 (6%) of 253 patients with normal high-dose dipyridamole echocardiographic test results, in 21 (26%) of 82 patients with high-dose dipyridamole echocardiographic positivity (0.84 mg/kg during 10 minutes), and in 83 (41%) of 204 patients with low-dose dipyridamole echocardiographic positivity (0.56 mg/kg during 4 minutes) (p less than 0.0001). In a subset of 341 patients, exercise electrocardiography stress test and coronary angiography were also available. A Cox survival analysis again identified echocardiographic positivity after dipyridamole as the best predictor of cardiac events (relative risk ratio, 1.9) followed by a pathologic coronary arteriography (relative risk ratio, 1.2). We conclude that the presence and timing of a transient dyssynergy during dipyridamole stress are useful predictors of subsequent cardiac events.\r"

Biplane views of the circumflex (Cx) and left anterior descending (LAD) coronary arteries were obtained before and 80 seconds after inducing a maximal increase in flow selectively in the Cx by injecting 7 mg papaverine through a 2F infusion catheter in the midportion of the Cx (n = 10). The diameter of the proximal Cx segment (exposed to increased flow but not to papaverine directly) increased with papaverine by 11.1 +/- 4% (range, 5.2-16.4%, p less than 0.001 vs. control), whereas the LAD diameter did not change. LAD and Cx diameters increased by 18.3% and 21.2% after nitroglycerin given into the left main artery, which showed the preserved capability of the LAD to dilate. In four patients with normal coronary arteries and six patients with coronary artery disease (CAD, non-flow-limiting stenosis), a similar protocol was applied with the LAD for the assessment of flow-dependent dilatation. Simultaneously, intracoronary blood flow velocity was measured by an intracoronary Doppler catheter. Papaverine-induced coronary flow reserve (peak/resting velocity ratio) in the LAD was 4 +/- 0.7 (range, 3.5-5) in normal arteries and was 3.5 +/- 0.6 (range, 2.7-4.4) in CAD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of intracoronary infusions of substance P in conscious humans on epicardial vessel diameter and coronary sinus oxygen saturation were investigated in 13 patients who had angiographically normal coronary arteries. The dose of substance P ranged from 2.8 to 89.6 pmol/min, starting at 2.8 pmol/min and rising by doubling increments. All infusions were performed for 2-minute periods. Epicardial vessel diameter was measured by a computerized analysis system (CAAS) of the angiogram performed at the end of each infusion period. Coronary sinus oxygen saturation (CSO2) was measured continuously by a fiber-optic oximeter catheter in the coronary sinus. A reduction of arterial pressure, indicative of a systemic effect of substance P, occurred only when infusions were 44.8 pmol/min or more. At considerably smaller dosages, a dose-dependent increase in the left anterior descending artery diameter was seen with substance P; maximal dilation occurred at a dosage of 11.2 pmol/min. The percent increase in vessel diameter for this dosage was 29.4 +/- 19.8% (mean +/- SD) at the distal site of analysis and 16.7 +/- 10% at the proximal site of analysis. CSO2 rose in a dose-dependent manner and was maximal at a dosage of 11.2 pmol/min, which caused a 14.6 +/- 7.2% O2 rise above the preinfusion saturation of 43.5 +/- 11.1% O2. As the heart rate-blood pressure double product showed no change, it is argued that these changes in CSO2 probably reflect rises in coronary flow that were seen with dosages of substance P without systemic effect. In three patients, preconstriction induced by ergonovine was reversed by substance P infusions, which produced a degree of dilation equivalent to that of isosorbide dinitrate. We conclude that substance P at very small dosages, which are without peripheral effects, causes in vivo epicardial coronary artery dilatation as well as resistive vessel dilatation in humans.\r"

We evaluated the effect of alpha-adrenoceptor blockade on either endogenous vascular sympathetic activation (obtained through the application of a nonhypotensive lower-body negative pressure, -10 mm Hg for 5 minutes) or selective postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation by exogenous norepinephrine (0.005 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 3 minutes) in the presence of beta-blockade by propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 15 minutes). Drugs were infused into the brachial artery at systemically ineffective rates while continuously monitoring forearm blood flow (by venous plethysmography), intra-arterial mean arterial pressure, and heart rate in patients with essential hypertension. The irreversible antagonist phenoxybenzamine was used at a rate of 20 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 1 hour, which antagonized the local responses to norepinephrine in a range of 0.005-0.05 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min. During saline administration, either lower-body negative pressure or exogenous norepinephrine decreased forearm blood flow comparably. However, after phenoxybenzamine administration, forearm vasoconstriction to norepinephrine was abolished while a residual response to lower-body negative pressure remained in each patient. To exclude insufficient alpha-adrenoceptor blockade, the same experimental protocol was repeated by doubling phenoxybenzamine concentrations. No difference from the data obtained with the lower level of antagonist was found. Further studies were performed to confirm the sympathetic origin of the residual vasoconstriction. Bretylium tosylate, a neurotransmitter blocker, infused into the brachial artery (50 micrograms/100 ml forearm tissue/min for 90 minutes) abolished the effect of endogenous sympathetic activation but did not alter the effect of exogenous norepinephrine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown in studies of experimental animals that myocardium exhibits a cardiac cycle-dependent variation of integrated backscatter that reflects regional myocardial contractile performance and that is blunted promptly after arterial occlusion and recovers after reperfusion. To define the clinical utility of ultrasonic tissue characterization with integrated backscatter for detection of acute myocardial infarction and reperfusion, 21 patients (14 men and seven women) were studied in the cardiac care unit within the first 24 hours (mean time, 11.3 hours; range, 3.5-23.8 hours) after the onset of symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction with conventional two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography and with analysis of integrated backscatter. The magnitude of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter was measured from several sites within acute infarct regions and normal regions remote from the infarct zone for each patient. The average magnitude of cyclic variation among all patients (n = 21) was 4.8 +/- 0.5 dB in normal regions compared with 0.8 +/- 0.3 dB in infarct regions (p less than 0.05) within the first 24 hours after the onset of symptoms. Among the patients who had two studies, 15 (mean, 7.1 days; range, 2-31 days for second study) underwent coronary arteriography to define vessel patency. In patients with vessels with documented patency (n = 10), the magnitude of cyclic variation in infarct regions increased over time from 1.3 +/- 0.6 to 2.5 +/- 0.5 dB from the initial to final study (p less than 0.05). Patients with occluded infarct-related arteries (n = 5) exhibited no significant recovery of cyclic variation (0.3 +/- 0.3-0.6 +/- 0.3 dB). A blinded analysis of standard two-dimensional echocardiographic images revealed no significant recovery of wall thickening in either group over the same time intervals. Ultrasonic tissue characterization promptly detects acute myocardial infarction and may delineate potential beneficial effects of coronary artery reperfusion manifest by restoration of cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in the presence of severe wall motion abnormalities.\r"

Simultaneous Doppler and catheter pressure gradients in 36 patients (mean age, 63 +/- 13 years) with 42 prosthetic valves (20 aortic, 20 mitral, one tricuspid, and one pulmonary) were studied. Catheter gradients were obtained using a dual-catheter technique. The simultaneous pressure tracings and Doppler flow velocity profiles were digitized at 10-msec intervals to derive the corresponding maximal and mean gradients. The correlation between the maximal Doppler gradient and the simultaneously measured maximal catheter gradient was 0.94 (SEE = 6), and that between the Doppler gradient and the simultaneously measured mean catheter gradient was 0.96 (SEE = 3). There were no significant differences in correlation between gradients for the 32 mechanical valves (maximal gradients: r = 0.95, SEE = 6; mean gradients: r = 0.96, SEE = 3) and the 10 bioprosthetic valves (maximal gradients: r = 0.89, SEE = 6; mean gradients: r = 0.93, SEE = 3). In patients with mitral prostheses, Doppler gradients correlated well with the corresponding catheter gradients obtained with direct measurement of left atrial pressure (maximal gradients: r = 0.96, SEE = 2; mean gradients: r = 0.97, SEE = 1.2). A close correlation between corresponding Doppler and catheter gradients also was found in patients with aortic prostheses (maximal gradients: r = 0.94, SEE = 6; mean gradients: r = 0.94, SEE = 3). Thus, continuous wave Doppler echocardiography can accurately predict the pressure gradient across prosthetic valves.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if mitral valve morphology influences the results of double-balloon catheter balloon valvuloplasty (CBV) for mitral stenosis, two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in 33 patients before CBV. The two-dimensional echocardiographic features of leaflet motion, leaflet thickness, subvalvular disease, and commissural calcium and 14 pre-CBV clinical and hemodynamic variables were then correlated to the immediately post-CBV mitral valve area (MVA). At 3 months after CBV, the two-dimensional echocardiographic features of patients with a 25% or greater decrease in MVA were analyzed to determine whether mitral valve morphology had influenced early results. Leaflet motion had a significant relation with the immediately post-CBV MVA (r = 0.67, y = 4.5x + 0.29, and SEE = 0.45). Leaflet thickness had a weak and negative relation (r = -0.48, y = -0.17x + 2.6, and SEE = 0.53) with the immediately post-CBV MVA. Subvalvular disease and commissural calcium had no significant relation to the immediately post-CBV MVA. When leaflet motion and leaflet thickness were considered as grades of mild, moderate, and severe and assigned a score of 0-2, patients with more severe disease (total score, 3 or 4) had a significant lower MVA immediately after CBV (1.4 +/- 0.4 cm2) than patients with moderate disease (score, 1-2; MVA, 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm2; p less than 0.05) or mild disease (score, 0; MVA, 2.6 +/- 0.6 cm2; p less than 0.05). In 96% of patients with a total score of 0-2, the immediately post-CBV MVA was more than 1.4 cm2, whereas only 29% of patients with a total score of 3-4 had an immediately post-CBV MVA of more than 1.4 cm2. Analysis of all two-dimensional echocardiographic features showed that leaflet motion score had the strongest influence on the post-CBV MVA (p less than 0.001). When all two-dimensional echocardiographic, clinical, and hemodynamic variables were included, leaflet motion, effective balloon dilating area, and cardiac output were the strongest predictors of the immediate post-CB MVA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have found distinct recovery loop patterns of ST segment depression that distinguish subjects without coronary disease from patients with coronary artery disease when ST segment depression is examined in the heart rate domain. Continuous plots of ST segment depression and heart rate were constructed throughout treadmill exercise and recovery in 100 clinically normal subjects, in 124 patients with coronary artery disease proven by catheterization, and in 17 patients with no significant coronary disease at catheterization. Among clinically normal subjects, 95% (95 of 100) had normal (clockwise) rate-recovery loops, and 5% (five of 100) had abnormal (counterclockwise) rate-recovery loops. In these normal subjects, the resulting 95% specificity of a normal rate-recovery loop was similar to the 93% (93 of 100) specificity of standard end-exercise ST segment depression criteria. Among patients with coronary disease proven by angiography, 93% (115 of 124) had abnormal (counterclockwise) rate-recovery loops, and 7% (nine of 124) had normal rate-recovery loops.

Myocardial infarction complicated the conduction disturbances in 24 of the 64 RBBB and in 18 of the 40 LBBB patients. A correlation coefficient was used for assessing the similarity of each map pattern with the normal mean IQRST map. The difference map was made by subtracting the average normal IQRST map from each abnormal IQRST map, and those differences that were less than 2 SD from the mean were retained as a significant area. The number of leads and their sum of differences were used to represent the size of the difference map. Correlation coefficients were significantly (p less than 0.001) smaller in patients with bundle branch block complicated by myocardial infarction than in patients with conduction disturbances not complicated by myocardial infarction. A significant area emerged in the difference map in all patients with myocardial infarction complicated by conduction disturbances. The emergence of a significant area revealed high diagnostic accuracy for detecting myocardial infarction in group RBBB (89.1%).

During long-term treatment with metoprolol, there was an increase in ejection fraction from 0.24 to 0.42 (p less than 0.0001), whereas there was a decrease in the left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension (from 7.3 to 6.4 cm, p less than 0.0001), in the grade of mitral regurgitation (from 1.7 to 0.4, p less than 0.0001), and in the grade of tricuspid regurgitation (from 0.6 to 0.05, p less than 0.007). There was a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure (from 23.8 to 10.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001), LV end-diastolic pressure (from 24.1 to 13.4 mm Hg, p less than 0.002), and systolic vascular resistance (from 1,782 to 1,499 dynes/sec/cm, p less than 0.04). There was an increase in systolic blood pressure (from 116 to 132 mm Hg, p less than 0.003), cardiac index (from 2.17 to 2.58 l/min/m2, p less than 0.005), and LV stroke work index (from 31 to 65 g.m/m2, p less than 0.0001). During withdrawal of metoprolol, the heart rate and left atrial dimension increased (p less than 0.0001), whereas ejection fraction decreased (p less than 0.0001). The 12 (of 16) patients in group 1 who survived the withdrawal period had metoprolol readministered, and subsequently, ejection fraction increased (from 0.23 to 0.33, p less than 0.002). Patients had a low number of ventricular beta-adrenergic receptors compared with healthy control subjects (30.3 +/- 2.9 vs. 97.4 +/- 8.7 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.001), but long-term treatment with metoprolol caused a moderate up-regulation (from 30.3 +/- 2.9 to 49.0 +/- 7.1 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05), which may facilitate a more normal response to sympathetic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using the records linkage system of the Mayo Clinic and of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which accesses diagnostic data on the entire population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we identified 45 new cases of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and 19 new cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) among county residents for the years 1975-1984. Overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were 6.0/100,000 and 2.5/100,000 person-years, respectively. The incidence of DCM doubled from 3.9/100,000 in the first 5 years to 7.9/100,000 person-years in the last 5 years of study. The corresponding change for HCM was from 1.4 to 3.6/100,000 person-years. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence rates as of January 1, 1985, for DCM and HCM were 36.5/100,000 and 19.7/100,000 population, respectively. The prevalence of DCM in persons less than 55 years old was 17.9/100,000, over a third of whom were New York Heart Association functional Class III or IV at diagnosis. These estimates may be of value in determining the potential use of health care resources, particularly cardiac transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Deranged magnesium concentrations in serum and cardiovascular structures have been implicated in the pathophysiology of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, arrhythmias, and sudden death. This study was conducted to determine the status and interrelation of serum and tissue concentrations of magnesium in patients with congestive heart failure, a clinical setting purportedly predisposed to the development of depleted levels of this cation. Magnesium concentrations of serum, circulating mononuclear cells, skeletal muscle, and myocardium were measured in 23 patients with heart failure on standard therapy. Two patients were hypomagnesemic (less than 1.6 meq/l). Poor or no correlations were found between serum and tissue magnesium concentrations and among the magnesium concentrations of the three tissues studied. Strong direct correlations were, however, noted between magnesium and potassium concentrations of the tissues examined. The prevalence of hypomagnesemia in this typical ambulatory heart failure population is relatively low (9%) and serum, circulating mononuclear cell, skeletal muscle, and myocardial magnesium concentrations correlate poorly with each other. Serum, circulating mononuclear cell, and skeletal muscle magnesium concentrations are thus of little predictive value in assessing the status of myocardial magnesium in humans with heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "89355345\r", 
  ".W": "Mitral valve prolapse has been diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiographic criteria with surprising frequency in the general population, even when preselected normal subjects are examined. In most of these individuals, however, prolapse appears in the apical four-chamber view and is absent in roughly orthogonal long-axis views. Previous studies of in vitro models with nonplanar rings have shown that systolic mitral annular nonplanarity can potentially produce this discrepancy. However, to prove directly that apparent leaflet displacement in a two-dimensional view does not constitute true displacement above the three-dimensional annulus requires reconstruction of the entire mitral valve, including leaflets and annulus. Such reconstruction would also be necessary to explore the complex geometry of the valve and to derive volumetric measures of superior leaflet displacement. A technique was therefore developed and validated in vitro for three-dimensional reconstruction of the entire mitral valve. In this technique, simultaneous real-time acquisition of images and their spatial locations permits reconstruction of a localized structure by minimizing the effects of patient motion and respiration. By applying this method to 15 normal subjects, a coherent mitral valve surface could be reconstructed from intersecting scans. The results confirm mitral annular nonplanarity in systole, with a maximum deviation of 1.4 +/- 0.3 cm from planarity. They directly show that leaflets can appear to ascend above the mitral annulus in the apical four-chamber view, as they did in at least one view in all subjects, without actual leaflet displacement above the entire mitral valve in three dimensions, thereby challenging the diagnosis of prolapse by isolated four-chamber view displacement in otherwise normal individuals. This technique allows us to address a uniquely three-dimensional problem with high resolution and provide new information previously unavailable from the two-dimensional images. This new appreciation should enhance our ability to ask appropriate clinical questions relating mitral valve shape and leaflet displacement to clinical and pathologic consequences.\r"

  ".U": "89355346\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred one consecutive patients with chronic coronary artery disease who had survived out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the absence of acute myocardial infarction underwent electrophysiologic evaluation and were followed prospectively. Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were inducible in 76 patients (75%) in the control state and were suppressed by antiarrhythmic drugs or surgery in 32 of the 76 patients (42%). During a mean follow-up of 27 months, cardiac arrest recurred in 21 patients: in two of the 25 patients in whom ventricular tachyarrhythmias were not inducible in the control state, three of the 32 in whom inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias were suppressed after treatment, and 16 of the 44 in whom inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias could not be suppressed after treatment. Actuarial rate of cardiac arrest recurrence was 11.2% during the first 6 months of follow-up (\"high-risk early phase\") and then decreased to less than 4% in each subsequent 6-month period. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified an ejection fraction less than 35% (p = 0.0013) and persistent inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (p = 0.0025) as independent predictors of cardiac arrest recurrence for the entire follow-up period. Separate analysis of variables within and after the first 6 months showed that an ejection fraction less than 35% was the strongest predictor for early phase recurrence (p = 0.0078) but had only marginally significant predictive value for late phase recurrence (p = 0.0516). Persistent inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias had no significant predictive value for early phase recurrence (p = 0.1382) but was the strongest predictor for late phase recurrence (p = 0.0061). These data suggest that, in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who survive out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, poor ejection fraction and persistent inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias have a different predictive influence on early and late phase recurrence. Time-dependent risk factor analysis may have great clinical relevance in assessing an individual's changing risk over time.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether or not the previously reported association between alcohol intake and high blood pressure is influenced by differential intake of calcium and potassium in drinkers compared with nondrinkers and to assess the magnitude of the independent contributions of alcohol, calcium, and potassium to blood pressure, these associations were evaluated in 7,011 men of Japanese descent. Categorical analyses and multiple linear regression techniques were used to test the hypotheses that alcohol, calcium, and potassium were independent predictors of blood pressure. Alcohol consumption above a threshold of approximately 20 ml/day was found to be positively, strongly, and independently correlated with systolic and diastolic pressures, and this effect was completely independent of the effects of calcium and potassium. Calcium and potassium intake were highly correlated (r = 0.59) and were inversely related to blood pressure, and their combined effect was greater than the effect of either alone. However, in the subgroup of moderate and heavier drinkers, only potassium was inversely related to blood pressure. This finding is compatible with previous reports of malabsorption and increased excretion of calcium at higher levels of alcohol intake, and it indicates that a small portion of the alcohol-induced blood pressure elevation may be mediated through calcium depletion. In the range of dietary intake in this cohort, the effect of alcohol on blood pressure was stronger than was either the separate or combined effects of calcium and potassium.\r"
