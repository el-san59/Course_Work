  ".W": "Intra-arterial chemotherapy for the treatment of localized malignant neoplasms in the head and neck is an appealing approach for several reasons. Perhaps the most important is the possibility of obtaining a regional advantage such that an increased drug concentration is delivered systemically. The patient may, therefore, be spared systemic toxicity. We report our accumulated experience using a totally implantable infusion pump in 37 patients. A total of 42 pumps were implanted: 28 single-catheter pumps and 14 dual-catheter pumps. Radionuclide imaging demonstrated total perfusion of the tumor in all patients. A combination of cisplatin (50 to 100 mg/m2) and floxuridine (0.01 to 0.045 mg/kg/d) was used to treat 26 patients. For these heavily pretreated patients, we observed a 43% complete and partial response rate in the subgroup of patients with squamous cell carcinoma. These results are comparable with those reported for these drugs administered systemically and for other drug combinations tested in the treatment of recurrence disease.\r"

To evaluate this possibility, we have reviewed the clinical and histopathologic features of 43 consecutive cases of previously untreated T2 or greater squamous cell carcinoma of these sites managed with simultaneous surgical treatment of the primary neoplasm and the neck. The incidence of histologically proved cervical metastasis for all lesions with vascular invasion compared with those without vascular involvement was highly significant. No statistical correlation was found for the clinical stage of neck disease or for the other pathologic features of the primary tumor, ie, size, appearance, differentiation, depth of invasion, periphery of lesion, inflammatory infiltrate, and perineural invasion, when compared with the histopathologic status of regional lymph nodes.\r"

However, using whole-organ sectioning techniques, it has been demonstrated that vertical partial laryngectomy is a sound oncologic procedure for selected fixed vocal cord lesions. During the period 1969 to 1984, 27 patients who presented at UCLA with T3 glottic carcinoma were treated using vertical partial laryngectomy. Follow-up for these patients averaged 4.0 years. The absolute two-year disease-free survival rate for this group was 85% (23 of 27 patients), and the local cancer recurrence rate during a two-year postoperative interval was 11% (three of 27 patients). These encouraging results support the continued use of partial laryngeal surgery for a subgroup of patients with T3 glottic cancer. Successful patient selection requires a careful analysis of disease extent based on data obtained from physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scanning, and direct laryngoscopy.\r"

Patients with NK activity of less than 60 LU (n = 99) developed DMs at a higher rate than the remaining group. Further stratification of patients on the bases of both regional nodal disease and treatment demonstrated that the risk of DMs predominantly involved one group, ie, patients with histopathologically documented nodal metastases, NK activity of less than 60 LU, and prior treatment with combined surgery and radiation therapy (12[46%] of 26 patients). If one of these three factors was absent, the risk of DMs was not greater than 12%, regardless of the factor. Head and neck cancer patients should be stratified by pretreatment natural immune status to determine the impact of therapy on disease progression.\r"

The aim is to reduce the free space between the roof and floor of the oral cavity to permit stronger lingual propulsion during oral deglutition and better linguopalatal contact during articulation. We evaluated ten patients who received this device after glossectomy during the past two years. Modified barium swallows and voice recordings were performed when possible with and without the use of the palatal augmentation prosthesis. Articulatory and deglutitory functions were evaluated on a scaled score ranging from 0 to 10 points. The scores of the patients' average immediate improvements were 4.5 points (range, 2 to 7) for articulation and 3.5 points (range, 2 to 7) for deglutition; the scores of average long-term improvements were 3.4 points (range, 2 to 7) and 2.2 points (range, 6 to 8), respectively. Patients using the palatal augmentation prosthesis experienced significant improvement in both functions. We believe that this device contributes greatly to rehabilitative therapy for patients who have undergone extirpative surgery for tumors of the oral cavity.\r"

  ".W": "While a number of flaps are available that can \"plug the hole\" created by the resection of an oral cavity malignancy, the final functional and cosmetic result is often far from satisfactory. The ideal flap for this area should provide a one-stage, reliable reconstruction (regardless of previous surgery or irradiation) with the options of thin pliable skin and/or vascularized bone. Donor-site morbidity must be acceptable. In our experience, the free radial forearm flap best approaches these ideals. Unfortunately, it has received relatively little attention in the otolaryngology literature. The results of using 15 of these flaps to reconstruct 14 oral cavity defects are reported here. Despite the fact that most of the reconstructions were performed in older patients who had undergone irradiation (nine of 14) and previous surgical treatment (ten of 14), there were no flap failures. Hospital stays were short (less than two weeks), cosmetic results were good, and all but one patient had resumed oral intake by the time of hospital discharge. The specific applications and limitations of this flap are emphasized so that the reader can better understand its role in head and neck reconstructive surgery.\r"

Treatment included surgery (or biopsy) and chemotherapy for all patients and radiotherapy in the majority. The actuarial estimate of the three-year survival rate for all patients was 83% and did not differ significantly by primary site, histologic findings, or presence of adenopathy. A trend for a worse survival rate was seen in clinical group III patients and in those less than 5 years of age at diagnosis. Factors associated with an increased risk of local/regional relapse included omission of radiotherapy and a radiation dose of less than 40 Gy (4000 rad). We conclude that treatment of these patients as recommended in the IRS-I and IRS-II protocols results in very good local and regional tumor control and survival rates. Salvage therapy for local/regional recurrence may yield long-term remission and possibly cure.\r"

Contrary to the autosomal-dominant heritable cancer syndromes, there is no clear genetic pattern seen in oropharyngeal or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Pedigree data demonstrating clusters of affected relatives suggest that some head and neck squamous cell cancers result from an interaction between environmental factors and germinal predisposition. Though no genetic marker has been described for head and neck epidermoid carcinomas, some heritable single tumor syndromes demonstrate increased amounts of hyperdiploidy (defined as a metaphase with more than 46 chromosomes exclusive of 92) in in vitro cultures of dermal fibroblasts. In the present study, dermal fibroblasts were cultured from 30 patients with biopsy-proved oropharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell cancer. Compared with the percentage of cells with in vitro hyperdiploidy (IVH) of 0% to 1% in 155 clinically normal individuals without a family cancer history, 13 (43%) of these 30 patients had significantly elevated (7% to 12%) IVH. Six of the seven clinically affected women had IVH, a proportion significantly greater than that for the men. In vitro hyperdiploidy remained stable for each assayed cell line from the third through sixth passage. Each patient's IVH percentage of dermal and oropharyngeal fibroblasts remained nearly constant varying 0% to 1%. The stability of the hyperdiploid fraction independent of the biopsy site eliminates local factors as the sources of the elevated IVH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 1986 the sections showed classic plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy. In 1981 they revealed migration of myofibroblasts into the intima and lumen of pulmonary arteries and arterioles, the identification of the cells being confirmed by electron microscopy. During the five years that the pulmonary vascular pathology progressed to the formation of plexiform lesions there was an increase in the number of bronchiolar endocrine cells that were immunoreactive to bombesin and calcitonin. This study demonstrates that the classic pathogenesis of primary plexogenic pulmonary arteriopathy originates years earlier as a migration of cells of muscular pedigree from the media into the intima of the pulmonary arteries and arterioles.\r"

In all patients pulsed wave Doppler scanning detected turbulent flow at the apex of the right ventricle or adjacent to a wall motion abnormality affecting the interventricular septum. Pulsed wave Doppler detected coexisting mitral regurgitation in one patient and tricuspid regurgitation in another two. In all patients a left to right shunt was confirmed by oximetry and the location of the defect was identified by angiography or at operation or necropsy. Cross sectional echocardiography in combination with pulsed wave Doppler scanning is useful in the rapid bedside evaluation of patients with ventricular septal defect after myocardial infarction.\r"

Thirty six (57%) patients had an oesophageal abnormality (group B); 19 patients had gastro-oesophageal reflux and abnormal oesophageal motility, five had gastro-oesophageal reflux alone, and 12 had abnormal oesophageal motility alone. Only four had regional abnormalities of the left ventricular wall and abnormal oesophageal function. In nine (14%) patients left ventricular and oesophageal function were normal (group C). Psychiatric morbidity was significantly less common in group A than in groups B and C and was similar in group B and group C. A definite abnormality of left ventricular function, oesophageal function, or psychiatric morbidity is present in a high proportion of patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms and in some instances this may lead to specific treatment. If quantitative assessment of left ventricular function is normal, oesophageal investigations should be performed. Endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract may demonstrate oesophageal disease, but, if findings are normal, oesophageal manometry and ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring (including during treadmill exercise testing) should be carried out.\r"

In 14 patients who did not receive thrombolytic treatment there was a linear relation between infarct size (determined by serial creatine kinase-MB determinations and thallium-201 isotope emission tomography) and the C-reactive protein response. The correlation coefficient between the concentration-time integrals of creatine kinase-MB and C-reactive protein was 0.96. The correlation coefficient between the creatine kinase-MB concentration-time integral and the peak serum value of C-reactive protein was 0.93. In the nine patients who received intravenous streptokinase treatment there was also a positive correlation between the concentration-time integrals of creatine kinase-MB and C-reactive protein. The relation, however, depended on the success of the treatment. In patients with successful reperfusion the C-reactive protein response was only approximately 20% of that in patients in whom reperfusion failed or who received no thrombolytic treatment and who were matched by infarct size. When thrombolysis was successful the correlation coefficient between the concentration-time integrals of creatine kinase-MB and C-reactive protein was 0.86. Daily measurement of serum C-reactive protein is useful in evaluating infarct size in patients with acute myocardial infarction who do not receive thrombolytic treatment. In patients treated with streptokinase C-reactive protein concentrations may be used to assess the success of thrombolysis.\r"

They were studied by echocardiography before the procedure, immediately after it, and at follow up (mean (SD) 10.2 (5.6) months, n = 18). The morphology of the pulmonary valve, the right ventricular-pulmonary artery gradient, and ratio of the systolic to diastolic endocardial dimensions (infundibular ratio) were examined. No patient had pulmonary regurgitation before the study. The valve gradient was significantly reduced (47%) from a mean (SD) of 72 (31) to 37 (23) mm Hg with no short term change in cardiac index after dilatation with a balloon with a mean (SD) diameter that was 118 (10.8)% of the valve annulus. The infundibular ratio was unchanged by the procedure (0.49 (0.11) (n = 21) before dilatation and 0.47 (0.14) (n = 16) after dilatation). In twenty seven patients the commissure of the pulmonary valve was seen to be torn after dilatation. Two patients with bicuspid valves had flail leaflets. Doppler examination at follow up showed mild pulmonary insufficiency in all 29 patients; the mean (SD) valve gradient (31 (+/- 21) mm Hg) at follow up was no different from the gradient found immediately after the procedure and infundibular ratio (0.58 (0.15) was not abnormal. These data indicate that commissural tears are the primary mechanism of valve disruption and demonstrate that the dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction relaxes and gradient reduction persists at follow up.\r"

  ".W": "The efficacy of transvenous cardioversion and defibrillation for treating life threatening spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias was assessed in a study of 17 patients in a cardiac care unit. Eleven had ventricular tachycardia, five had ventricular fibrillation, and one had both. Transvenous cardioversion successfully terminated tachyarrhythmias on 42 separate occasions in ten patients. Stable electrode positions could not be achieved in two patients, recurrent late displacement occurred in one, and four patients had no further arrhythmias requiring cardioversion once the lead was placed. The energy levels required for successful cardioversion ranged from 0.05 J to 25 J for ventricular tachycardia and from 1 J to 25 J for ventricular fibrillation. The nine successful shocks of 1 J or less did not require sedation or general anaesthesia. High energy (25 J) endocardial shocks were unsuccessful in terminating arrhythmias in two patients, one with ventricular tachycardia and the other with both ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Minor unwanted effects of endocardial shocks occurred in five patients. These were acceleration of ventricular tachycardia in two patients and complications of pacing via the special lead in three others: failure of sensing occurred in all three and one patient also had a transient rise in pacing threshold. A postmortem examination in one patient who had received three unsuccessful high energy shocks revealed localised endocardial necrosis at the site of the distal electrode. Transvenous cardioversion offers advantages over external cardioversion but at present practical difficulties limit its application to patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias that cannot readily be controlled by conventional methods.\r"

Clinically useful information was obtained in 68% of patients. Frequently, sinus rhythm had been restored by the time the patient activated the device, but the arrhythmia had been stored in the pre-event segment of the memory--a distinct advantage over many other patient-activated devices. This recorder is complementary to conventional 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring in the investigation of possible arrhythmias and is particularly suitable for patients with infrequent symptoms. Because the stored data can be rapidly analysed by any commercially available electrocardiograph the device is suitable for use in district general hospitals.\r"

Ten patients (aged 19-56) with moderate to severe isolated mitral stenosis were studied to determine whether propranolol increased their exercise tolerance. All were in sinus rhythm and free of left or right ventricular failure. Patients were trained in an individually graded bicycle or treadmill exercise protocol that provoked a reproducible degree of near maximal dyspnoea during the second three minute stage of exercise. Propranolol (80 mg or 120 mg) or matching placebo in two or three divided daily doses was given for one week in random double blind fashion. Exercise testing and questioning about subjective clinical response were carried out at the end of each week by an investigator who was unaware of the patient's heart rate. During propranolol treatment the heart rate was 19 beats/minute slower at rest and 38 beats/minute slower at peak exercise, but there was no change in mean exercise time to dyspnoea (274 s during propranolol vs 283 s during placebo). Four patients felt worse during the propranolol week, one patient felt better during the propranolol week, and five patients felt no difference between the two weeks. Propranolol did not improve objective or subjective exercise tolerance in patients with isolated mitral stenosis in sinus rhythm.\r"

Thirty nine (20%) first degree relatives had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy--37% of parents, 25% of siblings, and 8% of offspring. Eight (23%) of 35 affected relatives diagnosed by echocardiography had normal clinical and electrocardiographic findings. In the total study group 43% of the male population and 30% of the female population were affected. This difference is statistically significant. In 28/50 families there was familial occurrence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Familial occurrence was demonstrated in 17 of 18 families in which five or more family members were assessed. In 15 families the pattern of inheritance was consistent with an autosomal dominant trait; in the other 13 the affected members were identified in a single generation and the pattern of inheritance could not be determined.\r"

Examination of the diastolic openings of both atrioventricular valves was able to establish normal developments of the valves and annuli even when this was found in cases of complex congenital heart disease. In 30 patients with atrioventricular septal defects the technique distinguished between a partial defect (when the two atrioventricular valves were linked transseptally) and a complete defect (when there was only one atrioventricular valve). A range of atrioventricular attachments was seen in these patients. Short axis echocardiography from the subcostal approach reliably identifies different forms of atrioventricular septal defects by defining the anatomy of the atrioventricular valves during maximal diastolic expansion.\r"

All patients had a mirror image of type B interruption, namely a right aortic arch with reversed branching pattern and an interruption between the right common carotid and right subclavian artery. In two patients there was a doubly committed subarterial ventricular septal defect and in the two other patients there was a perimembranous septal defect. Three patients had a bicuspid aortic valve. In a consecutive series of 185 necropsies in infants and children with congenital heart disease there were no cases of interrupted right aortic arch that were not associated with DiGeorge syndrome. These observations and previous reports indicate that the concurrence of these two rare conditions is more than fortuitous. In patients with an interrupted aortic arch the clinician should be aware of the common association with DiGeorge syndrome. If the interruption is associated with a right-sided descending aorta it is highly probable that the patient has DiGeorge syndrome.\r"

Thirty patients were anaesthetized with thiopentone, nitrous oxide and halothane, and 30 patients received thiopentone, nitrous oxide and fentanyl. In all patients, the response to post-tetanic single twitch stimulation appeared before the response to TOF stimulation, and a close correlation was found between the number of post-tetanic twitches (PTC) and the time interval between the PTC and the first detectable TOF response. A PTC of zero indicated that the time to first response to TOF stimulation was always more than 8 min. A PTC of 1 meant that the TOF response would appear in, on average, 9 min (95% confidence limits: 4-14 min). Halothane significantly prolonged the time from injection of atracurium to the first response to post-tetanic single twitch stimulation. It is concluded that the relationship between PTC and the time to first response to TOF nerve stimulation makes the PTC method a valuable supplement to TOF nerve stimulation for neuromuscular monitoring during clinical anaesthesia involving atracurium.\r"

Each patient received a first dose of drug which was followed after 5 min by a second identical dose. After the first injection the ventilatory effects of meptazinol were dose-dependent and meptazinol 20 mg had an effect similar to pethidine 20 mg. Following repeated injection the effects on ventilation were markedly different between the drugs. Carbon dioxide retention and other compensatory mechanisms attenuate the ventilatory depression of meptazinol, but these may be inadequate in the anaesthetized patient.\r"

Evaluation using a linear analogue scale indicated that there were significant differences between the groups in the onset, quality and duration of pain relief, with the extradural route being superior to the i.m. route in each instance. The difference in quality of pain relief was not related to the resultant plasma meptazinol concentrations, which were similar in the two groups. Ventilatory rate was decreased equally in both groups in parallel with pain relief, but no incidence of overt respiratory depression was noted. Meptazinol produced no meaningful changes in measured cardiovascular variables, and side effects were minimal in both groups.\r"

At 240 min after intrathecal injection, most of the meptazinol had been distributed within the spinal tissue near the region of the injection, with minimal amounts reaching the brain (less than 5% of the concentrations present in the lumbar and thoracic tissue). Following i.m. administration (16 mg kg-1) peak concentrations were present in the CSF and plasma within 60 min. Appreciable concentrations persisted in the CSF up to 180 min after i.m. administration. The results would suggest that meptazinol should give rapid but short acting pain relief following intrathecal injection with minimal CNS-related side effects.\r"

Well-defined segmental analgesia developed rapidly after plain sufentanil and lasted approximately 3 h. Respiration was depressed for about the same period and was greatest in the first 2 h, as shown by a 15% increase in PECO2, while the slope and VE50 of the carbon dioxide response curve were depressed by 45% and 55%, respectively. Moderate drowsiness occurred in most subjects, while other side effects of itching, nausea and urinary retention occurred less frequently and were not severe. Addition of adrenaline 1:200,000 intensified segmental analgesia and prolonged duration to 5 h, while side effects were lessened. It is concluded that extradural sufentanil shows considerable promise for clinical use, and that the risk: benefit ratio is improved by adding adrenaline 1:200,000.\r"

P95 is the tension at which the haemoglobin would be 95% saturated and can, therefore, constitute a target tension for near-maximum arterial content of oxygen. C(a-x)O2 (the \"conditional extraction\" of oxygen) is the amount of oxygen, in ml/dl blood, which can be extracted from the arterial blood for a hypothetical mixed-venous oxygen tension PxO2. It is explained how it is possible to estimate the adequacy of tissue oxygenation by comparing any available estimate of the required extraction (normally about 5 ml dl-1) with conditional extractions calculated for three hypothetical values of PxO2 covering the clinical range. Methods of calculation are given. For accurate results at high arterial saturations, a peripheral venous sample may be required in addition to the arterial sample.\r"

Hypoxia decreased oxygen consumption in both groups, but the decrease was less in the propranolol-pretreated dogs. A second set of 16 dogs was ventilated with 10% oxygen and all animals survived. A similar, although less pronounced, effect on oxygen consumption was noted and propranolol once again lessened the hypoxia-induced decrease in oxygen consumption. With hypoxaemia, metabolic acidosis developed in all animals and the arterio-venous oxygen content difference decreased; however, propranolol lessened the acidosis and the decrease in arterio-venous oxygen content difference. We conclude that, during hypoxia, propranolol increases oxygen utilization by the tissues and this might account for better survival.\r"

This information is of importance in assessing the current risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality. The validity of maternal recall of birthweight and gestational age of 880 children born to 97 multiparas was examined by comparison with hospital records. About 75% of all reported birthweights were accurate to within 100 g and a similar proportion of reported gestational ages was correct to within 1 week. Recall was most accurate for most recent births as well as for earliest births and was not related to maternal age or education. There was a tendency for the smallness of low birthweight infants to be exaggerated by mothers. We conclude that within defined limitations, maternal recall of birthweight and gestational age of previous children is sufficiently accurate for clinical and even for epidemiological use.\r"

(1982), suggesting increased fetal cerebral blood flow during state 2F. In the umbilical artery, no significant difference in PI between the two behavioural states could be established.

The serum concentration of total cortisol was significantly higher in women with clinical malaria than in women without recorded malaria, and this is true for both nulliparae and multiparae. Free cortisol fractions did not differ significantly between these groups. Indications were obtained that higher total cortisol levels cause loss of malaria immunity rather than being concomitant with malaria infection only. The data are compatible with those of a murine malaria model.\r"

For FIGO stage IB there was no significant difference in actuarial survival between younger and older patients (P greater than 0.1), both age groups having a 5-year survival rate of 81%. Similarly for FIGO stage II there was no difference in actuarial survival (P greater than 0.1) between younger and older patients who had 5-year survival rates of 66% and 63% respectively. In our experience the incidence of invasive carcinoma of the cervix in young women is rising, but stage for stage their survival is similar to that of older women.\r"

Using the same criteria at 2-h (8 mmol/l) the agreement between these tests was 47%.

There were no significant differences in the number of conceptions or live births before or after the onset of symptoms or during the period when the disease was untreated. In only three of the 20 women who became pregnant after the onset of disease did symptoms become worse.

The examined indicators of asphyxia at birth showed slightly higher correlation coefficients with the 'neonatal neurological optimality score' (NNOS) in SGA, than in AGA term infants, but the percentage of explained variance was low, except in the 23 infants born abdominally. In this group poor neurological outcome was restricted to the 14 infants who showed signs of fetal hypoxaemia diagnosed by decelerative fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns. In 11 of them, FHR decelerations occurred antepartum. These FHR abnormalities appear to be better predictors for the neonatal neurological outcome than indicators of asphyxia at birth.\r"

Fetal losses in two instances were attributed to cervical incompetence. One baby died at 4 days of age from a complex congenital cardiac anomaly. No abnormal maternal genital or gastrointestinal bleeding was recorded. Hypertension complicated seven pregnancies. Abdominal striae developed in all patients, the severity of which correlated with weight gain and the number of pregnancies. All the women had normal gynaecological histories, none had excessive menstrual bleeding or increased episodes of menorrhagia. The eye, blood vessels and other organ systems involved in PXE were unaffected by pregnancy. Apart from the increased risk of first trimester miscarriage and the cosmetic deterioration of the abdominal skin, there are few serious complications in pregnancy in patients with PXE.\r"

All patients initially received 150 mg clomiphene citrate on days 5-9, this regimen induced sufficient stimulation in a smaller proportion of patients than the two other regimens used subsequently which included clomiphene in combination with human menopausal gonadotrophins (hMG). The fertilization rate was significantly reduced (52.4%) in oocytes collected from cycles stimulated with hMG alone (in a small sub-group of poor responders) compared with a rate of 64.1-66.4% in cycles stimulated with clomiphene alone or in combination with hMG. Embryonic development 44-48 h after insemination was significantly retarded when clomiphene alone was utilized but a higher proportion of fragmented or abnormal embryos was observed after stimulation with hMG alone. In 118 cycles embryo transfer was performed and 20 pregnancies were established, a pregnancy rate of 16.9%. All but two pregnancies were established when two or more embryos were transferred and when the embryos were at the 4-cell or later stage of development. The regimen of clomiphene in combination with 150 i.u. hMG resulted in significantly greater numbers of oocytes recovered and embryos available per patient for transfer than the other two regimens studied.\r"

A case-control study of 48 'negative' cones, 47 cones containing intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), 44 microcarcinoma containing cones and 27 occult Ib containing cones has allowed five variables to be identified which can predict the presence of dysplastic or neoplastic tissue in the cone specimen. These variables include a colposcopic suspicion of invasion; a positive or worse pre-cone smear; two severely dyskaryotic smears within a 12-month observation period, previous abnormal histology and previous treatment for CIN. Using these criteria, 44% of 'negative' cones could be avoided without overlooking any cases of microcarcinoma or occult carcinoma.\r"

In a simulation study involving intraocular pressure data analysed in this way, the null hypothesis of no difference between groups was rejected at a nominal alpha = 0.05 level in 39 out of 200 simulations; thus the true alpha was nearly 0.2. This approach is excessively prone to produce false positive results.\r"

In a further five patients there was doubt about the diagnosis. One was though to have a choroidal haemangioma but failed to respond to treatment and immunoscintigraphy was positive, suggesting a diagnosis of melanoma. Two patients were assigned a diagnosis of choroidal haemangioma, one of melanocytoma or possible retinal pigment epithelium carcinoma, and one of metastasis. Immunoscintigraphy was negative in all these four cases. In combination with established diagnostic tests immunoscintigraphy may have a part to play in differentiating uveal melanoma from other similar tumours.\r"

Human lens epithelial cells from normal and cataractous lenses were grown in culture. There was no appreciable difference in growth rate between cells from normal and those from cataractous lenses or between equatorial and central capsule cells. The cells grew from the cut edges of the capsule, suggesting that release from contact inhibition is an important factor in stimulating proliferation. The daughter cells became increasingly abnormal and metaplastic in successive generations, but there was no evidence of differentiation into fibroblasts within the 35-day culture period, suggesting that a retinal growth factor may be involved with the fibrosis occurring in opacification of the posterior capsule. A small anterior capsulotomy will release fewer cells from contact inhibition and hence reduce cell proliferation after extracapsular cataract extraction.\r"

Without prior surgical treatment the response was more variable, but 71/91 regained normal or near normal vision. Older patients, those with a family history of the condition, and those without oromandibular dystonia responded slightly better. The severity of the blepharospasm, the length of the history, and spontaneous resolution of an episode of focal dystonia in the past had no influence on the outcome. Results were poor in the presence of an associated neurological disorder. Side effects, particularly a temporary partial ptosis, were common but were well tolerated. The average duration of improvement was eight weeks in men, nine in women, and there was no evidence of any increase in duration after multiple injections. Eighty nine patients continued with injections, 11 opted for surgical treatment, and one resumed drugs.\r"

Of 108 patients with primary herpes simplex virus ocular infection (PHSV) who were followed up for two to 15 years 35 (32%) suffered one or more recurrent attacks. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients under 20 years of age, but there was no significant difference between recurrence rates in males and females. Of 35 patients with RHSV 17 (49%) had one recurrent attack, 14 (40%) had between two and five, and four (11%) had between six and 15 attacks. The mean time interval between PHSV and the first four RHSV attacks was 10 months, and was shorter in subsequent attacks. The duration and severity of RHSV were reduced in successive recurrences. Patients with more severe conjunctivitis and lid lesions during PHSV ocular infection had a higher incidence of recurrent infection. The severity of the corneal signs in PHSV had no influence on the incidence of recurrent infection. Several clinical forms of RHSV were observed. Conjunctivitis associated with lid lesions was observed in 29 (83%) patients. In six (17%) patients the disease presented as an acute follicular conjunctivitis without characteristic lid or corneal lesions. Dendritic ulcer was found in three (9%) patients, and in one of them it was associated with a disciform keratitis. A chronic blepharoconjunctivitis developed in eight (23%) patients. The epidemiological and clinical features of RHSV were compared with those of PHSV.\r"

Analysis of these 33 patients showed the following: none had significant clinical signs; x-ray findings were mainly those of micronodular miliary infiltrates; 88% were found to have cataracts; 85% were females. The frequency of cataract among patients over the age of 50 years coming to the hospital for eye problems was 26%. These figures showed a distinct relationship between desert lung and cataract in the Arabian desert. The causal relationship is not as yet clear, but 'tandoor' baking is suggested as the main factor.\r"

Nine of these subjects underwent treadmill exercise tests in order to compare the effects of nadolol and timolol on the cardiovascular system. The effects of the two treatments on blood pressure were comparable, but nadolol caused a significantly greater reduction in heart rate than timolol at rest (p less than 0.05). Nadolol reduces intraocular pressure effectively and may prove a useful alternative treatment for chronic simple glaucoma.\r"

In all but one of the 17 cases this iris atrophy was associated with glaucoma or ocular hypertension, which appeared to be secondary to the iris changes. The condition was bilateral and presented a typical slit-lamp appearance, with subtle evidence of microneovascularisation. There was neither history nor clinical evidence of previous trauma, heterochromia, or intraocular inflammation. The commonest form of iris atrophy affected the inner third of the iris stroma in a patchy manner, often with sparing above. However, diffuse atrophy occurred in two cases, and there were two cases of 'senile tears' of the iris. Some accompanying atrophy of the pigment epithelium was usual but less prominent. The changes on fluorescein angiography of the iris included the late appearance of dye with a long arteriovenous circulation time, fewer arteries than normal with sectorial hypoperfusion, leakage of dye from the pupil margin and peripupillary neovascularisation, stromal tufts, and sometimes more complex stromal microneovascularisation. An expanded prominent lesser vascular circle was a common feature of the condition. The condition is bilateral and distinct from other forms of iris atrophy. In all cases the iris changes appeared to be secondary to the vascular hypoperfusion and were not consistently associated with evidence of gross vascular disease. All patients had grey (blue) irides, and this may be an aetiological factor. The condition appears common enough to form a significant group of glaucoma patients and to be a separate clinical entity.\r"

To elucidate the mechanism(s) of this HIV-related neutropenia, we assessed the proliferative capacity of the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cell (CFU-GM) from the bone marrow (BM) of 78 patients within the AIDS spectrum manifesting symptoms or signs related to HIV infection. Of these, 70 had a significant deficit in the growth of this committed progenitor when compared with normal controls (P less than .01). Further analysis revealed that the nucleated bone marrow cells from AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients inhibited the growth of CFU-GMs from normal individuals when cocultured in agar (P less than .001). Control CFU-GMs were also inhibited when they were cultured over feeder layers containing patients' BM cells (P less than .001). Conditioned media obtained from the liquid culture of patients' BM cells did not inhibit normal control CFU-GM growth to a degree different from that of the cells themselves (P greater than .4). Analysis of these conditioned media by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed a unique glycoprotein (gp) with a mol wt of 84 kd. Further studies revealed that this gp possessed the inhibitory activity. These data suggest that this gp may be an important factor in HIV-related neutropenia. The presence of gp84 was independent of drugs administered to the patients.\r"

Washed PMNL were perfused over a monolayer of primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) pretreated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP, 1 X 10(-7) mol/L) for five minutes. In other experiments HUVEC were pretreated with interleukin 1 (IL1,2 U/mL) for four hours. PMNL adhesion to stimulated and control HUVEC was measured over a physiologic range of wall shear stresses. PMNL adhesion to nylon-coated surface was also studied. At a wall shear stress of 0.98 dynes/cm2,283 +/- 37.3 PMNL/mm2 (mean +/- SEM) adhered to FMLP-treated HUVEC while 195 +/- 20.3 PMNL/mm2 adhered to control HUVEC. At 1.96 dynes/cm2, 68 +/- 14.1 PMNL/mm2 adhered to FMLP-treated HUVEC and 42 +/- 6.0 PMNL/mm2 adhered to control HUVEC. At 3.92 dynes/cm2, virtually no PMNL adherence was noted on either control or FMLP-treated HUVEC. On IL 1-treated HUVEC at 1.96 dynes/cm2, 371 +/- 25.8 PMNL/mm2 adhered while 28 +/- 2.9 PMNL/mm2 adhered to control HUVEC. PMNL adhesion to IL 1-treated and control HUVEC dropped to 10.2 +/- 3.8 and 6.8 +/- 3.5 PMNL/mm2, respectively, at 3.01 dynes/cm2. The effect of flow on PMNL adhesion appears to be an important factor in determining the outcome of the PMNL/HUVEC adhesive interaction under these experimental conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 7 is a common abnormality in the bone marrow cells of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). This study was undertaken to characterize the chromosome breakpoints in molecular terms and to determine if hemizygosity or submicroscopic deletions occur in patients without any cytogenetically detectable abnormality of chromosome 7. We studied restriction fragment length polymorphisms with 10 chromosome 7-specific DNA probes in separated WBC fractions. No molecular abnormalities occurred in lymphocyte-derived DNA. Several probes located in band 7q22 or distally thereof detected deletion of one allele in granulocyte-derived DNA from all four patients with chromosome 7 long arm deletion. In the granulocytes of one patient heterozygosity for the T cell receptor beta chain gene (in band 7q35) indicated that the deletion was interstitial. NJ-3, a proalpha2(I)collagen gene probe (in band 7q21-22) detected heterozygosity in the granulocytes of one patient. No hemizygosity or deletions were found in four patients with two normal chromosomes 7. These results confirm that mature granulocytes but not lymphocytes are derived from the abnormal clone. Interstitial deletions exist, and the extent of deleted genomic material varies among patients.\r"

  ".W": "By cytogenetic and cytochemical analyses of individual hematopoietic colonies, we investigated clonality in progenitor compartments of primary acquired sideroblastic anemia (PASA). Two of our four subjects had reduced but countable numbers of CFU-E, BFU-E, and GFU-GM in methylcellulose culture. In one patient with cytogenetic abnormality of 47, XX, +8 in 67% of the bone marrow cells, cytogenetic analysis of individual erythroid bursts and granulocyte/macrophage colonies demonstrated two populations with and without 8 trisomy, the trisomy clone being 38% in BFU-E and 50% in CFU-GM. These findings indicate involvement of multipotent stem cells in PASA clone and mosaicism of two distinct populations in erythroid as well as granulocyte/macrophage progenitor compartments, the abnormal PASA clone and probably the normal clones. In another case with no cytogenetic abnormality, repeated iron staining showed that 31% to 40% of CFU-E and 25% to 54% of BFU-E had erythroblasts with heavy iron deposits. An ultrastructural analysis of 25 individual erythroid bursts revealed that 32% had highly dysplastic erythroblasts with marked ferruginous iron accumulation in the mitochondria. The other 68% and 15 normal bursts from a healthy control did not have noticeable dysplastic changes and iron deposits in the mitochondria. This cytochemical/ultrastructural mosaicism seems to be compatible with the cytogenetic mosaicism. However, whether the BFU-E derived from abnormal PASA clone selectively manifest iron accumulation in the mitochondria or whether the PASA clone itself shows variable degrees of abnormal iron metabolism remains to be determined by simultaneous performance of ultrastructural and cytogenetic analysis for single bursts.\r"

Platelet aggregation, but not secretion, is potentiated at low concentrations of agonists; platelet secretion is potentiated at higher concentrations of the platelet stimuli. Potentiation of platelet responses was also observed when the preincubation time with PdBu was extended to 12 minutes and also occurred in washed platelets. The potentiating effect of phorbol esters is not mediated by formation of arachidonate metabolites or by released ADP. The sensitizing effect of PdBu on platelet aggregation induced by epinephrine is unique, since in contrast to the other platelet stimuli it is also found at maximal concentrations of epinephrine and does not diminish with prolonged preincubation of platelets with PdBu. Activation of protein kinase C ranges from 20% to 80% over control after 1 to 10 minutes of platelet pretreatment with PdBu but dramatically increases after subsequent addition of a stimulus such as vasopressin. In contrast, agonist-induced myosin light chain phosphorylation is reduced after platelet pretreatment with PdBu. The results indicate that protein kinase C activation enhances platelet aggregation and dense granule secretion triggered by physiologic stimuli, although it desensitizes agonist-induced myosin light chain phosphorylation.\r"

Oxalate is a potent in vitro inhibitor of red cell lactate dehydrogenase, monophosphoglycerate mutase, and pyruvate kinase (PK). In the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate the latter inhibitory effect is competitive with phospho(enol)pyruvate (PEP). Determination of the levels of intermediate compounds in red cells incubated with oxalate suggest the presence of inhibition at the PK step, indicating that this is the site of oxalate action. Apparent inhibition at the glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase step is apparently due to an increase in the NADH/NAD ratio. Oxalate had no effect on the in vivo viability of rabbit red cells stored in CPD preservatives for 21 days. Greater understanding of the toxicity of oxalate is required before it can be considered suitable as a component of preservative media, but appreciation of the mechanism by which it affects 2,3-DPG levels may be important in design of other blood additives. Malonate, the 3-carbon dicarboxylic acid analogue of oxalate late did not inhibit pyruvate kinase nor affect 2,3-DPG levels.\r"

Eighty-four patients went into complete remission (CR), eight had a partial response (PR), three failed to respond, and five died during induction. Twenty-three patients (27%) relapsed, in two of whom a prolonged second remission was obtained. Sixty-three patients are currently alive, two of them with disease. Four patients died in CR. Median survival and median freedom from relapse survival were not reached with a median follow-up of 4 1/2 years. Characteristics negatively associated with response in multivariate analysis were: poor performance status, bone marrow involvement, and two or more extranodal sites of disease. Duration of CR was associated with splenic involvement. Three characteristics were negatively associated with survival in multivariate analysis: age, high grade subtypes, and bone marrow involvement.\r"

Electron microscopy with myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining revealed the presence of peroxidase positive cytoplasmic granules and endoplasmic reticulum in eight of the nine patients studied. Cells from the patient who was negative for MPO were also negative for platelet peroxidase. A series of monoclonal antibodies to myeloid antigens also revealed myeloid features with all patients having at least one myeloid differentiation antigen present on the surface of their cells. Common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) antigen was absent in the nine patients tested. Cytogenetic analysis of blast cells was abnormal in seven patients on whom adequately banded chromosomes were obtained although there were no consistent abnormalities. No patient had a Ph1 chromosome. Only two of the ten patients achieved a complete remission. Morphologically undifferentiated leukemia may have myeloid features when studied by transmission electron microscopy or with monoclonal antibodies for cell surface markers. Such studies should be performed when the leukemia cannot be classified using either light microscopy or lymphoid cell surface markers. Such patients infrequently achieve remission with standard therapy and constitute a distinct entity.\r"

  ".U": "88025565\r", 
  ".W": "Combination chemotherapy is frequently used in the therapy of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but late complications are rarely recognized because of the short survival of most patients. Of 119 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with cisplatin and other drugs, four patients developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). All four patients received etoposide and cisplatin with or without vindesine. Leukemia was diagnosed at 13, 19, 28, and 35 months after start of treatment. Three patients had morphologic and/or cytogenetic features of acute leukemia with significant monoblastic involvement; the fourth patient had trilineage dysplasia and cytogenetic abnormalities more commonly associated with therapy-related leukemia. Detailed analysis of the subgroup who survived longer than 1 year (24 patients) suggests that high cumulative doses of etoposide are leukemogenic; the median etoposide dose was 6,795 mg/m2 (first year only) in the four leukemic patients compared with 3,025 mg/m2 in the 20 nonleukemic patients (P less than .01). The rate of ANLL was 0.30 per person-year after the first year (95% confidence limits 0.11 to 0.90), with a cumulative risk of 15% +/- 11% at 2 years, and 44% +/- 24% at 2.5 years. We conclude that high doses of etoposide are potentially leukemogenic, and can induce a syndrome with features of acute monoblastic leukemia de novo that is distinct from other secondary leukemias.\r"

To determine its effect on platelet refractoriness, intravenous gamma globulin (IV IgG) was administered at 400 or 800 mg/kg/d for five days, and postinfusion platelet responses were monitored. Platelet transfusion responses following intravenous gamma globulin (IV IgG) were graded as follows: Excellent, 48-hour posttransfusion count greater than 50,000/microL; good, 48-hour count greater than 20,000 but less than 50,000/microL; Fair, increased increment, 48-hour count less than 20,000; and failed, no increased increment. Six of ten patients (60%) had improved responses to selected single-donor platelets (two were excellent, three were good, and one was fair). The time to achieve a platelet transfusion count greater than 25,000/microL ranged from one to nine days of IgG therapy. One individual had sustained benefit (greater than 1 year); the remaining responses persisted for 6 to 8 weeks. These results suggest that IV IgG may be useful in the management of platelet refractoriness, especially in patients receiving single-donor platelets.\r"

We investigated the role of plasma FN in platelet adhesion and platelet thrombus formation under flow conditions. We used two different perfusion models: the annular chamber with alpha-chymotrypsin-treated rabbit vessel segments, and the flat chamber with coverslips coated with fibrillar purified human collagen type III. Perfusates consisted of washed platelets and washed RBCs, suspended in normal or FN-depleted plasma. Perfusions were carried out for ten minutes at shear rates of 300 or 1,300 s-1. Platelet deposition and thrombus dimensions were evaluated morphometrically by a computerized system. We found that depletion of plasma fibronectin significantly reduced the percentage of total coverage surface and percentage of platelet thrombus, at both shear rates studied, and in both perfusion systems (P less than .01) (P less than .01). The dimensions of the platelet thrombi formed in perfusions at high shear rate were also significantly reduced in perfusions carried out with FN depleted plasma (P less than .01). Addition of purified FN to FN-depleted perfusates restored all values to those measured in the control perfusions. These results indicate that plasma FN is required for platelet aggregate and thrombus formation following adhesion under flow conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Micropipette aspiration tests on single erythrocytes have previously shown that the static rigidity (membrane shear modulus) of oxygenated sickle cells increased with increasing hemoglobin concentration, whereas the rigidity of normal cells was independent of hemoglobin concentration. Moreover, it was observed that after mechanical extension, sickle cells exhibited persistent deformation more frequently and to a greater extent than normal cells. To ascertain if differences in association of normal and sickle hemoglobin with the membrane could account for these observations, we measured rheologic properties of normal membranes reconstituted with sickle hemoglobin and sickle membranes reconstituted with normal hemoglobin. The static rigidity of normal ghosts reloaded with sickle hemoglobin was higher than those of either normal ghosts reloaded with normal hemoglobin or native normal cells. On the other hand, the increased rigidity of native sickle cells decreased to near-normal values following reconstitution with normal hemoglobin. Furthermore, we observed that normal ghosts reconstituted with sickle hemoglobin exhibited persistent bumps after mechanical extension, but no bumps formed on normal ghosts reconstituted with normal hemoglobin. Moreover residual bumps were not produced on sickle cells reloaded with normal hemoglobin. Since mechanical characteristics peculiar to sickle cells could be induced in normal cells by incorporation of sickle hemoglobin, and since normal characteristics could be restored to sickle cells by incorporation of normal hemoglobin, we suggest that the interaction of sickle hemoglobin with the cell membrane is responsible for augmented static rigidity of oxygenated sickle erythrocytes.\r"

Mice homozygous for beta-thalassemia display moderate anemia, reticulocytosis, and shortened red cell survival, whereas heterozygous carriers appear hematologically normal. Quantitative iron determination revealed that iron content and concentration in liver, spleen, and kidney, but not heart, were far higher (P less than .01) in 15-to 35-week old homozygous thalassemic mice than in age-matched normal and heterozygous controls; of these tissues, iron content increased with age only in kidneys (P = .01) of homozygous affected mice. Although plasma iron levels were only minimally elevated in homozygotes, plasma iron turnover was threefold greater (P less than .001) than that seen in heterozygote controls. Nevertheless hyperabsorption of enteric radioiron, discernible among homozygous thalassemic mice as late as 6 to 8 weeks after birth, was not observed in older mice, additionally, thalassemic and control mice at 18 to 34 weeks showed comparable iron excretion after intravenous radioiron. We conclude that adult mice with beta-thalassemia regain balanced external iron exchange, despite substantial tissue iron excess and accelerated internal iron transit.\r"

In the present study we have examined In(Lu) Lu(a-b-) erythrocytes for expression of additional epitopes on the erythrocyte 80 kilodalton protein (p80) bearing the A3D8 antigen. Using a total of seven additional MoAbs that recognize three epitopes on erythrocyte p80, we have shown that In(Lu) Lu(a-b-) erythrocytes exhibit down-regulation of expression of all three epitopes. In(Lu) erythrocytes also showed a reduction in their reactivity to rabbit antibodies produced against purified p80 from either erythrocytes or lymphocytes. Furthermore the reactivity of the MoAbs was not altered by treatment of the cells with neuraminidase but was substantially reduced by treatment of cells with trypsin or chymotrypsin. The polyclonal anti-p80 sera were shown to react with a fragment of 50,000 daltons, still associated with erythrocyte ghosts, following treatment of the cells with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Treatment of erythrocytes with the thiol-reactive reagent AET decreased their reactivity with the MoAbs but had a variable effect on their reactivity with polyclonal antibodies. Erythrocyte p80 is a glycoprotein with N-linked oligosaccharides, as demonstrated by its binding to concanavalin A (Con A) and Len culinaris lectins. Following Endoglycosidase F treatment, erythrocyte p80 underwent a reduction in apparent mol wt of 11,000. The presence of a reduced amount of an intact p80 glycoprotein, seen by a decrease in reactivity with MoAbs directed at three distinct epitopes and with two different polyclonal antibodies, suggests that the In(Lu) gene interferes with expression by erythrocytes of the entire p80 glycoprotein.\r"

The same treatment eliminated greater than 99% of clonogenic myeloma stem cell colony formation of these cell lines, with less than 20% inhibition of normal human bone marrow pleuripotent progenitor colony formation in vitro. As an experimental model to explore the efficacy of MM4 + C' in purging MM-involved bone marrow, normal marrow cells were mixed with RPMI 8226 or GM 1312 cells in the ratio of 90:10 or 50:50 (marrow:myeloma cells).

  ".W": "Two morphologically distinct types of murine megakaryocyte (MK) colonies are present after three to seven days in soft agar culture: (a) \"big-cell\" colonies composed of ten to 30 large, mature-appearing megakaryocytes and (b) \"heterogeneous\" colonies consisting of approximately 100 or more cells at various stages of differentiation. Cytochemical and immunocytochemical techniques were used to study MK maturation in colonies as well as normal mouse bone marrow. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), a specific marker for murine platelets and MK, was found in the perinuclear cisterna, endoplasmic reticulum, and occasionally, Golgi cisternae of MK in three-day big-cell colonies and immature bone marrow MK. MK in seven-day big-cell colonies and mature bone marrow MK showed additional reaction sites in the demarcation membrane system and occasional granules. In seven-day heterogeneous colonies, small cells resembled immature bone marrow MK with respect to AChE localization, whereas large cells corresponded to mature bone marrow MK. With immunogold procedures at the ultrastructural level, polyclonal antibodies against human platelet membrane glycoprotein IIIa and antimouse platelet antiserum labeled bone marrow MK and all MK from colonies grown in soft agar cultures for three to seven days. Granulocytes and macrophages in both bone marrow and soft agar cultures were negative for AChE and these immunocytochemical markers. These data indicate that the pattern of expression of AChE during maturation of MK is similar in vivo and in vitro and demonstrate, when using this marker at the fine-structural level, that a greater range of MK maturational stages is present in heterogeneous colonies than is observed in MK in big-cell colonies. Furthermore, we have confirmed that small cells in heterogeneous colonies are MK and that these colonies are composed solely of MK and their precursors.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the organization of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and the T cell receptor beta chain (T beta) gene loci in 20 ocular adnexal and four extraocular lymphoid neoplasms obtained from 18 patients presenting with an ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasm. Fifteen ocular adnexal and four extraocular lymphoid neoplasms occurring in 13 patients were classified by morphological examination and immunophenotypic analysis as monoclonal B cell lymphomas. Each one of these 19 lymphoid neoplasms exhibited clonal IgH gene rearrangements upon hybridization of EcoRI- or HindIII-digested DNA to a heavy-chain joining region (JH)-specific DNA probe. The bilateral ocular adnexal monoclonal B cell neoplasms occurring simultaneously in two individuals exhibited identical clonal IgH gene rearrangements, which indicated their derivation from an identical B cell clone. The ocular adnexal and the extraocular monoclonal B cell neoplasms occurring in two of three patients also exhibited identical clonal IgH gene rearrangements, which suggested that they too were derived from an identical B cell clone. Five ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasms were classified by morphological examination and immunophenotypic analysis as benign, polyclonal pseudolymphomas. Three of these five ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasms exhibited clonal IgH gene rearrangements, which suggested the presence of monoclonal B cell populations that escaped detection by morphological and immunophenotypic examination. None of the 24 pathological samples exhibited clonal T beta gene rearrangements upon hybridization of EcoRI- or BamHI-digested DNA to a T beta gene DNA probe. The results of these studies demonstrate the value of Southern blot hybridization analysis for clonal IgH and T beta gene rearrangements in the diagnosis, classification, and investigation of extranodal lymphoid neoplasms originating and/or presenting in the ocular adnexa.\r"

  ".U": "88025589\r", 
  ".W": "Unstirred suspensions of erythrocytes form stable spherical aggregates of uniform size. The radius of the spheres depends upon the suspending medium and the hematocrit. Erythrocyte suspensions will undergo sedimentation only after these aggregates are formed. Aggregation is a two-step process: first, erythrocytes associate in long chains (rouleau formation). Next, these chains form spheres of uniform size. The requirements for this well-defined process are an electrolyte and a neutral or negatively charged macromolecule in the solution and a metabolically active red cell. If these conditions are not met, red cells either will not aggregate at all or will form amorphous aggregates. Rouleau formation and sedimentation are inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, an inhibitor of anion transport, but not by ouabain, a cation transport inhibitor. The kinetics of erythrocyte sedimentation reflects the aforementioned mechanism: no sedimentation occurs during rouleau formation. Once the spheres of uniform size are formed, they will settle according to the Einstein-Stokes equation. In this model, parameters of sedimentation kinetics are the delay before sedimentation starts, the rate of sedimentation in the steady state, and the radius of the sedimenting aggregate. The radius can be calculated from the rate of fall of the aggregates and agrees well with the microscopically observed radius. It is inversely proportional to the hematocrit, which explains the elevated sedimentation rates in anemia.\r"

Of these, 223 had died at the time of our first contact, almost all as a result of the condition for which they were transfused. Seven had developed AIDS; five of these died, two before entry into the study and three subsequently. Forty-six additional living recipients were interviewed and evaluated. Seven had the AIDS-related complex, 18 had antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but were otherwise healthy, and 19 had no detectable anti-HIV. Two had risk factors other than transfusion. The frequency of infection of the recipient decreased as the time interval between transfusion and the diagnosis of AIDS in the donor increased. This information should be useful when counseling patients who have been transfused with blood components from donors later found to be infected with HIV.\r"

Ultrastructurally, from 34% to 50% of the microgranules showed homogeneous diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining under conditions for localizing peroxidase reactivity. The presence of myeloperoxidase (MPO) was further confirmed by biochemical and spectral analysis and immunodiffusion methods. Periodate-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate (PA-TCH-SP) intensely stained vicinal glycols in the matrix of greater than 97% microgranules in contrast to the weak or absent staining seen in larger primary granules. Directly sampled segmented neutrophils contained small DAB- and PA-TCH-SP-positive granules, which often appeared in clusters. These DAB-positive microgranules selectively remained within the cells after stimulation of exocytosis with the calcium ionophore A23187. The enriched DAB-positive microgranule fraction recovered from A23187-treated cells also contained lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase but lacked vitamin B12 binding protein activity. A similar small, DAB- and PA-TCH-SP-positive granule type was also identified in normal promyelocytes and was the predominant or only granule type observed in leukemic or preleukemic myeloid cells from four patients. This study demonstrates a unique subpopulation of MPO-containing microgranules in normal and leukemic human myeloid cells that are distinguished from (other) primary granules by their extremely low density, small size, content of complex carbohydrates, and resistance to secretion.\r"

We investigated the effects of thrombin on these glycoproteins. Monoclonal antibodies were used to assess platelet surface glycoproteins by flow cytometry, total platelet glycoprotein content by immunoassay, and glycoproteins released from platelets, also by immunoassay. Five new observations were made with regard to thrombin-induced changes in platelet membrane glycoproteins: (a) The marked decrease in platelet surface binding of antibodies directed at GPIb was not confined to antibodies directed at the von Willebrand factor binding site. (b) There was a marked decrease in platelet surface binding of an antibody directed at GPIX, with maintenance of the 1:1 ratio of platelet surface binding of antibodies directed at GPIb and GPIX. (c) Changes in platelet surface binding of antibodies were not restricted to a distinct subpopulation of platelets. (d) There was no associated platelet release of glycocalicin (a proteolytic fragment of GPIb). (e) There was no associated platelet release of the GPIIb-IIIa complex. These thrombin-induced changes may be important in modulating the reactivity of platelets with the damaged vessel wall and with each other.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma and serum from patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) can cause activation and aggregation of normal human platelets in vitro. It is possible that this platelet-activating factor contributes to the disease. In this report we describe studies designed to identify the platelet-activating factor in TTP. Platelet activation by sera from 15 patients with TTP was inhibited by leupeptin, iodoacetamide, and antipain but not by phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, and D-phenylanyl-1-prolyl-1-arginine chloromethyl ketone. These studies suggested that the platelet-activating factor in TTP serum was a cysteine protease. We confirmed that a calcium-dependent cysteine protease (CDP) was present in the sera of each of the 15 patients when we used an assay based on the ability of CDP to proteolyse platelet membrane glycoprotein 1b (GP1b) and hence to abolish the ability of CDP-treated normal platelets to agglutinate in the presence of ristocetin and von Willebrand factor. This proteolytic activity was inhibited by EDTA, leupeptin, antipain, iodoacetamide, and by N-ethyl-maleamide (NEM) but not by the serine protease inhibitors. Activity was detected in 15 of 15 patients with TTP tested before therapy was begun. In contrast, no activity was detected in the serum of any of five of the TTP patients tested in remission or in any of the sera from 36 patients with thrombocytopenia and 423 nonthrombocytopenic controls. To look for in vivo CDP activity in patients with TTP, we studied platelets from two patients with acute TTP (drawn into acid-citrate-dextrose, NEM, and leupeptin). These platelets showed a loss of GP1b from the platelet surface. Both patients were also studied in remission: GP1b on the platelet surface had returned to normal. These studies provide evidence that CDP is present in the sera of patients with TTP, that it is specific to this disease, and that is is active in vivo as well as in vitro. We postulate that a disorder of CDP homeostasis plays a major role in the pathophysiology of TTP.\r"

We assessed renal function in 51 patients with AS randomly selected from those attending routine rheumatology clinics. Five patients were found to have a definite renal abnormality and three of them underwent renal biopsy. These showed one case each of IgA glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and nonspecific tubulo-interstitial damage. A sixth patient had recurrent haematuria and borderline renal functional impairment but refused further investigation. The urinary excretion of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) was elevated in four patients; two had other biochemical evidence of renal damage while the other two patients appeared normal, although they had both received spinal irradiation in the past. The finding of a significant renal abnormality in 10% of AS patients suggests that evidence of renal involvement should be actively sought in this disease.\r"

There was no relationship between muscle inhibition and the size of effusion, pain experienced during contraction or the extent of weakness. Aspiration of joints did not reduce the amount of inhibition. Acute effusions have previously been shown to cause muscle inhibition, even when pain-free, and we suggest that the known changes in the compliance of chronically effused joints are responsible for the observed differences in the effect of acute and chronic effusions.\r"

In the majority, attenuation correction was found to make no significant difference to relative function measurement. Those in whom it did could be readily identified by inspection of the posterior DMSA images at the time of examination. Two hundred patients were reviewed in whom serial studies had been performed over the previous 5 years. Differences in relative function greater than 5% indicated a high probability that a real change in renal function had occurred. We conclude that whilst renography and DMSA scintigraphy yield complementary information, relative function (L/L + R) can be measured equally well by either method, and the results are sufficiently reproducible to be clinically useful.\r"

In one case, the splenic nodule did not take up the sulphur colloid, although it could be visualised on selective splenic scan.

At the time of referral general practitioners indicated that if open radiological access had not been available, 78% of the patients would have been referred to specialist clinics. They also indicated that with a normal initial radiological examination only 12% would need referral to a specialist department. Open access appears to save outpatient consultations.\r"

  ".W": "The practice of nuclear medicine requires integration of radiation safety with patient care and radiopharmaceutical standards. Nationally there was useful discussion in the UK before the Ionising Radiations Regulations and Approved Code of Practice were published, although such consultation had been lacking when the Medicines Act was implemented. Most of the new considerations relating to nuclear medicine stem from Schedule 6 of the Regulations. Generally, the presence of a single patient does not require a controlled area. However, when several patients are present, or radiopharmaceuticals are being prepared prior to injection, a controlled area is required. Classification of workers is not likely to be required in a typical nuclear medicine department in the UK, although most parts of the nuclear medicine department will need to be controlled areas. These include the radiopharmacy, radionuclide dispensary, injection room, and imaging rooms if patients are injected in them. The importance of finger dose measurements is emphasised. Patient wards, however, need not be controlled areas. A particular concern in nuclear medicine was that patients should not need to be admitted to hospital merely to comply with legislation. This is possibly the case and clarification will probably be available when the Notes for Guidance are published. Most procedures in nuclear medicine departments will remain unchanged. Further information is required, however, on patient waiting rooms, handling flood sources, pregnancy, and breast feeding. Within the hospital, detailed and multidisciplinary discussion will need to take place within the forum of the radiation safety committee.\r"

  ".W": "A Brantley Scott artificial sphincter has been inserted into 95 patients since 1981; more than half of the patients had lower urinary tract neuropathy and most of the others post-TUR incontinence. The main problem with the device has been cuff failure (12), which should be resolved by the new \"dipped\" cuffs. The major surgical complication has been erosion (10), usually associated with infection. Twenty-four patients had variable degrees of incontinence but the artificial sphincter remains the cornerstone of continence control when other methods have failed or are inappropriate.\r"

The rise in ASMRs, at 1.07 additional new cases per 100,000 population per year since 1970 (P = 0.0001), is attributable to significant increases in age-specific morbidity rates for males aged 45 to 54, 55 to 64, 65 to 74 and 85+ (0.5 to 15.2 additional new cases per 100,000 population per year) (P less than 0.002).

We have studied the effects of warfarin on metastasis in a rat model by intravenous injection of Mtln3 mammary carcinoma cells and subsequent counting of pulmonary seedlings. To determine whether warfarin acts principally on the tumour cells or the host, we pretreated either cells or animals with warfarin before intravenous injection of 10(4) Mtln3 cells. Pretreatment of tumour cells had no effect, whilst pretreatment of the host reduced median seedlings from 67 to 4.5 per animal (P less than 0.005). To determine whether warfarin was acting via its anticoagulant action, we reversed warfarin anticoagulation by intravenous injection of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X. Restoration of coagulation for 12 h immediately after injection of cells completely reversed the warfarin effect (P less than 0.001), but if the injection of factors was delayed for 12 h it had no effect (P = 0.1753). We conclude that warfarin acts principally on the host, not the tumour cell, and that it acts via its effect on coagulation. The restriction of the effect to the first 12 h after tumour cell injection suggests a mechanism involving intravascular processes such as tumour cell survival or endothelial adhesion.\r"

The first of these can be estimated by reference to published figures, the second can only be guessed at and the third has in the past been a matter of subjective judgement. With the aim of producing an objective assessment of the likelihood of survival, we have constructed a score system comprising 26 items including age, chronic disease and acute presenting disease. These items are each given a weight of 1 to 4 and the total fitness score for any patient ranges from 0 (fit) to 10 (unlikely to survive). We have validated this score prospectively in 1517 consecutive patients undergoing emergency or elective major abdominal operations (excluding appendicectomies and hernia repairs). In 492 operations in which the patient scored 0 or 1, one patient died (0.2 per cent); in 290 with scores of 2 or 3, one died (0.3 per cent); in 313 with scores of 4 or 5, five died (1.6 per cent). It was when the score rose to 6 or over that the chances of survival progressively declined: 16 died of the 105 patients who scored 6 (15.2 per cent) as did 74 of the 191 who scored 7 or 8 (38.7 per cent) and 70 of the 126 who scored 9 or 10 (55.6 per cent). We now use the score as part of our audit and enquire particularly closely into the death of any patient with a pre-operative score of less than 6.\r"

If surgery is to be used to maximum effect with minimum morbidity, an accurate means of predicting which patients will suffer further haemorrhage is needed. Although over 80 per cent of patients who rebleed have the endoscopic stigmata of haemorrhage, a policy of operation in all patients with stigmata would lead to a very high operation rate and a high proportion of unnecessary operations, as one-half of the patients with stigmata do not rebleed. Clinical data were collected prospectively from 278 cases of peptic ulcer haemorrhage. The data from a randomly selected 75 per cent of the cases were analysed by stepwise logistical regression. Patients who had the endoscopic stigmata of haemorrhage and who had a probability of further haemorrhage, calculated from the regression equation, of more than 0.2 were identified as a high risk group. This definition was validated using the 25 per cent of cases not used in the initial analysis. Eighty-four per cent of patients in the high risk group suffered further haemorrhage and all such patients therefore require early surgery: such a policy would have resulted in an operation rate of 28 per cent. Thirty per cent of the patients who had further haemorrhage were not identified as being at high risk but none of them had a severe rebleed. The regression equation greatly enhanced the value of stigmata in guiding surgical decision making and merits further evaluation.\r"

All patients had received pre-operative treatment with full dose H2 receptor antagonists (H2RA). Indications for surgery were: persistent relapse on withdrawal of H2RA, 107 (75.9 per cent); no response to H2RA, 30 (21.3 per cent); intolerance of H2RA, 1 (0.7 per cent); acute DU bleed, 2 (1.4 per cent); duodenal stenosis, 1 (0.7 per cent). Follow-up with a median of 47 months (24-85 months) revealed six patients (4.4 per cent) with endoscopically proven recurrence, three of whom were on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Only one patient with recurrent DU was a non-responder to H2RA pre-operatively. Twenty-five patients remained symptomatic after HSV without ulcer recurrence, of which a highly significant proportion (41 per cent) were non-responders (P less than 0.001). The pre-operative response to H2RA does not indicate the likelihood of ulcer recurrence after HSV. However, non-responders are more likely to continue with dyspeptic symptoms despite the successful healing of their ulcers. The DU recurrence rate in patients taking long-term NSAIDs is disappointingly high (33 per cent), putting the use of HSV in these patients into question.\r"

There was no operative mortality, but four patients developed temporary fistulae in the postoperative period and three patients required reoperation. Good clinical results were found when RY diversion was performed as a primary procedure or when the indication for operation was peptic ulceration. The overall results, however, were poor: 24 patients (50 per cent) felt that they had not benefited and 32 patients (67 per cent) remained in Visick grades III or IV. The main cause of failure was gastric stasis, especially of solid food. Gastric emptying studies were carried out after RY diversion in 22 patients, most of whom had symptoms of stasis. Emptying of liquids was found to be normal in most patients, but emptying of solids was delayed, the median t 1/2 for solids being 160 (75-370) min compared with 67 (50-85) min in DU patients. Bilious vomiting improved significantly after RY diversion, but 18 patients (38 per cent) complained of vomiting food and 32 patients (67 per cent) experienced postprandial distress or pain. Loss of the antral mill, vagotomy of the gastric remnant and, perhaps, resistance to gastric emptying by the Roux loop itself may together explain the delay in gastric emptying of solids after RY diversion.\r"

In order to clarify this, the cellular DNA content (ploidy) of 51 screen-detected lesions has been investigated. Cellular DNA measurements were made by static cytometry following Feulgen staining of disaggregated tissue sections and the resulting histograms classified as either diploid or aneuploid. Thirteen cases of PA and twelve of DCIS were compared with twenty-six biopsies showing DCIS with adjacent invasive carcinoma (DCIS + Ca). In the latter group, ploidy of the invasive carcinoma was compared with the associated DCIS in 16 cases. Aneuploid cells were found in approximately 30 per cent of PA and DCIS lesions but in 23 of 26 cases of DCIS + Ca. Of 16 assessable cases of co-existing DCIS and micro-invasive carcinoma both were aneuploid in 11, both diploid in 1, and in 4 cases the DCIS was aneuploid whereas the invasive carcinoma was diploid. These results suggest that aneuploidy may be of value in predicting the most biologically aggressive of these pre-invasive lesions.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of six British centres collected data on 83 patients undergoing total pancreatectomy (TP) for chronic pancreatitis between 1977 and 1986. There were 57 men and 26 women with a median age of 38 years (range 19-61 years). Half were alcoholics and half had had previous acute pancreatitis. Besides jaundice (14 per cent) severe pain was the indication for the operation; regular opiates had been needed in 82 per cent of patients and 37 per cent were addicted to these drugs. All but 12 had had previous pancreatic or biliary surgery, with a median of two operations and a maximum of six. TP was a one-stage procedure in 32 patients, 42 had had distal resections and 9 proximal resections in the past; the pylorus was preserved in 30. Median operation time was 4 h (range 2-18 h) and median blood loss was 3 units (1-21 units). Intraoperative complications in 11 patients included haemorrhage in 9. Four deaths occurred within 30 days from bleeding (2), respiratory failure (1) and Roux-loop infarction (1). All but one of the 79 survivors required full pancreatic supplementation and 38 per cent had difficulties in endocrine control. At a median follow-up of 1.5 years (range 0.25-10 years), 57 patients (72 per cent) were pain-free and 9 (11 per cent) needed only occasional analgesia. Though 13 (17 per cent) still took regular analgesics, all were symptomatically improved. There have been 10 late deaths (13 per cent), all but one of which are attributable to the operation.\r"

  ".W": "The outcome of 438 consecutive patients who had exploration of the common bile duct and/or endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) in a 5-year period was reviewed. Patients were analysed according to four groups: 59 patients had planned ES followed by surgery resulting in 14 major complications (23.7 per cent) including 3 deaths (5.1 per cent) (group 1); 248 patients had surgery alone with 21 major complications (8.5 per cent) including 10 deaths (4.0 per cent) (group 2); 114 patients with gallbladder in situ underwent ES alone with 22 major complications (19.3 per cent) including 9 deaths (7.9 per cent) (group 3); 17 patients with remote cholecystectomy also had ES alone with 3 major complications (17.6 per cent) including 3 deaths (17.6 per cent) (group 4). There was no difference in mortality between the groups. Compared with group 2, major complications were significantly higher in group 1 (chi 2 = 11.0, d.f. = 1, P less than 0.001) and in group 3 (chi 2 = 8.6, d.f. = 1, P less than 0.003). Patients in group 3, however, were significantly older than those in groups 1 and 2, and the former also had higher medical and total risk factor scores than the latter (all P less than 0.001). The results indicate that routine pre-operative ES is of questionable value. ES alone is justified in elderly high risk patients; mortality in this group might be reduced by improved management of post-ES complications.\r"

  ".W": "A review of 353 lower limb amputations over the last 7 years has been performed to assess the results of the skew flap myoplastic below-knee amputation which was introduced in April 1983 because of reported advantages in terms of wound healing and earlier ambulation. Comparing the first 3 1/2 year period with the second, the total number of amputations decreased by 31 per cent. The number of above-knee amputations remained similar in the two periods (82,62), whilst the number of Gritti-Stokes amputations fell from 79 to 21 (0.001 greater than P greater than 0.01). The proportion of below-knee (BK) amputations increased from 50 (23.7 per cent) to 59 (41.5 per cent) (0.01 greater than P greater than 0.025). The groups were comparable in terms of previous vascular surgery and co-existing medical conditions. The time to full stump healing was significantly shorter in the skew flap group compared with the earlier Burgess type BK amputation (P = 0.001), and there was a trend to fewer stump failures in the skew flap group. We therefore feel that the skew flap amputation gives superior results to the Burgess BK amputation in terms of healing and a lower complication rate, allowing a higher proportion of BK amputations to be performed. A prospective randomized trial of the two techniques is in hand to determine the accuracy of this hypothesis.\r"

Twelve patients suffered a graft thrombosis in the first month. Resting plasma fibrinolytic activity was similar in patients with thrombosed grafts and those with functioning grafts. However reduced fibrinolytic potential was found to be a risk factor for graft thrombosis in the month after surgery (P = 0.01). Other risk factors were increasing age (P = 0.007) and the indication for surgery (P = 0.03). Thirty-four patients whose grafts were functioning after 1 month were followed up for a mean of 9 months. A further eight grafts thrombosed. Neither fibrinolytic activity nor fibrinolytic potential were found to be risk factors for late graft thrombosis. Fibrinolytic potential has been shown to be an independent risk factor for early graft thrombosis. Perioperative fibrinolytic stimulation might be a method of improving femoropopliteal graft patency.\r"

This incidence was not significantly different to the limbs with healed ulceration (45 and 23 per cent respectively, chi 2 test, P = 0.10). Half volume refilling time measured by foot volumetry suggested that 79 per cent of the non-ulcerated limbs had evidence of deep vein incompetence or incompetent lower leg communicating veins, which was again similar to the incidence in the previously ulcerated limbs (85 per cent). Transcutaneous oxygen readings, expressed as a ratio of a reading at a standard site in the gaiter region of the leg over a reading from the upper arm, were significantly lower in non-ulcerated limbs (mean 0.84 +/- 0.26 s.d.) than in a cohort of age and sex matched controls (mean 1.02 +/- 0.14, Student's t test, P less than 0.001), and significantly higher than in previously ulcerated limbs (mean 0.68 +/- 0.31, P less than 0.01). Abnormalities in venous anatomy and function have been shown, in conjunction with evidence of reduced oxygen diffusion, through the gaiter skin before overt skin changes develop.\r"

  ".W": "Mucosal proctectomy with endo-anal pull-through anastomosis (MP + PTA) for ulcerative colitis reduces resting anal pressure and low RAP has been found to correlate with minor leakage of faeces or mucus. Our hypothesis was that conservative proctocolectomy with an end-to-end ileo-anal anastomosis (EEA) would result in higher anal pressure and less leakage. Twelve patients were studied after EEA and 24 after MP + PTA: each was in good health several months after operation. After EEA, maximal RAP decreased from a median 90 cmH2O (60-116 cmH2O) to 70 cmH2O (25-104 cmH2O, P less than 0.01), whereas after MP + PTA maximal RAP decreased from 85 cmH2O (70-125 cmH2O) to 40 cmH2O (22-80 cmH2O, P less than 0.003). RAP after EEA was significantly greater than RAP after MP + PTA (P less than 0.001). The pressure profile of the anal sphincter in the EEA group did not differ significantly from that of the pre-operative group at any point from 6 to 1 cm from the anal verge, and the sphincteric high pressure zone averaged 4 cm in length both before and after operation. After MP + PTA, resting anal pressure at stations 1 to 4 cm from the anal verge was significantly less than pre-operative pressure (P less than 0.001) and the sphincteric high pressure zone was only 3 cm in length compared with 4 cm before operation. Anal squeeze pressures were similar in the two groups of patients. After EEA 11 of 12 patients achieved perfect continence, day and night, whereas after MP + PTA 58 per cent of patients experienced minor faecal leakage (P less than 0.01). These findings suggest that the entire anal canal should be kept intact in the course of conservative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis.\r"

  ".W": "In a review of cases of colorectal cancer presenting to St. Mark's Hospital over the 16-year period 1970-85, 59 patients were found to have a synchronous carcinoma (3.4 per cent). Although 82 per cent of these synchronous tumours were distal to the splenic flexure (and hence within reach of a 60 cm flexible sigmoidoscope) only 42 per cent were detected pre-operatively: the remaining tumours were noted at surgery (24 per cent) or found incidentally on pathological examination of the resected specimen (34 per cent). Histological examination of these synchronous lesions revealed a high proportion with favourable stage (Dukes' A-75 per cent) and grade (well or moderate differentiation-90 per cent). Over the same 16-year period, 10 patients presented with an 'early' metachronous lesion (less than 3 years from initial surgery). Review of these cases noted negative findings on the initial barium studies in four patients and a failure to conduct full examination of the colon at initial presentation in the remaining six. It is concluded that full examination of the colon in all patients presenting with primary colorectal cancer is mandatory and that, in the light of this experience and recent reports in the literature, this should be by pre- or peroperative colonoscopy.\r"

There were 18 SM and 22 LE patients. Anal sphincter manometry and anal mucosal electrosensitivity were measured pre-operatively and 6 weeks after surgery. Postoperative pain was assessed by linear analogue scale. Anal sphincter pressures which were high pre-operatively fell to normal after surgery. Neither operation affected functional sphincter length or the recto-anal inhibitory reflex. Forty per cent of patients showed ultraslow waves on sphincter motility studies. These were associated with the highest pressures and in all but three cases disappeared after surgery. There were no differences in postoperative pain scores between the two techniques but there was a wide range from no pain to very severe pain in both groups. Submucosal haemorrhoidectomy preserved anal sensation better than ligation excision but this was not reflected in improved function. There was minor leakage and soiling in 50 per cent of patients from both groups and two SM and LE patients had initial faecal incontinence. All these symptoms had resolved by 6 weeks.\r"

A simple and effective technique is presented which gives excellent palliation without the need for tubes or stents: left intrahepatic cholangio-enteric anastomosis, using the duct of segment III (i.e. the inferolateral segment of the left liver). The procedure is performed by using the round ligament approach to the duct of segment III in the base of the umbilical fissure. A defunctioned loop of jejunum is then anastomosed to this duct. Over a period of 25 years, 48 patients with hilar cancer had this procedure in this unit. The operative mortality (death within 2 months) was 6 per cent and the complication rate was 17 per cent. Seventy-three per cent of patients had complete relief of jaundice and a further 23 per cent had partial relief. The mean survival was 9.2 months and the quality of life was excellent. These data suggest that this is a very satisfactory palliative technique for patients with hilar cancer who are not suited for radical tumour excision.\r"

The number of patients diagnosed increased from two per year before the introduction of duodenoscopy to nearly five per year afterwards. Endoscopic drainage (ED) was attempted in 21 patients with a success rate of 81 per cent. In eight cases ED was used pre-operatively and in the remainder as definitive treatment. Twenty-four patients had a Whipple's resection (12.5 per cent mortality), four patients had a local resection (no deaths), ten patients had surgical bypass (60 per cent mortality) and thirteen patients had ED alone (23 per cent mortality). The major risk factor score was significantly greater in patients undergoing surgical bypass compared with Whipple's resection. Age and risk factor scores were significantly greater in patients who had ED drainage alone than in surgical patients. The 5 year survival rate for resection was 56 per cent versus 13 per cent for drainage procedures (P less than 0.001). Survival in resection cases was directly related to the degree of tumour differentiation and a new staging system. It is proposed that all patients with ampullary tumours should have endoscopic biopsy followed by ED; Whipple's resection remains the surgical treatment of choice.\r"

If more nodes were dissected the proportion of patients with node involvement and the total number of metastatic nodes increased; conversely within R0 and R3 the extent of dissection did not affect postoperative survival. Finally when the presence and extent of node involvement was only macroscopically evaluated, the patients were classified incorrectly in 9.5 per cent of the N0 group and 20.2 per cent of the N1 group.

  ".W": "The outcome of surgery for Graves' disease in terms of early and late morbidity was studied in 161 patients undergoing subtotal thyroidectomy in the 10-year period 1976-1985. Eighty of these patients had a minimum follow-up of 5 years. There was a low operative morbidity and a zero mortality. The weight of thyroid tissue preserved (in the range 5-10 g) influenced the prevalence of hypothyroidism at one year and at five years. There was a cumulative incidence of hypothyroidism which could not be reliably predicted from biochemical results during the first year. Over 60 per cent of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism at 4 months (63 per cent) or 1 year (70 per cent) did not subsequently need thyroxine replacement within 5 years. Patients remained at risk of developing recurrent toxicity indefinitely and the risk was significantly greater in patients with small goitres (less than 50 g). Our results may be improved by leaving larger remnants (9-10 g) in most patients and smaller remnants (2-4 g) in those with small glands in whom alternative treatment, which is to be preferred, is not acceptable. After subtotal thyroidectomy for Graves' disease lifelong follow-up is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 113 patients having elective resection of the alimentary tract were studied prospectively to examine the relationship of pre-operative clinical and nutritional assessment to the development of major postoperative complications. In addition, the operating surgeon made a risk assessment on a linear analogue scale before and immediately after operation. Major complications developed in 28 patients (25 per cent). Age, weight loss and relative weight did not select high risk patients, but patients with a serum albumin of 29 g/l developed significantly more complications than those with higher levels (60 versus 22 per cent, P less than 0.05). Clinical assessment also selected some high risk patients but patients selected by the surgeon's pre-operative assessment did not develop significantly more complications than those not selected (38 versus 21 per cent). However, the surgeon's postoperative assessment did select patients at significantly increased risk, especially when compared with his pre-operative assessment. Of 38 patients who were selected pre-operatively as high risk or who increased their risk ranking postoperatively, 20 (53 per cent) developed complications, as opposed to only 6 of 65 patients (9 per cent) who were low risk or decreased their risk ranking (P less than 0.001). The surgeons changed their ranking postoperatively in 44 patients and in 36 (82 per cent) the reason given was the technical ease or difficulty of the procedure. Using receiver-operating characteristic curves, immediate postoperative assessment was superior to any pre-operative method of selecting high risk patients. Of 15 patients with normal serum albumin levels whose risk ranking increased postoperatively 6 (40 per cent) developed complications while none of the 7 patients with low serum albumin (high risk) who decreased their risk ranking developed complications. It is concluded that operative performance is the main factor in the development of postoperative complications and should be assessed in future studies of outcome.\r"

During this study, conservative heparin treatment and, when needed, delayed surgery was employed in acute limb ischaemia when the ischaemia was less severe as judged by assessment of distal motor and sensory functions, regardless of the presumed aetiology of the acute ischaemia. The results are compared with those during a preceding period, when the routine treatment was emergency thrombo-embolectomy. The emergency operation rate was reduced to 49 per cent. There were overall fewer deaths with gangrene (8 per cent versus 18 per cent). In acute arterial thrombosis, more good results were obtained (76 per cent versus 47 per cent), whereas results were unchanged in embolic cases despite the reduced emergency operation rate. This study suggests that the choice of initial treatment of patients with acute limb ischaemia may be based on the severity of the ischaemia, and that patients with less severe acute ischaemia benefit from initial conservative heparin treatment.\r"

The role of perioperative chemotherapy in prevention of recurrence has not been extensively explored. Sixteen patients with Echinoccus granulosus were treated with albendazole 10 mg kg-1 before operation; of fourteen patients who received albendazole for 1 month or more before operation only one (with doubtful therapeutic compliance) had viable protoscoleces, in contrast both of the two remaining patients who received only 1 and 3 weeks therapy had live disease at the time of operation. A 1 month pre-operative course of albendazole kills most if not all protoscoleces within hydatid cysts in man. This may allow pre-operative 'sterilization' of cysts and a reduction in the risk of recurrence.\r"

A personal series of 30 such patients operated upon between 1977 and 1984 included 16 with distal pancreatectomy, 6 with proximal pancreatectomy and 12 with total pancreatectomy; 4 patients progressed from distal to total resection after an interval of 15-28 months. The mean age was 39 years with a male preponderance of 77 per cent. The main aetiological agents were chronic alcoholism (63 per cent) and previous acute pancreatitis (23 per cent). One patient died after total pancreatectomy, giving a 30-day mortality rate for all resections of 3 per cent. Postoperative complications necessitated reoperation in 10 per cent, and there have been 5 late deaths (17 per cent). Among 27 patients followed for a median of 4.5 years, pain relief has been good in 16, fair in 8 and poor in 3 (11 per cent). Proximal pancreatectomy has proved superior to distal pancreatectomy with regard to analgesia and the avoidance of diabetes. Although technically demanding, total pancreatectomy has improved symptoms substantially in 9 of 10 patients surviving for a minimum of 18 months.\r"

The aetiology of the cysts was alcohol abuse in 35 patients, biliary diseases in 8, blunt abdominal trauma in 4, virus-induced in 2 and unknown in 5. With the exception of those who had had trauma, all patients were suffering from chronic pancreatitis. Surgical therapy included in all cases a cystojejunostomy (52 with a Roux-Y-limb and 2 with an omega loop). The mean follow-up period was 13 years (range 6 to 20 years). The late mortality was 15 per cent (8 of 52 patients). Recurrent cysts occurred in two patients (5 per cent) and relapse of pancreatitis in one third of the patients. Deterioration of carbohydrate metabolism was observed in 20 per cent of the patients. After drainage operation stool fat content became normal in 20 per cent and deteriorated in 13 per cent. Persistence or cessation of alcohol intake influenced the long-term results. From these data we conclude that both alcohol withdrawal and sufficient drainage of the pseudocyst are important factors in the prognosis of pseudocyst.\r"

This goal can be approached by selecting for treatment patients who have a real chance of survival and by reducing the duration of operations as much as possible. Should the operative time be limited to an assessed predetermined duration as proposed in certain armies? Conditions for the observation of war wounded were particularly favourable in the ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross) Hospital in Peshawar (Pakistan) because all treatments were started and completed in the same place. During the summer of 1985, a major battle took place near the Pakistan border. Analysis of 212 operated patients, of whom 68 per cent arrived at the hospital less than 48 h after the injury, showed that the operations lasted 90 min on average. Abdominal procedures were the longest. Patients stayed in the hospital for an average of 4 weeks; those with lesions of the extremities stayed longer (5.8 weeks) than those with abdominal or thoracic lesions (4.3 and 3 weeks). The results show that the long duration of an operation has not been correlated either with an unfavourable outcome or with an increased postoperative workload. As far as possible, accelerating the turnover of operations by increasing the number of operating teams should be the objective rather than the selection of patients who require short operations. Such selection would have resulted in the death of most seriously wounded patients in this series.\r"

There were 34 men and 4 women with an average age of 56.5 years. All patients had underlying hepatic disease: liver cirrhosis in 35 patients and chronic active hepatitis with fibrosis in the remaining 3. Pre-operative complications included: oesophageal varices in ten, cholelithiasis in five, peptic ulcer in two, gastric cancer in one, and severe hypersplenism in one instance. A radical resection was performed in 32 cases and palliative resection in 6. Simultaneous operations were carried out for the above mentioned associated conditions: distal splenorenal shunt in six, Hassab's devascularization procedure in one, splenectomy in one, cholecystectomy in four, cholecystolithotomy in one, and partial gastrectomy in one. Four patients had postoperative complications: liver failure, rebleeding, right haemothorax, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from acute mucosal lesion of the stomach. One patient with liver failure died in coma within 1 month. The operative and in-hospital mortality rates were 2.6 and 7.9 per cent, respectively. Survival rates during the first 4 years in 32 patients with radical hepatic resection were 89.9, 67.2, 58.8, and 58.8 per cent, respectively. We suggest that hepatic resection should be the first choice of treatment for minute HCC even in the presence of liver cirrhosis.\r"

In addition there were 107 partial hepatic resections for 89 asymptomatic small hepatocellular carcinomas. In the 225 patients undergoing major hepatic resection, the operative mortality was 8.0 per cent. In the 107 patients undergoing partial hepatic resection, the operative mortality was 5.6 per cent. Of the total of 314 hepatic resections for primary carcinoma of the liver, 309 were undertaken for hepatocellular carcinoma and the remaining 5 were carried out for cholangiocarcinoma. All hepatic resections in this series were performed with the finger fracture technique without controlling the hepatic hilar vessels, hepatic ducts or hepatic veins outside the liver, although hepatic clamping and the Pringle manoeuvre were also used in selective cases. Of 207 cases who survived major hepatic resection, 119 cases died within one year after the operation, mainly due to recurrence of cancer in the remaining residual lobe, lung metastasis or late hepatic failure. The 5 year survival rate is 18.0 per cent, 12 patients are still alive and well after more than 5 years and the longest survival is 23 years. Of the 89 patients with small asymptomatic hepatocellular carcinomas, 28 died within one to four years of surgery because of a second new growth.\r"

An analysis of 334 patients undergoing biliary tract surgery was undertaken to identify the perioperative factors associated with the development of renal impairment, and to estimate the contribution of renal failure to mortality. Thirty-eight patients (11 per cent) developed postoperative renal impairment (a two-fold increase in serum creatinine postoperatively or a rise of greater than 100 mumol/l). Ninety-three factors were examined in these and 196 control patients. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified only three factors which were significantly associated with renal impairment: postoperative sepsis (P less than 0.0005), pre-operative serum bilirubin (P less than 0.0005), and pre-operative urea (P less than 0.05). Renal impairment developed at a median 4 days after surgery and was associated with a median of two additional major postoperative complications, particularly sepsis and haemorrhage, for which 17 patients underwent reoperation. Twenty-eight (74 per cent) of the patients with renal impairment died in hospital, but in only one case was the cause of death directly related to renal failure. Twenty patients received specific therapy for renal failure, but only one of these survived. Pre-operative obstructive jaundice and postoperative infection are the major factors associated with renal impairment after biliary tract surgery. Renal impairment appears to be related to postoperative complications rather than directly to the surgical procedure itself. The development of postoperative renal impairment predicts a low chance of survival but appears to be an indicator, rather than a direct cause of a poor prognosis.\r"

Thirty-three showed one or several signs of lithiasis of the common bile duct and were treated with endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) (31 successful cases, two technical problems) followed by early cholecystectomy (33 cases). Choledocholithiasis was present in 26 cases and stones were extracted in 25 cases. Two patients (6 per cent) died. ES caused no complications. Thirty-one other patients showed no sign of choledocholithiasis and were treated by cholecystectomy with operative cholangiography. Choledocholithiasis was found in two of these patients and treated by extraction and external drainage. Five of these patients (16 per cent) died. In 30 cases acute cholecystitis was found at operation, 15 in each group. ES is therefore an efficient procedure in high-risk patients, which facilitates operation, especially in cases of acute cholecystitis, and it is recommended in all cases of complicated biliary lithiasis. Early cholecystectomy is justified for these patients by the high frequency of associated acute cholecystitis.\r"

Our aim was to study the early effects of vagotomy on fasting and postprandial gallbladder motility. A chronic model was constructed in 10 dogs to correlate gallbladder motility and emptying with interdigestive and postprandial duodenal motility both before and after selective hepatobiliary vagotomy (five dogs) and truncal vagotomy (5 dogs). During each study recordings were made for one complete interdigestive motor complex (IDMC) and for 90 min after a standard meal of (a) gallbladder and duodenal motility, (b) gallbladder emptying (by a dual radioisotope marker technique) and (c) duodenal output of bilirubin. In control studies the gallbladder contracted at the start of phase II of the interdigestive motor complex and ejected 20-25 per cent of its contents into the duodenum; after meals the gallbladder contracted within 5 min and emptied almost 80 per cent of its contents within 90 min. After both selective hepatobiliary vagotomy and also truncal vagotomy there was no significant difference in the pattern of contraction or emptying of the gallbladder either during fasting or postprandially. We conclude that gallbladder motility and emptying are entirely normal in the early period after vagal denervation.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the safety of a conservative approach to fibro-adenoma of the breast we prospectively studied 321 women with this clinical diagnosis, and performed aspiration cytology and excision biopsy. There was histological confirmation of fibro-adenoma in 217 (68 per cent), the remainder having various benign conditions and 4 (1.3 per cent) had carcinoma. Aspiration cytology had a sensitivity of 87 per cent and a specificity of 76 per cent for fibro-adenoma. Three cases of carcinoma were identified cytologically and the fourth was regarded as suspicious. To estimate the risk of missing carcinoma we compared the annual frequency of carcinoma with fibro-adenoma in young women and found a ratio of 1:470 between 15 and 19 years, 1:133 between 20 and 24 years and 1:9 in the 25-29 age group. To assess patients' views on non-operative treatment of benign breast masses we asked 124 women, 10 days postoperatively, whether they preferred a conservative approach for a cytologically benign lump: 26 (21 per cent) opted for conservative management in the future and 8 (7 per cent) would have preferred conservatism rather than their recent excision. A conservative approach is safe for clinically and cytologically benign breast lumps in women under 25 years, but very few will accept it.\r"

One of these toxins isolated from the burn eschar resulted in 80 per cent mortality when injected into non-burned mice. However, if the eschar was pretreated with cerium before isolating the toxin, the mortality in the recipients decreased. This experiment suggested that the cerium neutralized the toxin. We have partially isolated from the serum of burned patients and mice a substance that inhibits erythroid colony formation in vitro. To test if cerium neutralized this erythroid inhibitor, we applied cerium or silver nitrate to the eschar of a mouse model of thermal injury. We found that neither agent altered the level of inhibitor or any of the granulocyte or erythroid parameters measured.\r"

Burn wounds treated with silver-kaolin healed at rates comparable to untreated wounds. No significant differences were noted in the numbers or types of organisms colonizing the wounds of treated and untreated rats at 5, 12 and 19 days post-burn. To evaluate the effectiveness of silver-kaolin in treating burn wound sepsis, rats were inoculated on the wound surface with 2.5 x 10(8) Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This inoculum resulted in 100 per cent mortality in untreated rats. Rats treated with silver-kaolin had a mortality rate of 71 per cent, compared to a 9 per cent mortality rate in rats treated with 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine. When silver-kaolin was applied to the wound prior to bacterial inoculation, the mortality rate was reduced to 6 per cent. When wounds were treated with kaolin alone and then inoculated with bacteria, the mortality rate was 50 per cent, indicating that part of the effectiveness of silver-kaolin appeared to be due to a barrier effect. These results indicate that silver-kaolin may be useful for preventive topical antimicrobial therapy of acute burns or after wound debridement or excision, but is not suitable for therapy of wounds previously colonized by microorganisms.\r"

Fourteen of the patients were neonates, 102 infants, 228 were 5 years old or younger and 85 were older. Socioeconomic factors contributing to the injuries included the use of firewood for cooking at ground-level and for warming the house and body during the cold season; loose indigenous garments; thatch-roofed huts and the post-partum rituals of mud-bed heating and hot baths. Flame burns exceeded scalds with a seasonal frequency which peaked during the harmattan. In the absence of a 'burn's unit', burned children were nursed on the general ward together with other sick children by the same nursing personnel supervised by general surgeons. Complications included wound infection, respiratory distress, measles, malnutrition and tetanus. One-fifth of the patients absconded. Overall mortality was 13 per cent but 29 per cent of the neonates died. Preventive strategy should include public information, nursery school supervision, economic development and architectural improvements.\r"

With the exception of day 5 post-burn, Group 2 had significantly increased CPK levels as compared to Group 1.

Thirty-three thrombosed arterial segments (radial and/or ulnar arteries) were removed in 18 limbs and autografts of the greater saphenous or omental veins were used for the revascularization. One vascular graft, which had been sutured to the ulnar artery on day 3 post-injury, contained an anastomotic false aneurysm at the proximal anastomosis. One month after vascular grafting, this aneurysm ruptured and bled. An emergency exploration of the wrist confirmed the diagnosis and surgery successfully restored the circulation, avoiding amputation of the injured limb. Histopathological examination of the specimen was consistent with the presence of anastomotic false aneurysm. The pathogenesis of this complication is reviewed. Our experience indicates that circulation to a limb following electrical injury can be successfully restored by early vascular grafting, but emphasizes the importance of close periodical follow-up after graft acceptance due to the possibility of late anastomotic complications.\r"

All 56 were followed for at least 10 months. Of the 56, 28 had received prophylactic argon laser photocoagulation of the inactive chorioretinal lesions. The rate of activation of the lesions was similar in the treated and untreated groups (10/28 over a mean follow-up period of 44.2 months and 11/28 over a mean period of 43.2 months respectively). In the untreated group there was an increased risk of activation with a higher number of lesions (t = 2.386). In both groups the risk of activation increased with the proximity of the lesions to the centre of the fovea (chi 2 = 29.97). Of the 10 treated eyes that showed activation, 4 did so within 1 month, which suggests that prophylactic photocoagulation may not be without risk of complications.\r"

  ".W": "At the Mayo Clinic from 1972 to 1986, 15 patients (17 eyes) had intraocular hemorrhage due to neovascularization of the stromal wound years after anterior segment surgery (Swan syndrome). Months to years after surgery patients complained of low-grade blurring that was painless and transient. The hemorrhage was seen after intracapsular cataract extraction, and one third of the patients had had an intraocular lens implant. Of the 15 patients 14 were referred, 6 for vitreous hemorrhage, 5 for recurrent hyphema, 2 for amaurosis fugax and 1 for recurrent uveitis. The average time between surgery and presentation was 4 years. The initial visual acuity was better than 20/40 in 15 eyes (extremes 20/20 and hand movement), and intraocular pressure was elevated above 30 mm Hg in 2 eyes. Treatment included periodic observation (in 10 eyes), goniophotocoagulation (in 7) and limbal cryopexy (in 3). After a mean follow-up period of 3 years all 17 eyes showed normal acuity and intraocular pressure. No patient had intractable glaucoma or phthisis.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1979, 41 patients with locally advanced thyroid cancers have been prospectively treated in our institution according to a combination regimen of low-dose Adriamycin (doxorubicin) and external-beam radiation therapy. Two types of treatment regimen were used depending on tumor histologic type. Group 1 patients with well-differentiated papillary, follicular, or mixed type tumor (n = 22) received the combined regimen consisting of once weekly administration of Adriamycin (10 mg/m2) before radiation therapy (RT). Radiation therapy was carried out with a daily dose of 200 cGy for 5 days per week to a total tumor dose of 5600 cGy. Group 2 patients with anaplastic giant and spindle cell carcinoma of the thyroid (n = 19) received the combined regimen, consisting of once weekly administration of Adriamycin (10 mg/m2) before hyperfractionated RT. Radiation therapy was carried out with a fractional dose of 160 cGy per treatment twice a day for 3 days per week to a total dose of 5760 cGy in 40 days. Initial complete tumor response rates in the group 1 and 2 were 91% and 84%, respectively. Local tumor control rates at 2 years after combined therapy were 77% and 68%, respectively. The median survival time was 4 years for group 1 and 1 year for group 2. There was no disproportionately enhanced normal tissue morbidity seen with this combined approach. Patients in group 1 have a good quality of life, once the local disease is under control due to the indolent course of the disease. On the contrary, most patients in group 2 promptly developed distant metastases and died from the disease.\r"

Patients were postmenopausal or postmenopause was induced with irradiation therapy. The two treatment groups were highly similar in different patient characteristics. Of 67 evaluable patients treated with TAM, ten (15%) had a complete or partial remission, 28 (42%) had stabilized disease and 29 (43%) had progressive disease. In the 60 patients treated with NAN, the figures were ten (17%), 22 (37%) and 28 (47%) respectively. The response rates did not differ significantly. Tam was as good as NAN in osseous metastases. Four of 34 patients responded to TAM and three of 38 patients responded to NAN. NAN had a tendency for better response in the treatment of visceral metastases. Six (43%) of 14 patients responded to NAN while only three (14%) of 21 responded to TAM (P = 0.11). The median duration of remission was 24 months in the TAM arm and 17 months in NAN (insignificant). As second line treatment, NAN after TAM gave one complete remission and three partial remissions, but none responded to TAM after NAN. The side-effects of both drugs were rare and mild. These data indicate that TAM and NAN are comparable in the treatment of advanced breast cancer.\r"

Low concentrations of beta-IFN (10-100 IU/ml) produce, after a 5-day treatment, an increase in estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR). No variation of ER and PR levels is observed when beta-IFN is added directly to the cell homogenate before the assay. Our data suggest that beta-IFN could affect hormone sensitivity through a modification of ER and PR in neoplastic mammary cells.\r"

The microscopic aspects of bone invasion were investigated and were classified into three subtypes osteolytic, osteosclerotic and mixed type. The UCNT patients population was 10 years younger than that studied previously. Both the extent of the primary tumor (T) and cervical lymph node status (N) exerted an influence on the probability of metastases developing. Chemotherapy given to patients must be improved because UCNT with bone metastases is a disease with a poor prognosis.\r"

Most of the patients exhibited local symptoms evoked by growing tumor masses in the upper mediastinum without any clinical evidence of endocrine activity. Light and electron microscopic examination showed characteristic uniform large epithelial cells in polar or palisade arrangement, containing variable amounts of electron-dense secretory granules. Only a few of the tested neuropeptide antisera reacted with the investigated tumors. Cholecystokinin-immunoreactive cell populations were seen in all tumors. Expression of neurotensin could be observed in three neoplasms, two of which also exhibited ACTH immunoreactivity. Chromogranin A-immunoreactive cells were found in two neoplasms. Neuron-specific enolase showed strong staining in three tumors, one of the tumors also being immunoreactive for calcitonin. The results were confirmed by control reactions. Apart from the demonstration that conventional marker proteins are not reliable in identifying all carcinoid tumors, the present study proves that the visualization of neuropeptide-immunoreactive cells in thymus carcinoids does not necessarily correspond to the manifestation of the clinical symptoms. Furthermore, each of the investigated neoplasms, as also known from other carcinoid tumors, appears to be able to produce more than one hormone.\r"

Studies included radiographic examination, radionuclide examination, and bone marrow biopsy. Radiographs of the skeleton demonstrated metastases in 120 patients (32%), and in 40 of these patients (13%) the bone was the only site of metastases. The diagnostic efficiency was 82% for bone scanning, 80% for pain evaluation, 59% for s-calcium analyses, and 77% for s-alkaline phosphatase analyses. Bone scanning is an effective method to exclude metastatic bone disease (sensitivity: 96%). A positive scan, however, requires radiologic confirmation (specificity: 66%). Bone scanning of the skeleton should be the initial staging procedure in all patients with recurrent breast cancer with no clinical or biochemical signs of bone metastases. Bilateral posterior iliac crest bone marrow aspirations and bone biopsies were positive in 82 out of the 320 patients who underwent biopsy. The frequency of positive bone marrow biopsy was significantly correlated with both the site of radiographic metastases and with the total number of involved bone regions. Routine bone marrow biopsies are indicated in patients with a positive bone scan, but a negative x-ray examination. In these cases biopsies should be performed bilaterally.\r"

The two commonly used screening tests are flexible sigmoidoscopy and guaiac fecal occult blood testing. Both were performed simultaneously and independently on 1176 asymptomatic volunteers followed by colonoscopic examination if either occult blood or a neoplasm was detected. Neoplasia (adenomatous polyps or cancer) were found in 48 screenees. Only ten had positive stool occult blood while 45 were detected by sigmoidoscopy. Analysis of sensitivity for neoplasia was 93.8% for sigmoidoscopy but only 20.8% for the occult blood tests, while the positive predictive values for neoplasia were 100% and 23.8% respectively. The fecal occult blood test detected only 18% of screenees with adenomas and 60% with invasive cancer. Flexible sigmoidoscopy detected 95% and 80% respectively. Analysis (kappa statistic) demonstrated little agreement between the two tests (P greater than 0.05), indicating that they are diagnosing different neoplasia. Evaluation of expected gain in diagnosing neoplasia, by combining both tests, gave 18% for the fecal blood test and 94% for the endoscopic test. These results confirm the complementary value of performing both tests, but especially the high sensitivity and predictive value positive of flexible sigmoidoscopy for adenomas, including those with severe dysplasia, and the converse for the fecal occult blood test. This latter test must be recommended and used within a screening program with caution and full understanding of its limitations.\r"

Having included measures of several distinct features of pain, this study also provides a more complete understanding of the cancer patient's day-to-day pain problem than earlier investigations. The findings presented here indicate that serious pain may occur in all cancer stages, and often represents an ongoing medical problem. The data suggest that many patients may benefit from earlier and more aggressive use of available antipain treatment methods.\r"

All children with leukemia had received chemotherapy for 2 or 3 years and irradiation on standard protocols and the solid tumor group had received chemotherapy for 6 to 24 months. There was no difference between siblings and patients for dental caries, gingivitis, and oral hygiene, mouth opening, overjet, and overbite. More solid-tumor patients had abnormal occlusion (P less than 0.02) and those with abnormalities tended to have been treated at an earlier age. Enamel opacities and hypoplasia were more common in patients than siblings and in the leukemia than in the solid tumor group. Sixty-five percent of the children had abnormalities on radiologic examination including failure of the tooth to develop, small crown, hypoplasia of the crown, and abnormal root development. In most cases the radiologic abnormality could be correlated in time with the patient's treatment and a knowledge of the normal time of tooth development. Three teeth extracted during the course of the study were examined histologically and these showed prominent incremental lines which could be correlated in time with vincristine treatment.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 200 consecutive patients bearing histologically confirmed primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) were studied at University of Calabar Teaching Hospital (CTH), Calabar, Nigeria in 5 years and compared with 150 patients with metastatic hepatic carcinoma (MHC). Four hundred symptomless non-icteric nontumor-bearing individuals were noncontemporaneous controls. Sera (a total of 750) were assayed for markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). Specimens which were positive for HBsAg also were examined for hepatitis E antigen (HBeAg) and antibody (anti-HBe). The results show that PHC was associated with HBV seropositivity in 80% of patients, and postnecrotic (macronodular) cirrhosis of the liver in 90% clearly indicating a strong association between primary liver cancer and HBV infections and liver cirrhosis. The main factor associated with seropositivity among normal controls was a large number of therapeutic injections. Seropositives received over twice as many injections as seronegatives. Public health measures are urgently required to prevent parenteral transmission of HBV in Nigeria.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid microprocessor technique for measuring the cross-sectional area, diameter, and relative percentage stenosis of coronary atherosclerotic lesions by cinevideodensitometric analysis was developed and validated. Video images of projected 35-mm coronary arteriographic cine frames were analyzed from cinevideodensitometric profile curves recorded for the catheter shaft, normal artery, and stenotic segment. In radiographic phantom studies of calibrated, contrast-filled, plexiglass cylinders, cinevideodensitometric measurements correlated linearly with percentage relative stenosis (r = 0.98; SEE = 4.1%), diameter (r = 0.99; SEE = 0.12 mm), and cross-sectional area (r = 0.99; SEE = 0.32 mm2). In postmortem studies of two patients dying after coronary arteriography, cross-sectional areas of arterial segments measured by cinevideodensitometry correlated well (r = 0.99; SEE = 0.71 mm) with areas of acrylic resin casts of the coronary arteries. Intraobserver variability (r = 0.99; SEE = 2.6%) and interobserver variability (r = 0.96; SEE = 5.3%) of cinevideodensitometric measurements of coronary arteriograms were low. Additionally, percentage relative stenosis measured in the right anterior oblique projection correlated well with measurements in the left anterior oblique projection (r = 0.98; SEE = 0.11 mm2) of patients with eccentric stenotic lesions. Lastly, cinevideodensitometric measurements were significantly (p less than 0.05) more reproducible than caliper measurements. This inexpensive dedicated microprocessor system provides rapid cinevideodensitometric measurements of coronary arterial dimensions, without requiring manual tracing of arterial segments or the major expense of a main-frame computer system.\r"

This study was done to examine the reliability of this simplified formula in patients with bradycardia or tachycardia. In 68 patients with aortic stenosis, aortic valve area was calculated with both formulae, and the results were compared with one another. In the 43 individuals whose heart rates were 65 to 100 beats/min, the results of the Gorlin equation and the simplified formula showed excellent agreement (absolute percentage difference, 8 +/- 8% [mean +/- SD]). In contrast, in the 25 patients whose heart rates were less than 65 or greater than 100 beats/min, the absolute percentage difference between the results of the two formulae was 18 +/- 13% (p less than 0.001). Although the results of the two equations were especially likely to be disparate in these patients, there was no predictable relationship between them. Thus, in patients with bradycardia or tachycardia, the simplified formula should be utilized with caution and cognizance of its potential inaccuracy.\r"

The complication rates were generally lower than in published series with a mortality of 0.05%. There were no admissions for late bleeding. Ninety-seven percent of the procedures were done by the percutaneous technique utilizing 7-French catheters. Patients were heparinized, and protamine was not used. The low complication rate is to a large extent due to meticulous postoperative care by critical care nurses in an outpatient observation unit contiguous to the laboratory. Outpatient cardiac catheterization is a safe, cost-saving approach applicable to a large majority of cardiac patients.\r"

In all three cases, simultaneous catheterization was safe and aided our assessment of distal vessel contour, length of occlusion, and the intraluminal position of the wire beyond the complete obstruction. We conclude that this technique may improve success rates for dilating chronic total obstructions by allowing safer manipulation of less flexible wires.\r"

For example, a #7 French shaft has become the standard for most peripheral as well as visceral angioplasty balloons. In most instances, the shaft is unnecessarily large and not only interferes with tractability over the conventional wire but in certain situations is also unnecessarily traumatic to the vascular intima as the catheter is passed to the angioplasty site. For these reasons a newly designed catheter with a shaft measuring 1.67 mm (#5 French) has been designed to incorporate a variety of dimensional balloons varying from 2 mm through 7 mm. In addition, the open end allows passage of a .035 inch wire and consequently the balloon is ideally suited for applications from vessels as small as the tibial circulation or renal visceral or iliac circulation.\r"

Seizure durations were measured in a randomized protocol of nine possible combinations of arterial gas tension spanning increased, normal or decreased levels of PaO2 and PaCO2. Seizure duration was directly related to PaO2 (p less than 0.00001) and inversely related to PaCO2 (p less than 0.0001). A significant synergism was evident at the extremes of PaO2 and PaCO2, with seizure duration being greater than predicted for hyperoxia-hypocapnia and hypoxia-hypercapnia and shorter than predicted for hypoxia-hypocapnia and hyperoxia-hypercapnia. We conclude that arterial gas tensions strongly influence ECT-induced seizure duration and through this may influence the therapeutic efficacy of electroconvulsive therapy.\r"

All patients commenced \"continuous passive motion\" (CPM) of the operated knee after arrival in the Recovery Room. The postoperative analgesic requirement, both for intravenous fentanyl in the Recovery Room, and intramuscular and oral analgesia on the ward, was then studied. The time interval between FNB and first dose of analgesia was significantly longer in the bupivacaine group than in the control group. The bupivacaine group also required significantly less intravenous fentanyl in the Recovery Room. On the ward, there was no difference between the two groups in the total dose of intramuscular meperidine given in the first 12 hours postoperatively. We conclude that femoral nerve block is a useful adjunct in pain management after ligament reconstruction of the knee, especially in the early postoperative period, but does not decrease the total intramuscular dose of analgesia in the first 12 postoperative hours.\r"

The mean time to additional analgesic medication was approximately 207 minutes in each group. The incidence of nausea and vomiting with meperidine was 22 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 10 to 34 per cent) and with nalbuphine 20 mg the incidence was two per cent (95%CI -2 to 6 per cent).

  ".W": "The oxygen saturation in 71 healthy paediatric patients (3.5 months to 16.7 years) was measured by pulse oximetry during transfer from the operating room to the recovery room. These measurements were recorded continuously while the patients breathed room air. Of the patients studied, 28.1 per cent exhibited significant arterial desaturation of less than or equal to 90 per cent. The corresponding PO2 for this saturation level is less than or equal to 58 mmHg. In only 45 per cent of these desaturated patients was the desaturation recognized clinically by the presence of cyanosis. Age, type of anaesthetic, the use or avoidance of narcotics, and the use of controlled or spontaneous respiration had no significant relationship to the incidence of desaturation. Since more than a one quarter of all patients studied desaturated significantly, and since cyanosis can be difficult to detect clinically during the transfer period, the use of supplemental oxygen during transfer should be considered by the anaesthetist at the end of every paediatric general anaesthetic.\r"

  ".W": "A new breathing circuit (the Humphrey A.D.E., double lever model) was evaluated in adults to determine (1) the fresh gas flow (FGF) needed to achieve normocapnia during controlled ventilation and to just induce rebreathing during spontaneous ventilation, (2) end-expired CO2 (PECO2) at those FGF values, (3) the standard deviation of FGF requirements for controlled and spontaneous breathing (reliability of recommended FGF settings) and (4) the magnitude of change in PECO2 produced by varying FGF from the recommended values (sensitivity of the system). The FGFs that provided normocapnia with controlled ventilation and just induced rebreathing with spontaneous ventilation were 67 +/- 10 and 52 +/- 7 ml . kg-1 . min-1 (mean +/- SD), respectively. PECO2 values were 36.0 +/- 0.3 and 41.6 +/- 3.9 mmHg respectively. During controlled ventilation low reliability was offset by low sensitivity so that PECO2 changed little when FGF was raised or lowered from recommended values (0.2 mmHg/ml . kg-1 . min-1). In contrast, during spontaneous ventilation low reliability was additive with high sensitivity when using FGFs lower than the mean value that just induced rebreathing. A threshold was reached where lowering FGF from recommended values caused large changes in PECO2 (1.1 mmHg/ml . kg-1 . min-1). It is concluded that the FGF recommended by Humphrey for controlled ventilation is satisfactory. However, the FGF recommended by Humphrey for spontaneous ventilation may result in hypercapnia in some patients. This can be prevented either by using a higher FGF of 66 ml . kg-1 . min-1 routinely in all patients or by using lower flows with CO2 monitoring.\r"

The relationship between these factors and the effects of fatigue is explored. The current evidence for reduction in physician performance and vigilance resulting from fatigue and sleep loss is reviewed. Supplementary indirect evidence is surveyed which suggests that increased experience may not compensate adequately for this reduced performance. Since hours of work can be controlled, it is essential that anaesthetists, their professional organizations and regulatory agencies ensure that pressure for efficiency does not result in fatigue and the consequent compromise of both patient and physician health and safety.\r"

We describe the successful anaesthetic management of a 34-year-old female, using epidural anaesthesia, and pulmonary artery catheterization. Although the intraoperative and immediate postoperative courses were heralded by marked cardiorespiratory stability, refractory respiratory failure developed, and she died five months after surgery.\r"

He received droperidol 5 mg IV and metoclopramide 10 mg IV intraoperatively to prevent postoperative nausea. Postoperatively, the patient developed autonomic instability, fever and generalized muscle rigidity. His level of consciousness was depressed. These findings were consistent with the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The supportive treatment of the patient included active cooling measures, muscle relaxation and mechanical ventilation. The ability of anti-dopaminergic agents, including metoclopramide and droperidol, to precipitate the neuroleptic malignant syndrome is discussed. Treatment of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome is briefly discussed.\r"

A Puritan-Bennett Cascade I humidifier was incorporated into a circle system between the inspiratory dome one way valve and the patient. A screw which supports the thermal well to the head of the humidifier was missing, thereby allowing an intermittent leak to develop in the system. The leak was present when the system pressure dropped to ambient level; however, at positive system pressure the leak sealed. This allowed exhaled gases into the inspiratory limb of the circuit unchecked by the inspiratory valve yet when the breathing circuit was occluded at the patient end and submitted to pressures of 20 and 40 cm H2O, no leaks were detected. Intraoperatively, PaCO2 was noted to be as high as 68 mmHg just prior to removing the humidifier from the circuit and corrected to 38 mmHg within 15 minutes of removal of the humidifier.\r"
