Compared with a control group in which women were examined, told about mammography, and instructed to make an appointment for themselves, an intervention that scheduled appointments for women on the spot and followed up with a reminder postcard increased adherence at every site. Such an intervention, if implemented on a wide scale, would augment the value of screening mammography in controlling breast cancer.\r"

The most common birthing position used by the women was the semi-sitting position in the birthing bed (44%, n = 146). Ninety-four women (28%) gave birth from the conventional lithotomy position, 80 (24%) used the birthing chair, and less than 5% used a side-lying position. Almost 30% of the women gave birth with intact perineum; the incidence of episiotomy was 44%. The use of a particular position for delivery varied with parity, and multiparous women used the semi-sitting position in the birthing bed more frequently than did primiparous women. There was no statistically significant relationship between birthing position and perineal outcome for primiparous women. A statistically significant relationship between delivery position and perineal outcome was found for multiparous women. Multiparous women using the birthing bed were more likely to have less perineal trauma than women giving birth on the delivery table.\r"

For women, sex role was associated with preference for a female physician (chi 2 = 16.14, P less than .01). Women with an androgynous sex role who gave a preference always chose a female physician; three fourths of women with an undifferentiated sex role who gave a preference always chose a female physician. Regardless of sex role, men who gave a preference always chose a male physician. For women, these findings support the hypothesis that sex role is associated with preference for a female physician.\r"

  ".W": "The Department of Family Practice, College of Medicine, in partnership with the University of Illinois at Chicago, was responsible for the reorganization of the Student Health Service into a health maintenance organization (HMO), Campus Care. Historically, the two campuses of the University of Illinois at Chicago operated student health as an infirmary model. Reorganization of student health into the Campus Care HMO provided expanded health care services to students, preserved more health care dollars in the university system, and provided a nonincremental increase in the size and responsibility of the Department of Family Practice. One year's experience showed that while the capitation was low compared with standard HMOs, the variable and less frequent use of services by the student population resulted in a fiscally viable operation. Numerous transition difficulties were encountered, including the need for rapid systems conversion within a complex university system, reeducation of students as well as traditional university-based practitioners for operation in a managed care system, and the rapid expansion of a small family practice department. The positive experience of the University of Illinois at Chicago supports the notion that family practice is better suited to providing student health care than other primary care disciplines. Three issues are paramount to success: (1) approval, support, and protection by higher level administration from university territorialism, (2) a core family practice faculty with strong leadership and experience in high-volume clinical activity, and (3) a close examination of financial resources in light of expected utilization.\r"

  ".W": "A nursing home rotation can be a complementary component of geriatrics education in a family practice residency curriculum. Using nursing homes in teaching geriatrics has been done for some time but has of late received more emphasis. This increasing emphasis has been brought about by the growing health care needs of an aging population and a concomitant focus on education in geriatrics. If implementation of a nursing home rotation is contemplated, both the positive and negative aspects of such action as it relates to the residents, the nursing home, and the nursing home patients should be explored. The rotation as incorporated into the geriatrics curriculum of the Family Practice Residency, Knoxville Unit, University of Tennessee College of Medicine, involves all second-year and third-year residents in the medical care for patients of a 222-bed long-term care facility. From an educational standpoint, overall evaluation of the rotation reflects satisfaction. The experience exemplifies personal and comprehensive continuity of patient care. Other educational benefits include desensitization to the nursing home environment, understanding the kinds of medical care that can be delivered in this setting, and appreciation for the cost not only to the patient and the family but also to the medical care system as well.\r"

Six of 81 patients developed clinically significant bleomycin lung, and the DLCO predicted its development in only one patient (sensitivity, one of six patients; 16.7%). Respiratory symptoms and chest x-ray abnormalities were the earliest manifestations in the other five patients. Seventy-five of 81 patients did not develop clinically significant bleomycin lung, and 12 of these had major falls (greater than or equal to 35% pretreatment level) in DLCO (specificity, 63 of 75 patients; 84.0%). In eight patients, bleomycin was continued after a major fall in DLCO, and none developed clinically significant lung toxicity. In this study, the DLCO failed to predict the development of serious bleomycin lung toxicity in all but one case. Furthermore, in some patients, it would appear that bleomycin may be stopped inappropriately after low DLCO measurements. It is important to monitor for respiratory symptoms and chest x-ray abnormalities during bleomycin treatment as these will be the earliest signs of lung toxicity in most cases.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in sensitive relapse or incomplete first remission underwent high-dose chemoradiotherapy and anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody (MAb)-treated autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT). These patients demonstrated good performance status with a Karnofsky score of 80% or greater. The majority of these patients had one or more adverse prognostic features including a failure to achieve a complete remission (CR) with conventional combination chemotherapy (37 patients), bone marrow infiltration (69 patients), a history of extranodal disease other than bone marrow infiltration (42 patients), and histologic conversion (18 patients). At the time of ABMT, only 52 patients were in CR; however, all patients achieved a minimal disease state following conventional intensive therapy. Moreover, at the time of marrow harvest, 37 of these patients had histologic evidence of lymphoma cells infiltrating the marrow. Following high-dose ablative therapy, two acute in-hospital treatment-related deaths were observed. Two late deaths were observed, not due to recurrent lymphoma. Of the remaining 96 patients, 61 are in unmaintained CR with a median follow-up of 13 months. Kaplan-Meier actuarial analysis predicts 50% probability of disease-free survival (DFS) at 37.8 months. This very low treatment-related mortality provides the rationale to apply high-dose therapy and ABMT as consolidative therapy for patients in first remission who are at high risk for relapse following conventional therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were infused with escalating doses of monoclonal antibody (mAb) OKB7, trace-labeled with iodine-131 (131I), in order to study toxicity, pharmacology, antibody localization, and dosimetry of radioiodine. OKB7 is a noncytotoxic mouse immunoglobulin G2b (IgG2b) mAb reactive with B cells and most B-cell NHL. Three patients each were treated at six dose levels ranging from 0.1 mg to 40 mg. All patients had radionuclide imaging and counting daily, had serial blood sampling to study pharmacokinetics, human antimouse antibody (HAMA), and circulating antigen, and had a biopsy of accessible lymphoma to determine delivery of isotope to tumors and assess the effect of tumor antigen expression on mAb delivery. Bone marrow biopsies were also done in the majority of patients. There was no toxicity. Serum clearance showed a median early phase half-life of 1.9 hours and a later phase half-life of 21.7 hours. Median total body clearance half-life was 22 hours. Pharmacokinetics were not dose-related. HAMA was detected in five patients. Circulating blocking antigen was detected in the serum of four patients, but at levels that were of pharmacologic consequence only in one. Biopsied tumor tissue from five patients did not express OKB7 antigen. No significant uptake of antibody was seen in these tumor sites. Mean total uptake of isotope into lymphoma measured in biopsies correlated linearly over the 400-fold increase in injected mAb dose. However, the percent of injected dose found per gram of tumor was unrelated to dose, but correlated inversely with tumor burden. In two patients with minimal tumor burden, 1.0 mg and 5.0 mg doses of OKB7 resulted in tumor to body radioisotope dose ratios of 22 and 7, which would theoretically permit tolerable delivery of 4,400 and 1,400 rads to these tumors, respectively, if OKB7 were conjugated with higher doses of 131I.\r"

  ".W": "We report the clinical findings of 21 consecutive patients affected by mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma with sclerosis. This type of lymphoma is a recently described histopathologic entity characterized on clinical grounds by distinctive features, which, according to our series, can be summarized as follows: young age (median, 30 years; range, 15 to 42 years), prevalence of females over males (15 v six), rare occurrence of superficial lymph node enlargement (three of 21 patients), and involvement of unusual extranodal sites (kidney six, adrenal cortex two patients). The clinical course appears to be closely related to treatment. In fact, complete remission (CR) was not obtained in the six patients submitted to conventional cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP plus bleomycin (CHOP-Bleo) regimens until 1985, as opposed to 13 CRs reached in the 15 patients subsequently treated with more aggressive regimens after 1985 (methotrexate with leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin [MACOP-B], 12 patients; methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone [M-BACOD], two patients; and vincristine, cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil, cytarabine, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and prednisone [F-MACHOP], one patient; plus involved-field radiotherapy, 10 patients). Among the 13 patients who achieved a CR, only one relapse was observed at 10 months. The median overall survival of complete responders after an observation period of 11 to 69 months has not yet been reached, and the event-free survival curve indicates that 90% of patients who achieve CR may be potentially cured.\r"

Eighteen patients in first complete remission (CR1), 36 in CR2, 16 in CR3, and four in CR4 were transplanted. Patients in CR1 were transplanted 1 to 8 months (median, 3 months) after attaining CR. All 18 patients in CR1 had one or more poor risk factors: age more than 18 (N = 17), initial leukocyte count greater than or equal to 20,000 (N = 11), Ph 1 chromosome (N = 2), delay in attaining CR more than 6 weeks (N = 8), or extramedullary disease (N = 1). Of those transplanted in CR2, 72% had relapsed on therapy. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates for patients transplanted in CR1, CR2, and CR3 are 42%, 43%, and 25%, respectively, at median follow-up times of 57, 54, and 72 months, respectively. Children aged less than 18 years transplanted in CR2 have a 5-year EFS rate of 54%. All CR4 patients died early after transplant. The actuarial probability of relapse is 20%, 26%, and 48% for those transplanted in CR1, CR2, and CR3, respectively. Although there was substantial transplant-associated mortality, it decreased over the decade of the study (P = .01). This study indicates that BMT offers an attractive alternative to postremission chemotherapy in patients in CR1 with poor prognostic factors and in patients in second remission.\r"

  ".W": "A monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the cytokeratin (CK) polypeptide no. 18 specifically expressed in cells derived from simple epithelia was used to detect epithelial tumor cells in bone marrow aspirates. Of 156 patients with colorectal carcinoma, 42 presented with cells at the time of primary surgery. The incidence of positive findings varied considerably with the size and the localization of the primary tumor, the involvement of regional lymph nodes, and the presence of clinically manifest metastases. Applying a sensitive double-staining procedure, we could demonstrate that epithelial cells in bone marrow showed a heterogeneic expression of receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF-R) and transferrin (Tf-R) as well as of the proliferation-associated Ki67 antigen. Also human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I antigens differed widely in their expression on the CK-positive cells. Clinical follow-up studies on 85 patients showed a significantly higher relapse rate in patients presenting with CK-positive cells in their bone marrow at the time of primary surgery. Twenty-three patients were monitored for the presence or absence of CK-positive cells in bone marrow over time. The majority of monitored patients (18 of 23) exhibited a constant pattern of immunocytochemical findings during the time of observation. Thus, the technique may be useful in identifying high-risk patients as well as in monitoring adjuvant therapeutic trials.\r"

  ".W": "The immune function of patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and solid tumors was evaluated before and after treatment with the investigational drug 2'-deoxycoformycin (pentostatin; dCF). Thirteen HCL patients received doses of dCF of 2 to 4 mg/m2 intravenously at 2- to 6-week intervals for up to 15 courses. After completion of treatment, 12 of 13 patients had resolution of severe monocytopenia and five of nine had normal monocyte antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity. There was statistically significant depression of total lymphocytes, T cells, and B cells. Evaluation of T subsets showed a decrease in CD4+ cells. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera were decreased from baseline, while IgM and IgA were unaffected. There was no significant effect on skin-test reactivity or large granular lymphocyte numbers. Lymphoblastic transformation was variably affected. Natural-killer (NK) cell function was improved or unchanged after dCF treatment. Reevaluation of seven patients at 21 to 119 weeks after receiving dCF demonstrated that recovery to normal T- and B-cell numbers and subsets does occur. Five solid tumor patients were given dCF at 4 mg/m2 intravenously at 1- to 2-week intervals for up to five courses. There was significant reduction in T cells, B cells, CD4+, and CD8+ cells with no statistically significant effect on the other immune parameters. We conclude that low doses of dCF can cause persistent immunosuppression though recovery may occur after the drug is stopped. In patients followed after completion of dCF, there was no associated increase in second malignancies or unusual infections.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-five patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with a therapeutic vaccine (\"theraccine\") consisting of allogeneic melanoma lysates and a novel adjuvant, DETOX (Ribi ImmunoChem Research, Inc, Hamilton, MT). Each patient received 200 antigenic units (20 x 10(6) tumor cell equivalents) subcutaneously on weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Clinical responses included one complete remission, three partial remissions, and a long-term (17-month) stability. Two other patients had mixed responses, with partial remissions of numerous subcutaneous nodules. Sites of responsive disease included primarily the skin, but ileal, breast, and a liver metastasis also responded. Removal of residual lesions in patients with partial remissions, whose other lesions had disappeared during treatment, led to long disease-free survivals. The median duration of remission was 17 months, with four of the five responders alive for at least 24 months after treatment. An increase in precursors of cytolytic T cells (CTLs) correlated with clinical outcome, when complete, partial, and mixed responses and long-term stability were considered. The CTLs recognized melanoma-associated antigens on many cell lines, but not other types of tumor or normal lymphocytes. Skin-test reactivity to melanoma antigens and serum antibodies against the melanoma cells was unrelated to clinical response. Toxicity was minimal, restricted largely to minor soreness at the site of injection. Only five patients, four of whom were treated with repeated courses, developed severe granulomas. These results confirm that active-specific immunization with allogeneic lysates of melanoma administered with the adjuvant DETOX can induce immunity to melanoma, and can induce regressions of disease in a proportion of patients with metastatic disease with little toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Interferon-beta-serine (IFN-beta-ser) is a muteine, recombinant IFN that is tolerated at a dose fivefold to 10-fold higher than IFN-alfa and interacts with the same cell membrane receptor as IFN-alfa. We hypothesized that at high doses IFN-beta-ser might induce a higher response rate than IFN-alfa in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We undertook a phase II trial of IFN-beta-ser in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients were treated three times each week by a 2-hour intravenous infusion. Doses were escalated weekly (.25 to 5.5 mg, 1 mg = 180,000,000 U) until the maximum-tolerated treatment dose (MTTD) was determined. The MTTD is defined as one dose level less than that which caused grade 3 toxicity and was subsequently administered three times weekly for at least 4 weeks. Twenty-nine patients were entered, and 25 were assessable for response and toxicity. The performance status was 0-1 in all patients and only one patient received previous chemotherapy. The MTTD dose was 2.5 mg (range, 0.5 to 5.5 mg per treatment), although in 10 patients, doses were later deescalated because of cumulative toxicity. Initial dose-limiting toxicity and cumulative toxicity were fatigue, malaise, and fever in most patients. Hepatic transaminitis, neutropenia, and elevation of serum creatinine were also observed but were not dose-limiting. There was one complete response (CR) and four partial responses (PRs). All responses but one occurred in pulmonary metastases. The median time to response was 26 days (range, 17 to 102 days). These data demonstrate that IFN-beta-ser given in high doses exhibits significant antitumor activity in renal cell carcinoma; however, the objective response rate is 20%. This is no higher than previous IFN studies; therefore, we reject the hypothesis than IFN-beta-ser at high doses may induce a greater response rate than IFN-alfa. However, we did observe more responses than were seen in a similar trial undertaken with lower dose IFN-beta serine in renal cell carcinoma.\r"

In that analysis, bloods drawn from cancer patients at the Beth Israel Hospital (BIH; Boston, MA), were easily distinguished from normal subjects by measuring and averaging the proton NMR methyl and methylene line widths of plasma lipoproteins. We collected blood at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), including from normal controls, patients with untreated and treated malignant tumors, and patients with nontumor diseases. The plasma NMR analyses were carried out blind. The code was not broken until all patient charts and pathology records were reviewed, plasma analyses were completed, and patients had been divided into appropriate clinical groups. Analysis of these data showed no differences between the means of the study groups (false-positive and false-negative frequencies 46% and 57%, respectively). An inverse correlation of methyl/methylene line widths with age (P less than .01), and a correlation with nitrate-requiring cardiovascular disease (P less than .05) was, however, evident. This test cannot be validly used to detect malignancy.\r"

  ".W": "Progress in understanding rheumatoid (RA) and inflammatory arthritis has been limited in part because there has been no widely accepted animal model of naturally occurring human disease and because the clinical syndrome of RA may reflect the expression of multiple etiologies. We have considered that inflammatory joint disease may be induced and/or exacerbated by food related antigens. To facilitate our investigations, we studied inflammatory synovitis in rabbits induced by oral exposure to environmental antigens. In our preliminary experiments, we examined 9 Florida White, 30 New Zealand White, and 9 Old English rabbits. They were nourished with normal rabbit chow supplemented with either water or cow's milk beginning at age 7 to 26 weeks and observed for 81 to 204 days. Animals were then sacrificed. Histological sections of the knees were examined and graded in a blinded fashion for synovial cell hyperplasia, inflammation, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. In addition, serum levels of IgG antimilk, IgG antibovine serum albumin, IgG anticasein, and IgG-C3 complexes were quantified. We found no abnormalities among Florida White rabbits but observed histological synovitis in 53% of the milk fed New Zealand White (9/17), 40% of the water fed Old English (2/5), and all of the milk fed Old English rabbits (4/4) (p = 0.05, milk fed vs water fed animals). Milk fed animals had significantly (p less than 0.0005) greater levels of antibodies and complexes than water fed animals. Our data suggest that environmental antigens may be arthritogenic for some rabbit strains. These observations may provide an important model for the study of inflammatory joint disease analogous to oral, environmental antigen exposure in man.\r"

Thirty percent of our patients with RA alleged food related (\"allergic\") arthritis. Sixteen patients have now completed 19 double blind, controlled food challenge studies: 3 demonstrated subjective and objective rheumatic symptoms after double blind, encapsulated food challenges. The 3 were virtually asymptomatic when receiving elemental nutrition or not taking the offending foods. One was our milk sensitive patient who had increased IgG4 anti-alpha-lactalbumin, IgG-milk complexes, and delayed skin and cellular reactivity to milk; one developed inflammatory synovitis after shrimp ingestion and had increased IgG antishrimp; and another was a cardiac care unit (CCU) nurse who experienced rheumatic symptoms after exposure to nitrates. All were seronegative with palindromic symptoms and nonerosive disease. IgG, G4, A, M, and E antifood, Ig-food immune complexes, and in vitro cellular reactivity to foods were not otherwise distinctively abnormal in these or other patients with rheumatic diseases. Thus most patients alleging food induced rheumatic symptoms did not show these on blinded challenge, but some did. Probably not more than 5% of rheumatic disease patients have immunologic sensitivity to food(s). Such patients have been identified only by controlled challenge studies. These observations suggest a role for food allergy in at least some patients with rheumatic disease.\r"

Prophylactic drug effects on inflammatory cell infiltrate in synovium and joint cavity were evident only in mice treated with prednisolone (0.2-5.0 mg/kg). Treatment with diclofenac, piroxicam (both 0.5-7.5 mg/kg) or tiaprofenic acid (3-30 mg/kg) did not change these phlogistic features significantly. Striking, however, was the protective effect of piroxicam on bone apposition, a common trait in murine AIA. Among the other drugs, minor antiosteophyte effects were exerted only by prednisolone. Histological assessment was also performed on osteocyte death which was almost exclusively confined to menisci and tibial subchondral bone. Because of variability in occurrence and intensity, no clear picture emerged from drug effects on this lethal feature. Combined data from this and a previous pharmacological study, directed at chondroprotective effects, points to prednisolone as the best antiinflammatory and joint protective drug.\r"

We found that injection of the pathogenic idiotype to BALB/c females and orchiectomized males treated with estrogen caused a rapid outburst of the disease 3 months after immunization, while nonestrogen treated mice developed the disease 5 months after immunization. The flare of SLE disease was characterized by raised levels of autoantibodies in the sera to dsDNA, histones, cardiolipin, Sm, RNP, SSA (Ro), SSB (La) and an emergence of high titers of mouse antibody carrying the 16/6 Id. These enhanced antibody levels were associated with an increase in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, proteinuria and leukopenia. Immunofluorescent studies confirmed the existence of immune complexes in the afflicted kidneys. Testosterone treated BALB/c females and orchiectomized males developed a classical response to the human anti-DNA antibody (16/6 Id +), but failed to develop fulminant SLE-like disease. Our data demonstrate the importance of sex hormones on the induction of experimental SLE-like disease in mice with no genetic tendency to autoimmunity.\r"

Radiologic examination of the hips was performed in 177 of 211 patients suffering from seronegative spondyloarthropathies on whom ileocolonoscopy with biopsies of ileum and colon was performed; in 27 of these 177 patients, hip lesions were demonstrated. The concentric form seems to be radiologically, clinically and genetically more related to axial involvement; moreover, the frequency of subclinical gut inflammation was the same as in the group of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) without peripheral arthritis, and thus significantly lower than in patients with AS with peripheral arthritis. Eccentric, destructive hip lesions seem to be unrelated to axial involvement, but they are associated with the presence of HLA-Bw62 and gut inflammation (100%), mainly of the chronic, Crohn disease-like type.\r"

  ".W": "The ease with which fluid passes across the synovial lining (i.e., the lining's hydraulic conductance) is enhanced when intraarticular fluid pressure (IAP) is raised acutely to pathological levels in rabbit knees. A structural basis for this pathophysiological change was sought by morphometry of synovial sections from rabbit knees fixed in situ at less than or equal to 5 cm H2O and 25 cm H2O IAP. Light and electron microscopy showed that the main structural changes induced in areolar synovium by raising IAP to 25 cm H2O were (1) a reduction in synovial thickness to 56% control value; (2) an increase in the area of interstitium exposed at the synovial surface (3) an increased proximity of the synovial capillaries to the joint lumen, the mean distance of capillaries from the surface falling from 8.9 +/- 0.5 microns (n = 391) to 3.3 +/- 0.3 microns (n = 92: p less than 0.001). The capillary profiles showed slight compression under 25 cm H2O IAP, but no collapse. The ratio of interstitial area to thickness is the geometric factor governing hydraulic conductance. The maximum change in interstitial area/thickness was 6.8 times for the blood-joint barrier. A change of this magnitude accounts partly (but not fully) for the experimentally observed conductance changes; and it highlights the importance of capillary depth as a factor governing exchange in joints.\r"

Oligolamellar phospholipid was also observed within the subchondral matrix while lamellar bodies, phospholipid in its most surface-active state, were found in the type of canals which can result from superficial fibrillation.

There was a strong correlation between the elution patterns for newly synthesized and endogenous proteoglycans within a given hip specimen (p = 0.005). The proteoglycan elution pattern also strongly correlated when Day 1 and Day 20 explants were compared. The presence of a distinct subpopulation of hydrodynamically small proteoglycan (Kav, 0.6-0.9) correlated with a loss of both pericellular and extracellular matrix metachromasy in histologic sections of cartilage (p = 0.018).

Significantly fewer deaths were observed among this group than expected for all causes of death combined [standardized mortality ratio (SMR) = 89] compared with the number of deaths observed among the general population of U.S. white males of the same age. Excess risks for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) (SMR = 149), leukemia (SMR = 136), and pancreatic cancer (SMR = 133) were restricted to workers employed in flour mills, where pesticides are used more frequently than in other segments of the industry. In the nested case-control analysis, excess risks for developing these cancers were also observed in these workers, but the relative risk for developing NHL [odds ratio (OR) = 4.2] was approximately twice that for developing pancreatic cancer (OR = 2.2) and that for developing leukemia (OR = 1.8). Within the flour mills, the workers who had ever worked in the maintenance department (OR = 8.1) or in the elevator department (OR = 2.8) were at particularly elevated risk of developing NHL, suggesting that exposures in these departments should receive further attention.\r"

In a previous study, we demonstrated that recombinant platelet factor 4 (rPF 4) inhibited angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane. In the present study, we have extended that finding to the use of recombinant human platelet factor 4 (rHuPF 4) to inhibit solid tumor growth in the mouse. rHuPF 4 effectively suppressed the growth of the B16-F10 murine melanoma in syngeneic C57BL/6J hosts and prevented the growth of primary tumors of both B16-F10 murine melanoma and HCT 116 human colon carcinoma in semisyngeneic CByB6F1/J female athymic nude mice. These two transformed cell lines were completely insensitive to rHuPF 4 in vitro at levels (50 micrograms/mL) that extensively inhibit normal endothelial cell proliferation. The migration of human endothelial cells was also inhibited at these concentrations of rHuPF 4, suggesting a second mechanism by which rHuPF 4 may modulate capillary development. The observed antitumor effects of rHuPF 4 might be due to the inhibition of angiogenesis. This finding could have implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches to angiogenic diseases. Alternative, and possibly concurrent, mechanisms of the rHuPF 4 antitumor effect include lymphokine-activated killer cell activation and the induction of other cytokines.\r"

In a preliminary test of this method on a small series of breast tumors, ER message was found as expected in a number of tumors found to be ER positive by ligand binding assay, but also ER negative in one tumor assayed. The ER in this last tumor contained a single base change in the hormone binding region, compared with the MCF-7 breast tumor cell line ER.

  ".W": "The association between the serum selenium level and the subsequent incidence of cancer was investigated in a longitudinal study of 39,268 men and women participating in the Social Insurance Institution's Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey in Finland. The baseline examinations, including the collection of blood samples, were performed in 1968-1972. During a median follow-up of 10 years, 1,096 new cancer cases were identified from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry. Selenium concentrations were measured from the stored serum samples collected from these cancer cases and from two controls per case, matched for sex, municipality, and age. The mean serum selenium level was 59.1 micrograms/L among all male cancer cases and 62.5 micrograms/L among controls. The difference was statistically significant (P less than .001). Corresponding values among women were 63.6 and 63.9 micrograms/L, respectively. Low serum selenium levels were associated with an increased risk of developing cancer at several sites, especially cancers of the stomach and lung among men. The relative risk of lung cancer between the highest and lowest decile of serum selenium was 0.11, and it differed significantly from unity (P less than .001). These findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that low selenium intake may increase the risk of some cancers among men.\r"

  ".W": "Several studies have examined the synergism of hyperthermia or chemotherapy agents in combination with photodynamic therapy (PDT) to enhance tumor eradication. In our unique approach to treatment, multiple photosensitizers and wavelengths were used: two photosensitizers, Photofrin II and meso-tetra-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphine (TPPS4), irradiated at the appropriate therapeutic wavelength for each photosensitizer. EMT-6 mammary tumors were induced in the flanks of BALB/c mice. The mice were assigned to a control group (50 mice) or treatment group (150 mice). All treatment animals and some control animals received photosensitizing drug (5 mg/kg of TPPS4, 5 mg/kg of Photofrin II, or 2.5 mg/kg of both TPPS4 and Photofrin II). All treatment animals and some control animals also received light treatment (630 nm for TPPS4 and/or 658 nm for Photofrin II). The results show that the approach using both drugs and the corresponding therapeutic wavelengths enhanced the effectiveness of PDT. This approach achieved a cure rate of up to 100%, which was, depending on the light intensity used, as much as 40% greater than the rate achieved by the approach using one drug and one wavelength. The results also show that lesser amounts of drug and/or light may be required if both drugs and wavelengths are used, thus lowering the chances of side effects common to PDT. Furthermore, the results indicate that the increased tumor kill is due to a synergistic effect of the two photosensitizers that was tested on the tumor microvasculature in the first few hours after PDT.\r"

(1) Are there additive antihypertensive benefits with exercise and drug therapy combined? (2) Does drug therapy limit exercise-induced lipid improvements? (3) Does exercise that includes weight training and walking/jogging affect the left ventricle? Fifty-two hypertensive men were randomly assigned, double-blind, to diltiazem hydrochloride, sustained release (360 mg daily), propranolol hydrochloride (240 mg daily), or placebo and exercised three times per week for 10 weeks. Baseline blood pressure (145/97 mm Hg) fell after training (131/84 mm Hg) in all groups. Exercise decreased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in all groups. Increases in the levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar in placebo and diltiazem groups, whereas the propranolol group changed in an opposite direction. In all groups, left ventricular mass increased with training, while diastolic function was unchanged. We conclude that (1) drug therapy provided no additive benefit to the antihypertensive effects of exercise, (2) propranolol limited improvements in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and (3) exercise did not adversely affect the left ventricle.\r"

Results of routine endocrine testing showed partial hypopituitarism in 5 patients and growth hormone hypersecretion without signs and symptoms of acromegaly in 1 patient. Four patients underwent neurosurgery. Histologically, one chondroid chordoma and three pituitary adenomas were found. In the remaining 14 patients treated conservatively, repeated computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed no significant change in tumor size at the time of follow-up (median, 22 months).

  ".W": "The primary goal of mass screening programs for cystic fibrosis carriers should be to allow people to make more informed reproductive decisions. However, previous experience with genetic screening programs, including those for phenylketonuria and sickle cell disease, have revealed complex problems including error, confusion, and stigmatization. These problems could be greater with cystic fibrosis, since more than 8 million Americans may be carriers and entrepreneurial interests can be expected to promote screening in what could become a billion-dollar industry. The present frequency of the detectable mutation (delta F508), 75%, will complicate the counseling process. The sensitivity of the test to detect at-risk couples would be 56%. The cost of screening could be as much as $2.2 million for each cystic fibrosis birth avoided. Regardless of improvements in the detection rate, implementation of population screening should be delayed until pilot studies that demonstrate its safety and effectiveness are completed. While studies are in progress, preconception testing should be offered to adult relatives of cystic fibrosis patients as part of a comprehensive program following institutional review board approval for \"compassionate use.\" The purpose of such review should be to ensure that strict standards of informed consent, education, quality control of the testing procedure, and counseling are followed. Primary care physicians who are unable to offer screening as part of such a comprehensive program should refer high-risk patients who would like to consider being tested to established centers.\r"

Approximately 3% of tobacco industry profits ($221 million in 1988) derive directly from the sale of cigarettes to children, an activity that is illegal in 43 states. Approximately half of the tobacco industry's profits, or $3.35 billion annually, derives from sales to people who became addicted to nicotine as children. Tax revenues to the federal ($152 million) and state ($173 million) governments from cigarette sales to children dwarf governmental expenditures on smoking and health.

  ".W": "A histologic and immunocytochemical study of 69 autopsy-obtained pituitaries from women who died during pregnancy, after abortion, or in the postpartum period revealed an accumulation of large chromophobic to slightly acidophilic and periodic acid-Schiff-negative pregnancy cells that were immunoreactive for prolactin but not for other pituitary hormones. This increase in the number of prolactin cells was confirmed by cell counts. Thus, pregnancy cells are capable of prolactin production. The finding of mitotic figures in such cells supports the view that they arise by multiplication from preexisting prolactin cells. With use of \"mirror section\" techniques, no mammosomatotrophs (cells immunoreactive for growth hormone and prolactin) were identified. Hyperplasia of prolactin cells was evident at 1 month of pregnancy and gradually disappeared within several months after delivery or abortion; the process of involution seemed to be retarded in the one lactating patient investigated. In some pituitaries, the accumulation of prolactin cells was so extensive that the hyperplastic foci resembled microadenomas. Another striking change in the pituitaries of pregnant women was appreciable reduction of immunostaining of gonadotropic cells, a process that was reversible as soon as 1 month after delivery. Among the 69 pituitaries studied, 8 noninvasive microadenomas (12%) were encountered (7 contained prolactin only and 1 was plurihormonal). Prolactin-producing adenomas were no more numerous or larger than were similar tumors encountered in nonpregnant women or normal men; thus, pregnancy neither initiates formation of pituitary adenomas nor accelerates their growth. In the pituitaries that harbored prolactin-producing adenomas, massive pregnancy cell hyperplasia was evident outside the tumor; thus, prolactin production by adenoma cells did not seem to suppress the proliferation of prolactin-containing pregnancy cells.\r"

Major advances have been made in organ preservation. Currently, pancreas allografts can routinely be stored for 18 to 24 hours. The technique of pancreaticoduodenal transplantation with a duodenocystostomy for the exocrine drainage is widely used. Experience with anesthetic and intensive-care unit management of these patients is accumulating. With the evolution of pancreas transplantation and with the help of the excellent transplant centers in our area, we developed a pancreas transplantation protocol and performed transplantation based on this protocol in 16 recipients at the Mayo Clinic from October 1987 through December 1988.\r"

Our immunosuppressive regimen was quadruple therapy with induction by using Minnesota antilymphoblastic globulin. A biopsy technique was instituted in which the pancreas specimens were obtained under cystoscopic direction during episodes of hypoamylasuria. The criteria for rejection episodes were not only biochemical abnormalities but also histologic confirmation and a follow-up to exclude other causes of graft dysfunction. Infectious disease management included use of oral selective bowel decontamination for 3 weeks after transplantation. At the Mayo Clinic between October 1987 and December 1988, 16 patients received pancreaticoduodenal allografts (both kidney and pancreas in 13 and pancreas only in 3 after a prior successful kidney transplantation). In two pancreas and one kidney allograft, function was lost. One patient died of multiorgan failure. The cystoscopically directed biopsy technique was performed 23 times with minimal complications and a 93% success rate. The metabolic results have been excellent; the glycosylated hemoglobulin level was normal 3 to 6 months after transplantation. The quality of life was significantly improved in almost all patients. Nutritional assessment revealed little deterioration after transplantation. With a multidisciplinary approach, the needed answers about the effect of pancreas transplantation on the degenerative complications of diabetes should be forthcoming.\r"

Bronchial washing demonstrated lipid-laden pulmonary alveolar macrophages. After the use of Lacri-Lube was discontinued, her cough and the chest roentgenographic abnormality totally disappeared. We postulate that the topical ophthalmic preparation, which contains mineral oil and petrolatum, drained into the nasopharynx, trachea, and bronchial tree through the nasolacrimal duct and caused lipoid pneumonitis from aspiration of the oil contents. To our knowledge, this is the first report of pulmonary complications caused by Lacri-Lube. We briefly review the pulmonary complications, including pulmonary edema, apnea from paralysis of respiratory muscles, bronchospasm from non-beta-adrenergic blocking drugs, and electrolyte abnormalities, attributable to topically and systemically administered ophthalmic medications.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade, the general acceptance of the primary role of thrombosis in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has led to intense interest in the potential efficacy of reperfusion therapy, particularly thrombolytic therapy, in AMI. Accumulating evidence indicates that systemic thrombolytic therapy administered early after the onset of symptoms of AMI can restore infarct-related artery patency, salvage myocardium, and reduce mortality. Recommendations about the proper use of thrombolytic therapy, contraindications, and concomitant therapies (such as aspirin, heparin, nitrates, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, and calcium channel blockers) are reviewed. Although percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is useful for subsets of patients with AMI (for example, patients with anterior infarctions with persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery after thrombolytic therapy and those with cardiogenic shock), a conservative strategy, including angiography and PTCA only for postinfarction ischemia, is indicated for most patients with AMI in whom initial thrombolytic therapy is apparently successful. The use of PTCA after failed thrombolysis or as direct therapy for AMI seems promising, although further comparisons of PTCA and intravenous thrombolytic therapy are needed. Ongoing studies should help further define the risk-to-benefit ratio of various reperfusion strategies in different subsets of patients, define time limitations for reperfusion therapy, and provide data on therapeutic modalities that will limit reperfusion injury and therefore enhance salvage of myocardium.\r"

Two patients also required common femoral artery endarterectomy to improve inflow. Laser recanalization was successful in 9 patients (53%), and 8 (47%) had relief symptoms. None of the 4 patients with tibial and peroneal artery occlusion had successful recanalization or limb salvage. Restenosis or reocclusion developed in 4 patients during the first year after successful recanalization, but only 1 had recurrent symptoms. Limb salvage was initially achieved in 5 of 8 recanalization failures by surgical reconstruction but 3 developed graft infections requiring graft removal in 2 and amputation in 1.

At 3 months, occlusions, probably thrombotic in origin, had occurred in 5 of the carotid arteries and none of the femoral arteries. Histologically, laser-induced coagulation of the arterial wall with loss of cellular elements was demonstrated. Collagen and elastic fibers remained relatively intact. In two carotid arteries intimal proliferation was observed at the treated site. Thus, this technique appears to be technically feasible, yet further study is needed to assess its potential to reduce or repair acute vascular complications (dissections) and to reduce restenoses after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). However, the clinical value of this technique appears to be limited in view of the thromboses and reactive proliferations observed in this preliminary study.\r"

  ".W": "The temperature developed by the laser thermal (\"hot tip\") probe during arterial recanalisation is primarily dependent on the rate of energy delivery and the rate of dissipation to the surrounding medium. While higher probe tip temperatures enhance the efficacy of atheroma ablation, so too is the incidence of adverse effects increased. We studied the temperature developed in the probe tip in an artificial circulation using both saline and blood. In saline the peak probe temperatures were limited to 100 degrees C (boiling point), falling with each increment in flow. Small discrepancies in probes at different times and may be due to malalignment of the optical fibre-metal cap coupling, temperature measurement inaccuracy, tip insulation, or generator output instability. In blood, charring and clot formation insulated the tip raising the temperature (up to 700 degrees C within 5 seconds at 10 W) but also retarded dissipation of heat to the surroundings. The degree of clot and char formation was critical in determining subsequent thermal responses in any particular probe. The unknown rate and quantity of char buildup and changing blood flow during in vivo angioplasty are likely to be important obstacles to developing a reliable thermal feedback control system.\r"

To determine the influence of Nd: YAG laser coagulation of myocardium on coronary vessels, a total of 48 transcatheter laser impacts (10 W, 10 sec, 7 W mm2) were directed to the left ventricular free wall via endocardial (24 lesions in 2 dogs) or epicardial (24 lesions in 2 dogs) approach. In 8 of 24 endomyocardial lesions (2 and 6 months old) coronary vessels with a diameter of greater than 50 microns were found within the coagulation zones. The volume of these lesions was significantly (P less than 0.01) smaller (139 +/- 43 mm3) than those (n = 16) with coronary vessels measuring less than 50 microns (311 +/- 87 mm3). Volumes of epimyocardial lesions (1-2 hours old) produced by transcoronary irradiation with normal coronary blood flow were significantly (P less than 0.01) smaller (31 +/- 17 mm3) than with reduced (73 +/- 22) or interrupted (119 +/- 34 mm3) blood flow (n = 8, each). Both directly irradiated coronary vessels and those found within the coagulation zones and scars appeared histologically normal through all layers with an intact intima without fibrosis or thrombosis. The ultrastructure of irradiated arteries, even with total interruption of blood flow, was no different from that of non-irradiated controls. Thus, coronary artery blood flow significantly reduces the volume of coagulated myocardium, whereas the vessels themselves appear to remain undamaged by laser irradiation as used for myocardial coagulation.\r"

We report the feasibility of percutaneous transcatheter laser balloon ablation of left-sided accessory pathways from the coronary sinus using a 1,064-nm, continuous wave Nd:YAG laser triple lumen catheter with an optical fiber terminating in a cylindrical diffusing tip within a 2-cm-long, 3-mm-diameter balloon transparent to Nd:YAG laser radiation. In eight mongrel dogs (18 to 31 kg), the laser balloon catheter was positioned via an 8 French guide catheter in the distal and proximal coronary sinus. During balloon inflation, two to three consecutive laser doses of 30 W x 20 sec were applied to each site (cumulative energy, 1,200 to 1,800 J). Coronary angiography, left ventriculography, and coronary sinus injection were performed before and after laser exposure. After percutaneous transcatheter laser balloon ablation, there was no evidence of mitral regurgitation, left circumflex artery, coronary sinus obstruction, or perforation. Coagulation necrosis and/or polymorphonuclear infiltrates involving the atrioventricular groove and left atrial wall over a mean length of 17 mm were present in all eight dogs sacrificed 6 +/- 1 hr postablation. In conclusion, percutaneous transcatheter laser balloon ablation from the coronary sinus is free of immediate major complications and may be feasible for potential interruption of left-sided accessory pathways.\r"

  ".W": "The thermal response of white fibrous atheromatous plaque to argon laser irradiation was compared with the thermal response of yellow fatty plaque and normal aortic wall to the same type of radiation. Samples of normal aorta, fibrous, and fatty plaque were irradiated in air with 3.5 Watts of laser power on a 2 mm spot for 5 and 10 seconds. Heterogeneous foci, each covering normal aorta and either fibrous or fatty plaque, were additionally irradiated with 7 Watts on a 1 cm spot for 30 seconds to 2.5 minutes. Tissue surface temperature was monitored during laser irradiation via a 3-5 micron infrared camera. For the 2 mm spot and 5 second exposure time, argon laser irradiation of normal aorta produced popping and surface tearing at a peak temperature of 145 +/- 10 degrees C. Irradiation of fatty plaque produced popping and crater formation at a peak temperature of 200 +/- 10 degrees C. However, fibrous plaque was nonablatively discolored by the same dose of laser radiation with a peak temperature of only 85 +/- 10 degrees C. Irradiation for 10 seconds caused crater formation and carbonization in the fatty plaque but failed to produce ablation in the fibrous plaque. Irradiation of the heterogeneous foci confirmed the disparity in the temperature attained by these two types of plaque and their degree of damage. Therefore, this study suggests that the ablation threshold for soft atheroma is strongly dependent on the optical properties of the particular type of tissue. Yellow fatty plaque preferentially absorbs argon laser radiation, but white fibrous plaque absorbs this radiation less readily than normal aortic wall.\r"

Two levels of wounds were made (shallow and deep). Each group consisted of five guinea pigs with one consistent level of wounding. Four treatment methods were applied: carbon dioxide laser, argon laser, overgrafting, and dermabrasion. The results were evaluated by trained observers on a gross basis. Although no statistically significant differences were found within these small groups, clinical experience in a small group of patients suggests that carbon dioxide laser may prove to be useful in the delayed treatment of traumatic tattoos. Eight patients have been treated over a 4-year period. Satisfactory total or subtotal foreign body removal of various agents (road tar, cement, cooper particles) has been achieved.\r"

The clonogenic survival rates showed a saturation level approaching a 99.8% survival rate for large volumes (above 1,900 mm3), possibly indicating poor light utilization of 630 nm because of the limited tissue penetration and/or tumor hypoxia. With a small tumor volume [less than 150 mm3], the survival rate (less than 0.3%) showed an exponential increase with volume. The survival rates (less than 0.03%) corresponding to a volume lower than 50 mm3 gave complete tumor eradication. On the other hand, partial response and recurrence were noticed with volumes larger than 90 mm3, which had more than approximately 0.1% survival rates. After PDT, all tumors responded with immediate swelling and skin discoloration, followed by necrosis, tumor delay, and regrowth. Regrowth rate and tumor cell doubling time were slower than the control growths and decreased further following superficial irradiation with a second interstitial illumination. The regrowth rates were slow for small initial tumor volumes and fast for large initial tumor volumes. Also, the delay period was longer for the small initial tumor volumes in comparison to a shorter period for the medium tumor volumes and very low probability of delay for the large volumes.\r"

Both lasers offer the ability of delivering the beams through a quartz fiberoptic alone or simultaneously. This study examines the efficacy of the simultaneous administration of PDT and selective hyperthermia at 44.5 degrees C in tumor control in the spontaneous mammary tumor (SMT-F) in DBA mice. Hyperthermia alone (44.5 degrees C, 30 min) resulted in complete destruction of tumors, with no subsequent regrowth in 6.6% of the mice treated. PDT alone (5 mg/kg dihematoporphyrin ether; 135 J/cm) resulted in a cure rate of approximately 10%, and the simultaneous treatment of the modalities resulted in a 32.8% cure rate after 90 days. These values are indicative of a synergistic interaction.\r"

A continuous 5-watt wave of power was applied over periods ranging from 46 to 92 seconds to produce the tissue blanching and shrinkage that indicated a satisfactory tissue weld. Integrity, degree of tissue reaction, and bursting pressures of the anastomoses were compared to those of anastomoses constructed using standard sutured techniques. The results of the two methods were equivalent at 1 to 3 days, but the laser-fused enteric anastomoses showed less inflammatory reaction and greater bursting pressures at 7 and 14 days. Application of a variety of proteinaceous solutions including extracellular matrix materials and epidermal growth factors prior to lasing failed to augment wound healing. We conclude that lasers show promise as reconstructive, in addition to ablative, surgical instruments.\r"

Traditionally electrocoagulation has been the method used for epilation when intraluminal hair has become a problem, such as interfering with flow, being foci for recurring urinary tract infection, or acting as a nidus for calculus formation. Electrocautery is also used at the time of grafting in an attempt to prevent the growth of hair when hair-bearing skin is utilized. Unfortunately, because of lack of penetration, the hair follicles are not destroyed and the epilating procedure fails or is only partially successful. The neodymium: YAG (Nd:YAG) surgical laser can photocoagulate tissue to a depth up to 5.0 mm and thus has the ability to destroy hair follicles. We report three cases presenting with clinical problems directly related to hair-bearing urethral grafts successfully treated by Nd:YAG epilation.\r"

The animals were killed at different postoperative time intervals, ranging from 1 day to 8 weeks. Injection of methylene-blue into the testicular ducts of the resected prostate-bladder specimen and histologic studies of the coagulated tissue revealed that complete bilateral occlusion of the ejaculatory ducts had been achieved in 4 rams. Failures were due to over-extended irradiation of the verumontanum. Except for urinary tract infections occurring in 4 animals, no serious complications were encountered. Further investigations are still necessary to determine the role of lasers in male sterilization.\r"

A, B and AB individuals express glycosyltransferase activities converting the H antigen into A or B antigens, whereas O(H) individuals lack such activity. Here we present a molecular basis for the ABO genotypes. The A and B genes differ in a few single-base substitutions, changing four amino-acid residues that may cause differences in A and B transferase specificity. A critical single-base deletion was found in the O gene, which results in an entirely different, inactive protein incapable of modifying the H antigen.\r"

Constitutive binding of various other cell types to ECM components is mediated by members of the VLA (very late antigen) subfamily of integrins. We describe here the regulated binding of resting CD4+ human T cells to ECM through three VLA integrins: VLA-4 and VLA-5 binding to fibronectin (FN), and a novel pathway of VLA-6 binding to laminin (LN). Binding to ECM is regulated in two ways. First, unlike other VLA-mediated interactions, VLA binding activity of the T cells is rapidly and dramatically augmented with cell activation without change in level of expression of the VLA molecules. Second, binding is regulated with T-cell differentiation; memory T cells express three- to four-fold more VLA-4, VLA-5, and VLA-6 than do naive cells, and bind more efficiently through them to FN and LN.\r"

The rapid Ca2(+)-triggered fusion of synaptic vesicles is presumably mediated by specific proteins that must interact with Ca2+ and the phospholipid bilayer. We now report that the cytoplasmic domain of p65, a synaptic vesicle-specific protein that binds calmodulin contains an internally repeated sequence that is homologous to the regulatory C2-region of protein kinase C (PKC). The cytoplasmic domain of recombinant p65 binds acidic phospholipids with a specificity indicating an interaction of p65 with the hydrophobic core as well as the headgroups of the phospholipids. The binding specificity resembles PKC, except that p65 also binds calmodulin, placing the C2-regions in a context of potential Ca2(+)-regulation that is different from PKC. This is a novel homology between a cellular protein and the regulatory domain of protein kinase C. The structure and properties of p65 suggest that it may have a role in mediating membrane interactions during synaptic vesicle exocytosis.\r"

Both microtubule dynamics and microtubule-dependent motors have been proposed as the source of these motor forces. Cytoplasmic dynein and kinesin are two soluble proteins that power membranous organelle movements on microtubules. Kinesin directs movement of organelles to the 'plus' end of microtubules, and is found at the mitotic spindle in sea urchin embryos, but not in mammalian cells. Cytoplasmic dynein translocates organelles to the 'minus' end of microtubules, and is composed of two heavy chains and several light chains. We report here that monoclonal antibodies to two of these subunits and to another polypeptide that associates with dynein localize the protein to the mitotic spindle and to the kinetochores of isolated chromosomes, suggesting that cytoplasmic dynein is important in powering movements of the spindle and chromosomes in dividing cells.\r"

In recent years, several characters, particularly ultrastructural ones, have been used to define a green algal group (Charophyceae) from which land plants are thought to have arisen. Here we provide the first molecular genetic evidence in support of the charophycean origin of land plants. Group II introns have previously been found in both the tRNAAla and tRNAIle genes of all land plant chloroplast DNAs examined, whereas all algae and eubacteria examined have uninterrupted genes. The distribution of these introns in Coleochaete, Nitella and Spirogyra, members of the Charophyceae, confirms that these taxa are part of the lineage that gave rise to land plants. Furthermore, the intron data place Coleochaete and Nitella closer to land plants than Spirogyra. These introns were most probably acquired by the chloroplast genome more than 400-500 million years ago, the time of land plant origin.\r"

The surgical development of a distinct labial periosteal flap by both a subperiosteal and supraperiosteal dissection allows a two-layered lapped closure of the mucosal and periosteal flaps. Fourteen patients were treated with this technique and have been observed for period of 8 to 40 months. Arch form was dramatically improved in all cases. Observation of panoramic radiographs disclosed an average initial increase in ridge height of 11.8 mm in the midline and 7.6 mm in the first premolar regions. During the first 6 months, consolidation of the ridge occurred, but the diminution in ridge height never exceeded 15%.\r"

After initial examination, the patients received an intensive individual hygiene treatment. The patients continued using the most appropriate, atraumatic method resulting in the best possible oral hygiene over a 1 year period during which they were seen for follow-up examinations at 3-month intervals. The mean plaque scores decreased after the initial treatment followed by an increase. The mean scores for severity of subjective symptoms and for type and extension of lesions initially decreased with the plaque scores and remained lower throughout the study. It is concluded that in some cases both subjective and objective improvement of atrophic and ulcerative gingival lichen planus may be obtained by means of intensive oral hygiene procedures although such procedures do not remove the basic cause of lichen planus. However, further studies are needed to examine the role of dental plaque control in patients with oral lichen planus.\r"

Case 2 involved a 19-year-old female patient with a lesion of the right mandible that was monitored for 2 years and 9 months. In both cases, intraosseous biopsy or other surgical procedures were not undertaken. By the time both patients approached age 22, their lesions had resolved and the trabecular bone pattern radiographically approached normal.\r"

Positive immunostaining of epithelioid and spindle cells for S-100 protein and neuron-specific enolase was also indicative of their nevocellular nature. Review of the cases of Spitz nevus from the literature revealed that the present case most probably represents the first reported instance of this type of nevus in the oral cavity.\r"

During early embryogenesis a 6.8-kilobase (kb) RNA is transcribed and processed to yield 1.7- and 2.0-kb poly(A)+ RNAs. These RNAs are expressed from the time of cellular blastoderm formation to germ-band shortening and are localized in parasegments 8-14 (the posterior second through the anterior ninth abdominal segments). Sequence analysis of the two RNAs suggests that they may not be translated.

The amplified DNA was compared with standardized DNA concentrations; 0.1-1 ng of fetal DNA was obtained in the 20-ml maternal samples. In 7/19 cases, a 222-bp band of amplified DNA was detected, consistent with the presence of male DNA in the isolated cells; 6/7 of these were confirmed as male pregnancies by karyotyping amniocytes. In the case of the female fetus, DNA prepared from samples at 32 weeks of gestation and cord blood at delivery also showed the presence of the Y chromosomal sequence, suggesting Y sequence mosaicism or translocation. In 10/12 cases where the 222-bp band was absent, the fetuses were female. Thus, we were successful in detecting the Y chromosomal sequence in 75% of the male-bearing pregnancies, demonstrating that it is possible to isolate fetal gene sequences from cells in maternal blood. Further refinement in methodology should increase sensitivity and facilitate noninvasive screening for fetal gene mutations.\r"

  ".W": "We previously demonstrated, in transgenic tobacco plants, that the role of the movement protein (MP) of tobacco mosaic virus is to facilitate the cell-to-cell spread of viral progeny during infection. An analysis of different tissues of these transgenic plants indicated that the MP accumulated in leaf, stem, and root tissue. The highest levels were detected in older leaves. The relative levels of MP in leaf tissue from transgenic plants were equivalent to, or higher than, the levels of MP in tobacco mosaic virus-infected leaf tissue. Results of subcellular fractionation of homogenates of transgenic leaf tissue showed that the MP was most abundant in the cell wall fraction of older leaves and that the protein remained at high levels in the cell wall fraction as the leaves continued to age. Significant levels of the MP were detected in a crude membrane/organelle fraction and a soluble fraction in younger leaves but decreased to low levels in older leaves. These results suggest that the MP accumulates and is stable in cell walls. We have previously shown that the MP modifies the molecular exclusion limit of plasmodesmata, which is consistent with the hypothesis that plant viruses move from cell to cell through altered plasmodesmata. We show here that the ability of the tobacco mosaic virus MP to modify the molecular exclusion limit of plasmodesmata in tobacco depends on the developmental stage of the leaf. The implications of these findings on understanding virus movement and how plasmodesmata function are discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90238999\r", 
  ".W": "The precursor for transforming growth factor alpha, pro-TGF-alpha, is a cell surface glycoprotein that can establish contact with epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors on adjacent cells. To examine whether the pro-TGF-alpha/EGF receptor pair can simultaneously mediate cell adhesion and promote cell proliferation, we have expressed pro-TGF-alpha in a bone marrow stromal cell line. Expression of pro-TGF-alpha allows these cells to support long-term attachment of an EGF/interleukin-3-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line that expresses EGF receptors but is unable to adhere to normal stroma. This interaction is inhibited by soluble EGF receptor ligands. Further, the hematopoietic progenitor cells replicate their DNA while they are attached to the stromal cell layer and become foci of sustained cell proliferation. Thus, pro-TGF-alpha and the EGF receptor can function as mediators of intercellular adhesion and this interaction may promote a mitogenic response. We propose the term \"juxtacrine\" to designate this form of stimulation between adjacent cells.\r"

These receptors are biologically active because cAMP levels decreased in lung cancer cells after opioid and nicotine application. Nicotine at concentrations (approximately 100 nM) found in the blood of smokers had no effect on in vitro lung cancer cell growth, whereas mu, delta, and kappa opioid agonists at low concentrations (1-100 nM) inhibited lung cancer growth in vitro. We also found that lung cancer cells expressed various combinations of immunoreactive opioid peptides (beta-endorphin, enkephalin, or dynorphin), suggesting the participation of opioids in a negative autocrine loop or tumor-suppressing system. Due to the almost universal exposure of patients with lung cancer to nicotine, we tested whether nicotine affected the response of lung cancer cell growth to opioids and found that nicotine at concentrations of 100-200 nM partially or totally reversed opioid-induced growth inhibition in 9/14 lung cancer cell lines. These in vitro results for lung cancer cells suggest that opioids could function as part of a \"tumor suppressor\" system and that nicotine can function to circumvent this system in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.\r"

CGRP was shown to increase both cell number and DNA synthesis, whereas NKA, NPY, and VIP were ineffective. 125I-labeled CGRP was shown to bind to HUVECs and this binding was displaced by addition of unlabeled CGRP, suggesting the existence of specific CGRP receptors. The effect of CGRP on formation of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) and inositol phosphates (InsP), two intracellular messengers known to be involved in regulation of cell proliferation, was investigated. CGRP stimulated cAMP formation but was without effect on the formation of InsP. Proliferation, as well as cAMP formation, was also stimulated by cholera toxin. Basic fibroblast growth factor stimulated growth without affecting cAMP or InsP formation, whereas thrombin, which increased InsP formation, did not stimulate proliferation. We thus suggest that CGRP may act as a local factor stimulating proliferation of endothelial cells; that the mechanism of action is associated with cAMP formation; and that this effect of CGRP may be important for formation of new vessels during physiological and pathophysiological events such as ischemia, inflammation, and wound healing.\r"

It also was prevented by prostacyclin, which is known to inhibit the phospholipase C-induced formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol, which is one of the endogenous activators of protein kinase C. On sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 42-kDa protein that is ADP-ribosylated by alpha-thrombin was clearly distinct from the alpha subunits of membrane-bound inhibitory and stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins, respectively Gi alpha and Gs alpha; the 47-kDa protein that is phophorylated by protein kinase C in platelets; and the 39-kDa protein that has been shown to be endogenously ADP-ribosylated by agents that release nitric oxide. This information shows that agonist-induced activation of protein kinase leads to the ADP-ribosylation of a specific protein. This covalent modification might have a functional role in platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "Blood B cells from eight patients with clonal lymphoid disorders characterized by monoclonal IgM secretion (four with malignant plasmacytic proliferation typical of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and four without overt lymphoid neoplasia) were found to spontaneously differentiate in vitro into plasma cells. In all instances, monoclonal plasma cells (8-45% of the cells) were generated from extensively purified B cells or T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells after a 7-day culture period, with a corresponding high rate of IgM secretion into the culture medium. This differentiation occurred in the absence of any cell proliferation process as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake at day 2 or 4. Normal B cells did not differentiate under the same experimental conditions. Detection of interleukin 6 (IL-6) bioactivity in all patients' B-cell culture supernatants as well as of IL-6 mRNA in freshly prepared, uncultured B cells in the two cases studied by in situ hybridization suggested that IL-6 secretion by B cells may play a role in this process. Moreover, in the four patients without overt lymphoid proliferation, B-cell differentiation was significantly inhibited (60-80%) in the presence of anti-IL-6 antibodies. In contrast, anti-IL-6 antibodies did not preclude the differentiation into plasma cells of B cells from the four patients with bona fide Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia. These results suggest a two-step pathogenesis for such human lymphoplasmacytic clonal proliferations, the initial stage being characterized by an IL-6-dependent autocrine differentiation pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The CD3 eta subunit of the T-cell antigen receptor forms a heterodimeric structure with the CD3 zeta subunit in thymus-derived lymphoid cells and is apparently involved in signal transduction through the receptor. Here we report the primary structure of murine CD3 eta as deduced from protein microsequencing and cDNA cloning. The mature protein is divided into three domains: a 9-amino acid extracellular segment, a 21-amino acid transmembrane segment including a negatively charged residue characteristic of CD3 subunits, and a 155-amino acid cytoplasmic tail. The NH2-terminal sequences of CD3 eta and CD3 zeta are identical through amino acid 122 of each mature protein but then diverge in the remainder of their respective COOH-terminal regions, consistent with alternatively spliced products of a common gene. The cytoplasmic domain of CD3 eta is 42 amino acids larger than that of CD3 zeta but lacks one of six potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites as well as a putative nucleotide binding site previously identified in CD3 zeta. These structural features presumably account for the difference between CD3 eta and CD3 zeta function and are consistent with the notion that CD3 eta may be an important component of a T-cell receptor isoform(s) during thymic development.\r"

Human tumor cell lines selected for resistance to cisplatin showed more efficient DNA repair and increased expression of XPE binding factor. These results suggest that XPE binding factor may be responsible, at least in part, for the development of cisplatin resistance in human tumors and that the mechanism may be increased DNA repair.\r"

A high percentage of antibody-producing B cells was detected, but antibody reactivity was generally lost during culture expansion. Two cultures, however, remained stable for antibody productivity and one was used to develop a stable hybrid line with mouse myeloma. The monoclonal antibody (designated 3-207) derived from patient VS has dual specificity for GM2 and GD2, despite the fact that only GM2 antibody could be detected in the patient's serum. Monoclonal antibody 3-207 shows high-titered reactivity with a range of melanoma, astrocytoma, neuroblastoma, and leukemia cell lines, cells with prominent cell surface expression of GM2 and GD2. The cell surface reactivity of monoclonal antibody 3-207 was not abolished by treatment of target cells with neuraminidase, as the enzyme converted GD2 to GM2, which was still detected by monoclonal antibody 3-207.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied splicing of the polyoma virus early region pre-mRNA in vitro. This RNA is alternatively spliced in vivo to produce mRNA encoding the large, middle-sized (MTAg), and small (StAg) tumor antigens. Our primary interest was to learn how the 48-nucleotide StAg intron is excised, because the length of this intron is significantly less than the apparent minimum established for mammalian introns. Although the products of all three splices are detected in vitro, characterization of the pathway and sequence requirements of StAg splicing suggests that splicing factors interact with the precursor RNA in an unexpected way to catalyze removal of this intron. Specifically, StAg splicing uses either of two lariat branch points, one of which is located only 4 nucleotides from the 3' splice site. Furthermore, the StAg splice absolutely requires that the alternative MTAg 3' splice site, located 14 nucleotides downstream of the StAg 3' splice site, be intact. Insertion mutations that increase or decrease the quality of the MTAg pyrimidine stretch enhance or repress StAg as well as MTAg splicing, and a single-base change in the MTAg AG splice acceptor totally blocks both splices. These results demonstrate the ability of two 3' splice sites to cooperate with each other to bring about removal of a single intron.\r"

L-Buthionine-(R)-sulfoximine, which does not inactivate gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, did not affect proliferation. BSO-induced inhibition of accessory cell-independent T-cell proliferation was not reversed by recombinant human interleukin 2, despite activation-dependent expression of interleukin 2 receptor alpha by T cells treated with BSO. However, BSO-associated inhibition of T-cell proliferation was reversed by GSH or GSH ester. These studies, which show that GSH can directly modulate proliferation of highly purified T cells, suggest that GSH is essential for steps close to or at DNA synthesis. The availability of methods for decreasing and for increasing GSH levels suggest therapies to produce (i) immunosuppression (of value in organ transplantation), and (ii) immunopotentiation (of potential value in treatment of immunodeficiency states such as AIDS).\r"

This was done by photocoupling reactions using three toxin derivatives with photoactivatable moieties on Lys-15, Lys-47, and Lys-51. Competition data showed that Lys-47 belongs to the toxin-AcChoR interacting domain whereas the other two residues are excluded from it. We first tentatively determined the threshold of covalent coupling, indicative of the proximity between the photoactivatable probes and subunits, by quantifying the coupling occurring between the same derivatives and a model compound (i.e., a toxin-specific monoclonal antibody). We then (i) quantified the coupling yields occurring when both binding sites of AcChoR were occupied by the toxin derivatives, (ii) discriminately quantified the coupling yields at the high-affinity binding site, and (iii) deduced the coupling yields at the low-affinity binding site. In the high-affinity site, the probes on Lys-15 and Lys-47 predominantly reacted with the high-affinity site of the AcChoR alpha subunit whereas the probe on Lys-51 reacted with the delta subunit. In the low-affinity site, the probe on Lys-47 predominantly reacted with the low-affinity site of the alpha chain and the beta chain whereas those on Lys-15 and Lys-51 reacted with the gamma and delta chains, respectively. A three-dimensional model showing a unique organization of AcChoR bound to two toxin molecules is presented.\r"

The hypersensitive sites are found at positions 6.1, 10.9, 14.7, and 18 kilobase pairs (kbp) 5' of the epsilon-globin gene. Recently functional assays of the LAR that tested determinants for all four hypersensitive sites showed that expression of the human beta-globin gene was increased to normal or near-normal levels in both transgenic mice and erythroid cells. We constructed retroviral vectors with a human beta-globin gene and the determinant for a single hypersensitive site and measured beta-globin gene expression after retroviral infection of murine erythroleukemia cells. Fragments for the hypersensitive sites at -18 or -10.9 kbp increased human beta-globin RNA levels respectively to 35% or 132% of the endogenous mouse beta maj-globin RNA level. In addition, greater expression was also observed for the neomycin phosphotransferase RNA, which was transcribed from the retroviral LTR, showing that the LAR fragments activated expression from a heterologous promoter. In the context of gene-transfer experiments ultimately aimed at gene therapy, our results show that LAR determinants lead to an increased level of human beta-globin RNA expression after retroviral transfer into erythroid cells. But inclusion of LAR determinants in retroviral vectors also entails the potential risk of activating the expression of nonglobin genes in erythroid cells.\r"

In the regions sequenced, the rat brain class C and D gene products share approximately 75% amino acid identity with the rabbit skeletal muscle Ca channel. In addition, the class C polypeptide is almost identical to the rabbit cardiac Ca channel (97% identity). In contrast, the rat brain class A and B cDNAs are more distantly related to dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca channels (47-64% amino acid identity) and to the brain class C and D genes (51-55% amino acid identity). To examine the functional significance of the isolated brain cDNAs, hybrid depletion experiments were performed in Xenopus oocytes. Antisense oligonucleotides against class A and B cDNAs each partially inhibited, and a class C oligonucleotide almost fully inhibited, the expression of Ba current in rat brain mRNA injected oocytes; but none of the oligonucleotides affected the expression of voltage-gated Na or K conductances. The clone characterization and sequencing results demonstrate that a number of distinct, yet related, voltage-gated Ca-channel genes are expressed in the brain. The antisense oligonucleotide experiments specifically show that one or several of the Ca-channel classes are related to the Ca channels observed in rat brain mRNA injected oocytes.\r"

Intermediate A has been characterized as an Fev species with a secondary iron sigma-bond to carbon; it is captured by four different reagents or transformed into the second intermediate, B, which hydrolyzes to form a secondary alcohol. A mu-oxo Fe2III dimer is proposed as a basis for Gif-type reactivity. If the first iron is involved in the synthesis of intermediate A, the second is used to oxidize intermediate B intramolecularly to a ketal, which on hydrolysis yields a ketone. The enzyme methane monooxygenase shows a remarkable similarity to Gif-type systems in its selective hydrocarbon oxidation, particularly in the case of adamantane.\r"

We accomplished this by conjugating the iron-transport protein transferrin to polycations that bind nucleic acids. Human transferrin, as well as the chicken homologue conalbumin, has been covalently linked to the small DNA-binding protein protamine or to polylysines of various sizes through a disulfide linkage. These modified transferrin molecules maintain their ability to bind their cognate receptor and to mediate efficient iron transport into the cell. The transferrin-polycation molecules form electrophoretically stable complexes with double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and modified RNA molecules independent of nucleic acid size (from short oligonucleotides to DNA of 21 kilobase pairs). When complexes of transferrin-polycation and a bacterial plasmid DNA containing the gene for Photinus pyralis luciferase are supplied to eukaryotic cells, high-level expression of the luciferase gene occurs, demonstrating transferrin receptor-mediated endocytosis and expression of the imported DNA. We refer to this delivery system as \"transferrinfection.\"\r"

Analysis of a panel of seven cell lines that showed differential methylation at a Not I site between D13S10 and D13S21 proved physical linkage of the two loci to the same 875-kb Not I fragment. D13S22 mapped to a different Not I fragment, precluding the possibility that D13S22 is located between D13S10 and D13S21. PFGE analysis of Not I partial digests placed the 1850-kb Not I fragment containing D13S22 immediately adjacent to the 875-kb fragment containing the other two loci. The proximal rearrangement breakpoint in a cell line carrying a del13(q14.1q21.2) was detected by D13S21 but not by D13S10, demonstrating that D13S21 lies proximal to D13S10. Quantitative analysis of hybridization signals of the three DNA probes to DNA from the same cell line indicated that only D13S10 was deleted, establishing the order of these loci to be cen-D13S22-D13S21-D13S10-tel. Surprisingly, this order was estimated to be 35,000 times less likely than that favored by genetic linkage analysis.\r"

At present it is unclear what role class I peptide binding plays relative to T-cell receptor specificity in determination of immune recognition. A previous study from our group demonstrated that the HLA-A2.1 molecule could bind to 25% of the members of a panel of unrelated synthetic peptides as assessed by a functional peptide competition assay. To determine the peptide-binding specificity of another HLA class I molecule, we have examined the capacity of this panel of peptides to compete for the presentation of influenza virus nucleoprotein peptide NP-(335-350) by HLA-B37 to NP-peptide-specific HLA-B37-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte lines. Forty-two percent of peptides tested were capable of inhibiting NP-(335-350) presentation by HLA-B37. Remarkably, none of these HLA-B37-binding peptides belong to the subset that was previously shown to bind to the HLA-A2.1 molecule. Only the NP-(335-350) peptide was capable of binding to both HLA-A2.1 and HLA-B37. These findings demonstrate that the peptide-binding specificities of HLA-B37 and HLA-A2.1 are largely nonoverlapping and suggest that, from the universe of peptides, individual HLA class I molecules can bind to clearly distinct subsets of these peptides.\r"

This clone encodes an Fc gamma receptor as shown by the ability of cDNA-transfected COS cells to rosette IgG-coated sheep erythrocytes. The rtFc gamma R alpha is exceptionally homologous to the mouse moFc gamma R alpha, with 77% protein sequence identity and 71% nucleic acid identity overall. The transmembrane region of the rtFc gamma R alpha contains the sequence Leu-Phe-Ala-Val-Asp-Thr-Gly-Leu, which is present in the membrane sequences of four other Fc receptors including mouse Fc gamma R alpha, human Fc gamma RIII-2, and the Fc epsilon R alpha subunits of the rat and human high-affinity IgE-binding receptors. Also, the rtFc gamma R alpha cytoplasmic domain exhibits specific homology to other receptors derived from natural killer cells, human Fc gamma RIII-2 and mouse Fc gamma R alpha. However, the rtFc gamma R alpha cDNA clone is complementary to at least two different-sized mRNAs expressed by CRNK-16 cells, contrasting the single Fc gamma R-related mRNA species expressed by human and mouse natural killer cells. These rat mRNAs are homologous to both the 5' and the 3' end of the cDNA clone, suggesting that they may be (i) splice variants of one transcript or (ii) products of different but highly related genes.\r"

ODNs corresponded to the polymerase PB1 gene of either influenza A/WSN/33 virus or influenza C/JJ/50 virus. All compounds were 20 nucleotides long, including control ODNs containing mismatches. The phosphodiester ODNs (O-ODNs) failed to inhibit replication of influenza A and influenza C viruses at concentrations up to 80 microM, possibly due to intracellular nuclease digestion of the unmodified oligomers. By contrast, the phosphorothioate derivatives (S-ODNs) were found to inhibit replication of both influenza A and influenza C virus. The antiviral effect of S-ODNs against influenza A virus was found at concentrations as low as 1.25 microM and was present with mismatched oligomers. In the case of influenza C virus, the S-ODN complementary to the 3' end of the viral RNA of the PB1 gene revealed a sequence-specific antiviral activity at a concentration of 20 microM. (At the same concentration, S-ODNs with one or three mismatches showed little or no antiviral activity.) Reduction in plaque number reached six logarithms when this sequence-specific S-ODN was used at a concentration of 80 microM.\r"

The low-affinity, IL-2R alpha chain cannot by itself transduce a mitogenic signal, whereas IL-2 stimulates resting lymphocytes through the intermediate-affinity, IL-2R beta receptor. We report here identification of the genomic locus for IL-2R beta. The exons are contained on four EcoRI fragments of 1.1, 9.2, 7.2, and 13.7 kilobases. The 1.1-kilobase EcoRI fragment lies at the 5'-most end of the genomic locus and contains promoter sequences. The promoter contains no TATA box-like elements but does contain the d(GT)n class of middle repetitive elements, which may play an interesting regulatory role. The IL-2R beta gene is localized to chromosome 22q11.2-q12, a region that is the locus for several lymphoid neoplasias.\r"

An ELISA that preferentially measures the level of the biologically functioning, high-affinity/avidity antibodies against PND is described. In a retrospective study of 15 maternal/neonatal serum samples, the assay correctly identified the 4 uninfected and the 11 HIV-infected infants. Other clinical and laboratory parameters such as p24 antigen, phytohemagglutinin mitogenic index, and absolute surface antigen T4+ cell counts did not accurately predict HIV fetal transmission. In addition to introducing a promising diagnostic tool, this study provides the in vivo evidence that protective antibodies may prevent infection by HIV.\r"

  ".U": "90239031\r", 
  ".W": "The severe combined immune deficient (scid) mouse mutant is characterized by a general absence of functional B and T lymphocytes. This deficiency appears to result from a defect in the variable-diversity-joining (VDJ) recombinase system, which is responsible for the assembly of V, D, and J gene segments that code for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor (TCR) V regions. Most rearranged immunoglobulin or TCR genes in transformed scid lymphocytes contain abnormal J-associated deletions and are nonfunctional. A few functional lymphocyte clones do arise, however, in some young adult scid mice and in virtually all old scid mice; this phenomenon is referred to as leakiness. Alloreactive, CD3+ T-cell clones were isolated from leaky scid mice and the status of their TCR beta and gamma loci was examined in an effort to assess the nature of the recombinase activity that gives rise to functional scid lymphocytes. The recombination junctions of six gamma and two beta alleles were sequenced, representing four alloreactive T-cell clones. All of the junctions were indistinguishable from those seen in normal cells. These results cannot be attributed to selection by antigen because other rearranged TCR genes account for the TCR molecules expressed by these T-cell clones. We conclude that reversion of the scid phenotype can occur in rare lymphocyte progenitors and may account for most functional lymphocyte clones in leaky scid mice.\r"

K0.5, the half-maximal effect of the enantiomer (-)-cromakalim, is as low as 10 nM, whereas K0.5 for nicorandil is 100 nM. These two compounds appear to have a much higher affinity for nerve cells than for smooth muscle cells. Openers of sulfonylurea-sensitive K+ channels lead to inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid release. There is an excellent relationship between potency to activate 86Rb+ efflux and potency to inhibit neurotransmitter release.\r"

In addition the extract was sufficient for maintaining long-term cultures of CHSE-214 cells for several months through a minimum of 20 passages (approximately 50 population doublings) in the absence of serum. Optimal response was achieved with 100 micrograms of extract protein per ml, but a significant growth-promoting effect was observed with as little as 2.5 micrograms/ml. The activity was nondialyzable, protease-sensitive, and stable in 200 mM acetic acid. The level of mitogenic response induced by the extract could not be duplicated with purified mammalian growth factors added individually or in combination, and the extract did not stimulate DNA synthesis in quiescent mouse fibroblasts.

In the zebra finch (Poephila guttata), this nucleus contains more and larger neurons in the male than in the female. A single injection of tritiated thymidine into the egg on the 6th or 7th day of incubation resulted in labeling of many RA neurons with tritium. The size of tritium-labeled neurons and the tissue volume containing them did not differ between the sexes at 15 days after hatching. In the adult brain, tritium-labeled neurons and the tissue volume containing them were much larger in the male than in the female. Also, tritium-labeled RA neurons were large in females which received an implant of estrogen immediately after hatching. The gender differences in the neuron size and nuclear volume of the zebra finch RA are, therefore, due not to the replacement of old neurons by new ones during development but to the growth and atrophy of neurons born before hatching. Similarly, the masculinizing effects of estrogen on the female RA are due not to neuronal replacement but to the prevention of atrophy and promotion of growth in preexisting neurons.\r"

Molecular clones for the GA733-2 antigen were isolated from a colorectal carcinoma cell line cDNA library using the high-efficiency COS cell expression system. A 1.4-kilobase cDNA species was enriched by immunoselection with monoclonal antibody. The authenticity of individual clones was established by immunologic and sequence criteria. At the amino acid sequence level, GA733-2 was found to be greater than 99% identical to the previously described KSA antigen defined by monoclonal antibody KS1/4. The amino acid sequence derived from the previously described GA733-related gene, GA733-1, was found to be 49% identical to GA733-2. The positions of 12 cysteine residues in the extracellular domains of the two GA733 antigens are conserved, as is the overall distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues. A 1.45-kilobase transcript of the GA733-2/KSA gene was found to be expressed in cell lines derived from colorectal and pancreatic carcinoma.\r"

  ".U": "90239052\r", 
  ".W": "Several observations suggest that the Ca2(+)-dependent postsynaptic release of nitric oxide (NO) may be important in the formation and function of the vertebrate nervous system. We explore here the hypothesis that the release of NO and its subsequent diffusion may be critically related to three aspects of nervous system function: (i) synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation in certain regions of the adult nervous system, (ii) the control of cerebral blood flow in such regions, and (iii) the establishment and activity-dependent refinement of axonal projections during the later stages of development. In this paper, we detail and analyze the basic assumptions underlying this NO hypothesis and describe a computer simulation of a minimal version of the hypothesis. In the simulation, a 3-dimensional volume of neuropil is presented with patterned afferent input; NO is produced, diffuses, and is destroyed; and synaptic strengths are determined by a set of synaptic rules based on the correlation of synaptic depolarization and NO levels. According to the hypothesis, voltage-dependent postsynaptic release of this rapidly diffusing substance links the activities of neurons in a local volume of tissue, regardless of whether the neurons are directly connected by synapses. This property is demonstrated in the simulation, and it is this property that is exploited in the hypothesis to account for certain aspects of long-term potentiation and activity-dependent sharpening of axonal arbors.\r"

Fluorescence-image analysis of isolated normal and TR- hepatocyte \"doublets\", which retain a bile canaliculus between them, revealed that normal hepatocytes readily transport a fluorescent bile acid (fluorescein isothiocyanate glycocholate) and a nonbile acid organic anion (carboxydichlorofluorescein diacetate) into the canaliculus. Hepatocyte doublets from TR- rats also transported fluorescein isothiocyanate glycocholate normally, but transport of carboxydichlorofluorescein diacetate into the canaliculus was negligible. Vesicles derived from the canicular domain of the plasma membrane of hepatocytes (CMV) from control and TR- rats were used to characterize the transport process for 35S-labeled bromosulphthalein and 35S-labeled bromosulphthalein glutathione, which represent nonbile acid organic anions. CMV from normal rat hepatocytes had an ATP- and temperature-dependent, saturable transport process for these 35S-labeled compounds that was absent in CMV from TR- rats. CMV from TR- rats retained normal ATP-dependent transport of daunomycin, and immunologic blots with a monoclonal antibody against the multidrug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein, revealed no difference between normal and TR-CMV. These studies reveal that the bile canaliculus in normal rats contains an ATP-dependent organic anion transport system that is functionally absent in TR- mutant rats. The defect in TR- mutant rats is phenotypically similar to that seen in mutant Corriedale sheep and in the Dubin-Johnson syndrome in man.\r"

Endothelial cells were cultured in chemically defined medium containing a constant, saturating amount of basic fibroblast growth factor. Formation of cell-FN contacts was then varied in a controlled fashion by three different techniques: (i) nonadhesive, bacteriological dishes were precoated with increasing densities of FN; (ii) soluble RGD peptides were used to progressively inhibit binding of cell-surface integrin receptors to adsorbed FN; and (iii) FN-coated surfaces were covered with increasingly thick layers of polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate (a nonadhesive polymer) to physically restrict cell access to FN binding sites. Endothelial cells became more extended and proliferated more rapidly as FN coating concentrations were raised from approximately 250 to approximately 10,000 FN molecules per micron 2. Computerized morphometric analysis confirmed that cell shape (projected cell areas) was determined by the density of FN contacts and that DNA synthetic levels were tightly coupled to the extent of cell spreading, regardless of the method used to perturb cell adhesion. In contrast, neither soluble FN nor cell-surface binding of FN-coated microbeads (diameter, 4.5 microns) had any effect on growth when cells were grown in suspension and cell spreading was prohibited. These results suggest that FN controls capillary endothelial cell proliferation based on its ability to support tension-dependent alterations of cell shape--i.e., both by binding to cell-surface integrins and by resisting mechanical loads that are applied to these receptors.\r"

  ".U": "90239058\r", 
  ".W": "A major goal of current hematopoiesis research is to develop in vitro methods suitable for the measurement and characterization of stem cells with long-term in vivo repopulating potential. Previous studies from several centers have suggested the presence in normal human or murine marrow of a population of very primitive cells that are biologically, physically, and pharmacologically different from cells detectable by short-term colony assays and that can give rise to the latter in long-term cultures (LTCs) containing a competent stromal cell layer. In this report, we show that such cultures can be used to provide a quantitative assay for human \"LTC-initiating cells\" based on an assessment of the number of clonogenic cells present after 5-8 weeks. Production of derivative clonogenic cells is shown to be absolutely dependent on the presence of a stromal cell feeder. When this requirement is met, the clonogenic cell output (determined by assessment of 5-week-old cultures) is linearly related to the input cell number over a wide range of cell concentrations. Using limiting dilution analysis techniques, we have established the frequency of LTC-initiating cells in normal human marrow to be approximately 1 per 2 X 10(4) cells and in a highly purified CD34-positive subpopulation to be approximately 1 per 50-100 cells. The proliferative capacity exhibited by individual LTC-initiating cells cultured under apparently identical culture conditions was found to be highly variable. Values for the number of clonogenic cells per LTC-initiating cell in 5-week-old cultures ranged from 1 to 30 (the average being 4) with similar levels being detected in positive 8-week-old cultures. Some LTC-initiating cells are multipotent as evidenced by their generation of erythroid as well as granulopoietic progeny. The availability of a system for quantitative analysis of the proliferative and differentiative behavior of this newly defined compartment of primitive human hematopoietic cells should facilitate future studies of specific genetic or microenvironmental parameters involved in the regulation of these cells.\r"

Here we isolated the human homologue of rig from a genomic DNA library constructed from a human esophageal carcinoma and determined its complete nucleotide sequence. The gene is composed of about 3000 nucleotides and divided into four exons separated by three introns: exon 3 encodes the nuclear location signal and the DNA-binding domain of the RIG protein. The transcription initiation site was located at -46 base pairs upstream from the first ATG codon. The 5'-flanking region of the gene has no apparent TATA-box or CAAT-box sequence. However, two GC boxes are found at -189 and -30 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site and five GC boxes are also found in introns 1 and 2. The gene is bounded in the 5' region by CpG islands, regions of DNA with a high GC content and a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. Furthermore, the human genome contains at least six copies of RIG pseudogenes, and four of them have the characteristics of processed pseudogenes. From these results together with the finding that RIG is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cells, we speculate that RIG belongs to the class of \"housekeeping\" genes, whose products are necessary for the growth of all cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Retroviral transduction of cellular nucleic acid sequences requires illegitimate RNA or DNA recombination. To test a model that postulates transduction via efficient illegitimate recombination during reverse transcription of viral and cellular RNAs, we have measured the ability of Harvey sarcoma viruses (HaSVs) with artificial 3' termini to recover a retroviral 3' terminus from helper Moloney virus (MoV) by illegitimate and homologous recombination. For this purpose, mouse NIH 3T3 cells were transformed with Harvey proviruses and then superinfected with MoV. The proviruses lacked the 3' long terminal repeat and an untranscribed region of the 5' long terminal repeat to prevent virus regeneration from input provirus. Only 0-11 focus-forming units of HaSV were generated upon MoV superinfection of 3 x 10(6) cells transformed by Harvey proviruses with MoV-unrelated termini. This low frequency is consistent with illegitimate DNA recombination via random Moloney provirus integration 3' of the transforming viral ras gene in the 10(6)-kilobase mouse genome. When portions of murine viral envelope (env) genes were attached 3' of ras, 10(2)-10(5) focus-forming units of HaSV were generated, depending on the extent of homology with env of MoV. These recombinants all contained HaSV-specific sequences 5' and MoV-specific sequences 3' of the common env homology. They were probably generated by recombination during reverse transcription rather than by recombination among either input or secondary proviruses, since (i) the yield of recombinants was reduced by a factor of 10 when the env sequence was flanked by splice signals and (ii) HaSV RNAs without retroviral 3' termini would be inadequate templates for provirus synthesis. We conclude that there is no efficient illegitimate recombination in retroviruses. In view of known precedents of illegitimate DNA recombination, the structure of known viral onc genes, and our evidence for illegitimate DNA recombination via provirus integration, we favor the DNA model of transduction over the RNA model.\r"

The inhibition occurs after as little as 8 hr of viral infection and requires contact between effector cells and HSV-infected targets. Inhibition evidently stems from direct blockade of killer cell function because killer cells placed atop HSV-infected targets rapidly become incapable of lysing subsequently added HL-60 or K-562 cells. The impairment of killer cell function is prevented when protein glycosylation in HSV-infected cells is blocked with tunicamycin. These studies may be relevant for understanding the persistence of herpes simplex virus infections and, further, suggest a mechanism for failed immune surveillance.\r"

The binding of this 68-kDa polypeptide was detected by UV cross-linking proteins to TAR element RNA transcribed in vitro. Competition experiments were performed by using a partially purified preparation of the protein to quantify the relative binding affinities of TAR element RNA mutants. The binding affinity of the TAR mutants paralleled the reported ability of those mutants to support tat trans-activation in vivo. We propose that this cellular protein moderates TAR activity in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "90239067\r", 
  ".W": "Clinical assessment of the activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) against human cancer has been limited by a dose-dependent cardiovascular toxicity, most frequently hypotension. TNF is also thought to mediate the vascular collapse resulting from bacterial endotoxin. The present studies address the mechanism by which TNF causes hypotension and provide evidence for elevated production of nitric oxide, a potent vasodilator initially characterized as endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Nitric oxide is synthesized by several cell types, including endothelial cells and macrophages, from the guanidino nitrogen of L-arginine; the enzymatic pathway is competitively inhibited by NG-methyl-L-arginine. We found that hypotension induced in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs by TNF (10 micrograms/kg, i.v., resulting in a fall in mean systemic arterial pressure from 124.7 +/- 7 to 62.0 +/- 22.9 mmHg; 1 mmHg = 133 Pa) was completely reversed within 2 min following administration of NG-methyl-L-arginine (4.4 mg/kg, i.v.). In contrast, NG-methyl-L-arginine failed to reverse the hypotensive response to an equivalent depressor dose of nitroglycerin, a compound that acts by forming nitric oxide by a nonenzymatic, arginine-independent mechanism. The effect of NG-methyl-L-arginine on TNF-induced hypotension was antagonized, and the hypotension restored, by administration of excess L-arginine (100 mg/kg, i.v.). Our findings suggest that excessive nitric oxide production mediates the hypotensive effect of TNF.\r"

To test this premise, 14 healthy, untrained men trained four days per week for 20 weeks on a bicycle ergometer for endurance (END Group, n = 4), on an isokinetic device for increased torque production (ITP Group, n = 5), or on both devices (COMBO Group, n = 5). The ITP and COMBO groups had equal torque gains throughout the study (234 +/- 45 and 232 +/- 23 N.m, respectively). After 11 weeks, both END and COMBO groups had similar gains in maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) (in milliliters per kilogram of body weight per minute). During the last half of the study, however, the END Group had a significant gain in VO2max (p less than .05) of 4.7 +/- 1.2 mL.kg-1.min-1, whereas the COMBO Group had a nonsignificant gain (p greater than .05) of 1.8 +/- 0.6 mL.kg-1.min-1. In harmony with this finding, the END Group showed a significant increase (p less than .05) in citrate synthase activity (15.5 +/- 7.9 mumol.g-1.min-1), whereas the COMBO Group had no significant increase. The authors concluded that simultaneous training may inhibit the normal adaptation to either training program when performed alone. The extent of the interference probably depends on the nature and intensity of the individual training program.

Fifty-six postmenopausal women (means age = 55.4 years, s = 7.1; means height = 162.6 cm, s = 6.4; means weight = 65.9 kg, s = 9.3) served as subjects. Bone mineral density was measured from the L2-L4 vertebral bodies, greater trochanter, femoral neck, and Ward's triangle using dual-photon absorptiometry. Hip abduction, knee extension, hip flexion, and grip force were assessed using the Spark Muscle Examination and Exercise Dosimeter (MEED) 3000 system. The Pearson product-moment correlations between muscle torque and BMD ranged from .07 to .42. The significant (p less than .05) correlations between torque and BMD (r = .27-.42) occurred in functionally and anatomically related areas. Results of this study demonstrate a statistically significant relationship between torque and BMD in anatomically related areas in postmenopausal women. This relationship, however, is not sufficiently strong to allow for prediction of BMD from the four muscle groups tested in this study. The relationship does suggest that strength may be a factor in the determination of BMD. Maintenance of strength in those muscle groups with anatomical or functional relationships to the hip and lumbar spine may play a role in the prevention and cessation of the osteoporotic changes that occur.\r"

Field notes constructed from the observations and transcribed data were used to develop coding categories. These categories were the basis for the development of five themes that describe some aspects of the therapeutic intervention: 1) how treatment time is allocated, 2) the types and uses of information gathered from the patient, 3) the impact of the therapeutic environment, 4) the degree of responsive therapeutic interaction, and 5) the therapist integration of nontherapeutic interaction with therapeutic interaction. These findings are a beginning for understanding the practice of physical therapy.\r"

In this study, hydrogen bonding of 1-alkanol series (ethanol to eicosanol) to dipalmitoyl-L-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in DPPC-D2O-in-CCl4 reversed micelles. The alkanols formed hydrogen bonds with the phosphate moiety of DPPC and released the DPPC-bound deuterated water, evidenced by increases in the bound O-H stretching signal of the alkanol-DPPC complex and also in the free O-D stretching band of unbound D2O. These effects increased according to the elongation of the carbon chain of 1-alkanols from ethanol (C2) to 1-decanol (C10), but suddenly almost disappeared at 1-tetradecanol (C14). Anesthetic potencies of these alkanols, estimated by the activity of brine shrimps, were linearly related to hydrogen bond-breaking activities below C10 and agreed with the FTIR data in the cutoff at C10.\r"

Its amino acid sequence (60 residues) has limited homology to the Kunitz-type inhibitors. However, unlike other inhibitors of this class, TAP inhibits only factor Xa. It had no effect at a 300-fold molar excess on factor VIIa, kallikrein, trypsin, chymotrypsin, thrombin, urokinase, plasmin, tissue plasminogen activator, elastase, or Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease.

The differences in the currents of the various gene products are greater than the differences produced by alternative splicing of the Shaker gene. In Drosophila, the transient (A current) subtype of the potassium channel (Shaker and Shal) and the delayed-rectifier subtype (Shab and Shaw) are encoded by homologous genes, and there is more than one gene for each subtype of channel.

The role of PLC-gamma in the phosphoinositide signaling pathway was addressed by examining the effect of overexpression of PLC-gamma on cellular responses to PDGF. Overexpression of PLC-gamma correlated with PDGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-gamma and with PDGF-induced breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). However, neither bradykinin- nor lysophosphatidic acid-induced phosphoinositide metabolism was enhanced in the transfected cells, suggesting that the G protein-coupled phosphoinositide responses to these ligands are mediated by other PLC isozymes. The enhanced PDGF-induced generation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) did not enhance intracellular calcium signaling or influence PDGF-induced DNA synthesis. Thus, enzymes other than PLC-gamma may limit PDGF-induced calcium signaling and DNA synthesis. Alternatively, PDGF-induced calcium signaling and DNA synthesis may use biochemical pathways other than phosphoinositide metabolism for signal transduction.\r"

The amino-terminal portion of the peptide sequence (NH2-Glu-Val-Val-Pro-His-Lys-Lys) is clearly interpretable in the electron density map of the Fab'-peptide complex and adopts a well-defined type II beta-turn in the concave antigen binding pocket. This same peptide amino acid sequence in native Mhr is alpha-helical. The peptide conformation when bound to the Fab' is inconsistent with binding of the Fab' to native Mhr, and suggests that binding of the Fab' to conformationally altered forms of the native Mhr or to apo-Mhr. Immunological mapping previously identified this sequence as the peptide epitope, and its fine specificity correlates well with the structural analysis. The binding pocket includes a large percentage of hydrophobic residues. The buried surfaces of the peptide and the antibody are complementary in shape and cover 460 A2 and 540 A2, respectively. These two structures now enable a comparison of a specific monoclonal Fab' both in its free and antigen complexed state. While no major changes in the antibody were observed when peptide was bound, there were some small but significant side chain and main chain rearrangements.\r"

Differences shown in mitochondrial DNA genotype frequency among green turtle colonies in the Caribbean Sea and Atlantic Ocean are consistent with natal homing expectations and indicate that social facilitation to nonnatal sites is rare.\r"

Specific cytokine antagonists enable the identification of particular cytokines involved in the response and offer a means for modifying it. Systemic administration of a soluble, extracellular portion of the receptor for interleukin-1 (sIL-1R) had profound inhibitory effects on the development of in vivo alloreactivity. Survival of heterotopic heart allografts was prolonged from 12 days in controls to 17 days in mice treated with sIL-1R. Lymph node hyperplasia in response to a localized injection of allogeneic cells was completely blocked by sIL-1R treatment. The inhibition was overcome by simultaneous administration of interleukin-1 (IL-1); thus, sIL-1R acts by neutralizing IL-1. These results implicate IL-1 as a regulator of allograft rejection and demonstrate the in vivo biological efficacy of a soluble cytokine receptor.\r"

The cumulative recurrence mortality rates were 2.2% at 9 years for mucosal cancer and 8.4% at 8 years for submucosal cancer. The recurrence patterns of early gastric cancer were hematogenic metastasis to the liver, lung, or bone (nine cases), recurrence from lymph nodes (three cases), and recurrence in the residual stomach (five cases). Submucosal cancers with a macroscopically elevated appearance, lymph node metastasis, and evidence of vessel invasion were the high-risk cancers for hematogenic recurrence, and adjuvant chemotherapy should be prescribed. Two cases of lymph node recurrence were attributed to inadequacy of lymph node dissection. Because metastasis to the group 2 lymph nodes was noted in 1.5% of cases of early gastric cancer and a macroscopic diagnosis of nodal status was inaccurate, complete dissection should be performed regardless of identification of metastasis. Five cases of recurrence in the residual stomach were attributed to overlooked lesions of multiple carcinoma and were detected at an advanced stage. Careful and regular postoperative follow-up is required to detect these recurrences at an early stage.\r"

Hepatic resection was performed not only for patients with liver cirrhosis and obstructive jaundice but also for patients with advanced disease. Eighty (67.2%) of the 119 patients had liver cirrhosis and four patients had obstructive jaundice. Two or more segments of the liver were resected in 56 (47.0%) patients, 29 of whom had liver cirrhosis. Eleven patients died within 30 days after surgery, an operative mortality rate of 9.2%. Seven additional patients could not be discharged from the hospital, resulting in a hospital death rate of 5.9%. Seventeen of these 18 patients had cirrhosis. Selection of patients with sufficient reserve function of the remaining liver portion, caused a great reduction of the incidence of postoperative death. The 5-year actuarial survival rate for the 101 patients who were discharged from the hospital was 39%, and 13 patients lived longer than 5 years, the longest survival period being 13 years 10 months. Hepatocellular carcinoma is amenable to hepatic resection if patients with sufficient reserve function of the liver are selected.\r"

To minimize postoperative liver dysfunction, a portal venous branch was embolized before surgery to induce atrophy of the lobe to be resected and hypertrophy of the contralateral lobe in 14 patients with hilar bile duct carcinoma. Bile was drained before surgery in 11 patients with jaundice. Portal embolization did not produce major side effects, and moderate increases of serum transaminase activity or bilirubin returned to baseline values within 1 week. Hepatectomy with bile duct resection and lymphadenectomy was performed 6 to 41 days after embolization, at which time the embolized lobe was atrophied in 12 of the patients. Extended right or left lobectomy or left trisegmentectomy (10, 3, and 1 cases, respectively) with biliointestinal reconstruction was performed. One patient with jaundice and suppurative cholangitis died 30 days after hepatectomy. Another patient died 3 months after surgery of aggravated hepatitis. After surgery, no bile leakage occurred and hyperbilirubinemia was usually moderate and reversible.\r"

The indications and surgical technique for arterial conduits are presented. There were no differences in intraoperative vascular flow studies, postoperative liver function, or incidence of rejection in the two groups. There were, however, more deaths in the conduit group, two of which are related to the retropancreatic conduit technique, with the others caused by the patients' underlying condition at transplantation. There was no morbidity or death associated with the antepancreatic conduit techniques. We therefore believe the use of arterial conduits from the aorta or iliac artery, when placed antepancreatically, are safe and should be used without reservation when indicated.\r"

This study evaluated the effects of intraarterial verapamil and DSMs on hemodynamics and doxorubicin tissue levels. Rabbits (n = 34) with hepatic VX-2 carcinomas underwent hepatic artery infusion of doxurubicin (3 mg/kg) alone, with two doses of verapamil, and with verapamil plus DSMs. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored, and heart, liver, and tumor tissue was obtained after 30 or 90 minutes. After verapamil (2 mg/kg) alone, mean heart rate decreased but infusion of verapamil plus DSMs resulted in only a 14% decrease in mean heart rate. Thirty minutes after drug infusions, mean hepatic tissue levels of doxorubicin were increased significantly by 2 mg/kg of verapamil compared with results with 1 mg/kg of verapamil and those in control groups (p less than 0.05). Mean tumor doxorubicin levels were not significantly different with verapamil alone. Verapamil plus DSMs or DSMs alone resulted in significantly lower mean hepatic and myocardial levels and increased mean tumor/liver ratios of doxorubicin after 90 minutes, compared with results in control or verapamil-alone groups. These results suggest that hepatic tumor drug levels are more affected by changes in regional blood flow with DSMs than by cellular drug transport changes caused by calcium channel blockers such as verapamil.\r"

Our recent experience with young patients with atherosclerotic claudication was reviewed to determine whether more liberal use of angioplasty and surgery is warranted in these patients to salvage their military careers and improve their life-styles. A systemic review was made of patients aged 40 years and younger with atherosclerosis who have undergone arteriography at our institution during the past 67 months. From this study, 22 patients were found with the initial complaint of intermittent claudication. Fifteen of these patients (68%) had occlusive disease confined to the iliac arteries, and six (27%) had single-level occlusive disease in a femoropopliteal distribution. Only one patient had multilevel disease. Symptoms of coronary occlusive disease developed in five patients (23%) within 38 months of the onset of claudication, and two of these patients died of myocardial infarctions. Of 19 patients who underwent interventions to correct symptoms of claudication, 16 (85%) had complete relief of symptoms at the end of follow-up, ranging from 6 months to 7 years. Ten of these patients remained symptom free after a single intervention, but six patients had rapid progression of disease and required secondary procedures. These results indicate that a majority of young patients with claudication caused by atherosclerosis can be returned to full active-duty status in the military after angioplasty or surgery. However, some patients may require secondary procedures to relieve recurrent symptoms caused by rapid progression of disease. We believe that an aggressive interventional approach is warranted in the evaluation and treatment of young patients with work-limiting claudication caused by atherosclerosis. These patients are at significant risk of developing premature coronary occlusive disease and should be monitored closely.\r"

Eight opossums implanted with a gallbladder cannula, gastrointestinal bipolar electrodes, and a carotid catheter were subjected to hemorrhagic shock of 30 mm Hg for 60 minutes by the removal of arterial blood. Shed blood was reinfused after the shock period. Fasting gallbladder volume and gastrointestinal electrical activity were studied before, immediately after, and 24 hours after hemorrhagic shock. Control measurements demonstrated a slow-wave frequency maximal in the duodenum (18.1 +/- 1.1 waves/min), with a plateau in the proximal third of the small bowel, decreasing thereafter. The migrating motor complex (MMC) had a duration of 118 +/- 28 minutes. The average volume of the gallbladder before shock was 5.4 +/- 1.5 ml. Gallbladder volume fluctuated with the MMC, being maximal during phase I and minimal in phase III. The volume of blood removed to reduce mean arterial pressure to 30 mm Hg was 45 +/- 5 ml/kg. Immediately after the shock and blood reinfusion, slow-wave frequency decreased by 40% in the antrum and 25% in the small bowel. The MMC was of shorter duration (91 +/- 22 minutes; p less than 0.05), and gallbladder volume increased to 7.0 +/- 1.7 ml (p less than 0.05). Fluctuations in gallbladder volume during the MMC were absent. Twenty-four hours after shock, slow-wave frequency, MMC, and gallbladder volume had returned to normal and were not different from control measurements. Ischemic damage to the gastrointestinal tract is postulated as the cause of gallbladder dysfunction and altered intestinal motility after hemorrhagic shock.\r"

This study was performed to evaluate the hypothesis that in such situations the extent of the tissue injury caused by ischemia itself prevented detection of a reperfusion component. Rats were subjected to near-total intestinal ischemia by means of a hydrostatic pressure clamp that produced preferential venous occlusion (strangulation) for periods from 1 to 90 minutes. Tissue injury was evaluated microscopically by a blinded examiner. Ischemic periods of 20 minutes or less did not induce detectable tissue injury. Longer durations of ischemia caused villous injury: the longer the period of ischemia, the more extensive the tissue injury. However, there was no exacerbation of injury seen after reperfusion, regardless of the duration of ischemia. In a separate series of rats, total arterial occlusion was employed without concomitant venous congestion. Such isolation arterial occlusion of 40 to 60 minutes' duration was followed by a statistically significant exacerbation of tissue injury at reperfusion. Thus total intestinal ischemia may be followed by reperfusion injury if there is no concomitant congestion and if ischemic injury is not too extensive.\r"

  ".W": "We measured levels of antibodies to Giardia lamblia by age in serum specimens from persons in Denver, Colorado, and Soongnern, Thailand. Serum levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA G lamblia-specific antibodies measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay increased substantially during childhood in both geographic areas, although children in Soongnern showed significantly higher mean levels of each antibody class (P less than .05). After adolescence, levels of G lamblia-specific IgM fell steadily with age in both populations. In contrast, specific IgA levels remained elevated throughout life among the Thai but decreased to low levels among adults in Denver. Similarly, rates of carriage of G lamblia were high among children aged 1 to 4 years in Denver and Soongnern (14.3% versus 26.5%, respectively) but were much lower among adults in Denver (0% versus 14%; P less than .01). These data suggest that levels of G lamblia-specific IgM may reflect exposure to the parasite early in life in both areas. Levels of parasite-specific IgA may reflect recurrent exposure to G lamblia in Soongnern, where G lamblia is endemic, but less frequent exposure to the parasite in Denver, where exposure is often episodic.\r"

Our study examines medical students' and residents' awareness of the malpractice litigation environment and their reasons for choosing a specialty that is at either high or low risk for malpractice suits. Longitudinal data showed that students continued to choose high-risk specialties (40%) even though they perceived problems in the current climate of litigation. Among the reasons for their choices were enjoyment and being able to practice in a procedure-oriented specialty that is effective in its mode of treatment. Those who chose low-risk specialties (60%) rated as important the variety of diseases seen and the opportunity to know patients well. Issues related to the malpractice climate were important only to those who switched from a high- to a low-risk specialty. These findings have implications for professional staffing needs.\r"

The new test was evaluated against the benchmark diagnostic skin tests and the radioallergosorbent serologic tests for sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and technical feasibility in an office setting. It was found that while the Quidel allergy screen lacks the specificity of the standard tests, its overall sensitivity, as defined by the percentage of patients with positive skin reactions who also tested positive with the Quidel screen (68%), its ease of use, and its rapidity warrant its consideration as a screening tool for confirming a possible case of allergy.\r"

The ratio of office-based primary care physicians to population has also decreased. Graduate medical education is funded largely from patient care revenues, but the low rate of reimbursement for ambulatory care makes training in primary care specialties especially dependent on public support. Medicare, the Veterans Administration, and the University of California provide more than $325 million a year in support of graduate medical education in California. Federal and state grant programs provide $5 million a year for family physician training in the state, but appropriations to these programs have been reduced in real terms. California family practice residencies are disproportionately located at county hospitals, where funding shortfalls make them especially vulnerable to cuts in grant programs. Additional resources will be needed if more family physicians are to be trained.\r"

In this study, the algorithm was easily applied by family physicians, and the results were similar to those reported by expert clinical pharmacologists. Nine percent of our elderly patients' hospital admissions were caused by ADRs that were due to usual doses of medications commonly prescribed for elderly patients. Average age of patients and number of medications were similar for persons with and without ADRs. The algorithm can be useful to physicians investigating ADRs for clinical research, physician education, quality assurance, and improved patient care.\r"

Copies of the ACS cancer screening guidelines were posted in all examination and conference rooms and were provided to all residents. The intervention addressing the behavioral barriers had three components: (1) identification by the nursing staff of eligible women who were overdue for a mammogram as they presented for care, (2) completion of a checklist by residents indicating whether a mammogram was or was not recommended and why, and (3) a nurse-initiated backup reminder system for patients who escaped the primary checklist system. An audit of 200 preintervention and 270 postintervention charts showed statistically and clinically significant increases in mammograms recommended or done. Similar statistically significant increases were found in a cohort of 111 charts of patients in both the pre- and the postintervention audits. Results indicate that an intervention designed to eliminate identified resident-dependent barriers to compliance with screening mammography guidelines can be effective in increasing recommended mammography rates.\r"

Urodynamic findings were essentially unchanged by wearing diaphragm rings. Trends toward improvement were observed in the results of pad tests and symptom diaries. Four of the 10 women experienced clinically significant improvement in amount of urine lost during pad tests, number of leaks per week, and overall assessment of response. Vaginal diaphragm rings may be an effective treatment for some women with stress urinary incontinence.\r"

Routine use of echocardiography or 24-hour ambulatory monitoring is not recommended in the initial work-up of hypertension. The optimum goal for the diastolic blood pressure remains at 80 to 85 mm Hg. As many as 20 to 25 percent of patients with mild hypertension become normotensive with dietary modifications, exercise and alcohol cessation. In patients with mild hypertension, these nonpharmacologic approaches should be tried for three to six months before drug therapy is instituted. Initial drug therapy should be chosen on the basis of effectiveness, ease of administration, tolerability, cost and long-term safety record. Many of the reported adverse metabolic effects of diuretics may be of limited clinical significance. Despite the availability of newer antihypertensives, diuretics remain a choice in most patients as initial therapy or as a step-2 drug.\r"

Chest radiographs may be normal or may show hilar adenopathy, infiltrates, pulmonary nodules or thin-walled cavities. The spherulin skin test is usually positive within three weeks of infection. Specific IgM [corrected] antibodies may be detected early in the course; IgG [corrected] antibodies develop after two to three months. In most patients, the disease has a self-limited course and requires no specific therapy. A few patients develop progressive pulmonary or disseminated disease. Extrapulmonary sites of disease include the skin, the skeleton and, rarely, the nervous system. Amphotericin B and ketoconazole are used to treat disseminated disease. Because coccidioidomycosis is caused by a fungus that is endemic in the Southwest, a travel history should be elicited from patients with persistent pulmonary symptoms.\r"

The effect of placebo and 100, 200, and 400 mg oral caffeine on energy expenditure, plasma concentrations of substrates and hormones, blood pressure, and heart rate was investigated in a double-blind study in healthy subjects who had a moderate habitual caffeine consumption. Caffeine increased energy expenditure dose dependently and the thermogenic response was positively correlated with the response in plasma caffeine (r = 0.52; p less than 0.018), plasma lactate (r = 0.79; p less than 0.000001), and plasma triglyceride (r = 0.53; p less than 0.02). Stepwise regression analysis with the thermogenic response as the dependent variable excluded plasma caffeine and yielded the following equation: thermic effect (kcal/3 h) = -0.00459 X heart rate + 0.30315 X (triglyceride) + 0.53114 X (lactate) + 15.34 (r = 0.86; p = 0.0001).

Growth during pregnancy has been masked by a tendency of all gravidas to shrink while pregnant (approximately 0.5 cm over 6 mo of observation). Consequently, growth of many adolescent gravidas has not been clinically apparent. There was no effect on maternal growth during a first pregnancy in adolescence but this may be a result of the relatively good prepregnant nutrition status of the young gravidas in developed countries. Maternal growth during pregnancy, however, is associated with significantly decreased (-282 g, p less than 0.05) birth weight for infants when maternal growth continues during a subsequent adolescent pregnancy. This observation is consistent with the hypothesized competition between the metabolic demands of the growing adolescent mother and the nutrient needs of her developing fetus.\r"

When ordinary food coloring or unusual food coloring was added, acid secretion and gastrin release were similar to a control study with no food coloring added. Moreover, addition of 360 mg monosodium glutamate to beef consomme soup had no effect on the acid secretory or gastrin response to the meal.

We observed that stimulated human monocyte and/or macrophage production of superoxide and the occurrence of monocyte chemiluminescence, two indices of monocyte inflammatory activity, were significantly reduced by the ingestion of 6 g n-3 fatty acids/d for 6 wk. This effect was associated with a reduction of stearic and arachidonic acids whereas eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations rose significantly. These results indicate that modest dietary n-3 fatty acid supplementation can reduce stimulated human-monocyte free-radical production and may impair the capability of macrophages derived from monocytes to promote oxidation of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and associated cellular toxicity.\r"

The higher alpha-linolenic acid availability in Canada is largely accounted for by widespread use of canola oil there. Considering also contributions to dietary alpha-linolenic acid of other foods such as nuts, dairy products, and vegetables, it would appear that total intake of alpha-linolenic acid in US and Canadian diets adequately exceeds the reported nutritional requirement. Emerging research has suggested possible health benefits associated with modest increases in dietary alpha-linolenic acid, including reduced blood-clotting tendency and reduced blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of vitamin C after a 500-mg oral tablet dose were compared in 15 healthy young men aged 25.20 +/- 2.54 (means +/- SD) and in 15 healthy elderly men aged 69.31 +/- 2.52 y. The doses were characterized with the subjects in two states of vitamin C nutriture: a depleted state, which was achieved by 4-5 wk of compliance with a vitamin C-restricted diet of less than 10 mg/d and a supplemented state, in which the subjects were given 500 mg vitamin C/d for 3 wk. Plasma and urine samples were collected for 72 h after the dose of vitamin C from depleted subjects and for 24 h from supplemented subjects and analyzed for vitamin C. Several of the pharmacokinetic indices measured were different in depleted vs supplemented subjects but none exhibited any age-related differences. This indicates that vitamin C nutriture affects vitamin C pharmacokinetics but age does not.\r"

  ".W": "Vitamin K deficiency has been reported in patients who were treated with antibiotics and placed on poor diets after surgery. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to study the influence of dietary intake on vitamin K concentrations in surgical patients (n = 22). Plasma phylloquinone decreased rapidly from 1.19 +/- 0.16 to 0.47 +/- 0.12 nmol/L (means +/- SEM, n = 11) on a low-phylloquinone diet and from 1.16 +/- 0.12 to 0.36 +/- 0.07 nmol/L (n = 11) by postoperative fasting. A small amount of phylloquinone and a large amount of menaquinone were found in liver tissue. Phylloquinone concentration was 28.0 +/- 4.3 pmol/g liver (wet weight) on the standard diet (n = 7) whereas it was 6.8 +/- 1.1 pmol/g on the low-phylloquinone diet after 3 d (n = 8). Because phylloquinone is rapidly depleted by fasting, it may be difficult to prevent vitamin K deficiency by dietary phylloquinone alone during long-term fasting after surgery.\r"
