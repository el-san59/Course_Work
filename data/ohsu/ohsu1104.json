Four viruses from Anopheles freeborni and a virus from Aedes sierrensis collected in Butte County in the Central Valley of California in 1970-71 were shown to belong to the Northway serotype. The existence of a Northway serotype virus in California had been inferred from previous serologic surveys of deer and horses, but these are the first Northway serotype viruses to be identified from the contiguous United States or from An. freeborni. This is also the first isolation of any virus from Ae. sierrensis. Two viruses from Culiseta inornata collected in Umatilla County, Oregon in 1969 may represent a new serotype in the Bunyamwera serocomplex of the Bunyamwera serogroup. The name \"Stanfield\" is proposed for this serotype, which is closely related to the Cache Valley and Northway bunyavirus serotypes. A virus from Ae. taeniorhynchus collected in San Diego County, California in 1985 was confirmed to belong to the Main Drain serotype. Previously, Main Drain serotype viruses in California have been associated principally with Culicoides variipennis.\r"

  ".W": "Small mammals were trapped during a 21-month period at 27 farm sites in 15 localities within and beyond the known endemic area for Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Prevalence of Junin virus (JV) was assessed by antigen-capture enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) on samples of body fluids and/or organs from 3, 282 captured rodents. Infection in rodent populations was variable (0-3.7%) among localities but, in all cases, was lower than previously reported rates. Overall prevalence was 1.4% in the AHF epidemic area, 0.6% in the historic (currently low incidence of AHF) area, and 0.4% in two localities beyond the previously defined endemic area. These low values underestimate the actual prevalence of JV, as ELISA validation by virus isolation indicated a sensitivity of 30% and a specificity of 99%. Of 37 positive rodents, 28 (76%) were of two species: Calomys musculinus (23 animals) and C. laucha (5 animals). Antigen also was found in three Akodon azarae, four Bolomys obscurus, one Mus musculus, and one Oxymycterus rufus, and JV was isolated from two Oligoryzomys flavescens. Three of these rodent species (B. obscurus, O. flavescens, and O. rufus) have heretofore not been implicated in JV maintenance in the field. Evidence suggests that the AHF endemic area may continue to expand northward.\r"

Laboratory reared F1 An. darlingi and anopheline test species were allowed to feed at the same time on falciparum malaria patients who had gametocytes in their blood, and who had not yet been treated with quinine. Mosquitoes were dissected and examined for oocysts on day 9, and for sporozoites on days 16-20 after feeding. Anopheles mediopunctatus had higher mean numbers of oocysts and oocyst positive rates than An. darlingi. The oocyst positive rate and the mean number of oocysts in An. deaneorum and An. darlingi were similar. Anopheles triannulatus and An. oswaldoi had fewer oocysts than An. darlingi. The salivary gland sporozoite infection rate was similar for An. mediopunctatus and An. deaneorum and much lower for An. triannulatus and An. oswaldoi when compared to An. darlingi. Anopheles albitarsis developed oocysts, but sporozoites did not invade the salivary glands. In relative levels of susceptibility to P. falciparum, An. darlingi was equal to An. mediopunctatus which was greater than An. deaneorum, which was greater than An. triannulatus, which was greater than An. oswaldoi.\r"

Comparisons have been made between the performance of each technique with respect to sensitivity and specificity against DNA dot-blots and mosquito squashes. Their relative costs, economy, and ease of use were analyzed in an attempt to develop an appropriate non-radioactive system for use in the field. Enzyme-labeled probes that were detected directly by label activity proved more suitable than probes requiring reporter molecules for detection. Binding of reporter molecules to mosquito squashes caused the appearance of false positives and, in addition, their binding to nylon filters caused high background coloration. Chemiluminescent detection provided an attractive alternative to colorimetric detection. Both systems analyzed were rapid, simple, and economic. However, less severe treatment of filters was required for reprobing with chemiluminescence. The greatest sensitivity achieved was with chemiluminescent detection in which the limit of detection was 0.15 ng of target DNA. This study suggests that a synthetic DNA probe coupled to a chemiluminescent detection system should provide a sufficiently simple, sensitive, and reliable technique for insect vector identification in the field.\r"

Among 45 Malaysian isolates, one epitope of Pfs 25, designated region I, showed evidence of variable reactivity with MAbs among different isolates; the Pfs 25 epitope, region II, was universally recognized by MAbs in all isolates. Two apparently distinct epitope regions of Pfs 230 were defined by MAbs, one of which was universally recognized by MAbs among the 45 isolates; the other was conserved in all but three isolates. The epitope regions of gamete-surface protein Pfs 48/45, designated regions I, IIa, IIb, IIc, III, and IV, were examined for reactivity by IFA in 33 isolates.

Three engineered constructs representing different but overlapping regions of the circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium vivax were used to immunize the Saimiri monkeys. Monkeys were randomly placed into three immunization groups: rPvCS2, rPvCS3, and LCV3 (representing three different but overlapping portions of the P. vivax CS protein) and two control groups: an alum adjuvant control group and an unimmunized control group. Collections of PBMC were made throughout the study at weeks 0, 2, 8, challenge (week 16), and two weeks after challenge. Proliferative responses to all immunogens and pokeweed mitogen were measured in all monkeys. Fourteen of 18 monkeys immunized with either rPvCS2 or rPvCS3 responded on the day of challenge to the appropriate immunogen with a stimulation index less than 2. Immunization with LCV3, which represents the repeat region only, elicited a specific response in only one monkey. However monkeys in both control groups also responded to rPvCS2 and rPvCS3, regardless of immunization, suggesting the presence of epitopes in rPvCS2 and rPvCS3 capable of associating with differing MHC antigens. Furthermore, the frequency of these cells in the periphery was increased by immunization, as demonstrated by a greater number of responding monkeys in the rPvCS2 and rPvCS3 immunized groups.\r"

All volunteers lived in Arso PIR, Irian Jaya. A 25 mg/kg dose of chloroquine base was administered over a three-day period to 92 volunteers positive for P. falciparum rings (greater than 10 rings/200 white blood cells). Fifty volunteers (54%) showed results consistent with resistance. Twenty-nine were classified RII, and 21 RIII. In November 1989, a single curative dose of Fansidar was administered to 59 volunteers divided among three groups with 18 months, four years, and life-long exposure to endemic malaria. The proportion of volunteers in each group still positive for P. falciparum on day 7 of followup was 54%, 0%, and 14%, respectively. Thus, immune status profoundly effected clinically response to Fansidar. Standard in vitro microtests were also performed on parasites from 11 volunteers against chloroquine, amodiaquine, quinine, pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine, and and mefloquine. Nine of ten isolates showed in vitro growth consistent with resistance to chloroquine. Tests with other drugs showed few isolates with results considered indicative of susceptibility. Arso PIR has a severe drug resistance problem.\r"

Six isolates from humans (3), Didelphis marsupialis (1), Lutzomyia olmeca nociva (1), and Lu, reducta (1) showed reactivity patterns and isoenzyme profiles similar to those obtained with the Leishmania amazonensis reference strains, and were identified as this species. Eighty-six stocks were classified as members of the L. braziliensis complex; of these, 61 were L. guyanensis or variants, which presented three serodeme subtypes, but whose isoenzyme profiles were all similar to the reference strain. A total of 15 isolates were distinguished as L. braziliensis or variants and were classified into five serodeme subtypes. The isolate from Psychodopugus davisi appeared, from the numerical analysis, to be a distinct parasite species. Ten isolates showed reactivity patterns and isoenzyme profiles similar to those obtained with the L. naiffi reference strain. A parasite isolated from Ps. claustrei appeared to be different from all reference strains by both techniques, and was classified as probably being a new species. The importance of these results with respect to the taxonomic status of the New World Leishmania, and their implications for both clinical and epidemiologic data are discussed.\r"

The notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began, with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken, i.e., initial dose less than 10 mg of DEC, very gradual dose increases, and associated anti-allergic treatment. This type of drug-induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regions. It occurs primarily, but not exclusively, in subjects presenting with a high microfilarial load. The relationship between the occurrence of encephalitis and the decrease in microfilaremia is evident. The pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature.\r"

A sensitive and specific antigen detection assay has been developed for W. bancrofti, which is based on a monoclonal antibody (AD12) that binds to a repeated epitope on a 200 kDa adult worm excretion product present in sera from infected humans. The only formal evaluation of this assay to date was performed with sera from India. In the present study, we have evaluated the performance of the AD12 antigen assay in two laboratories with sera collected in endemic and non-endemic areas in Egypt. Antigen was detected in 57 of 59 (97%) sera from microfilaremic subjects, and in 22 of 139 asymptomatic and amicrofilaremic subjects who reside in a highly endemic area. Antigen titers were significantly correlated with microfilaria counts (r = 0.41, P less than 0.01). Filarial antigen was not detected in most sera from amicrofilaremic subjects with clinical filariasis. Comparative antigen test results obtained from laboratories in Cairo and St. Louis agreed in 170 of 173 sera tested. Filarial antigen was not detected in sera from Egyptians with no history of residence in filaria-endemic areas. Specifically, nonendemic sera from patients with other parasitic infections (schistosomiasis, fascioliasis, ascariasis, etc.) were uniformly negative in the assay. We conclude that the AD12 filarial antigen assay is sensitive and specific for W. bancrofti infection in Egypt.\r"

When rats were killed one month after challenge, there were 80.4% and 46.1% reductions in the number of cystic and total metacestodes of T. taeniaeformis in the liver, respectively. When five rats were killed 16 months after challenge, they showed almost complete immunity against the challenge, with 99.4% and 91.1% reductions in the number of cystic and total metacestodes, respectively. There were only a few degenerated, pin-point metacestodes of T. taeniaeformis in the liver of all five rats; one harbored one cystic metacestode as well. However, there were no such reductions in rats injected initially with cyst fluid antigens of T. crassiceps with Freund's complete adjuvant. An additional experiment was carried out using 500 eggs of T. taeniaeformis in order to confirm the vaccine effect against higher egg dose. There were 96.6%, 87.9%, 83.9%, and 79.3% reductions in the number of cystic metacestodes in rats initially inoculated with 10 viable, 10 formalized, and 10 frozen metacestodes, and injected with sodium deoxycholate-solubilized metacestode antigens, respectively. It is strongly suggested that rats singly dosed with 10 viable or non-viable, intact metacestodes of T. crassiceps without adjuvant became highly resistant to challenge infection with eggs of T. taeniaeformis, which resulted in almost no cystic metacestode establishment.\r"

The hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation and the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine pretreatment were studied after CABG surgery and overnight mechanical ventilation. Twenty-five patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 13) patients who had tracheal extubation after pretreatment with a placebo; group 2 patients who received lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) before tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic data, electrocardiographic tracings, and arterial blood gases were obtained before tracheal extubation, during suctioning, and 1, 5, and 20 min after tracheal extubation. Group 1 patients displayed significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, rate-pressure product, right atrial pressure, and cardiac index during suctioning and within 1 min of tracheal extubation, returning to preextubation level by 5 min. There were no significant changes in pulmonary and systemic resistance indices. Hemodynamic changes in group 2 patients were similar to those in group 1. Both in the absence and presence of lidocaine, tracheal extubation caused hemodynamic responses that were small in magnitude and brief in duration. These responses were not associated with electrocardiographic or enzymatic evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction, or with ventricular dysrhythmias. Compared with the well-documented hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, we found that extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery was associated with less pronounced responses. This may be related to avoidance of laryngoscopy and possibly accommodation to the endo-tracheal tube. These modest hemodynamic responses of extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery were not modified by intravenous lidocaine.\r"

Regional function of normal and ischemic myocardium was assessed by sonomicrometry. The hemodynamic effects of isoflurane (2% inspired concentration) were more pronounced in the acutely than in the chronically instrumented dogs. Decreases in mean arterial pressure (-47% +/- 5% in the acute and -22% +/- 4% in the chronic preparation, P less than 0.01), left ventricular contractility (-51% +/- 6% and -33% +/- 4%, P less than 0.01), and coronary perfusion pressure (-59% +/- 6% and -12% +/- 9%, P less than 0.01) were more distinct in the acutely instrumented animals. Although the reduction of regional function during isoflurane anesthesia was similar in normal myocardium in both preparations (-33% +/- 4% acute and -34% +/- 6% chronic preparation, not a significant difference), an exaggerated dysfunction was observed in the ischemic myocardium of the acutely instrumented dogs (-66% +/- 2% and -30% +/- 4%, P less than 0.01). It is concluded that acutely instrumented dogs respond to the hemodynamic effects of isoflurane, resulting in ischemic myocardial dysfunction, significantly more than do chronically instrumented dogs.\r"

Arterial plasma levels of bupivacaine were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Statistically significant increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate above baseline measurements occurred in the control group during the period between scalp incision and dural reflection (P less than 0.05). Both concentrations of bupivacaine prevented these increases. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate during scalp incision and scalp reflection were significantly higher in the control group than in both bupivacaine groups (P less than 0.05). Peak bupivacaine plasma levels (mean +/- SD) occurred either 5 or 10 min after infiltration and were significantly higher in the 0.25% group (0.48 +/- 0.31 microgram/mL) than the 0.125% group (0.14 +/- 0.13 microgram/mL) (P less than 0.05). These results suggest that bupivacaine infiltration blocks the hemodynamic response to craniotomy. A concentration of 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine is as effective as 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine at reducing the hemodynamic response to craniotomy. Because the lower concentration of bupivacaine produces lower blood levels, we recommend 0.125% bupivacaine with 1:400,000 epinephrine as a useful, safe adjunct to general anesthesia in children undergoing craniotomy.\r"

Anesthesia was induced with either propofol or methohexital (2 mg/kg), followed by a maintenance infusion of 100 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. Vecuronium (0.05 mg/kg) was administered and ventilation (FIO2, 1.0) was manually controlled (FECO2, 0.04-0.05). Data acquisitions were serially obtained over 15 min. Propofol and methohexital anesthesia caused an average 15% decrease in mean arterial pressure, associated with a 20% decrease in cardiac index without a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index. It is interesting that the determinants of these hemodynamic effects were different. Heart rate did not change during propofol infusion despite the decrease in mean arterial pressure, whereas heart rate increased during methohexital infusion. In the propofol group, the decrease in cardiac index was associated with decreases in indicators of preload (end-diastolic volume and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure), whereas end-systolic volume and global ejection fraction did not change statistically. In the methohexital group, the decrease in cardiac index was associated with a decrease in global ejection fraction and an increase in end-systolic volume, whereas indicators of preload remained unchanged. It is concluded that methohexital reduces left ventricular performance. In contrast, propofol preserves left ventricular performance despite a likely negative inotropic effect.\r"

Neuromuscular blockade was monitored by recording the electromyographic activity (Datex NMT) of the adductor pollicis muscle resulting from supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 2 Hz for 2 s at 10-s intervals. Effective vecuronium infusion requirements averaged 1.5 +/- 0.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 (mean +/- SEM) during isoflurane-narcotic-nitrous oxide anesthesia, 1.9 +/- 0.1 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 during halothane-narcotic-nitrous oxide anesthesia, and 2.4 +/- 0.3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 during narcotic-nitrous oxide anesthesia. Infusion requirements significantly decreased after the first 30 min of infusion in the presence of both potent inhalation anesthetics, but did not change with time during narcotic-nitrous oxide anesthesia. There was no evidence of decreasing infusion requirements during prolonged vecuronium infusion (2.5 h). There was no difference in the rate of spontaneous or pharmacologically induced recovery between anesthetic groups. The mean recovery index (T25-75) after termination of the infusion was 13.7 min.\r"

Based both on subjective estimates (tiredness, fear, anxiety, dryness of mouth) and, especially, on metabolic responses (energy expenditure, oxygen consumption), oral diazepam appears to be superior to the combination of an opiate (meperidine) plus an anticholinergic (atropine). Atropine plus meperidine significantly increased energy expenditure above predicted values (2061 +/- 365 vs 1714 +/- 361 kcal/24 h, P = 0.004), calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, based on sex, weight, height, and age, as well as increased oxygen consumption above levels seen with diazepam premedication (160 +/- 29 vs 137 +/- 17 mL.min-1. m-2).

Twenty-eight adult patients undergoing orthopedic surgery under controlled hypotension were studied. Systolic blood pressure was reduced to two-thirds of baseline values with an infusion of nitroglycerin during nitrous oxide/enflurane anesthesia. Intraarterial blood pressures were simultaneously measured in either the right or the left radial artery with a cannula and a Gould P23XL calibrated transducer; tonometric monitoring was performed on the contralateral radial artery using a Colin CBM-3000 instrument. The outputs of the two blood pressure measurement instruments were recorded for later data analysis. The shape of the tonometric pressure waveform was nearly identical to the waveform recorded intraarterially even during controlled hypotension. Regression analyses of 2039 paired tonometric and intraarterial blood pressure values during the hypotensive period showed good correlations (r = 0.78 for systolic, r = 0.81 for mean, and r = 0.70 for diastolic pressures). The accuracy of systolic, mean, and diastolic readings was from 4 to 7 mm Hg with negligible bias and did not differ significantly among six systolic, four mean, and four diastolic pressure groups. Our results indicate that arterial tonometry can provide accurate, reliable, and real-time monitoring of blood pressure even during controlled hypotension.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of various ratios of mixtures of SNP and trimethaphan on heart rate (HR), renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), and renal artery blood flow to find the best ratio of SNP and trimethaphan for producing induced hypotension. Five mixtures with different ratios of SNP and trimethaphan, as well as each drug alone, were given intravenously to mongrel dogs in amounts adequate to achieve a stable mean arterial blood pressure of 75 +/- 5 mm Hg. Sodium nitroprusside alone significantly increased HR (163% +/- 14.5%) and RSNA (222% +/- 24%). Trimethaphan alone significantly decreased RSNA (11.6% +/- 4.5%). There were significant positive correlations between SNP-to-trimethaphan ratios and percent changes in HR (r2 = 0.301, P less than 0.01) and in RSNA (r2 = 0.648, P less than 0.01). Renal artery blood flow was well maintained with all ratios. Sodium nitroprusside and trimethaphan interacted synergistically to produce hypotension. However, they antagonize each other in their effects on arterial baroreflex-mediated changes in HR and RSNA. According to linear regression lines, HR changed least with a SNP-to-trimethaphan ratio of 1:5, and RSNA changed least with SNP-to-trimethaphan ratios of 1:2.5 and 1:5. Our results indicate that mixtures of SNP and trimethaphan in ratios of approximately 1:2.5 to 1:5 may produce induced hypotension with stable reflex sympathetic nerve activity.\r"

However, few studies have investigated the actions of these agents on central cardiovascular control sites. The present investigation examined the actions of these agents on the responses of systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate, infrarenal aortic blood flow, and lower body vascular resistance to central nervous system pressor site stimulation in chronically instrumented cats. Male and female cats (n = 23) were chronically instrumented with bipolar stimulating electrodes in the regions of the ventrolateral hypothalamus (anterior, 10.0 mm; lateral, 2.5 mm; depth, -4.0 mm) and mesencephalic reticular formation (anterior, 2.0 mm; lateral, 2.0 mm; depth, -1.0 mm). Control experiments consisted of stimulation sequences at 1x, 2x, and 4x threshold current levels to elicit pressor responses. Stimulation of the hypothalamic site produced current-dependent increases in SAP (6-85 mm Hg), in heart rate (3-56 beats/min), and in infrarenal aortic blood flow (0-85 mL/min). Reticular formation site stimulation produced graded increases in SAP (6-129 mm Hg) only. Isoflurane (1.5%, 2.5%, and 3.0%), etomidate (3.0-mg/kg bolus and 0.4-mg.kg-1. h-1 infusion), and midazolam (7.5-mg/kg bolus and 0.2-mg.kg-1.h-1 infusion) were then administered in separate experimental groups. After a steady hemodynamic state was established with each agent, stimulation sequences were repeated. Isoflurane produced an attenuation of the responses of SAP (from 85.1 +/- 8.2 to 17.8 +/- 6.1 mm Hg at 1.5%, to 7.2 +/- 2.0 mm Hg at 2.5%, and to 4.7 +/- 2.0 mm Hg at 3%, all P less than 0.05), heart rate (from 41.1 +/- 13.0 to 12.5 +/- 2.7 beats/min at 2.5% and to 6.2 +/- 1.7 beats/min at 3%, all P less than 0.05), and of the infrarenal aortic blood flow (from 72.6 +/- 14.3 to 11.8 +/- 4.2 mL/min at 1.5%, to 10.2 +/- 5.6 mL/min at 2.5%, and to 3.2 +/- 1.5 mL/min at 3%, all P less than 0.05) to the highest level of hypothalamic site stimulation. Isoflurane similarly produced an attenuation of the SAP response (from 128.7 +/- 10.3 to 15.4 +/- 8.1 mm Hg at 1.5%, to 0.2 +/- 1.1 mm Hg at 2.5%, and to 0.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg at 3.0%, all P less than 0.05) to the highest level of reticular formation site stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Left ventricular pressure, rate of change of pressure (dP/dt), heart rate, and perfusion pressure were measured in the presence of increasing drug concentrations. Under control conditions, both (dP/dt)max and heart rate were increased most with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and least with amrinone. In isoflurane-pretreated hearts (1.3%, vol/vol), the phosphodiesterase inhibitors increased (dP/dt)max to a larger degree, whereas the increase in heart rate remained similar to that in the control hearts. After exposure to halothane (0.8%, vol/vol), however, amrinone and milrinone were less effective with respect to enhancement of contractile performance. There was no difference in the 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine-induced increase of (dP/dt)max between hearts exposed to isoflurane and those exposed to halothane. Our results suggest that contractile performance of isolated hearts is more easily stimulated by milrinone and amrinone in the presence of isoflurane than in the presence of halothane.\r"

The patients were allocated randomly to receive either epidural or iv alfentanil. In both groups, a loading dose of 15 micrograms.kg-1 was administered, followed by a constant rate infusion of 18 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 alfentanil for 20 h. Both routes provided similar degrees of analgesia; however, analgesia occurred earlier in the intravenously treated group (P less than 0.03). Mean plasma alfentanil concentrations (Cps) varied between 42 and 82 ng.ml-1 in the iv group and 23 and 68 ng.ml-1 in the epidural group, with higher concentrations in the iv group for the first 60 min only (P less than 0.01). Cps increased with infusion time, suggesting accumulation of alfentanil. After infusion ended, pain recurred at the same time in both groups, whereas the alfentanil Cps still were greater than 45 ng/ml. Postoperative epinephrine concentrations decreased after 60 min of infusion (P less than 0.02), whereas, after 6 h, cortisol levels decreased to preoperative values. Norepinephrine concentrations decreased only slightly. The only clinically meaningful effect on vital signs that occurred was an abrupt reduction of respiratory rate after the iv loading dose. PaCO2 increased to the same extent in both groups during the first 15 min only. The incidence of opioid-related side effects was similar in both groups. These results suggest that the iv and epidural routes were equally effective for providing postoperative pain control and controlling the postoperative response to surgical stress.\r"

Ventilatory drive was measured before and after administration of midazolam, as well as 3, 30, 60, and 120 min after administration of flumazenil or placebo. Seven to 30 days later, the study was repeated, with subjects receiving placebo or flumazenil (whichever they had not received during their first trial). Midazolam caused significant decreases in the slope of the CO2 response (-29 +/- 5%; P less than 0.005); minute ventilation (VE) at end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2) = 46 mmHg (-28 +/- 4%; P less than 0.001), and tidal volume at PETCO2 = 46 mmHg (-44 +/- 4%; P less than 0.005). Three minutes after intravenous administration of flumazenil 1.0 mg, VE46 and tidal volume increased to 108 +/- 6% and 105 +/- 6%, respectively, of their premidazolam values; at the same time after administration of placebo, VE46 and tidal volume remained significantly depressed (between groups, P less than 0.005 for each variable). Thirty minutes later, these variables did not differ between groups, probably because the effects of flumazenil and midazolam were diminishing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MAC was determined in 47 infants and small children (mean ages 16.6 +/- 6.7 months) during isoflurane and oxygen anesthesia (n = 11) and isoflurane and nitrous oxide anesthesia (25% nitrous oxide [n = 12], 50% nitrous oxide [n = 12], and 75% nitrous oxide [n = 12]). After assigning patients to one of four groups, anesthesia was induced with increasing inspired concentrations of isoflurane in oxygen. After anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation, ventilation was controlled (carbon dioxide partial pressure = 32 +/- 5 mmHg), and nitrous oxide was added to the inspired gas mixture to achieve end-expired nitrous oxide concentrations of 0, 25, 50, or 75%. Inspired and expired gas samples were obtained from a distal sampling port in the tracheal tube. The response to skin incision in each patient was assessed at a previously selected end-tidal concentration of isoflurane. The MAC of isoflurane was determined in each group using the up-and-down method described for evaluating quantal responses. The mean duration of constant end-tidal concentrations prior to skin incision was 14 +/- 7 min (range 6-46 min). The ratio of expired to inspired nitrous oxide and isoflurane concentrations during the period of constant end-tidal concentrations was 0.96 +/- 0.01 and 0.93 +/- 0.03 respectively. The MAC of isoflurane in oxygen was 1.69 +/- 0.13 vol% (mean +/- standard deviation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighty patients, randomly assigned to one of four groups of 20 each, received 0.12, 0.16, 0.20, or 0.24 mg/kg ORG9426. In the first study, the doses (in milligrams per kilogram) of ORG9426 that caused 50% (ED50), 90% (ED90), or 95% (ED95) neuromuscular block were determined by the individual dose-response method; they were 0.170, 0.268, and 0.305 mg/kg, respectively. In the second study, after induction of anesthesia, patients received 0.6 mg/kg (about 2 x ED95) of ORG9426, either in a single bolus (group 1) or in two unequal (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) increments 4 min apart (group 2). After the administration of 0.6 mg/kg ORG9426, maximal neuromuscular block developed in 1.5 +/- 0.12 min in group 1 and in 1.2 +/- 0.14 min in group 2. Patients tracheas were intubated after development of the maximal neuromuscular effect of the intubating dose and after the recording of heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Ninety-two healthy patients were randomized to receive either: 1) propofol induction and propofol-nitrous oxide maintenance (control), 2) propofol induction and desflurane-nitrous oxide maintenance, 3) desflurane-nitrous oxide, or 4) desflurane alone for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Inhalation induction with desflurane-nitrous oxide was faster than with desflurane alone (100 +/- 35 vs. 124 +/- 43 s). Inhalation inductions were associated with a high incidence of apnea (17 and 26%), breath-holding (26 and 39%), and coughing (30 and 22%) in groups 3 and 4, respectively. The emergence time after discontinuation of desflurane in oxygen (4.5 +/- 2.1 min.) was significantly less than that after propofol-nitrous oxide (7.3 +/- 3.9 min.). However, times from arrival in the recovery room until the patients were judged fit for discharge were similar for all four treatment groups. Digit-symbol substitution test results and sedation visual analogue scores also were similar during the first 2 h in the recovery room. A lower incidence of moderate-to-severe nausea was reported in group 1 (15% vs. 52, 52, and 59% in groups 2, 3, and 4, respectively). In conclusion, induction of anesthesia with desflurane was rapid but is associated with a high incidence of airway irritation. Emergence and recovery profiles after maintenance of anesthesia with desflurane compared favorably to a propofol-nitrous oxide combination. However, propofol was associated with a lower incidence of nausea than was desflurane after outpatient anesthesia for laparoscopic surgery.\r"

We compared the effects of propofol with and without N2O and droperidol to the effects of a conventional regimen consisting of halothane-N2O-droperidol on the recovery characteristics and the incidence of postoperative emesis after strabismus surgery in 120 ASA physical status 1 or 2 children. After induction of anesthesia with halothane-N2O, patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups. Group A (control) received halothane, 66% N2O, and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1; group B, propofol 2 mg.kg-1 bolus followed by infusion of 160 microgram.kg-1.min-1; group C, propofol (as in group B) and 66% N2O; and group D, propofol (as in group B), 66% N2O (as in group C), and droperidol 75 micrograms.kg-1. Patients in group B had more episodes of intraoperative oculocardiac reflex responses than patients in group A, but had shorter times to extubation, oral intake, ambulation, and discharge, as well as a lower incidence of postoperative emesis (P less than 0.05). The addition of N2O to the propofol anesthetic regimen (group C) was associated with an increased incidence of emesis (P less than 0.05), whereas the addition of droperidol to the propofol-N2O regimen (group D) did not affect the incidence of emesis compared to the other three groups. We conclude that maintenance of anesthesia with a total intravenous regimen using propofol results in a more rapid recovery and less postoperative emesis than with a halothane-N2O-droperidol regimen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Accordingly, we studied heart rate (HR) responses to intravenous atropine in 80 patients assigned randomly to either a control group, who received no medication (n = 20), or a clonidine group, who received oral clonidine of approximately 1.2 micrograms.kg-1 (n = 20), 2.5 micrograms.kg-1 (n = 20), or 5 micrograms.kg-1 (n = 20). All patients received incremental doses of atropine, 2.5, 2.5, and 5 micrograms.kg-1, at 2-min intervals (total dose 10 micrograms.kg-1). Positive chronotropic response to the cumulative atropine dose of 10 micrograms.kg-1 was attenuated significantly only in patients given clonidine 5 micrograms.kg-1 (7 +/- 1 beats per min, mean +/- standard error) when compared with those given smaller doses of clonidine (15 +/- 2, 16 +/- 2 beats per min) or no clonidine (19 +/- 2 beats per min) (P less than 0.05). To determine whether HR hyporesponsiveness to atropine induced by clonidine can be overcome by a larger dose of atropine, the authors studied 30 additional patients given clonidine 5 micrograms.kg-1 or no medication. In all patients not receiving clonidine (n = 15), HR increased by more than 20 beats per min when atropine of 15 micrograms.kg-1 was administered, whereas in only 5 patients (33%) receiving clonidine did the HR increase by 20 beats per min after atropine 15 micrograms.kg-1 (P less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) is a novel, noninvasive dosage form of fentanyl used to provide children and adults with sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia. In order to determine the bioavailability and absorption of fentanyl from OTFC, 12 volunteers were given intravenous fentanyl citrate or OTFC 15 micrograms/kg on each of two occasions. On a third occasion, the authors assessed oral administration (gastrointestinal absorption) by giving eight of the same volunteers the same dose of a solution of fentanyl citrate to swallow. In each study, arterial blood samples were taken over 24 h for analysis of plasma fentanyl. After intravenous (iv) administration of fentanyl, clearance (mean +/- standard deviation) was 0.67 +/- 0.15 l/min; volume of distribution at steady state was 287 +/- 79 l; and the terminal elimination half-life was 425 +/- 102 min. Peak plasma concentrations of fentanyl were higher (3.0 +/- 1.0 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, P = 0.01) and occurred sooner (22 +/- 2.5 vs. 101 +/- 48.8 min, P = 0.003) after OTFC than after oral solution administration. Plasma concentrations of fentanyl after OTFC decreased rapidly, to less than 1.0 ng/ml within 75-135 min after the beginning of administration. Peak absorption rate was greater (11.1 +/- 4.3 vs. 3.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms/min, P = 0.004) and occurred much sooner after OTFC than after oral solution administration (19 +/- 2.6 vs. 87.5 +/- 38.1 min, P = 0.001). Systemic bioavailability was greater after OTFC administration than after the oral solution (0.52 +/- 0.1 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.1, P = 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

As an initial clinical validation of the linear, continuous, 14-compartment basic model, the current study examined its predictive performance in 50 patients by comparing quantitatively the predicted and the measured alveolar concentration-time profiles after bolus injections of liquid isoflurane into the closed system during mechanical ventilation. The two versions of the model studied differed in the size of their peripheral shunt, as 0% (version A) and 16% (version B) of the cardiac output. A total of 15,744 alveolar concentrations of isoflurane (one per 10s period) were measured by mass spectrometry. For each measured concentration we used computer simulations of version A and version B to calculate a predicted concentration for both versions. For each patient we calculated the bias (indicating over- or underprediction) and the scatter of the prediction errors (indicating the typical error size). The bias and the scatter of the prediction errors, both given as mean (and standard deviation), were 2.25 (13.59) and 12.51 (5.84)% for version A and 12.00 (14.97) and 14.12 (6.54)% for B. Version A performed better than B: both the bias (P = 0.008) and the scatter (P less than 0.0001) were closer to zero for A. Logistic regression analysis showed for version A that scatter, but not bias, increased with age (P = 0.002). Gender, body mass index (weight x height-2), and number of injections per hour did not influence scatter or bias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of atropine on heart rate, heart rhythm, and systolic blood pressure were compared among dosage groups, and a dose-response curve for peak heart rate was constructed. The effects of atropine were compared also between younger and older subjects. For the group of all 181 subjects, atropine increased heart rate in a dose-related manner up to 30 micrograms.kg-1. Fifty percent maximal response corresponded to 9 micrograms.kg-1, and 90% maximal response corresponded to 26 micrograms.kg-1. Some subjects had nonsinus supraventricular rhythms before atropine, but none had nonsinus rhythm after atropine except after the smallest dose, 5 micrograms.kg-1. Systolic blood pressure increased significantly after all doses of atropine except 5 mu.kg-1. Subjects less than 6 months old had higher control and peak heart rates than did subjects greater than or equal to 2 yr old, but the older subjects had greater change in heart rate after atropine. For subjects greater than or equal to 2 yr old, all doses of atropine produced a significant increase in heart rate. The same was true for younger subjects, less than 6 months old, except that 5 micrograms.kg-1 did not increase heart rate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

NBF changes produced by lidocaine were dose-dependent.

Epinephrine also produced dose-dependent changes in NBF. Epinephrine 2.5 micrograms/ml produced a transient 20% increase in NBF lasting 2-3 min (P less than 0.05), followed by a return to baseline. Epinephrine 5.0 micrograms/ml and epinephrine 10.0 micrograms/ml produced reductions of 20% and 35%, respectively (P less than 0.05), which lasted throughout the study.

In the current experiment we investigated whether central alpha 1 adrenoceptor stimulation antagonizes the alpha 2 adrenoceptor-mediated hypnotic response. Cirazoline, an alpha 1 adrenoceptor agonist that partitions into the central nervous system, attenuated dexmedetomidine's hypnotic response whether administered systemically (0.3-1 mg.kg-1 intraperitoneally [ip]) or centrally (0.1 mg.kg-1 intracerebroventricularly). Prazosin, an alpha 1 adrenoceptor antagonist that effectively crosses the blood-brain barrier, fully blocked cirazoline's attenuating effect on dexmedetomidine-induced hypnosis, whereas doxazosin, which partitions poorly into the brain, did not block cirazoline's effect. Administration of phenylephrine, 0.3-3 mg.kg-1 ip, an alpha 1 adrenoceptor agonist that does not penetrate into the brain, did not attenuate dexmedetomidine's hypnotic effect. These results indicate that central alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation functionally antagonizes the hypnotic response to an alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. These data underscore the important requirement for alpha 2 adrenoceptor selectivity if these agonists are to be useful in the anesthetic setting.\r"

  ".W": "Direct vasodilation of coronary resistance vessels by anesthetics may reduce coronary flow reserve and interfere with myocardial flow-metabolism coupling. This study was performed to evaluate the potential for the halogenated anesthetic agents sevoflurane, isoflurane, and halothane to alter the regulation of coronary flow via a direct action on coronary resistance vessels. Coronary flow and flow reserve were measured in the quiescent isolated perfused rat heart at anesthetic concentrations between 0 and 3 x MAC. In order to minimize anesthetic-induced secondary changes in coronary resistance, constant coronary perfusion pressure was maintained; the left ventricular cavity was vented; and tetrodotoxin was used to achieve cardiac arrest. These conditions permitted the dissociation of direct anesthetic actions from indirect regulatory processes affecting coronary vascular resistance (CVR). Coronary flow reserve was defined as the difference between coronary flow prior to and during administration of a maximally vasodilating dose of adenosine. Each anesthetic significantly reduced the magnitude of both CVR and coronary flow reserve in a concentration-dependent manner. Sevoflurane reduced coronary flow reserve significantly less than did halothane and isoflurane. At high concentrations (3.0 x MAC), coronary flow reserve was abolished by halothane and was decreased to near zero by isoflurane; however, flow reserve was reduced only 48% from control by sevoflurane. This difference among anesthetics is explained primarily by variations in the magnitude of direct coronary vasodilation produced by each anesthetic, rather than by effects on maximal vasodilator capacity. These data show that sevoflurane's intrinsic vasodilator action on coronary resistance vessels differs substantially from that of halothane and isoflurane.\r"

Blockade of one type of glutamate receptor, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, decreases brain infarct size in experimental models of permanent focal ischemia, but protection in models of transient reversible ischemia is ambiguous. We investigated the effect of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist dizocipiline (MK-801) on neuronal damage in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus, using two models of reversible cerebral ischemia: 10 or 15 min of bilateral common carotid occlusion combined with hypotension, or 6-8.5 min of cardiac arrest. Histopathologic evaluation of neuronal damage was performed 7 days after the ischemic insults. Thirteen groups of rats (a total of 129 animals) were treated with saline or dizocilpine in single or multiple doses ranging from 0.1 to 5 mg.kg-1, given intravenously or intraperitoneally prior to and/or after the ischemic insult. In none of the dizocilpine-treated groups could neuronal protection be demonstrated in the CA1 region of the septal as well as dorsotemporal hippocampus, compared to a corresponding saline-treated group. We conclude that systemically administered noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists do not provide a marked protection against neuronal damage after a transient period of severe forebrain ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Heparin, currently used in extracorporeal blood circulation procedures, may lead to hemorrhagic complications. Protamine, used for reversal of heparin-induced anticoagulation at the end of such procedures, can cause adverse hemodynamic responses. To prevent both types of complications, we have developed a reactor device containing immobilized protamine (i.e., a protamine bio-reactor) that can be placed at the distal end of the circuit, thus providing simultaneous extracorporeal heparin removal and protamine treatment. In preliminary in vivo studies involving dogs at a blood flow of 100 ml/min, the bio-reactor removed about 50% of the administered dose of heparin (i.e., 100 units/kg) in 10 min. While rapid injection of protamine in dogs anticoagulated with heparin produced a transient and significant (P less than 0.005) decreases in systemic arterial blood pressure (-39.5 +/- 9.2 mmHg), cardiac output (-1.59 +/- 0.23 L/min), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (-7.5 +/- 1.3%) and increases in pulmonary artery systolic (+12.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg) and diastolic pressures (+10.0 +/- 3.6 mmHg), the use of the protamine bio-reactor did not elicit any statistically significant change in any of the variables measured. Hemolysis was not significant, as reflected by a statistically insignificant change of the animals' red blood cell counts, hematocrits, and total hemoglobin values. In addition, hemolytic complement was found to be reduced only by 10% in animals with the protamine bio-reactor, whereas it was reduced rapidly by 20% in animals receiving intravenous protamine administration and progressively by 20% in control animals with a sham reactor that contained no protamine. Furthermore, the use of the protamine bio-reactor also significantly reduced the protamine-induced transient thrombocytopenic and granulocytopenic responses. The white blood cell counts and platelet counts decreased to 87.7 +/- 7.5 and 83.3 +/- 5.0% of baseline, respectively, in dogs with the protamine bio-reactor compared to 35.5 +/- 14.3 and 32.1 +/- 8.1% of baseline in dogs receiving intravenous protamine. The protamine bio-reactor may provide a unique means to simultaneously control both heparin- and protamine-induced complications.\r"

  ".W": "Knowledge of anesthetic effects on the automaticity of dominant and subsidiary cardiac pacemakers is fundamental to an understanding of mechanisms of arrhythmia during anesthesia, as well as to the management of patients with sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular (AV) conduction block. Among potential pacemakers of the heart are subsidiary atrial pacemakers (SAP), which are located outside the classic sinoatrial (SA) node region but still within the right atrium. SAP have a higher inherent rate of automaticity than AV junctional pacemakers, may contribute to a multicentric atrial pacemaker complex, and can control the rhythm of the heart when the SA node is absent or inhibited. How halothane, epinephrine (E), or norepinephrine (NE), alone or in combination, would affect the relation between the automaticity of the SA node and SAP was tested using an isolated, perfused canine right atrial preparation (n = 78). This preparation was perfused via the SA node artery with Krebs' solution (36.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C) equilibrated with 97% oxygen-3% carbon dioxide. Delivered concentrations of halothane of 1 or 2% corresponded to measured perfusate concentrations of 0.50 +/- 0.02 or 0.80 +/- 0.04 mM in experiments with E (n = 24) and 0.45 +/- 0.02 or 0.75 +/- 0.04 mM in experiments with NE (n = 54). E or NE perfusate concentrations were 1, 2, and 5 micrograms/l or 2, 5, and 10 micrograms/l, respectively. To determine the site of earliest activation (SEA), extracellular recordings were made from the SA node region and distal sites (approximately 1, 2, and 3 cm) along the sulcus terminalis, the previously reported locations of SAP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Atrial tachyarrhythmias are a common manifestation of digitalis toxicity. Such arrhythmias could be due to enhanced automaticity of subsidiary atrial pacemakers (SAP) compared to the sinoatrial (SA) node. Halothane is known to oppose digitalis-induced ventricular arrhythmias. Its effect on digitalis-caused atrial arrhythmias is unknown. Therefore, we tested two hypotheses, as follows. First, increasing ouabain concentrations would enhance automaticity of SAP compared to the SA node and that such enhanced automaticity could explain digitalis-caused atrial tachyarrhythmias. Second, halothane would oppose such enhanced automaticity of SAP, thereby opposing digitalis-caused atrial tachyarrhythmias. A canine right atrial preparation was perfused via the SA node artery with Krebs' solution (36.0 +/- 0.5 degrees C) equilibrated with 97% oxygen-3% carbon dioxide. Four bipolar extracellular electrodes recorded the site of earliest activation (SEA), which in this preparation could be the SA node or increasingly remote sites of SAP approximately 1, 2, and 3 cm distal to the SA node along the sulcus terminalis. Pacemaker shifts to SAP during exposure to drugs were scored for magnitude of shift as 1, 2, or 3 depending on which SAP site was the SEA. Magnitude scores were summed for each test condition and normalized by dividing the total number of preparations tested. Preparations (n = 48) were exposed to 1 or 2% halothane (perfusate concentrations of 0.51 +/- 0.01 or 0.79 +/- 0.03 mM, respectively) and/or to low- or mid-therapeutic (2.5 or 5 x 10(-8) M) or borderline toxic ouabain (1 x 10(-7) M).

  ".W": "Recently, there has been increasing interest in the alterations in splanchnic and hepatic circulation and preservation of hepatic oxygenation and function during anesthesia and surgery. However, the effects of volatile anesthetics under a condition of marginal hepatic oxygen supply are not well understood. Using a crossover design, we therefore studied the effects of equianesthetic concentrations (1.5 MAC) of halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane on hepatic oxygenation and function in nine beagles in which the hepatic artery had been ligated. Portal blood flow was measured by an electro-magnetic flow meter. Hepatic function was assessed by indocyanine green elimination kinetics. While cardiac output and mean arterial pressure were greater during halothane anesthesia than during isoflurane and sevoflurane anesthesia, portal blood flow and hepatic oxygen supply were significantly less during halothane and sevoflurane anesthesia than during isoflurane anesthesia. With regard to hepatic oxygen uptake, there was a significant difference between halothane (2.7 +/- 1.2 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1) and sevoflurane (3.7 +/- 2.0 ml.min-1 x 100 g-1; P less than 0.05). Consequently, the hepatic oxygen supply/uptake ratio and the hemoglobin oxygen saturation and oxygen partial pressure in hepatic venous blood during sevoflurane anesthesia were significantly less than they were with the other anesthetics. Indocyanine green clearance was better preserved during sevoflurane anesthesia (39.7 +/- 12.0 ml.min-1) than during halothane anesthesia (30.9 +/- 8.4 ml.min-1; P less than 0.05). We conclude that sevoflurane is accompanied by a smaller oxygen supply/uptake ratio than is halothane and isoflurane, while it preserves hepatic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied 24 mongrel dogs anesthetized with 0.5% halothane and 60% nitrous oxide. In group 1 (n = 12), hemorrhage reduced mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 45 mmHg for 30 min. In group 2 (n = 12), ICP was increased and maintained constant at 15 mmHg, whereas hemorrhage reduced MAP to 55 mmHg for 30 min (cerebral perfusion pressure [CPP] approximately 40 mmHg in each group).

  ".W": "Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist that decreases central sympathetic activity and reduces the anesthetic requirement for halothane. We evaluated the effect of dexmedetomidine on neurologic and histopathologic outcome from incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat. Anesthesia was maintained with a 25-micrograms.kg-1.h-1 fentanyl infusion combined with 70% nitrous oxide. Incomplete ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation combined with hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mmHg for 30 min. Arterial blood gas tensions, pH, and head temperature were maintained at normal levels during the experiment. Four ischemic groups were tested: group 1 (n = 15) received an intraperitoneal (ip) saline injection (control); group 2 (n = 10) received an ip injection of 10 micrograms/kg dexmedetomidine 30 min before ischemia; group 3 (n = 10) received 100 micrograms/kg dexmedetomidine; and group 4 (n = 10) received 100 micrograms/kg dexmedetomidine plus 1 mg/kg atipamezole (an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist). Neurologic outcome was evaluated for 3 days using a graded deficit score. Histopathology was evaluated in coronal section in caudate and hippocampal tissue segments. Dexmedetomidine (10 and 100 micrograms/kg) significantly decreased plasma catecholamines and improved neurologic and histopathologic outcome in a dose-dependent manner compared to control rats (P less than 0.05). Atipamezole abolished the decrease in catecholamines and the improvement in outcome seen with dexmedetomidine, confirming that these effects were mediated by alpha 2-adrenergic receptors. It is concluded that alpha 2-adrenoreceptor stimulation decreases sympathetic activity and decreases ischemic injury in a model of incomplete cerebral ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial tonometry is a technique used to measure arterial blood pressure noninvasively. The authors developed a new tonometer system containing an array of 15 piezoresistive pressure transducers, a mechanical positioning system, signal conditioning and multiplexing electronics, and a display and control console. The authors evaluated the accuracy, reliability, and clinical acceptability of this system by comparing tonometric blood pressure measurements with intraarterial blood pressure measurements in 60 anesthetized patients. Blood pressure was measured intraarterially in either the right or left radial artery by a Gould P23XL calibrated transducer, whereas blood pressure was measured by tonometer at the radial artery of the other arm. The tonometric waveform was similar to the intraarterial waveform. Simultaneous tonometer and intraarterial systolic blood pressures of the 60 patients (3,036 data sets) had an overall regression coefficient, r = 0.97, and an equation, regression equation = 0.95X + 5.8. Similar values were obtained for mean and diastolic pressures. Regression analyses of the paired tonometric and intraarterial blood pressure values showed good correlations in both sexes and in ages ranging from 8 to 82 yr (r = 0.94-0.97). Mean absolute values of error (precision) for the systolic, mean, and diastolic measurements did not differ significantly among the five systolic, five mean, and four diastolic pressure groups and ranged from 3.6 to 6.6 mmHg, with negligible bias, with intraarterial pressure used as the reference. Bias for the various pressure groups was small: -0.9-3.6 mmHg for systolic; -3.0-0.7 mmHg for mean; and -2.1-4.5 mmHg for diastolic. The \"limits of agreement\" (mean difference +/- two standard deviations) were within an acceptable range for clinical anesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fiberscopes were introduced via a Tuohy needle into the subarachnoid and epidural spaces of ten patients with various pain syndromes. Clear visualization of the subarachnoid space was achieved using the fiberscopes. The epidural space could be visualized only during withdrawal of the fiberscope. In five cases, the fiberscope could be advanced up to the level of the cisternae without causing the patient any discomfort. A slight headache and transient fever were noted after the examination in five and two cases, respectively, but no other complications occurred. Interestingly, preexisting pain diminished (two cases) or disappeared (one case) after the myeloscopy in three of five cases in which the myeloscopy revealed aseptic adhesive arachnoiditis. Further studies should be carried out to evaluate the usefulness of this technique.\r"

  ".W": "Developing a custom computer program to simulate the uptake, distribution, and elimination of inhalational anesthetics allows the anesthesiologist to address specific problems, but extensive skills are required to translate the involved processes first into a set of mathematical equations and then into a satisfactory computer program. The first step is often facilitated by solutions offered in the literature. The second step demands computer proficiency that is often not available, but this problem can be obviated by means of a special-purpose simulation language (SPSL). We therefore constructed a model for closed-circuit inhalation anesthesia with the aid of the block-structured SPSL TUTSIM. Noticeable differences with previous models are that the linear, 14-compartment basic model does not assume a constant alveolar concentration and mimics circulation times through the use of blood pools. Advanced features of the SPSL were used to develop variants of the basic model to simulate feedback-controlled isoflurane administration, nitrous oxide uptake, and the impact of a nonlinearity by incorporating the effect of enflurane on cardiac output. Two variants were concatenated to form a multiple model showing the concentration and second-gas effects. The model was capable of reproducing the anesthetic uptake from previous experimental studies for nitrous oxide. After its validation for other anesthetic agents, the model can be used for clinical, teaching, and research purposes. The SPSL freed the authors from the problems associated with computer programming and allowed them to concentrate on the structure of the model.\r"

Levels of rye I IgG and total IgE were lower in the sera of children born to mothers who received immunotherapy (not statistically significant) than their control cohorts. Paired cord blood and maternal blood samples drawn at delivery showed similar levels of rye I IgG, indicating that blocking antibody freely crosses the placenta.

In a 2-part study, we assessed the prevalence and described the characteristics of CIR and evaluated the efficacy of an anticholinergic nasal spray in its treatment. In Part 1, 90 general medical patients at a ski resort clinic were asked to describe their symptoms associated with cold exposure. Ninety-six percent reported some degree of CIR; 48% reported moderate to severe CIR. Fifty percent had some degree of nasal congestion and 33% reported sneezing. Allergic and nonallergic patients described similar degrees of rhinorrhea. In Part 2, 14 ski patrollers were given atropine sulfate in saline (AS/S) nasal spray before cold exposure in double-blinded placebo (P) controlled crossover fashion. Ninety-two percent noted improvement of CIR with AS/S and 8% experienced no change. None of the subjects noted worsening of symptoms, however, one subject reported excessive dryness at the AS/S concentration used. All 14 subjects receiving P experienced no change in CIR. We conclude that CIR is a distinct clinical syndrome frequently seen with cold temperature exposure, presenting primarily as rhinorrhea and sometimes involving nasal congestion and sneezing. Pretreatment with a 0.005% solution AS/S can effectively block CIR with only minimal short-term side effects.\r"

Frequencies of captured pollen grains of Parthenium hysterophorus, Ambrosia and allied genera, Helianthus, and other Asteracea were examined. Asteraceous aerospora in 1988 accounted for 22.1% of all pollen found, of which 83.4% were pollen of Ambrosia, 12.4% of Parthenium, and the remainder (4.1%) representative of other genera. Capture of native Ambrosia species and P. hysterophorus peaked in September and October in 1987 and 1988, but Parthenium pollen was also found year round with a smaller secondary peak during May, 1988 and 1989. In the winter a different Ambrosia pollen was captured which compared with A. hispida found in the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida at a time when no ragweed was flowering in the vicinity of Corpus Christi. Such a pollen capture probably represents long distance dispersal (ca. 600 miles, 965 km) on strong easterly to southerly prevailing winds. Pollen capture occurred most frequently during daylight hours when percent relative humidity was lower and near midnight when inversions occur. Comparison of pollen capture with meteorologic data demonstrated that photoperiodic responses probably account for the initiation and termination of Ambrosia flowering, and to some extent that of Parthenium, and not sharply lowered temperatures or frost for ending pollen release. Previous plant surveys have shown that P. hysterophorus is more common in the Corpus Christi area than species of Ambrosia, or any other Asteraceae, even though ragweed pollen capture proved 6.9 times greater. This disparity is most likely due to limited long distance dispersal of Parthenium pollen, less pollen produced per another, and a less developed mechanism of wind pollination (passive dispersal or amphiphilous). Since both Parthenium and Ambrosia are significant allergenic plants, correlations between airborne pollen of Parthenium and allergic potential suggest that a prolonged pollination season and perhaps increased allergenicity of unique Parthenium pollen proteins allow Parthenium to be a major allergen despite significantly less ambient pollen.\r"

The most significant weeds releasing airborne pollen, besides the Asteraceae, were the Amaranthaceae and Chenopodiaceae at 14.8% of total pollen captured, which peaked in September and October. Greater pollen capture (74%) occurred from a peak at 11 PM at a time when inversions are frequent to 9 AM than during the period from late morning to 9 PM. Frequency of amaranth-chenopod pollen capture in the western Gulf Coast region showed no relationship with frequencies along the northern and eastern Gulf Coast nor in eastern North America generally, but rather with western North America where these grains have also been sampled at high levels. As in the West, therefore, amaranth-chenopod aeropollen is sufficiently frequent to be a major source of allergens in the western Gulf Coast region. Other weedy plants, Cannabis/Humulus, Rumex, and the Urticaceae (Parieteria/Urtica) each account for only about 1% of the total annual pollen shed, and consequently they are not nearly as potentially relevant here in pollinosis as are the amaranth-chenopods and Asteraceae. Plantago pollen is very infrequently sampled (less than 0.1%) even though several species are common in the area. Acalypha is newly reported as releasing airborne pollen, a genus related to Mercurialis known to release allergenic pollen in Europe.\r"

  ".W": "Ocular allergy is commonly encountered by the allergist, general physician, and ophthalmologist. Diagnosis can usually be made by history, especially a history of itching and an allergic background. The diagnosis can be confirmed by skin testing, in vitro testing, and conjunctival scrapings to look for eosinophils. Once the diagnosis is made, a decision can be reached as to whether treatment is necessary. Often, supportive treatment, or removal of the allergen is preferred. When pharmacologic treatment is necessary, it is advisable to choose a benign form of therapy such as topical vasoconstrictor-antihistamine eyedrops or cromolyn sodium. Topical steroids are rarely necessary and should be used with great caution since they can induce serious sight threatening complications. If topical steroids are required, the patient should be monitored by an ophthalmologist.\r"

On both occasions, the allergic twins showed significantly higher reactivity than their nonallergic siblings. The results indicate that moderate allergic rhinitis is associated with increased bronchial reactivity. This increased reactivity is an acquired trait; however, bronchial reactivity is not constantly increased in pollen rhinitis and may be normal even during the pollen season. The symptoms of allergic rhinitis usually started in childhood before the separation of the siblings. We could not demonstrate any major differences in exposure to allergens or airway irritants between the siblings. The allergic twins tended to have lower birth weight and insufficient weight increase just after birth.\r"

Although more than 50 protein bands could be identified in the crude mite extracts by SDS-PAGE, only eight of them elicited both IgE and IgG4 antibodies in most patients. The molecular weights were 110, 60, 55, 43, 33, 27, 16, and 14 kD, respectively. No antibodies against new antigens were induced after immunotherapy. There was a significant correlation between the intensity of reactive bands of Western blotting and RAST. IgG4 antibody was increased in 72% (13/18) of patients, but the simultaneous change in IgE varied. Analysis of allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies by Western blotting may provide a useful tool for evaluation of clinical response to immunotherapy.\r"

From 1976 to 1980, 52 patients were treated with 50 mg of oral prednisone 13, 7, and 1 hour before and 50 mg intramuscular diphenhydramine 1 hour before procedures (group I). From 1980 to 1984, 48 patients received 300 mg oral cimetidine one hour before procedure in addition to the other regimen (group II). From 1984 to 1989, 49 patients received the three drugs and 25 mg oral ephedrine one hour before procedures (group III). Previous reactions were similar in each group, consisting of urticaria and/or angioedema in all patients, hypotension in some (groups I, 5; II, 6; III, 4), and wheezing in two (group I). Readministration of RCM was intraarterial (groups I, 18; II, 20; III, 20) or intravenous. Generalized reactions upon readministration of RCM occurred in 4 (8%) of group I and 3 (6%) of both groups II and III. All reactions consisted of urticaria and/or angioedema, were mild, and required no specific treatment. In a separate group of ten patients whose previous reactions to RCM were life threatening (shock), pretreatment was accompanied by a provocative dosing regimen. Two patients (20%) experienced systemic reactions that resulted in termination of the procedure. All our pretreatment regimens were equally effective; however, we favor a more comprehensive pretreatment protocol (regimen III) based upon our lack of demonstrated adverse effects and a possible therapeutic advantage as reported by other investigators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary infections are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but the reason is uncertain. Because neutrophils are important for lung defense and are found in increased numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with ARDS, we compared the functional activities of neutrophils obtained from lavage fluid and pulmonary artery blood of 28 patients shortly after the onset of ARDS. The lavage fluids contained 81.3 +/- 9.9% neutrophils, of which more than 95% were viable by vital dye exclusion, and the total protein concentrations were increased (98.8 +/- 98.5 mg/dl). The production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by the neutrophils in lavage fluid was significantly impaired compared with simultaneously tested pulmonary artery and normal neutrophils, and the microbicidal activity of the lavage neutrophils for Staphylococcus aureus was significantly impaired. The migration of alveolar neutrophils in response to a variety of stimuli was markedly reduced as compared with both pulmonary artery and normal neutrophils. The alterations in superoxide anion production and chemotaxis could be reproduced by exposure of normal neutrophils to oxidants (glucose:glucose oxidase), but not to other mediators that have been found in ARDS lavage fluids. Although the pulmonary artery neutrophils from the same patients had impaired production of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide, their microbicidal activity and chemotactic responses were normal. These findings indicate that the function of alveolar neutrophils is impaired in the lungs of patients with ARDS. This could contribute to the high incidence of pulmonary infections in these patients.\r"

Sequential measurements were made in nine subjects entered into the study within 48 h of the onset of ARDS, defined by an arterial/alveolar PO2 ratio of less than 0.3 and radiographic evidence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema. Initial urinary LTE4 excretion was significantly elevated (1.250 +/- 0.050 ng/mg creatinine sulphate; n = 7) compared with a non-ARDS postoperative group (0.254 +/- 0.114 ng/mg; n = 5) and normal control subjects (0.035 +/- 0.010 ng/mg; n = 12). LTE4 excretion in the first 24 h was estimated to be 6.9 micrograms, representing a release of 0.1 micrograms/kg/h of peptido leukotrienes into the bloodstream. These values were physiologically important based on a comparison with the increased urinary LTE4 excretion observed after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in allergic asthmatics (baseline LTE4, 0.06 +/- 0.04 ng/mg; postantigen, 0.56 +/- 0.14 ng/mg; 0.17 micrograms LTE4/24 h; n = 8). In subjects with ARDS, this pathologic LTE4 excretion persisted during a subsequent 5-day study period. Leukotriene E4 excretion was associated with persistent abnormalities in gas exchange, pulmonary edema, and lung compliance, suggesting an important role for peptido leukotrienes in the pathophysiology of ARDS.\r"

Of 22 patients with ARDS, 14 had sepsis or serious infection as the major clinical predisposition, and 10 of 20 high-risk patients had sepsis or serious infection. Mean levels of TNF in serum of patients with ARDS and high risk showed a trend toward elevation but were not significantly higher than mean serum levels in normal subjects. Mean levels of TNF in BAL of ARDS patients (242 +/- 126 pg/ml) were significantly higher than in normal subjects (9 +/- 5 pg/ml), p less than 0.05. Antigenic levels of TNF were undetectable in approximately half the patients with ARDS or the high-risk state. Levels of TNF in BAL appeared to be highest in the first day of ARDS. There appeared to be no relationship between levels of TNF in serum or BAL and subsequent mortality. However, serum levels of TNF were significantly higher in septic patients than in nonseptic patients, whereas this difference was not apparent in BAL. These results show that functional and antigenic elevations of TNF are present in BAL and perhaps in serum of patients with ARDS or with the high-risk state.\r"

  ".W": "The modulation of lung natural killer (NK) cell activity by platelet-activating factor (PAF) and the mechanisms underlying this regulation were examined. When rat lung large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were cultured with PAF we observed an elevation of NK cell activity in a concentration-dependent fashion. Peak effect was observed at 10(-9) M PAF. Kinetic studies indicated that this enhancement occurred when effector cells were preincubated with PAF for 18 h as well as for shorter times. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide blocked the PAF-enhanced NK cell activity after preincubation for 18 h. Extracellular Ca2+ was also needed for the action of PAF as suggested by the effects of Ca2+ chelation with ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and inhibition of Ca2+ entry into the cells with verapamil and diltiazem, all of which abrogated the action of PAF. Furthermore, the enhancement of cytotoxicity was blocked by specific PAF receptor antagonists BN 52021, BN 52111, and WEB 2086. The mechanism of activation appeared to involve protein kinase C (PKC) since pretreatment of lung LGL with the PKC inhibitors H-7 or staurosporine abrogated the PAF-induced effect. Inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by AA-861 inhibited partially the PAF-induced augmentation of NK cell activity, suggesting an implication of endogenous leukotrienes (LT) in this system. In parallel, addition of exogenous LTB4 to lung LGL stimulated their NK cell activity but to a lower level comparatively with PAF. Taken together, our studies indicate that PAF can significantly augment lung NK cell activity and that this effect is dependent on PKC, 5-lipoxygenase, and extracellular calcium.\r"

We studied the antibacterial activity and oxidant generation (before and after stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized zymosan) of alveolar macrophages from 16 patients with ALC. Our results were compared with those obtained from 12 healthy control subjects, from 8 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and from 8 alcoholic individuals without cirrhosis. All were nonsmokers, had normal chest X-rays, and did not present evidence of lung infection 3 months before. The total number of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage did not significantly differ between control subjects and patients. The cellular viability of alveolar macrophages (trypan blue exclusion) was greater than 90% in all cases. The antibacterial activity of alveolar macrophages versus Staphylococcus aureus was severely impaired in ALC (-21 +/- 8.2%) whereas it was normal in PBC (52 +/- 4.2%), in alcoholic subjects (44.6 +/- 5.4%), and in control subjects (60 +/- 5.5%).

In the present study urine samples were spiked with a known amount of [14C]DES and refluxed in 6 N HCl. Sephadex G-15 chromatography of the hydrolyzed urine employed to remove contaminants. DES and IDES were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as well as by amino acid analysis. The amount of isotope recovered was used to determine losses during the overall procedure and the isotope dilution to calculate the amounts of endogenous DES and IDES originally present in the urine. Because similar values were obtained by both methods, the more rapid HPLC method was used for all succeeding analyses. In one experiment, the DES amounts in urine collected from hamsters for 3 days after intratracheal treatment with human neutrophil elastase (300 micrograms) or porcine pancreatic elastase (300 micrograms) were 0.212 +/- 0.012 (mean +/- SEM, two measurements on a single pool) and 0.816 +/- 0.005 (two measurements) microgram per hamster per day, respectively.

Prednisone was started at 1.5 mg/kg/day (not to exceed 100 mg/day) for the first 2 wk followed by a biweekly taper to a maintenance dose of 20 mg/day. Azathioprine was administered at a daily dose of 3 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg/day). The patients tolerated the use of azathioprine well with few associated side effects. Changes in lung function at 1 yr, as measured by resting alveolar-arterial oxygen difference P[A-a]O2, FVC, and single breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCOSB), were all somewhat better in the azathioprine/prednisone group compared with the prednisone alone group, although none of these comparisons were statistically significant. Six of 14 (43%) patients randomized to prednisone plus azathioprine died during the 9-yr follow-up period, compared with 10 of 13 (77%) patients randomized to prednisone plus placebo. A Cox model survival analysis shows a nonsignificant but potentially large survival advantage for azathioprine/prednisone (hazard ratio 0.48, with 95% confidence interval increasing from 0.17 to 1.38). When adjusted for age, the survival advantage of azathioprine/prednisone becomes marginally significant (hazard ratio 0.26, with 95% confidence interval increasing from 0.08 to 0.88; p = 0.02 by large sample approximation, p = 0.05 by randomization test). We conclude that combined prednisone and azathioprine is a safe and possibly effective regimen for the treatment of IPF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A causal association between smoking and silicosis would seriously confound the association between silicosis and lung cancer. The current analysis assessed the association between silicosis and smoking using data on deceased white gold miners who underwent postmortem examination between 1976 and 1981. Smoking histories and exposure information were available. A subset analysis in a group of deceased miners for whom more detailed smoking and exposure information was available confirmed the findings of the larger analysis. Both analyses showed a slight inverse relationship between smoking and silicotic collagenization of the parenchyma and a stronger negative relationship between smoking and silicotic collagenization of the pleura, controlling for age and cumulative exposure to silica dust. No association between silicotic collagenization of the hilar glands and smoking was detected. The data should not be construed as advocating that workers exposed to silica dust should smoke. The hazards of cigarette smoking are likely to far outweigh the hazards of silicosis. The data suggest that the lack of smoking histories in studies of the association between silicosis and lung cancer probably does not seriously confound risk estimates. The distribution of silicotic collagenization in the lungs of smokers and nonsmokers is consistent with enhanced mucus interception, more central deposition in the lungs, and proportionally more lymphatic clearance to the hilum (as opposed to the pleura) of silica particles in smokers compared to nonsmokers.\r"

After a follow-up period of about 22 yr, 172 incident cases of lung cancer were identified. The percentage of the predicted FEV1 was inversely related to lung cancer (p value for trend = 0.01) after adjustment for age and cigarette smoking history. The subjects in the lowest quartile of pulmonary function (% predicted FEV1 less than 84.5) had a relative risk of 2.1 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 3.5) for lung cancer compared with subjects in the highest quartile (% predicted FEV1 = 103.5+). For the 84 cases with a squamous or small cell histologic type of lung cancer, the subjects in the lowest quartile had a relative risk of 2.5 (95% Cl = 1.2 to 5.6) compared with subjects in the highest quartile of pulmonary function. For the 84 patients with lung cancer whose tumors were located within 4 cm of the pulmonary hilum, the subjects in the lowest quartile had a relative risk of 4.0 (95% Cl = 1.7 to 9.7).

A total of 56 patients (61%) required mechanical ventilation for a mean period of 10.7 +/- 12.5 days, 29 of them (52%) needing PEEP (9.9 +/- 3.8 cm H2O). A group of 23 (25%) patients had criteria of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A causal microorganism was identified in 48 patients (52%), the two most frequent etiologies being Streptococcus pneumoniae (14, 15%) and Legionella pneumophila (13, 14%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5, 5%) was always associated with bronchiectasis. Mortality due to severe community-acquired pneumonia was 22% (20 patients). According to univariate analysis, mortality was associated with anticipated death within 4 to 5 yr, inadequate antibiotic treatment before RICU admission, mechanical ventilation requirements, use of PEEP, FIO2 greater than 0.6, coexistence of ARDS, radiographic spread of the pneumonia during RICU admission, septic shock, bacteremia, and P. aeruginosa as the cause of the pneumonia. Further, recursive partitioning analysis selected two factors significantly related to the prognosis: the radiographic spread of the pneumonia during RICU admission and the presence of septic shock.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The eight patients who died due to pneumocystosis and the 12 who failed initial antipneumocystis therapy had significantly higher admission mean APACHE II scores and serum LDH levels and lower mean serum albumin levels than did the 65 who survived and the 61 who responded to initial therapy (p less than 0.05 for each). Differences in mean alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients were not statistically significant with respect to survival or response to initial therapy. In a stepwise discriminant analysis of parameters associated with mortality, APACHE II score and LDH level were statistically significant (p less than 0.0001 for each). In a stepwise discriminant analysis of parameters associated with response to initial therapy, APACHE II score and LDH level were again statistically significant (p less than 0.0001, respectively). The addition of the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and serum albumin level did not further increase the predictive ability of the discriminant analyses. When analyzed alone, neither the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient nor the serum albumin were statistically significant in each discriminant analysis. The APACHE II score combined with the serum LDH may be more useful than other parameters, singly or combined, to more closely match patients with regard to severity of illness due to first episode Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia when comparing experimental new therapies with standard agents.\r"

A 3-day course of vaccine or placebo was given monthly for 3 consecutive months. Participants were monitored weekly over 12 months for acute exacerbations; early morning sputum specimens were collected monthly and during acute exacerbations. Density of colonization by H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae was determined by standard quantitative and semiquantitative techniques, and the latter method (quadrant score) was used to determine the density of growth of pneumococci. A total of 30 patients received vaccine and 32 placebo. The incidence rate of acute bronchitis in the vaccine group (0.011 episodes/person-weeks) was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (0.021 episodes/person-weeks), but there was no difference between the two groups in the incidence rates of more severe disease. Vaccine efficacy was maximal at times of peak incidence of disease. There was no evidence of a decline in vaccine efficacy for acute bronchitis over the 12-month follow-up period. The number of viable H. influenzae in the sputum declined in both vaccine and placebo groups over the 12-month follow-up period. The average concentration of H. influenzae in the vaccine group fell below that in the placebo group within 1 to 2 months after first immunization and remained so for 12 months, although the difference between the two groups narrowed during the follow-up period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Bronchial secretions are difficult to obtain, and little is known about lower airway flora in these patients. We collected simultaneous bronchial and oropharyngeal specimens in 43 CF patients in optimal respiratory status, including both expectorating (17) and nonexpectorating (26) patients, to determine the predictive value of oropharyngeal cultures for identifying lower airway pathogens. An additional goal was to characterize the lower respiratory flora of these patients. Predictive values were defined as the proportion of oropharyngeal culture results that accurately reflected the results of bronchial cultures. Predictive values of positive oropharyngeal cultures in nonexpectorating patients were 83% (95% confidence interval 36 to 100%) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 91% (59 to 100%) for Staphylococcus aureus. Predictive values of negative oropharyngeal cultures were lower: 70% (48 to 86%) for R aeruginosa and 80% (52 to 96%) for S. aureus. A relatively high proportion of nonexpectorating CF patients less than 10 yr old had R aerusginosa (11 of 24, 46%) or Klebsiella species (5 of 24, 21%) in their lower airways. The isolation of Klebsiella was associated with younger age (p = 0.03) and recent administration of antistaphylococcal antibiotics (p = 0.05). Our results suggest that oropharyngeal cultures yielding R aeruginosa or S. aureus are highly predictive, but such cultures lacking these organisms do not rule out the presence of these pathogens in the lower airways of CF patients.\r"

Bronchial responsiveness was measured using the rapid inhalation method. A total of 393 children had satisfactory bronchial challenge data for all 4 days. The measurements derived from the dose-response curve were the PD20 FEV1, which was measured as the provoking dose causing a 20% fall in FEV1, and the dose-response slope (DRS), which was measured as the percentage fall in FEV1 at final dose/total dose administered. Children who had a PD20 FEV1 were categorized as having bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR). The percentage of children with BHR each day was between 7 and 11. One-third of the children with BHR reacted only to histamine or methacholine. The within-subject range for histamine PD20 FEV1 values compared with methacholine suggested that histamine and methacholine are not directly comparable bronchial challenge agents. The dose-response slope values, which could be obtained for all children, had slightly better repeatability than PD20 FEV1 values. Because DRS values obtain data for the entire sample, have good repeatability, and are equally repeatable in children with normal responsiveness or bronchial hyperresponsiveness, they should prove more useful than PD20 FEV1 values for measuring bronchial responsiveness in populations.\r"

The auxiliary device contains an air chamber of 350 ml and two low-resistant valves separating the inspiratory from the expiratory line. After baseline lung function measurements by infant whole-body plethysmography, the patients were randomly assigned to inhale either three times two puffs albuterol (100 micrograms/puff) or three times two puffs placebo at 5-min intervals. Changes in the degree of pulmonary hyperinflation, estimated by thoracic gas volume (TGV) and/or in the degree of bronchial obstruction, estimated by thoracic gas volume (TGV) and/or in the degree of bronchial obstruction, estimated by airway conductance (Gaw), were measured at 5-min intervals for up to 30 min. TGV and Gaw were expressed as standard deviation scores (SDS) of values predicted, and patients improving TGV and/or Gaw more than 2 SD were considered responders. In comparison with placebo, a significant percentage improvement in TGV (by the mean 26 to 53%) and a significant percentage improvement in Gaw (by the mean 34 to 51%) could be found in the active treatment groups.

Hypertonic aerosol-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) also occurs in these patients, but it differs from AIB by exhibiting a faster time course. Although AIB and HIB probably increase airway fluid osmolality, only AIB is associated with airway cooling. In light of the similarities between our canine model and human AIB, we examined peripheral airway responses to dry air and hypertonic aerosol challenge. Specifically, we studied the magnitude and time course of these responses in an in situ, isolated, perfused lobe in which airway temperature was independently controlled. At body temperature, HIB peaked immediately after challenge, whereas transient airway cooling during aerosol challenge delayed HIB. In contrast, airway cooling attenuated AIB but did not alter its time course. Hypocapnia- and histamine-induced responses were not affected by airway cooling, suggesting that smooth muscle function was not impaired. To the extent that the mechanisms producing AIB in dogs and in humans are similar, our results suggest that (1) changes in airway fluid osmolality initiate AIB, (2) AIB = HIB + Cooling, and (3) exercise-induced asthma results from an imbalance between an excitatory pathway stimulated by airway drying and an inhibitory pathway initiated by airway cooling.\r"

Experiments with natural and synthetic tachykinin agonists indicated the presence of both NK-1 and NK-2 receptors at this level. Experiments with the putative NK-1 (L668, 169) or NK-2 (MEN 10,207, MEN 10,376, L659,877, and R396) selective antagonists against NK-1 and NK-2 selective agonists further supported this conclusion. All the tachykinin antagonists tested reduced the noncholinergic bronchoconstriction to field stimulation with the order of potency MEN 10,207 = MEN 10,376 greater than L659,877 greater than L668,169 congruent to R396. In the presence of peptidase inhibitors, the activity of MEN 10,376 toward the noncholinergic bronchoconstriction was slightly reduced, whereas that of L668,169 was increased. These findings demonstrate that both NK-1 and NK-2 receptors mediate the noncholinergic constriction produced by endogenous tachykinins in guinea-pig bronchi and that the relative contribution of NK-2 receptors is greater than that of NK-1. These findings implicate a major role for neurokinin A rather than for substance P as an endogenous bronchoconstrictor in the guinea-pig isolated bronchi. In the presence of peptidase inhibitors, the relative contribution of NK-1 receptors is increased.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the role of epithelial modulation of contraction caused by endothelin-1 in airway smooth muscle in guinea pigs in situ. Airway responses were assessed isometrically as tracheal force and simultaneously as change in lung resistance. Intravenous administration of 10(-8) mol/kg endothelin-1 caused a biphasic response in tracheal active tension: initial relaxation (-0.82 +/- 0.22 g/cm after 30 s, p less than 0.05 versus baseline) followed by contraction (1.65 +/- 0.28 g/cm after 7 min, p less than 0.05 versus baseline). Endothelin-1 also elicited immediate bronchoconstriction; lung resistance increased from 0.148 +/- 0.030 to 0.992 +/- 0.274 cm H2O/L/s (p less than 0.005) after 10(-8) mol/kg endothelin-1 given intravenously. Active tension elicited by 10(-8) mol/kg endothelin-1 after removal of the epithelium from the tracheal segment (0.59 +/- 0.16 g/cm) was less than in segments with an intact epithelium (1.65 +/- 0.28 g/cm, p less than 0.01). Both tracheal contraction and bronchoconstriction were attenuated by pretreatment with indomethacin orally, BW 755C intravenously, or substitution of endothelin-C-terminal hexapeptide for endothelin-1. However, the initial tracheal relaxation response was similar after each intervention. These data suggest actions of endothelin-1 that have not been demonstrated previously: (1) endothelin-1 elicits a biphasic response in tracheal smooth muscle (an initial relaxation response elicited by the carboxy-terminal residues and a later contractile response that requires synthesis of a cyclooxygenase mediator) and (2) epithelium adjacent to the airway smooth muscle modulates contraction elicited by endothelin-1.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether a link exists between the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways and the development of the late-phase asthmatic reaction, we studied with bronchoalveolar lavage 54 asthmatic patients either at baseline (10 patients) or 4 h (11 patients), 24 h (13 patients), and 72 h (20 patients) after allergen inhalation challenge. Among the patients studied 4 h after allergen challenge, five were known to have a late-phase asthmatic response and showed a significant increase in the number and percentage of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage compared with either patients without late-phase response (p less than 0.05) or unchallenged patients (p less than 0.01). Both the number and the percentage of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage were also increased (p less than 0.05) in patients without a late-phase asthmatic reaction studied 24 h but not in those studied 4 h after allergen challenge. The numbers and the percentages of macrophages, neutrophils, or lymphocytes did not differ significantly among the different groups of patients. Of the patients studied 4 and 24 h after allergen challenge, only those with a late-phase asthmatic response showed an increased airway responsiveness to methacholine 1 h before bronchoalveolar lavage. We conclude that the development of the late-phase asthmatic response to allergen inhalation challenge and the allergen-induced increase in airway responsiveness are associated with an early recruitment of eosinophils in the airways.\r"

  ".W": "The flow and volume dependence of the total resistance of the respiratory system (Rrs) was investigated in six mechanically ventilated patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using a simple, rapid method. Isovolume Rrs-flow (V) relationships obtained at different inflation volumes (range 0.1 to 1 L) fitted (p less than 0.001) the following function: Rrs = a/V + b + cV, where a, b, and c are constants. The term \"a/V\" in this equation represents the hyperbolic decrease in thoracic tissue resistance with increasing flow; the term \"cV\" represents the linear increase in airway resistance with increasing flow. Rrs initially decreased with increasing V because at low flow the weight of the a/V was greater than that of the cV. At higher flow, however, cV became predominant and hence Rrs tended to increase. At an inflation volume of 0.5 L, minimum Rrs occurred at average inflation flow of 1.28 L/s. At low flow, Rrs increased progressively with increasing inflation volume; at inflation V greater than 1 L/s, the highest values of Rrs were obtained at low inflation volumes. The flow and volume dependence of Rrs implies that, for comparative purposes, measurements of Rrs should be standardized to a fixed inflation flow and volume.\r"

Respiratory muscle strength improved in all patients, but there was no relationship between the increase in strength and sustained improvement in gas exchange. Ventilation and respiratory pattern were unchanged in all patients, but the mean VD/VT fell and VA rose while the VO2 and VCO2 fell. The ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia increased in patients who demonstrated sustained improvement in blood gases. The mechanism underlying the sustained improvement in gas exchange following NPV is not clear but is likely multifactorial.\r"

  ".W": "In mechanically ventilated patients, disconnection from the ventilator and endotracheal suctioning can induce major arterial oxygen desaturation resulting from apnea, changes in inspired oxygen fraction, and decrease in lung volume. The aim of this study was to test the efficacy of a simple method of delivering oxygen and maintaining lung volume during this process. Our study was conducted in two parts. In the first part, constant-flow insufflation of oxygen (CFI) was used in seven patients ventilated for acute respiratory failure (PaO2/FlO2 = 347 +/- 33 mm Hg) as a means of maintaining arterial oxygenation during apnea and disconnection from the ventilator. CFI was administered via a modified endotracheal tube in which small capillaries allowed delivery of a high-velocity jet flow near the tracheal end of the tube during disconnection from the ventilator. In comparison to apnea alone, CFI prevented a fall in arterial oxygen tension (16 +/- 7 mm Hg during CFI versus 117 +/- 27 during apnea, after 90 s of disconnection in the two situations, p less than 0.001), whereas it did not reduce the development of hypercapnia. The efficacy of CFI resulted both from the injection of oxygen into the trachea and from the maintenance of positive alveolar pressure induced by air entrainment (mean 10.4 +/- 1.1 cm H2O), preventing a fall in lung volume usually occurring after disconnection (+338 +/- 88 ml during CFI versus -344 +/- 64 ml during apnea, p less than 0.01). In the second part of the study CFI was used to prevent arterial oxygen desaturation induced by endotracheal suctioning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Arterial blood gases and spirometry measured at baseline and follow-up were compared with mean nocturnal SaO2 and to other REM sleep SaO2 parameters. We postulated that the onset of NOD would be seen most frequently in those patients with marked derangements of lung mechanics and greater longitudinal deterioration in arterial blood gases. Eight of the subjects developed REM-NOD on follow-up polysomnography. The appearance of REM-NOD was not related, or only minimally so, to initial PaO2, PaCO2, or mean nocturnal SaO2. Upon follow-up, however, the onset of NOD was always associated with deterioration of daytime PaO2 and PaCO2, mainly in those patients with the most severe baseline derangement of spirometry (lung mechanics). On the other hand, one group showed equivalent deterioration in daytime PaO2 and a stable PaCO2 but had less severely deranged baseline mechanics and demonstrated a fall in mean nocturnal SaO2 only. The findings in this latter group indicate that the development of NOD is not purely a result of decreasing daytime PaO2. We conclude that the onset of REM-NOD is mainly related to a severe derangement of lung mechanics with deterioration of resting awake gas exchange (progressive hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and worsening airflow).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the effect of different levels of hypercapnia on total pulmonary resistance (RL) in 13 subjects ranging from nonsnorers with low RL to snorers with high RL and dynamic narrowing of the upper airway during inspiration. Added CO2 was adjusted to achieve a steady-state increase in PETCO2 of +2, +4, or +6 mm Hg. RL was measured at peak inspiratory flow (RLpf), at maximal resistance within breath (RLmax), and at 10 equally spaced points within inspiration in several trials. During wakefulness, hypercapnia was associated with decreased RLmax. During steady state +6 mm Hg hypercapnia, RLmax decreased by 30% (p less than 0.01). During NREM sleep, low levels of hypercapnia did not affect RL. However, +6 mm Hg hypercapnia was associated with decreased RLmax in six of eight subjects (p = 0.07), especially in subjects with high RLmax during room air breathing. The effects of hypercapnia on RLpf paralleled its effect on RLmax. We concluded that (1) the decrease in RL during awake hypercapnia suggests an increase in upper airway dimensions and stiffness, (2) the absence of increased RL during low level NREM hypercapnia (despite the increase in inspiratory flows and collapsing pressures) also suggests an increase in upper airway dimensions and stiffness, and (3) upper airway dilating muscles appear to be recruited in a coordinated fashion with inspiratory muscles in normal humans during NREM sleep. The implications of these findings in patients with obstructive sleep apnea are not clear at this point.\r"

Experiments were performed on nine healthy exercise-conditioned ponies in which catheters had been implanted in the phrenic vein previously. Blood-gas variables and lactate and ammonia concentrations were determined on simultaneously obtained arterial and phrenic-venous blood samples at rest and during 30 min of exertion at 15 mph + 7% grade (heart rate, 200 beats/min; approximately 90% of maximum). Arterial O2 tension and saturation were maintained near resting value but CO2 tension decreased markedly with exercise, and because of increased hemoglobin concentration, arterial O2 content rose. Concomitantly, phrenic venous O2 tension, saturation and content decreased markedly (23.6 +/- 1 mm Hg, 24.5 +/- 2%, 5.2 +/- 0.3 ml/dl at 3 min of exertion) and significant fluctuations did not occur as exercise duration progressed to 30 min. Diaphragmatic arteriovenous O2 content difference and O2 extraction rose from 4 +/- 0.3 to 16 +/- 0.5 ml/dl and from 30 +/- 3 to 75 +/- 1% at 3 min of exercise, and significant deviations did not occur as exercise duration progressed. Arterial lactate and ammonia levels increased during exercise, indicating their release from working limb muscles. Phrenic-venous values of lactate and ammonia did not exceed arterial values. Ponies sweated profusely and were unable to keep up with the belt speed in the last 4 to 5 min of exercise. Constancy of phrenic arteriovenous O2 content difference in exercise indicated ability to adjust perfusion in diaphragm so as to adequately meet its O2 needs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We hypothesized that stimulation of receptors in the oral mucosa modulates the sensation of breathlessness. We studied 10 normal naive volunteers in whom breathlessness was induced by having them breathe for 4 min with an inspiratory resistive load (18 cm H2O/L/s) while breathing was stimulated by CO2 inhalation (end-tidal PCO2 maintained at 55 mm Hg). Initially, subjects breathed with a tight-fitting face mask and inspiratory flow was displayed on a storage oscilloscope. In subsequent trials, the subjects were asked to match this trace, which controlled ventilation and the pattern of breathing. Subjects performed eight trials, four with the tight-fitting mask only (M) and four with a mouthpiece and the mask (MM). M and MM were alternated; the initial condition was chosen at random. Following each of the trials, subjects rated the intensity of their breathlessness by choosing a number from a modified Borg scale. On the average, subjects were more breathless while breathing with the mask and mouthpiece than with the mask alone (mean ratings of breathlessness 6.6 +/- 1.1 and 5.6 +/- 1.8 units, p less than 0.01). Six subjects repeated the protocol on 2 additional days: 1 day with inhalation of warm (34 degrees C), humidified air and 1 day after topical application of 4% lidocaine to the oral mucosa. Both these interventions abolished the differences in breathlessness between mask and mouthpiece and mask alone. We conclude that afferent information from oral mucosal stimulation influences the intensity of breathlessness.\r"

We studied 28 Brown Norway rats that were actively sensitized to ovalbumin (OA). Responsiveness to aerosolized MCh was quantitated as the concentration of MCh required to double pulmonary resistance (EC200 RL). The EC200 RL was determined before and 1 and 5 days after three inhalational challenges with OA (n = 17) or saline (n = 11) at 5-day intervals (on Days 14, 19, and 24 after sensitization). Responsiveness to MCh increased after OA; EC200 RL fell from 1.71 to 0.71 mg/ml at 1 day (p less than 0.01) and 0.87 mg/ml at 5 days (p less than 0.02) after OA but did not change after saline challenge. Formalin-fixed lungs from a sample of OA-challenged (n = 12) and saline-challenged (n = 6) animals were paraffin embedded, and 5-microns sections were stained with hematoxylin-phloxin-saffron. Cross-sectional areas of the airway wall and smooth muscle (ASM) were determined for all intrapulmonary membranous airways. There was an approximately twofold increase in the quantity of airway smooth muscle in airways of OA-challenged animals compared with saline-challenged control animals. Airway wall area did not change significantly. There was a correlation (r = 0.618, p less than 0.05) between the quantity of ASM in large airways (basement membrane length 2.00 to 2.99 mm) and change in responsiveness to MCh.\r"

Some of this variability may be accounted for by differences in the site of upper airway narrowing. To determine whether preoperative awake upper airway and soft tissue volumes predict the response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty, preoperative awake computed tomograms (CT) of the upper airway were performed on 60 consecutive patients with symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea. Tracings were made from the CT scans of upper airway, tongue, and soft palate. Computer software was used to determine the cross-sectional area and volume of the upper airway, tongue, and soft palate. Patients underwent overnight polysomnograms before and 3 months after uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Tongue volume was larger (p less than 0.02) and both upper airway to tongue volume (p less than 0.0005) and oropharynx to soft palate volume ratios (p less than 0.01) were smaller in obese patients. A good response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty as defined by a postoperative apnea index of less than 5 apneas/h or a reduction in apnea index greater than or equal to 50% was seen in 50 patients (83%). Patients who had a good response had a smaller oropharyngeal cross-sectional area (p less than 0.01), a smaller upper airway volume (p less than 0.05), a smaller upper airway to tongue volume ratio (p less than 0.01), and a smaller oropharynx to soft palate volume ratio (p less than 0.05). Obese patients with obstructive sleep apnea have larger tongues and smaller upper airways relative to tongue and soft palate size. Patients with smaller upper airways, particularly relative to tongue and soft palate size, have a good response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the early clinical course of 65 patients with perimesencephalic (nonaneurysmal) subarachnoid hemorrhage. None of the patients rebled; none had delayed cerebral ischemia; and only 3 patients (5%) developed clinical signs of acute hydrocephalus, 2 requiring ventricular shunting. Hyponatremia and electrocardiographic changes were found in the same proportions as in patients with aneurysmal rupture. All patients had a good outcome after 3 months. To control for the influence of the relatively small amount of cisternal blood in perimesencephalic hemorrhage on the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia, we compared these 65 patients with 49 patients who had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This control group with aneurysms was selected according to a similar amount of cisternal blood, a comparable level of consciousness on admission, and absence of other factors known to increase the risk for delayed cerebral ischemia. We found that 4 of the 49 patients with aneurysmal hemorrhage developed delayed cerebral ischemia (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03); therefore the relatively small amount of blood does not account for the absence of delayed cerebral ischemia in perimesencephalic hemorrhage. Patients with a perimesencephalic pattern of hemorrhage and a normal angiogram should be considered to have a distinct subset of subarachnoid hemorrhage and should be excluded from future treatment trials of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "The gene for autosomal dominant \"benign\" familial neonatal convulsions, a transient, primary epilepsy of infancy, has recently been assigned to chromosome 20q. To determine whether this disorder is genetically heterogeneous, we performed linkage analysis in two previously unreported pedigrees with benign familial neonatal convulsions in which clinical heterogeneity was evident. There were 14 affected persons in the first family, and none had seizures (febrile or afebrile) after the age of 2 months. The second family had 13 affected individuals and 2 obligate carriers; seizures frequently did not remit until 6 to 24 months, febrile convulsions occurred in at least 2 patients, apparent audiogenic seizures occurred in 4 patients, and 1 individual had refractory epilepsy until late adolescence. Linkage studies with the chromosome 20 markers D20S19 and D20S20 were performed in both families. The resulting data favored linkage of the disease and marker loci in Family 2 by a maximum odds ratio of 45:1 at 6% recombination. In Family 1, however, the odds were greater than 20,000:1 against linkage at 10% recombination or less. We conclude that the syndrome of benign familial neonatal convulsions is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Further study will be necessary to clarify the relationship between phenotype and genotype in this disorder.\r"

  ".W": "We performed an immunoperoxidase study on muscle biopsy specimens from 19 patients with polymyositis who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (21 specimens) and 5 HIV-seronegative patients with polymyositis and compared the findings. A quantitative analysis of T cells and T-cell subsets, B cells, natural killer cells, interleukin-2 receptor-positive cells, and macrophages was performed on serial sections from all the specimens. Localization of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I and -II antigens, alpha and gamma interferon, and HIV antigens (p24, gp120, and gp41) was performed using specific antisera. In specimens from HIV-positive and seronegative patients, the predominant cell population was CD8+ cells and macrophages invading or surrounding healthy muscle fibers that expressed MHC-I antigen on their surface. The endomysial infiltrates in specimens from HIV-positive patients differed from those seen in specimens from the seronegative patients only by a significant reduction of the CD4+ cells (12.6 +/- 3.2% versus 21.1 +/- 4.2%). HIV antigens were seen in occasional interstitial mononuclear cells (but not in muscle fibers) in 6 of the 21 specimens from HIV-positive patients. Interferon was not localized. We conclude that the development of HIV-associated polymyositis does not appear to be related to direct infection of the muscle fibers by HIV but rather is due to a T-cell-mediated and MHC-I-restricted cytotoxic process, perhaps triggered by HIV. Because this immunopathological mechanism is common in both HIV-associated polymyositis and polymyositis alone, it is suggested that viruses may also be responsible in triggering polymyositis.\r"

Using transgenic mice that overexpress the human gene for copper-zinc-superoxide dismutase, we studied the role of superoxide radicals in the blood-brain permeability changes, edema development, and delayed infarction resulting from cold-trauma brain injury. At 2 hours after a 30-second cold injury, cerebral water and Evans blue contents were reduced, respectively, from 80 +/- 0.2% and 132.7 +/- 12.9 micrograms/gm of dry weight for nontransgenic mice to 78.5 +/- 0.3% and 87.1 +/- 9.9 micrograms/gm of dry weight for transgenic mice. Infarction, as measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, was reduced by 52% in transgenic brains. These data indicate that an increased level of superoxide dismutase activity in the brain reduces the development of vasogenic brain edema and infarction. Superoxide radicals play an important role in the pathogenesis of these lesions in cold-traumatized brain.\r"

Now, we have studied by immunocytochemistry the tissue distribution of the glucose transporter in a variety of primary and metastatic human brain tumors with a monoclonal antibody to the glucose transporter of human erythrocytes. Microvessels in normal brain tissue distant from the tumor, and in brain surrounding the tumor, immunostained strongly for the glucose transporter. Microvessels in primary and metastatic tumors, however, lacked glucose transporter immunoreactivity. Only in the relatively benign juvenile cerebellar astrocytomas was glucose transporter immunoreactivity retained in some of the tumor microvessels. Because a high glucose transporter density is a marker of vessels with barrier properties, our results indicate that the vast majority of brain tumor microvessels do nc, have an intact blood-brain barrier.\r"

  ".W": "Four hundred five children from the Helsinki area who were 1 month to 16 years old were treated for acute encephalitis at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, from January 1968 through December 1987. Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child-years. The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child-years at the age of 15 years. Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella-zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses. In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of \"others,\" whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as varicella-zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one-half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one-fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4- to 9-year age group. The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls. The overall male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero- and respiratory viruses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

All cell lines uniformly expressed T-cell antigens, but not natural killer cell or B-cell antigens. The proportion of helper (CD4+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells in the expanded lines was variable and showed no correlation with the diagnosis. Sixteen cell lines (6 polymyositis, 4 inclusion body myositis, 5 dermatomyositis, 1 other muscle disease) consisted predominantly of CD8+ T cells. None of these lines displayed natural killer-like cytotoxicity but all were capable of lectin-dependent cytotoxicity. Three of 6 polymyositis, 1 of 4 inclusion body myositis, and 1 of 5 dermatomyositis lines showed low but statistically significant cytotoxicity against autologous myotubes (6 to 27% specific 51Cr release; effector-target ratio, 20:1). The results demonstrate that functionally competent cytotoxic T cells can be expanded from muscle affected by inflammatory myopathies and are consistent with the hypothesis that some cytotoxic T cells recognize an autoantigen on myotubes. Further studies of this experimental system may define the molecular mechanism of T cell-mediated muscle fiber injury and may help to identify the relevant antigens.\r"

We report on the isolation and expansion of T cells specific for the acetylcholine receptor of Torpedo californica or for a recombinant mammalian acetylcholine receptor alpha chain peptide (X4), from the peripheral blood of 11 healthy donors. Two major T-cell epitopes, located between amino acid positions 44-104 and 141-172, were identified using a panel of overlapping mammalian alpha chain fusion proteins. Most T lines recognized the acetylcholine receptor epitopes in the molecular context of HLA-DR molecules. Unexpectedly, all the T. californica acetylcholine receptor-specific T lines obtained from one DR4 (DRw53), DQw3 donor and two DR4, w8 (DRw53), DQw3 donors were restricted by DRw53 product(s). Using DR gene-transfected L cells as antigen presenters, in 4 lines, a close relationship between the recognized epitope and the restricting DR element was revealed. The membrane phenotype of the T. californica acetylcholine receptor-and X4-specific T lines was predominantly CD4+CD8-, with some CD4+CD8+ components. It did not significantly differ from that of control, tuberculin purified protein derivate-specific T lines raised from the same donors. These findings are in harmony with previous ones demonstrating the presence of potentially autoimmune T-lymphocyte clones within normal immune repertoires.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging scans of sibs of one family demonstrated megalencephaly and other mild abnormalities.

The immunolocalization of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD22, and CD56 markers, the gamma delta T-cell receptor, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I complex and class II antigens, and complement membrane attack complex (MAC) were examined. The distribution and relative proportions of T cells and T-cell subsets, B cells, macrophages, and eosinophils were determined at perivascular, perimysial, endomysial, and fascial sites of accumulation. At all sites, T cells were predominant, CD8+ cells outnumbered CD4+ cells 6- to 20-fold, and between 60 and 80% of T cells were activated. B cells and eosinophils each accounted for less than 3% of inflammatory cells. Very few cells expressed either the gamma delta T-cell receptor or natural killer cell markers. As in dermatomyositis (DM), MHC class I antigen complex expression was increased on many structurally normal muscle fibers, but in contrast to DM, microvascular MAC deposits were not a feature of EMS. The findings implicate a cellular immune response directed against a connective tissue component in EMS.\r"

The excitatory receptors studied included N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), strychnine-insensitive glycine, phencyclidine, and quisqualate. The inhibitory receptors studied were gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and benzodiazepine. Excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptor binding were differentially altered in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy in comparison to 8 age-comparable autopsy control subjects, and changes in receptor binding were regionally selective in four areas. Binding to phencyclidine receptors associated with the NMDA channel was reduced by 35 to 70% in all regions in the hippocampi of the patients. In contrast, binding to the NMDA recognition site and its associated glycine modulatory site was elevated by 20 to 110% in the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 area and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the patients. Binding to these sites was unaffected in area CA4. Binding to the quisqualate-type excitatory amino acid receptor was unchanged in all regions except the stratum lacunosum moleculare CA1, where it was increased by 63%. GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding was reduced by 20 to 60% in CA1 and CA4, but unchanged in dentate gyrus.

Here, we describe the effects of prolactin-suppression on the course of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in female Lewis rats. Initiation of continuous bromocriptine treatment before immunization reduced both the severity and incidence of clinical signs of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-immunized rats experienced a threefold rise in basal prolactin levels on day 4 after immunization and maintained elevated prolactin levels on day 10, before the onset of neurological signs of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Bromocriptine treatment reduced prolactin levels to those of sham-immunized rats. In vivo bromocriptine pretreatment inhibited splenic lymphocyte proliferative responses in vitro to the immunizing antigen and to concanavalin A. Moreover, bromocriptine therapy was protective when initiated 1 week after the initial immunization and was also effective in suppression of late disease. These results indicate that (1) prolactin levels are elevated after immunization and before the onset of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, (2) bromocriptine inhibits both prolactin secretion and the severity of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, and (3) inhibition is also present when treatment is begun after sensitization, suggesting an effect of prolactin on the effector limb of the immune response during experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.\r"

The other 2 patients had enhancing lesions noted in 7 and 9 of 11 months. In contrast, only two clinical exacerbations were observed during the study period. Neither the exacerbations nor other changes in symptoms or signs correlated with occurrence of the enhancing lesions. Enhancement generally persisted for less than 1 month. The opening of the blood-brain barrier as reflected by gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging may represent ongoing disease activity in patients with mild, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who are clinically stable. The frequency of these lesions appears to be sufficient to use as an outcome measure in clinical trials testing clinical efficacy in patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.\r"

Two salient criticisms concern the combination of items representing multidimensional abilities into a single total score, and the indeterminate distances between hierarchical functional assessment scale categories. In this initial study, the factor structure of the Patient Evaluation and Conference System (PECS) was studied to assess the potential for unidimensional measurement. Factor analysis of a multidiagnostic dataset (n = 3,564) yielded eight factors accounting for 60% of the variance among 68 PECS items. The factors indicate that several unidimensional measures may underlie the PECS. These factors are delineated, and further studies of unidimensionality and additivity are recommended.\r"

Nine seated subjects performed a rapid reaching task to a target placed at shoulder height, 45 degrees to the right of midline. Reach time, timing and magnitude of forces produced by the movement, and onset of deltoid muscle activity were analyzed under supported versus unsupported, and near versus far reach conditions. Reach time was proportional to reach distance. For all reach conditions, initial movement of the center of body mass occurred in a direction toward the target, ie, opposite in direction to reactive forces produced by the accelerating arm. Regardless of support, reactive forces were recorded approximately 30 to 50 msec before arm movement, and represented a greater percentage of body weight, for the far reach conditions. Peak acceleration to the right occurred at proportionately the same time into reach regardless of support or reach distance. Peak acceleration occurred earlier in the supported conditions. This paper provides kinetic evidence of postural adjustments before a rapid reaching task performed by seated subjects.\r"

Sway was measured over 20-second periods with eyes open and eyes closed. The results show that both respiration and eye condition affect the sway distance of the center of pressure on body balance. The sway distance in holding breath after inspiration is significantly greater than in holding breath after expiration, and increasing the respiration rate produces a greater postural sway. Also, the grade of visual compensation for body balance is higher in the regular respiration condition than in breath holding. These findings are applicable for ergonomics, sports, and clinical situations.\r"

The experimental group consisted of nine individuals with at least a 9.5mm LLD. Each subject stood barefoot on a force platform with their feet together. Center-of-pressure data were collected at a rate of 10Hz for 12.8 seconds while the subjects stood with their eyes opened and again with their eyes closed. The amplitude of each person's postural sway in the medial-lateral and anterior-posterior directions was calculated from the center-of-pressure data. The results of the study showed that no significant difference existed between the experimental and control groups. There was, however, a significant difference (p less than .05) between the conditions of eyes opened and closed. These results indicate that individuals with an LLD do not have more postural sway than those without an LLD.\r"

Twenty control subjects received conventional gait retraining, and 20 experimental subjects participated in a treadmill gait retraining program. Rehabilitation outcome was determined by temporal-distance gait parameters and mobility level (house-bound, limited, or unlimited). Muscle strength and range of movement of the lower limb were measured. Previously reported predictors of poor outcome (age, prefracture mobility, admission from sites other than own home, availability of caring person, type of ambulatory aid, presence or absence of senile dementia, and number of concomitant medical diseases) were recorded. Subjects were assessed on admission to the gait retraining program and at discharge from hospital. A 3 x 2 chi-square analysis on discharge mobility level showed the mobility level of the treadmill group to be significantly (p less than .05) higher than the mobility level attained by the control group. Analysis of variance showed no significant differences between the two groups at either assessment time. However, a significant increase in within-group variance from admission to discharge (p less than .01) was noted, and this led to the analysis of a subgroup containing six pairs of subjects matched for number of predictors of poor outcome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since women seek treatment for these problems more frequently than men, postural differences may account for the increased incidence of symptoms in women. The purposes of this study were (1) to compare the sagittal head and shoulder posture of asymptomatic men and women and (2) to compare the posture of asymptomatic and symptomatic women to determine differences in sagittal plane posture. Subjects were 20 asymptomatic men and women volunteers and nine consecutive women patients presenting for evaluation and treatment of craniomandibular pain. The subjects were compared using a valid, reliable, computer-assisted slide digitizing system called the Postural Analysis Digitizing System (PADS). Asymptomatic men and women did not differ in the postural characteristics associated with craniomandibular disorders. Sagittal posture does not appear to be a gender-related factor in these disorders. Symptomatic women, however, do display these postural characteristics to a greater extent than asymptomatic women. Evaluation and treatment of postural dysfunction should be included in the management of these patients.\r"

Eleven able-bodied children and four BKA children volunteered to participate in this investigation. Force platform data were collected for two consecutive foot falls during two experimental sessions. Significant external load differences existed between the prosthetic limbs and nonprosthetic limbs of BKA children and between limbs of the BKA and able-bodied children. The prosthetic limb generally displayed a subordinate role when compared to nonprosthetic and normal limbs. The nonprosthetic limbs displayed a dominant role when compared to the other limbs. These external loading characteristics of the prosthetic and nonprosthetic limbs may be a logical consequence of the morphologic and functional differences that exist between the groups. It was concluded that as long as the prosthetic limb functions differently from a normal limb, BKA children may have a difficult time walking the same as able-bodied children. It would appear to be advantageous to determine the most appropriate gait pattern for BKA children, given the influence of such factors as prosthetic design, construction, and alignment, rehabilitation, and joint loading.\r"

Computed tomography (CT) was used as an objective method of measuring the compartmental distribution of edema. Sixteen patients with a mean age of 37 years (range 19 to 64 years) were investigated by clinical measurement of the leg circumference and by CT at the ankle joint and at three equidistant (10cm) levels above it. The unaffected leg served as a control for the evaluation of the amount of edema and density of the tissues. Edema was found primarily in subcutaneous tissue. The IPC treatment decreased relative edema from 23% to 15.9% (p less than 0.01) as measured by CT, and from 23.5% to 13.2% as measured clinically. The density of muscle tissue increased 9% (p less than 0.01) and that of subcutaneous tissue decreased 5.6% (p less than 0.05). The IPC treatment influenced both the amount of edema and the density of tissue compartments.\r"

Deciding when a patient may be experiencing this condition is difficult, however, because of frequent deficits in patient communication skills (eg, aphasia and cognitive deficits) and the multisystem illnesses affecting many rehabilitation patients. We reviewed the charts of 30 rehabilitation patients transferred emergently during the years 1986 to 1988 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which was subsequently documented by ventilation-perfusion scanning. The average age of the 30 patients was 65; 63% were women and 20 (67%) had an admitting diagnosis of stroke. The most common new-onset clinical findings in the 24 hours before discharge were unusual facial skin color changes (pale, flushed, or cyanotic) (57%), chest or upper back pain (47%), tachycardia (heart rate more than 100 bpm) (40%), hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90%) (40%), and fever less than 101F (37%). In 63% of the patients, either anxiety, restlessness, diaphoresis, or dyspnea was also noted in the 24 hours before discharge. The data suggest that careful physician and nursing scrutiny may identify clinical signs characteristic of pulmonary embolism, and that the de novo appearance of these constellations of findings may help to select candidates for ventilation-perfusion scanning.\r"

As expected, group means revealed severely reduced performance which was equally observable across all auditory comprehension tasks. To determine whether individual subjects demonstrated a pattern of consistently reduced performance for auditory comprehension tasks, z-scores and chi-square statistics were also calculated for each subject and task. The individuals with global aphasia demonstrated a greater number of statistically significant z-scores than was expected by chance. This was not true for the subjects with mixed nonfluent aphasia. Results of this research indicate that although as a group individuals with global aphasia may demonstrate consistently reduced auditory comprehension, when considered on an individual basis, this group may comprise a somewhat divergent population with respect to the configuration of preserved and impaired auditory comprehension skills.\r"

Assessment was made using a hand-held dynamometer with head held at the midline and with rotation left and right within a pain-free range.

The hand-to-mouth maneuver was graded according to the degree of completion using a three-level ordinal scale. Spearman (rs) correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between the extent of completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver and both the active elbow-flexion-range deficit (rs = -.853) and the elbow-flexor muscle force (rs = .829). The correlation of the maneuver with elbow-extensor muscle tone (rs = -.063) was not significant, but the relationship may have been influenced by the fact that only a minority of subjects had elevated tone, and that elevation was minimal. The result suggest that both active-movement deficits and muscle strength may be important to upper extremity function.\r"

Rehabilitation participants were compared with a group similar in age, major diagnostic category, and functional ability, who did not receive rehabilitation. Only 21% of persons meeting the study criteria for rehabilitation actually received rehabilitation services. At follow-up, participants in rehabilitation had lower mortality, spent less time in skilled nursing care, and were less frequently hospitalized. Although exploratory in nature, this study supports previously observed benefits of rehabilitation. In combination with clinical assessment, the process of identifying patient subgroups may be useful in planning interventions more uniformly and in developing measures to reduce selection bias in rehabilitation admission decisions.\r"

In addition, potential approaches to rehabilitation management are evaluated, and consideration is given to the management of the asymptomatic HIV carrier. The differences between HIV infection in adults and children are explored, and the social implications of HIV rehabilitation are discussed. After consideration of the basic pathophysiology of infection and the modes of transmission, the significance and ethics of serologic testing are examined, and the concept of universal precautions is described. The paper concludes with a discussion of the use of safe sex practices by the disabled population.\r"

A 78-year-old man with this diagnosis for 18 years entered the hospital after a lumbar laminectomy and complete bedrest for seven weeks. After a three-week course of twice-daily Velcro board, therapeutic putty, and table-side isometric exercises, his hand and wrist manual muscle testing score, hand grasp and pinch strength, and nine-hole peg test times had all improved. In addition, the patient had moved from minimum-moderate assist in dressing and hygiene, and maximum assist in homemaking, to stand-by assist in both areas. The outcome demonstrates the feasibility and functional value of isometric and resistive strengthening exercises in muscles severely affected by a myopathic process.\r"

There are several similarities between multiple sclerosis and hereditary coproporphyria that are probably due to the central nervous system dysfunction present in both. This report describes a 62-year-old man with a five-year history of progressive paraparesis initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis. Supporting evidence for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disease included three oligoclonal bands in the patient's cerebral spinal fluid, a prolonged visual evoked response bilaterally, abnormal sensory evoked potentials, and an area of increased signal in the posterior cervical cord suggestive of demyelination that was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Features atypical for multiple sclerosis were hypoactive deep-tendon reflexes, electromyographic evidence of peripheral neuropathy, and severe constipation. Elevated urine porphyrins and decreased levels of coproporphyrinogen oxidase confirmed the correct diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria. The patient improved after being placed on a high-carbohydrate diet. Although central demyelination is known to occur in patients with porphyria, delayed evoked potentials and MRI abnormalities have not been previously reported.\r"

The duration of cigarette smoking was the most significant independent predictor of the presence of ICAS. Other independently significant predictors of ICAS were hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and current systolic blood pressure. The interaction of diabetes and duration of smoking was a significant negative predictor. In patients for whom serum lipid values were available, lower levels of apolipoprotein A-I were associated with a higher risk of having ICAS. However, the effect of apolipoprotein A-I as a predictor of the presence of ICAS was far outweighted by the effects of duration of smoking and hypertension.\r"

These results revealed a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 89%, and an overall accuracy of 61% for angiography. The ulcers were classified into types A, B, and C to assess the interobserver agreement rate among three readers. This resulted in a 4% interobserver agreement among a total of 75 ulcers. Because of the high interobserver disagreement and the poor correlation between angiographic and pathologic findings in the surgical specimens, we conclude that the diagnosis of carotid artery ulceration by angiography is not reliable.\r"

Patients underwent lumbar puncture and neurologic testing before and after 8 weeks or more of oral zidovudine therapy (600 to 1500 mg/d). After 8 weeks of therapy, the frequency of HIV isolation from CSF cultures was unchanged. Significant neurologic improvement by examination was noted in 61.5% (32/52) of the patients. The median CSF zidovudine concentration among 29 patients was 0.047 mg/L (range, 0.015 to 0.198 mg/L). No correlation between CSF zidovudine concentration, cumulative dose, or HIV isolation from CSF and persistence or resolution of neurologic symptoms or signs was observed. The mechanisms by which zidovudine improves neurologic function are unclear and appear unrelated to direct clearance of virus from CSF.\r"

One hundred sixty-six asymptomatic HIV+ subjects, 63 neurologically symptomatic HIV+ subjects, and six at-risk HIV-1-seronegative (HIV-) control subjects underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on entry into this longitudinal study. Three (1.8%) of the asymptomatic HIV+ subjects had both a reactive CSF VDRL test and a reactive CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-ABS) test. Two of these three subjects had a history of appropriately treated early syphilis, and all had a reactive serum rapid plasma reagin test. Of the 63 neurologically symptomatic HIV+ subjects, one patient with dementia had both a reactive CSF VDRL test and a fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test. Subjective improvement in cognitive skills followed high-dose, intravenous penicillin therapy. Another subject had a penicillin-responsive myelopathy accompanied by a reactive CSF fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test result, but a nonreactive CSF VDRL. Unsuspected neurosyphilis is relatively common in our population of asymptomatic HIV+ subjects and may be responsible for neurological disease in a significant minority of neurologically symptomatic HIV+ persons. Cerebrospinal fluid examination should be performed in all HIV+ persons with a history of syphilis or serological evidence of syphilis, regardless of prior treatment. Additionally, neurosyphilis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neurological disease in any HIV+ person.\r"

Subjects were volunteers for a longitudinal study of the human immunodeficiency virus infection and were not selected because of neuropsychiatric symptoms. Subjects were at all stages of illness, although most were asymptomatic. Faster rates of decline in percent CD4 lymphocyte were related to poorer performance on measures of memory and reaction time. This relationship was independent of stage of illness and CD4 level at the time of neuropsychologic examination, and was not due to medication effects. The rate of percent CD4 lymphocyte cell loss is associated with and may represent a risk factor for the development of the human immunodeficiency virus-related neurobehavioral deficit.\r"

Immunoblots confirmed the presence of soluble material reacting with Alz-50 antibody in the Alzheimer fibroblasts. Ultrastructurally, fascicles of 10-nm filaments were seen that occasionally twisted around each other, but no structures were seen that were identical to paired helical filaments. Thus, cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with Alzheimer's disease developed greater immunocytochemical reactivity with antibodies raised to paired helical filaments than did fibroblasts from control subjects, when cultured under the specified conditions.\r"

Regional variations in the activity of the two MAO forms (A and B) were found in aging, AD, and PD. Age-related increase of MAO-B was found in all four areas of the brain, and MAO-A was increased in the nbM and temporal pole. In AD, MAO-B was decreased in the nbM and increased in the temporal pole, while MAO-A was increased in the hypothalamus and frontal pole. In PD, MAO-B was decreased in the nbM and increased in the hypothalamus, while MAO-A was increased in the hypothalamus and decreased in the nbM and temporal pole. These data indicate that with regard to MAO activity, AD and PD are dissimilar diseases and neither strictly follows age-related changes.\r"

  ".U": "91315322\r", 
  ".W": "The incidence of myasthenia gravis (MG) was found to be constant in calendar time. The mean annual incidence rate was 4.4 per million population. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates disclosed a bimodal appearance for both sexes, with a peak age at onset located in the early-onset group and another peak for late onset of MG. Early onset of MG appeared 10 years later for male individuals than for female individuals, whereas the peak for late onset of MG was located at the same age for both sexes. It is suggested that the separation between early onset and late onset of MG should be at the age of 50 years for both sexes, rather than at 35 to 40 years as accepted in most studies. The prevalence of MG has increased in time. On January 1, 1988, the point prevalence rate was 77 per million population (female subjects, 96, and male subjects, 57). This reflects an improvement in prognosis despite the fact that life expectancy was found to be significantly lower for MG patients than that of the sex- and age-matched population. The factors causing increased mortality were found to be operative throughout the duration of the disease. Maximum severity of disease was reached within 2 years from onset in 78% of the cases, and more than 50% of all MG-related deaths occurred during the same period. In the course of MG, 70% of all patients experience generalized muscular weakness, and 30% to 40% also suffer from respiratory problems.\r"

The majority of these cases are characterized by raised intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly. They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of chronic meningitis in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either papilledema or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8). The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold. First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC. Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC. It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications.\r"

An essential principle of cognitive neuropsychology is that disorders of higher cortical functions can be understood in terms of breakdowns of one or more information-processing modules. Each module is the most basic element of intelligence that can be defined based on current knowledge. This approach is a refinement of-not a fundamental departure from-the 19th-century \"localizationist\" view of language disorders. Wernicke's aphasia, for example, classical attributed to a single cognitive deficit (loss of word sounds), is shown in this review to require damage to multiple distinct information-processing modules. Cognitive neuropsychology provides the tools for the type of fine-grained analyses of behavior that are needed to capitalize on recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, including the development of more sophisticated models of brain-behavior relationships.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulates proteoglycan degradation and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release and inhibits proteoglycan synthesis by cartilage in organ culture. Addition of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator, mezerein, resulted in the concentration-dependent inhibition of IL-1 activity on proteoglycan metabolism. Similar effects were seen with other compounds which stimulated PKC, such as teleocidin B4 and phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu), but not with a phorbol analog that is inactive in stimulating PKC. Simultaneous addition of the PKC antagonist, staurosporine, blocked the mezerein-induced inhibition of IL-1 activity on both proteoglycan degradation and synthesis in a concentration-related manner. In contrast to its inhibition of the effect of IL-1 on proteoglycan metabolism, mezerein did not block the release of PGE2 by cartilage in response to IL-1 but caused a synergistic stimulation of PGE2 release. Importantly, in cultures made deficient in PKC by prolonged incubation with PDBu, the effects of this PKC agonist on proteoglycan breakdown and PGE2 were blocked, while stimulation by IL-1 persisted. These data indicate that the effects of IL-1 on proteoglycan metabolism and prostaglandin production are mediated by an intracellular signal distinct from PKC and suggest that activation of PKC in chondrocytes may play a role in modulating the action of IL-1 on proteoglycan metabolism.\r"

The activity of 5NT was compared with activities of nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, alkaline and neutral phosphatases, and adenosine deaminase, in the same samples. Higher levels of 5NT activity occurred in synovial fluid from osteoarthritic joints than from joints of patients with gout, pseudogout, or rheumatoid arthritis. The highest levels of 5NT activity were found in synovial fluid from patients with Milwaukee shoulder syndrome and from osteoarthritis patients in whom deposition of calcium-containing crystals was also present.\r"

  ".W": "Synovial fluid basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals are associated with severe destructive arthropathies that are characterized by synovial proliferation and digestion of articular collagenous structures. BCP crystals are potent mitogens, which may account for this proliferation. The role of collagenase in articular degradation is controversial because, despite the massive loss of collagen, no studies have confirmed collagenolytic activity in synovial fluid, as originally reported. We investigated collagenase messenger RNA induction and enzyme activity in human foreskin fibroblasts proliferating in response to stimulation with BCP crystals, and analyzed the associated secreted proteins. Northern blots revealed a dose-dependent accumulation of collagenase message, evident by 4 hours and continuing to at least 36 hours, in BCP-stimulated cultures. One- and 2-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of conditioned media from BCP crystal-stimulated cultures revealed the selective induction of 2 proteins with molecular weight and pI values consistent with those of collagenase. Increased enzyme activity was also found. Thus, the mitogenic response of fibroblasts to BCP crystals is accompanied by collagenase induction and secretion, supporting the hypothesis that they act as a mediator of joint destruction in BCP crystal-associated arthropathies.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the binding of highly purified soluble human C-reactive protein (CRP) to human neutrophils. Binding of CRP to neutrophils was rapid (50% of maximal binding occurred within 15 seconds), and complete within 5 minutes. Binding was inhibitable by excess unlabeled CRP, and nonspecific binding in the presence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled CRP was 10% of total binding. Binding was not affected by other proteins, including albumin, fibronectin, rabbit IgG, or normal human plasma. Maximal binding required both calcium (0.5 mM) and magnesium (0.24 mM) ions. Calcium phosphorylcholine (10 micrograms/ml) or sodium citrate (10 micrograms/ml) completely dissociated bound CRP. Binding was saturable and most consistent with a 2-site model, demonstrating both a high-affinity receptor (1.4 x 10(4) sites/cell; Kd 3.7 x 10(-10) M) and a low-affinity receptor (4.2 x 10(5) sites/cell; Kd 2.5 x 10(-8) M). CRP at concentrations of 50 micrograms/ml inhibited the neutrophil superoxide production induced by phorbol ester. At concentrations of 100 micrograms/ml or greater, CRP also inhibited superoxide production in a cell-free xanthine oxidase-acetaldehyde system. These data suggest that CRP can down-regulate neutrophil oxidative capacity through interaction with receptors on neutrophils as well as by direct antioxidant activity.\r"

When administered after CIA had begun, the progression of the arthritis was suppressed significantly by R73 MAb treatment. The preventive and suppressive effects of R73 MAb on CIA were associated with the depletion of peripheral blood alpha/beta-positive T cells.

As part of an ongoing prospective cohort study, 3 disease activity indices, the physician's global assessment, the Lupus Activity Index, and the University of Toronto SLE Disease Activity Index, have been recorded, at least quarterly since 1987, on 185 SLE patients. We developed a definition of SLE flare and a description of its clinical epidemiology. Disease flare was defined as a change of greater than or equal to 1.0 in the physician's global assessment of disease activity (measured on a 0-3 scale) from the previous visit or from a visit within the last 93 days. Of the 185 patients, 98 (53%) had greater than or equal to 1 flare; the total number of flares was 146. The incidence of flare was 0.65 per patient-year of followup. The median time from the first study visit to a flare was 12 months. Flares were frequently characterized by constitutional symptoms, musculoskeletal involvement, cutaneous involvement, and decreasing levels of C3 and C4. At the time of flare, the mean University of Toronto SLE Disease Activity Index score increased by 3.0 and the mean Lupus Activity Index score (modified to omit the physician's global assessment) increased by 0.26. Overall, 44.8% of the flares prompted a change in treatment. Patients who experienced flares fulfilled more of the SLE criteria at entry and had been followed up for a longer duration after entry into the study, compared with those who did not have flares.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients randomized to receive intravenous cyclophosphamide, oral cyclophosphamide, or oral azathioprine plus cyclophosphamide had significantly better preservation of renal function than did patients who were randomized to receive prednisone only. Results in the azathioprine group did not differ from those in the prednisone-only group. Cyclophosphamide appears to have long-term benefit in the delay or prevention of end-stage renal disease in patients with lupus nephritis.\r"

Patients were randomly assigned to receive either AZA (100 mg daily) or oral MTX (7.5 mg weekly). After 8 weeks, the dosage was increased depending on the clinical improvement. Sixty-four patients were followed up for 48 weeks (33 AZA, 31 MTX). Comparison of values at week 24 with baseline values revealed significant improvement in 12 of 13 disease variables in the MTX group and in 6 of 13 in the AZA group. Comparison between the 2 treatment groups at 24 weeks, by area-under-the-curve analysis, showed significantly more improvement in the MTX group in terms of the swollen joint count, pain score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, hemoglobin level, thrombocyte level, and disease activity score. A significant overall clinical improvement (disease activity score) was found in 7 of 20 patients treated with AZA and 18 of 30 patients treated with MTX after 24 weeks of therapy, and in 6 of 12 AZA-treated patients and 19 of 25 MTX-treated patients after 48 weeks. The number of withdrawals due to side effects was significantly higher in the AZA group. After 48 weeks, only 12 patients from the AZA group (36%), but 25 from the MTX group (81%), were still using the initial drug. These results demonstrate MTX to be superior to AZA in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, with a more rapid clinical improvement which is sustained after 1 year, accompanied by a lower rate of serious adverse reactions.\r"

Various chemical and physical stimuli mediate an endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction through the release of endothelial soluble factors, such as the recently recognized endothelium-derived vasoconstrictor peptide called endothelin. The presence of circulating endothelin and the effect of cold exposure on plasma endothelin levels were investigated in patients with scleroderma and in healthy control subjects. Radioimmunoassay demonstrated a mean +/- SD plasma level of 10.7 +/- 7.3 pg/ml in the patients (n = 19) and 3.7 +/- 2 in the control subjects (n = 16) (P less than 0.005). These levels were also assessed in 5 control subjects and 5 scleroderma patients before and after 30 minutes of total body cooling (to 15 degrees C). The endothelin level did not change significantly in either group; however, 2 scleroderma patients showed a significant increase after cooling. The effects of endothelin on fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis were evaluated in order to assess the impact of released endothelin on the interstitium. A significant mitogenic effect and a collagen synthesis-enhancing effect, which were dose-dependent, were seen. The strong, characteristically prolonged, vasoconstrictor activity coupled with the profibrotic effect demonstrated here make it likely that disturbances in the control of endothelin production can contribute to the pathogenesis of scleroderma.\r"

Data from 4 national probability samples were analyzed, in which occupation and income were measured currently and prior to the development of arthritis. These data indicate that previous studies overestimated the strength of the association between schooling and arthritis because income and, especially, occupation were not analyzed as separate covariates. The overestimate appears to be especially high for persons currently employed, for men, and for persons employed in dangerous jobs. Health policy strategies directed toward reducing arthritis rates require not simply a focus on education, but the additional socioeconomic status dimensions of income and occupational safety and health.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that intermittent claudication initiates a systemic inflammatory response was investigated by studying the effect of exercise on markers of neutrophil activation and vascular permeability in 25 claudicants and 10 controls. Urinary albumin excretion, previously demonstrated to reflect vascular permeability, increased significantly after exercise in claudicants and was associated with decreased neutrophil filterability and increased serum lysozyme activity. No similar exercise-induced changes were seen in controls or in claudicants after successful arterial bypass surgery. These results suggest that intermittent claudication is associated with potentially deleterious systemic manifestations that are surgically reversible.\r"

Some problem with the use of the device was encountered in 47 cases (23%), but in only five cases (2.5%) were the problems serious enough to warrant abandonment of its use. A clear airway was ultimately achieved in 191 children. Downfolding of the epiglottis over the laryngeal inlet was identified in eight out of 24 patients where flexible laryngoscopy was performed, clinically all these had unobstructed airways. The mask was used in 16 children with known airway problems. It is concluded that the size 2 laryngeal mask airway can be successfully used within the weight range 6-30 kg.\r"

  ".U": "91061824\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND. A sudden increase in the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder among the patients in our cardiac-transplantation program was temporally related to introduction of the immunosuppressive drug OKT3. This monoclonal antibody has come to be widely used in recent years both to prevent and to treat rejection after cardiac transplantation. METHODS. In order to identify variables that predict the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, we analyzed retrospectively a series of 154 consecutive cardiac-transplant recipients at a single institution. Univariate analyses and multivariate analysis by logistic regression were performed. RESULTS. Among 75 patients who did not receive OKT3, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder developed in 1 (1.3 percent), as compared with 9 of 79 patients who received the drug (11.4 percent); the incidence among the OKT3-treated patients was ninefold higher (odds ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 54.7). According to multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was the use of OKT3 (P = 0.001). A significant increase in risk with increasing doses was also apparent: 4 of 65 patients who received a cumulative dose of 75 mg of OKT3 or less (6.2 percent) had post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, whereas 5 of 14 patients who received more than 75 mg had the disorder (35.7 percent; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION. The addition of OKT3 to the immunosuppressive regimen increases the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder after cardiac transplantation, and the risk increases sharply after cumulative doses greater than 75 mg. We suggest that the risks and benefits of prophylactic OKT3 administration be reassessed in the light of these findings, particularly since the value of prophylactic immunotherapy in cardiac-transplant recipients remains to be clearly established.\r"

After intercourse, the prevalence of E coli bacteriuria increased slightly in oral contraceptive users but dramatically in both foam and condom users and diaphragm-spermicide users. Twenty-four hours later, the prevalence of bacteriuria remained significantly elevated only in the latter two groups. Similarly, vaginal colonization with E coli was more dramatic and persistent in users of diaphragm-spermicide and foam and condoms. Vaginal colonization with Candida species, enterococci, and staphylococci also increased significantly in diaphragm-spermicide users after intercourse. We conclude that use of the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly or use of a spermicidal foam with a condom markedly alters normal vaginal flora and strongly predisposes users to the development of vaginal colonization and bacteriuria with E coli.\r"

The 15 lowest-rated lecturers and the 15 highest-rated lecturers, based on the mean ratings of students from two consecutive years (1982 and 1983) in a large multi-instructor course, served as the target group. Blinded non-student raters observed the lectures in 1984 (two per lecture) and completed quantitative and qualitative forms. For all six subscores from the quantitative form, statistically significant differences between the lecturers given the highest and lowest ratings were obtained. It is concluded that the students' ratings were stable across the three years; the independent observers discriminated between the lecturers the students rated the highest and the lowest; voice presentation characteristics discriminated the most effectively; and nonmedical non-student observers are potentially a useful source of information regarding faculty teaching skills.\r"

Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with monosialoganglioside or placebo according to a double-blind experimental design. The two treatment groups were homogeneous at entry with regard to the main clinical parameters. Both groups improved, but the rate and degree of improvement were greater in the monosialoganglioside-treated group. The difference was significant on days 14 (p = 0.04) and 21 (p = 0.02). Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that monosialoganglioside reduces brain edema and provides nonspecific neuronal membrane protection.\r"

PCP did not develop in any patient on co-trimoxazole. 33 (28%) had side-effects, mainly rash, pruritus, and nausea. 15 discontinued co-trimoxazole, but only 11 (9%), who withdrew in the first month, were clearly drug-intolerant. Thus, low-dose, thrice weekly co-trimoxazole completely prevents AIDS-associated PCP, is cost-effective, and well tolerated by more than 85% of patients. Controlled comparisons of this regimen with other prophylactic agents are warranted.\r"

The patients ranged in age from 14 to 79 years (mean, 51.8 years); 10 were male; 17 were white; and three were black. Ten tumors were colonic (eight, right sided; two, left sided) and 10 were rectal; seven were stage B and 12 were stage C. One patient presented with distant metastases. Eleven of 16 tumors assessed by flow cytometry were diploid. Parenchymal hepatic metastases developed in only two patients. The overall 5-year survival rate was 36%, and matched cases did not vary significantly in survival from typical nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. There was a trend toward poorer survival for patients with advanced-stage tumor. Survival was not affected by primary site, ploidy, presence of vascular/lymphatic invasion or residual adenoma, or percentage of extracellular mucin or signet-ring cells. Our cases were somewhat lower stage than literature cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lintis plastica variant.\r"

However, we were unable to demonstrate any significant absorption of isoflurane by wet SG. Care must be taken, therefore, when using SG as a drying agent in the sampling line of an analyser during research involving volatile anaesthetic agents.\r"

Forty consecutive patients were allocated randomly to two groups. Patients in group I (n = 19) received midazolam 81 (SEM 32) micrograms kg-1; those in group II (n = 21) received propofol 950 (400) micrograms kg-1. Both agents were administered as single injections to similar end-points of sedation. Psychomotor function was assessed using the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). Amnesia was measured with a visual memory test and subjective questionnaire. Patients in group I had a lower DSST score than those in group II (P less than 0.01), indicating a hangover effect from midazolam. Amnesia was similar in the two groups up to the time of removal of the endoscope. More patients in group II remembered removal of the endoscope (P less than 0.001). Oxygen desaturation from baseline was similar in both groups (P less than 0.01). An increase in heart rate and decrease in mean arterial pressure were noted in both groups. Propofol provided more rapid recovery compared with midazolam, but was associated with pain on injection, a short amnesia span, and reduced patient acceptance.\r"

Plasma potassium was monitored continuously and the signal compared with the desired plasma potassium concentration. The resulting error signal controlled the infusion rates of a concentrated potassium chloride solution (50 or 200 mmol litre-1) and a solution of 50% glucose with insulin 200 u litre-1. Plasma potassium was increased or decreased to the desired concentration at various rates, dictated by the controller constants. Increases were achieved significantly faster than reductions. The system may prove useful for elucidating the fate of infused potassium and for determining the optimum rate of insulin infusion in hyperkalaemia. If adapted for clinical use, it may find applications in the management of various abnormalities of potassium homeostasis.\r"

For comparison with normal practice, a fifth group received neostigmine 0.05 mg kg-1 when the first twitch of the train-of-four was 10% of control. Total recovery time from PTC1 10% to a train-of-four ratio of 0.8 was not reduced by early administration of the anticholinesterases, compared with conventional administration of neostigmine at T1 10%. However, recovery from intense block was faster after neostigmine than edrophonium (P less than 0.01). Doubling the doses of the anticholinesterases did not reduce the recovery time and had the effect of increasing variability. We conclude that there is no clinical advantage in attempting to antagonize intense neuromuscular block in children using normal or increased doses of neostigmine or edrophonium.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the safety of induced hypotension produced by extradural anaesthesia in patients with medically controlled hypertension. The haemodynamic response to induced hypotension was assessed in 38 non-hypertensive and 31 controlled hypertensive patients. All received extradural anaesthesia to T4 or above which decreased mean arterial pressure to 52 mm Hg and 55 mm Hg in normotensive and hypertensive patients, respectively. Cardiac output (thermodilution) was maintained by low dose i.v. infusions of adrenaline (1-5 micrograms min-1). No differences in the haemodynamic response to induced hypotension were observed in hypertensive patients. Data were collected also from 987 consecutive patients (353 hypertensive and 634 non-hypertensive) undergoing total hip replacement. Patients with hypertension were significantly older (68 vs 60 yr; P less than 0.001) and had greater ASA ratings (P less than 0.001). The smallest recorded systolic pressures were reduced more in patients with hypertension (57% vs 52%, respectively; P less than 0.001). The mean duration of maintained intraoperative hypotension (100 and 98 min) and estimated intraoperative blood loss (278 vs 281 ml) were similar in each group. After operation, two patients developed myocardial infarctions. None developed acute renal failure or stroke. There were three deaths; one of a patient who had hypertension. This suggests that induced hypotension with extradural anaesthesia is a safe technique for patients with medically controlled hypertension undergoing total hip arthroplasty.\r"

Digital outputs of both pressures were captured directly onto computer hard disk; data recorded during flushing of the arterial line were excluded from analysis. We studied 53 patients undergoing cardiac, major vascular and neurosurgical procedures; 17705 comparisons of systolic, diastolic and mean pressure were analysed. Overall correlations between Finapres and invasive pressures were poor (r = 0.82, 0.68 and 0.78 for systolic, diastolic and mean pressures, respectively). The Finapres exhibited a high level of accuracy and precision in some recordings. However, patient data sets showed marked variability in average pressure differences (invasive minus Finapres) when examined individually or grouped by operation type. Unexplained variations in pressure difference with time and absolute pressure were observed also. Whilst providing useful beat-to-beat information on arterial pressure trends, the Finapres cannot be recommended as a universal substitute for invasive arterial pressure monitoring.\r"

Good agreement was recorded for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate over a range of pressures. However, agreement of mean and diastolic pressures was poor, with the Finapres tending to overestimate these values. In cases requiring profound hypotension, direct arterial pressure monitoring remains the method of choice.\r"

Isobolographic and algebraic (fractional) analyses were used to assess quantitatively the combined hypnotic effect of thiopentone and propofol and to define the type of interaction between these two drugs. The interaction between thiopentone and propofol was found to be synergistic.\r"

During and after anaesthesia, blood samples were taken for measurement of propofol concentrations and it was found that the values obtained were systematically overpredicted by the delivery system algorithm. New pharmacokinetic microconstants were derived from our data which reflected more accurately the elimination and distribution of propofol in a prospective study involving another 10 children.\r"

The Caesarean section group had a total body clearance of (median) 31.5 (range 24.4-53.3) ml min-1 kg-1, apparent volume of distribution at steady state 5.10 (2.46-6.61) litre kg-1 and mean residence time 161 (52.3-251) min; values for the post-partum group were 33.8 (21.5-47.2) ml min-1 kg-1, 5.17 (3.47-8.09) litre kg-1 and 163 (92.3-238) min, respectively. The 95% confidence interval for the umbilical venous to maternal venous ratio of propofol at delivery was 0.62-0.86. Plasma protein binding studies showed there was less unbound propofol in maternal plasma (1.28-2.29%) compared with umbilical plasma (2.08-3.88%) (P less than 0.01). Neonatal concentrations of propofol were greater than maternal concentrations at 2 h and were in the range 0.05-0.11 micrograms ml-1 at 4 h.\r"

All patients were fasted for 6 h and then received paracetamol tablets 1.5 g orally with water 50 ml. Blood samples were taken at 15-min intervals for 120 min and analysed for paracetamol concentration. There was no significant difference between the groups in the maximum concentration and time to maximum concentration (ANOVA). The AUC was reduced for the first trimester group at 60 and 120 min (P less than 0.05). No significant delay in gastric emptying was demonstrated in any of the three trimesters of pregnancy compared with the control group.\r"

The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of ECG changes by echocardiographic assessment of cardiac function. Forty-five patients with intracranial aneurysms were studied. All patients had a 12-lead ECG and a two-dimensional echocardiogram. After patients with an history of chronic cardiac disease (n = 4) were excluded, only four patients were found to have wall motion abnormalities. These patients had only minor ECG abnormalities, but severe neurological dysfunction. Conversely, patients with other ECG abnormalities including the deep inverted T waves associated usually with SAH, had normal echocardiograms. We conclude that the ECG is not an accurate predictor of myocardial function after SAH and that myocardial dysfunction is related more closely to severity of neurological condition.\r"

Anaesthesia was maintained with 0.6% enflurane and 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen with assisted ventilation. Cardiac output and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously with a transthoracic impedence monitor. Mean HR did not change after induction in each group, but increased after tracheal intubation in both groups (P less than 0.01). Mean cardiac index (CI) decreased after induction (P less than 0.05) and decreased further after tracheal intubation in both groups (P less than 0.05). There was no difference between the two groups with respect to changes in CI and HR. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) did not change significantly after induction in the thiopentone group. Both variables increased from preinduction values 1 min after tracheal intubation (P less than 0.001). In contrast, both MAP and SVR decreased after induction in the propofol group (P less than 0.001) and did not differ from preinduction values 1 min after tracheal intubation. MAP and SVR were greater in the thiopentone group compared with the propofol group after induction and tracheal intubation (P less than 0.01).\r"

Sixty-six patients, ages 3-12 yr, undergoing outpatient surgery for correction of strabismus, were allocated randomly to receive either bilateral P6 acupressure or placebo during the perioperative period. The study was designed to detect a 50% difference in the incidence of postoperative vomiting between the two groups, with a 90% power of achieving a statistically significant result at the 5% level (two-tailed). The incidence of postoperative vomiting for the placebo group was 58% before discharge from hospital, 73% at home and 82% in the first 24 h after surgery. The corresponding results for the acupressure group were 58% before discharge, 71% at home and 94% in the first 24 h. These differences were not significant; P6 acupressure did not reduce the incidence of postoperative vomiting in children undergoing strabismus surgery.\r"
