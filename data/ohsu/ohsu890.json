  ".W": "A cDNA encoding a receptor for murine interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was isolated from an expression library made from murine thymocytes. The clone was identified by transfecting the library into monkey COS cells and probing the transfected monolayer with radiolabeled murine IFN-gamma. Cells expressing the receptor were identified by autoradiography and plasmids encoding the receptor were directly rescued from those cells producing a positive signal. A partial cDNA so obtained was used to isolate a full-length cDNA from mouse L929 cells by conventional means. When this cDNA was expressed in COS cells it produced a specific binding site for murine IFN-gamma with an affinity constant similar to that of the receptor found on L929 cells. The predicted amino acid sequence of the murine IFN-gamma receptor shows homology to that previously reported for the human IFN-gamma receptor. However, although the two proteins are clearly related, they show less than 60% identity in both the putative extracellular domain and the intracellular domain.\r"

Hybrid cell lines were constructed by fusing an IL-3-producing mastocytoma cell line with its IL-3-dependent normal parental cell. Unlike the mastocytoma parent cell line, hybrid cell lines required growth factor for in vitro proliferation, indicating that the IL-3-dependent phenotype is dominant. IL-3 mRNA, expressed at high levels in the tumor cells, appeared down-regulated in the cell hybrids. In contrast, p21v-Ha-ras levels were not reduced in the hybrids. The hybrid lines generated tumors in vivo with drastically prolonged latency times when compared to the tumor parent (10 versus 2 weeks). We propose that down-regulation of IL-3 mRNA production after cell fusion is responsible for the loss of growth autonomy in the hybrids and is likely to play a role in the partial suppression of tumor formation in vivo. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that a tumor suppressor, present in PB-3c cells, acts as a negative regulator of IL-3 expression.\r"

  ".W": "All extant organisms are though to be classified into three primary kingdoms, eubacteria, eukaryotes, and archaebacteria. The molecular evolutionary studies on the origin and evolution of archaebacteria to date have been carried out by inferring a molecular phylogenetic tree of the primary kingdoms based on comparison of a single molecule from a variety of extant species. From such comparison, it was not possible to derive the exact evolutionary relationship among the primary kingdoms, because the root of the tree could not be determined uniquely. To overcome this difficulty, we compared a pair of duplicated genes, elongation factors Tu and G, and the alpha and beta subunits of ATPase, which are thought to have diverged by gene duplication before divergence of the primary kingdoms. Using each protein pair, we inferred a composite phylogenetic tree with two clusters corresponding to different proteins, from which the evolutionary relationship of the primary kingdoms is determined uniquely. The inferred composite trees reveal that archaebacteria are more closely related to eukaryotes than to eubacteria for all the cases. By bootstrap resamplings, this relationship is reproduced with probabilities of 0.96, 0.79, 1.0, and 1.0 for elongation factors Tu and G and for ATPase subunits alpha and beta, respectively. There are also several lines of evidence for the close sequence similarity between archaebacteria and eukaryotes. Thus we propose that this tree topology represents the general evolutionary relationship among the three primary kingdoms.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the influence of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) on tumorigenicity, we established constitutively IFN-gamma-producing cell lines from a malignant mouse neuroblastoma, C1300, by retroviral transfer of a mouse IFN-gamma cDNA. The gene-transferred cells generally showed an enhanced high-level expression of the major histocompatibility complex class I antigens at the cell surface and the transcription levels, irrespective of their IFN-gamma-producing potential. Although in vitro cell growth of these cells was unaffected by the IFN-gamma production, their s.c. tumor growth in syngeneic A/J mice was dependent upon levels of IFN-gamma production; tumors induced by a low-producer line grew well at a rate similar to those induced by the parental one, but tumor growth of a high-producer line was strongly suppressed. This apparent tumor suppression was abolished by simultaneous i.p. injection of anti-Lyt2.2 and/or anti-IFN-gamma monoclonal antibodies, and subsequently large tumors of the high producer were generated. Anti-asialoganglioside GM1 antibodies allowed the high-producer line to induce a substantial but only transient tumor growth, whereas other antibodies, such as anti-Lyt2.1, anti-IFN-beta, and anti-activated macrophage, had no such effect. The mice immunized with the high-producer line were resistant to tumor growth of the parental cells but permitted another kind of A/J tumor line, Sa-1, to induce remarkable tumors. These results indicate that the reduced tumorigenicity of the IFN-gamma high-producer line was due to the augmented specific anti-tumor immunity, in which cytotoxic T lymphocytes seemed to play a decisive role, probably as a result of the immunomodulatory effects of the IFN-gamma derived from the tumor.\r"

These mutant peptide constructs, which do not occur in nature, also compete with the self-antigen for the in vivo induction of T cells primed with the encephalitogen AcN1-11. By using these nonpathogenic competitor peptides, it is possible to prevent the development of a prototypic T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These results suggest possibilities for the utilization of competitor peptides for therapy of T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases linked to specific major histocompatibility complex genes.\r"

  ".U": "90083290\r", 
  ".W": "Type II collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice is an autoimmune experimental model for rheumatoid arthritis. Susceptibility to CIA is associated with certain major histocompatibility complex class II haplotypes. The two very closely related haplotypes H-2q and H-2p differ in susceptibility to CIA. Only mice of H-2q (DBA/1, B10G strains) but not mice of H-2p-expressing strains (like strain B10P) develop CIA and an autoimmune response to type II collagen (CII) after immunization with CII. In contrast to H-2p, the H-2q haplotype does not express I-E molecules. The purpose of the present study was to identify, at the molecular level, the structures on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules determining susceptibility to CIA and CII responsiveness. We first excluded the possible suppressive involvement of Ep or Ap molecules by showing that F1 hybrids between H-2p and H-2q haplotype strains, expressing Ep and Ap, are responders to CII and fully susceptible to CIA. Secondly, because A alpha chains appear identical, we sequenced the A beta first-domain exons of p and q allotypes and found only four diverging amino acids in the predicted amino acid sequence. These variable residues were closely located at positions 85, 86, 88, and 89 at the end of the postulated alpha-helix, which is of importance for interactions with the antigenic peptide and the T-cell receptor. We suggest that this region is a critical major histocompatibility complex restriction site for CIA and CII responsiveness in H-2q mice as compared with H-2p mice. The CIA will now be an excellent autoimmune model for studies on interactions between autoantigenic peptide, autoreactive T cells, and a particular major histocompatibility complex molecule, as has been postulated to be the initial event also in rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

The sequences of four new DP beta alleles derived from these patients and controls are reported, bringing the total number of alleles identified thus far to 19. The DPB2.1 allele is significantly increased in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patients over controls; this allele is not increased in patients with adult rheumatoid arthritis. The association of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with the DPB2.1 allele is independent of linkage with previously defined HLA-D region markers of disease. Analysis of the DPB2.1 sequence shows that it differs from the nonsusceptible DPB4.2 allele by only 1 amino acid at position 69 in the beta 1 domain.\r"

We sought a relationship between COX deficiency and abnormalities of mtDNA at the single-fiber level. COX deficiency clearly correlated with a decrease of normal mtDNA and, conversely, deleted mtDNA was more abundant in COX-deficient fibers, especially ragged-red fibers. The distribution of mtRNA had a similar pattern, suggesting that deleted mtDNA is transcribed. Immunocytochemistry showed that the nuclear DNA-encoded subunit IV of COX was present but that the mtDNA-encoded subunit II was markedly diminished in COX-deficient ragged-red fibers. Because the mtDNA deletion in this patient did not comprise the gene encoding COX subunit II, COX deficiency may have resulted from lack of translation of mtRNA encoding all three mtDNA-encoded subunits of COX.\r"

All the procedures induced c-Fos immunoreactivity in parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, and many of these neurons also contained corticotropin-releasing factor immunoreactivity. c-Fos immunoreactivity was also observed, for example, in subpopulations of neurons in the locus coeruleus, the ventrolateral medulla oblongata, and the nucleus tractus solitarii. Many of these cells also expressed catecholamine-synthesizing enzymes. The results suggest that intraventricular injection of colchicine is a stressful stimulus and support the view that several catecholamine cell groups in the lower brainstem are part of the brain circuitry mediating stress reactions, as are the hypothalamic neurons that contain corticotropin-releasing factor.\r"

  ".U": "90083320\r", 
  ".W": "Stimulation of the region antero-ventral to the third cerebral ventricle (AV3V) by a cholinergic drug, carbachol, and lesions of the AV3V have been demonstrated in previous studies to either augment or decrease sodium excretion, respectively. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) dramatically increases renal sodium excretion and has been localized to brain areas previously shown to be involved in control of sodium excretion. Consequently, to evaluate a possible role of brain ANP in evoking the changes in renal sodium excretion that follow stimulations or lesions of the AV3V, we determined the effect of injection of carbachol into the AV3V of rats on the concentration of plasma ANP and its content in several neural tissues, the pituitary gland, lungs, and atria. Conversely, the effect of lesions in the AV3V on plasma ANP and the content of the polypeptide in the various organs was determined. Injection of carbachol into the AV3V produced the expected natriuresis, which was accompanied within 20 min by a dramatic rise in the plasma ANP concentration and a rise in ANP content in the medial basal hypothalamus, the neurohypophysis, and particularly the anterior hypophysis but without alterations in the content of ANP in the lungs or the right or left atrium. Conversely, there was a dramatic decline in plasma ANP at both 24 and 120 hr after the AV3V lesions had been placed. This was accompanied by a slight decline in the content of the peptide in the lungs. There was no change in its content in the right atrium at 24 hr after lesions, but there was a significant increase at 120 hr. There was a small decline in the content in the left atrium at 24 hr, followed by a rebound to slightly elevated levels at 120 hr. These small changes contrasted sharply with the dramatic decline in content of the peptide in the medial basal hypothalamus, median eminence, neurohypophysis, choroid plexus, anterior hypophysis, and olfactory bulb. These declines persisted or became greater at 120 hr; except in the olfactory bulb in which the decline was no longer significant. The dramatic increase in plasma ANP after carbachol stimulation of the AV3V that was accompanied by marked elevations in content of the peptide in basal hypothalamus and neuro- and adenohypophysis suggests that the natriuresis resulting from this stimulation is brought about at least in part by release of ANP from the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90083635\r", 
  ".W": "The efficacy and toxicity of oral azidothymidine has been studied in 145 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC). The median survival time of AIDS patients on azidothymidine was 4.5 times higher when compared to a historical AIDS group who had not received the drug. This result must be interpreted with caution because of changes in treatment of HIV infection and growing awareness of AIDS which may have led to earlier diagnosis in the group treated with azidothymidine. The mortality was significantly higher in those patients who received transfusions and was particularly high in those who were transfused before azidothymidine. There was a significant difference in the occurrence of opportunistic infections in the patients who received transfusions compared with those who did not. AIDS patients treated immediately after an episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia survived significantly longer than those in whom treatment was delayed for three months or more, and longer than those who were treated with azidothymidine because of another opportunistic infection or Kaposi's sarcoma. The T4 cell median counts increased in patients treated with azidothymidine reaching a peak at the end of the fourth month of treatment in the ARC group and at the end of the first month in the AIDS group with a subsequent fall in both groups. Sixty per cent of patients were p24 viral antigen positive at the start of treatment and 19 per cent of these patients had a fall of more than 50 per cent in antigen level while 32 per cent became antigen negative following treatment with azidothymidine. The mortality in the patients where the antigen disappeared or in whom there was a major fall of more than 50 per cent in antigen level was significantly less than in those where there was no change in antigen level. Twenty-nine patients were treated with azidothymidine because of skin Kaposi's sarcoma and in 17 tumour regressed or was stable. Thirty-two per cent of patients treated with azidothymidine became anaemic. Neutropenia occurred in 3 per cent of patients. Platelets increased initially after treatment but subsequently fell to thrombocytopenic levels in eight patients. Nine of 12 patients with thrombocytopenia before azidothymidine was commenced responded with an increased platelet count.\r"

The primary structural requirements for PI-linkage were examined by constructing a series of hybrid cDNA molecules. Although both cDNA's have an identical COOH-terminal hydrophobic segment, CD16-I has Ser203 whereas CD16-II has Phe203. Conversion of Phe to Ser in CD16-II permits expression of a PI-glycan-anchored glycoprotein, whereas conversion of Ser to Phe in CD16-I prevents PI-glycan linkage.\r"

Although this complex has been proposed to function as a transcriptional regulator in neurons, no specific target gene has yet been identified. Proenkephalin mRNA increased in the hippocampus during seizure just after an increase in c-fos and c-jun expression was detected. Fos-Jun complexes bound specifically to a regulatory sequence in the 5' control region of the proenkephalin gene. Furthermore, c-fos and c-jun stimulated transcription from this control region synergistically in transactivation assays. These data suggest that the proenkephalin gene may be a physiological target for Fos and Jun in the hippocampus and indicate that these proto-oncogene transcription factors may play a role in neuronal responses to stimulation.\r"

These sequence alterations could be most easily explained by specific post-transcriptional nucleotide modifications. Most of the nucleotide exchanges in coding regions lead to altered codons in the mRNA that specify amino acids better conserved in evolution than those encoded by the genomic DNA. Several instances show that the genomic arginine codon CGG is edited in the mRNA to the tryptophan codon TGG in amino acid positions that are highly conserved as tryptophan in the homologous proteins of other species. This editing suggests that the standard genetic code is used in plant mitochondria and resolves the frequent coincidence of CGG codons and tryptophan in different plant species. The apparently frequent and non-species-specific equivalency of CGG and TGG codons in particular suggests that RNA editing is a common feature of all higher plant mitochondria.\r"

The technique originally described, the pull method, involves puncturing the apposed gastric and abdominal walls under endoscopic control. A suture is then passed from the exterior into the gastric lumen and grasped with a snare. The suture is pulled out of the mouth, affixed to the end of a gastrostomy tube, and then pulled back down into the stomach. The gastrostomy tube is thus pulled into the stomach, and its end exits the abdominal wall. Modifications of this technique have included pushing the gastrostomy tube over a guidewire (the push method) and direct puncture of the stomach under endoscopic control with an introducer and outer peel-away sheath. All of these methods have been used with good results. Complications have included infection of the abdominal wall and intraperitoneal leakage. These may be minimized by attention to detail. The indications for the method have been expanded to include gastric decompression, administration of unpalatable medications in children, and creation of a conduit for bile replacement. Careful judgment in patient selection is crucial if good results are to obtained. This technique also introduces the concept of percutaneous endoscopic fixation of a loop of bowel to the abdominal wall. This concept may be employed in other areas of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

Regional cerebral blood flow as a percentage of the baseline value at the detector with the lowest baseline value increased significantly 2 hours after both 400 mg and 800 mg pentoxifylline (p = 0.038 and p = 0.010, respectively).

The distributions of vascular CO2 reactivity to hypocapnia were also evaluated in 20 of the normal subjects (mean age 34 years), including 11 younger normals less than 30 years old (mean age 24 years) and nine older (middle-aged or elderly) normals greater than or equal to 30 years old (mean age 45 years). The hyperfrontal distribution of regional cerebral blood flow observed in the young and middle-aged normals was not observed in the elderly normals. The hyperfrontal distribution of vascular CO2 reactivity observed in the younger normals was absent in the older normals. In addition, the correlation between regional cerebral blood flow and vascular CO2 reactivity observed in the younger normals was disturbed in the older normals. The data show a hyperfrontal distribution of regional cerebral blood flow in normal subjects that diminishes during the fifth and sixth decades, along with a distribution of vascular CO2 reactivity in younger normal subjects that is not homogeneous throughout the frontoparietal regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide and 7B2 were not significantly different from those in control subjects, but that of atrial natriuretic peptide was significantly lower. Although the mean concentration of neuropeptide Y was not significantly higher than control, consecutive determinations showed an increase 6-11 days after the onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage. An initially high 7B2 concentration decreased gradually, although half the patients showed a second increase greater than 10 days after the onset. Considering the well-recognized vasoconstrictive effect of neuropeptide Y, it is possible that this increase in its concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid plays a role in the pathogenesis of the cerebral vasospasm that is often seen after subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

A total of 31 pairs of determinations were made. After anesthetic and surgical preparation of the baboons, cerebral blood flow was repeatedly determined using the stable xenon technique during saturation with 50% xenon in oxygen. Concurrently, cerebral blood flow was determined before and during xenon administration using 15-microns microspheres. In Group 1 (n = 7), xenon and microsphere determinations were made repeatedly during normocapnia. In Group 2 (n = 5), cerebral blood flow was determined using both techniques in each baboon during hypocapnia (PaCO2 = 20 mm Hg), normocapnia (PaCO2 = 40 mm Hg), and hypercapnia (PaCO2 = 60 mm Hg). Xenon and microsphere values in Group 1 were significantly correlated (r = 0.69, p less than 0.01). In Group 2, values from both techniques also correlated closely across all levels of PaCO2 (r = 0.92, p less than 0.001). No significant differences existed between the slopes or y intercepts of the regression lines for either group and the line of identity. Our data indicate that the stable xenon technique yields cerebral blood flow values that correlate well with values determined using radioactive microspheres across a wide range of cerebral blood flow rates.\r"

Final total body water was 60 +/- 4% of body weight in the MG group and 62 +/- 3% in the RG group (NS) indicating reference body composition was attained by both groups. Composition of weight gained was measured by energy and nitrogen balance from doubly labeled water and metabolic collection data. In early recovery, the percent (+/- SEM) protein, fat, and water in weight gain was 20 +/- 1%, 40 +/- 8%, and 40 +/- 10% in the MG group and 14 +/- 1%, 43 +/- 4%, and 43 +/- 12% in the RG group. In late recovery these were 13 +/- 1%, 42 +/- 7%, and 47 +/- 14% in the MG group and 12 +/- 1%, 46 +/- 4%, and 42 +/- 6% in the RG group.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 200 +/- 10 g received isovolemic diets that provided 50 kcal/d, 2 g/d amino acids, and 40% nonprotein calories as lipid for 3 d. The lipid source was either long-chain triglycerides (LCTs), medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), structured lipid (SL), or a physical mix (PM) of the oils used in SL. Burned rats enterally fed either SL (p less than 0.01) or PM (p less than 0.05) yielded significantly higher daily and cumulative nitrogen balances and rectus muscle and liver FSRs than those fed either LCTs or MCTs. Rats fed SL or MCTs maintained higher serum albumin concentrations than rats fed either PM or LCTs. This study shows that the enteral administration of a mixed fuel system containing SL or its PM improves protein anabolism and attenuates net protein catabolism after thermal injury.\r"

After treatment for a rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder at age 7 y, the patient developed severe malabsorption secondary to radiation enteritis and short bowel syndrome. As a result of profound malnutrition, growth and maturation were severely impaired. Initiation of home total parenteral nutrition at age 22 y led to an increase in height, substantial weight gain, advancement of bone age, and sexual maturation evidenced by appearance of secondary sex characteristics and normalization of hormone concentrations. The development of signs of puberty and a growth spurt appearing at this late age clearly show the potential for maturation and growth once malnutrition is corrected.\r"

In malnourished patients the body cell mass (BCM) increased significantly with 2 wk of TPN both with and without additional insulin. The rate of change of BCM was correlated to the total caloric intake, serum insulin concentration, age, and nutritional state. The resulting multiple linear regression demonstrated that the restoration of a depleted BCM was directly related to the caloric intake, plasma insulin concentration, and degree of malnutrition and was inversely related to age. The addition of insulin to TPN solutions increases the rate at which a malnourished state is corrected.\r"

  ".W": "Amino acid concentrations in plasma obtained from infants by heel puncture differ from those in venous plasma primarily because of skin contamination but data from the two sites might agree more closely in premature infants because of their poorly developed sweat glands. To evaluate the importance of sampling site, amino acids were analyzed by a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method in plasma obtained both by heel puncture and venipuncture in 14 premature infants. Histidine, tryptophan, alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, and serine were higher in capillary plasma. Tryptophan and glycine levels in capillary plasma correlated strongly with those in venous plasma. An additional wash with soap and water done in five infants did not eradicate the differences. Thus the lack of agreement between data from the two sites may be due to factors other than contamination.\r"

All infants received approximately 3 g amino acids and 80-90 kcal.kg body wt.d. Total-body protein synthesis was estimated by using three constant-infusion, end-product methods: enrichment of urinary urea and ammonia in response to a [15N]glycine label and exhaled carbon dioxide enrichment in response to a [1-13C]leucine label. No differences were seen in nitrogen retention between the two energy sources. The estimate of total-body protein turnover obtained from the 13C label was similar to that obtained with the [15N]urea label. No differences in turnover rates were observed between the two diet groups. Use of the glucose-plus-lipid fuel system enhanced energy storage and the reutilization of amino acid for protein synthesis.\r"

However, few data are available from the nursing home setting where tube feedings are used for extended periods. We reviewed 109 nursing facility charts in order to determine the incidence of, and risk factors for, aspiration pneumonia: 22.9% of gastrostomy tube-fed patients aspirated. A history of recent previous pneumonia was found in 40.7% of those who subsequently developed aspiration pneumonia. This was the only risk factor related (p less than 0.05) to subsequent aspiration pneumonia. No association was found with age, mental status, or the method of enteral formula administration (continuous vs. intermittent infusion). We conclude that patients with a previous history of pneumonia are a high risk group in which alternative forms of enteral alimentation (i.e., jejunostomy feedings) should be explored.\r"

For both these reasons, some clinicians recommend colonoscopy as the initial screening examination for these relatives. We used the results of a screening program of families of colon cancer patients to determine whether the tumor yield and costs justified this recommendation. Our study included 468 asymptomatic, first-degree relatives of large bowel neoplasia patients. Of these, 429 had only one relative with colorectal neoplasia and 39 had two or more such relatives. Persons with one affected relative were screened by fecal occult blood and flexible sigmoidoscopy, followed by colonoscopy if either test was positive, whereas colonoscopy was used as the primary screening test for those with two or more relatives with colorectal neoplasia. The comparison group included 452 persons without this family history of large bowel neoplasia. They were screened with fecal occult blood tests and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Based on a range of costs in the United States, and taking into account the hypothetical increased yield of screenees with neoplasia detected if colonoscopy was used as the primary screening examination, calculations of costs indicate that screening asymptomatic adults by colonoscopy is markedly (4-fold) more cost-effective if they have two or more first-degree colon cancer relatives. Otherwise, screening families with only 1 affected relative by flexible sigmoidoscopy, together with fecal occult blood, would seem the most economic method.\r"

  ".W": "Recently two peptides consisting of amino acids (a.a.) 1-30 and 31-67 of the N-terminus of the 126 a.a. prohormone of atrial natriuretic factor (pro ANF), as well as atrial natriuretic factor (ANF, a.a. 99-126; C-terminus) were found to have vasodilatory and natriuretic properties. These peptides, as well as ANF, circulate in man as part of the N-terminus of the prohormone. To determine the effect of graded exercise on the circulating concentration of the N-terminus and C-terminus of the ANF prohormone in persons with abnormal salt and water metabolism, 12 individuals with stable congestive heart failure (CHF) were evaluated before and after bicycle exercise testing and the results were subdivided based on the maximal exercise they could achieve. In all of the CHF patients, the circulating concentration of the whole N-terminus (ie, a.a. 1-98), the midportion of the N-terminus (pro ANF 31-67), which circulates as a distinct 3900 molecular weight (m.w.) peptide after being proteolytically cleaved from the N-terminus, and the C-terminus (ANF) increased with exercise. The patients who were able to achieve 100 and 125 watts of workload had a greater maximal oxygen consumption and, in general, a greater percent increase in the circulating concentration of both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the ANF prohormone than those who had less exercise capacity. Evaluation of the echocardiographic, radionucleotide, and the exercise parameters revealed that the circulating concentrations of these atrial peptides correlated best with left atrial dimension, but that left ventricular systolic and diastolic dimensions also correlated positively with their concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine the effects of ANP on chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in man, alpha-human ANP (200 micrograms) was infused (20 micrograms/min X 10 min) into the right atrium via a Swan-Ganz catheter in four patients with pulmonary hypertension of high altitude. Following the infusion, pulmonary arterial pressure fell gradually and remained depressed for 1 hour. Peak reductions in pulmonary arterial systolic pressure (PASP) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) were 23% and 30%, respectively. Systemic arterial pressure, cardiac output and cardiac index also tended to decrease, but these changes did not reach statistical significance. The data suggest that ANP is useful in the treatment of chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension in man.\r"

Because of the malignant intraocular aspect, the optic nerve glioma was extirpated. Histologic examination confirmed the diagnosis of an optic nerve glioma with intraocular extension, seeding, and iris nodules. In this juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma with secondary perineural fibrous hyperplasia, several mitoses were found in the orbital and intraocular parts. In the optic canal, three small islands were found that were compatible with the diagnosis of malignant astrocytoma, grade 3. The iris nevi appeared as iris pits and not like the Lisch nodules typical of neurofibromatosis. Cafe au lait spots were present on the skin. The family history was positive for neurofibromatosis. The results of this study demonstrate that optic gliomas are true astrocytomas and not hamartomas, and have a continuous scale from benign to malignant differentiation.\r"

This led to osteoarthritic lesions, such as matrix depletion, chondrocyte proliferation, and osteophyte formation, in the injected knee joints within several weeks. After injection of iodoacetate and papain, the main osteoarthritic alterations were localized in the femoropatellar joint, whereas injection of collagenase led to marked osteoarthritic lesions in the femorotibial joint. The mechanism of induction of these alterations appears to differ for iodoacetate and papain on one site and collagenase on the other site. Data are presented that collagenase injection, by way of damaging ligaments and tendons, destabilizes the knee joint eventually leading to osteoarthritic alterations. In contrast, injection of papain or iodoacetate directly interferes with cartilage metabolism resulting in osteoarthritic changes.\r"

In the present studies, both TRH (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and RO 15-4513 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed ethanol-induced depression of locomotor activity, in accord with previous reports. However, the benzodiazepine antagonist, RO 15-1788, blocked this action of RO 15-4513, while exerting no effect on the analeptic action of TRH. Using a model of seizure activity electrically elicited from the inferior colliculus, ethanol exerted a dose-related attenuation of seizure activity. This anticonvulsant action of ethanol was not altered by TRH (30 mg/kg, i.p.), but RO 15-4513 (3 mg/kg) reversed the effect of the 0.5, but not the 1.0 g/kg, dose of ethanol. In addition, pretreatment with RO 15-4513 (1 or 3 mg/kg, i.p.), but not TRH (30 mg/kg, i.p.), caused seizure generalization into the forebrain following inferior collicular stimulation, further verifying the proconvulsant properties of RO 15-4513. In conclusion, the analeptic action of TRH appears independent of benzodiazepine activity, and in contrast to RO 15-4513, TRH does not exhibit proconvulsant properties. Furthermore, because TRH did not antagonize both depressant actions of ethanol studied, it appears unlikely that TRH directly interacts with the molecular basis of ethanol action.\r"

The subjects underwent nasal challenge with antigen after premedication with either cetirizine (20 mg QD for two days, n = 10), terfenadine (60 mg BID for 1 week, n = 12), or placebo for equivalent periods of time. We monitored the response to challenge by counting the number of sneezes and by measuring the levels of inflammatory substances in recovered nasal lavages. Compared with placebo, both antihistamines significantly reduced sneezing and the levels of recovered albumin and TAME esterase activity, suggesting that both reduced the expected increase in vascular permeability. With cetirizine, there was also a reduction in the levels of LTC4 (not measured in terfenadine studies) but not in those of recovered histamine and prostaglandin D2. These data suggest that cetirizine did not affect mast cell mediator release, that histamine release is due to the direct action of antigen stimulation and that leukotrienes are generated by cells in addition to mast cells. With terfenadine, there were significant reductions in the levels of histamine and kinins (not measured in cetirizine study) seen after nasal challenge with antigen. The reduction in kinins most likely reflects alteration in vascular permeability, whereas the effect on histamine presumably reflects inhibition of mast cell activation. When combined, these experiments demonstrate effects of H1 antihistamines on histamine release beyond those usually described, as well as differences between drugs within a single classification.\r"

As with many behavioral constructs, attempts at quantification are difficult, and consequently, subjective reports of antihistamine sedation are frequently relied upon. Evoked potential activity is one method to quantitate the brain's response to subtle cognitive change. Evoked potentials are characteristic shifts in the brain's electrical activity that are obtained by time-locking the ongoing EEG to a stimulus over repeated trials. A late positive component of the evoked potential (P3) has been related to various psychologic properties including expectation, selective attention, and information processing speed. Because of this relationship, we employed the latency of the P3 evoked potential to measure the cognitive effects of chlorpheniramine and terfenadine. In healthy young subjects, we observed that terfenadine produces significantly less cognitive slowing of the P3 potential than chlorpheniramine. This finding supports the subjective findings of reduced sedative side effects of terfenadine.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of drugs to inhibit histamine-induced wheals has been used frequently as a pharmacodynamic index of clinical efficacy. Host response using this model can be predictive of clinical response in atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and urticaria. Terfenadine is a widely used nonsedating antihistamine currently approved for use at a dosage of 60 mg every 12 hours. Our clinical trial was designed to determine whether higher dosages of this agent were associated with amplified efficacy in suppressing the wheal response to intradermal histamine phosphate. Twenty-six healthy male Caucasian volunteers were randomized in a double-blind crossover fashion to receive terfenadine 60 mg every 12 hours, 120 mg each day, 120 mg every 12 hours, and placebo. Each dose was given orally for three days followed by a 6-day washout period. Histamine was administered intradermally one hour prior to dosing for baseline measurements. Histamine was given at defined intervals after treatment or placebo on days 1 (acute dosing) and 3 (steady state), and the percent inhibition of histamine-induced wheal area as compared with baseline was determined. Subjects receiving all three active doses exhibited significant wheal inhibition compared with placebo on days 1 and 3 (P less than or equal to .01). Subjects receiving the 60 mg every 12 hours and the 120 mg each day dosages exhibited roughly equivalent mean wheal suppression over the 24-hour period of each testing day (54% versus 60%, respectively, on day 1 and 62% versus 63%, respectively, on day 3, no significant differences).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Terfenadine was compared for efficacy in treatment regimens of 120 mg once daily (qd) and 60 mg twice daily (bid) in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis in double blind, randomized, parallel 1-week studies, three in Europe (one multicenter study, three sites; n = 191) and one in the US (single center; n = 201). Patients had moderate or severe symptoms for 2 or more years and positive skin tests to relevant pollen antigens. On entry and final visit individual symptoms were rated by physicians on a visual analog scale in Europe and a numerical scale in the US. Most patients filled out daily symptom diaries during the studies. Individual symptom scores and total symptom scores, (calculated by adding individual symptom scores together) as assessed by physicians and patients, were similar at baseline for both treatment regimens on entry, with improvement during the week. There were more patients with complete and marked relief in Europe than in the US. (Total symptom scores as assessed by physicians, for instance, improved from baseline ratings of 407 for the 60 bid regimen and 431 for the 120 qd regimen in Europe to 102 and 95 at final visit, and in the US from 8.8 for 60 bid and 8.5 for the 120 qd to 4.5 and 4.1). There was no statistical difference between the two treatment regimens in Europe or the US. Terfenadine, 120 mg once daily, is as effective as the currently approved dosage of 60 mg twice daily in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, and terfenadine, 120 mg once daily, has the added convenience of allowing the patient once a day dosing.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, we used an in-vitro amplification technique to detect HIV-1 nucleic acid sequences in sequential aliquots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from homosexual men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. DESIGN and PATIENTS: Blinded, longitudinal study of 24 homosexual men who were positive for HIV-1 antibodies at a recent follow-up visit. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: Coded clinical samples were evaluated using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (whole virus and gp120-gp41 fragment), Western blot, a p24 antigen capture assay, virus cocultivation, and in-vitro amplification of conserved regions from the HIV-1 gag and env open-reading frames. In 20 of the 24 men an HIV-1 enzymatically amplified product was detected before HIV-1 antibody seroconversion: at 42 months before seroconversion in two cases; at 36 months in one case; at 30 months in one case; at 24 months in four cases; at 18 months in eight cases; at 12 months in one case; and at 6 months in three cases (median, 18 months). In the four other men, detection of an HIV-1 enzymatically amplified product was concurrent with confirmation of antibody seroconversion by Western blot. CONCLUSIONS: There is a long and variable interval between virus acquisition and a diagnostic serum antibody response, perhaps due to the prolonged, persistent infection characteristic of the lentiviruses (family Retroviridae).\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are classified as having the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a successful therapy for patients with lymphoma who have a poor prognosis. Combined therapy with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and the antiviral drug zidovudine has the potential advantage of protecting the new donor hematopoietic-lymphoid and monocyte-macrophage cells from HIV-1 infection. A 41-year-old man infected with HIV-1 who had lymphoma was treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Before transplantation he received high-dose zidovudine for 2 weeks (5 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 4 hours) and after transplantation he received a lower maintenance dose (1.33 mg/kg body weight intravenously every 4 hours). No untoward toxicities attributable to zidovudine were observed. Bone marrow engraftment occurred on day 17. Chromosome and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses demonstrated complete chimerism. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow samples were negative for HIV-1 by culture and polymerase chain reaction gene amplification 32 days after transplantation. The patient died 47 days after transplantation because of tumor relapse. Analysis of autopsy tissue showed no evidence of HIV-1 by either culture (brain, bone marrow, lymph node, and tumor specimens) or by polymerase chain reaction gene amplification for HIV-1 RNA and DNA sequences (brain, bone marrow, heart, kidney, liver, lung, rectosigmoid, spleen, and tumor specimens). Immunologic monitoring showed loss of HIV-1 antibody. Adoptive immunologic transfer was shown to be present to both tetanus and diphtheria antigens. Our case suggests that the HIV-1-infected recipient cells may have been eradicated secondary to the bone marrow ablative chemo-radiotherapy and that zidovudine may be able to prevent the establishment of HIV-1 infection in donor hematopoietic-lymphoid cells.\r"

We report the cases of six patients with intracranial hemorrhage after tPA treatment for acute myocardial infarction. None of the patients were hypertensive at admission, and only one was hypertensive during therapy. Intravenous tPA, 100 mg, was followed by continuous intravenous heparin infusion; intracranial hemorrhage occurred between 2 and 14 hours after tPA infusion ended and between 3 and 17 hours after heparin therapy was started. The partial thromboplastin time (PTT) was excessively prolonged (from 81 s to more than 150 s) in all patients at onset of intracranial hemorrhage. The intracerebral hematomas were predominantly of lobar location, and two patients had multiple simultaneous hemorrhages. Four patients died from massive intracranial hemorrhage; the mechanism for these hemorrhages was unclear. Factors possibly related to hemorrhage include a systemic fibrinolytic state or a platelet anti-aggregant effect produced by tPA and enhanced hemorrhagic tendency caused by the combined effects of tPA and heparin. Local vascular changes at the bleeding site remain as potential contributing factors for isolated intracranial hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "With the pH-stat acid-base regulation strategy during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), carbon dioxide (CO2) is generally administered to maintain the partial pressure of arterial CO2 at a higher level than with the alpha-stat method. With preserved CO2 vasoreactivity during CPB, this induction of \"respiratory acidosis\" can lead to a much higher cerebral blood flow level than is motivated metabolically. To evaluate CO2 vasoreactivity, cerebral blood flow was measured using a xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after CPB at different CO2 levels in patients who were undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with perfusion at either hypothermia or normothermia. The overall CO2 reactivity was 1.2 mL/100 g/min/mm Hg. There was no difference between the groups. The CO2 reactivity was not affected by temperature or CPB. The induced hemodilution resulted in higher cerebral blood flow levels during CPB, although this was counteracted by the temperature-dependent decrease in the hypothermia group. After CPB, a transient increase in cerebral blood flow was noted in the hypothermia group, the reason for which remains unclear. The study shows that manipulation of the CO2 level at different temperatures results in similar changes in cerebral blood flow irrespective of the estimated metabolic demand. This finding further elucidates the question of whether alpha-stat or pH-stat is the most physiological way to regulate the acid-base balance during hypothermic CPB.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) may contribute to tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis, in part, by inducing messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes interstitial collagenase. In human synovial fibroblasts in vitro, IL-1 induced collagenase mRNA accumulation 6 hours after being added to the cells. High levels of mRNA remained present for at least 48 hours after treatment. The rate of transcription of collagenase in isolated nuclei peaked after approximately 6 hours of treatment with IL-1 and declined thereafter, becoming nearly undetectable by 24 hours. The persistence of mRNA, in view of the transient peak of transcription, suggested that collagenase mRNA was stable in synovial fibroblasts. The half-life of collagenase mRNA after the synoviocytes were treated with actinomycin D was approximately 27 hours, both in the presence and in the absence of IL-1. It has been noted that induction of the expression of collagenase by phorbol esters requires fos protein synthesis and is mediated through a tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate response element in the 5'-flanking region of the gene. However, we found that cycloheximide, when added to synovial fibroblast cultures up to 6 hours after treatment with IL-1, inhibited the expression of collagenase mRNA. These results suggest that fos alone is unlikely to be sufficient for collagenase expression, and that additional factors, or alternative pathways, are involved in the induction of collagenase by IL-1.\r"

The major gag protein of SIVcpz migrated on SDS-PAGE with a relative molecular mass of 25.5 and the outer membrane proteins were 110, 155 and 185 kD, respectively. SIVcpz did not induce severe cytopathic effects in human and chimpanzee lymphocytes. Antigenically, SIVcpz seems to be closer to HIV-1 than to HIV-2 and the other SIVs. Nucleic acid hybridization experiments appear to indicate that the virus is different from HIV-1 and HIV-2.\r"

An epidemiologic study of 54 seropositive and 58 seronegative donors was carried out. The HIV serologic status did not change in any of these donors after repeat testing. Only 13.0% of the seropositives and 15.5% of the seronegatives had any of the known risk factors for AIDS. There was a direct relationship between frequency of plasma donation and the risk of being seropositive. A survey of employees disclosed the frequent re-use of disposable blood collection equipment. We conclude that HIV transmission had probably occurred in this plasma collection center.\r"

Only lectins which bound at least one of the four types of glycans were capable of inhibiting fusion of HIV-infected cells with CD4 cells by a carbohydrate-specific interaction with the HIV-infected cells.

Sixty-four babies born to anti-HIV-1-positive mothers and 130 control babies born to anti-HIV-1-negative mothers were followed up for 12-22 months (mean, 18 months). The probabilities of survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. At birth, the two groups of babies did not differ with regard to rate of stillbirths, gestational age, sex ratio and weight. Among babies born to seropositive mothers, the probability of survival was 0.87 (s.d. 0.04) at 3 months, 0.71 (s.d. 0.06) at 6 months, 0.68 (s.d. 0.06) at 9 months and 0.61 (s.d. 0.06) at 12.5 months. In the controls the probability of survival was 0.98 (s.d. 0.01) at 3 months and 0.97 (s.d. 0.02) at 12 months. The excess of mortality in the babies born to anti-HIV-1-positive mothers is highly significant (P less than 0.001). The deaths occurred more frequently and earlier than in similar cohort studies performed in developed countries.\r"

Four men attributed their conversion to mental health problems or to drug and alcohol use. Two men's seroconversions could not be ascertained and one man attributed seroconversion to a condom break. Most men who had learned how to avoid infection, and had successfully done so for a time, had knowingly engaged in unsafe behaviors because of strong emotional responses to certain partners or because of mental health or drug and alcohol-related problems. Skills training for dealing with partners who pressure men to behave unsafely is needed, as is mental health and drug and alcohol counseling for men at risk for HIV infection.\r"

Neutrophils from patients with AIDS produced less leukotriene immunoreactivity when appropriately stimulated than neutrophils from healthy controls, whereas no significant difference could be detected between HIV-antibody-positive individuals without AIDS and healthy controls. This observation may be pertinent to the recurrence of some of the opportunistic infections associated with AIDS but more importantly, if reflecting a general defect in leukotriene production, it may provide further understanding of the mechanism which leads to reduced natural killer-cell activity, interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma production in AIDS.\r"

Saponin B2 also inhibited HIV infection, although less potently. Both saponin B1 and B2 had no direct effect on the reverse transcriptase activity of HIV. Saponin B1 also inhibited HIV-induced cell fusion in the MOLT-4 cell system.

A 49-year-old man with NYHA Class IV end-stage heart failure received a J-7-70 TAH as a bridge to transplantation. Pre-TAH cardiac index was less than 2 L/min/m2 with end organ dysfunction, increased venous and pulmonary pressures, and a low arterial pressure. The TAH provided an immediate cardiac index greater than 3 L/min/m2 with normal hemodynamics and organ function. Pre-TAH renin, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) levels were markedly elevated: 147 ng/dl, 29.4 ng/dl, and 380 pg/ml, respectively. All values declined dramatically by the fifth postoperative day, with the aldosterone and ANF values returning to normal at 11.5 ng/dl and 37 pg/ml, respectively. Renin levels reached normal values by the fourth postoperative week. Once normal values were obtained, they remained in this range for the 57 days of TAH function. The TAH, used in end-stage heart failure, restores normal hemodynamics and compensatory hormonal levels. These hormones can be used as indicators of proper TAH function in such patients.\r"

  ".W": "It was previously demonstrated that with nutritional hemodialysis (NH), an adaptation of continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis (CAVHD), glucose and aminoacids are efficiently transferred from the dialysate to the patient. Intravenous monitors were used to control dialysate flow and ultrafiltration, and a water manometer provided fail-safe operation. Pressure measurements with low flux dialyzers indicated that a gravity system was possible. This observation formed the basis for the current study. Nutrient dialysate was prepared by adding glucose and amino acid to a bicarbonate dialysate. Subsequently, the bicarbonate dialysate was eliminated by reducing the dialysate volume and increasing the glucose concentration. Dialysate flow was controlled with a valve postdialyzer, and ultrafiltration adjusted by varying the height of the dialysate container. At a glucose concentration of 14.4 gm/dl and outflow rate of 3.9 ml/min, 97% of the glucose in the dialysate was transferred to the patient. Compared with intravenous nutrition, NH is as easy to perform, less costly, does not provide fluid, and is inherently fail-safe. As no equipment is required, many patients can be treated simultaneously. \"Machineless\" NH suggests the possibility of machineless CAVHD, which could provide dialysis and parenteral nutrition to many acute renal failure patients after a major disaster.\r"

We have also shown in vitro and in vivo that the calcium channel blocker verapamil (VPM) is able to normalize the previously high PLy and PM0 Ca++ concentrations, and cytokine release; to decrease fibroblast proliferation; and to increase UF in 60% of the CAPD patients with UF loss due to a cytokine-mediated hyperproliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts, while in the remaining 40% there is little improvement (VPM responders and low-responders, respectively). To evaluate which mechanisms, in addition to passive Ca++ influx, can play a role in the Ca++-dependent activation of peritoneal immune cells, we evaluated the effects in vitro of different doses of Ca++ alone; with VPM; and with 1,25(OH)2D3 on: 1) PLy and PM0 cytoplasmic Ca++ levels; 2) gamma-IFN and IL-1 release by PLy and PM0; and 3) peritoneal fibroblast proliferation in six CAPD VPM low-responder patients. Results showed a direct correlation between Ca++ levels in the medium and PLy and PM0 Ca++ concentrations; IL-1 and gamma-IFN release; and peritoneal fibroblast proliferation. These effects were enhanced by the addition of low doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the medium, while both high 1,25(OH)2D3 doses and verapamil abrogated the Ca++-induced PLy and PM0 activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Mean volume loss was 40.3 +/- 6.2 ml (0.2 ml/day) compared with previous results of 1.2 ml/day for pure Hexsyn diaphragms. The residual gas in the chamber was analyzed as nitrogen = 89.6 +/- 0.6%; oxygen = 1.5 +/- 1.1%; and carbon dioxide = 8.8 +/- 0.6%. The resulting gas composition is assumed equivalent to that of the tissue interface and was used in developing a diffusion model. For a complete left ventricular assist system (LVAS), gas diffusion at the arterial blood and tissue interface was simulated. The predicted time to reach a minimum volume of 90 ml (compliance volume equal to full pump stroke volume) was in excess of 1 year.\r"

This endoscopic procedure bypassed the nonfunctioning stomach and allowed for adequate nutrition. When hypoalbuminemia is present, the patient is predisposed to the possible complications of peritoneal sepsis, dialysis fluid leak, and wound dehiscence. The authors report a unique, enteric feeding tube that is a solution to the problem of continuing adequate, complication-free dialysis in a cachetic, hypoalbuminemic peritoneal dialysis patient with no available site for either temporary or permanent hemodialysis vascular access. The procedure does not violate the peritoneal cavity and has proven to be effective, acceptable to the patient, apparently safe, and easy for both staff and patient use.\r"

Drug administration, surgery, and other conditions, such as priming volume and blood flow rates, were identical in all experiments. All blood contacting surfaces (oxygenator, catheters, etc.) were HBS. The ECC periods were set for 24 hr (n = 3) and 5 days (n = 4). At no time was heparin administered. No complications occurred in any experiment. Partial thromboplastin time, activated clotting time, and other coagulation parameters remained within physiologic ranges. Platelets did not drop below 80% of baseline values, and hemolysis rates were negligible. Blood gas data and other vital parameters were normal during the entire ECC period. Results show that HBS can be applied to long-term ECC, without the necessity for heparin administration.\r"

  ".W": "To perform low blood flow extracorporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R), the authors developed a device for extracorporeal circulation (ECC) equipped with a dialyzer for the elimination of CO2 as bicarbonate. The major problem with this method was the decrease in blood pH. To control blood pH and clarify the limit of CO2 elimination using this method, a study with apneic dogs was performed. Six anesthetized mongrel dogs were intubated and paralyzed with a muscle relaxant. Vascular access was achieved with a venovenous bypass. ECC was initiated under apneic oxygenation (100% O2, 10 cm H2O continuous airway pressure), and the CO2 concentration in the airway outlet was measured. The CO2 was converted to bicarbonate using systemic infusion of trihydroxy-methylamino methane (THAM), and the generated bicarbonate was removed by hemodialysis. Blood flow rate in the ECC was 15 ml/kg/min, and the duration of ECC was 5 hr. During ECC, the hemodynamic parameters of the dogs were stable, and the PaCO2 remained at about 90 mmHg with a PaO2 above 350 mmHg; CO2 elimination from the airway was negligible.\r"

  ".W": "A limiting factor in using microporous capillary membrane oxygenators (CMO) for long-term extracorporeal lung support is leakage. Application of heparin-coated CMO requires additional examination because leakage is probably caused by the temperature conditions of the gas, the blood and the circuit environment, and the surface tension phenomenon at the micropores. The authors designed a thermostatized box in which the temperature of flowing gas (Tg) and blood (Tb), and the interior temperature of the box (Ti) could be regulated independently. Tb was adjusted to the animal's body temperature, and Tg was kept about 2 degrees C higher to prevent condensation of the evaporated fluid from the blood side, through the micropores, into the gas phase. Ti was maintained between Tg and Tb. The saturated outlet gas could therefore condense only outside the box. This system was used during 5 days of venovenous bypass using a covalently heparin-bonded (Carmeda) CMO (Maxima, Medtronic) in four adult sheep. No plasma leakage occurred, the surface tension of condensate water remained constant, and the gas exchange capacity of CMO was unchanged.\r"

This catheter was designed for single site cannulation of the internal jugular vein, thereby sparing the carotid artery from ligation. Cannulation was successful in 17 of 21 neonates, with 15 successful venovenous runs, whereas 2 of the 17 patients were converted to venoarterial bypass because of inadequate support. Oxygenation and CO2 removal were adequate in the remaining patients. Average time on bypass was 111 hours. All 15 patients survived, and exploration of the cannulation site for bleeding was required in three patients. Preoxygenator pressure, recirculation of oxygenated blood, and hemolysis were all within acceptable levels during each run. Venovenous extracorporeal life support with the double lumen catheter can replace venoarterial access in most cases of neonatal respiratory failure.\r"

The MOs used in this study are silicon sheet MOs and prototype MOs using a novel multilayered composite membrane. Respiratory support with this system, under systemic heparinization, could be conducted for 4-8 days without major problems. This method solved several difficulties with ECMO, such as surgical bleeding, serum leakage, destruction of the blood components from the pump system, inadequate bypass flow, and fatal systemic thrombosis. This method is suitable for long-term respiratory support, especially as a bridge before lung or heart-lung transplantation.\r"

Bridging periods lasted between 9 and 28 days. Atrial biopsies were taken during implantation, and after TAH explantation for histologic and histochemical investigations to evaluate differences in morphology and ANF-content of the specific atrial granules. Plasma concentrations of ANF (pANF), aldosterone (PAC) and renin (PRC) were measured daily, as were hemodynamic parameters. In the preoperative state, pANF was always markedly elevated, while during TAH bridging, pANF remained moderately elevated with fluctuations. A positive correlation between pANF levels and right atrial pressure (RAP) was seen in all patients (p less than 0.05). Slight correlation was also observed between pANF and left atrial pressure (LAP), but no correlation was seen between pANF and systemic blood pressure, and no consistent pattern was seen in the plasma concentrations of either renin or aldosterone. After heart transplantation (HTX), which was performed in 3 patients, pANF levels were significantly higher than during TAH, and continued to show a positive correlation with RAP. From our data, we conclude that ANF production sites and secretory mechanisms remain intact during TAH-bridging, although upon implantation of a TAH, the remaining atria are deprived of all coronary blood supply and most autonomic innervation.\r"

  ".W": "There has been increasing evidence indicating that islet transplantation may offer an ideal endocrine replacement therapy for patients with Type I diabetes mellitus. However, allogenic islets are susceptible to immune rejection. In 1980, Lim and Sun first reported a novel technique of microencapsulation by which pancreatic islets used as transplants could be encapsulated and immunoisolated so as to survive and function for a period of 2-3 weeks. By further improving the biocompatibility of the capsular membrane, Sun's group demonstrated that islet allografts can be protected from rejection for up to 21 months in nonimmunosuppressed, streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The biocompatible polymer capsule membrane constitutes a physical barrier to the host's immune system. Permeability of the membrane can be controlled to allow free diffusion of small molecular nutrients, hormones, and metabolites, but exclude lymphocytes, leukocytes, and macromolecular immunoglobulins and complement. Darquy and Reach, in 1985, disclosed the role of the microcapsule membrane in protecting islets from cytotoxic antibodies. Sun's group further demonstrated that the microencapsulation technique effectively protected xenografts of rat islets transplanted into diabetic mice. In a previous report, we described the success of allotransplanted microencapsulated rat islets in treating streptozotocin-induced diabetes in Wistar rats. We now report the in vitro study of human fetal islets microencapsulated within an alginate-polylysine membrane. A preliminary clinical trial of allotransplants for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetics is also presented.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective population study based on data collected from second screening (from 1974 to 1977) in the multifactor primary prevention trial and follow up until March 1983. SETTING--Gothenburg, Sweden. SUBJECTS--6897 Men aged 51 to 59, of whom 232 were self reported diabetics and 6665 were non-diabetic; none had a history of myocardial infarction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Incidences of coronary heart disease and mortality from all causes. RESULTS--Diabetic men with a serum cholesterol concentration greater than 7.3 mmol/l had a significantly higher incidence of coronary heart disease during follow up than those with a concentration less than or equal to 5.5 mmol/l (28.3% v 5.4%; p = 0.020); corresponding figures for non-diabetic men were 9.4% and 2.4% respectively. In multivariate logistic regression analyses serum cholesterol concentration and smoking habit were independent predictors of coronary heart disease (odds ratio serum cholesterol concentration 6.1 (95% confidence interval 2.1 to 17.6) current smoking 2.9 (1.1 to 7.5)) and of all cause mortality (3.2 (1.3 to 7.9), 3.0 (1.4 to 6.7) respectively) in diabetic men whereas systolic blood pressure, body mass index, family history, marital state, and alcohol abuse were not. Low occupational class was an independent predictor of mortality (2.4 (1.01 to 5.5)), but not of coronary heart disease, in diabetic men. CONCLUSIONS--Middle aged diabetic men with hypercholesterolaemia are at very high risk of developing coronary heart disease and of dying prematurely. Lowering serum cholesterol concentration in such subjects seems to be warranted.\r"

SETTING--All gastroenterology and x ray departments. PATIENTS--Any patient found to have an active ulcer crater during 1985. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Sex, age, past history of gastrointestinal ulcers, and smoking habit. RESULTS--In 1985, 1402 peptic ulcers were diagnosed in 1137 adults. Over half (403; 54%) of the ulcers in men and 393 (60%) ulcers in women were in patients aged over 60. All types of ulcer showed increasing incidence with age. The sex ratio of patients aged 40-50 with peptic ulcers was 1:1. Nearly half (109; 48%) of ulcers diagnosed for the first time in men and 129 (57%) of such ulcers in women were in patients aged over 60. Elderly men and women were also more likely to develop haemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS--In Gothenburg there is a surprisingly high incidence of peptic ulcer disease, which increases considerably with age, possibly explained by the availability of modern diagnostic techniques as 1121 (80%) ulcers had been diagnosed by gastroscopy. Compared with earlier studies there was no difference in the incidence between men and women aged 40-50.\r"

In all, 176 of the patients were traced, 164 having either died or received renal support treatment by the end of 1986. Nearly two thirds (107) of the patients received renal support treatment, which was renal transplantation in five and dialysis in 102. This is an increase on previous years. A third of the patients (57) died without having received renal support treatment. In 15 patients death was unavoidable and mainly from acute myocardial infarction (10 patients), but 28 patients (half of those who died untreated) died from renal failure, sometimes with fluid retention that was ascribed to heart failure (18 patients). Most of the patients would have benefited from renal support treatment. This neglect should no longer occur.\r"

Financial allocations to regions based on figures derived from the contract differed considerably if the material deprivation score was used instead of the underprivileged area score: Northern and Mersey regions gained over 50% of their allocation whereas East Anglia, Oxford, and South West Thames regions lost more than 30% of theirs.

From the results of information given and our own observations during a week's visit to the institute we conclude that a minority of carefully selected children with cerebral palsy and spina bifida, who have a relatively good prognosis, are educated at the institute; the education is carried out with appropriate medical, surgical, and orthotic intervention; and the children probably function better as a result of the intensive programme than do similar children in Britain in areas where therapy is scarce. They seem to achieve, however, what we would expect similar children in Britain to do when facilities are adequate. Though our findings do not therefore justify using public funds to refer children to the institute, some (self selected) families benefit from a visit, particularly from the positive attitudes of the staff. The role of the conductor and the integration of programmes into a classroom setting have much to recommend them, and conductive education, if successfully transferred to Britain, might be beneficial to a wider range of children than in Hungary.\r"

DESIGN--A systematic overview of all randomised trials of calcium channel blockers in myocardial infarction and unstable angina. PATIENTS--19,000 Patients in 28 randomised trials. RESULTS--In the trials of myocardial infarction 873 deaths occurred among 8870 patients randomised to active treatment compared with 825 deaths among 8889 control patients (odds ratio of 1.06, 95% confidence interval of 0.96 to 1.18). There was no evidence of a beneficial effect on development and size of infarcts or rate of reinfarction. The results were similar in short term trials in which treatment was confined to the acute phase and those in which treatment was started some weeks later and continued for a year or two. There was no evidence of heterogeneity among different calcium channel blockers in their effects on any end point. The results were similar in the unstable angina trials (110 out of 561 patients treated with calcium channel blocker compared with 104 out of 548 controls developed a myocardial infarction; 14 out of 591 treated compared with nine out of 578 controls died). CONCLUSIONS--Calcium channel blockers do not reduce the risk of initial or recurrent infarction or death when given routinely to patients with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina.\r"

DESIGN--An audit in which 14 regional health authorities and London special health authorities each designated a regional liaison officer to identify intensive care units and liaise with Department of Health and the Medical Research Council's biostatistics unit in distribution, return, and checking of audit forms. Audit took place from 1 January to 31 March 1989 and will continue to 31 December 1990. SETTING--278 Intensive care units in England. PARTICIPANTS--Colleagues in intensive care units (doctors, nurses, coordinators, and others), who completed serially numbered audit forms for all patients who died in intensive care. RESULTS--The estimated number of deaths in intensive care units was 3085, and validated audit forms were received for 2853 deaths (92%). Brain stem death was a possible diagnosis in only 407 (14%) patients (about 1700 cases a year) and was confirmed in 282 (10%) patients (an estimated 1200 cases a year). Half the patients (95% confidence interval 45% to 57%) in whom brain stem death was confirmed became actual donors of solid organs. Tests for brain stem death were not performed in 106 (26%) of 407 patients with brain stem death as a possible diagnosis, and general medical contraindication to organ donation was recorded for 48 (17%) of 282 patients who fulfilled brain stem death criteria before cessation of heart beat. The criteria were fulfilled before cessation of heart beat and in the absence of any general medical contraindication to organ donation in 234 patients, 8% of those dying in intensive care (an estimated 1000 cases a year). Consent for organ donation was given in 152 (70%) of 218 cases (64% to 76%) when the possibility of organ donation was suggested to relatives. In only 14 out of 232 families (6%; 3% to 9%) was there no discussion of organ donation with relatives. Corneal suitability was recorded as \"not known\" in a high proportion (1271; 45%) of all deaths and intensive care units reported only 123 corneal donors (4% of all audited deaths). CONCLUSION--When brain stem death is a possible diagnosis tests should always be carried out for confirmation. Early referral to the transplant team or coordinator should occur in all cases of brain stem death to check contraindications to organ donation. There should be increased use of asystolic kidney donation, and patients should be routinely assessed for suitability for corneal donation. Finally, more publicity and education are necessary to promote consent.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic retinopathy is an important cause of blindness in the Western World. A review of the randomised trials of laser photocoagulation of the retina as a method of preventing blindness from this disorder showed that this treatment is very effective, reducing the risk of blindness by 61% in a treated eye. As only one eye is needed for sight the reduction in blindness in a population will be greater than 61% because the effect of treatment in one eye is not always identical with the effect in the other eye. For analysis this reduction was taken as 73%, representing the average of the minimum and maximum estimates (61% and 85%). The effectiveness of this treatment suggests that there is the potential for a national screening programme to bring about a major reduction in blindness from this cause. A quantitative assessment of the effect of screening indicated that a programme in which patients with diabetes mellitus are systematically referred to ophthalmic opticians for a retinal examination could detect 88% of all diabetics with serious retinopathy and that 87% of these cases would be treatable. Screening and early treatment of retinopathy would prevent deterioration of visual acuity and could reduce the risk of blindness due to diabetic retinopathy by an estimated 56% (0.73 X 0.88 X 0.87). The findings suggest that an effectively managed community based screening programme encompassing detection, referral, treatment, and follow up would prevent about 260 new cases of blindness in diabetics under the age of 70 each year in England and Wales. This would represent over 10% of all cases of blindness in adults in this age group.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised crossover study of meal schedules comparing three meals a day with four or six meals a day, the four and six meal schedules both including a late evening meal (2300). SETTING--Metabolic ward. PATIENTS--Seven men and two women aged 34-66 with cirrhosis of the liver (Child's grade B). INTERVENTIONS--Patients spent two seven day periods in the ward. For five days of each period they received, in random order, isonitrogenous isocaloric diets supplied in three meals a day and in four or six meals a day. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Nitrogen balance, calculated as the difference between dietary intake and the total of urinary, faecal, and integumental nitrogen loss. RESULTS--Faecal nitrogen loss was no different between three meals a day and four or six meals a day. On both four and six meals a day, however, patients had nitrogen balances that were more positive (or less negative) than on three meals a day (1.26 (SD 2.1) g/24 h v 0.26 (2.2) g/24 h, p less than 0.01). Six meals a day did not produce significantly better improvements in nitrogen balance than four meals a day. CONCLUSIONS--A late evening meal seemed to improve the efficiency of nitrogen metabolism, but longer term studies are needed to assess whether this leads to a better nutritional state.\r"

We have therefore investigated the effects of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and streptokinase on platelet function at doses currently used for peripheral arterial thrombolysis. Platelet-rich plasma was stirred at 37 degrees C, with either streptokinase (100, 300 or 1000 units ml-1) or rt-PA (10 (T10), 30 (T30) and 100 (T100) mg l-1), with immediate addition of an agonist for platelet aggregation (thrombin, collagen, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adrenaline) at a predetermined threshold dose. Significant inhibition of collagen-induced and adrenaline-induced platelet aggregation was produced with rt-PA at all doses used (P less than 0.05). With adrenaline as the agonist, T100 produced disaggregation to a mean (s.d.) level of 26 per cent. Thrombin-stimulated platelet aggregation was significantly reduced by T100 (P less than 0.001) and T30 (P less than 0.01) only, disaggregation being dose-dependent and complete with T100. Using ADP as the agonist, T100 produced a significant reduction in maximum platelet aggregation (P less than 0.01), and disaggregation was achieved to a mean (s.d.) level of 48(13) per cent. Streptokinase did not produce any significant changes in any parameter of aggregation.\r"

Only surgical technique was found to be statistically significant on sequential multivariate analysis. Mass closure with polydioxanone was associated with a 1 per cent (one of 70) wound sepsis rate. Wound sepsis after pyloromyotomy is dependent on technique, and mass closure with polydioxanone is recommended. The routine use of tension sutures should be abandoned.\r"

The liquid preparations that were popular earlier in this century reflected fascination with bottled medicinals, consistent with the growing era of pharmaceutical medicine. Today's questionable remedies are similarly consistent with their social and cultural context. \"Metabolic\" therapies emphasizing diet, self care, vitamins, and internal cleansing, along with \"immune-enhancing\" regimens, represent today's reigning \"alternatives.\" Such approaches reflect underlying social trends and values, such as belief in assuming personal responsibility for one's health, the importance of self care and physical fitness, patients' rights movements, dietary emphases encouraged by conventional and alternative medicine alike, the holistic medicine movement, and general disaffection with organized medicine. Just as questionable therapies are born of the values and beliefs of their culture, so these treatments and their use affect the social environment in which they exist. The relationship is reciprocal and cyclic, with social trends encouraging particular forms of questionable regimens and these regimens, in turn, reinforcing prevailing social beliefs. Public beliefs about cancer were reflected in responses to our studies of unorthodox cancer therapies and of psychosocial correlates of survival. Responses revealed widely held values and beliefs about cancer, cancer treatment, and medicine generally. These themes are described.\r"

Furthermore, genotypic studies disclosed a clonal rearrangement of the beta T-cell receptor gene. It is concluded that this case of LG is related to a neoplastic T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. The relations between LG and the previous AML are discussed.\r"

In eight patients (33%), histologic confirmation of low-grade astrocytoma was obtained. Patients had radiation therapy only if there was evidence of visual deterioration or other clinical or radiographic evidence of disease progression. Radiation doses ranged from 4500 to 5660 cGy (median, 5400 cGy) with up to a 17-year follow-up period (median, 6 years). The 6-year actuarial freedom from disease progression and overall 6-year survival are 88% and 100%, respectively. Visual improvement or stabilization was seen in 21 (91%) patients after radiation. A high incidence of endocrine abnormalities is reported, with 15 of the 18 patients evaluated after treatment showing growth hormone deficiency. We conclude that definitive radiation therapy is associated with tumor control in most of the patients with progressive optic chiasm gliomas. However, neuropsychiatric and endocrine abnormalities are significant problems that need additional evaluation in these children.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 31 patients with gastric cancer showing peritoneal dissemination received continuous hyperthermic peritoneal perfusion (CHPP) in combination with the administration of cisplatin (CDDP) and mitomycin C (MMC). The authors developed a new special device named the peritoneal cavity expander (PCE) for sufficient perfusion and direct temperature measurement in the peritoneal cavity. As complications of CHPP three patients presented with bone marrow suppressions (leukocytes less than or equal to 3000/mm3 and/or platelets less than or equal to 30,000/mm3): one, leakage of intestinal anastomosis; one, intestinal perforation; and one, acute renal failure. But none of them was lethal. Twelve of 31 patients who had received CHPP during the initial operation underwent second-look operation (SLO) for the assessing the effects of CHPP and for resecting residual or recurrent tumors. Among 12 patients who received SLO complete response (CR) was observed in four patients, partial response (PR) in one, no change (NC) in three, and progressive disease (PD) in four, with the overall response rates (%CR + %PR) standing at 41%. Two-year survival rate of the complete and partial responders was 50%, which was significantly higher than 0% of the other responders (NC + PD). The survival curves of the two groups were significantly different (P less than 0.05, generalized Wilcoxon test). These results supported that CHPP was well tolerated and effective for the treatment of patients with peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer when combined with anti-cancer drugs having synergism with hyperthermia. Since the outcome of SLO was one of prognostic factors it was important to follow up these patients by SLO.\r"

  ".W": "Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) is a problematic clinical arrhythmia that is usually symptomatic. Unfortunately, few adequate trials and trial methods are available for assessment of the value of therapy, and traditional treatment has often been ineffective or associated with unacceptable side effects. Transtelephonic monitoring is a new method that allows evaluation of paroxysmal arrhythmias and arrhythmia-related symptoms in outpatients. We used a patient-initiated transtelephonic monitor system to evaluate the potential of flecainide, a class 1C antiarrhythmic, in prevention of symptomatic recurrences of PAF. Sixty-four patients qualified for the study (two or more PAF attacks documented within a 4-week baseline period) and entered a dose-finding phase to determine drug tolerance. Dose was incremented at weekly intervals from 200-300 and finally to 400 mg/day. The largest dose that was well tolerated was selected for the 4-month, double-blind, randomized, crossover comparison with placebo. Fifty-five patients entered and 53 received both treatments in the double-blind phase; 48 of these patients without protocol violations were evaluable for efficacy comparisons. Evaluable patients had undergone an average of 3.8 previous drug trials (range, 1-8); 30 were men, 18 had hypertension, and 14 had ischemic heart disease. The study demonstrated a highly significant correlation (p less than 0.0001) between perceived symptoms and documented PAF by transtelephonic monitoring. The rate of symptoms and PAF attacks was also significantly reduced by therapy (median dose, 300 mg/day). The first PAF attack occurred after a median of 3 days on placebo versus 14.5 days on flecainide (p less than 0.001) therapy. Similarly, the time interval between attacks was lengthened, from a median of 6.2 days on placebo to 27.0 days on flecainide (p less than 0.001) therapy. PAF was prevented in 15 patients (31%) during flecainide and four (9%) during placebo therapy (p = 0.013). However, during the study, 13 patients dropped out, seven because of adverse effects (five cardiac), five for other reasons, and one because of cardiac arrest/death. Adverse cardiac events occurred in a total of seven patients (11%) during flecainide therapy. Thus, transtelephonic monitoring is a useful method for documentation of the occurrence of paroxysmal arrhythmias such as PAF and its related symptoms during daily living and for assessment of new therapies in an outpatient setting.\r"

Four patients, referred because of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia, were receiving class IC antiarrhythmic agents in an attempt to prevent inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia. New or worsening spontaneous arrhythmias developed while they were on flecainide acetate (n = 3) or encainide hydrochloride (n = 1) therapy. Spontaneous runs of rapid nonsustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia developed in two. Increased frequency of premature ventricular contractions and repetitive forms of ventricular ectopic activity developed in one, despite the fact that inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia had been prevented. Salvos and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia developed in the fourth patient. Propranolol had failed to prevent inducibility of sustained ventricular tachycardia during previous programmed stimulation studies in three of the four patients, but it reproducibly suppressed drug-induced arrhythmias that appeared only after administration of the IC agents in each patient. Suppression of the proarrhythmic effects by beta-adrenergic blockade suggests a possible interaction of these drugs with autonomic function in the genesis of the observed proarrhythmic effects. Direct pharmacologic control of proarrhythmic drug effects has not previously been reported.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of the synthetic 28-amino-acid alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on the proximal coronary arteries and coronary blood flow were evaluated in 17 patients. Proximal coronary dimension was quantitated by digital angiography, and coronary flow was quantitated with 3F Doppler flow catheters. ANP, when given as a 2.5-micrograms/kg bolus in the left ventricle, caused sustained significant proximal coronary dilations from 3.49 +/- 0.57 to 4.09 +/- 0.76 mm, lasting more than 30 minutes. The proximal coronary diameter did not increase further after intracoronary injection of 0.3 mg nitroglycerin (4.08 +/- 0.79 mm). Coronary flow (resistance coronary dilation) was not significantly increased at 5 minutes after ANP (87 +/- 55 to 102 +/- 54 vol flow units), indicating that the proximal coronary dilations were not flow dependent. The persistent proximal coronary dilations were associated with minor and transient decreases in aortic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and with minor and transient increases in heart rate, cardiac output, and left ventricular contractility. Plasma ANP level increased significantly by more than sixfold from 39.8 +/- 8.8 to 245.8 +/- 168.5 pg/ml. The time course of proximal coronary dilations was related more closely to the time course of increase in plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate than that of plasma ANP. This study demonstrates that bolus injection of ANP (2.5 micrograms/kg), an endogenous vasodilator, caused marked sustained preferential proximal coronary dilations and brief minor changes in cardiac and systemic hemodynamics. Although additional studies are needed to assess its clinical efficacy as a coronary dilator in the treatment of coronary artery disease, these data suggest a potential of ANP in the therapy of ischemia.\r"

As an index of platelet activation, we assessed thromboxane A2 biosynthesis during coronary thrombolysis with intravenous t-PA in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Urinary 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2, a metabolite of thromboxane A2, was increased to a peak of 3,327 +/- 511 pg/mg creatinine (n = 12) following administration of intravenous t-PA and remained elevated for 48 hours. This increase was abolished by pretreatment with aspirin 325 mg orally (n = 6), indicating de novo biosynthesis of thromboxane A2 rather than washout of preformed metabolites during reperfusion. Prostacyclin (PGI2) biosynthesis, determined by excretion of 2,3-dinor-6-keto-PGF1 alpha, also increased after t-PA administration. However, this increase was less pronounced in patients who reperfused (28 +/- 3.3 ng.hr/mg creatinine) than in patients who failed to reperfuse (118 +/- 30 ng.hr/mg creatinine, p less than 0.05). These data provide evidence of platelet activation during coronary thrombolysis with t-PA. In patients who reperfuse, the reduction in PGI2 biosynthesis may be a marker of reperfusion injury to the vasculature and may further amplify platelet activation.\r"

  ".W": "The composition of an evolving arterial thrombus may be a determinant of how effectively pharmacologic agents prevent reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis. In this study, reoccluding platelet- or fibrin-rich thrombi as delineated by scanning electron microscopy were produced selectively in the femoral arteries of dogs with the use of electrically induced vascular injury or implantation of copper wire, respectively. Initial thrombolysis after intravenous infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (1 mg/kg over 30 minutes) was less frequent in the preparation producing platelet-rich thrombi than in that producing fibrin-rich thrombi (lysis in 19 of 24 versus 18 of 18, p = 0.06). In dogs with initial arterial recanalization, intravenous infusion of arginine-glycine-aspartate-O-methyltyrosine amide (RGDY), which competes with fibrinogen for binding to platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors, prevented reocclusion caused by recurrence of platelet-rich thrombi in six of six dogs within 90 minutes; reocclusion occurred in five of seven saline-infused control dogs (p = 0.02). RGDY was only partially effective in preventing reocclusion caused by recurrence of fibrin-rich thrombi (reocclusion in three of six versus five of six controls, p = 0.54). Similar results were obtained with aspirin in both preparations. At least 98% of platelet aggregation induced ex vivo by collagen was inhibited by either RGDY or aspirin. In contrast with aspirin, however, platelet function returned to normal within 1 hour after discontinuation of RGDY. Thus, the relative proportions of platelets or fibrin incorporated into thrombi influence the efficacy of both tissue-type plasminogen activator for inducing thrombolysis and antiplatelet agents for preventing reocclusion. RGDY is a potent, short-acting inhibitor of platelet aggregation that effectively prevents reocclusion under conditions in which platelet deposition predominates.\r"

By analyzing plasma catecholamine kinetics, we tested in 11 chronically instrumented conscious dogs whether attenuations in the sympathoadrenal inhibition induced by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) contributed to this disturbance. Low-output failure was brought about by continuous ventricular pacing at 265 beats/min for 2 weeks. This resulted in a decline in aortic flow by 37 +/- 5% (SEM), an increase in peripheral vascular resistance by 48 +/- 4%, a 13 +/- 3-fold elevation in plasma ANP, a 9 +/- 3-fold elevation in plasma renin activity, and an augmentation of the norepinephrine-release rate into plasma by 132 +/- 17%. During ANP infusion, the epinephrine-release rate declined by 26 +/- 5% per 10-fold elevation in plasma ANP before pacing and by 31 +/- 7% (not significantly different) after 2 weeks of pacing. Before pacing, ANP attenuated plasma renin activity and caused hypotension without a rise in norepinephrine-release rate. After 2 weeks of pacing, ANP lowered norepinephrine release (by 16 +/- 6%) without affecting blood pressure or plasma renin activity, and vascular nonresponsiveness to ANP was verified under autonomic blockade. These data indicate that, during the development of heart failure, an inhibitory action of ANP on norepinephrine release is unmasked by an ANP-specific vascular desensitization, whereas the inhibition of epinephrine release is observed throughout. It is concluded that ANP-induced sympathoadrenal inhibition is not attenuated and, therefore, does not contribute to the disturbed regulation observed early in the development of failure.\r"

To determine if captopril can restore hemodynamic responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide infusion in rats with heart failure, studies were performed in a rat model of heart failure after coronary artery ligation. Rats with heart failure received either captopril (2 g/l drinking water) or placebo for 4 weeks and then were treated with an infusion of atrial natriuretic peptide (0.3 microgram/kg/min). Captopril treatment alone improved hemodynamics. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean aortic pressure, and mean circulatory filling pressure decreased from 22 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 1, from 106 +/- 4 to 76 +/- 3, and from 10.5 +/- 0.6 to 8.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg, respectively. Heart rate, right atrial pressure, and hematocrit were unchanged. Total blood volume decreased from 66.0 +/- 1.0 to 60.0 +/- 1.0 ml/kg; venous compliance increased from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.7 +/- 0.1 ml/kg/mm Hg.

There was no change in right atrial pressure, mean aortic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, mean circulatory filling pressure, and total blood volume. However, atrial natriuretic peptide infusion increased venous compliance from 2.1 +/- 0.1 to 2.4 +/- 0.1 ml/kg/mm Hg.

During 15 minutes of ischemia at 37 degrees C, time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased significantly and decreased rapidly during reperfusion.

Other concerns, however, documented experimentally include myocardial hemorrhage, the \"no-reflow\" phenomenon, myocardial \"stunning,\" reperfusion-induced injury, and clinically, rethrombosis that occurs at a rate of 20% and reinfarction at 8-10%. Thus, even with the ideal thrombolytic agent, adjunctive therapy to prevent rethrombosis will remain a requisite to obtaining long-term benefit. Calcium blockers in association with reperfusion have been shown experimentally to be protective, resulting in limitation of infarct size and improved ventricular function. There is no data on the role of calcium blockers in conjunction with thrombolysis in patients. Results are available from two randomized trials with the calcium blocker, diltiazem, in patients with non-Q wave infarction. In the short-term trial involving 576 patients with non-Q wave infarction, the incidence of early reinfarction was reduced by 50%, and in the long-term study (non-Q wave infarction, n = 634), reinfarction and death were reduced by 40% after 1 year and by 34% after 4.5 years. Non-Q wave infarction is believed to undergo early spontaneous reperfusion based on the following: small infarct size, contracture necrosis at postmortem, early peaking of plasma CK, coronary patency on angiography, residual ischemia, and a high incidence of reinfarction. Thus, thrombolysis occurring spontaneously or induced therapeutically is associated with a high incidence of reinfarction. The implications of these clinical studies together with the experimental data suggests that the hypothesis of a calcium blocker being important adjunctive therapy following thrombolysis is worthy of clinical evaluation.\r"

In extensive metabolizers, the drug undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to form the active metabolites O-desmethylencainide (ODE) and 3-methoxy-O-desmethylencainide (MODE). Because diltiazem is a known inhibitor of hepatic oxidative metabolism, the disposition of encainide and its metabolites was studied in eight extensive metabolizers and one poor metabolizer before and after administration of 90 mg diltiazem every 8 hours for 10 days. After diltiazem, the encainide serum AUC values increased in seven of the eight extensive metabolizers, and the percent recovery of encainide in urine increased by 69%. There were no apparent changes in the serum AUC values of the metabolites, suggesting that diltiazem may alter both the formation and the elimination clearances of the metabolites to a similar degree. In the poor metabolizer, encainide serum AUC increased 33% during treatment with diltiazem, but ODE and MODE could not be reliably quantitated. The subjects had no change in QRS, QTc, or JTc intervals after administration of diltiazem. Diltiazem inhibited the first-pass metabolism of encainide, resulting in increased bioavailability. This appeared to be caused by the inhibition of debrisoquin 4-hydroxylase and impairment of other unmeasured metabolic pathways for encainide. However, because no change occurs in the systemic exposure to the active metabolites, dosage adjustments in extensive metabolizers are probably not required for patients receiving combination encainide and diltiazem therapy.\r"

Cerebral blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained pre-ECMO, after every major change in cardiopulmonary bypass flow during ECMO, and post-ECMO. The mean pulsatility index (PI) pre-ECMO was slightly higher than after decannulation, secondary to hypocarbia pre-ECMO. The PI decreased significantly at high (61 to 120 ml/min.kg) cardiopulmonary bypass flows. This was associated with an increase in mean arterial pressure, but not with changes in Hct, PaO2, or PaCO2. A negative curvilinear relationship between the amount of cardiopulmonary bypass flow and PI was found. These data suggest an increase in cerebral blood flow velocity and vasodilation of the cerebral vessels at high cardiopulmonary bypass flows, and may explain the occurrence of intracranial hemorrhage in infants undergoing ECMO.\r"

As dextrose in the dialysate provides the osmotic gradient to achieve fluid removal, frequent exchanges with dialysate containing high dextrose is occasionally used to achieve negative balance in fluid overloaded patients. It has previously been shown that dextrose absorption from the peritoneal cavity is significant. Using indirect calorimetry and analyzing the dialysate effluent for its dextrose concentration, we studied the effects of high dextrose-containing dialysate in five patients with ARF. Despite minimal intake of calories, all patients had an RQ greater than 1.0 consistent with net lipogenesis resulting from dextrose absorbed from the peritoneal cavity. Four of five patients absorbed greater than 500 g of dextrose over 24 h. As overfeeding could lead to hepatic steatosis, increased CO2 production with worsening of respiratory failure, and hyperglycemia, the risks of using high dextrose-containing dialysate fluids should be weighed carefully against potential benefits. When nutritional support is indicated in such patients, contribution of dextrose calories from dialysate fluid should be taken into account.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma cholesterol levels, plasma lactate, and total body RQ were measured in septic patients undergoing total parenteral nutrition (TPN) with glucose, fat, and two different branch-chain amino acid admixtures (49% BCAA and 16% BCAA). Mean plasma cholesterol for all measurements (2.61 +/- 0.94 [SD] mmol/L) was lower than normal; however, it was higher with 49% BCAA than with 16% BCAA (2.94 +/- 0.95 vs. 2.27 +/- 0.81 mmol/L, p less than .001) for comparable loads of glucose, fat, and total amino acids. Plasma lactate and RQ were lower with 49% BCAA than with 16% BCAA (p less than .001 for both). Cholesterol was directly related to the absolute dose of BCAA (p less than .001), was unrelated to the dose of non-BCAA, and was inversely related to lactate (p less than .001). These results suggest that BCAA ketoacids contribute to cholesterol synthesis in sepsis, as well as being an oxidative source. The data also suggest that the reduction in alanine in BCAA-enriched amino-acid TPN assists in the lowering of plasma lactate secondary to abnormal septic glucose metabolism.\r"

After the injection of taurocholic acid, the PaO2 values decreased, the PaCO2 values increased, and abnormal shadows appeared in chest x-rays. After surfactant injection, the rabbits improved, but pulmonary edema recurred after one hour. After additional injection of the surfactant, the improved condition was sustained for 6 h. All animals in the untreated group died within 5 h and were shown to have severe pulmonary edema. Conversely, microscopic examination revealed no pulmonary edema in animals surviving 6 h after surfactant treatment. Thus, exogenous surfactant can prevent damage to the lung caused by intratracheally injected bile acid.\r"

Plasma renin activity is influenced by many factors that can stimulate or suppress its release into the circulation. Several important areas are being investigated that may provide insight into the mechanisms by which neurohormonal vasoconstrictor systems regulate tone.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and laboratory evidence indicates that the brain exerts major control on the gastrointestinal tract. Specific brain loci and circuits that send efferent viscerotropic projections to the gut have been described. A variety of aminergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters have been shown to occur along these cerebrogastrointestinal pathways and to influence motor and secretory functions of the gut. Some of the newly identified peptides have been shown to influence the development of gastroduodenal ulcers. Findings with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) indicate that this endogenous tripeptide induces a full spectrum of gut effects, prominent among which is production of gastric ulcers. By contrast, other peptides including beta-endorphin, neurotensin, and bombesin induce gut effects opposite to those of TRH, namely, inhibition of gastric acid and motility and prevention of experimental ulcers. These laboratory findings suggest that ulcer disease may represent a brain-driven event, which may be the result of a neurochemical imbalance within the brain. Further neurobiological research will generate additional data on brain-gut interactions and will probably disclose new information to explain certain functional and organic disorders of the gut.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a synthetic prostaglandin E1, enisoprost, diminished the inhibitory effects of indomethacin on mucosal bicarbonate secretion. In seven healthy subjects the proximal 4 cm of duodenum was isolated by occluding balloons. The isolated test segment was perfused with 154 mM NaCl (2 ml/min, 37 degrees C). Each subject participated in four separate tests in random order. Indomethacin, 50 mg, or placebo was given 13 and 1 hr before testing. After measuring basal bicarbonate secretion, either 100 micrograms of prostaglandin E1 or placebo (in 154 mM NaCl) was perfused into the test segment over 30 min. As anticipated, PGE1 significantly increased duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion, and indomethacin decreased resting bicarbonate secretion. Indomethacin pretreatment significantly enhanced (P less than 0.03) the mucosa's response to PGE1 compared to PGE1 alone. These results further support the observations that endogenous prostaglandins, in part, regulate human proximal duodenal bicarbonate secretion. Furthermore, suppression of endogenous prostaglandin generation results in an increased sensitivity of the duodenal mucosa to PGE1.\r"

  ".U": "90091940\r", 
  ".W": "The placenta is the source of many hypothalamic peptides. We now report that GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) mRNA was detectable in rat placenta. On Northern blot hybridization analysis, the size of the placental GHRH transcript was the same with the putative GHRH precursor mRNA. On in situ hybridization, the cells expressing the GHRH mRNA had the morphological characteristics of cytotrophoblasts. In addition, immunoreactive (IR) postranslational products of GHRH were present in rat placental extracts and in the effluent of in vitro perifused placentae. On gel filtration chromatography, the bulk of IR-GHRH present in placental extracts and perifusion effluent had the same size as the authentic hypothalamic GHRH (5.2K). A higher mol wt form of IR-GHRH of about 10K was also present and may represent the pro-GHRH predicted from the sequence of the GHRH cDNA. The mean basal release of IR-GHRH in the perifusion effluent from full thickness rat placental fragments was 337.3 +/- 38.5 (+/- SE; n = 48) pg/10 min fraction.g tissue. Depolarization by 56 mM KCl increased the concentration of the secreted immunoreactive peptide to 632.2 +/- 50.5. A 10-min exposure to 8-bromo-cAMP caused an immediate, monophasic, and dose-dependent increase in IR-GHRH secretion, which lasted between 20-30 min. The ensuing response to a KCl pulse was similar in size and pattern to that in the control channels. In contrast, a 10-min pulse of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (a protein kinase-C-irreversible activator) induced a gradual, prolonged, and dose-dependent increase in basal GHRH secretion which lasted for at least 4 h. Additionally, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate enhanced KCl-induced GHRH secretion. In conclusion, our data suggest that the GHRH gene is expressed in the rat placenta. The placental GHRH transcript and its peptide products appear to have the same size as their hypothalamic counterparts, while the site of its placental GHRH synthesis is the cytotrophoblast. Finally, the secretion of placental GHRH seems to be regulated by both the adenyl cyclase and the protein kinase-C pathways.\r"

In estrogen-primed ovariectomized immature rats, triamcinolone acetonide and deoxycorticosterone (1 mg/kg BW) caused a surge in both serum LH and FSH levels. Dexamethasone treatment (0.05 mg/kg BW) resulted in a highly significant selective release of FSH. Cortisol (1 mg/kg BW) suppressed serum FSH levels. A systematic dose-response study showed that triamcinolone acetonide significantly released LH and FSH and suppressed PRL at all doses tested (range, 0.25-4 mg/kg BW). Deoxycorticosterone was not as potent as triamcinolone acetonide and only doses greater than 0.8-1 mg/kg BW significantly released LH and FSH. Dexamethasone selectively released FSH at low doses (0.01, 0.02, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg BW) and inhibited LH at higher doses (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg BW). A single low dose of dexamethasone (0.02 mg/kg BW) was found to significantly release LH. With respect to PRL secretion, a biphasic effect of dexamethasone was observed in that the lowest dose (0.01 mg/kg BW) stimulated PRL release while the highest dose (1.0 mg/kg BW) significantly inhibited PRL release. Triamicolone acetonide and deoxycorticosterone were found to require estrogen priming for their effects on gonadotropin secretion. The findings in this study raise the possibility that the beneficial effects seen with corticosteroids in inducing ovulation in polycystic ovarian syndrome may be due, in part, to their direct effects upon the release of gonadotropins.\r"

  ".W": "Both insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-II have been shown to promote granulosa cell differentiation and proliferation. While both type I and type II IGF receptors have been observed in rat granulosa cells, the identity of the IGF receptor type(s) mediating IGF hormonal action remains uncertain. Whereas the role of the rat type I IGF receptor cannot be completely evaluated at this time due to the lack of specific reagents, the availability of antibodies specific for the rat type II IGF receptor (R-II-PAB1) has made studies of this receptor type possible. To validate the utility of the R-II-PAB1 antiserum at the level of the rat granulosa cell, its ability to immunoneutralize the granulosa cell type II IGF receptor was examined. Significantly, R-II-PAB1 (10-100 micrograms/ml) proved a potent inhibitor of [125I]IGF-II (but not [125I]IGF-I) binding to granulosa cell membrane preparations. Substantial, albeit finite, R-II-PAB1-mediated inhibition of the cross-linking of [125I]IGF-II was also observed. Moreover, R-II-PAB1 proved highly potent in immunoprecipitating the rat granulosa cell type II IGF receptor. In light of these observations, we have proceeded to use R-II-PAB1 to assess the functional role of the rat granulosa cell type II IGF receptor in IGF-I and IGF-II hormonal action. To this end, FSH (20 ng/ml)-primed granulosa cells were cultured for 72 h in the absence or presence of IGF-I or IGF-II (50 ng/ml) with or without increasing (receptor-active) concentrations of R-II-PAB1 (10-100 micrograms/ml). Control incubations were carried out with an ammonium sulfate precipitate of nonimmune rabbit serum dialyzed against PBS. Significantly, both R-II-PAB1 and nonimmune rabbit serum were without effect on the cytodifferentiative action of either IGF-I or IGF-II. Subject to limitations inherent to the immunoneutralizing potency of R-II-PAB1, these findings are in keeping with the notion that (inasmuch as the conventional cytodifferentiative process is concerned) the granulosa cell type II IGF receptor does not appear to participate in transmembrane IGF signalling. By inference, these findings also suggest that IGF-I and IGF-II hormonal action at the level of the granulosa cell may be exerted largely, if not exclusively, via the type I IGF receptor. Thus, the potential relevance and the functional role(s), if any, of the granulosa cell type II IGF receptor remain to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on phosphoinositide hydrolysis and insulin secretion in isolated perifused rat islets. Rats were infused for 44 h with 40% dextrose in order to raise and maintain the plasma glucose concentration at 350 mg/dl. Control animals were infused with equiosmolar amounts of mannitol. In vivo insulin secretion and rats of glucose disposal were monitored throughout the study. At the end of the infusion, islets were collagenase isolated, and phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis (assessed by measuring the increment in [3H]inositol efflux as well as labeled inositol phosphates) and insulin output in response to a 20-mM glucose challenge were quantitated. Plasma insulin concentration and in vivo glucose disposal rates decreased significantly, by 47% and 35% respectively, after 6-8 h of hyperglycemia. In islets perifused immediately after isolation, prior in vivo hyperglycemia markedly altered the pattern of insulin output in response to 20-mM glucose challenge. Compared to mannitol infusion, 20 mM glucose stimulation resulted in an exaggerated first phase insulin secretory response (1121 +/- 88 vs. 467 +/- 75 pg/islets.min) and a blunted second phase insulin secretory response (392 +/- 90 vs. 1249 +/- 205 pg/islet.min). In islets prelabeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol for 2 h, PI hydrolysis, particularly [3H]inositol efflux in response to glucose stimulation was also reduced (0.28 +/- 0.03%/min) compared to that in mannitol-infused animals (0.53 +/- 0.08%/min). Two hours of preincubation in a low glucose medium (2.75 mM) were able to completely reverse the islet defect in both PI hydrolysis and insulin secretion. Our results demonstrate that chronic in vivo hyperglycemia impairs PI hydrolysis in perifused rat islets and suggest that this defect accounts in part for the abnormal pattern of glucose-induced insulin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) are not only immunoregulatory polypeptides, but may have endocrine functions. We have studied the direct effects of recombinant and purified TNF and IL-1 on renin secretion using both static incubations and perifusions of rat renal cortical slices. Ultrapure human IL-1 (hIL-1) at concentrations as low as 5 U/ml (3 X 10(-12) M) significantly stimulated renin secretion (control, 98 +/- 4%; hIL-1, 153 +/- 13%; P less than 0.01). TNF similarly induced renin release [control, 97 +/- 6%; TNF (10 U/ml), 151 +/- 13%; P less than 0.005]. TNF and recombinant human IL-1 beta (rhIL-i beta) also blocked the inhibitory actions of angiotensin-II (AII) on renin release [control, 100 +/- 3%; AII (2 X 10(-7) M), 80 +/- 5%; AII plus TNF (20 U/ml), 102 +/- 7%; AII plus rhIL beta (10 U/ml), 106 +/- 6%; both P less than 0.02 vs. AII]. A cyclooxygenase (CO) blocker, meclofenamate (M), which does not significantly alter basal renin release, attenuated the TNF- and rhIL-1 beta-induced renin secretion [TNF (20 U/ml), 132 +/- 11%; TNF plus M (5 X 10(-5) M), 100 +/- 3% (P less than 0.01); rhIL-1 beta (10 U/ml), 135 +/- 9%; rhIL-1 beta plus M, 105 +/- 10% (P less than 0.05)]. The stimulatory effects of TNF and IL-1 on renin were reversible. These results suggest that IL-1 and TNF are renin secretagogues and can also block the inhibitory actions of AII on renin. Since the effect of TNF and IL-1 on renin can be blocked by a (CO) inhibitor, the studies indicate a role of prostaglandins in their action. Therefore, locally produced TNF and IL-1 may play an important paracrine role in regulation of the renin-angiotensin system.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the role of hypothalamic somatostatin (SRIF) in regulating pituitary responsiveness to GH-releasing factor (GRF) in vitro, we reduced SRIF input to the rat anterior pituitary through the portal vessels. Three different paradigms were used as follows: 1) anterolateral hypothalamic deafferentation, 2) electrolytic lesions of the periventricular nucleus, and 3) passive immunization with SRIF antiserum. Rat CRF content in the stalk-median eminence markedly decreased to 19% and 57% of that of sham-operated controls 10 days after the deafferentation and the lesions, respectively. In contrast, rat GRF content was unchanged by either operation. SRIF content markedly decreased to 78%, 12%, and 2% of the control level 1, 3, and 10 days after deafferentation, respectively, and to 48% and 8%, 1 and 10 days after the lesions, respectively. The serum GH concentration was significantly increased 1 and 3 days after the deafferentation (P less than 0.01) and also 1 day after the lesions (P less than 0.01), followed by no increase 10 days after either operation. Anterior pituitary weight and GH content markedly decreased 3 and 10 days and 10 days after the deafferentation and the lesions, respectively. The human GRF (0.1 microM)-induced GH release response of anterior pituitaries removed from these treated rats was examined in an in vitro perifusion system. Even 1 day after these treatments, GH responsiveness was clearly attenuated by anterolateral hypothalamic differentiation (8.61 +/- 0.78 vs. 3.62 +/- 0.54 micrograms GH/h; P less than 0.01), periventricular nucleus lesions (6.52 +/- 1.07 vs. 3.20 +/- 0.53 micrograms GH/h; P less than 0.01) and passive immunization with SRIF antiserum (5.80 +/- 0.43 vs. 2.54 +/- 0.16 micrograms GH/h; P less than 0.01). This attenuated responsiveness gradually deteriorated 3 and 10 days after the surgical operations. These results indicate that SRIF neurons in the anterior periventricular nucleus play a role in maintaining the pituitary responsiveness to GRF, in addition to the original action of inhibiting GH release.\r"

  ".W": "The spontaneous dwarf rat (SDR) is an experimental model for pituitary dwarfism with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. In the pituitary of the SDR, neither GH cells nor GH protein were detected by immunological methods, but SDR pituitary has a very small amount of GH mRNA. In the present study the effects of GH-releasing factor and an analog of its second messenger, (Bu)2cAMP, on the total accumulation and secretion of GH were studied in primary cultures from SDR pituitaries. GH-releasing factor and (Bu)2cAMP increased the amount of GH mRNA, but neither accumulation nor secretion of immunoreactive GH was detected. These results suggested that the mutation is not manifest during transcription, but at a later stage. The GH gene of SDR was cloned, and its sequence was determined. A point substitution was found in the consensus sequence of the 3' splice site of the third intron. Judging from this point mutation, one would predict an abnormal splicing and a 1-base deletion in the GH mRNA. Therefore, the fragment of SDR GH cDNA in which the deletion was predicted was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. Its sequence analysis confirmed that the SDR GH mRNA had 1 base deletion which must cause a premature translational termination of GH mRNA. These results demonstrate that GH deficiency in SDR is caused by a point mutation in the GH gene producing an abnormal splicing of GH mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) in thyroid hormone regulation of TSH synthesis during hypothyroidism was studied in adult male rats that were normal (n = 10), had primary hypothyroidism with sham lesions in the hypothalamus (n = 17), and had primary hypothyroidism with PVN lesions (n = 14). Two and 4 weeks after initiation of treatment, plasma levels of thyroid hormones (TSH, corticosterone and PRL) and pituitary content of TSH beta and alpha-subunit mRNA were measured. TRH mRNA levels in the PVN were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. At 2 weeks, despite a decrease in plasma free T4 in both hypothyroid groups, plasma TSH levels increased, but to a lesser degree, in the hypothyroid PVN lesioned compared to hypothyroid sham-lesioned group (7.8 +/- 1.3 vs. 20.5 +/- 1.1 ng/dl; P less than 0.05). Similarly, at 4 weeks, the hypothyroid PVN-lesioned group demonstrated a blunted TSH response compared to the hypothyroid sham-lesioned group (6.8 +/- 0.7 vs. 24.0 +/- 1.3 ng/dl; P less than 0.05). Plasma corticosterone and PRL did not significantly differ between sham-lesioned and PVN-lesioned groups. TSH beta mRNA levels markedly increased in hypothyroid sham-lesioned rats compared to those in euthyroid controls at 2 weeks (476 +/- 21% vs. 100 +/- 39%; P less than 0.05) and 4 weeks (1680 +/- 270% vs. 100 +/- 35%; P less than 0.05). In contrast, TSH beta mRNA levels did not increase with hypothyroidism in the PVN-lesioned group compared to those in euthyroid controls at 2 weeks (140 +/- 16%, P = NS) and only partially increased at 4 weeks (507 +/- 135; P less than 0.05). alpha mRNA levels at 4 weeks markedly increased in hypothyroid sham-lesioned rats compared to those in euthyroid controls (1121 +/- 226% vs. 100 +/- 48%; P less than 0.05), but did not increase in the hypothyroid PVN-lesioned rats (61 +/- 15%; P = NS). TRH mRNA in the PVN increased in the hypothyroid sham-lesioned rats compared to those in euthyroid controls (16.6 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.2 arbitrary densitometric units; P less than 0.05), and TRH mRNA was not detectable in the PVN of hypothyroid-lesioned rats at 2 weeks. In summary, lesions in rat PVN prevented the full increase in plasma TSH, pituitary TSH beta mRNA, and alpha mRNA levels in response to hypothyroidism. Thus, factors in the PVN are important in thyroid hormone feedback regulation of both TSH synthesis and secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Thyroid hormones have been reported to increase the secretion and synthesis of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in vitro. In this study, we focused on the role of type I T4 5'-deiodinase to investigate the stimulating effects of T4 on ANP synthesis and secretion by measuring cellular content and secretion into the medium of immunoreactive rat ANP (IR-rANP) and rANP mRNA levels in cultured rat neonatal atrial myocytes. Both T3 (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and T4 (10(-8)-10(-6) M) increased cellular content and secretion into the medium of IR-rANP in a dose-dependent manner. However, these effects of T4 were completely inhibited by the addition of propylthiouracil, which selectively suppressed type I T4 5'-deiodinase activity. Methimazole, which did not alter T4 5'-deiodinase activity, had no effects on T4-induced IR-rANP increase. In the measurements of rANP mRNA levels by dot blot analysis, T3 (10(-8) and 10(-7) M) and T4 (10(-7) and 10(-6) M) increased rANP mRNA levels in the same way as they increased IR-rANP content. Although T4-increased rANP mRNA levels were also inhibited by propylthiouracil, methimazole did not alter the effect of T4. Moreover, T4-induced rANP mRNA accumulation in atrial myocytes was further stimulated by the addition of dithiothreitol, suggesting that the deiodinating activity was thiol sensitive. These data suggest that the stimulating effect of T4 on cellular IR-rANP content and rANP mRNA levels is entirely induced after it is converted to T3 by type I T4 5'-deiodinase in atrial myocytes and that T4 serves as a prohormone for T3 in synthesizing rANP.\r"

We have characterized TRH inhibition of cell proliferation by four approaches: cell number, [3H]thymidine incorporation per culture, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation per cell, and cell cycle distribution. TRH decreases GH4 cell number within 18 h of treatment, and this inhibition is maintained for up to 96 h. TRH inhibits [3H]thymidine incorporation into GH4 cell cultures as early as 12 h, and the inhibition of [3H] thymidine incorporation correlates, after a 6-h lag, with decreased GH4 cell number. TRH inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation is concentration dependent and saturable, with half-maximal inhibition (IC50) of 2 nM. TRH inhibition of [3H] thymidine incorporation is receptor number dependent up to 160,000 sites/cell, suggesting no spare receptors for TRH on GH4C1 cells. The precise action of TRH on GH4 cell proliferation was examined by flow cytometry of fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-BrdUrd- and propidium iodide-DNA stained cells. TRH inhibits the number of cells that incorporate BrdUrd and not the amount of BrdUrd incorporated per cell. Dual analysis indicates that the decreased anti-BrdUrd staining is largely restricted to cells in the early S phase. This action of TRH is prolonged (greater than 32 h) and results in a parallel increase in the number of cells in G2-M and G1. These findings indicate that TRH inhibits GH4 cell proliferation at least in part by inhibiting the number of cells entering the S phase.\r"

In cells exposed to 1-10 nM hGRF-(1-29) or -(1-44), GH release and 45Ca2+ efflux increased during the first 15 sec and reached peak values within 75 sec. At lower GRF concentrations, 45Ca2+ efflux still increased within 15 sec while GH secretion commenced 15-30 sec later. hGRF-(1-29) increased GH release and 45Ca2+ efflux also after 30 min preperifusion in a calcium-depleted medium with 0.1 mM EGTA added during the last 5 min of preperifusion. However, the magnitude of the stimulation was lower than in the presence of calcium. IBMX increased GH release and 45Ca2+ efflux within 15 sec and peak values were reached within 60 sec. (Bu)2cAMP increased GH release both in the presence and absence of extracellular calcium although the magnitude of stimulation was less in the calcium-depleted medium. Efflux of 45Ca2+ was stimulated by (Bu)2cAMP, independently of extracellular calcium. When exposed to 50 mM K+, both GH release and 45Ca2+ efflux increased within 15 sec and reached high peak values within 60 sec, an effect blocked by removal of extracellular calcium. We conclude that GRF and three other GH secretagogues, (Bu)2cAMP, IBMX, and a high extracellular K+ concentration, rapidly increase 45Ca2+ efflux. GH release and 45Ca2+ efflux appear to be tightly coupled with the calcium response perhaps slightly preceding GH release. This tight coupling strengthens the hypothesis that increased Ca2+ activity is directly involved in exocytosis. GRF and (Bu)2cAMP stimulate GH release and 45Ca2+ efflux also in a calcium-free medium, suggesting that mobilization of intracellular calcium is involved in the action of these secretagogues.\r"

The nasal region, pituitary, and brain were dissected, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, sectioned on a cryostat at 10 microns, and mounted on slides. Immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization were performed for GnRH, pro-GnRH, and pro-GnRH mRNA on nasal and brain tissues. Immunoreactive LH, FSH, and PRL were determined in developing pituitary glands. At 36 days, clusters of GnRH cells were found in the nasal region only. GnRH fibers extended into the brain, and large bundles projected laterally toward the basal hypothalamus. By day 38 GnRH cells were also localized in the olfactory region of the brain. With increasing fetal age a gradual caudal extension of GnRH cells occurred. These cells were first observed in the basal hypothalamus at 47 days. Cells containing PRL and gonadotropins (LH and FSH) were detected in the pituitary at 47 and 50 days, respectively. Low levels of pro-GnRH mRNA were present in the nasal epithelium and septum by day 38 of gestation. The levels of pro-GnRH mRNA in the nasal area and the brain remained low in the day 50 fetus, but were increased significantly by day 135. These data suggest that GnRH neurons in the primate brain originate in the nasal region. Furthermore, GnRH neurons exhibit low levels of synthetic activity at the early fetal stages, but higher synthetic activity close to term.\r"

  ".W": "A heterologous RIA for ovine inhibin was developed which was sufficiently sensitive and specific to describe the peripheral concentrations of immunoreactive inhibin (iINH) during the estrous cycle of the ewe and to examine the effects of cautery of ovarian follicles on concentrations of iINH in ovarian and jugular venous plasma. Parallel logit-log dose-response lines were observed among ovine follicular fluid, ewe plasma, and pure native ovine (31 kDa) and bovine (31 kDa) inhibin. iINH could not be detected in ovariectomized ewe plasma, and there was no apparent cross-reactivity with a variety of structurally related and unrelated hormones and peptides, except a monomeric form of the alpha-subunit of INH, iINH in follicular fluid was 10(4)-fold higher than that in ovarian venous plasma, which was 3-fold higher than that in peripheral plasma. Cautery of the follicles resulted in a 35% reduction in iINH and an 81% reduction in estrogen concentrations in the ovarian vein within 10 min. During the estrous cycle, iINH and FSH were inversely related in samples taken over 30 h in the luteal phase (r = -0.69; P less than 0.001) and in the pre- and postovulatory phases (r = -0.45; P less than 0.001). iINH and LH were not related in the luteal phase, but were weakly positively correlated in the follicular phase (r = 0.31; P less than 0.01). iINH and estrogen concentrations in the follicular phase were also weakly correlated (r = 0.30; P less than 0.001). Furthermore, iINH concentrations rose in the follicular phase and decreased within 3-6 h of the preovulatory surges of LH and FSH, reaching a nadir around the time of the second rise in FSH 24-48 h later. It is concluded that 1) large antral follicles are a major source of peripheral iINH during the ovine estrous cycle; 2) iINH levels increase in the follicular phase with the growth of the dominant follicle and may be inhibited by the preovulatory surge of gonadotropin; 3) the fall in inhibin after the LH surge may be responsible for the second rise in FSH; and 4) the inverse relationship between FSH and iINH is consistent with the hypothesis that inhibin is involved in the feedback regulation of FSH.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetes mellitus in the rat is associated with loss of pulsatile GH secretion. An interplay between hypothalamic GH-releasing factor (GRF) and inhibitory factor [somatostatin (SRIF)] secretion is thought to account for episodic pituitary GH release. An increase in SRIF tone/action or a decrease in GRF release/response in diabetic rats could account for the suppressed GH levels. Pituitaries from streptozotocin-diabetic rats contained less GH than controls (15.9 +/- 2.5 vs. 29.5 +/- 4.6 micrograms/mg; P less than 0.05) despite normal somatotrope representation, as demonstrated using immunofluorescence studies. Basal GH secretion from monolayer culture of dispersed anterior pituitary (AP) cells from diabetic rats was proportionately decreased (150 +/- 10 vs. 103 +/- 10 ng/10(5) cells; P less than 0.005). GRF (10(-11)-10(-8) M)-induced release of GH from AP cells was decreased in diabetic rats (maximum response to 10(-8) M GRF, 401 +/- 60 vs. 618 +/- 41 ng/10(5) cells; P less than 0.01); however, sensitivity to GRF was unchanged (EC50, 79 +/- 41 vs. 128 +/- 67 pM). By contrast, SRIF (10(-7)-10(-10)-induced inhibition of GRF (10(-8) M)-mediated GH release was impaired in AP cells of diabetic rats compared to that in controls (IC50, 112 +/- 33 vs. 55 +/- 31 pM; P less than 0.05) associated with a decrease in AP plasma membrane SRIF receptor concentration (63.4 +/- 15.6 vs. 160.3 +/- 13.7 fmol/mg protein; P less than 0.05), with no change in affinity. These findings are consistent with chronic exposure to increased hypothalamic SRIF influence. GH synthesis has been shown to be independent of SRIF regulation; however, insulin-like growth factor-I and GRF inhibit and stimulate GH synthesis, respectively. In diabetic rats insulin-like growth factor-I levels were decreased, appropriate to low GH status, in serum (290 +/- 66 vs. 1662 +/- 92 ng/ml; P less than 0.001) and hypothalamus (6.8 +/- 1.0 vs. 13.0 +/- 0.4 pg/mg wet wt; P less than 0.001) and, thus, did not seem to account for the low AP GH content. Hypothalamic GRF content in diabetic rats (1.11 +/- 0.10 ng/hypothalamus) did not differ from that in controls (1.16 +/- 0.17 ng/hypothalamus). GRF mRNA levels, however, were reduced by 80% in diabetic rats compared to controls. Taken together these data support a combined role for decreased hypothalamic GRF and increased SRIF in mediating alterations of GH synthesis and secretion in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the role of intracellular signals in the regulation of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) release, the effects of endothelin (ET), a putative endogenous agonist for voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels on basal and atrial stretch-stimulated ANP release as well as on hemodynamic parameters (perfusion pressure, heart rate, contractile force) in isolated perfused rat hearts were studied. Infusion of ET (0.9 x 10(-9)-2.3 x 10(-9) M) alone for 30 min caused a dose-dependent sustained increase in the perfusate immunoreactive ANP (IR-ANP) concentration and coronary vasoconstriction. An initial inotropic response with a later decrease in the contractile force in response to ET was observed, while heart rate remained unchanged. A phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), known to stimulate protein kinase-C activity, at a dose of 4.6 x 10(-8) M caused a gradual, slowly progressive increase in perfusate IR-ANP levels and a more rapid increase in perfusion pressure. ET, when infused in combination with TPA, enhanced IR-ANP secretion induced by the phorbol ester. When hearts from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were examined, the vasoconstrictor response to infusion of ET was greater than that in the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Infusion of eguipressor doses of ET increased the release of IR-ANP in WKY rats, but had no effect on perfusate IR-ANP levels in SHR. To examine effects of ET on stretch-stimulated ANP release, the modified perfused rat heart preparation that enabled the stepwise distension of the right atrium was used. The increase in right atrial pressure (2.65 +/- 0.13 mm Hg) was accompanied by an increase in the perfusate IR-ANP concentration (from 8.3 +/- 1.1 to 13.9 +/- 2.0 ng/5 min; P less than 0.05; n = 15). The increase in right atrial pressure during the ET infusions resulted in a significantly greater increase in the perfusate IR-ANP concentration than vehicle alone. The calculated ANP increase corresponding to the 2-mm Hg increase in the right atrial pressure was 1.52-fold in the control group and 1.74-fold when 1.9 x 10(-9) M ET was infused (P less than 0.05). This study shows that ET stimulates both basal and atrial stretch-stimulated ANP secretion from the isolated perfused heart and suggests that ET is involved in the regulation of stretch-induced ANP release. The results further confirm the potent vasoconstrictor and cardiac effects of ET.\r"

The sustained oversecretion of hGH stimulated body growth. The pituitary glands of 6-month-old transgenic mice were significantly decreased in weight and showed marked morphological changes in somatotrophs, lactotrophs, corticotrophs, and gonadotrophs. GH-immunoreactive cells were greatly reduced in size and midly decreased in number; by electron microscopy, the organelles implicated in hormone synthesis were inconspicuous in this cell type. Transgenic males were hypoprolactinemic, presumably due to lactogenic activity of hGH in rodents. Their pituitaries displayed few and slender PRL-immunoreactive cells; ultrastructurally, they belonged to immature (type II) lactotrophs. However, in females, PRL-containing cells showed no change in number, size, or distribution compared to controls. Prior biochemical studies demonstrated high blood levels of LH in males. Their pituitaries contained highly active gonadotrophs resembling gonadectomy cells, consistent with the view that these changes are related to PRL-like activity of hGH in mice. In both sexes, stimulated corticotrophs were present. The results indicate that some changes in adenohypophysial cells of mice transgenic for hGH can be attributed to protracted overproduction of the heterologous GH, whereas others can be explained by lactotrophic activity of hGH in mice. The divergent morphological responses of lactotrophs and gonadotrophs in the two sexes may reflect differences in the hormonal regulatory mechanisms between male and female mice.\r"

Hypophysectomized orchidectomized hamsters (hosts) each received an allograft of a 7-week-old male hamster pituitary gland beneath their right renal capsule. Starting 6 days after transplantation, hosts were injected sc, twice daily with 1 micrograms LHRH or vehicle for 16 days. Twelve hosts in each group were killed by decapitation 16 h after the last injection. Allografts from six of the hamsters in each group and pituitary glands in situ from 10-week-old normal males were prepared for histological examination. Sections of tissue were stained for FSH or LH and with hematoxylin. Allografts from the remaining hamsters were homogenized to measure FSH and LH concentrations. In allografts from the vehicle-treated hosts, 22.8% of adenohypophysial cells stained for LH, while only 16.9% stained for FSH. In allografts from LHRH-treated hosts, 22.6% and 23.8% of the adenohypophyses cells stained for LH and FSH, respectively. Adenohypophyses that developed for the same length of time in situ had 24.8% and 24.1% of the cells staining for LH and FSH, respectively. Matching of some of the FSH and LH cells in serial flip-flopped sections of tissue from all hamsters revealed that many if not all gonadotrophs contained LH. LH- and FSH-containing cells in allografts were similar in size and shape, but were smaller and more circular in profile than those observed in situ. Treatment of hosts with LHRH did not alter gonadotroph size or shape, but it did reduce allograft LH concentration and elevate the serum FSH concentration compared to that in the vehicle-treated hamsters. These results suggest that in the hamster LHRH 1) plays a major role in maintaining FSH immunoreactivity in adenohypophysial tissue, 2) does not play a role in maintaining numbers of immunoreactive LH cells in adult adenohypophysial tissue, and 3) functions to maintain FSH synthesis at least in part in cells that contain LH.\r"

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) directly activates PKC in these cells. Both of these agonists stimulate prostacyclin production. Several studies have shown that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) does not interfere with the AII-induced early calcium response. We, therefore, examined the effects of ANF on PKC activity and prostacyclin production in cultured rat aortic VSMC. PKC activity was determined in the membranous and cytosolic fractions after anion exchange chromatography. ANF (10(-7) M) inhibited by 44 +/- 3% and 39 +/- 8% the increase in membranous PKC activity induced by AII and PMA, respectively. ANF (10(-7) M) inhibited PMA-stimulated prostacyclin production, whereas AII-induced prostacyclin production remained unaffected. Thus, our results suggest that some biological effects induced by ANF in VSMC are mediated by an inhibition of membranous PKC activity.\r"

In this study, we tested inhibitors of arachidonate metabolism for possible protection against the toxic effects of the cytokine combination of tumor necrosis factor (TNF, 100 U/ml) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma, 100 U/ml) in rat islet cell monolayer cultures, using a 51Cr release cytotoxicity assay to measure islet cell lysis (% 51Cr release). The toxic effect of TNF/IFN-gamma (26.6 +/- 3.7%) was inhibited partially by both a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin and a lipoxygenase inhibitor, nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), and combination of maximally effective concentrations of Indo and NDGA (30 microM) produced further protection against TNF/IFN-gamma-induced lysis (3.5 +/- 0.9%). Also, the combined cyclo/lipoxygenase inhibitors, oxyphenbutazone and eicosa 5,8,11,14 tetrynoic acid, as well as the phospholipase A2 inhibitor, bromophenacyl bromide, significantly inhibited the cytotoxic effect of TNF/IFN-gamma. Whereas indomethacin and NDGA did not prevent TNF/IFN-gamma-induced inhibition of insulin release, this recovered after cytokine removal from cultures protected by the cyclo/lipoxygenase inhibitors. These results suggest that arachidonate metabolites may be involved in mediating the cytotoxic and not the functional inhibitory effects of TNF and IFN-gamma in islet cells.\r"

The overall quality of the radiographic films received similar ratings in a blind appraisal by an outside radiologist. In contrast, the performance of sigmoidoscopy was facilitated by the more thorough bowel cleansing for same-day procedures. It is concluded that same-day sigmoidoscopy and double contrast barium enema diminishes the cost and patient discomfort for colonic investigation without impairing its quality, provided that CO2 instead of air is used during the endoscopic study.\r"

  ".U": "90093532\r", 
  ".W": "New methods of respiratory support are needed to reduce the high mortality rate of acute respiratory failure. To simplify the procedures of extracorporeal CO2 elimination under apneic oxygenation, one approach is to replace the membrane lung by a hemodialyzer and to administer an alkali, since hemodialysis requires a lower blood flow rate than blood-gas exchange. This study compared the effectiveness of trishydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM) and NaOH in this procedure. Twelve male Anglo-Poitevin dogs (25 to 33 kg) were anesthetized, curarized and mechanically hypoventilated (VE = 41% of the control value). After not less than 15 min, a venovenous shunt was used for dialysis with blood flow of 7-10 ml. min.-1kg-1 for at least 8 hours. The dialysate contained no acetate, bicarbonate or lactate, but was alkalinized to a pH of 8-9 by the addition of NaOH. A solution of THAM (0.5 N) was infused into the right heart at the rate of 0.30 ml.min.-1kg-1 in six animals, and NaOH (0.15 N) was infused in the other six at the rate of 0.80 ml.min-1kg-1. The injected volumes were compensated for by an equivalent amount of ultrafiltration. Elimination of CO2 (mean TCO2 = 2.3 ml.min.-1kg-1) was the same with both methods and the difference for the electrolytes and acid-base equilibrium was only very small. However, hemolysis was six times greater with NaOH than with THAM. Despite ultrafiltration, a similar marked weight gain was observed from the second hour of the experiment in the NaOH series, but only after 7 hours with THAM. It thus appears that hemodialysis combined with alkalinisation is still too complex a procedure to be safely applied in acute or chronic pulmonary failure.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the roles of cyclooxygenase inhibition and alveolar hypoxia in controlling the distribution of pulmonary perfusion in granulomatous lung injury, we studied 15 dogs (anesthetized and ventilated) 4 wk after intravenous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (0.5-0.75 ml/kg). Base-line hemodynamic and blood gas observations were obtained at fractional O2 concentration (FIO2) 0.21 and 0.10. Observations at each FIO2 were repeated 30 min after infusion of meclofenemate (2 mg/kg; n = 10) or saline (n = 5). Resistance to pulmonary blood flow was assessed using the difference between pulmonary arterial diastolic and left atrial pressures (PDG). Distribution of blood flow between normal and diseased regions of the lung was evaluated with measurement of inert gas shunt flow. Before infusion, there were no significant differences between the two groups at either FIO2. At FIO2 0.10 PDG rose from 3 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 3 mmHg in the saline group and from 3 +/- 1 to 8 +/- 3 mmHg in the meclofenemate group, although the shunt flow increased from 8.7 +/- 7.7 to 12.2 +/- 9.2% and from 10.7 +/- 11.0 to 17.6 +/- 18.3 in the two groups, respectively. Saline induced no significant changes at either FIO2. After meclofenemate, PDG at FIO2 0.21 rose to 7 +/- 4 mmHg (P less than 0.015) while shunt flow fell to 5.2 +/- 6.2% (P less than 0.0125), whereas at FIO2 0.10 PDG rose to 15 +/- 5 mmHg (P less than 0.001) while shunt flow rose only to 14.3 +/- 16.4% (P = NS). We propose that perivascular inflammation enhanced perfusion of abnormal lung by elaborating vasodilator prostanoids. By inhibiting prostanoid biosynthesis, meclofenemate selectively increased resistance in diseased lung at FIO2 0.21 and lowered shunt flow. The persistent rise in shunt during hypoxia after meclofenemate suggests that factors other than prostanoids may account for the apparent attenuation of hypoxic vasoconstriction in diseased lung.\r"

The slopes of the regression lines relating log EMGdi activity to minute volume of ventilation (VE) were steeper during HVR runs than HCVR runs (mean +/- SE, 0.03201 +/- 0.00724 vs. 0.02729 +/- 0.00676, P less than 0.03). Phasic expiratory EMGeo activity was seen in 15 of 15 HCVR runs but in only 6 of 15 HVR runs. Furthermore, the maximum level of VE attained before the onset of EMGeo activity was significantly lower during HCVR runs than during HVR runs (23.1 +/- 2.5 vs. 34.8 +/- 4.01/min, P less than 0.003). We conclude that in awake humans 1) the diaphragm is activated to a greater extent by hypoxia than hypercapnia at a given VE and 2) hypercapnia causes a more consistent recruitment of abdominal expiratory activity at lower VE than does hypoxia.\r"

The changes that occurred in these parameters in response to a 6-wk training program were then assessed. Obese rats were randomly assigned to a sedentary or training group. Lean littermates served as a second control. Training consisted of treadmill running at 18 m/min up an 8% grade, 1.5 h/day, 5 day/wk for 6 wk. During week 6, VO2max and R during a steady-state run (74% max) were determined. After 2 days of inactivity, hindlimb muscles were excised, stained for fiber type and capillaries, and assayed for hexokinase, citrate synthase, cytochrome oxidase, and beta-hydroxyacetyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The obese sedentary rats demonstrated greater oxidative enzyme activities per gram of muscle tissue than their lean littermates, greater R values during submaximal exercise of the same relative intensity, and greater absolute VO2max values. Training resulted in a 20-56% increase in oxidative enzymes, a 10% increase in VO2max, and an increase in capillary density in the soleus and plantaris. There was no alteration in R values during exercise at 74% VO2max or in fiber type composition in response to exercise training. Results suggest that the muscle of the obese Zucker rat manifests a greater oxidative capacity than the muscle of its lean littermates. The apparent inability of the obese rat to increase its use of fat during submaximal exercise of the same relative intensity in response to training remains to be elucidated.\r"

Unilateral topical application of NMDA (1 x 10(-8) mol) to the intermediate region of the ventrolateral medulla exaggerates the phrenic response to CO2 at end-tidal PCO2 levels of less than 50.0 Torr. At higher end-tidal PCO2 levels, however, such differences disappear. Unilateral NMDA application increases the activity of the right and left phrenic nerves equally. Furthermore, the magnitude of the phrenic response after unilateral application of NMDA was not different from that after bilateral application. NMDA also had a vasopressor action when applied to the ventrolateral medullary surface. In contrast to respiratory responses, bilateral application of NMDA caused a significant increase in blood pressure compared with unilateral application of NMDA. Application of the NMDA antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid abolished both the blood pressure and respiratory effects of NMDA. These results suggest that CO2 and NMDA may act on a common respiratory premotoneuron to produce stimulation of breathing. Because blood pressure responses, unlike respiratory responses, were greater after bilateral application than after unilateral application of NMDA, it is suggested that the neural substrates for the two effects of NMDA seem to be different.\r"

Animals in groups II-IV were infused with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 150 micrograms/kg) and resuscitated with normal saline (1.2 ml.kg-1.min-1). Animals in group I (n = 4) were resuscitated as above but were not infused with LPS. Animals in group II (n = 7) served as endotoxic controls. Pigs in groups III (n = 6) and IV (n = 5) were pre- and posttreated with ibuprofen (10 mg/kg bolus then 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 and meclofenamate (5 mg/kg then 5 mg.kg-1.h-1, respectively. Ileal intramucosal hydrogen ion concentration [( H+]) was estimated tonometrically. In group I, cardiac index (CI), mean arterial pressure (MAP), superior mesenteric arterial perfusion (QSMA), and mesenteric O2 delivery (DO2) increased significantly, but other variables were unchanged. After infusion of LPS in group II, MAP and systemic vascular resistance index were markedly diminished but CI was well preserved. In this group, QSMA, systemic DO2, and mesenteric DO2 decreased, whereas systemic O2 uptake (VO2) and gut [H+] increased; mesenteric VO2 was unchanged. Compared with pigs in group II, pigs treated with ibuprofen or meclofenamate manifested improved systemic and mesenteric DO2. In groups III and IV, QSMA remained normal, increased systemic VO2 was not observed, and gut intramucosal acidosis was ameliorated. Increased intramucosal [H+] in group II suggests that QSMA was inadequate. The salutary effects of ibuprofen and meclofenamate suggest that inadequate mesenteric perfusion was mediated, at least in part, by cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites or arachidonic acid.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of exercise intensity and duration on blood gases in thoroughbred horses were studied to characterize the apparent exercise-induced failure in pulmonary gas exchange that occurs in these animals. In response to 2 min of exercise, arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) decreased in mild and moderate exercise, returned to normocapnic levels in moderate to heavy exercise, and rose 5-10 Torr above resting values during very heavy exercise when CO2 production (VCO2) exceeded 20 times the resting value, and mixed venous CO2 tension approximated 140 Torr. Exercise-induced hypoxemia occurred at the onset of heavy exercise and was associated with the absence of a hyperventilatory response and an alveolar-arterial PO2 difference that increased four to six times above rest with very heavy exercise. PaCO2 was related to VCO2 but not fb, as changes in breathing frequency (fb) of 8-20 breaths/min at comparable VCO2 did not affect PaCO2. Prolonging very heavy exercise from 2 to 4 min caused a severe metabolic acidosis (arterial pH less than 7.15) and hypoxemia was maintained; however, CO2 was no longer retained, as PaCO2 gradually fell to below resting levels, due to an increased tidal volume at constant fb. We conclude that a truly compensatory hyperventilation to very heavy exercise in the horse is not achieved because of the excessive volumes and flow rates required by their extraordinarily high VCO2 and VO2. On the other hand, the frank CO2 retention during short-term high-intensity exercise occurs even though the horse is not apparently mechanically obligated to tolerate it.\r"

HAPE-S were five males with a history of HAPE. Five healthy volunteers who had repeated experiences of mountain climbing without any history of altitude-related problems served as controls. HAPE-S showed much greater increase in pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) than the control subjects, resulting in a much higher level of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa), under both acute hypoxia of 15% O2 (Ppa = 29.0 +/- 2.8 vs. 17.8 +/- 0.3 Torr, P less than 0.05) and acute hypobaria of 515 Torr (32.3 +/- 2.8 vs. 19.1 +/- 0.8 Torr, P less than 0.05). Also, PVRI in HAPE-S exhibited a tendency to increase even during light exercise with supine bicycle ergometer (50 W), whereas PVRI in the control subjects significantly decreased, so that HAPE-S showed a greater increase in Ppa (delta Ppa = 16.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.9 +/- 1.1 Torr, P less than 0.001) and a greater decrease in arterial oxygen tension (17.8 +/- 4.7 vs. 5.6 +/- 1.7 Torr, P less than 0.05). We thus conclude that HAPE-S have a constitutional abnormality, which can be evaluated at low altitude, in the pulmonary circulatory responses to possible causative factors of HAPE such as hypoxia, hypobaria, and exercise.\r"

  ".W": "Permeability coefficients of human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers cultured on polycarbonate filters were determined by monitoring transendothelial albumin transport. Permeability was determined as a function of time in culture and in the presence of vasoactive agonists. Permeability decreased with increasing time in culture. All agonist experiments were performed with 15-day cultures because this time point best modeled the in vivo permeability barrier function. Permeability of endothelial monolayers decreased significantly in the presence of the stable prostacyclin analogue iloprost (6 nM), dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP, 0.5 mM)-3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, 0.1 mM), 8-bromo cAMP (0.5 mM)-IBMX, dibutyryl cAMP-theophylline (0.5 mM), or IBMX. A 9.6-fold increase in permeability resulting from thrombin [0.15 U/ml (1 nM)] treatment was inhibited by pretreating the monolayers with dibutyryl cAMP-IBMX, 8-bromo cAMP-IBMX, dibutyryl cAMP-theophylline, dibutyryl cAMP, IBMX, iloprost, or D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2-alpha-thrombin (1 nM). The thrombin-induced permeability increase was not significantly altered by pretreating monolayers with aspirin (5 microM) or indomethacin (50 microM). Inactivated forms of thrombin, diisopropylflurophosphate-alpha-thrombin (1 nM) and D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2-alpha-thrombin, did not significantly affect permeability. Monolayer permeability was not altered in response to bradykinin (1 microM). These results suggest a mediating role for intracellular cAMP in the permeability barrier function of endothelial monolayers.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ovariectomy on metabolism of high-energy phosphate compounds during and after exercise were studied in hindleg muscles of 14 rats. Sciatic nerve stimulation was used to establish different work loads, and the changes in inorganic phosphate-to-phosphocreatine ratios (Pi/PCr) were recorded by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in vivo. Four weeks after ovariectomy, there was evidence of significantly higher Pi/PCr during work at stimulation rates greater than 0.5 Hz. The slope for the stimulation rate-to-Pi/PCr relationship decreased from 1.98 +/- 0.15 to 1.36 +/- 0.2 Hz/Pi/PCr after ovariectomy. The normalized tension output of these muscles, tested separately using identical stimulation protocols, was not changed with ovariectomy. Thus the relationship between work (tension-time integral) and bioenergetic cost (Pi/PCr) suggested reduced maximal enzyme activity (Vmax) by 9-17% as a result of lack of ovarian sex hormones, but no change in Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was found. Postexercise recovery was also significantly slower (3.27 +/- 0.54 PCr/Pi units per minute compared with 4.04 +/- 1.08 in controls). It is suggested that reduced levels of ovarian sex hormones decrease oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome oxidase activity was reduced in these muscles by 40%, but other mitochondrial enzyme systems may be affected as well. The possible significance of these data is the implication of a reduced capacity for menopausal women or amenorrheic female athletes to perform prolonged intensive exercise.\r"

Subjects breathed quietly or rebreathed from a bag containing 8% CO2 in O2 in both supine and upright postures. Respiration was monitored by means of flow, volume, and separate rib cage and abdominal volumes. Onset of EMG activity in each breath was found near the beginning of inspiration in the uppermost intercostal spaces but progressively later in inspiration in lower spaces, indicating that activity spreads downward across the rib cage through inspiration. At higher ventilation stimulated by CO2, activity spread further and faster downward. In voluntary deep breathing, external intercostal muscles tended to be recruited earlier in inspiration than in CO2-stimulated breathing. The change from supine to sitting resulted in small and inconsistent changes. There was no lung volume or rib cage volume threshold for appearance of EMG activity in any of the spaces.\r"

  ".U": "90094137\r", 
  ".W": "The sympathetic response to hypoxia depends on the interaction between chemoreceptor stimulation (CRS) and the associated hyperventilation. We studied this interaction by measuring sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to muscle in 13 normal subjects, while breathing room air, 14% O2, 10% O2, and 10% O2 with added CO2 to maintain isocapnia. Minute ventilation (VE) and blood pressure (BP) increased significantly more during isocapnic hypoxia (IHO) than hypocapnic hypoxia (HHO). In contrast, SNA increased more during HHO [40 +/- 10% (SE)] than during IHO (25 +/- 19%, P less than 0.05). To determine the reason for the lesser increase in SNA with IHO, 11 subjects underwent voluntary apnea during HHO and IHO. Apnea potentiated the SNA responses to IHO more than to HHO. SNA responses to IHO were 17 +/- 7% during breathing and 173 +/- 47% during apnea whereas SNA responses to HHO were 35 +/- 8% during breathing and 126 +/- 28% during apnea. During ventilation, the sympathoexcitation of IHO (compared with HHO) is suppressed, possibly for two reasons: 1) because of the inhibitory influence of activation of pulmonary afferents as a result of a greater increase in VE, and 2) because of the inhibitory influence of baroreceptor activation due to a greater rise in BP. Thus in humans, the ventilatory response to chemoreceptor stimulation predominates and restrains the sympathetic response. The SNA response to chemoreceptor stimulation represents the net effect of the excitatory influence of the chemoreflex and the inhibitory influence of pulmonary afferents and baroreceptor afferents.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of isocapnic hypoxia (IHO) and hyperoxic hypercapnia (HC) on sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) recorded from a peroneal nerve in 13 normal subjects. HC caused greater increases in blood pressure (BP), minute ventilation (VE), and SNA [53 +/- 14% (SE) during HC vs. 21 +/- 7% during IHO; P less than 0.05]. Even at equivalent levels of VE, HC still elicited greater SNA than IHO. However, apnea during HC caused a lesser (P less than 0.05) increase in SNA (91 +/- 26% compared with apnea on room air) than apnea during IHO (173 +/- 50%). Hypercapnic hypoxia resulted in a greater absolute increase in VE (23.6 +/- 2.8 l/min) than the additive increases due to HC alone plus IHO alone (18.0 +/- 1.8 l/min, P less than 0.05). SNA also increased synergistically by 108 +/- 23% with the combined stimulus compared with the additive effect of HC alone plus IHO alone (68 +/- 19%; P less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) HC causes greater increases in VE and SNA than does hypoxia; 2) for the same increase in VE, hypercapnia still causes a greater increase in SNA than hypoxia; however, during apnea, hypoxia causes a much greater increase in SNA than hypercapnia; 3) the inhibitory influence of ventilation on SNA is greater during hypoxia (i.e., predominantly peripheral chemoreceptor stimulation) than hypercapnia (i.e., predominantly central chemoreceptor stimulation); and 4) combined hypoxia and hypercapnia have a synergistic effect on SNA as well as on VE.\r"

Direct assessment of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase (cytochrome a-a3) oxidation/reduction (O/R) state should provide an unequivocal answer for this issue. A new near-infrared spectrophotometric method was used to measure the O/R state of cytochrome a-a3 of dog gastrocnemius-plantaris muscle in situ during repetitive isotonic twitch and tetanic contractions. Three contraction frequencies were used for each contraction type in alternating sequence to provide a wide range of VO2 up to VO2max. VO2 and L were measured after 3 and 9 min of a 10-min contraction period, and 15 min were allowed for recovery between contraction periods. VO2 increased with contraction frequency. L was variably increased with contraction frequency at 3 min and uptake usually occurred at 9 min, except at the highest tetanic frequency. The O/R span of cytochrome a-a3 was determined by respiring the animals with 100% N2 to determine the most reduced state. This was followed by respiration with 100% O2, which gave the most oxidized state transiently during recovery. Within this span in muscles at rest, cytochrome a-a3 was 50-80% oxidized. During contractions of both types at all frequencies, cytochrome a-a3 always became more oxidized by an additional 10-20%. These findings should put to rest any arguments that inadequate O2 is a determinant of VO2max or L under the conditions of these experiments: repetitive contractions with free flow in self-perfused muscles and normoxia.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study was undertaken to determine the change in coagulation factors in patients undergoing tangential excisions of burn wounds when red blood cells preserved with ADSOL (adenine, dextrose, saline, and mannitol) and crystalloid solution were used for volume replacement. Nine patients with burns were studied, three on two separate occasions. No patient had a history of a bleeding disorder or had taken aspirin within 10 days of surgery. Results of preoperative coagulation studies were all within normal limits. The initial levels of coagulation factor and rates of removal were compared with those of 12 patients without burns who were undergoing elective surgery and who also had massive intraoperative blood loss. Coagulation factor levels measured included the platelet count, fibrinogen, factors V, VIII, and IX. These were determined before blood loss and each time loss and replacement of one third of a patient's calculated blood volume occurred during a tangential excision of a burn wound. The data showed that patients with burns have significantly higher baseline levels of platelets, fibrinogen, and factor VIII than patients without burns do. The removal rates of platelet and factor IX are significantly lower among patients with burns than among patients without burns. No patient in the study group developed a coagulopathy or received fresh frozen plasma or platelet supplementation. These findings suggest that the intraoperative blood losses that occurred during tangential excisions of burn wounds were made safe by the higher than normal preoperative levels of platelets, fibrinogen, and factor VIII and by the slow wash-out curve for platelets and factor IX. Prophylactic use of either fresh frozen plasma or platelet concentrates is not indicated unless a specific deficit or coagulopathy has been identified.\r"

Plasma LH and FSH levels were measured every 15 min for 6 h during the day and night with ultrasensitive (0.019 and 0.014 IU/L) time-resolved immunofluorometric assays. In all six hypogonadal boys the mean FSH level was above the range of the normal prepubertal boys, whereas the LH level was elevated in only one boy. All boys had LH and FSH pulses. The FSH pulse interval in the anorchid boys was shorter than that in the normal boys, but this was not observed in the other hypogonadal boys. The LH pulse interval in the anorchid and other hypogonadal boys was the same as that in the normal boys. The FSH pulse amplitudes were higher in the anorchid and other hypogonadal boys than in the normal boys, but the LH pulse amplitudes were higher only in the anorchid boys. We conclude that in prepuberty the testes have little effect on LH secretion, but that they are involved in the regulation of FSH levels. In primary testicular failure, the elevation of FSH levels is associated with an increase in FSH pulse amplitude and, in the absence of testicular steroids, possibly also with an increase in FSH pulse frequency.\r"

These children included 5 pairs of siblings and 5 individuals from 10 families, whose parents (n = 20) and brothers and sisters (n = 5) were also analyzed. Twenty-five adults, including individuals from 3 families of normal height, were studied as controls. No deletion within the hGH gene cluster was identified using a [32P]hGH cDNA clone as a probe. A compound heterozygosity for a hGH-1 deletion or a mutation have not been found. The allelic frequencies for 5 common restriction fragment length polymorphisms were similar in patients and controls. The distribution and frequency of the distinct haplotypes in the hGH gene family revealed no differences between IGHD (n = 30 chromosomes) and controls (n = 48 chromosomes). No deletion or restriction fragment length polymorphisms could be found using a hGH-releasing hormone cDNA clone as a probe in patients or controls. This large volume of data gathered from a caucasian population indicates that the great majority of patients with IGHD has no structural abnormalities of the hGH gene cluster, particularly no hGH-1 gene deletion. In addition, they have no gross deletions within the hGH-releasing hormone gene.\r"

We have investigated the effects of sodium intake, furosemide, and infusion of ANP on the urinary and metabolic (nonurinary) clearances of AVP in hydrated normal subjects. On a high sodium diet there was an increase in urine volume, sodium excretion, osmolal clearance, plasma ANP concentration, and urinary clearance and fractional excretion of AVP, with a decrease in PRA. The infusion of furosemide increased urine volume, sodium excretion, osmolal clearance, and PRA, but decreased circulating ANP levels and urinary clearance and fractional excretion of AVP. Since there was a positive correlation between circulating ANP and urinary clearance of AVP in these experiments, we infused human alpha ANP in physiological amounts and found increases in the urinary and metabolic (nonurinary) clearances of AVP. The changes in urinary clearance of AVP in all three experiments occurred even in relation to creatinine clearance. These observations demonstrate that urinary clearance of AVP does not correlate with urine volume, sodium or solute excretion, or PRA. The observations support a physiological role for ANP in modulating the renal action of AVP, probably at the level of the renal tubules, and indicate a need for caution when using plasma or urinary AVP as an indicator of AVP release from the neurohypophysis.\r"

  ".W": "It is widely accepted that chronic administration of corticoids in man inhibits the GH response to all of the stimuli tested so far. To study the action of corticoids administered acutely, several dexamethasone challenge tests were performed, after which GH levels were measured for 7 h. In eight volunteers, administration of 4 mg dexamethasone (Dex), iv, induced a clear-cut GH release compared with saline administration. The secretion followed an unusual pattern; basal GH levels (1.5 +/- 0.1 micrograms/L) started rising 2 h after Dex injection, reaching a peak of 17.5 +/- 4.4 micrograms/L after 3 or 3.5 h. Peak levels were maintained until 5 h post-Dex and decreased thereafter. Similar data were obtained when Dex was administered to five volunteers at the dose of 8 mg, orally, with a 30-min delay of the GH peak (19.6 +/- 7.9 micrograms/L). To study whether there was a cholinergic input responsible for the Dex action, another group of eight volunteers underwent three Dex tests (4 mg, iv) on three occasions, followed 90 min later by the administration of placebo (control), atropine (0.5 mg, iv), or pyridostigmine (120 mg, orally). The Dex-induced GH peak (20.8 +/- 5.2 micrograms/L) was not significantly increased by pyridostigmine (cholinergic agonist) treatment (24.2 +/- 4.0 micrograms/L). The blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine induced a delay in the Dex-induced secretory peak, which appeared at 5 h. However, the Dex-atropine GH peak (14.9 +/- 4.1 micrograms/L) was not different from the Dex-placebo one. In conclusion, Dex alone is able to induce a clear-cut GH secretion in man. The stimulus followed a peculiar time pattern, with peaks levels attained 3 h after either iv or oral administration.\r"

Optimal responses were reached at the highest concentration used (pituitary FSH, 5 mU/mL: urinary FSH, 50 mU/mL). hCG also appeared to be a potent stimulator (optimal response, 5 mU/mL). LH showed no stimulating effect, but the hormone had a potentiating effect on FSH-induced DNA synthesis. Plasma samples of five normally menstruating women obtained at different stages of the follicular phase were also added to the rat ovarian culture system. All samples stimulated DNA synthesis, but the plasma samples obtained in the late follicular phase showed stronger growth responses, reaching optimal values at lower concentrations compared to the potency of plasma obtained in the early follicular phase (10(-3)-10(-5) vs. 10(-2)-10(-3) mL, respectively). The strong bioeffect of late follicular phase plasma could partly be explained by the potentiating effects of plasma LH on FSH-induced DNA synthesis. When plasma samples of five hypergonadotropic amenorrheic women were added to the culture system, 4 stimulated DNA synthesis moderately, with an optimal growth response at plasma concentrations of 10(-4)-10(-3) mL. When 10 plasma samples of hypogonadotropic amenorrheic women were added to the culture system, 8 had no effect on DNA synthesis, and clear discrepancies were evident between the low to absent ovarian growth potential of the plasma and the practically normal immunoreactive plasma FSH measured by RIA and immunoradiometric assay. These discrepancies may be the effect of nonimmune or immune factors interfering with FSH-induced growth or the effect of molecular changes in the FSH molecule (isoforms).\r"

The aim of the study was to determine if the change in electrophoretic mobility of S-FSH after GnRH treatment was related to the basal S-FSH level, the absolute or relative increase in the S-FSH level after GnRH, or the electrophoretic mobility of S-FSH present in the basal state. A highly significant (r = 0.94; P less than 0.001) correlation was found between the relative increase in S-FSH 60 min after GnRH treatment and the decrease in electrophoretic mobility. A selective survival of different forms of FSH in the circulation is proposed as the most likely explanation for the appearance in serum of the less negatively charged forms of FSH after GnRH stimulation.\r"

However, azoospermia is achieved in only 50-70% of men treated with high dosages of T. Furthermore, the relative sensitivity of LH and FSH secretion to chronic administration of more physiological dosages of T is unclear. We determined whether a T dosage higher than those previously given would be more or less effective in suppressing spermatogenesis and whether, within the physiological range, T would exert a more selective effect on LH than on FSH secretion. After a 4- to 6-month control period, 51 normal men were randomly assigned to treatment groups (n = 9-12/group) receiving either sesame oil (1 mL) or T enanthate (25, 50, 100, or 300 mg, im) weekly for 6 months. Monthly LH and FSH levels by RIA and twice monthly sperm counts were determined. During treatment, T levels were measured daily between two weekly injections. Chronic T administration in physiological to moderately supraphysiological dosages resulted in parallel dose-dependent suppression of LH, FSH, and sperm production. T enanthate (50 mg/week) suppressed LH and FSH levels and sperm counts to 50% of those in placebo-treated men (ED50). T enanthate (300 mg/week), was no more effective than 100 mg/week in suppressing LH, FSH, and sperm production. Serum T levels in men who received 100 and 300 mg/week T enanthate were 1.5- and 3-fold higher than those in placebo-treated men, respectively. Except for mild truncal acne, weight gain, and increases in hematocrit, we detected no significant adverse health effects of chronic high dosage T administration. We conclude that 1) LH and FSH secretion are equally sensitive to the long term negative feedback effects of T administration; 2) sperm production is suppressed in parallel with the LH and FSH reductions induced by chronic T administration; and 3) even at the clearly supraphysiological dosage of 300 mg/week, T enanthate does not reliably induce azoospermia in normal men. However, there was also no evidence of a stimulatory effect of this T dosage on spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we found no evidence of major adverse health effects of T administered chronically even at the highest dosage.\r"

Angiotensin-II and -III have also been shown to modulate PRL release in vitro. The present study was designed to determine whether angiotensin modulates PRL secretion in vivo. In 36 hypertensive patients with widely varying renin levels, active renin and basal PRL levels did not correlate. In 10 normal volunteers, both a sustained infusion of angiotensin-II and a graded infusion of angiotensin-III induced a 2- to 3-fold increase in aldosterone levels, but had no effect on PRL secretion. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had no effect on PRL circadian rhythm in 10 normal subjects or on PRL concentrations in 11 patients with PRL-secreting adenomas. Cross-over administration of placebo and captopril did not affect the peak PRL level measured after TRH treatment in 10 hypertensive men (placebo, 43.1 +/- 5.4; captopril, 40.0 +/- 6.2 micrograms/L; P = NS) or the rise in PRL induced by doperidone in 6 normal women (placebo, 129.5 +/- 16.2; captopril, 150.0 +/- 35.7 micrograms/L; P = NS). Further, administration of enalapril for 30 days to 6 hypertensive patients did not alter basal PRL concentrations or the peak concentrations induced by TRH. These data indicate that in humans the circulating renin-angiotensin system does not interact with diurnal PRL release or with the response to TRH or domperidone.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the regulation of TSH secretion in nonthyroidal illness (NTI) we studied the nocturnal TSH surge in 11 healthy controls and 26 NTI patients; none of the patients was on medication known to interfere with TSH secretion. The presence of a nocturnal TSH surge was defined as a mean nighttime TSH (the mean of 5 samples taken hourly from 0000-0400 h) significantly greater than the mean daytime TSH (the mean of 5 samples taken from 1500-1900 h). A nocturnal TSH surge was present in 11 of 26 NTI patients and in 11 of 11 controls (P less than 0.01). Both the absolute (0.3 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2 mU/L; P less than 0.01) and relative (11 +/- 6% vs. 71 +/- 12%; P less than 0.001) nocturnal TSH surges were lower in NTI patients than in controls. NTI patients had lower plasma T3 (1.11 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.84 +/- 0.11 nmol/L; P less than 0.001) and higher plasma rT3 (0.81 +/- 0.24 vs. 0.23 +/- 0.01 nmol/L; P less than 0.001) concentrations than controls, but T4, FT4, and TSH values were similar in both groups. No differences were found between the 15 NTI patients without nocturnal TSH surge and the 11 patients with a nocturnal TSH surge in sex distribution, age, caloric intake, or plasma T4 and T3, but hospital mortality was slightly, although not significantly, higher in those with an absent nocturnal TSH surge. An absent nocturnal TSH surge occurred in 2 of 2 patients with a low TSH (less than 0.4 mU/L), in 11 of 20 patients with a normal TSH (0.4-4.0 mU/L), and in 2 of 4 patients with a high TSH (greater than 4.0 mU/L). Pituitary TSH responsiveness to TRH was similar in patients with or without a nocturnal TSH surge. We conclude that NTI is frequently associated with a decreased nocturnal TSH surge. This phenomenon is not related to ambient plasma T4, T3, or TSH concentrations or pituitary TSH responsiveness to TRH. A decreased nocturnal TSH surge appears to be one of the features of the sick euthyroid syndrome and is probably related to hypothalamic dysregulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the selective beta 1-adrenergic blocking agent atenolol (50 or 100 mg, orally) on spontaneous and GH-releasing hormone (GHRH)-stimulated GH release was evaluated in six GH-deficient children during long term therapy with GHRH. Nocturnal GH concentrations were determined every 20 min for 12 h under the following four conditions: 1) control, 2) atenolol administration only, 3) sc GHRH administration only, and 4) combined GHRH and atenolol administration. The mean 12-h nocturnal GH concentrations after administration of atenolol alone [2.4 +/- 0.6 microgram/L (mean +/- SEM)] or GHRH alone (2.7 +/- 1.0 micrograms/L) were indistinguishable from baseline values (2.0 +/- 0.5 microgram/L; P greater than 0.05). In contrast, the addition of atenolol to ongoing GHRH therapy caused a clear augmentation of 12-h overnight GH release compared to that during all other study periods (5.0 +/- 1.3 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). In a subset of three subjects for whom GH pulse characteristics were determined, the primary mode of the enhanced GH release was through an increase in the amplitude of serum GH pulses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic blocking compounds enhance the responsivity of the pituitary gland to agents that permit GH release by inhibiting hypothalamic somatostatin secretion or action. They suggest that atenolol may have potential as an adjunctive therapy in some children with abnormalities of GH secretion when GHRH is the primary therapeutic agent.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution and physical and biological properties of GH-releasing hormone-like immunoreactivity (GHRH-IR) in human tissues and tumors was investigated using a specific GHRH RIA, gel chromatography, immunoaffinity chromatography, and bioassay with cultured rat anterior pituitary cells. Variable concentrations of GHRH-IR, ranging from 1.4-39.0 ng/g wet wt, were found in normal liver, lung, placenta, and pancreas. In the latter tissue, however, a different chromatographic profile and a marked decrease in GHRH-IR after immunoaffinity occurred, suggesting that GHRH-IR in pancreatic extracts is not native GHRH. In all tumors examined (n = 35) GHRH-IR could be detected, and four tumors (three carcinoids and one jejunal carcinoma) contained a very high amount of GHRH-IR (greater than 1000 ng/g wet wt). Affinity chromatography of tumor extracts led to a significant loss (greater than 50%) of GHRH-IR in nine tumors. The four tumors containing large amounts of GHRH-IR were obtained from two patients with active acromegaly and two patients who had no clinical evidence of acromegaly. Using antibodies with different specificities for GHRH-(1-44) and GHRH shortened at the C-terminus, varying concentrations of GHRH-(1-44) in these tumors were found, ranging from 10-87% of the total GHRH-IR. The biological activity of GHRH in the four tumor extracts was similar to that of synthetic GHRH alone or GHRH added to control tissue subjected to extraction. These results demonstrate the presence of GHRH-IR in the majority of normal tissues and tumors, which, though they may produce large amounts of biologically active GHRH, do not always lead to acromegaly.\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect ovarian and oocyte antibodies in serum from 45 patients with premature ovarian failure (POF). Control sera were obtained from a similar group of normally cycling women without POF. A specific antibody reaction was found when POF sera were tested against human ovary (47%) or oocytes (47%). A combined total of 69% of the sera were positive for either ovary or oocytes. Fewer sera were positive for antibodies against human thyroid (18%) or human placenta (22%), and virtually no reaction with human liver (4%) was seen. LH antibodies were detected by ELISA against LH in only 3 POF sera that also contained ovarian antibodies. Therefore, gonadotropin antibodies alone do not appear to account for POF. In addition, 2 patients were treated by immunosuppression and became pregnant coincident with a decline in the serum concentration of ovarian antibodies. In summary, the results of this study are consistent with previous immunohistochemical data which indicate that ovarian and oocyte antibodies are common in patients with POF. This supports the concept that some forms of POF are associated with an autoimmune process. Furthermore, detection of ovarian and oocyte antibodies by ELISA may permit routine diagnosis of autoimmune POF and provide a basis for therapy.\r"

To help resolve this uncertainty, we characterized by two-color fluorometric analysis the Fc receptors for IgG (Fc gamma R) on human basophils. Basophil-containing mononuclear cell fractions of atopic and nonatopic adult volunteers were incubated sequentially with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated murine monoclonal IgE and biotinylated monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that bind specifically to the different Fc gamma R subtypes. Binding of biotinylated MAbs was visualized after subsequent incubation with phycoerythrin-strepavidin conjugate. Basophils did not react with a murine monomeric IgG2a, which binds specifically through its Fc to the high-affinity Fc gamma RI (CD64), or with MAbs specific for the low-affinity Fc gamma RIII (CD16). However, basophils reacted with a MAb specific for the low-affinity Fc gamma RII (CDw32). The profile of basophil Fc gamma R expression was not altered after brief IgE-mediated activation. In addition, pretreatment with gamma interferon, which induced expression of Fc gamma RI (CD64) on neutrophils, did not induce Fc gamma RI expression on basophils. These results indicate that the Fc gamma R present on basophils is exclusively of the Fc gamma RII (CDw32) subtype. The absence of the high-affinity Fc gamma RI (CD64) suggests that antigenic sensitization of basophils by monomeric IgG does not occur.\r"

Blood pressure and heart rate were recorded continuously via a chronic catheter in the carotid artery, and arterial blood samples were taken at intervals through the same catheter for determination of blood pH, pCO2, pO2 and plasma catecholamine concentrations. Both DAMGO and DPDPE increased plasma catecholamine levels and blood pressure in a dose-related manner. The slopes of the dose-response lines were parallel, but the delta compound was about 250 times less potent than DAMGO. Only the highest dose of 5 nmol of DAMGO caused a significant bradycardia, mediated by parasympathetic (vagal) activation. DAMGO and DPDPE also induced dose-dependent acidosis, with DAMGO again being much more potent than DPDPE. The effects of both DAMGO and DPDPE on plasma catecholamines, blood pressure and blood gases were antagonized by a mu-selective dose of naloxone (0.4 mg/kg i.a.). Intracerebroventricular administration of the delta-selective antagonist, ICI 174,864, only partially attenuated sympathoadrenal and blood gas responses to DAMGO or DPDPE. The pressor responses to DAMGO or DPDPE were resistant to antagonism by ICI 174,864. These results indicate that brain opioid receptors regulating autonomic outflow, cardiovascular and respiratory function are mainly of the mu type, although a delta opioid system may contribute to sympathoadrenal and respiratory effects of opioids.\r"

Regardless of whether cells were at rest, in a state of Ca++-depletion or at K+-depolarization, nicorandil rapidly and dose-dependently decreased [Ca++]i to the lower steady-state level. Nicorandil dose-dependently inhibited norepinephrine-induced Ca++ transients in physiological salt solution containing 1 mM Ca++. Nicorandil accelerated the reduction of [Ca++]i observed when the cells were exposed to Ca++-free solution. When the cells were treated with nicorandil in Ca++-free solution, Ca++ transients induced by the first application of caffeine were little affected, but those induced by subsequent repetitive caffeine applications were reduced strongly and progressively. In contrast, pretreatment with nicorandil markedly inhibited Ca++ transients induced by the first application of norepinephrine, in Ca++-free solution. These effects of nicorandil on [Ca++]i and Ca++ transients were similar to those seen with nitroglycerin. The denitrated compound of nicorandil, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)nicotinamide, had no such effect. Thus, it is apparently the nitrate moiety of the chemical structure by which nicorandil actively and strongly reduces [Ca++]i in vascular smooth muscle cells. The reduction of [Ca++]i by nicorandil may result in a decrease in Ca++ in the norepinephrine-sensitive store; hence, the reduction of [Ca++]i elevation by norepinephrine.\r"

In saturation experiments, [3H]LTD4 saturable (maximum binding = 943 +/- 39 fmol/mg of protein) binding to GPLM was significantly (P less than .01) inhibited by GppNHp (60 nM, maximum binding = 446 +/- 113 fmol/mg of protein) in a concentration-dependent manner. No significant change in the affinity (Kd = 0.29 +/- 0.02 nM vs. 0.43 +/- 0.12 nM for control and treated GPLM, respectively) for [3H]LTD4 was observed. The binding affinity for the selective LTD4 antagonist ICI 198,615 (Ki = 0.13 +/- 0.04 nM) as determined by competition against [3H]LTD4, was not changed by GppNHp. Saturation analysis of [3H]ICI 198,615 binding confirmed that GppNHp did not change the apparent affinity or site-density for this ligand. In competition experiments against [3H]-ICI 198,615, GppNHp (1 microM) caused a significant (P less than .01) rightward shift of the inhibition by agonists (94-, 50- and 8-fold shifts for LTD4, LTE4 and YM-17690, respectively). In contrast, inhibition of [3H]ICI 198,615 by four LTD4 antagonists (ICI 198,615, 4-[5-cyclopentylcarbonylamino-1-[3-cyanobenzyl] indol-3-yl-methyl]3-methoxybenzoic acid, 4-[5-cyclopentylcarbonylamino-3-chloroindol-1-y-methyl]3-met hoxybenzoic acid and FPL55712) was not affected by GppNHp.

  ".W": "Inhibition of cyclooxygenase enhances mesenteric vascular responses to periarterial (sympathetic) nerve stimulation (PNS) in 16-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), but not in 25-week-old SHR. In contrast, cyclooxygenase inhibition enhances mesenteric vascular responses to PNS similarly in 16- and 25-week-old Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats (WKY). Thus, the modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission by endogenous PGs becomes defective as SHR age, whereas in WKY this does not occur. The purpose of this study was to determine to what extent alterations in the concentrations of PGs and/or biological response to PGs contribute to this age/hypertension-related abnormality in SHR. All studies were conducted in the in situ autoperfused rat mesentery, and plasma levels of PGE2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were determined by negative-ion, chemical-ionization, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry after derivatization and clean-up of samples by two thin-layer chromatographic steps. Base-line mesenteric venous plasma levels of PGs were similar in 16-week-old SHR vs. 16-week-old WKY; however, base-line levels of PGE2 were approximately 6-fold greater than base-line levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in both strains. PNS at 7 Hz approximately doubled mesenteric venous plasma levels of PGE2 in both 16-week-old SHR and WKY, but PNS did not increase levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in either strain. Inasmuch as mesenteric venous plasma levels of PGE2 were responsive to PNS, the effect of aging on PGE2 levels was studied. In both strains, the base-line mesenteric venous plasma levels of PGE2 and the PNS-induced increase in PGE2 levels were similar in 16-week vs. 25-week-old animals. In 16-week-old SHR, infusions of PGE2, arachidonic acid and PGI2 directly into the mesenteric artery inhibited vascular responses to PNS. However, in 25-week-old SHR, even high doses of PGE2 or arachidonic acid failed to inhibit vascular responses to PNS, and the inhibitory potency of PGI2 was shifted 10-fold to the right compared to 16-week-old SHR. In contrast, PGE2 and arachidonic acid had similar effects on neurotransmission in 25-week-old WKY compared to 16-week-old WKY, and aging had a lesser effect on the inhibitory potency of PGI2 (i.e., 3-fold rightward shift of the dose-response curve). Adenosine also inhibited vascular responses to PNS; however, the inhibitory potency of adenosine was only slightly and similarly affected by aging in SHR and WKY.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The renal actions of atriopeptins (APs) 24, 21 and 28 were examined in the conscious primate, macaca fascicularis. AP-24 increased urine flow rate and sodium excretion 20- and 100-fold, respectively. The circulating form of the atriopeptins, AP-28, had similar, even slightly greater (25%) effects when compared to AP-24. AP-21 on the other hand had dramatically reduced effects, less than 20%, when compared to either AP-24 or AP-28. Infusion of AP-24 resulted in marked increases in plasma immunoreactive AP and in renal function. There were direct, significant linear relations between plasma levels and arterial pressure, heart rate, glomerular flow rate, urine flow rate, sodium and potassium excretion. However, the threshold for these effects was generally higher than expected, i.e., greater than 100 pg/ml. Interestingly, there was a 4-fold greater slope for sodium excretion when compared to other renal functions implying a distinctly different mechanism of action. Whereas, the plasma half-life of the peptide was 2 to 3 min, the biological half-life varied from 6 min for sodium excretion to 10 min for urine flow and potassium excretion. The increased slope for the relationship between sodium excretion and plasma AP concentration and the short half-life for sodium excretion indicate that the change in renal sodium handling is independent of urine flow rate and glomerular filtration rate. There is a direct and linear relationship between plasma peptides and renal function which may imply a cause and effect relationship. This extrapolation may, however, be valid only when plasma peptide levels are elevated markedly.\r"

  ".W": "The involvement of a guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) in the relaxing responses to adenosine receptor agonists was investigated in bovine coronary vessels. Ring segments of left anterior descending artery branches were suspended in organ baths for measurement of isometric tension. The adenosine analogs, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and 2-chloroadenosine (CAD) caused concentration-dependent relaxations of coronary rings contracted with KCl. The relaxing effects of NECA and CAD were antagonized by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline indicating the involvement of an adenosine receptor. In a separate series of experiments, incubation with cholera toxin inhibited the relaxing responses to NECA, CAD and isoproterenol but not those produced by sodium nitroprusside. Treatment with forskolin did not reduce the relaxing responses to NECA or CAD. N-ethylmaleimide and NaF/AlCl3 caused significant inhibition of the relaxations produced by both NECA and CAD. Incubation with pertussis toxin was without effect on relaxations induced by NECA and CAD. These results provide evidence for the involvement of G protein (possibly stimulatory G proteins) in the relaxing effects mediated by the bovine coronary artery adenosine receptor.\r"

To determine if NEP contributes to the inactivation of circulating ANP, we investigated the degradation of rat ANP (rANP, 1-28) in the vasculature. Formation of x-ANP from exogenous ANP was studied in a mesenteric arterial preparation by perfusion in a single pass system in the presence and absence of the NEP inhibitors, thiorphan or phosphoramidon. In addition, a purified membrane fraction was prepared from mesenteric arterial homogenate and compared with an equivalent renal membrane fraction. Formation of x-ANP was quantified by a specific immunoassay (ELISA). Renal and vascular membranes shared the same pH optima for x-ANP formation (pH 7.5), although x-ANP generation was considerably greater in renal vs. vascular membranes (31.6 and 0.4 nmol min-1 mg-1 of protein, respectively). Both preparations were inhibited in a similar, dose-dependent manner by phosphoramidon, thiorphan or a polyclonal antibody to NEP. In perfused mesenteric arteries, 1.6 +/- 0.8 pmol of x-ANP were generated from 1 microgram of ANP; this formation was inhibited 51% by 10 microM phosphoramidon or thiorphan. Plasma levels of x-ANP after bolus i.v. administration of rANP in rats, were inhibited (70-80%) by thiorphan at comparable doses to those used in perfused mesenteric arteries. These studies indicate that ANP is degraded in the vasculature by NEP or an \"NEP-like\" enzyme(s).\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the lung or the PMN was the source of TxA2 required to produce lung injury in this model. Prostanoid synthesis by rat lungs or PMNs was inhibited selectively by pretreatment of either rats or isolated PMNs with aspirin (100 mg/kg p.o. or 100 microM, respectively). Unbound aspirin was removed from the lungs and PMNs before use in experiments. Lungs from vehicle-pretreated rats that were perfused with PMA and untreated PMNs exhibited increases in weight, lavage fluid albumin content and TxB2 production with respect to lungs perfused with PMA but no PMNs. Increases in these markers were prevented when cyclooxygenase from either the lungs or the PMNs was inhibited. These results indicate that TxA2 is produced by both PMNs and by lung cells in this preparation, and that TxA2 production by both of these sources is required for the manifestation of edema.\r"

In contrast, none of 11 uncultured TIL samples had detectable gene rearrangements. Lack of detection in at least three of the five negative, cultured TIL samples could be explained by increased numbers of natural killer cells. We hypothesize that the oligoclonal expansion noted results from the enhanced response of immune-primed T cells to IL-2.\r"

Microcystin-LR, a cyclic heptapeptide isolated from fresh water blue-green algae, has been shown to be a potent hepatotoxin in animals and in man. Studies were performed to determine the degree of in vitro adsorption of microcystin-LR to SuperChar and to assess the efficacy of SuperChar as a therapeutic agent against microcystin-LR in vivo. Scatchard analysis of the in vitro data showed that microcystin-LR bound to SuperChar with a maximum binding capacity of 0.692 mM toxin/g SuperChar with a dissociation constant of 0.016 mM. The adsorption characteristics of microcystin-LR by SuperChar was applied successfully to the decontamination of water samples spiked with microcystin-LR. While an oral (po) dose of toxin mixed with SuperChar (0.31-0.36 g/kg) modulated the toxicity, an oral pretreatment with SuperChar did not prevent lethality induced by an oral or intraperitoneal (ip) dose of microcystin-LR in mice.\r"

Primary cultures of uroepithelial cells were initiated from normal ureteral epithelium. Adherence of uropathogenic 3H-labelled Escherichia coli to postconfluent human uroepithelial cells was directly related to the bacteria:epithelial cell ratio during incubation. Bacterial attachment was inhibited either by mannose or by urine containing anti-E. coli antibodies. Transmission electron microscopy showed that epithelial cells differentiated in vitro to resemble normal uroepithelium in vivo. Furthermore, electron microscopy showed specific adherence of bacteria to the glycocalyx of microvilli of the superficial uroepithelial cells in vitro in a manner which closely mimics the in vivo interaction. This model of bacterial adherence permits in vitro analysis of adhesin-receptor interactions between uropathogenic E. coli and a layer of viable uroepithelial cells similar to those lining the bladder.\r"

Of the 15 patients 4 suffered new areas of carcinoma in situ, including 3 who subsequently required cystectomy (2 after unsuccessful intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy and 1 with a simultaneous invasive tumor). One patient underwent transurethral resection of the prostate for carcinoma in situ of the prostatic urethra, which subsequently was shown to be limited to mucosa and not involving the deeper ducts nor the stroma. Of the remaining 11 patients 1 died of unrelated disease and 2 suffered recurrent papillary transitional cell carcinoma treated successfully with a combination of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy and resection. The other 8 patients have remained free of tumor. None of the 15 patients had metastatic cancer. We believe that these results support the durability of response after induction mitomycin C therapy. We stress the necessity for prolonged close followup to detect recurrent tumor and to avoid metastatic disease.\r"

Serum testosterone, luteinizing hormone and plasma leuprolide levels were monitored during the 24-week study period. Median interval to onset of castrate testosterone levels was 21 days and mean testosterone levels decreased to within the castrate range by week 3 of treatment. After onset of castrate levels there were no escapes (defined as 2 consecutive values of greater than 50 ng./dl.) of testosterone levels during the 24 weeks. Suppression of testosterone did not differ significantly from that observed in patients receiving the daily subcutaneous injection of leuprolide acetate in the first 24 weeks of another study. Objective response (no progression) to treatment occurred in 81% of 53 evaluable patients and adverse (related and unrelated) events were reported in 45 of the 56 patients. The response rate and incidence of adverse events in this study did not differ significantly from those occurring with the daily formulation. We conclude that the depot formulation of leuprolide is safe and effective in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer, and that the safety and efficacy of this formulation do not differ significantly from those of the daily subcutaneous formulation.\r"

From the pooled literature, we estimated the antihypertensive and total cholesterol effects of various antihypertensive regimens. For 20 years of simulated therapy from 1990 through 2010, the cost per year of life saved was projected to be $10,900 for propranolol hydrochloride; $16,400 for hydrochlorothiazide; $31,600 for nifedipine; $61,900 for prazosin hydrochloride; and $72,100 for captopril. Doubling the cholesterol effects of the agents under study did not significantly change their effectiveness because, in general, lowering diastolic blood pressure by 1 mm Hg was equivalent to lowering the cholesterol level by 6%. Although any projection requires multiple estimates, each of which may be open to debate, propranolol appears to be the preferred initial option under most of a variety of alternative assumptions.\r"

Yet, physicians' choices of drugs frequently fall short of the ideal of precise and cost-effective decision making. Evidence indicates that such decisions can be improved in a variety of ways. A number of theories and principles of communication and behavior changes can be found that underlie the success of pharmaceutical manufacturers in influencing prescribing practices. Based on this behavioral science and several field trials, it is possible to define the theory and practice of methods to improve physicians' clinical decision making to enhance the quality and cost-effectiveness of care. Some of the most important techniques of such \"academic detailing\" include (1) conducting interviews to investigate baseline knowledge and motivations for current prescribing patterns, (2) focusing programs on specific categories of physicians as well as on their opinion leaders, (3) defining clear educational and behavioral objectives, (4) establishing credibility through a respected organizational identity, referencing authoritative and unbiased sources of information, and presenting both sides of controversial issues, (5) stimulating active physician participation in educational interactions, (6) using concise graphic educational materials, (7) highlighting and repeating the essential messages, and (8) providing positive reinforcement of improved practices in follow-up visits. Used by the nonprofit sector, the above techniques have been shown to reduce inappropriate prescribing as well as unnecessary health care expenditures.\r"

In the current study, we therefore studied the relative roles of Na-K ATPase activity, tubular epithelial hyperplasia, and basal lamina alterations during in vitro modulation of proximal tubular cyst regression during serum-free organ culture of newborn CPK kidneys. Under basal in vitro conditions, regression of CPK proximal tubular cysts was demonstrated in association with progressive decreases in Na-K ATPase activity and tubular epithelial hyperplasia. The pattern of proximal tubular cyst regression was modified by: a) Na-K ATPase activity induction with triiodothyronine, which promoted proximal tubular cystogenesis; and b) Na-K ATPase activity inhibition with ouabain, which blocked the effects of T3 on the process of cyst formation. Modulation of proximal tubular cystogenesis by Na-K ATPase induction and inhibition were accomplished without significant changes in proximal tubular epithelial hyperplasia or expression of basal lamina components. We conclude that increased Na pump activity may have a significant role in proximal tubular cyst formation and progressive enlargement in the CPK mouse.\r"

The heart rate and systolic blood pressure during maximal exercise were not significantly changed from preoperative values, but the diastolic blood pressures during rest and maximal exercise were significantly increased postoperatively. Systemic arterial blood oxygen saturation increased after the modified Fontan operation, but during exercise, a mild but significant desaturation occurred (93% compared with 90%). The ventilatory equivalent for oxygen decreased toward normal during exercise. The respiratory rate and oxygen consumption during resting remained unchanged from preoperative values. For this subset of patients, these data indicate that exercise tolerance improves, cardiac output and stroke volume responses to exercise are subnormal, and ventilatory response to exercise decreases toward normal after the modified Fontan operation.\r"

Among 153 patients with this disorder, the median survival was 20.4 months (5-year survival, 19.6%). The worst outcome was associated with overt congestive heart failure (median survival, 7.7 months; 5-year survival, 2.4%). The patients with the best outcome were those who had amyloid neuropathy without associated cardiac or renal involvement (median survival, 39.7 months; 5-year survival, 31.6%). Serum protein electrophoresis and immunoelectrophoresis are the most important tests because a monoclonal protein can be detected in almost two-thirds of the patients. When screening of both serum and urine is performed, a monoclonal protein is found in 86% of patients. Such screening is helpful if primary systemic amyloidosis is to be detected and treated early.\r"

  ".W": "The development of peptide-based enteral formulas is a significant milestone in the advancement of nutritional care of the nutritionally compromised patient. Although previously limited to specific gastrointestinal mucosal diseases, the use of peptide-based formulas has been extremely useful in the critically ill patient with impaired gastrointestinal absorption associated with hypoalbuminemia resulting from hypermetabolic states. Based on previous animal studies, several investigators have noted improved nitrogen absorption, greater nitrogen utilization, higher branched chain amino acid levels, and increased insulin secretion with the use of peptide-based formulas compared with intact protein or free amino acid diets. Recent studies have indicated an improved gastrointestinal tolerance with peptide-based diets, with the rate of absorption and the degree of tolerance dependent on the presence of small molecular weight peptides. In addition, we have found that the critically ill patient suffering from severe hypoalbuminemia frequently develops a protein-losing enteropathy, which can be attenuated by the use of a peptide-based formula. Thus, peptide-based formula may attenuate albumin turnover in the intestine and thus be efficacious in patients with a protein-losing enteropathy from a variety of etiologies (table 2). We therefore recommend that enteral support with a peptide-based diet is safe and extremely useful in the catabolic, critically ill patient or in patients with significant gastrointestinal malabsorption associated with a protein-losing enteropathy. Tolerance of these formulas is dependent on the catabolic state of the patient, with more catabolic patients needing higher concentrations of nitrogen in the form of peptides and/or supplemental parenteral branched chain amino acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An international collaborative group of cancer registries and hospitals identified 114 cases of leukemia following ovarian cancer. We investigated the possible etiologic role of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other factors, using a case-control study design, with three controls matched to each case of leukemia. Chemotherapy alone was associated with a relative risk of 12 (95 percent confidence interval, 4.4 to 32), as compared with surgery alone, and patients treated with both chemotherapy and radiotherapy had a relative risk of 10 (95 percent confidence interval, 3.4 to 28). Radiotherapy alone did not produce a significant increase in risk as compared with surgery alone. The risk of leukemia was greatest four or five years after chemotherapy began, and the risk was elevated for at least eight years after the cessation of chemotherapy. The drugs cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, melphalan, thiotepa, and treosulfan were independently associated with significantly increased risks of leukemia, as was the combination of doxorubicin hydrochloride and cisplatin. Chlorambucil and melphalan were the most leukemogenic drugs, followed by thiotepa; cyclophosphamide and treosulfan were the weakest leukemogens, and the effect per gram was substantially lower at high doses than at lower doses. The extent to which the relative risks of leukemia are offset by differences in chemotherapeutic effectiveness is not known.\r"

  ".W": "Acute visceral leishmaniasis is associated with an antigen-specific immunosuppression of mononuclear cells as evidenced by defective in vitro production of interferon gamma. We evaluated treatment with recombinant human interferon gamma in combination with conventional pentavalent antimony therapy in patients with visceral leishmaniasis. Six of eight patients with visceral leishmaniasis (mean duration, 17 months) that had been unresponsive to multiple courses of pentavalent antimony responded to treatment with recombinant human interferon gamma (100 to 400 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area per day) in addition to pentavalent antimony (20 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) for 10 to 40 days. The other two patients improved initially but then relapsed and required treatment with amphotericin B. Eight of nine additional patients with previously untreated severe visceral leishmaniasis were also successfully treated with the combination of interferon gamma and pentavalent antimony. The 14 patients who responded to this regimen had marked improvement in symptoms and in measures of anemia and leukopenia, as well as weight gain, a decrease in spleen size, and an absence or reduction of leishmanias in splenic aspirates. These patients had no recurrence of illness after a mean (+/- SE) follow-up of 8 +/- 1 months. Fever was the only major side effect of interferon gamma. We conclude that the combination of interferon gamma and pentavalent antimony is effective in treating seriously ill patients with refractory or previously untreated visceral leishmaniasis.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the effects of Medicare's prospective payment system and Medicaid's preadmission regulations on long-term care, we constructed clinical profiles in 1982 and 1986 of about 500 randomly selected patients from each of three types of facilities: nursing homes with relatively high proportions of Medicare patients (high-Medicare nursing homes; n = 23), traditional nursing homes (n = 19), and home health agencies (n = 18). Data were obtained directly from the care givers on the medical problems, problems requiring skilled nursing, and functional problems of these representative patients from 12 states. For Medicare patients in high-Medicare nursing homes, the prevalence of medical problems and problems requiring skilled nursing increased substantially, whereas the prevalence of functional problems remained relatively unchanged. For example, from 1982 to 1986 there was a marked increase in the frequency of tube feedings (21 to 29 percent), oxygen use (6 to 14 percent), urinary tract infection (7 to 13 percent), and diastolic hypertension (1 to 10 percent), but not difficulty in eating (48 to 51 percent) or speaking (28 to 29 percent). In contrast, in traditional nursing homes there was an increase in the prevalence of functional disability, but virtually no change in that of problems requiring medical and skilled nursing care. In home health care the functional care needs of Medicare patients increased significantly, and there was a slight increase in the prevalence of problems requiring medical and skilled nursing care. We conclude that from 1982 to 1986 the needs of patients in long-term care increased substantially. This trend appears to result from Medicare's prospective payment system, which encourages earlier hospital discharge to long-term care settings, and from Medicaid's policy of de-institutionalization. Meeting this greater need for care will be costly. We require a better system of reimbursing for long-term care and ensuring its quality.\r"
