Conventional BP and heart rate parameters were evaluated after a 4-week placebo period and patients qualified for entry if sitting diastolic BP was between 95 and 114 mm Hg. Ambulatory BP monitoring was measured at baseline and after active treatment with both formulations. The 2 regimens induced a significant and almost identical reduction (p less than 0.001) in the mean 24-hour BP without affecting heart rate. Isradipine was more effective in patients whose clinical hypertension was confirmed by ambulatory BP monitoring (35) than in patients who remained normotensive by ambulatory BP monitoring criteria (41). The isradipine-treated ambulatory hypertensive group experienced significantly greater decreases in BP during 24-hour, work, awake and sleep periods than did the ambulatory normotensive group. These data suggest that sustained-release isradipine has a sustained antihypertensive effect throughout 24 hours comparable to that of isradipine given twice daily and may improve compliance with long-term treatment. In addition, the results confirm the usefulness of ambulatory BP monitoring in determining truly hypertensive patients likely to respond to drug administration.\r"

  ".W": "The Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial involving 27 centers and more than 100 hospitals in North America and Europe to test the 1-tailed hypothesis that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction will reduce arrhythmic death. Since April 18, 1989, the CAST is enrolling patients aged less than 80 years with greater than or equal to 6 ventricular premature complexes and left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%. Sustained ventricular tachycardia, class IV congestive heart failure or class IV angina pectoris are exclusion criteria. During a prerandomization period, antiarrhythmic drugs are titrated to suppress ventricular arrhythmias. If greater than or equal to 80% suppression is achieved during open-label titration, patients are randomized to the effective dose or to a matched placebo. If only partial suppression (1 to 79%) is achieved, patients are eligible for a substudy that randomizes them to the best dose found during open-label titration or to placebo. The only patients not randomized to treatment are those with increased arrhythmias or drug intolerance during titration. On April 18, 1989, encainide and flecainide were removed from the CAST because these drugs increased the death rate 2.5-fold. There were no imbalances in baseline risk variables between the encainide/flecainide group and the placebo group that might explain the adverse treatment effect. There was remarkable uniformity of the adverse effect across all subgroups. There were no subgroups that benefited from treatment; all were either harmed or not evaluable.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For moricizine, such trials have included comparisons with propranolol, disopyramide and quinidine. Furthermore, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study compared moricizine in postinfarction patients with encainide and flecainide. These trials show moricizine to be superior in efficacy to a beta blocker (propranolol) and disopyramide and equivalent to quinidine. Although the class IC drugs (encainide and flecainide) showed somewhat greater efficacy in the Cardiac Arrhythmic Pilot Study, they are now known to increase the risk of mortality in postinfarction patients. Moricizine was also shown to be well tolerated in these trials and associated with fewer discontinuations than propranolol, disopyramide and quinidine. Thus, moricizine is a promising new agent when profiled against other drugs frequently used for therapy of chronic ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Moricizine was studied in 908 patients with ventricular arrhythmias. A proarrhythmia occurred in 29 (3.2%). When the severity of the proarrhythmia and the type of presenting ventricular arrhythmia were correlated, no proarrhythmic events occurred in patients who presented with benign ventricular arrhythmias. Four deaths were attributed to the proarrhythmic effects of moricizine. Of these, 3 occurred in patients presenting with lethal ventricular arrhythmias. A total of 15 serious proarrhythmic events occurred, all of which resolved without lethal consequence. The overall proarrhythmia incidence in the lethal and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia categories was not different (3.2 vs 3.7%, respectively). Thus, a proarrhythmia occurred in patients with more advanced structural heart disease, and occurred almost exclusively in patients who presented with potentially lethal or lethal ventricular arrhythmia. There was no relation between the dose of moricizine and the incidence of proarrhythmic events. Of the 29 proarrhythmic events, 26 occurred within 7 days (90%) of the initiation of moricizine therapy. Thus, moricizine appears to have a low proarrhythmic potential in the populations tested, including patients presenting with lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The implications of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial on such a data base analysis are discussed.\r"

In postabsorptive volunteers (n = 6), 81.2 +/- 6.5% (mean +/- SEM) and 53.1 +/- 7.4% of infused 13C was recovered as 13CO2 when [1-13C]- or [2-13C]acetate, respectively, were infused. In one subject studied during exogenous glucose infusion at 3.5 mg.kg-1.min-1, recovery of 13CO2 was 72.7% and 38.5% from [1-13C]- and [2-13C]acetate, respectively. In dogs, [1-14C]- and [2-13C]acetate were infused simultaneously. Recovery of 14CO2 was 75.9 +/- 2.5% of infused isotope whereas recovery of 13CO2 was 40.8 +/- 1.9%. We concluded that the position of the label in acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) determines the extent to which the process of oxidation of labeled acetyl CoA is reflected in labeled carbon dioxide excretion.\r"

We used a computerized database and medical records to study the frequency, cost, and yield of these tests in 2443 infants born at the University of California, San Francisco, between 1980 and 1982. Four hundred forty-seven (18%) of the infants met standard criteria for \"nonphysiologic\" hyperbilirubinemia; the incidence varied from 9% in blacks to 31% in Asian infants. About 55% of these 447 infants received a $125 \"hyperbilirubinemia workup.\" Hospital discharge diagnoses on all 447 hyperbilirubinemic infants were reviewed. In 214 (48%), no cause of the jaundice was identified. An additional 145 (32%) had a possible cause apparent from history, physical examination, or initial hematocrit determination. The only diagnosis made as a result of routine investigations of hyperbilirubinemia was possible ABO or Rh isoimmunization in 75 infants (17%). Nonphysiologic hyperbilirubinemia may be more common than previously reported. The recommended tests are expensive and rarely lead to diagnoses other than ABO or Rh isoimmunization. Their routine use should be reevaluated.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the neuroendocrine and neural features of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, a prospectively collected group of 12 neuroblastomas (NB), 2 ganglioneuroblastomas (GNB), and 4 ganglioneuromas (GN) was probed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to neuroendocrine and neural antigens. All tumors expressed the pan-neuroendocrine markers synaptophysin and chromogranin A. They also showed extensive expression of neuronal antigens, ie, of each of the neurofilament (NF) triplet proteins and of the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) MAP2 and tau-protein. However, only in the GNBs and GNs was the pattern of NF phosphoisoforms relatively mature. In the latter tumors glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) could be demonstrated as well, suggesting the presence of nonmyelinating and myelinating Schwann cells, respectively. The glial markers did not colocalize with the neural markers. On the basis of these data, it was concluded that all peripheral neuroblastic tumors manifest molecular characteristics of neuroendocrine cells and of neurons. The latter were most developed in GNBs and GNs, in which they were accompanied by Schwann cell differentiation in a separate population of cells. The above-outlined neuronal profile of peripheral neuroblastic tumors, including NBs, distinguishes this group of tumors from the much-less neuronally differentiated primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the central nervous system.\r"

The injury incidence during games was highest at division level (18.5/1000 hours) and lowest at series level (11.9/1000 hours), whereas the distribution of the incidences during practice was reversed. The youth section (16 to 18 years) had incidences that could be compared to the highest senior level. The lower extremity was involved in 84% of the injuries, including 34% of overuse injuries. Ankle sprains were most common (36%) and equally found at all levels, whereas half of all overuse injuries were seen among division players. Contact injuries during tackling occurred most often in lower series and youths (45%). Players participating at high levels had only 30% of the injuries during tackling and 54% during running. More than half of 20 knee injuries were caused by tackling. Thirty-five percent of injured players were absent from soccer for more than 1 month; 28% had complaints 12 months after the end of the season with knee injuries the most serious. The study shows that the injury incidence, the pattern of injury, and the traumatology varied between players participating at different levels of soccer competition.\r"

The apparent effect of giving parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition depends not only on how much and how well it is given, but also on how depleted the recipient is. Thus, nutritional assessment requires close examination before proceeding to assess the efficacy and potential benefits of the remedial measures of parenteral nutrition or enteral nutrition. Although preoperative malnutrition is associated with a poor operative outcome, there appears to be no consensus as to whether perioperative nutritional support can reduce postoperative complications to the level occurring in well-nourished patients undergoing similar procedures. This is partly because reports evaluating the effect of perioperative nutritional support on postoperative outcome vary widely as to numbers of patients studied, primary diagnoses, and the duration and quality of perioperative nutritional support. In Part I, these issues are explored in patients who are undergoing operations for cancer, trauma, or burns. Enteral nutrition appears to be as effective as parenteral nutrition in improving operative outcome, as compared with ad libitum oral nutrition. Postoperative enteral nutrition and parenteral nutrition are equally effective in reducing postoperative complications.\r"

The children suffered from severe and recurrent bacterial infections, mainly of the respiratory tract. They had been treated previously with IM gammaglobulin (0.8 ml/kg/3 wk), but their serum IgG values were never higher than 100 mg/dL. We compared the data of the follow-up after 3 years of treatment with IV gammaglobulin and the follow-up after 2 years course of IM gammaglobulin. Minor adverse reactions (chills, fever, abdominal pain) were observed only in some children during the first months of therapy. These data demonstrate that the number of infections or days with fever, in bed, or in hospital dramatically decreased during IV Ig therapy, while IgG serum levels increased to approximately normal values. IV Ig is a safe and effective treatment for patients with humoral immunodeficiency.\r"

The effect of 4 degrees C ECS on the pulmonary circulation was assessed in excised canine left lower lobes. The roles of static oxygen inflation and prostacyclin infusion during ECS perfusion were also examined. The lobes were divided into five groups: time control (A), ECS with oxygen (B), ECS without oxygen (C), ECS with glycine buffer (D), and ECS with prostacyclin (E); group D was the control for E. Eurocollins solution had no effect on gas exchange but had a marked effect on the pulmonary circulation. Vascular conductance decreased from 22.6 to 18.9 mL/min/cm H2O and from 21.3 to 14.1 mL/min/cm H2O with average vascular closure increasing by 1.2 and 2.1 cm H2O in groups B and C, respectively. The decreased vascular conductance and increased vascular closure was associated with a reduction in vascular compliance from 1.63 to 1.25 mL/cm H2O. When prostacyclin was added to ECS, the reduction in vascular closure was much less and was associated with a decrease in vascular closure and no loss of vascular compliance. Eurocollins solution increases pressure cost for perfusion by causing both vascular obstruction and increased tone, especially when oxygen is not provided. This is significantly overcome by addition of prostacyclin infusion during ECS perfusion.\r"

Twenty A/J mice received either a vaccine of 1 x 10(6) irradiated C1300 tumor cells intradermally or an equivalent inoculum of C1300 that had been incubated in recombinant interferon gamma (C1300*). One week later, all animals were rechallenged with 1 x 10(6) viable C1300. Animals immunized with C1300* had a significantly delayed early tumor incidence that translated into a survival advantage for the group. At the time of tumor rechallenge, a significantly increased level of nonspecific systemic immunity was conferred by the C1300* immunization. Thus, modification of tumor with recombinant interferon gamma before introduction as a vaccine may improve that vaccine's protective capability.\r"

These metabolic abnormalities may be a direct measure of tumor metabolism, or represent alterations in the size or activity of the body cell mass, or both. To unravel this pathogenesis, we prospectively studied 68 preoperative patients with cancer about to undergo curative resection by measuring resting energy expenditure before and after tumor resection. The preoperative measured resting energy expenditure was compared with expected resting energy expenditure based on Harris-Benedict resting energy expenditure predictions: 10 patients were hypometabolic (less than 90% Harris-Benedict); 35 were normometabolic (90% to 110% Harris-Benedict); and 23 were hypermetabolic (greater than 110% Harris-Benedict). Using each patient as his or her own control, resting energy expenditure normalized or remained normal following curative resection. In contrast, after palliative resection, resting energy expenditure remained hypermetabolic or significantly increased toward hypermetabolism. Tumor induces an abnormal metabolic rate, since tumor removal results in prompt normalization of resting energy expenditure. The abnormal energy expenditure of patients with cancer cannot be solely attributed to abnormal host body composition.\r"

Patients of the 57 low-volume surgeons utilized greater hospital resources (which resulted in losses instead of profits) and had a higher mortality compared with patients of the 17 high-volume surgeons. This was due, in part, to a greater severity of illness. These findings suggest that hospital costs and perhaps outcome may be related, at the individual surgeon level, to the volume of surgical procedures performed, and that the diagnosis related group prospective payment system may provide disincentives for low-volume surgeons.\r"

The MAb inhibited the IgG-binding activity of these proteins, and thus appears to react with an epitope located at or near the RF-binding site. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western immunoblotting studies indicate that the 6B6.6 CRI is associated with kappa IIIa sub-subgroup light chains, is not related to the Wa, Po, and Bla RF cross-idiotypic specificities, and is clearly distinct from the kappa IIIb-associated CRI detected by MAb 17.109. Using an ELISA, we detected 6B6.6 CRI in 59% of 107 sera and 48% of 50 synovial fluids from patients with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the quantities of CRI-positive RF were small, and the amount of CRI-positive RF did not correlate with the amount of IgM-RF. The 6B6.6 CRI was shown to occur primarily in the IgM fraction of RA sera by both chromatographic studies and isotype-specific ELISA, although small quantities appeared to be associated with IgA and IgG in some sera. The presence of 6B6.6 CRI on both monoclonal and polyclonal RF is consistent with the view that both are derived, at least in part, from a common gene pool. However, its occurrence in relatively low levels suggests that the number of germline genes encoding for RF is large or that extensive mutation occurs in the course of RF expression in RA.\r"

However, opsonized zymosan and surface-bound IgG did not differ appreciably from soluble ligands in effecting PMN production of superoxide, release of the specific granule component lactoferrin, or total (latent plus active) collagenase release, which suggests that there is more efficient collagenase activation during PMN stimulation with surface-bound ligands. These results suggest a role for surface (cartilage)-bound IgG in the release and activation of human neutrophil collagenase in the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Both models show some points of similarity, including joint swelling, the presence of inflammatory leukocytes and the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E2, and the kinetics of cartilage proteoglycan loss. However, the assessment of the capacity of synovial lining and articular cartilage to synthesize and secrete neutral metalloproteinases reveals a difference between these models. We found that articular cartilage from the inflamed joints of rabbits with antigen-induced arthritis did not synthesize neutral metalloproteinases, although the synovial lining did. In contrast, both the synovial lining and the articular cartilage from the inflamed joints of rabbits with polycation-induced arthritis synthesized neutral metalloproteinases. These findings suggest that in inflammatory synovitis, different mechanisms can operate to produce damage to the matrix of articular cartilage.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the potential regulatory mechanisms involved in synovial cell interleukin-1 (IL-1) release, the ability of gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) to influence IL-1 release was assessed. Rat synovial cells cultured in the presence of a variety of stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), failed to release IL-1. However, pretreatment of synovial cells with gamma-IFN, followed by LPS stimulation, resulted in increased levels of intracellular IL-1 as well as release of IL-1 from the cell. The level of IL-1 release was dependent on the concentration of both gamma-IFN and LPS, and on length of exposure to the gamma-IFN. The kinetic and dose requirements for gamma-IFN-dependent IL-1 release were similar to those for Ia antigen expression, but LPS was necessary for IL-1 messenger RNA induction, intracellular IL-1 accumulation, and IL-1 release. In addition, sequential treatment, i.e., gamma-IFN followed by LPS, was essential for IL-1 induction. Substitution of phorbol ester or calcium ionophore for gamma-IFN did not result in similar IL-1 release. In addition, induction of IL-1 messenger RNA by another stimulus was not sufficient to result in IL-1 release following LPS treatment. These results suggest that release of IL-1 by rat synovial cells requires the production of a regulatory signal, which is inducible by gamma-IFN.\r"

The levels of right atrial ANP-LI were significantly higher in mitral disease than in other cardiac or noncardiac diseases. The increased ANP-LI was mainly accounted for by an increase in beta-human ANP-LI (beta-hANP-LI). Both total ANP-LI and beta-hANP-LI levels were associated with the presence of atrial fibrillation and with increased atrial pressure. Plasma beta-hANP-LI levels were also increased in mitral disease. These results suggest that human atrium with hemodynamic overloads is characterized by increased tissue levels of ANP and by a shift to the beta-hANP form.\r"

Methyldopa and hydralazine treatment reduced blood pressure (P less than .05, P less than .05, respectively); however, ventricular weight was reduced by methyldopa (P less than .05) but not by hydralazine. Plasma ANP concentration in untreated SHR was higher than that observed in Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). Methyldopa treatment decreased plasma ANP concentration, but hydralazine treatment did not. Moreover, plasma ANP concentration and ventricular weight were positively correlated in untreated and treated SHR. The left atrial ANP concentration in untreated SHR was lower than that observed in WKY. Methyldopa treatment increased left atrial ANP concentration, but hydralazine treatment did not. These results suggest that the ANP release from the left atrium is chronically stimulated in adult SHR, and that a decrease in plasma ANP concentration by methyldopa treatment is, in part, associated with the decline of ANP release from the heart due to the reductions of blood pressure and cardiac hypertrophy.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on body fluid volume regulation, we estimated the changes in intra- and extravascular fluid volume by measuring hematocrit (Hct), plasma protein concentration and water balance, and the changes in intra- and extracellular fluid volume by the electrical impedance method during intravenous infusion of ANP. We did two studies, as follows: ANP was infused into 18 patients with essential hypertension, 29 with renal parenchymal hypertension and 15 normotensives at 0.025 microgram/kg/min for 40 min. Both hypertensive groups showed greater natriuretic responses to ANP than normotensives. ANP infusion into essential hypertensive patients increased the urinary excretion of water by 125%, Na by 205%, Hct by 4.2% and plasma total protein (TP) by 5.2% (each P less than .001). In 9 patients (1 with renal hypertension and 8 normotensives) who did not show a natriuretic response (-2.1%), the infusion of ANP also significantly increased Hct (3.8%) and plasma TP (3.1%, each P less than .01). The electrical impedance method was applied to 12 subjects to simultaneously detect the intracellular (Ri) and extracellular resistivities (Re), of which reciprocals reflect the fluid volume in the extra- and intracellular spaces, respectively. ANP infusion increased Re in all subjects (3.96 +/- 0.16 [SE] v 4.03 +/- 0.16 omega.m, P less than .05), but decreased Ri in 7. Changes in urinary Na excretion correlated positively with those in both Re (r = 0.62, P less than .05) and Ri (r = 0.75, P less than .01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In the present work I focus on the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the association between high sodium intake, obesity and high blood pressure. Despite epidemiological and etiological controversies on the link between excess sodium in the diet and elevated arterial pressure, the association could be explained on the basis of three different pathophysiological mechanisms: (1) abnormal electrolyte transport across cell membranes, a defect that alters sodium/potassium exchange and also sodium/calcium exchanges, increasing the concentration of intracellular calcium ions that heightens vessel wall tension and the smooth muscle process, (2) increased sympathetic nervous system activity and (3) altered cellular sodium concentration that induces waterlogging in the peripheral arteriolar walls. These mechanisms increase peripheral resistance and enhance arterial pressure. Early epidemiological studies documented a strong association between obesity and hypertension; and a greater incidence of high blood pressure and diabetes was reported in persons with upper body obesity (high waist/hip ratio). Researchers have explained obesity-related hypertension accordingly with various mechanisms. Hyperinsulinemia and vascular resistance may trigger the metabolic and adrenergic changes described in obese hypertensive patients in several ways. Insulin may increase absorption of sodium in the diluting segment of the distal nephron with consequent water retention. Alternatively, insulin might alter sodium/potassium distribution thus causing increased vascular peripheral resistance. The increased sodium stimulates adrenergic activity. The water retention in obese subjects increases absolute volume that is predominantly redistributed in the cardiopulmonary area, leading to augmented venous return and cardiac output. These changes in association with a total peripheral resistance considered inappropriately normal, are the main hemodynamic characteristics of obesity-related hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was conducted in 15 essential hypertensives to evaluate the modifications of plasma levels of an endogenous Na/K ATPase inhibitor, blood pressure, forearm hemodynamics and plasma renin activity (PRA) elicited by an intravenous saline infusion (0.9% NaCl at the mean rate of 0.22 mL/min/kg body weight for 2 h). The response to saline was determined in the whole hypertensive population as well as in two subgroups of patients classified according to their rate of PRA suppression in response to volume expansion by comparison with normotensive controls (Normal- and Low-suppressors: N-S, L-S). Over the whole group of hypertensive patients, NaCl load provoked an increase in Na/K ATPase inhibitory activity, measured by enzyme-coupled assay, which was linearly related to PRA decline (r = 0.73) and to the increase in mean blood pressure (r = 0.57). These effects were clearly enhanced by considering L-S patients alone. Urinary Na/K ratio after saline infusion was significantly higher in L-S as result of a lesser potassium excretion in this subgroup. Our results support the hypothesis that acute volume expansion with saline causes an increase in plasma levels of an endogenous sodium pump inhibitor with hemodynamic effects and whose release is related to the individual handling of infused fluids and to the degree of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone suppression.\r"

The LMW heparin dose necessary (anti FXa-activity) for effective anticoagulation was two thirds of the standard heparin dose. Using these doses, both substances displayed identical antithrombotic effects. Complications were not seen in either group. PTT and thrombin time were only marginally effected by LMW heparin, whereas they were markedly prolonged by SH heparin. Factor VIII activity was significantly lower in the LMW heparin group as compared to the standard heparin group after 18, 24, and 30 weeks. Antithrombin III, fibrinogen, fibrin monomers, plasminogen, and alpha 2-antiplasmin were comparable in both groups. Creatinine, urea, hemoglobin, and hematocrit were also unchanged, excluding differences in dialysis efficacy or occult blood loss. Equal numbers of blood transfusions were necessary, but bleeding complications did not occur in either group. In conclusion, safe and effective dialysis can be performed using this low molecular weight heparin for anticoagulation in hemodialysis and hemofiltration. The possible benefits of LMW heparin (reduced frequency of bleeding, alleviation of hypertriglyceridemia) were not, however, apparent, possibly because of the short observation period and the low incidence of hemorrhagic complications in routine dialyses.\r"

The immunophenotype of FXIIIa positive dendritic cells was analysed with a panel of 18 monoclonal antibodies using immunoperoxidase and double immunofluorescence staining techniques. The antibody against FXIIIa detected highly dendritic dermal cells located particularly in the upper reticular and papillary dermis. Double fluorescence microscopy showed that FXIIIa positive cells were bone marrow derived (HLe-I+) and co-expressed monocyte, macrophage or antigen presenting cell markers (HLA-DR+, LFA-I+, HLA-DQ+, OKM5+, Mo I+, Mono-I+, Leu M3+). No labelling was obtained with cell markers for Langerhans cells (CDI), T lymphocytes (CD2), granulocytes (LeuMI) fibroblasts (Te7), intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I) or endothelial cells (Factor VIII related antigen). Gamma interferon induced increased expression of HLA-DR and co-expression of ICAM-I on FXIIIa+ dermal dendritic cells in normal skin in organ culture. Moreover, in benign inflammatory dermatoses such as atopic eczema and psoriasis there was an increased number of FXIIIa+, DR+, ICAM-I+ cells in the upper dermis and foci of FXIIIa+ cells in the epidermis closely associated with lymphocytes. FXIIIa positive cells in human skin represent a specific population of bone-marrow dermal dendritic cells, distinct from Langerhans cells, that share some features common to mononuclear phagocytes (monocyte/macrophages). In addition, the detection of HLA-DQ on 48% of FXIIIa+ cells and the lack of OKMI in combination with high OKM5 expression suggests an antigen-presenting cell phenotype.\r"

Seven cases developed following penetrating ocular trauma. One occurred in an intravenous drug abuser. Five eyes ultimately underwent enucleation; only the two eyes that developed endophthalmitis after elective surgery retained useful vision. Review of the literature indicates that parenteral and intravitreal antibiotic prophylaxis against endophthalmitis after penetrating ocular trauma should include gentamicin, in combination with vancomycin or clindamycin, to provide adequate coverage against infection with Bacillus spp., as prognosis is poor once infection is established. Bacillus spp. cultured from ocular tissues or fluids should not be dismissed as contaminants.\r"

The overall actuarial survival rate was 51% at 5 years, 44% at 10, and 33% at 15 years. A low orbital recurrence rate of 6% compares very favourably with published figures for this event after enucleation for melanoma with extrascleral extension but without radiotherapy. Adjuvant orbital radiotherapy may have a place in the treatment of selected cases of extracleral extension of intraocular malignant melanoma.\r"

A significant delay in recovery of visual acuity was found with increasing age of recipient. The increased average time from donor death to surgery for K-Sol (56 hours) and McCarey-Kaufman (40 hours) corneas compared with moist chamber corneas (15 hours) facilitated the scheduling of surgery at the cost of increased chance of primary graft failure.\r"

As an approach toward genetic therapy of this disease, we constructed a retroviral vector encoding human FVIII and a selectable and amplifiable genetic marker, human adenosine deaminase (Ada). A retrovirus packaging line was transfected with this vector and stable transformants were selected for Ada expression. Isolated transformants produced both FVIII activity in the conditioned medium and retrovirus capable of transferring the Ada selectable marker and FVIII expression to the mouse 3T3 fibroblasts. Selection of virus-producer cell lines for increasing levels of Ada expression yielded a 20-fold increase in both FVIII expression and viral titer. Similarly, selection of infected 3T3 fibroblasts for Ada gene amplification yielded a 20-fold increase in FVIII expression. The results demonstrate the feasibility of retrovirus-mediated transfer of human FVIII, and also the utility of selection for gene amplification to increase retrovirus titers in producer cell lines as well as expression levels in infected cells.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma levels of soluble T-suppressor/cytotoxic antigen (sCD8) were measured at diagnosis or before systemic treatment in 69 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL). The 49 nonsplenectomized patients were characterized by high concentrations of sCD8 antigen as compared with 17 controls (P less than .0001). The median sCD8 level in non-splenectomized patients was 1,050 U/mL (range: 160 to 2,400 U/mL) and was significantly higher (P less than .0001) than the median of 275 U/mL (range: 20 to 1,080 U/mL) in splenectomized patients. The relationship of sCD8 to clinical response to subsequent interferon alpha (IFN alpha) treatment was analyzed. Patients who showed subsequent hematologic response with normalization of all blood counts had significantly lower levels of sCD8 concentrations at diagnosis than those who did not (P = .0056). Furthermore, normalization of sCD8 during IFN alpha treatment paralleled the achievement of normal counts in peripheral blood, whereas soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels remained high in most patients after 12 to 15 months of treatment. We speculate that activation of suppressor/cytotoxic T cells might play a role in myelosuppression, and its modulation during treatment with IFN alpha correlates with normalization in peripheral blood counts.\r"

The sensitivity of previously described single-color immunofluorescence techniques to low levels of clonal excess is limited by background from cytophilic immunoglobulins on non-B cells and by the low proportion of circulating B cells in individuals with minimal disease. We have used two-color immunofluorescence and B-cell gating to develop an improved assay that avoids false positives due to non-B cells, without requiring restrictive light scatter gates that may exclude true positives. This method is sensitive to 0.2% monoclonal B cells admixed with fresh normal lymphocytes, to 0.6% monoclonal B cells admixed with normal lymphocytes that have been stored for up to 72 hours, and readily detects 1% monoclonal cells in patient specimens. The two color B-cell gated assay offers sensitivity equivalent to the single-color assay and improved specificity for detection of low levels of clonal excess.\r"

  ".U": "90167286\r", 
  ".W": "The normal red blood cell (RBC) membrane is remarkable for its durability (eg, preservation of permeability barrier function) despite its need to remain deformable for the benefit of microvascular blood flow. Yet, it may be hypothesized that the membrane's tolerance of deformation might be compromised under certain pathologic conditions. We studied this by subjecting normal RBC in viscous suspending medium (20% dextran) to elliptical deformation induced by application of shear stress under physiologic conditions (290 mOsm/L, 37 degrees C, pH 7.40) in the presence of ouabain and furosemide. Measurement of resulting net passive K efflux (\"K leak\") demonstrated that shear-induced RBC deformation causes K leak in a dose-dependent fashion at shear stresses far below the hemolytic threshold, an effect shown to be due to deformation per se. To model the specific hypothesis that oxidatively perturbed RBC membranes would be abnormally susceptible to this potentially adverse effect of deformation, we treated normal RBC with the lipid peroxidant t-butylhydroperoxide. Under conditions inducing only minimal K leak due to either oxidation alone or deformation alone, deformation of peroxidant-pretreated RBC showed a markedly enhanced K leak (P less than .001). This highly synergistic oxidation-plus-deformation leak pathway is less active at low pH, is neither chloride-dependent nor calcium-dependent, and allows K efflux to be balanced by Na influx so there is no change in total monovalent cation content or cell density. Moreover, it is fully reversible since deformation-induced K leak terminates on cessation of shear stress (even for oxidant-treated RBC). Control experiments showed that our results are not explained simply by hemolysis, RBC vesiculation, or development of prelytic pores. We conclude that oxidation and deformation individually promote passive leak of monovalent cation through RBC membranes and that a markedly synergistic effect is exerted when the two stresses are combined. We hypothesize that these findings may help explain the abnormal monovalent cation leak stimulated by deoxygenation of sickle RBC.\r"

Careful research using modern techniques, however, has shown that there is no such organism and that Livingston-Wheeler has apparently mistaken several different types of bacteria, both rare and common, for a unique microbe. In spite of diligent research to isolate a cancer-causing microorganism, none has been found. Similarly, Livingston-Wheeler's autologous vaccine cannot be considered an effective treatment for cancer. While many oncologists have expressed the hope that someday a vaccine will be developed against cancer, the cause(s) of cancer must be determined before research can be directed toward developing a vaccine. The rationale for other facets of the Livingston-Wheeler cancer therapy is similarly faulty. No evidence supports her contention that cancer results from a defective immune system, that a whole-foods diet restores immune system deficiencies, that abscisic acid slows tumor growth, or that cancer is transmitted to humans by chickens.\r"

PT and MN from the same patient showed heterogeneity in chemosensitivity. MN were more sensitive to the agents than PT. PT were sensitive to 5-FU, whereas MN were sensitive to CDDP. An analysis of the sensitivity correlations showed that the sensitivities of PT to MMC, 5-FU, CQ, and CDDP correlated with each other, but ADR sensitivity correlated with only CQ sensitivity. The sensitivities of MN correlated with each other, except for those to ADR and CDDP. In contrast, MMC, ADR, or CQ sensitivity showed a correlation between PT and MN. These results suggest that patients should be treated according to the sensitivity of the target lesion. However, if the sensitivity assay is not available, the sensitivity correlation may be useful when choosing the agent. It also may be important that ADR sensitivity does not correlate with the sensitivities of other agents.\r"

Although pubertal development and testosterone levels were normal in all patients, 18 of 75 (24.0%) had elevated basal and 65/74 (87.8%) elevated stimulated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, demonstrating chemotherapy-induced Leydig cell damage. In addition, there was a 40.5% and 53.4% incidence of elevated basal and stimulated FSH values, respectively, indicating severe impairment of spermatogenesis as confirmed by azoospermia in four patients. Testicular dysfunction was observed in patients treated before as well as during puberty. The incidence of elevated basal follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH values was significantly higher in patients who had received higher cumulative doses of chemotherapy, i.e., 28.9% and 13.2% with two OPPA, 45.5% and 36.4% with two OPPA/two COPP, and 62.5% and 43.8% with two OPPA/four to six COPP, respectively. Chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease causes a high and apparently dose-related incidence of testicular dysfunction in prepubertal as well as in pubertal boys affecting Leydig cell function as well as spermatogenesis. Circumstantial evidence indicates that procarbazine is the major gonadotoxic agent involved.\r"

Serum concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, and prolactin were measured. A sperm sample was obtained from 46 men. The patients had smaller testicles than healthy medical students; 51 had small testicles. The size was the smallest in patients who survived leukemia. Multivariate analysis showed that the variables with independent effects on testicular size were cranial and testicular irradiation and therapy with cyclophosphamide. Sperm production was dependent on testicular size. We conclude that determination of serum FSH combined with testicular size may offer a practical approach for predicting the subsequent testicular damage in boys with malignancies.\r"

Ten patients (group I) were managed with nitroglycerin (0.2 to 0.4 mg i.c.) and repeated attempts at mechanical guide wire recanalization or dilation, but they did not receive thrombolytic therapy. In the remaining 23 patients (group II), intracoronary urokinase (100,000 to 360,000 U.I.) was administered over 15-20 min after onset of coronary occlusion or thrombosis and continued during attempts at repeated dilation of the stenosis. The incidence of sudden coronary artery occlusion was 70% in group I patients and 52% in group II. The angiographic evidence of thrombus formation was observed in a higher, but not significant, proportion of group II patients (65%) as compared with group I (30%). The incidence of intimal tearing or dissection was similar in the two groups of patients (40 vs. 34.7%). The overall final success rate of the complicated angioplasty series was 48% (6/33). However, the success rate was lower (10%) in group I than in group II patients (10 vs. 65%; P less than 0.005), and the frequency of emergency coronary artery bypass grafting was lower in group II patients (13 vs. 60%; P = 0.01), suggesting that thrombolytic therapy with urokinase may be effective in the management of acute coronary occlusion and thromboembolic complications of coronary angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Coronary vascular injury promotes blood cell-vessel wall interactions that influence arachidonic acid metabolism and coronary blood flow patterns. Since lipoxygenase and cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid are synthesized by vascular and inflammatory cells and have a variety of important biological actions, we investigated the metabolism of arachidonic acid by these pathways in normal and stenosed, endothelially injured canine coronary arteries. We found and confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry that primarily 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are synthesized by both coronary artery segments. Lesser amounts of 11-, 9-, 8-, and 5-HETEs are also produced. 15-Ketoeicosatetraenoic acid is also synthesized. The synthesis of 14C-HETEs is fivefold to 10-fold greater by the stenosed than the normal coronary artery. Specific radioimmunoassays indicated that the stenosed coronary artery synthesized 93 +/- 14 and 1,102 +/- 154 ng/g of tissue of 15- and 12-HETE, respectively, while the normal coronary artery produced 17 +/- 3 and 162 +/- 68 ng/g of tissue of 15- and 12-HETE, respectively. Products comigrating with 14,15-; 11,12-; 8,9-; and 5,6-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and the corresponding dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) were detected predominantly in stenosed coronary arteries by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The structures of the EETs were confirmed by GC/MS. The EETs and prostaglandin I2 produced endothelium-independent, concentration-related relaxations of dog coronary artery rings. These data indicate that normal and stenotic coronary arteries metabolize arachidonic acid to HETEs, DHETs, and EETs along with prostaglandins; however, the synthesis of these metabolites is greater in the stenosed, endothelially injured vessel. The EETs may be synthesized during the development of cyclic flow variations and counteract the vasoconstrictor effects of thromboxane A2.\r"

  ".W": "This study addresses the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a primary vasodilator, which reduces arterial pressure directly and increases total peripheral resistance secondarily by reflex mechanisms. The effects of 30-minute infusions of ANF (0.3 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) were examined in conscious dogs, rats, and monkeys before and after ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium. In seven intact, conscious dogs, ANF reduced mean arterial pressure by 7 +/- 1% and cardiac output by 19 +/- 3% and increased total peripheral resistance by 15 +/- 3%. After ganglionic blockade, ANF reduced mean arterial pressure by 7 +/- 2% but still increased total peripheral resistance by 15 +/- 3%. Similar results were observed in four dogs with total cardiac denervation and in six dogs with arterial baroreceptor denervation. Furthermore, in two dogs, combined ganglionic and alpha 1-adrenoceptor blockades failed to alter the rise in total peripheral resistance observed with ANF. In six intact, conscious rats, ANF reduced mean arterial pressure by 8 +/- 2% and cardiac output by 27 +/- 2% and increased total peripheral resistance by 27 +/- 5%. After ganglionic blockade, ANF still increased total peripheral resistance by 13 +/- 3%. In six intact, conscious monkeys, ANF reduced mean arterial pressure by 14 +/- 2% and cardiac output by 26 +/- 3% and increased total peripheral resistance by 17 +/- 3%. However, after ganglionic blockade. ANF decreased total peripheral resistance by 11 +/- 2%. These data provide evidence for a fundamental species difference in the vascular actions of ANF. In conscious dogs, ANF elicits \"direct\" vasoconstriction, which increases total peripheral resistance, even in the presence of denervation of reflexes or autonomic blockade. In conscious rats, ANF elicits both direct and reflexly mediated vasoconstriction. In conscious monkeys, although a component of direct vasoconstriction may also be present, the most prominent component appears to be reflexly mediated, since it was abolished by ganglionic blockade.\r"

  ".W": "Effects of flecainide, a potent antiarrhythmic agent, on sodium channel availability was investigated in guinea pig single cardiac cells by the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. Sodium current (INa) experiments were performed at 17 degrees C, and maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) experiments were performed at 37 degrees C. Flecainide (3 microM) caused little tonic block, but reduced sodium channel availability in a use-dependent manner. The latter effect was accentuated by depolarization and attenuated by hyperpolarization. Long (200-msec) and short (10-msec) depolarizations yielded similar use-dependent block. These results indicate that flecainide has a low affinity for rested (R) and inactivated (I) channels but a high affinity for activated ones (A). In each of these states, the channels can bind to drug to form the corresponding RD, ID, and AD states. Recovery from flecainide block consisted of two components. An initial fast component was strongly voltage dependent: with increasing hyperpolarization, recovery developed more quickly and to a larger extent. At 17 degrees C, the mean time constant shortened from 132 +/- 81.6 msec at -120 mV to 46.9 +/- 34.1 msec at +/- 160 mV (kinetics were too fast for accurate measurement at 37 degrees C). A later slow component was largely voltage independent: at 37 degrees C, the mean time constant was 9.8 +/- 3.2 seconds at -100 mV and 10.7 +/- 3.8 seconds at -75 mV. The slow component of recovery was similarly independent of voltage at 17 degrees C. In terms of the modulated-receptor theory, our results indicate that the fast recovery depends on availability for unblocking (RD) but occurs during activation (AD----A). Indeed, when the RD state is maximized by strong hyperpolarization, activation unblock was also maximized. However, during depolarization to -100 mV, availability for activation unblock declined with a time constant of 98 +/- 12 msec (RD----ID). Therefore, the voltage-dependent fast unblocking is mostly due to priming of the RD state (RD----ID), and the voltage-independent slow unblock reflects dissociation of flecainide from closed states (RD----R and ID----I). We conclude that flecainide interacts with sodium channels preferentially in the activated state, whereas unblocking occurs via two separate pathways: activated and closed states. Furthermore, drug association with channels shifts the voltage dependence of closed-state transitions (RD in equilibrium ID) and their kinetics toward more negative potentials.\r"

  ".W": "Regularly discharging baroreceptors in a rat in vitro aortic arch preparation were exposed to increasing concentrations of one of four vasoactive peptides: angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic factor, or substance P. Slow ramps of pressure evoked discharge responses in single-fiber baroreceptors. Instantaneous discharge frequency was measured simultaneously with aortic diameter and pressure. During constriction induced by angiotensin II or arginine vasopressin, baroreceptor diameter threshold (Dth) decreased and pressure threshold (Pth) tended to increase; these effects were reduced or eliminated by nitroprusside. Atrial natriuretic factor and substance P by themselves were without effect on vessel diameter or on baroreceptor discharge. In preparations preconstricted with a moderate concentration of phenylephrine (10(-8) M), atrial natriuretic factor reduced the phenylephrine-induced constriction and increased Dth and decreased Pth. Substance P, even at high concentrations, was less effective than atrial natriuretic factor in reducing phenylephrine constriction and in altering baroreceptor discharge. Baroreceptor gain was unaffected by any of these peptides. Thus, changes in smooth muscle tone altered mechanotransduction by shifts in 1) the vessel pressure-diameter relation and 2) baroreceptor threshold requirements (Pth and Dth). Changes in the baroreceptor mechanical threshold (Dth) reduced the effects on Pth expected from changes in vessel wall mechanics. Pth reflects the net effects of vessel wall and Dth changes. Pth generally increased during constrictions and decreased during dilations. The changes in Dth and their selectivity (no changes in gain) during vasoactive peptide action closely resemble rapid resetting of baroreceptors. We propose that vascular smooth muscle lies in a parallel arrangement with aortic baroreceptors and that a common compensatory mechanism regulates Dth during sustained changes in vessel diameter. Activation of smooth muscle and reductions in transmural pressure would reduce loading of baroreceptors, and the proposed compensatory mechanism would tend to keep discharge constant by decreasing Dth. Our experiments, however, cannot distinguish between hypotheses for local micromechanical changes in coupling or for changes modulating excitability within the baroreceptor neuron itself as the basis for Dth adjustments.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets play an important role in the formation of a coronary thrombus and reocclusion after thrombolysis. Therefore, we examined the thrombolytic potential of concomitant intravenous administration of potent platelet inhibitor iloprost, a prostacyclin analogue, with tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA; n = 8) and t-PA alone (n = 9) in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. t-PA (0.75 mg/kg) was given over 20 minutes, and iloprost (4 micrograms/kg) was given over 40 minutes. Reperfusion rate was 63% (five of eight dogs) in the t-PA plus iloprost group and 67% (six of nine dogs) in the t-PA alone group (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in the t-PA plus iloprost group was almost twice as great as in the t-PA alone group (33.0 +/- 13.3 vs. 18.5 +/- 6.7 minutes, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion was much shorter (3.4 +/- 1.8 vs. 39.3 +/- 17.4 minutes, p less than 0.005). Peak coronary artery blood flow after reperfusion in the t-PA plus iloprost group was also less (20 +/- 17 ml/min) than in the t-PA alone group (58 +/- 21 ml/min, p less than 0.005). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given t-PA with iloprost despite potent synergistic platelet inhibitory effects of t-PA and iloprost, whereas four of six dogs given t-PA alone reoccluded. Neither regimen exerted a significant beneficial effect on regional myocardial shortening during coronary reperfusion. Plasma levels of t-PA were lower when iloprost was given with t-PA (1,022 +/- 360 vs. 1,459 +/- 270 ng/ml in t-PA alone group, p less than 0.05). The detrimental effects of iloprost identified in this study may relate to the reduction in plasma t-PA concentrations by its degradation in the liver caused by the prostacyclin analogue iloprost.\r"

  ".W": "Many of the newer antiarrhythmic agents are said to cause minimal myocardial depression, but their hemodynamic effects have not been invasively evaluated and compared in patients with severe chronic heart failure. In a randomized, crossover study, the hemodynamic responses to single oral doses of procainamide (750 mg), tocainide (600 mg), and encainide (50 mg) given to 21 patients with severe chronic heart failure were compared. Cardiac performance decreased with all three drugs, but the magnitude of deterioration differed among the three agents. Stroke volume index decreased with procainamide (-5 +/- 1 ml/m2, p less than 0.001), tocainide (-7 +/- 1 ml/m2, p less than 0.001), and encainide (-8 +/- 1 ml/m2, p less than 0.001), but the decline was significantly greater with encainide than with procainamide (p less than 0.05). Similarly, left ventricular filling pressure increased with tocainide and encainide (+4 +/- 1 and +5 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively; both p less than 0.05), but not with procainamide; the increase was significantly greater with tocainide and encainide than with procainamide (p less than 0.001). These deleterious hemodynamic effects were accompanied by worsening symptoms of heart failure in six patients with encainide and seven patients with tocainide but in only two patients with procainamide. Serum levels for all drugs were in the therapeutic range. In conclusion, although the three type I antiarrhythmic agents tested may all adversely affect left ventricular function in patients with heart failure, encainide and tocainide are more likely than procainamide to cause hemodynamic and clinical deterioration.\r"

After termination of extra-corporeal circulation, DDAVP (0.3 microgram/kg body wt) or its vehicle was infused into a peripheral vein throughout 15 minutes. The increase in factor VIII coagulant activity after infusion did not differ between the groups but there was a significantly larger increase in vWF:Ag levels in DDAVP-treated patients. The aggregatory response to adenosine-diphosphate (ADP) and ristocetin showed a normal pattern and was not significantly different between the two groups. As compared with placebo, DDAVP did not decrease the bleeding time or the postoperative blood loss. We conclude that DDAVP causes an increase in vWF:Ag levels but does not alter platelet aggregation, bleeding time, or blood loss in uncomplicated coronary artery bypass patients.\r"

Coronary arterial patency was assessed angiographically 60 minutes and 90 minutes after initiation of treatment. Patency was achieved in 19 of 31 patients (61.3%) (95% confidence limits, 42-78%) at 60 minutes and in 27 of 33 patients (81.8%) (95% confidence limits, 65-93%) at 90 minutes. Nonspecific plasminogen activation was monitored by measuring relevant plasma parameters. At 60 minutes and 120 minutes, the fibrinogen concentration decreased slightly to 82.8 +/- 24.3% and 91.2 +/- 17.4% of the preinfusion level, and the plasminogen concentration to 66.3 +/- 15.2% and 65.3 +/- 13.4%, respectively. A greater consumption of alpha 2-antiplasmin was observed, which decreased to 30.7 +/- 22.8% and 32.2 +/- 21.2% of the preinfusion level at 60 and 120 minutes, respectively. No bleeding necessitating transfusion was observed. Two patients (5.3%) died during hospitalization. The findings suggest that the combined intravenous infusion of rt-PA and scuPA at appropriate doses induces highly effective coronary thrombolysis equal to the best results obtained with either rt-PA or scuPA alone. This efficacy is coupled with high specificity. Thus, the data support the potential use of combinations of rt-PA and scuPA in place of monotherapy.\r"

This study was planned to determine whether this impairment also occurs in humans. In 30 patients admitted to a coronary care unit for an anterior (n = 14) or inferior (n = 16) transmural myocardial infarction (MI), we measured 1) the increase in RR interval induced by stimulating carotid baroreceptors through progressive reductions in neck chamber pressure, 2) the increase in RR interval induced by stimulating arterial baroreceptors through intravenous boluses of phenylephrine, and 3) the reduction in RR interval induced by deactivating arterial baroreceptors through intravenous boluses of nitroglycerin. Measurements were performed 49.5 +/- 2.4 hours (mean +/- SEM) after the MI. The results were compared with those of five age-matched patients admitted to the coronary care unit for chest pain and found free from ischemic heart disease. The sensitivity of the carotid baroreceptor-heart rate reflex (slope of the linear regression of RR interval over neck pressure changes) was markedly less in MI than in control patients (3.8 +/- 0.5 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.6 msec/mm Hg, p less than 0.05), the reduction being similar in patients with anterior and inferior MI. This was the case also for the baroreflex sensitivity measured by the phenylephrine and the nitroglycerin methods (slope of the linear regression of RR interval over systolic blood pressure changes). However, 10.2 +/- 0.3 days later, the baroreflex sensitivity measured by all three methods increased significantly (p less than 0.05 or 0.01) and became similar to that of control subjects, which showed no significant change from the early to the late period after admission into the coronary care unit. Thus, MI is accompanied by an acute marked impairment of the baroreceptor control of the heart in humans, and this is the case both for an anterior and an inferior MI. The impairment is largely transient in nature, however, and a clear-cut recovery of the baroreflex can be seen a few days later.\r"

  ".W": "Perfusion lung scintigrams, pulmonary gas exchange data, and chest roentgenograms were obtained in 33 patients during acute embolism and over the following six months in order to assess their clinical usefulness in monitoring the effect of therapy. To this purpose, the measurement of pulmonary gas exchange and the presence of chest x-ray findings were compared with perfusion lung scintigraphic abnormalities both at diagnosis and after 7, 30, and 180 days during treatment. More than 50 percent of the pulmonary arterial tree was obstructed at diagnosis, and a large part of perfusion recovery was complete within the first month. All of the gas exchange parameters were abnormal at diagnosis, and the rate of their improvement was related to that of perfusion recovery. Interestingly, PaO2st (ie, PaO2 corrected for hyperventilation) and VE tended to return to normal during the first month as a consequence of the progressive recovery of perfusion, whereas oxygen and carbon dioxide gradients and physiologic dead space showed the persistence of some abnormalities six months after diagnosis. Significant correlations were observed between the number of ULSs evaluated on the perfusion lung scintigram (and considered an index of the severity of pulmonary embolization) and all of the gas exchange parameters at diagnosis (correlation coefficients averaged from 0.41 to 0.73) and after 7 and 30 days. The enlargement of the right descending pulmonary artery and particularly the \"sausage\" sign and the Westermark sign were significantly associated with a higher degree of gas exchange impairment and with a more severe embolization. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that perfusion lung scintigraphy has a primary role in monitoring the recovery of patients with pulmonary embolism under treatment. Moreover, the chest roentgenogram may help in this purpose. A second major result is that the simple measurement of some gas exchange parameters may allow the assessment of functional recovery of these patients, thus giving additional information about the effect of therapy.\r"

By integrative computer modeling, we have used previously obtained pharmacokinetic data in experimental endocarditis to characterize aminoglycoside distribution within various geographic sectors of aortic vegetations of rabbits and humans in the current study. In rabbits with pseudomonal aortic endocarditis receiving a standard regimen of amikacin (15 mg/kg every eight hours), sub-MBC levels of the drug for the infecting organism were calculated in the center of 0.38-cm vegetations; this occurred despite supra-MBC levels calculated in plasma and more peripheral loci of the vegetation. In contrast, with a high-dose regimen of amikacin (40 mg/kg every eight hours), supra-MBC drug levels were calculated throughout the entire vegetation for at least 50 percent of the dosing interval. Using similar computer-generated approaches, these data in the rabbit were approximately in simulated aminoglycoside penetration of 10-mm human aortic vegetations. Aminoglycoside regimens designed to yield supra-MBC serum levels in both normal and rapid drug eliminators consistently achieved sub-MBC levels in the center of the vegetation. Computer simulations also confirmed that daily doses of aminoglycoside at least two to four times higher than those ordinarily recommended are necessary to consistently achieve uniform supra-MBC intravegetation levels for an entire dosing interval. Such computer-generated data support the concept of maldistribution of aminoglycosides in aortic endocarditis and provide a rationale for investigating the use of high-dose regimens of aminoglycoside in treating experimental endocarditis.\r"

Radial arterial blood was sampled at rest and maximal exercise simultaneously to pulse oximetric determination. Measured blood oxygen saturation was significantly different from noninvasive saturation at rest and also at exercise for each device. Nevertheless, changes in pulse oximetry from rest to exercise were significantly correlated with measured saturation for all three devices. Direction of changes in saturation from rest to exercise was correctly evaluated by transcutaneous oximetry in all but six instances where changes were less than 4 percent. Although measured and transcutaneous saturations are significantly different, we conclude that pulse oximetry reliably estimates changes in arterial saturation between rest and exercise for a clinical purpose. None of the three tested devices was better compared with the others in estimating saturation changes at exercise.\r"

The PEP group also used less antibiotics and mucolytics. The PEP group had a small increase in FEV1 of mean 62 ml compared to a small decrease of 43 ml for the control group. Treatment with a simple PEP device can reduce morbidity in patients with chronic bronchitis and may preserve lung function from a more rapid decline.\r"

Histological appearances, enterocyte enzyme activities, and in vitro glucose transport were studied at the donor and recipient graft sites in control, short-bowel syndrome, and gastrocolic fistula 5-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Small intestinal function was maintained in the jejunocolonic graft after 80% small bowel resection; animals in which small bowel was not resected showed loss of graft function and enzyme activity. This effect is dependent on the presence of jejunal chyme: after gastrocolic fistulae, the jejunum to colon grafts lost jejunal functional activities. Total parenteral nutrition did not alter graft behavior but improved the postoperative mortality of the procedures. The results provide additional information on intestinal adaptation in SBS.\r"

The antibody detected as little as 0.01 ng of mouse EGF in dot blots at 1:100,000 dilution and 5 pg of EGF in RIA at 1:50,000 dilution; it did not cross-react with transforming growth factor-alpha, insulin-like growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor. Ovarian EGF content peaked (17 +/- 2 pg/nonluteal ovary) on Day 1 (estrus as determined by copious vaginal discharge) and declined by DAy 3 as measured by RIA of immunoaffinity-purified ovarian extract. Frozen sections of hamster ovaries were stained immunohistochemically for EGF using a Zymed kit. Intense red staining specific for EGF was localized only in granulosa cells of small (1-2 layers of granulosa cells) and medium (3-6 layers of granulosa cells) preantral follicles; moderate staining was observed in the granulosa and theca cells of small antral follicles. Staining intensity faded in granulosa and theca cells of large antral follicles, especially on Day 4 (proestrus) and disappeared in pyknotic granulosa cells of atretic follicles. Follicular EGF staining peaked on Days 1 and 2 and thereafter declined to low levels. On Day 2, oocytes of the primordial follicles showed distinct coloration. Sections of Day 2 ovary incubated with preneutralized antibody or normal rabbit IgG did not show any coloration. For intact hamsters, 10 micrograms of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), twice daily for Days 1 and 2, intensified EGF staining in granulosa cells compared with corresponding untreated Day 3 hamsters, whereas similar treatment with luteinizing hormone for 2 days expanded the interstitium with localized staining of interstitial cells only around follicles with 2 and 3 layers of granulosa cells and lacking theca. Hypophysectomy for 13 days resulted in almost complete absence of EGF-specific staining in the remaining nonatretic follicles; however, exogenous FSH (5 micrograms, twice daily) for 2 days dramatically increased staining intensity associated with newly developed follicles. Luteinizing hormone (0.4 micrograms, twice daily) for 2 days, however, induced significant development of only the interstitium with increased staining of small preantral follicles. These results provide strong evidence for the presence of EGF-like activity in hamster ovarian follicles and suggest that its expression is controlled by gonadotropins, especially FSH.\r"

  ".W": "It was previously shown in this laboratory that high affinity binding of [125I]ACTH-(1-24) to membranes from rat brain was inhibited by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), GH-releasing factor (GRF), and dynorphin (DYN), but not by other peptides tested. We now show that these peptides compete for [125I]VIP binding in brain and for [125I]ACTH-(1-24) binding in adrenal cortex and promote steroidogenesis. The high affinity sites for [125I]ACTH-(1-24) in the rat brain and bovine adrenal had Kd values of 0.51 +/- 0.41 and 3.9 +/- 1.3 nM, respectively; and the Ki values for VIP were 5.4 +/- 4.2 and 1.4 +/- 0.51 nM, respectively. In rat brain and bovine adrenal the high affinity site for [125I]VIP had Kd values of 2.9 +/- 1.7 and 0.5 +/- 0.8 nM, respectively, and Ki values for ACTH of 23.6 +/- 14.0 and 22.2 +/- 33.0 nM, respectively. In brain, DYN and GRF inhibited binding of [125I]VIP with Ki values of 49 and 30 nM, respectively. Cortisol secretion from isolated bovine adrenal cortical cells was significantly stimulated by 10(-10) M ACTH, VIP, DYN, or GRF, and a maximal response occurred for each at 10(-8) M. However, maximal cortisol production in response to VIP, DYN, or GRF was only about half that by ACTH-(1-24). The combination of ACTH-(1-24) and VIP, each at 10(-10) M, was additive in stimulating cortisol production, whereas each at 10(-8) M caused no greater response than ACTH alone. There was an additive steroidogenic effect of VIP plus ACTH-(1-10), but not VIP plus ACTH-(11-24). Specific binding of [125I]ACTH-(11-24) in adrenal membranes was inhibited by unlabeled ACTH-(11-24), ACTH-(1-24), VIP, GRF, and DYN, but not by ACTH-(1-10), peptide T, TRH, alpha MSH, or beta-endorphin; there was no specific binding of [125I]ACTH-(1-10). Functional studies and binding data, in conjunction with the existence of homologous amino acid sequences, indicate that VIP, GRF, and DYN interact at a subpopulation of ACTH receptors that recognizes a moiety within the 11-24 sequence of the ACTH molecule.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) was compared in two clonal lines of rat Nb2 node lymphoma cells, the lactogen-dependent Nb2-11C line and the lactogen-independent Nb2-Sp (spontaneous) line. Both cell lines expressed mRNA transcripts for the G-protein species Gs alpha [1.85 kilobases (kb)], Gi2 alpha (2.35 kb), Go alpha (4.1-4.5 kb), and Gi3 alpha (3.5 kb). Gi1 alpha was not detected. ADP ribosylation in the presence of activated cholera or pertussis toxins and [32P]NAD demonstrated the presence of G-proteins in the membrane fractions of both lines. The cholera toxin substrates consisted of two proteins (mol wt, 46.5 and 43.5 kD), while a single protein (mol wt, 41.5 kD) was ADP ribosylated by pertussis toxin. Surprisingly, the cholera toxin-sensitive proteins (Gs) were at least 20-fold less abundant in the Nb2-Sp cells than in the Nb2-11C cells. Since Gs and Gi2 are associated with the adenylate cyclase system and the regulation of intracellular cAMP, the effects of the cAMP analog, (Bu)2cAMP (dbcAMP), on Nb2-11C and Nb2-Sp cell growth were examined. dbcAMP (100 microM) completely inhibited the growth of lactogen-dependent Nb2-11C cells. The inhibitory effect of dbcAMP was exerted at an early point in the cell cycle, as it also inhibited PRL-stimulated c-myc expression measured 3 h after addition of the mitogen. In contrast, dbcAMP had only minor inhibitory effects on lactogen-independent Nb2-Sp cells, increasing their doubling time from 20 to 30 h and slightly reducing their density at confluence. The inhibitory effect of dbcAMP on both cell lines was reversible. Nb2-11C cells resumed growth after a lag period of approximately 3 days. The recovered cells did not arise from selection of a cAMP-resistant subpopulation, since both they and normal untreated Nb2-11C cells remained equally sensitive to dbcAMP. Similarly, Nb2-Sp cells resumed their normal doubling time upon removal of dbcAMP. The observation that the lactogen-independent Nb2-Sp cell line contained 20-fold less cholera toxin-sensitive Gs protein provides circumstantial evidence that dysfunction of the adenylate cyclase system may be implicated in the autonomous growth of these cells. This possibility is strengthened by the observation that Nb2-Sp cells are markedly less sensitive than the Nb2-11C clone to the growth inhibitory effects of an exogenous cAMP analog.\r"

To determine the effects of these conditions on the central regulation of GH secretion, we have examined their effects on the hypothalamic regulatory peptides GH-releasing hormone (GH-RH) and somatostatin (SRIF). In thyroidectomized rat hypothalamus, a dramatic increase in GH-RH mRNA occurred in parallel with a decrease in peptide content. The significance of this phenomenon is uncertain and might possibly reflect some posttranscriptional derangement of GH-RH synthesis or an increased rate of GH-RH synthesis and release. In the hyperthyroid group, GH-RH showed significant decreases in both peptide and mRNA levels that might possibly reflect a decrease in GH-RH synthesis and secretion. No change was observed in SRIF peptide or mRNA levels in either thyroidectomized or T4-treated animals. As expected, GH mRNA levels in the anterior pituitary were dramatically decreased by thyroidectomy and unaffected by T4 treatment. In addition, in thyroidectomized pituitaries, the mature GH mRNA was observed to alter its structure, increasing in size by approximately 100 nucleotides. This increase in size was found to result from an increase in poly(A) tail length, the significance of which is as yet unclear.\r"

We have conducted a comparative study of LH and FSH release in response to GnRH and to phorbol ester myristate acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, by rat pituitary cells maintained in culture. The effect of E2 pretreatment coupled or not with PKC depletion was also studied. Different kinetics in the response of LH and FSH to GnRH were observed, suggesting that the intracellular pathways involved in the release process of the two hormones were somewhat different. Moreover, PMA (10 nM) stimulated LH release greatly and FSH release only slightly. Intracellular PKC depletion, obtained by a prolonged treatment (18 h) of the cells with PMA (1 microM), produced different results according to the endocrine status of the pituitary cells. GnRH (10 nM)-induced LH release was significantly decreased in PKC-depleted cells from proestrous females. For PKC-depleted cells from OVX females, it was decreased significantly only when cells had been pretreated by E2. These results suggest that the modulation of LH secretion by E2 involves PKC activation. FSH release was poorly stimulated by PMA; but, under any conditions, PKC depletion did not affect GnRH-induced FSH release.\r"

  ".W": "A number of cytokines have been found to be potent regulators of bone resorption and to share the properties originally attributed to osteoclast-activating factor. One such activity, differentiation-inducing factor (DIF, D-factor) from mouse spleen cells, shares a number of biological and biochemical properties with the recently characterized and cloned leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). We have assessed the effects of recombinant LIF on bone resorption and other parameters in neonatal mouse calvaria. Both recombinant murine and human (h) LIFs stimulated 45Ca release from prelabeled calvaria in a dose-dependent manner. The increase in bone resorption was associated with an increase in the number of osteoclasts per mm2 bone. The osteolytic effect of hLIF were blocked by 10(-7) M indomethacin. hLIF also stimulated incorporation of [3H] thymidine into calvaria, but the dose-response relationship was distinct from that for bone resorption, and this effect was not blocked by indomethacin. Similarly, hLIF increased [3H]phenylalanine incorporation into calvaria, and this was also not inhibited by indomethacin. It is concluded that LIF stimulates bone resorption by a mechanism involving prostaglandin production, but that a distinct mechanism is responsible for its stimulation of DNA and protein synthesis. The primary structure of LIF differs from that of other fully characterized, bone-active cytokines, and it, thus, represents a novel factor which may be involved in the normal regulation of bone cell function.\r"

These antibodies, because of their specificity, are powerful tools with which to examine the localization, structure, and function of PR. A selection of 22 well characterized mABs was made to test their ability to give the best immunocytochemical staining of PR in various species. Comparative analysis of the antibodies led to the following conclusions. Li 417 (and, to a lesser extent, Let 126) was the best monoclonal in humans; Let 126 and Mi 60 were the most sensitive monoclonals in guinea pigs, rabbits, and monkeys. In sheep, sows, cows and mares as well as in rats and chickens Let 81 or Let 548 gave the best results (Let 126 was also effective in sows and mares, while Li 169 was also effective in sheep and cows). Two antibodies (Li 169 and Let 548) cross-reacted with PR in all of the species tested, including mammals and birds, and appeared to recognize two highly conserved antigenic sites. Remarkably, these conserved sequences are located in the highly variable N-terminal part of the receptor; they may, thus, be related to the still poorly understood function of this domain of the receptor.\r"

The inhibition was persistent over the time period studied. The ANP analog Tyr8-ANP, which mediates smooth muscle relaxation in other organs without elevating cGMP levels, did not inhibit the spontaneous maturation. ANP, but not Tyr8-ANP, dose-dependently stimulated cGMP accumulation in oocyte-cumulus complexes. Furthermore, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), that stimulates a soluble form of guanylate cyclase, inhibited spontaneous maturation in oocyte-cumulus complexes and stimulated cGMP accumulation in oocyte-cumulus complexes. Neither ANP nor SNP stimulated cAMP accumulation. In oocytes where the surrounding cumulus cells had been removed neither ANP nor SNP inhibited the spontaneous maturation. These results demonstrate that cumulus cells, but not the oocyte itself, have ANP receptors and guanylate cyclases. Furthermore, ANP, via cGMP, can influence oocyte meiosis, suggesting a possible involvement of ANP and cGMP in the control of the meiotic process in rat oocytes.\r"

The rat hypothalamus is able to synthesize EETs from exogenous AA, and 5,6-EET has been found to release the neuropeptide somatostatin (SRIF) from hypothalamic nerve terminals of the median eminence (ME). In the present study, hypothalami from male rats were examined for the presence of endogenous EETs, using chemical, chromatographic, and mass spectral analysis procedures. The samples were initially separated in a C18 Sepralyte column, fractionated on TLC plates, and purified by reverse phase HPLC. Thereafter, they were esterified (pentafluorobenzyl esters) and subjected to negative ion chemical ionization/gas chromatography (GC)/mass spectral (MS) analysis. The GC retention time and the MS fragmentation patterns revealed the presence of a mixture of 8,9-, 11,12- and 14,15-EETs; instability of 5,6-EET during the isolation protocol precluded its identification. Total hypothalamic EET concentration was estimated to be 120 ng/g wet tissue. The 8,9-regiosomer released SRIF from ME nerve terminals with an ED50 of 5 x 10(-12) M; Dopamine (DA) and the D2 receptor agonist PPHT, but not the D1 receptor agonist SKF-38393, induced SRIF release from the ME. This effect was blocked by clotrimazole and ketoconazole, two inhibitors of microsomal cytochrome P-450 function and AA epoxygenase in particular. In contrast, the inhibitors failed to affect the increase in SRIF release induced by 8,9-EET. These results indicate that: 1) in addition to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products, epoxygenase metabolites of AA are endogenous compounds of the hypothalamus, and 2) EETs may mediate the increase in SRIF release from hypothalamic neurons induced by the interaction of DA with D2 receptors.\r"

Similarly dopamine withdrawal alone cannot completely explain the profiles of PRL secretion observed under a variety of conditions. We describe here the isolation in semipurified form of both a PRF and a PRL-inhibiting factor (PIF) from bovine neurointermediate lobe (NIL) extracts. Acid extracts of bovine NILs stimulated, in a dose-related manner, PRL release from cultured anterior pituitary cells, even after immunoabsorption of endogenous oxytocin from the extract. PIF and PRF activities were semipurified from NIL extracts by Sephadex chromatography and detected by in vitro and in vitro bioassays. The PRF material could be separated from oxytocin by gel sieving and was active in the presence of dopamine in vitro unlike synthetic oxytocin and in cell preparations in which the oxytocin-responsive lactotrophs had been removed by selective cytotoxin cell targeting using an oxytocin-ricin A chain cytotoxic conjugate. The PRF material stimulated PRL secretion in a dose-dependent fashion in conscious male rats after iv injection. The PIF material comigrated on sizing gel chromatography with immunoreactive oxytocin and was active in vitro during dopamine blockade with domperidone and in vivo in the presence of endogenous dopaminergic tone. These data suggest that novel factors present in the NIL might exert physiologically relevant control over lactotroph function and add to the growing literature on the presence of a PRF in the NIL.\r"

An inhibitory effect on CDP labeling was observed at 96 h with PGE2 (10(-6) M) in the absence or presence of indomethacin (10(-6) M), but not in the presence of cortisol (10(-8) or 10(-7) M). When the central osteoblast-rich bone and periosteum were analyzed separately, the inhibitory effect of PGE2, with or without indomethacin, was confined to the central bone. Addition of aphidicolin (30 microM), an inhibitor of cell replication, did not prevent the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on CDP labeling. Analysis of labeled collagen by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed a decrease in labeling of type I collagen in central bone. Moreover, mRNA for alpha 1(I)procollagen was decreased, as measured by dot blot hybridization and Northern blot analysis. Cortisol (10(-8)-10(-6) M) decreased the labeling of CDP as well as noncollagen protein (NCP) at 96 h. In the presence of cortisol, PGE2 (10(-8)-10(-5) M) consistently stimulated labeling of CDP and NCP, with a greater increase in CDP, resulting in an increase in the percentage of collagen synthesized. In the presence of low concentrations of cortisol (10(-8) or 3 x 10(-8) M), PGE2 (10(-7) M) increased CDP labeling by 260-480%, and the absolute value was 145-160% of that in control cultures without any hormone addition. The stimulatory effect was seen in both central bone and periosteum, although absolute values for CDP and percentage of collagen synthesized were higher in central bone. PGE2 (10(-7) M) had similar effects on CDP at 24 and 96 h in the presence of cortisol, and the stimulation at 10(-7) M was the same in the presence and absence of aphidicolin, suggesting that it was not dependent on cell replication. Cortisol decreased labeling of type I collagen, determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and alpha 1(I)procollagen mRNA levels, determined by both Northern and dot blot analysis. PGE2 reversed these effects, increasing both radiolabeled collagen type I chains and alpha 1(I)procollagen mRNA levels. These results indicate that PGE2 can regulate bone collagen synthesis at a pretranslational site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In membranes, as in intact cells, sphingosine inhibited [3H]MeTRH binding by decreasing receptor affinity, but, in contrast to its effect in intact cells, did not affect the number of available binding sites. The inhibition of binding was linear up to 75 microM sphingosine (in the presence of 100 microM BSA at 0.1 mg membrane protein/ml), yielding an apparent Ki of 51 microM. Since GTP decreases the affinity for MeTRH binding in GH3 cell membranes, we studied interactions between GTP and sphingosine. While the effects of low concentrations of GTP gamma S and sphingosine were additive, sphingosine inhibition of MeTRH binding surpassed and was not affected by the addition of maximally inhibitory concentrations of GTP gamma S. Also, sphingosine (75 microM) did not affect the ability of a maximally effective dose of TRH to stimulate the low Km GTPase (vehicle, +35 +/- 5%; sphingosine, +32 +/- 10%); there was a 25% decrease in total GTPase activity in the presence of sphingosine. MeTRH binding to digitonin-solubilized receptors, which had properties similar to those described previously by others, including no effect of GTP on binding, was inhibited by sphingosine. In solubilized receptors, as in membranes, sphingosine caused a decrease in apparent affinity without changes in the number of binding sites. These data suggest that sphingosine interacts directly with the TRH receptor [or an associated factor(s) in the receptor complex] to decrease affinity by a mechanism that does not involve uncoupling of G-proteins.\r"

  ".W": "A number of compounds of pharmaceutical importance from a variety of chemical families, including thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, thiourea and derivatives, imidazoles, and various amines, were found to form charge transfer complexes with iodine. Parallel studies were carried out to investigate the actions of these drugs on lactoperoxidase and thyroid activity in vivo in the rat (assays of T3 and T4 and histology of the thyroid gland). The results showed that there was a good correlation between the value of Kc (the formation constant of the iodinated complex) and antithyroid activity in vivo. The higher the electron donor power of the compound, the higher the Kc value and the stronger the action on the thyroid. The results indicated that a number of drugs could have secondary antithyroid activity. Some compounds, such as levamisole, tetramethylthiourea, tetrahydrozoline, phenothiazines, and imipramines, with no action on peroxidase had high Kc values (tetramethylthiourea, 13,825 liters/M) and had strong antithyroid activity in the rat. These results suggest that synthetic antithyroid agents may act either on peroxidase and/or the molecular iodine which may be produced by oxidation of iodides (2I(-)----I2----2I+). It has been shown that oxidation of I- can occur in the absence of thyroglobulin. In the absence of a suitable receptor, significant amounts of I2 may, thus, accumulate. The action of such drugs on molecular iodine may have considerable pharmacological significance.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that vasopressin (VP) induces breakdown of membrane phosphoinositides in adrenal glomerulosa cells. In the present study we demonstrate that the accumulation of inositol phosphates (IP) measured in the presence of arginine vasopressin (AVP) is reduced if the cells are incubated in a calcium-free medium. This effect cannot be accounted for by modification of VP binding, reduction of inositol lipid labeling, or stimulation of inositol, 1,4,5,-triphosphate 5-monophosphatase. It mainly affects phospholipase-C activity, since this enzyme is highly sensitive to calcium. Ionomycine and nifedipine, which, respectively, increase and decrease the intracellular calcium concentration, also, respectively, stimulate and inhibit IP accumulation. In membranes prepared from pertussis toxin (IAP)-treated cells, AVP stimulates inositol monophosphate accumulation to the same extent as in membranes derived from untreated cells. However, in intact cells, IAP decreases the inositol monophosphate accumulation. This decrease probably involves calcium influx, since we show that AVP stimulates a unidirectional calcium influx, which is completely blocked by IAP treatment. In rat adrenal glomerulosa cells, the AVP-stimulated secretion of aldosterone is mainly under the control of calcium, since a full inhibition of its secretion is observed under conditions in which the calcium influxes are completely suppressed despite a sustained accumulation of IP (calcium depletion or IAP treatment). Together, these results signify that VP acts on rat glomerulosa cells by two distinct mechanisms: calcium influx, which is IAP sensitive, and phosphoinositide turnover, which is IAP insensitive.\r"

Compared to SHAM, ADX rats exhibited strong fos-like immunoreactivity (FLI) only in the parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei (PVN) 1, 3, and 7 days after surgery. Replacement with a corticosterone pellet at the time of adrenalectomy (ADX + B) prevented this increase in PVN FLI in three of four rats at 1 day, all rats at 3 days, and two of seven rats 7 days after surgery; 100 micrograms/ml corticosterone in the drinking water for 2 days before perfusion reversed ADX-induced increases in PVN FLI in 7-day ADX rats. Providing 25 micrograms/ml corticosterone in the drinking water to ADX rats for 5 days after surgery did not prevent expression of PVN FLI, even though this dose has been shown to normalize morning basal ACTH levels in ADX rats. Virtually all parvocellular PVN neurons expressing FLI after ADX costained for CRF. Some parvocellular neurons also expressed both fos and vasopressin. In all rats, many brain regions expressed FLI that was not related to adrenalectomy. We conclude that the changes in neuronal FLI correlate with demonstrated changes in neuroendocrine activity after ADX; however, suppression of ADX-induced FLI may require higher replacement levels of corticosterone than inhibition of ADX-induced ACTH secretion.\r"

Between 1500-1600 h on the day of progesterone (or blank capsule) implantation, these rats, a group of unoperated or sham controls, and a group of estrogen-progesterone-treated immature male rats were killed and perfused, and their brains processed for immunocytochemistry of c-fos antigen and LHRH. LHRH neurons consistently expressed c-fos after estrogen-progesterone treatment in females but not males; in only one of four females examined was c-fos induced after estrogen treatment. No fos was associated with LHRH neurons in the control groups. The LHRH neurons that expressed c-fos were located in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus; more rostral LHRH cells did not appear stimulated. These data demonstrate that gonadal steroids, administered in a paradigm that predictably produces timed stimulation of LH release, induce c-fos in LHRH neurons. The induction of c-fos in LHRH neurons provides a potentially useful and powerful tool for studying LHRH activation at the cellular level.\r"

Adult female rats ovariectomized for 2-3 weeks were implanted with third ventricular cannulae one week before the experiments. Silastic capsules (3 cm active surface) containing estradiol benzoate (250 micrograms/ml dissolved in sesame oil) were implanted subcutaneously two days prior to bleeding. Blood samples were collected at hourly intervals (from 1300 to 2100 h) through indwelling atrial cannulae implanted the day before the bleeding. (+) 2-amino-7-phosphoheptanoic acid (AP-7), a NMDA receptor antagonist, and 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), a non-NMDA receptor antagonist, were administered (10 and 20 nmole dissolved in 10 microliters 0.9% sodium chloride, respectively) at 1300 and 1400 h into the third ventricle. LH, FSH and PRL levels were assayed by RIA in plasma samples. AP-7 and DNQX administration completely blocked the estradiol-induced LH surge, whereas PRL and FSH secretion was not affected by the treatments. These results indicate that endogenous EAA play an important role in controlling LH secretion. Furthermore, the study reveals that both EAA receptor types; i.e. NMDA and non-NMDA, appear to be necessary for the physiological mechanism(s) triggering the estradiol-induced LH surge.\r"

After a transitory ovarian stimulation at the onset of treatment, serum estradiol was suppressed to menopausal levels (50 pg/mL). This state of hypogonadism was reversible after the discontinuation of treatment, and menses resumed within 4 months after the last injection. Pelvic pain was relieved during treatment in 87.5% of patients. After a follow-up period of up to 37 months, 24 patients are in clinical remission and 9 experienced recurrence of endometriosis 7 to 14 months after completing treatment. One patient failed to respond to therapy with the agonist and 7 patients were lost to follow-up. Among 16 previously infertile patients with no other factors contributing to infertility, 7 became pregnant; 2 of these pregnancies were the result of gamete intrafallopian transfers. An eighth patient without documented infertility also conceived spontaneously. Side effects due to hypoestrogenism were reported by nearly all patients. In conclusion, D-Trp6-LH-RH microcapsules are effective and easily-administered agents for the treatment of endometriosis.\r"

Medical therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist plus an antiandrogen resulted in reversal of the hirsutism, yet with preservation of potential fertility. In response to luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone suppression, there was normalization of the serum androgens, but not of the hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperprolactinemia, hypertension, or acanthosis nigricans. Conclusions: (1) This syndrome may be familial. (2) Medical therapy for the virilization is successful. (3) The hyperandrogenemia is primarily LH dependent and not primarily insulin dependent, although insulin may have an amplification effect. (4) Hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperprolactinemia, and the hypertension are not androgen dependent.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the usefulness of a new drug regimen in an assisted conception program, a trial was performed comparing clomiphene citrate (CC) plus human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) with a new regimen of intranasal luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analog plus hMG. One hundred two patient cycles received treatment with CC and hMG and 118 patient cycles received treatment with LH-RH analog and hMG. Fifteen percent of cycles were canceled in the CC group and 8% in the analog group. Four percent of cycles in the CC group were canceled due to premature ovulation. The number of oocytes collected in the analog group was significantly higher than in the CC group (8.5 versus 5.5), as was the number of mature oocytes (3.5 versus 2.7). However, the percentage of mature oocytes was higher in the CC group (54.2% versus 42.3%). The number of embryos resulting from in vitro fertilization as well as the number of cleaving embryos were significantly higher in the analog group (5.2 versus 2.8 and 4.6 versus 2.3, respectively). The pregnancy rate in the analog group was significantly higher than in the CC group (30.6% versus 16.1%), as was the live birth rate (21% versus 8%). Early pregnancy loss was significantly higher in the CC group than in the analog group (35% versus 9%); and the serum level of LH on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration was also significantly elevated in the CC group when compared with the analog group (8.1 versus 4.1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Leuprolide acetate was begun on day 1 of the cycle in one group (n = 20), on day 3 in another (n = 48), and the third control group (n = 88) did not receive the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Human menopausal gonadotropin was initiated on day 3 in all groups. Peak estradiol (E2) levels and the mean numbers of mature oocytes and embryos transferred per cycle were significantly greater in the day 3 group than in either the day 1 or control groups. Patients who received the day 3 protocol had significantly fewer cancelled cycles. A decline in E2 was observed on the third day of analog administration in certain patients, particularly those on the day 1 protocol. Follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels increased two- to fivefold 24 hours after initiation of the analog. Thereafter the gonadotropin levels fell, but nevertheless remained above those of controls for most of the cycle. Hence, it appears that enhanced follicular growth attributed to the early transient rises in gonadotropins can be coupled to a suppression of endogenous LH surges in leuprolide-treated women. These beneficial effects seem to be more likely to occur if leuprolide is initiated on cycle day 3 rather than day 1.\r"

The stimulated cycles showed a mean peak estradiol of 443 +/- 173 pg/mL, mean days of human chorionic gonadotropin of 7.6 +/- 1.4, 2.67 +/- 1.5 preovulatory oocytes per retrieval, and 2.56 +/- 1.3 oocytes per transfer. Three clinical pregnancies resulted after 25 embryo transfer cycles (12%). With paired analysis, we compared 8 patient cycles with prior six ampules of FSH stimulation starting on day 3; all parameters examined showed no significant differences. In a comparison of 22 patient cycles with prior 4 ampules of FSH stimulation on cycle day 3, no significant differences in any parameters were observed except in the higher number of ampules used in the present study. We conclude that high-dose FSH stimulation at the onset of the menstrual cycle does not improve the IVF outcome in low-responder patients.\r"

Common factors associated with the development of OHSS were high serum estradiol values on the day of ovulation induction and many follicles greater than or equal to 12 mm. Based on this experience, a new therapeutic schedule was used in a group of 10 patients who, after GnRH-a and gonadotropin stimulation, were judged to be at high risk of OHSS on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). No hCG was administered and gonadotropins were stopped. The administration of GnRH-a was continued and, after a further period of pituitary desensitization, follicular stimulation was recommended with a lower dose of gonadotropins. No cases of OHSS occurred and 3 patients became pregnant.\r"

We found no significant difference in triploidy when cycles were stimulated with clomiphene citrate/human menopausal gonadotropin (3.2%) compared with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog/human menopausal gonadotropin stimulation (4.4%). Triploidy was less common with male factor infertility (0.7%) compared with other causes of infertility (3.4% to 3.8%). Triploid embryos can develop to cleavage stages indistinguishable from those generated by diploid embryos.

  ".U": "90169319\r", 
  ".W": "Because insulin shows an antinatriuretic effect in healthy humans, insulin therapy resulting in circulating hyperinsulinemia may lead to sodium retention and in turn to hypertension in individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Moreover, it has been proved that atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) plays a major role in modulating natriuresis in humans. This study investigated the relationship between insulin and ANP in modulating sodium metabolism in normotensive and hypertensive IDDM subjects compared with control groups of normotensive and hypertensive nondiabetic subjects. IDDM normotensive and hypertensive subjects had mean +/- SE duration of IDDM of 7 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 2 yr, respectively, and had no clinical features of diabetic nephropathy. All subjects received a saline infusion (2 mmol.kg-1.90 min-1) during euglycemia. IDDM normotensive and hypertensive subjects received a subcutaneous insulin infusion (15 mU.kg-1.h-1), resulting in twofold higher plasma free-insulin levels (16 +/- 2 and 19 +/- 3 microU/ml, respectively) than in nondiabetic normotensive and hypertensive subjects (7 +/- 2 and 8 +/- 2 microU/ml, respectively). During saline challenge, sodium excretion increased by 22 +/- 4% in normotensive and 49 +/- 9% in hypertensive nondiabetic subjects but by only 11 +/- 0.4% in normotensive (P less than 0.01) and 8 +/- 2% in hypertensive (P less than 0.01) IDDM subjects. The impaired natriuretic response to saline challenge was mainly due to greater rates of sodium reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules in IDDM than nondiabetic subjects. At baseline, plasma ANP concentrations were significantly higher in both IDDM groups than in control groups (normotensive IDDM and control subjects: 38 +/- 4 and 19 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively, P less than 0.01; hypertensive IDDM and control subjects: 45 +/- 6 and 27 +/- 4 pg/ml, respectively, P less than 0.05). After saline challenge, ANP concentrations rose to 39 +/- 4 pg/ml in normotensive and 49 +/- 5 pg/ml in hypertensive control subjects, whereas no significant change above baseline value was seen in IDDM subjects. Both IDDM groups showed a 10-12% greater exchangeable Na+ pool than control subjects regardless of the presence of hypertension. Subcutaneous insulin infusion, resulting in circulating plasma free-insulin levels in normotensive control subjects comparable to those in IDDM patients, inhibited natriuresis, increased proximal tubule sodium reabsorption at the level of the kidney, and inhibited an adequate ANP stimulation by saline challenge. We conclude that hyperinsulinemia leads to increased proximal tubule sodium reabsorption and impaired ANP response during saline administration. Both mechanisms account for sodium retention in normotensive and hypertensive IDDM patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluated UV as an immunomodulator of canine islets. The effects of UV irradiation on islet secretory function in vitro revealed a trend of increasing basal insulin release with increasing doses of UV and a corresponding significant decrease in glucose-mediated insulin release (expressed as percentage of basal fractional insulin release) beginning at UV light exposures of 200-300 J/m2 (n = 3, P less than 0.05). Proliferative responses to UV-irradiated allogeneic peripheral blood leukocytes and islets were significantly decreased by 53-112% (P less than 0.05) in 27 of 29 mixed-lymphocyte cultures and by 35-74% (P less than 0.05) in 4 of 5 mixed-lymphocyte islet culture experiments, respectively, beginning at 200-600 J/m2. Autotransplantation of nonirradiated (n = 8) and irradiated islets (600 J/m2, n = 6) resulted in a 1-mo graft survival rate of 75% for the control group and 50% for the irradiated group. Allotransplantation of irradiated islets (600 J/m2) into either nonimmunosuppressed recipients (1 donor to 1 recipient, n = 8) or recipients of subimmunosuppressive doses of cyclosporin (2 donors to 1 recipient, n = 4) resulted in 100% rejection by day 10. In contrast, when islets were cultured for 24 h postirradiation and transplanted into cyclosporin-treated pancreatectomized recipients (2 donors to 1 recipient), 3 of 7 grafts were prolonged beyond day 10 to days 16, 26, and greater than 100.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess the reversibility of diabetes-induced increases in regional vascular albumin permeation and blood flow and changes in kidney filtration function, islet isografts were given via the portal vein after 2 mo of streptozocin-induced diabetes in male Lewis rats. One month later, vascular function was assessed in control rats, islet-transplanted diabetic rats, and untreated diabetic rats (6-9 rats/group). Untreated diabetic rats were markedly hyperglycemic, hyperphagic, and polyuric. Transplanted rats were euglycemic within 6 days; 24-h urine volumes were virtually normalized by 2 wk and food consumption was normalized 4 wk after transplantation. Vascular albumin permeation in diabetic rats was significantly increased 1.4- to 1.7-fold in anterior uvea, choroid, retina, sciatic nerve, new granulation tissue, and kidney and was increased 1.1- to 1.3-fold in diaphragm, cecum, and optic nerve. Albumin permeation was not increased in aorta, brain, heart, or forelimb skeletal muscle. Islet transplants significantly reduced but did not completely normalize vascular albumin permeation in most tissues in which it was increased by diabetes but had no effect on albumin permeation in optic nerve, sciatic nerve, and diaphragm. Urinary excretion of endogenous albumin and IgG in diabetic rats was significantly increased 19- and 14-fold, respectively, and was virtually normalized 4 days after islet transplantation. Marked (1.8-fold) increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic rats were also substantially reduced by islet transplants but remained elevated 1.4-fold control values. Likewise, diabetes-induced increases in regional blood flow were reduced in general but not normalized by islet transplants. These observations indicate that 1) diabetes-induced hemodynamic changes and alterations in vascular filtration function are not rapidly reversed by euglycemia after islet transplantation, 2) diabetes-induced increases in urinary albumin and IgG excretion are more readily normalized by euglycemia than increases in GFR and renal 125I-labeled bovine serum albumin (125I-BSA) filtration, and 3) significant increases in GFR and renal 125I-BSA filtration may not be manifested by albuminuria.\r"

This enzyme is localized primarily in the cytoplasm of the endothelial and Kupffer cells; some activity is associated with the parenchymal cells. Levels of this enzyme accurately predicted the extent of ischemia and reperfusion damage to the microvascular endothelial cell of the liver. Livers from Lewis rats were subjected to 30, 45 and 60 min of warm (37 degrees C) no flow ischemia that was followed by a standard reperfusion period lasting 45 min. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase was measured at the end of the no flow ischemia and reperfusion periods as was superoxide generation (O2-). Bile production was monitored throughout the no flow ischemia and reperfusion periods. Control perfusions were carried out for 120 min. A significant rise in purine nucleoside phosphorylase levels as compared with controls was observed at the end of ischemia in all the three groups. The highest level, 203.5 +/- 29.2 mU/ml, was observed after 60 min of ischemia. After the reperfusion period, levels of purine nucleoside phosphorylase decreased in the 30- and 45-min groups 58.17 +/- 9.66 mU/ml and 67.5 +/- 17.1 mU/ml, respectively. These levels were equal to control perfusions. In contrast, after 60 min of ischemia, levels of purine nucleoside phosphorylase decreased early in the reperfusion period and then rose to 127.8 +/- 14.8 mU/ml by the end of reperfusion (p less than 0.0001).

  ".U": "90169843\r", 
  ".W": "Controversy exists concerning the localization of the enzyme Na+,K(+)-ATPase to canalicular membranes in hepatocytes. Most studies find enzyme activity only at the basolateral plasma membrane domain of the hepatocyte. However, Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity has been detected recently in a canalicular membrane fraction prepared by Mg++ precipitation, suggesting that differences in membrane domain fluidity account for these discrepancies. To reinvestigate this question, we used free-flow electrophoresis to further purify canalicular liver plasma membranes originally separated by sucrose density centrifugation. With this technique, canalicular membranes devoid of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity by routine assay were separated into six subfractions. More than 80% of the activities of canalicular marker enzymes was recovered in two subfractions closest to the anode, which were totally devoid of Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. However, Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity could now be detected in the four other fractions that contained only small amounts of canalicular marker enzymes. The basolateral marker enzyme, glucagon-stimulated adenyl cyclase, comigrated with this cryptic Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. Furthermore, addition of 6 mumol/L [12-(2-methoxyethoxy)-ethyl-8-(cis-2-n-octylcyclopropyl)-octanoate ], a membrane-fluidizing agent, to the original canalicular membrane preparation and to all subfractions did not stimulate or unmask latent Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity. Finally, when canalicular membranes isolated by Mg++ precipitation were subjected to free-flow electrophoresis, they could not be separated from the more positively charged Na+,K(+)-ATPase-containing fractions, probably because of alterations in surface charge. Together these findings suggest that Na+,K(+)-ATPase is a basolateral enzyme, that represents a small contaminant when present in canalicular liver plasma membranes and that methodological differences may account for previous discrepancies.\r"

As baby-boomers age and become debilitated with chronic disease and conditions, and as premature babies and young trauma and chronic disease victims survive with increased disability, acute care hospital administrators will have to focus more attention on these patients. But what is this patient population like? One of the steps to understanding the chronic care market is to form a realistic profile of these patients, say executives. They are not all elderly, and they are not all near death. But they are savvy consumers who demand high-quality, patient-centered care.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanisms by which small changes in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) affect aldosterone, 10 normal young men were infused for 2 h with 0.6 pmol/kg.min human [Ser,Tyr28]ANH under 3 study conditions: 1) high salt diet (H), 2) low salt diet (L), and 3) low salt diet plus pretreatment with the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (LE). Baseline ANH levels were higher on H than on L or LE. A postural drop in ANH was observed when subjects went from standing to sitting. Plasma ANH levels increased during infusion by up to 4.5 pmol/L (H, 7.0 +/- 1.3 to 11.5 +/- 1.4; L, 4.3 +/- 0.6 to 8.7 +/- 1.1; LE, 4.2 +/- 0.5 to 8.6 +/- 1.5). At all time points, plasma ANH was well within the normal range. Plasma aldosterone did not change during H, decreased by about 60% for both low salt conditions, and remained suppressed at 1 h of recovery for L, but not for LE. This suggests that ANH can suppress aldosterone by both indirect and direct mechanisms, although the indirect mechanism appears to predominate. A prompt increase in urine flow was seen during ANH infusion and was sustained at 1 h of recovery, but little change was seen in urinary sodium or potassium excretion, heart rate, or blood pressure. The difference between the natriuretic and diuretic effects of ANH was seen under all conditions. These results support the hypothesis that within the normal physiological range, ANH is a regulator of salt and water metabolism in normal man.\r"

  ".W": "In the human granulomatous disease sarcoidosis hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria result from the endogenous overproduction of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] by the disease-activated macrophage. Unlike the renal 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25OHD)-1-hydroxylase, normally the sole synthetic source of the hormone in man, the 25OHD3-1-hydroxylation reaction in cultured pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAM) from patients with sarcoidosis is subject to stimulation by the immune cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and inhibition by the antiinflammatory glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The data presented here suggest that IFN gamma and calcium ionophore A23187 promote enhanced expression of the sarcoid PAM 25OHD3-1-hydroxylation reaction by increasing endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Dexamethasone, an inhibitor of the cellular phospholipase-A2-arachidonic acid-generating system, and BW755C, a lipoxygenase pathway inhibitor, inhibited PAM 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis by 64% and 54%, respectively. Conversely, leukotriene C4, a distal metabolite in the arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase pathway, increased the hydroxylation reaction by 234% and restored dexamethasone-inhibited PAM 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthetic activity. The results of this study provide presumptive evidence for an important role of agonist (IFN gamma)-calcium-modulated eicosanoid metabolism in the regulated synthesis of 1,25-(OH)2D by PAM in sarcoidosis.\r"

The serum bio-FSH was measured by the granulosa cell aromatase bioassay. The basal serum bio-FSH levels were not significantly different in patients with central precocious puberty (6.4 +/- 1.5 IU/L), premature thelarche (7.5 +/- 0.5 IU/L), and prepubertal controls (4.4 +/- 0.7 IU/L). However, the peak responses of both serum immuno- and bio-FSH levels to iv GnRH were higher in patients with premature thelarche (immuno-FSH, 29.3 +/- 2.3 IU/L; bio-FSH, 100.7 +/- 12.2 IU/L) than in those with central precocious puberty [immuno-FSH, 17.5 +/- 3.1 IU/L (p less than 0.05); bio-FSH, 42.4 +/- 9.8 IU/L (p less than 0.01)]. This suggests that in children with premature thelarche, there is a predominant immuno- as well as bio-FSH response to GnRH. After 12 months of GnRH agonist therapy, both serum immuno- and bio-FSH levels were suppressed in patients with central precocious puberty. The differences in clinical presentation between central precocious puberty and premature thelarche cannot be explained by the differences in FSH bioactivity.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids inhibit prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in several cell types, presumably by inhibiting arachidonic acid (AA) deacylation from phospholipids. We studied the effects of glucocorticoids on cultured term human amnion cell AA release. Confluent monolayer cultures of amnion cells were adapted to serum-free medium, and phospholipids were labeled for 18 h with [14C]AA. The calcium ionophore A23187 (0.2-5.0 mumol/L) stimulated [14C]AA release (up to 2.2-fold) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The apparent sources of the liberated [14C]AA were phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Pretreatment for 24 h with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (0.1-1000 nmol/L) significantly inhibited (P less than 0.01) basal (unstimulated) [14C]AA release by 69% in subsequent 1-h experiments. The sole apparent source of free [14C]AA during this inhibitory state was phosphatidylethanolamine. Dexamethasone pretreatment slightly inhibited (13%; P less than 0.05) calcium ionophore-stimulated [14C]AA release; however, it was still 3.8-fold greater than basal release, suggesting that the glucocorticoid effect on stimulated AA release was not biologically relevant. Further characterization of the glucocorticoid effect revealed that preincubation of the cultures with dexamethasone for as little as 20 min inhibited basal [14C]AA release. Furthermore, studies involving actinomycin-D and cycloheximide demonstrated that inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis failed to block the glucocorticoid inhibition of basal AA liberation. The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU 38486, alone or in the presence of dexamethasone, also inhibited unstimulated [14C]AA release. Cortisol, dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate, 17 beta-estradiol, and progesterone all inhibited basal [14C]AA liberation. We conclude that glucocorticoids inhibit unstimulated AA release from cultured amnion cells, but do not prevent calcium ionophore from stimulating a large increase in AA release.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It remains controversial, however, whether hyperandrogenism directly decreases insulin action. Hence, we performed 2-h euglycemic glucose (approximately 772 pmol/L steady state insulin levels) clamps in nine PCO women with insulin resistance basally and after the 12th week of therapy with a superagonist GnRH analog (40 micrograms every 8 h, sc). Diet, activity, and weight were kept constant. Despite significant decreases in plasma testosterone and androstenedione levels (both P less than 0.05), there was no significant change in insulin-mediated glucose disposal, plasma insulin levels, or hepatic glucose production. The sample size was adequate to detect a clinically significant change in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal (i.e. approximately 3.3 mumol/kg.min; P less than or equal to 0.05). We conclude that suppressing androgen levels into the normal range did not result in significant changes in insulin resistance in PCO. Thus, controlling hyperandrogenemia is not a clinically effective modality to improve insulin action and thereby decrease the risk of noninsulin-dependent diabetes in PCO.\r"

The present study was performed to investigate the role of acetylcholine in regulating GH secretion by using pirenzepine, which selectively blocks muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Paired tests were performed in nine anorexia nervosa patients (age +/- SEM, 19.1 +/- 1.2 yr; percent ideal body weight, -32.7 +/- 2.2%) and in six normal controls (20.1 +/- 0.3 yr; -3.1 +/- 1.8%). GHRH-(1-44) (1 microgram/kg) was infused iv with and without pirenzepine pretreatment (0.6 mg/kg, iv). Basal levels of GH were not different in anorexia nervosa compared to normal controls, whereas, somatomedin-C levels were significantly lower in anorexia nervosa patients. However, after pirenzepine administration, the GHRH-stimulated GH responses were completely blocked in normal controls, but not in anorexia nervosa patients. These results suggested that altered muscarinic cholinergic mechanism are involved in the modulation of GH secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa.\r"

Previous studies have failed to elucidate the molecular defect in individuals with complete TBG deficiency (TBG-CD). Indeed, no major deletions, insertions, or other rearrangements were observed in the TBG gene of six unrelated males with this defect. To clarify the molecular basis of TBG-CD, we have cloned and sequenced the TBG gene of an affected male (CD5) of French Canadian origin. The sequence of the exons encoding the mature protein, adjacent introns, and the promoter region revealed two nucleotide substitutions: CTA(Leu)----CCA(Pro) at codon 227 and TTG(Leu)----TTT(Phe) at codon 283. The Leu----Phe substitution, a relatively conservative replacement, is a TBG polymorphism present in 16% (3 of 19) of French Canadian males. It has no effect on the serum concentration or properties of the common type TBG (TBG-C). The new Leu----Pro substitution, which is predicted to alter the higher order of TBG structure, is probably responsible for the TBG-CD phenotype of the individual studied and two other families with TBG-CD. It possibly impairs TBG biosynthesis or secretion or perhaps alters TBG structure to such a degree that the molecule is not recognized by antibodies against native or denatured TBG and does not bind T4.\r"

Clinical situations may dictate the use of specific amino acid formulations. Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) solutions may normalize aberrant amino acid profiles in patients with hepatic encephalopathy; however, controlled trials demonstrate little effect on clinical outcome, and the effectiveness in patients with acute liver failure or undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation is unproved. BCAA solutions have also been tried in septic and severely stressed patients with equivocal results. Renal failure has been treated with essential amino acid solutions, yet low-dose standard amino acid formulations are probably equally effective. Pediatric preparations have been tailored to \"normalize\" amino acid profiles to those of healthy term, breast-fed neonates. Recent studies suggest that premature infants receiving these formulations may achieve intrauterine growth rates, although the effect on long-term outcome is unknown. Glutamine may be essential for the preservation of intestinal mucosal structure and function; further study is indicated to determine the necessity of adding glutamine to parenteral amino acid solutions. Recently, amino acid infusions have been associated with enhanced ventilatory drive, possibly via stimulation of central ventilatory mechanisms. A variety of other side effects have been documented, including acidosis, hyperammonemia, hypercalciuria, and possibly bone disease and hepatotoxicity. Further understanding of the metabolism of intravenous infusion of amino acids is necessary to provide optimal nutritional protein support. Because full information regarding the complex effects of intravenous substrates is lacking, special amino acid formulations must be used with caution.\r"

The responses to each determinant after hen egg-white lysozyme immunization were not equal and in examining the mice as a group some determinants tended to be dominant. However, despite each animal favoring a restricted number of determinants, the responding T cell populations were still highly heterogeneous. The data suggest that many determinants are involved in the response to the whole Ag. The role of one or more dominant determinants can be overestimated because the degree of heterogeneity in long term T cell lines appears to be less than in freshly obtained lymph node cells, indicating that a process of in vitro selection occurs.

  ".U": "90171549\r", 
  ".W": "The ability to express the growth hormone IL-2 upon stimulation gives T lymphocytes one of their major effector functions in the immune system. IL-2 is apparently synthesized only by T cells, and only by a subset of T cells which constitutes a \"helper\" class. It remains unknown how and when the IL-2-producing lineage becomes distinct from other functional effector lineages. We have therefore examined immature T cell precursors to determine when IL-2 inducibility is acquired in relation to other maturation events, such as expression of an Ag-binding TCR, which is suspected to play an influential role in the determination of subclass commitment. In mature T cells, IL-2 is inducible via agonists of the phosphoinositide pathway, a network of signaling mediators shared by a wide variety of metazoan cell types. The universality of this activation pathway makes it seem less likely, a priori, to be a target of developmental change than the intrinsic susceptibility to induction of the IL-2 locus. However, our results presented here refute this expectation. In this report, we show that both TCR+ cells and pre-T cells too immature to express TCR can be induced to express IL-2 at high levels. The induction requirements for IL-2 expression, however, are different in TCR- and TCR+ cells. Even by using Ca2+ ionophore and phorbol ester to bypass the requirement for the TCR in cell activation, the TCR- cells also require the presence of the polypeptide hormone IL-1. By contrast, TCR+ mature cells not only can express IL-2 without IL-1, but also show no response to IL-1 when Ca2+ ionophore and phorbol ester are present. IL-1-dependent IL-2 producers appear in the thymus of repopulating radiation chimeras before \"mature\" (TCR+) T cells, whereas IL-1-independent IL-2 production is found only afterward. Thus, IL-2 inducibility per se apparently precedes TCR expression and all TCR-associated fate determination events. However, developmental alteration of signal transduction pathways may play a vital regulatory role in the later allocation of particular functional responses to appropriate lineages of T cells.\r"

In our studies, we determined the molecular target on the stimulating anti-Id antibody that is recognized by the Th clone. The Th clone responds with proliferation to the H chain of 3A4 but not to the L chain. Furthermore, the 3A4 chain stimulates this Th clone more efficiently than either the intact 3A4 or the Fab fragments, and the presentation by APC of the H chain is more resistant to chloroquine treatment than the presentation of the intact 3A4 molecule. These results suggest that regulatory T cells \"see\" their target idiotopes as linear sequence determinants present on isolated Ig chains, and show that this might have biologic advantages with respect to the mechanism of Ag presentation.\r"

In this report we present two lines of evidence for the existence of additional Th differentiation states. Lectin-stimulated spleen cells secreted moderate levels of IL-2 compared with long term Th1 clones, whereas the levels of other cytokines were more than 100-fold lower than those produced by either Th1 or Th2 clones. This suggests that many spleen cells produce substantial amounts of IL-2 but little or no IL-4, IL-5, IFN-gamma, IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage-CSF. In contrast to long term Th clones, many short term alloreactive clones displayed cytokine secretion phenotypes intermediate between the Th1 and Th2 patterns. The proportion of recognizable Th1 and Th2 clones at early times in culture was greatly increased by immunization of the mice from which the responder and stimulator cells were derived; Brucella abortus immunization resulted in the isolation of exclusively Th1 clones, whereas infection with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis resulted in a strong trend toward the isolation of Th2 clones. The immunization of mice from which responder cells were derived strongly affected the type of Th clone obtained, whereas the source of stimulator cells had much less effect, suggesting that the commitment of Th cells to the Th1 or Th2 phenotypes occurred mainly in vivo. A model for the possible relationships of the various Th cells is presented.\r"

Four Ag recognized by AMA have been recently identified, including protein X and the acyltransferases of three related multienzyme complexes: the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC), the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex, and the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Each of these enzymes contains one or more lipoyl moieties as part of a major functional site. In addition, epitope mapping has suggested that the AMA target is this lipoic acid-binding region. In this report we demonstrate that sera from patients with PBC also recognize the E1 component (pyruvate dehydrogenase, EC 1.2.4.1) of PDC. PDC-E1 is composed of alpha and beta-chains. Reactivity with the 41 kD alpha chain was detected in 80 of 120 (66%) PBC sera by immunoblotting against purified PDC-E1; 2 of 120 sera also demonstrated reactivity with the 34 kD beta chain. In contrast, sera from patients with SLE, chronic active hepatitis, or progressive sclerosing cholangitis as well as sera from healthy volunteers did not react with PDC-E1. Furthermore, affinity-purified PBC sera against PDC-E1 alpha were able to inhibit PDC enzyme activity, whereas control sera could not. PDC-E1 alpha is now the fifth mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC to be identified. Similar to the four previously identified autoantigens, AMA appear to be directed to a functional site of PDC-E1 alpha inasmuch as they are able to inhibit enzyme function. However, PDC-E1 alpha is also unique in that it is the first identified mitochondrial autoantigen which does not contain lipoic acid.\r"

T cell lines from two immunized animals responded to p24: Ty-VLP, control Ty-VLP, purified p24, and whole inactivated HIV, indicating the presence of T cells specific for p24 as well as the Ty carrier protein. The HIV determinants recognized by the T cell lines were identified by using a series of overlapping peptides synthesized according to the sequence of p24. Both T cell lines recognized peptide 11 (amino acids 235-249) and peptide 14 (amino acids 265-279). In addition, one T cell line also responded to peptide 9 (amino acids 215-229). Definitive identification of two T cell epitopes on p24 was confirmed at the clonal level: from a total of four T cell clones generated from one of the T cell lines, two respond specifically to peptide 11 and two to peptide 14. The T cell clones were CD4+ and MHC class II-restricted and secreted IL-2 in response to stimulation with purified p24, inactivated HIV or a single synthetic peptide. The specificity of the Th clones for variant peptides demonstrated cross-reactivity with two simian immunodeficiency virus isolates, but only limited responses to HIV-2 sequences. However, the Th cell epitopes identified on p24 are highly conserved between 12 HIV-1 isolates and were recognized by both of the immunized primates. These sequences may therefore be useful for priming a broadly reactive immune response to HIV-1.\r"

Oral administration of the SAg molecule prevented or markedly diminished the clinical appearance of SAg-induced disease as measured by ocular inflammation. Furthermore, oral administration of the SAg also markedly diminished uveitis induced by the uveitogenic M and N fragments of the SAg. M and N fragments were not effective in preventing SAg-induced EAU, although feeding the M fragment prevented disease induced by the M fragment. Oral administration of the SAg did not prevent myelin basic protein induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas feeding myelin basic protein did. In vitro studies demonstrated a significant decrease in proliferative responses to the SAg in lymph node cells draining the site of immunization from fed vs nonfed animals. Furthermore, the addition of splenocytes from SAg-fed animals to cultures of a CD4+ SAg-specific cell line profoundly suppressed the cell line's response to the SAg, whereas these splenocytes had no effect on a purified protein derivative-specific cell line. The Ag-specific in vitro suppression was blocked by anti-CD8 antibody (OX-8) demonstrating that this suppression is dependent on CD8+ T-cells. These experiments demonstrate that Ag-specific immunomanipulation can be achieved in the EAU model by oral administration of the SAg and raise the possibility that such an approach may have practical clinical implications in uveitis as well as other human autoimmune diseases.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines the potential mechanism(s) responsible for the defective clonability of CD8+ T lymphocytes in patients with AIDS. By the combined use of one- and two-color fluorescence cytofluorometry we have shown an increase in the number of circulating DR+ cells due to the expression of DR on a relatively large proportion of T lymphocytes (one-third of CD3+ cells), the majority of them belonging to the CD8+ subset. In addition, the majority of CD8+DR+ cells in AIDS patients did not express CD25 Ag (the receptor for IL-2), a surface marker generally expressed on normal activated T lymphocytes. Sorted CD8+DR+ and CD8+DR- cell populations were analyzed comparatively for their ability to proliferate in response to different stimuli, including anti-CD3, anti-CD2, alone or in combination with anti-CD28 mAb and mitogens such as PHA, alone or in combination with PMA. We have demonstrated that CD8+DR+ cells were severely defective in their proliferative response to triggering via these major pathways of T cell activation even when an exogenous source of IL-2 or IL-4 was added to the microcultures 24 h after initiating the cultures. In contrast, CD8+DR- cells showed a significant proliferation in response to the different stimuli and the proliferative response was strongly enhanced by the addition of IL-2 or IL-4. At the end of the stimulation period CD8+DR+ and CD8+DR- proliferating populations were analyzed for CD25 Ag expression. Only 1 to 10% of CD8+DR+ cells expressed CD25 antigen compared with 40 to 50% of CD8+DR- cells. The proliferative defect of CD8+DR+ cells was further confirmed in experiments performed at the clonal level. The analysis of the frequency of proliferating T lymphocyte-precursors in both CD8+DR+ and CD8+DR- subsets showed that the defective clonogenic potential of CD8+ cells in AIDS patients could be in large part ascribed to CD8+DR+ cells. Five percent of CD8+DR+ cells showed a clonogenic potential compared to the 25% of CD8+DR- cells. Finally, we analyzed the surface expression of VLA-2 Ag, a marker of a chronic state of T cell activation, on circulating T lymphocytes. We have shown that a large proportion of CD3+DR+CD25- cells (50 to 80% in the different patients with AIDS analyzed) expressed VLA-2 Ag.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

CD8+ clones synthesized IFN-gamma and lymphotoxin at levels similar to Th1 clones, whereas IL-2 was synthesized by only 50% of the clones and at significantly lower levels compared to Th1 clones. CD8+ clones also produced substantial amounts of granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, TY5, P500, and TNF-alpha which are expressed preferentially by Th1 clones and at lower levels by Th2 clones. The level of IL-3 produced by CD8+ clones was approximately 10% of that produced by Th1 and Th2 clones. Some CD8+ clones expressed low levels of the Th2-preferential product preproenkelphalin. None of the CD8+ clones expressed detectable levels of the Th2-specific products IL-4, IL-5, and P600, and the great majority did not express IL-6. The cytokine profile of CD8+ clones is representative of that secreted by activated normal CD8+ splenocytes, which includes IFN-gamma, low levels of IL-2 and IL-3 but no IL-4 or IL-5. Inasmuch as many Th1/Th2 functions are cytokine mediated, the striking similarity of the Th1 and CD8+ cytokine secretion patterns helps to explain why these two cell types share certain functions such as DTH, and also suggests that further common functions may be discovered in the future.\r"

Human IFN-gamma (huIFN-gamma) does not ordinarily act on murine cells because it fails to bind to murine cell surface receptors. However, when huIFN-gamma was microinjected into murine macrophages, a time and dose-dependent induction of Ia was detected by autoradiography on the surface of injected and neighboring cells. These results imply a direct role for internalized IFN-gamma and show that huIFN-gamma, although it fails to be recognized by murine cell surface receptors, can act internally on murine cells. The effect on Ia gene expression induced by microinjected huIFN-gamma was in part indirect: granulocyte/macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) was released by IFN-gamma-injected macrophages, and this secondary mediator appeared to induce Ia on neighboring cells, inasmuch as anti-GM-CSF blocked Ia induction. Anti-GM-CSF also partially blocked Ia induction by extracellular murine IFN-gamma on murine macrophages. Thus, at least some of the Ia induction attributed to IFN-gamma was mediated by GM-CSF.\r"

Two cytokines: IL-4 (in the presence of PMA) and IL-7 have been shown to induce immature fetal thymocyte proliferation. It has also been suggested that IL-2 plays an important role in fetal T cell development. In this report, we investigated the effects of several cytokines (known to be growth factors for T-lineage cells) on fetal thymocyte proliferation. Our results indicate that: 1) TNF-alpha and a newly described cytokine, P40, enhance fetal thymocyte proliferation stimulated by IL-2 (but not IL-4 or IL-7). 2) The enhancement induced by P40 is not mediated by TNF-alpha because blocking antibodies against this cytokine failed to inhibit this response. 3) IL-4 inhibits fetal thymocyte proliferation in response to TNF-alpha + IL-2 or to IL-7 but not to P40 + IL-2. Finally, 4) the proliferating cells to all cytokine combinations used were Thy-1+. These observations suggest that these cytokine combinations induce independent pathways of T cell proliferation in the developing thymus.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of lymphokine RNA induction and secretion of biologically active lymphokine from CD4-enriched splenic T cell populations was investigated. Cells stimulated immediately after isolation from murine spleen (\"fresh\" T cells) and cells restimulated after 4 days of in vitro culture (\"primed\" T cells) were compared. Northern blot analysis and bioassays were used to analyze and quantitate production of eight lymphokines and the IL-2R. Fresh T cells produced high levels of IL-2 and low to moderate levels of IL-3, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, and IFN-gamma. In vitro primed T cells produced IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, granulocyte/macrophage-CSF, IFN-gamma, and high levels of IL-2R RNA. Comparison of RNA levels and bioassays of supernatants from these populations indicated that primed T cells produced at least 10-fold more of six of the lymphokines than fresh T cells. Only IL-2 was produced in near equal amounts by fresh and primed T cells. There were also marked differences in the kinetics of lymphokine production by fresh and primed CD4+ T cells. After restimulation with Con A and PMA, primed cells produced a short burst of lymphokine RNA that peaked between 7.5 and 13 h and declined after 18 h. Fresh T cells lagged in the initial production of lymphokine RNA, with levels peaking 18 to 44 h after mitogenic stimulation. Depletion of CD4+ cells indicated that cells of helper phenotype were responsible for the majority of lymphokine production from the primed cells. Thus different subpopulations of Th cells defined by their respective ability to respond either directly (fresh T cells) or only after culture and restimulation (primed T cells) show different patterns of lymphokine gene regulation. Other studies suggest that the activity of \"fresh\" Th cells is due to a population with a \"memory\" phenotype, while the cells which require culture have a \"precursor\" phenotype. These distinct patterns of lymphokine gene regulation in the two populations of Th cells may account in part for differences seen in the kinetics and magnitude of the naive and memory immune responses which are regulated by Th cells.\r"

These mAb were tested for reactivity to a number of \"self\" and foreign Ag. Binding that could be detected only at nM mAb concentrations or less was considered significant. We found that a surprisingly high number of the mAb bound one or more of the Ag tested, and many mAb bound more than a single Ag. Ag-induced mAb were likewise tested and found to have greatly reduced cross-reactivities. We found no significant differences, either in frequency of Ag binding or degree of cross-reactivity, between normal and autoimmune mice. Furthermore, the frequency with which a given Ag was bound by our panel of mAb was found to be proportional to the size of the Ag. The frequency with which individual VH gene families were expressed by our panel was consistent with a stochastic usage of VH genes in the preimmune repertoire. We interpret these data as showing that the preimmune repertoire is highly cross-reactive and that the activation of autoreactive clones in autoimmune animals is due to a defect in cellular regulation rather than a difference in repertoire.\r"

However, when the cell suspensions were stimulated with both AA and A23187, the cells produced HHT, leukotriene (LT) B4, and 5S-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, whereas LTC4, D4, and E4 were undetectable. Similarly, alveolar macrophages stimulated with A23187 produced HHT, 5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, and LTB4 but no peptido-leukotrienes. When LTA4 was added to suspensions of eosinophils and macrophages, only LTB4 was formed, whereas in parallel experiments, intact human platelets incubated with LTA4 produced LTC4. These data suggest that guinea pig alveolar eosinophils and macrophages contain both cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase, but do not produce peptido-leukotrienes, probably lacking LTA4 glutathione transferase activity. These studies demonstrate that guinea pig eosinophils differ from eosinophils of other animal species which have been shown to be major sources of leukotriene C4. The present data imply that eosinophils and macrophages are not the source of peptido-leukotrienes in anaphylactic guinea pig lungs.\r"

Treatment of neonatal rats with the alternate degranulating agent compound 48/80 was found to induce a limited CTMC but not a MMC hyperplasia. A supernatant obtained by degranulating purified adult rat peritoneal mast cells with anti-IgE was found to induce hyperplasia of the CTMC population similar to that observed with NGF administration. However, this degranulation product supernatant only induced a limited MMC hyperplasia as judged by RMCP II content of the tissues. These results suggest that NGF has dual action inducing mast cell hyperplasia; CTMC hyperplasia being dependent on the ability of NGF to degranulate mast cells. MMC hyperplasia induced by NGF is independent of CTMC degranulation. Degranulation products from peritoneal mast cells act to increase both MMC and CTMC populations in the neonate. These data suggest that the CTMC population may be regulated by an autocrine positive feedback mechanism in vivo.\r"

Reversed phase HPLC of incubation supernatants revealed major lipid-like eosinophil chemotactic activity eluting in a peak containing 5(S), 15(S)dihydroxy-6,13-trans-8,11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (5,15-DiHETE) as well as a 8,15-dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. For further characterization of the ECL, some authentic dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were tested for eosinophil chemotactic activity. Only 5,15-DiHETE as well as 8(S), 15(S)-dihydroxy-5,11-cis-9,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid were found to be chemotaxins for human eosinophils, however, with an ED50 near 0.3 microM and 1.5 microM, respectively. The presence of high titer eosinophil chemotactic activity in ECL preparations let us look for a contaminating ECL with higher specific activity. By using a different reversed phase HPLC-system 5,15-DiHETE as well as 8(R), 15(S)-dihydroxy-5,11-cis-9,13-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid could be separated from a highly potent ECL. Final purification of this ECL by the use of straight phase HPLC resulted in a single at 260 nm absorbing peak giving an UV spectrum different from that known for eosinophil chemotactic factors indicating a novel type of eosinophil chemotactic lipid. Eosinophil chemotactic activity of purified ECL has been found to be similar to that seen for platelet-activating factor, the most potent chemotaxin so far known, either in the number of migrating cells or the ED50. Cross-desensitization experiments with ECL, leukotriene B4, and platelet-activating factor revealed the existence of a separate ECL receptor on eosinophils. The production of potent ECL by the responder cells themselves supports the idea that there exists a self-sustaining mechanism of eosinophil accumulation.\r"

These findings have been confirmed and extended by showing that the first CD8+ cell-dependent part of the response was enhanced by either the presence of CD4+ cells or systemic treatment with IL-2 and that it developed in the absence of detectable numbers of mononuclear phagocytes, whereas the later CD4+ cell part required monocytes or related elements. Furthermore, in the DTH reaction that was elicited with noninfectious viral Ag in mice previously immunized by infection, only the CD4+ cells participated. Thus, the two phases of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis-viral DTH reaction are principally different, which has to be taken into account when trying to assess the relevance of DTH during this virus infection.\r"

Administration of TNF-alpha (5 x 10(4) U/mouse) into mice at 6 or 12 h before the challenge with S. typhimurium organisms enhanced the bactericidal capacity in the peritoneal cavities of the mice. The diminution of the infecting organism in the peritoneal cavities of the TNF-alpha-treated mice was not due to the systemic spread of the organism inasmuch as few organism were recovered from other areas such as the spleen and liver. The TNF-alpha treatment effected a slight increase of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity, but did not effect an increase of macrophages, including Ia-bearing macrophages. The survival rate of mice infected with Salmonella was improved by the i.p. injection of TNF-alpha before infection. Co-administration of smaller doses of TNF-alpha (5 x 10(3) U) and murine rIFN-gamma (10(2) U) at 6 h before the challenge also effectively enhanced bactericidal activity and protectivity. The cooperative effect of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was only seen when these recombinant cytokines were injected together at the proper time before the challenge. Injection of rabbit anti-TNF-alpha serum abolished the effects of TNF-alpha and the cooperative effect of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. Furthermore, the serum could abolish the cooperative effect of IFN-gamma and LPS on bactericidal activity, suggesting participation of LPS-induced TNF-alpha in the cooperation.\r"

  ".W": "The E beta f and E beta q genes have been isolated and sequenced to investigate the molecular basis for their defective expression. A previous study from this laboratory, which characterized the expression of these genes at the RNA level, showed both genes to have defects in posttranscriptional RNA processing. In this paper, the defect in the E beta q gene from the inbred mouse strain B10.G (Mus musculus domesticus) is shown to be a single base insertion in the RNA donor splice site of the first intron. This identical mutation was described previously for the E beta gene of the H-2w17 haplotype, which was derived from the Asian house mouse subspecies Mus musculus castaneus. Although it has been estimated that M. m. domesticus and M. m. castaneus separated from each other more than one million years ago, comparisons of genomic sequences reveal that the nonexpressed E beta q and E beta w17 alleles have not diverged significantly from one another; they are identical in their protein coding regions and have only minor differences elsewhere. In contrast, sequence comparisons of A beta q and A beta w17 show that these two expressed alleles differ by multiple amino acids. These findings provide evidence that selection, acting on expressed MHC proteins, plays a role in accumulation and maintenance of MHC polymorphism. The defective E beta f gene from the inbred strain B10.M has also been isolated. Sequence analysis has identified a mutation in the same RNA donor splice site as E beta q and E beta w17; however, in this gene the mutation is a single base substitution at position 5.\r"

To examine the repertoire of expressed VH genes, we prepared a cDNA library from splenic mRNA of an alpha 1/alpha 1 rabbit and isolated 10 complete VH-encoding cDNA clones. None of the cDNA clones hybridized to an oligomer that had hybridized to more than 50% of cloned germ-line VH genes. These data indicate that only a subset of germ-line VH genes are used in functional VDJ rearrangements. DNA sequence analysis demonstrated that the 10 cDNA clones contained highly similar VH regions, further suggesting that the repertoire of utilized VH genes is limited. In contrast, the D regions of each of the 10 clones exhibited little similarity to one another, suggesting that the rabbit has a large D region repertoire. We propose that the apparent lack of diversity within the VH segment of VDJ rearrangements is offset by extensive D region diversity.\r"

  ".W": "The developmental time course of RNA transcribed from unrearranged (germ-line) and rearranged Ig genes in murine fetal liver was determined by a quantitative Northern blot analysis. Sterile Cmu transcripts and germ-line VH transcripts are detectable as early as day 14, whereas significant amounts of rearranged VDJCmu H chain transcripts do not appear until days 16 to 17. The sterile Cmu transcripts continuously increase in abundance throughout fetal development, in contrast to the germ-line VH transcripts, which decrease abruptly after day 16. Transcripts of germ-line and rearranged CK genes are detectable on day 17, and continue to increase in abundance on day 18. Transcripts from a pre-B cell specific gene, lambda 5, first appear on day 15, and reach maximum abundance on day 17. The order of these events is consistent with the known order of gene rearrangements and with the idea that transcriptional activation of germ-line loci is a prerequisite for Ig gene rearrangement. The lag between the onsets of germ-line Cmu and VH transcription and the appearance of VDJCmu transcripts suggests that additional developmentally regulated events may be necessary to achieve efficient expression of completely rearranged H chain genes.\r"

In our model system, treatment of the cytochrome c-specific T cell hybridoma 2B4.11 in vitro with Ag in the context of histocompatible APC results in cellular activation, as shown by IL-2 release and growth inhibition. In vivo treatment with Ag results in tumor cell elimination as a result both of a direct inhibitory effect of cytochrome c that is mediated through the 2B4.11 TCR and to the induction of host immunity. In vivo lymphocyte-depletion studies showed that CD8-bearing cells were critical to the successful elimination of tumor cells mediated by Ag, whereas depletion of CD4-bearing cells had only minor effects on the outcome. Cytotoxic cells from mice cured by Ag treatment lysed only 2B4.11 among a panel of related tumors, although in vivo cross-protection studies showed that 2B4.11-immune mice were also resistant to the growth of BW5147 and C10.9. Because spleen cells from 2B4.11 immune mice did not recognize 2B4.11 or other related tumors in proliferation assays, we concluded that a participant(s) with memory and specificity, not assayed in vitro, was also involved in the mediation of the immune effects observed. For therapies based on the use of less selective agents, i.e. mAb that share the activating properties of Ag but can react with T cell neoplasms of unknown specificity, it would appear that a relatively intact immune system is required for maximal success.\r"

Adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 effector cells specific for the minor histocompatibility Ag H-40a protects irradiated C.B-20 but not BALB/c recipients. Because C.B-20 donor cells could potentially generate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in BALB/c recipients, we investigated the possibility that GVHD prevents the anti-tumor effect. GVHD was induced in (C.B-20 X B10.D2)F1 [H-2d, H-40b X H-2d,H-40b] recipients after injection of B10.D2-primed C.B-20 donor cells. GVHD was indicated by the histologic appearance of tissue sections from C.B-20----F1 livers, target organs of GVHD, which showed a marked mononuclear cell infiltrate around the portal tracts and central veins. In addition, splenic lymphocytes from these mice had altered CD4/CD8 ratios and were unable to respond to the polyclonal activators Con A and LPS. The mitogen unresponsiveness was at least partially due to the presence of a suppressor cell, because proliferation of normal spleen cells to Con A and LPS was suppressed upon addition of C.B-20----F1 spleen cells. Further immune dysfunction was evident by the inability of T cells from mice with GVHD to generate a CTL response to H-2 alloantigens. Addition of C.B-20----F1 spleen cells to F1 responder cells at the induction of culture did not prevent generation of CTL, indicating that a suppressor cell was not responsible for the lack of CTL activity. In this setting of GVHD, F1 recipients were able to reject BCL1 upon adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 effector cells. These data indicate that GVHD-induced immune dysfunction does not inhibit the activity of antileukemia T cells.\r"

The three fractions were examined for their capacity to metabolize exogenous 14C-arachidonic acid (AA) into prostaglandins (PG) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETE). Cells found in the upper two fractions, which are less dense, have less proliferative potential in vitro, and are more differentiated than cells in the lower more dense fraction, are much more active in producing PG from exogenous AA than are the more dense cells. This was observed in intact cells as well as cells disrupted by freeze-thawing following density separation. The same relationship was found for HETE production in that cytoplasmic preparations from the two fractions containing the less dense cells were much more active in the production of HETE than cytoplasmic preparations from the more dense fraction. The two upper fractions differed little from each other in the production of PG or HETE. These results indicate the presence of higher levels of active cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenases in fractions containing the less dense, more differentiated cells than in the fraction containing the more dense, less differentiated cells which are highly enriched for basal keratinocytes.\r"

As part of studies to ascertain the physiologic stimuli for collagenase production by keratinocytes, we wanted to determine whether extracellular matrix could modulate the production of collagenase in vitro. Immunoprecipitable collagenase from the conditioned medium of cells grown on different types of matrix was measured. Metabolically labeled human keratinocytes were cultured in 0.1 mM calcium in serum-free medium on colloidal gold-coated coverslips plus type IV collagen, type I collagen, or laminin or in the absence of matrix. Immunoprecipitation of the conditioned medium with anti-collagenase antiserum was performed and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fluorography, and densitometry. The keratinocytes cultured on type IV or type I collagen produced more collagenase than did those cultured on laminin or in the absence of matrix. This effect did not reflect a general increase in secreted proteins, because the production of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase, or TIMP, did not increase under the same conditions. Phagocytosis of the gold salts by the keratinocytes migrating on types I or IV collagen did not account for the increased collagenase produced by these cells since the effect persisted in the absence of the colloidal gold and phagocytosis of latex beads did not augment collagenase production.\r"

  ".W": "Reversal of essential fatty acid deficiency (EFA) induced epidermal hyperproliferation was recently suggested to require linoleic acid and an active lipoxygenase product. Because the nature of this lipoxygenase product is unknown, we employed a model of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) induced hyperproliferation in guinea pig skin to test a possible reversal of the hyperproliferation by an oxidative metabolite of linoleic acid. Topical applications of two n-3 PUFA: 0.5% of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and/or of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3) for 5 d induced severe epidermal hyperproliferation. Development of the epidermal hyperproliferation paralleled a marked decrease in the major epidermal linoleic acid lipoxygenase product (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; 13-HODE). The application of 0.1% of 13-HODE to the n-3 PUFA-induced guinea pig hyperproliferative skin resulted in the restoration of normal epidermal histology and reversal of hyperproliferation as determined by epidermal uptake of 3H-thymidine. These data support the view that 13-HODE may represent the endogenous cutaneous mediator necessary for full restoration of cutaneous symptoms of essential fatty acid deficiency. Furthermore, the topical use of n-3 PUFA for the disruption of normal metabolism of skin n-6 EFA (linoleic acid) does serve as a useful tool for further investigations into the regulatory mechanisms of in vivo epidermal proliferation/differentiation.\r"

In mice injected in the cerebellum, vacuolization was limited to the cerebellum, medulla and mesencephalon, whereas injection into forebrain regions resulted in vacuolization in all brain regions. The studies suggested that the cerebellum had a selective vulnerability for 22L. In this study we examined the interaction between host genotype and selective vulnerability of specific brain regions. The mouse gene that has the most profound effect on pathogenesis, particularly incubation period, is termed Sinc (scrapie incubation). Groups of mice with three genotypes of Sinc (s7s7, p7p7 and their F1 cross, s7p7) were injected with 22L into the cerebral cortex, thalamus or cerebellum. Analysis of incubation periods showed that, regardless of the host genotype, the cerebellum injection group had a significantly shorter incubation period than groups injected in other regions. After cerebellum injection vacuolization was limited to the cerebellum, medulla and mesencephalon in all three host genotypes. The location of vacuoles within the cerebellum differed depending upon the host strain. Vacuolization developed almost exclusively in grey matter in s7s7 mice, mainly in white matter in p7p7 mice, and in both grey and white matter in F1 mice. These results demonstrate that the selective vulnerability of the cerebellum to induction of clinical disease by 22L does not depend on host genotype, but host genotype does affect lesion distribution within the cerebellum.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanisms involved in the spread of scrapie within the brain remain unclear. To examine this issue the 22L scrapie strain was injected in one side of the cerebellum of mice in which the cerebellum had been bisected prior to injection. Another group of animals received the same injection into intact cerebella, i.e. without prior bisection. We found that bisection of the cerebella delayed the spread of scrapie agent from the injection site to the contralateral side of the cerebellum and that the occurrence of vacuolization was not as extensive and was markedly delayed in the uninjected side compared to its occurrence after injection in the intact cerebellum. Replication of agent in an area preceded the development of vacuolization in that area by several weeks. There was marked loss of Purkinje cells on the injected side of bisected cerebella, with no loss seen on the uninjected side. The incubation period of scrapie disease in mice injected after cerebellar bisection was significantly longer than after the injection of intact cerebella. The results in this study suggest that the scrapie agent spreads along intact nerve cell tracts, probably by axonal transport.\r"

  ".W": "We report the effects on the fibrinolytic system of intravenous (IV) recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rTNF-alpha) infusions in patients with advanced cancers. During a phase I clinical trial of rTNF-alpha, the plasma fibrinolytic system was closely monitored, measuring tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, plasminogen activator (PA) inhibitor activity, and plasma fibrinolytic activity. Thirteen patients with refractory malignancies received 40, 80, or 160 micrograms/m2 rTNF-alpha as 2-hour IV infusions. After a 1-week rest, the same dose was repeated daily for 5 days every 3 weeks for a maximum of four courses. The serum rTNF-alpha levels peaked at the completion of the IV infusion and rapidly declined thereafter, becoming unmeasurable within 1 hour in all patients. rTNF-alpha infusion markedly alters the plasma fibrinolytic system. During the 2-hour infusion, significant increases in the tPA antigen and plasma fibrinolytic activity were seen. After the infusion, PA inhibitor activity increased, neutralizing the plasma fibrinolytic activity. The increase in PA inhibitor activity was maximal 6 hours after the onset of the rTNF-alpha infusion. Fibrinolytic properties returned to pretreatment values within 24 hours. Daily rTNF-alpha infusions caused changes in plasma tPA antigen and PA inhibitor similar to those of single infusions. We conclude from these observations that the administration of rTNF-alpha in vivo to cancer patients causes profound alterations of endothelial cell-derived components of the fibrinolytic system.\r"

  ".W": "Technetium-99m-HM-PAO [( 99mTc]HM-PAO) leukocyte and indium-111-oxine (111In-oxine) leukocyte scanning were carried out simultaneously in 41 patients at 4 hr and 24 hr after reinjection to determine whether the 4-hr 99mTc scan could replace the 24-hr 111In scan for detecting intraabdominal sepsis. Abdominal infection was confirmed in 12 cases. The 4-hr 99Tc-leukocyte scan, the 4-hr 111In-leukocyte scan, and the 24-hr 111In-leukocyte scan yielded a sensitivity of 100%, 67%, and 100%, respectively, and a specificity of 62%, 90%, and 86%, respectively. The 24-hr 99mTc-leukocyte scan also produced a sensitivity of 100%, but it was falsely positive in all 29 cases without infection due to physiologic bowel uptake. False-positive 4-hr 99mTc-leukocyte scans were also produced by physiologic bowel uptake in seven cases all of whom had true-negative 4-hr and 24-hr 111In-leukocyte scans. Because of the high incidence of false-positive 4-hr [99mTc]HM-PAO leukocyte scans, it was concluded that they could not replace 24-hr 111In-leukocyte scans for detecting intraabdominal sepsis, and that serial 99mTc leukocyte scans starting earlier than 4 hr after reinjection must be evaluated.\r"

We retrospectively reviewed the utility of indium-111-(111In) labeled autologous leukocyte scintigraphy in 26 patients (30 scans) with synthetic vascular grafts, on chronic hemodialysis, in whom hemodialysis access site infection was a diagnostic consideration. Leukocyte scintigraphy correctly identified all fifteen access-site infections; there was one false-positive study, for an overall sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 93%, respectively. Of particular significance is the fact that in nine (60%) of the fifteen access-site infections, physical examination was normal. Our data indicate that 111In-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy is a useful procedure for the diagnosis of hemodialysis access-site infection, and it is especially valuable when physical examination of the access site is normal.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of iron status on calcium disodium edetate (CaNa2EDTA)-induced lead diuresis was examined in 112 children with moderate lead intoxication. Patients whose blood lead levels were between 25 and 55 micrograms/dl and who had erythrocyte protoporphyrin concentrations greater than or equal to 35 micrograms/dl underwent provocative testing to determine the need for a full course of chelation therapy. A blood sample for lead, erythrocyte protoporphyrin, and serum ferritin determinations was obtained immediately before the intramuscular administration of CaNa2EDTA, 500 mg/m2. Determination of urinary lead level was based on an 8-hour urine collection. Blood lead and ferritin levels were significantly correlated with urinary lead excretion: r = 0.542 and 0.298, respectively, p less than 0.01 for both. Multiple regression models were tested to assess the independent effects of the variables. With blood lead level controlled, ferritin remained significantly associated with urinary lead excretion; for every 1 ng/ml increase in ferritin, urinary lead increased by 2.4 micrograms. This small effect of ferritin on urinary lead was illustrated in a discriminant analysis. Using blood lead level by itself as the independent variable resulted in a 76% correct assignment of provocative test outcomes. Knowing the ferritin level improved this assignment accuracy by only 3%. We conclude that the iron status, as measured by serum ferritin, of children with moderate lead intoxication, has a small but significant effect on CaNa2EDTA-induced lead diuresis. This effect may influence the interpretation of borderline provocative test outcomes. Although chelation therapy should not be withheld pending treatment of iron deficiency, lead stores should be reassessed after iron repletion.\r"

  ".U": "90172090\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of different treatment regimens and the influence of parental height on the statural growth of 40 patients with hereditary vitamin D-resistant hypophosphatemic rickets were investigated. Three treatment regimens, each with oral phosphate, were used: vitamin D (0.5 to 2 mg/day), calcidiol (50 to 200 micrograms/day), and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 to 3 micrograms/day). Mean duration of follow-up was 9.5 +/- 5.1 years. The results show that (1) there was no acceleration of growth before puberty for the majority of children treated with vitamin D (12/16) or calcidiol (13/15), whereas 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 promoted catch-up growth in 10 of 16 patients; (2) height gain during puberty was normal, irrespective of the treatment; (3) most vitamin D-treated male and female subjects and calcidiol-treated male subjects had short adult stature, but the majority (75%) of the 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3-treated groups had normal stature; (4) parental stature had little influence on the adult height of male subjects, but that of affected girls was positively correlated (p less than 0.002) with mid-parental height. These results demonstrate that 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 is superior to vitamin D or calcidiol for improvement of stature of patients with hypophosphatemic vitamin D-resistant rickets, and indicate the importance of parental height in determining the adult height of affected girls.\r"

Because the rate of thromboembolic events is quite low and the period of increased risk is very short, the cost of preventing these rare events can be great. We performed cost-effectiveness analyses addressing these issues. We calculated the marginal cost per additional quality-adjusted year of life gained per thromboembolic event averted and per death averted. We conclude that the marginal cost of prolonging hospitalization to administer heparin is prohibitively high compared with most contemporary therapies, except when the patient has the most thrombogenic of valves. We also discuss the ethical and legal ramifications of integrating the results of cost-effectiveness analyses into clinical practice.\r"

The study concludes that the recent growth (approximately 15% in real terms between 1983 and 1985) has been more rapid in areas with higher incomes per capita and suggests that this may be related to faster adoption and diffusion of new medical technologies in these areas. The volume of physician services had grown considerably faster for those specialists who utilize newer procedures and technologies than for those who do not. The study also provides evidence that the sharp increase in assignment rates in recent years because of the introduction of the physician participation program also contributed to the growth in physician services during this period. Medicare's prospective payment system, which controlled hospital payments and encouraged hospitals to become more efficient, had at most a small positive impact on the growth in Part B spending. Finally, the freeze on physician's fees did not seem to have had a major impact on the volume of physician services.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical use of a single cannula would make extracorporeal membrane oxygenation simpler and less aggressive. It would probably limit the occurrence of the complications of currently used techniques (double-cannula, venoarterial, or venovenous bypass). In this experimental study an original system is described that is composed of a single cannula, an alternating clamp, and a nonocclusive roller pump, the characteristics of which permit its use as a venous reservoir. To overcome the limitations of the oxygenation in any venovenous bypass, we used the method of \"apneic oxygenation\" through the natural lungs, which we previously proved efficient in infants and children. The optimal setting of the alternative clamp was first tested in vitro to obtain the maximal flow in the circuit and the minimal amount of recirculation. The single-cannula bypass then was compared with a two-cannula circuit regarding the efficiency of carbon dioxide removal and the hemodynamic consequences. At less than 50% of the maximal speed of the pump, flows were equivalent in both types of circuits. The efficiency of carbon dioxide removal was only slightly decreased by the use of a single cannula (30 +/- 2 ml/min versus 36 +/- 2 ml/min with two cannulas). This could easily be offset by increasing the gas flow/blood flow ratio in the oxygenator. Arterial carbon dioxide tension was maintained at normal levels in both types of circuits. Hemodynamic condition was only slightly affected by the alternative flow of the bypass. This system of single-cannula membrane lung support thus seems to be adequate for clinical use.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was made of 59 open lung biopsy specimens taken between 1984 and 1988 from children with congenital heart disease who were at risk for pulmonary vascular disease. Thirty-seven patients (ranging in age from 3.5 months to 23 years; median age, 14 months) had a primary left-to-right shunt (group A) and 22 patients (ages 1 to 15 years) had palliated cyanotic heart disease (group B). Forty-five of the lung biopsy specimens were requested as frozen sections. In both groups lung biopsy specimens were graded by the Heath-Edwards classification and correlated against preoperative hemodynamic data and outcome. In group A patients, carefully measured pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratio were reliable indicators of the structural state of the pulmonary vascular bed, obviating the need for routine lung biopsy. Pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance ratios greater than 0.45 accurately predicted all patients with irreversible pulmonary vascular disease, and pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 7 units.m2 accurately predicted all but one case of disease. Reversibility of pulmonary vascular changes is not synonymous with immediate postoperative survival: Fatal postoperative pulmonary hypertensive crises occurred in the presence of reversible pulmonary disease. Of those considered for the Fontan procedure, a mean pulmonary artery pressure less than 30 mm Hg and pulmonary vascular resistance less than 3 units.m2 correlated with Heath-Edwards grade I or normal lung biopsy results. In 36% of group B patients, reliable assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance could not be made, indicating a possible need for open lung biopsy procedures. When lung biopsy procedures were used as an isolated procedure, they were more dangerous (20% mortality, 13% morbidity) than previously reported. Intraoperative frozen sections are not adequate to accurately assess pulmonary vascular changes (9% error); serial paraffin sections are required.\r"

We now report on a gene on human chromosome 11, at the junction of the T-cell tumour-associated chromosomal translocation t(11; 14) (p15; q11) and known as the 11p15 gene or Ttg, which is believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of the tumour. It has two transcriptional promoters (both retained by the translocated allele) and is expressed in tumour cells with neuro-endocrine properties, suggesting that normal expression may occur in nerve cells. Using fusion constructs of one 11p15 promoter and lacZ in transgenic mice, we found that the gene is expressed in a segment-specific manner in rhombomeres of the developing mouse hind-brain. During subsequent development, the gene is more widely expressed, again in precisely defined regional patterns, but in post-mitotic neurons confined to the central nervous system. Thus, this presumptive T-cell oncogene is both developmentally regulated and segmentally restricted in a tissue different from that in which the original tumour arose.\r"

Altered vasomotor regulation in atherosclerosis could partly reflect an injurious action of abnormal lipoproteins on endothelium. Recently, 'cell-modified' or 'oxidized' low-density lipoprotein (EC-LDL) has received increasing attention because of its potential cytotoxic and atherogenic properties. We report here that arteries exposed to EC-LDL in vitro show an endothelium-dependent vasoregulatory impairment closely resembling that of atherosclerotic arteries. Our results indicate that transfer of lysolecithin from EC-LDL to endothelial membranes produces a selective unresponsiveness to receptor-regulated endothelium-dependent vasodilators.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes is generally thought to be regulated by the combination of the VH promoter with the enhancer element which is located in the JH-CH intron. This is probably an oversimplification: there are cell lines that transcribe IgH genes despite the deletion of the intron-enhancer. These findings could imply that other enhancer element(s) exist in the IgH locus. Here we show that a strong B-cell-specific enhancer is indeed located at the 3'-end of the rat IgH locus, 25 kilobases downstream of C alpha. This enhancer should be retained downstream of all rearranged IgH genes, regardless of the VH or CH segment used. Taken together with analogous findings for the mouse kappa locus, the results prompt a re-evaluation of the mechanism of regulation of immunoglobulin gene transcription. Furthermore, unlike the intron-enhancer, the IgH 3' enhancer would become linked to a c-myc that rearranges into an IgH switch region. The IgH 3' enhancer could therefore play a part in the activation of the translocated c-myc genes in rat immunocytomas, mouse plasmacytomas and Burkitt lymphomas.\r"

Seven days later angiography was repeated and the animals were killed. One animal in the 72-hour group developed a delayed ischemic deficit on Day 7 after subarachnoid hemorrhage. In the control and 72-hour groups significant vasospasm occurred in most of the major, right cerebral arteries (P less than 0.05), but no significant vasospasm developed in the 0-, 24-, and 48-hour groups. Although a large subarachnoid clot remained in the control animals, most clot had been dissolved in all treatment groups. Lysing of subarachnoid hematoma with intrathecal tissue plasminogen activator within 72 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage is effective in preventing vasospasm in primates.\r"

Embryonic day-4 and -5 (E4 and E5) optic stalks were explanted in vitro. Within the first few days of culture, numerous morphologically identifiable neurons extending long neurites developed. These neurons and their processes were specifically labeled with neurofilament antibodies. Similar results were obtained by explanting only the medial portion of E7 optic stalks away from possibly contaminating cerebral or retinal tissue. To determine whether neuronal potentialities persisted at later embryonic stages, cultures of dissociated optic stalks were established at E11, E15, and E18. Neurons labeled with the various neurofilament antibodies appeared in all cultures of E11 and E15 optic stalks. However, typical neurons could not be recognized in cultures of E18 optic nerves. These results indicate that cells with neuronal potentialities are present in the embryonic optic nerve from early stages of development and persist until at least E15. Since the adult optic nerve is devoid of nerve cell bodies, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that axons of retinal ganglion cells, which course through the optic stalk, repress neuronal potentialities within a subpopulation of precursor cells during normal development.\r"

To generate amounts of nucleic acids sufficient for use in standard cloning strategies, we have devised a method for producing amplified heterogeneous populations of RNA from limited quantities of cDNA. Whole cerebellar RNA was primed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence 5' to a polythymidylate region. After second-strand cDNA synthesis, T7 RNA polymerase was used to generate amplified antisense RNA (aRNA). Up to 80-fold molar amplification has been achieved from nanogram quantities of cDNA. The amplified material is similar in size distribution to the parent cDNA and shows sequence heterogeneity as assessed by Southern and Northern blot analysis. Specific messages for moderate-abundance mRNAs for actin and guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G-protein) alpha subunits have been detected in the amplified material. By using in situ transcription to generate cDNA, sequences for cyclophilin have been detected in aRNA derived from single cerebellar tissue sections. cDNA derived from a single cerebellar Purkinje cell also has been amplified and yields material that hybridizes to cognate whole RNA and mRNA but not to Escherichia coli RNA.\r"

We describe here a solution to this problem as applied to a model system, the singed (sn) locus. Our method is a combination of classical genetics and molecular biology: sib selection plus the polymerase chain reaction. We have used the method to isolate rare individuals with P-element-induced alleles of sn merely by recognition of the DNA structures induced at the locus by transposon insertion. Phenotypic criteria were used only retrospectively to verify our diagnoses. There are obvious implications of this technique for the mutagenesis of other organisms.\r"

This selective reagent binds stoichiometrically to the enzyme; more than 90% of the label was bound to its light subunit. Enzymatic digestion of the light subunit gave a 14C-labeled peptide that corresponds to amino acid residues 517-527 of the enzyme and two incomplete digestion products that contain this labeled peptide moiety. The radioactivity associated with this peptide was released with threonine-523 during sequencing by the automated gas-phase Edman method. The light subunit contains 14 other threonine residues and a total of 19 serine residues; these were not labeled.

The genes encoding these two enzymes, draT and draG, have been cloned from these two organisms, so that direct genetic evidence can be marshaled to test this model in vivo. The draT/G system has been transferred to and monitored in the enteric nitrogen-fixing bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae, an organism normally devoid of such a regulatory mechanism. The expressed draT and draG genes allowed K. pneumoniae to respond to NH4Cl with a reversible regulation of nitrogenase activity that was correlated with the reversible ADP-ribosylation of dinitrogenase reductase in vivo. Thus, the expression of draT and draG genes in K. pneumoniae is necessary and sufficient to support NH4(+)-switch-off/on, and ADP-ribosylation serves as a reversible regulatory mechanism for controlling nitrogenase activity in prokaryotes.\r"

Two other proteins, 68 and 70 kDa, were localized in mitochondria (P68mit) and chloroplasts (P70chl), respectively, and they crossreacted with a polyclonal antibody raised against the Escherichia coli heat-shock protein DnaK.

A greater enrichment of gamma delta + T cells is observed, upon preexposure to mycobacterial antigens in vivo. By comparing the effects of heat shock with that of mitogen or specific T-cell triggering by conventional antigens and by analyzing the gamma delta T-cell receptor genes expressed in cells that proliferate as a result of heat shock induction, we conclude that a subset of murine gamma delta T cells react to antigens on self cells in which a heat shock response was induced.\r"

Purified SpoOA protein binds to a specific region of the abrB promoter and functions as a repressor of transcription in an in vitro assay. The binding of the SpoOA protein is independent of the binding of the AbrB protein, which is known to autoregulate its expression.

This procedure selectively links the t-PA to the column because the acetylated heparin has no free amino groups. The procedure also protects the heparin-binding site(s) on the enzyme during coupling to the matrix. The t-PA column separates heparin into two fractions, one with low affinity for t-PA and one with high affinity. Both fractions of heparin effectively accelerate inactivation of thrombin by antithrombin III. However, the fractions differ in their ability to stimulate t-PA: the low-affinity heparin has no effect on the activity of t-PA, whereas the high-affinity heparin enhances this activity. These heparin fractions will be useful in characterizing the biochemical basis and physiological consequences of the heparin--t-PA interaction.\r"

The method has been applied successfully to the determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of human, bovine, and rat parathymosins. Prothymosin alpha and other blocked proteins and peptides were also readily deblocked and sequenced by this procedure. It is proposed that the mechanism of the deblocking reaction involves an acid-catalyzed N----O shift of the acetyl group followed by a beta-elimination.\r"

  ".U": "90175421\r", 
  ".W": "Exposing primary cultures of cerebellar granule neurons to 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 24 hr decreases the Ca2+/phosphatidylserine/diolein-dependent protein kinase C (PKC; ATP:protein phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.37) by approximately 90% in the 100,000 x g supernatant and pellet fractions of neuronal culture homogenates. Immunoblot analysis of the homogenates with polyclonal antibodies raised against either the beta-type PKC peptide or total rat brain PKC reveals a virtual loss of 78-kDa PKC immunoreactivity in the supernatant and a marked decrease of PKC immunoreactivity in the pellet. Exposure of the cultures to 50 microM glutamate for 15 min (no Mg2+) induces the translocation of supernatant PKC immunoreactivity to the pellet. Such translocation persists after glutamate withdrawal and is followed by a progressive increase in neuronal death, which begins 2 hr later. Neuronal death approaches completion in about 24 hr. PMA-induced down-regulation of PKC decreases glutamate-elicited neurotoxicity. Yet, the culture exposure to 100 nM PMA fails to decrease the high-affinity binding of [3H]glutamate to neuronal membranes and does not reduce glutamate-induced activation of ionotropic or metabolotropic receptors (assayed as total membrane current measured in whole-cell voltage-clamped neurons, 45Ca2+ uptake in intact monolayers, inositolphospholipid hydrolysis, and transcriptional activation and translation of c-fos mRNA). Moreover, the immediate cell-body swelling and activation of spectrin proteolysis elicited by glutamate remain unchanged. On the other hand, PMA-induced PKC down-regulation reduces any increase in 45Ca2+ uptake or Ca2(+)-dependent proteolysis (measured as spectrin degradation) after glutamate withdrawal. These results support the view that PKC translocation is operative in glutamate-induced destabilization of cytosolic ionized Ca2+ homeostasis and neuronal death.\r"

Membrane-bound rab3 in brain is exclusively localized on synaptic vesicles, the secretory organelles of the synapse that store and release neurotransmitters. rab3 is also expressed in endocrine tissues such as the adrenal medulla, where it is found together with other synaptic vesicle proteins on microvesicles distinct from chromaffin granules. The tight binding of rab3 to membranes correlates with hydrophobic modifications that are different in the membrane-bound and soluble forms of rab3. The results demonstrate the exclusive targeting of a small GTP-binding protein to secretory vesicles of a subset of the regulated pathway of secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Data on the number of AIDS cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) from January 1984 to June 1989 are used to predict the number of AIDS cases that will be diagnosed during the years 1989 through 1993. Using quadratic and linear models with the most recent data, it is projected that about 44,000 cases will be diagnosed in 1989, 56,000 in 1990, 70,000 in 1991, 87,000 in 1992, and 104,000 in 1993. These projections are lower than estimates derived using data from January 1984 to June 1988, and they are similar to estimates derived by the CDC. The lifetime medical care cost of treating a person with AIDS is estimated to be about $75,000 (all estimates are in 1988 dollars) assuming that the average length of survival is 15 months and that the intensity of care (that is, the cost of medical care per month) does not fall as longevity rises. This total, $75,000, reflects recent increases in the length of survival and the diffusion of costly drug therapies (for example, AZT and aerosol pentamidine). This study forecasts that the cumulative lifetime medical care costs of treating all people diagnosed with AIDS during a given year to be about $3.3 billion in 1989, $4.3 billion in 1990, $5.3 billion in 1991, $6.5 billion in 1992, and $7.8 billion in 1993.\r"

In particular, an increased number of State maternal mortality review committees have become inactive or disbanded primarily because of concern over liability of committee members and committee proceedings being used in litigation. A study was conducted of legal protection of the expert review process at the State level. The relevant immunity and privilege statutes of each State and the protection afforded by State law were analyzed. Findings show that, in all but a few States, the legal risk of participating in expert review is negligible. Most States have statutes that protect information involved in the review process from disclosure or use in subsequent litigation. Laws in most States also protect participants in the review process (both members of committees and providers of information) from civil liability.\r"

It is a long-standing practice that has far reaching implications for prevention and treatment--implications for public health as well as clinical personnel who work in settings where they have the potential for influencing health knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of their patients. Pica practices also challenge researchers and social scientists whose work encompass development and refinement of models related to nutritional deficiencies. The body of literature on pica is so fragmented that it is difficult to find a precise summary of the knowns and unknowns about the condition. There is little consistency in defining pica, classifying substances ingested, identifying key characteristics of practicers, recommending treatment, or in projecting outcomes. This review presents a framework for understanding pica as a general practice, summarizes divergent reported hypotheses and conclusions, and illustrates that there is a need for more comprehensive studies of prevalence and incidence and use of deductive as well as inductive research processes.\r"

This measure, the life table-derived mortality rate (LTM), is the sum of the product of the probability of being alive at the beginning of an interval times the probability of dying of the cancer of interest during the interval times the annual age-adjusted incidence rate for each year that data have been collected. When the LTM is compared to death certificate mortality rates (DCM) for organ sites with no known misclassification problems, the LTM was within 10 percent of the death certificate rates for 13 of 14 organ sites. In the sites that have problems with the death certificate rates, there were major disagreements between the LTM and DCM. The LTM was systematically lower than the DCM for sites if there was overreporting on the death certificates, and the LTM was higher than the DCM for sites if there was underreporting. The limitations and applications of the LTM are detailed.\r"

As expected, these changes caused major discontinuities for IHD and HPB. These discontinuities were not, however, uniform over sex-race groups. When examined by component ICD codes, the discontinuities were found to vary in both magnitude and direction among the groups. In addition to discontinuity, there was a change in the rate of decline for IHD and HBP after the changeover. This rate of decline varied as well by sex-race group. In general, the decline among blacks was slower than among whites. Earlier studies that assessed IHD mortality have used different groupings of ICD codes to obviate the discontinuity, and researchers have observed a similar differential decline. These results should be viewed with caution because of the potential impact of differential coding on sex-race groups. As preparations are made for ICD-10, special attention should be given to the preservation of epidemiologic continuity to provide better assessment of trends in population subgroups.\r"

Audiologic evaluation showed that 36 percent of the firefighters had moderate or severe hearing loss (a threshold of 40 decibels (dB) or more at 3,000, 4,000, or 6,000 hertz (Hz) in either ear). An educational program on NIHL was then carried out to increase the use of hearing protection devices (HPDs) by firefighters, followed by an evaluation of the intervention. The educational intervention successfully increased knowledge of NIHL, positive attitudes toward HPDs, and resulted in more frequent use of HPDs. After the intervention, 85 percent of firefighters regularly used HPDs compared with 20 percent before the intervention. Recommendations are made for fire departments to reduce the risk of NIHL.\r"

Factors associated with vaccination included at least one prior visit to the health center, having health insurance, and extent of knowledge of the effects of hepatitis B. Among those not vaccinated, 68 percent would like to be but were deterred by the perceived high cost of the vaccine. The predominant reason given by the 31 percent who have decided not to be vaccinated was the perception that they were not at risk because of monogamous sexual relationships, or \"safer\" sexual practices. Strategies for maximizing vaccine use among homosexually active men should focus on increasing both awareness of the vaccine and appropriate perceptions of risk.\r"

Training was carried out under a continuing education model offered through six university-based schools of nursing. Questionnaires were sent to the 111 GNPs trained. Of the 102 respondents, 97 provided complete information about past and present education, work experience, and job functions. The GNPs were women with a median age of 45 years, and they were employed in rural settings in the western United States. More than 45 percent of the nurses had at least a baccalaureate degree at the time of GNP training. The GNPs remained employed in long-term care positions that implemented the practitioner role. The median length of GNP employment in their first jobs after training was more than 4.5 years. The resignation rate from this first position was 1.66 resignations for each 10 years of GNP employment. Job changes were likely to be attributed to organizational changes with subsequent positions shifting toward a diversification of the GNP role. The study demonstrates the success of the MSHC program in introducing and retaining GNPs in nursing homes.\r"

Several black churches in Chicago that were willing to host hypertension screenings for their congregations were identified; the picture books will be distributed through their Sunday School classes. Medical students, physicians, and members of the Black Nurses Association have been recruited to work collaboratively to introduce the picture book-manual, to instruct children on how to measure blood pressure, and to assist in the initial hypertension screenings at the churches. Funding is needed to print the manual and purchase sphygmomanometer sets for training. With the manual, equipment, and proper instruction of the children, each church will have the manpower to screen its at-risk population as often as possible. Educating black children about hypertension and its detection increases their awareness and provides them with the knowledge to screen adults. The success of this community support system is the exchange of knowledge between children and adults and the constant followup and preventive intervention supplied through a dominant community organization, the black church.\r"

Often they become perpetrators of abuse, continuing the cycle into future generations. Studies have indicated that mothers who are likely to abuse their children can be identified by a predictive method during the prenatal and postpartum periods. Pilot studies have indicated that mothers who are identified by the method and who receive early intervention, consisting of home visits by registered nurses, show a significantly lower rate of verified cases of child abuse. The author proposes a strategy for early intervention to prevent child abuse and neglect and to help infants and children attain their appropriate developmental milestones. The strategy calls for training and employing women from the Foster Grandparent Program. Foster grandmothers would be a valuable resource for high-risk mothers, providing role models for parenting skills in the home setting. Participating foster grandmothers would be trained and supervised in an interdisciplinary team setting. Evaluation of the program would compare the target population of infants and children whose mothers received the proposed intervention with a similar high-risk group that received only traditional interventions.\r"

Adriamycin (3 mg/kg) and mitomycin C (1 mg/kg) were given to mongrel dogs through the hepatic artery with three different durations of 1, 10, and 20 minutes. Plasma drug levels were determined at the inlet and outlet of DHP and right external jugular vein (systemic level). Blood flow through DHP averaged 200 ml/min. In dogs without DHP (group I; n = 4), systemic levels of adriamycin and mitomycin C increased rapidly with 1-minute infusion, reaching the peak values of 6.61 +/- 2.44 (mean +/- SD) and 2.20 +/- 1.05 micrograms/ml, respectively. With DHP under single venous bypass (group II; n = 5), the peak values were reduced to 1.25 +/- 1.02 and 0.79 +/- 0.52 microgram/ml. Moreover, the peak levels were markedly reduced by DHP under hepatic venous isolation (group III; n = 6), the values being 0.41 +/- 0.15 and 0.13 +/- 0.07 microgram/ml with 1-minute infusion. The drug-removal rates were improved substantially in group III compared with group II. The longer the duration of infusion, the higher the removal rates tended to be in group III. These results indicate that effective elimination of anticancer drugs can be accomplished by this system during intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver.\r"

  ".W": "We report on the excitatory effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid, which increased after the oral administration of valproate sodium, on anal canal resting pressure in human beings, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. We used this drug in order to improve continence after ileoanal anastomosis. Seventeen patients (eight with ulcerative colitis and nine with adenomatosis coli) were tested after receiving ileoanal anastomosis. The placebo showed no effect, but valproate sodium could ameliorate frequent defecation and soiling and the resulting perianal skin complications. Increasing anal resting pressure was also observed during valproate sodium administration without the amplitude, frequency of peristaltic wave, or voluntary squeeze pressure being affected. These results suggest that the subchronic administration of valproate sodium may be useful in the treatment of minor incontinence after ileoanal anastomosis.\r"

With antibiotic prophylaxis, the rates can be reduced to less than 5%. Three questions are still controversial: Do all patients undergoing biliary surgery require antibiotic prophylaxis? What is the ideal antibiotic for use in biliary surgery? What should be the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis? In this study we prospectively evaluated the efficacy of a single dose of antibiotic prophylaxis in biliary surgery, administered to patients at high risk for infection, in a trial comparing cefonicid (a cephalosporin with a long half-life) with mezlocillin (a broad-spectrum ureidopenicillin).\r"

  ".W": "We used neonatal piglets to determine the influence of plasma glucose concentration on cerebral energy metabolism during and immediately after partial ischemia. We assessed cerebral metabolism using in vivo phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Arterial plasma glucose concentration was increased in four piglets by systemic infusions of dextrose in water for comparison with infusions of saline in four controls or decreased in eight piglets by fasting for 24-48 hours for comparison with four fed piglets. Plasma glucose concentration showed a significant linear correlation with intracellular pH (r = -0.7, p less than 0.05). Piglets that developed hypoglycemia during partial ischemia had a smaller reduction in intracellular pH and a larger increase in inorganic phosphate content than piglets that were normoglycemic or hyperglycemic during ischemia. Similar differences persisted during the first 5 minutes of postischemic reperfusion. Subsequently, the cerebral concentrations of phosphorylated compounds returned to normal in all piglets. Our results demonstrate that 1) arterial plasma glucose concentration influences cerebral energy metabolism and intracellular pH during ischemia, 2) neonatal piglets can develop profound brain acidosis, and 3) brain acidosis during ischemia does not influence the restoration of cerebral phosphorylated compounds to control levels during the first 90 minutes after ischemia.\r"

The enteral nutrient formulas (ENFs) containing the solid or liquid dosage forms were stored at 24 degrees C and samples were taken at times 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 24 hours. At each sampling time, the mixtures were visually examined for signs of incompatibilities such as precipitation, viscosity changes, and phase separation. Samples from each time period were analyzed by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The drugs mixed with half-strength ENFs were also passed through ultrafiltration membranes to separate complexed from uncomplexed drug. Neither visual changes nor variations in pH were observed in any formula. With the exception of cephalexin suspension in half-strength ENFs, none of the drug concentrations changed appreciably throughout the study period. The assays performed for undecomposed drug at each sampling time for the various full- or half-strength ENF-solid drug mixtures stored at 24 degrees C for 24 hours ranged from 92.3 to 103.4 percent for cephalexin, 96.2 to 103.0 percent for cimetidine, 93.9 to 106.2 percent for diazepam, and 95.5 to 102.2 percent for propranolol. For the liquid drugs, the concentration ranged from 86.5 to 102.0 percent for cephalexin, 97.0 to 101.1 percent for cimetidine, 98.2 to 103.0 percent for diazepam, and 97.4 to 104.8 percent for propranolol. Ultrafiltration studies showed varying percent binding dependent on the drug studied.\r"

Concern is expressed that the guidelines issued by the National Cholesterol Education Program extend beyond the available evidence and do not adequately take into account problems with adherence to diet and drug regimens or the cost of widespread implementation. The cost-effectiveness of drug treatment for both high cholesterol and hypertension depends on the populations at which they are targeted.\r"

In addition to financial benefits, antihypertensive agents can also improve a patient's quality of life. This can be measured with a variety of health profiles or indexes and is often expressed together with life expectancy in quality-adjusted life years.

  ".W": "Numerous studies have demonstrated that antihypertensive agents differentially affect blood lipids. Thiazide diuretics increase total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides and cause a slight reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Most beta-blockers are associated with large increases in triglycerides and substantial reductions in HDL. Conversely, alpha 1-inhibitors, such as prazosin, doxazosin, and terazosin, lower total cholesterol, increases HDL, and favorably alter the HDL/total cholesterol ratio. Results of major clinical trials have demonstrated that lowering total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein and increasing HDL reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Therefore concerns have increased that the lipid effects of thiazides and some beta-blockers may totally or partly negate the beneficial reduction on coronary heart disease afforded by blood pressure reduction. Trial data can be used to estimate the potential secondary costs of disease outcomes that would be associated with lipid differences. Because there are presumably no secondary costs with alpha 1-inhibitors as a result of their favorable effects on lipids and because there are substantial secondary costs associated with thiazides, the cost of long-term treatment would be similar for the two agents.\r"

This article investigates the reasons for this decline and concludes that most of the decline in CHD has been the result of life-style changes, particularly reduction in serum cholesterol and cigarette smoking. The CHD Policy Model is used to compare the effect of a targeted versus a population-wide program of cholesterol reduction. On the basis of these projections, population-wide interventions are considered an important part of cholesterol reduction programs. The article also assesses the cost-effectiveness of selected cardiac interventions, for example, screening exercise tolerance tests, coronary care units, thrombolysis in acute myocardial infarction, and beta-blockers in patients after myocardial infarction. Cost-effectiveness analysis is seen to be crucial as medical costs escalate and the population at risk from CHD increases.\r"

This article presents an illustrative example of how the cost-benefit approach can be used in the pricing of a new pharmaceutical product. Doxazosin, a new selective alpha 1-inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, is compared with the established beta-blocker, atenolol. Cost-effectiveness ratios are calculated for both, and from the analysis it emerges that doxazosin is the more cost-effective agent. This is largely the result of the favorable high-density lipoprotein/total cholesterol changes that doxazosin produces. Even when doxazosin is priced 30% higher than atenolol, doxazosin is more cost-effective. It is concluded that in the future economic evaluations will have significant impacts on research and development within the pharmaceutical industry. However, a number of issues still must be addressed, and economic evaluation should be subject to continuous review.\r"

The Swedish and U.S. populations are compared, and the results are expressed in years of life saved. Cost-effectiveness of intervention is assessed by combining economic and clinical data, and the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratios are found in the elderly population with high levels of serum cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure. In contrast, the costs per year of life saved in the younger population at low risk are comparatively high.\r"
