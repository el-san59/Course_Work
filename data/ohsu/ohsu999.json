Neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)- containing nerve fibers were densely distributed along with adrenergic and cholinergic nerve fibers in the major pial arteries at the base of the brain, an area that forms the circle of Willis, and in the lenticulostriate arteries. In contrast, distribution was sparse in the cortical circumflex branches of the middle cerebral artery, as compared with findings in the lenticulostriate artery of the same diameter. Densely distributed perivascular nerve fibers in the lenticulostriate arteries may play an important role in the pathogenesis of intracerebral hemorrhage.\r"

The authors experienced a case in which the CRC was kept in place for twenty-four hours for anticoagulant therapy of an occluded coronary artery following failure of PTCA. This case suggests that adequate anticoagulant therapy can prolong the period during which a CRC can be kept in place if emergency coronary bypass surgery cannot be performed immediately after failure of coronary angioplasty.\r"

The authors studied by means of a treadmill exercise test the pain-free walking distance (PFWD), the global walking distance (GWD), and the recovery time after exercise. The treatment period was completed by 290 patients: 204 claudicants, 51 claudicants with diabetes, and 35 with a short PFWD and GWD (greater than 150 m). Indobufen was more effective than ASA in improving the PFWD and GWD in all groups. There were also fewer side effects with indobufen, and cardiac morbidity and mortality was also reduced. In conclusion indobufen showed its activity and safety in chronic treatment of patients with peripheral disease, and we suggest that it may be used for long periods without side effects.\r"

The causes in both Group A and Group B included respectively: effort or spontaneous 28 per cent and 29 per cent, catheter insertion related 17 per cent and 47 per cent, and malignancy or systemic disease 55 per cent and 24 per cent. None of the patients in Group A had noninvasive vascular testing (NIT). However, 27 patients in Group B had IPG/duplex imaging (NIT). All 18 cases in Group A and 27 cases in Group B were treated conventionally (anticoagulants). Seventy-three per cent of these had residual pain on exertion (venous claudication) and/or swelling. Fourteen of these cases had posttreatment NIT/venography. Four of these showed total resolution of the thrombus and all were symptom free. Ten had no resolution, and nine were symptomatic. Seven cases in Group B were treated with thrombolytic therapy. Five of these had total resolution of thrombus and were symptom free (71%). Two had no resolution with residual symptoms (29%) (statistically significant). In conclusion (1) More patients with axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis seen recently are catheter insertion related; 2) Diagnosis should be initiated with duplex imaging; and (3) Thrombolytic therapy significantly decreased residual symptoms and yielded better resolution than anticoagulants.\r"

The median age was 51 years. Thirty-one splenectomies (67.4%) were performed for malignancy (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11; chronic myelogenous leukemia, 10; lymphoma, 9; hairy cell leukemia, 1), 11 for myeloid metaplasia, and four for other nonmalignant conditions. Indications for splenectomy included hypersplenism (32 patients), symptoms (6), diagnosis (3), and splenic rupture (3). A midline incision (30 patients) was most commonly used. Median operative time was 2 hours, 50 minutes. Median operative blood loss was 1,300 ml (range, 100 ml-60 units). The splenic artery was ligated initially in 16 patients (34.8%) but did not correlate with blood loss or operating time. The median splenic weight was 2,030 grams (range, 1500-5320 gm). The postoperative complication rate was 39.1 per cent (21 complications in 18 patients). This included infection in 10 patients, bleeding in six patients. Six patients required reoperation (bleeding, 4; abscess, 1; small bowel obstruction, 1 patient). The 30-day operative mortality was 19.6 per cent (9 patients). Excluding operative deaths, 35 patients were available for follow-up evaluation. Twenty-nine patients had improvement in parameters for which splenectomy was indicated. Six patients had no change in their course after splenectomy. These findings indicate that many patients with massive splenomegaly benefit from splenectomy, however, the procedure is associated with a high risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fourteen patients received a combined cadaveric pancreas/renal transplant with bladder drainage. One patient received a second pancreas transplant 24 hours after the first pancreas graft failed due to portal vein thrombosis. One patient received a pancreas graft 3 years after kidney transplantation. Complications included five cases of hematuria, two bladder leaks, two wound infections, one cytomegalovirus pneumonia, three cases of graft pancreatitis, one pseudocyst, one urine reflux pancreatitis requiring conversion to pancreatico-enterostomy, and two late deaths. Average time to discharge was 17 days following transplant, with 2.9 re-hospitalizations per patient and an average of 38 in-hospital days during the first 6-12 months. Seventeen rejection episodes occurred in 12 patients, diagnosed by declining urine amylase and pH and/or finding of rejection on kidney biopsy. Patient and kidney graft survival is 87 per cent. Pancreas graft survival is 81 per cent (1-20 months follow-up). All patients are insulin-independent and normoglycemic. Mean glycosylated hemoglobin concentration is 4.0 +/- 0.9 post-transplant vs. 7.5 +/- 0.6 pretransplant. Mean serum creatinine is 1.4 +/- 0.7 mg/dl. A new program of pancreas transplantation can be successful in carefully selected diabetic patients, with special attention to avoidance of preservation injury to the pancreas during multiorgan donor procurement. Combined pancreatic/renal transplantation is believed to be the therapeutic treatment of choice in Type I diabetic patients who have impaired renal function and have no significant cardiovascular disease.\r"

Yet, early diagnosis of this disease with its various presentations remains a difficult task. A 10-year review at our hospital identified 38 patients with colonic ischemia for comparison with the authors' previous experience and with data from the literature. Several important factors emerge: (1) Twice as many cases occurred after operations (34% in this series vs. 16% in the past), probably because fewer and fewer spontaneous cases were hospitalized. (2) Sixteen patients required operative intervention for colonic ischemia with a mortality of 62 per cent, while those treated nonoperatively had a mortality of 14 per cent. Seven of eight postoperative patients who required a second operative procedure for their colonic ischemia died. A high clinical suspicion is necessary in the postoperative patient, as colonic ischemia appears to be more severe among these patients. Moreover, the high incidence of associated cardiovascular disease indicates that early diagnosis, as well as monitoring of the \"at-risk\" patient, is needed for improvement in survival to occur. New monitoring methods, such as tonometry, may help accomplish this goal.\r"

On the morning following surgery, all patients were weaned by IMV to a rate of eight breaths per minute, tidal volume of 12 ml/kg and inspired oxygen concentration of 40 per cent. With patients awake and able to breath spontaneously, PSV was begun at 20 cm of water. In patients with static lung compliance, less than 0.06 l/cm H2O, 30 cm H2O of PSV was used. Subsequently, all patients were weaned to PSV 10 cm of water, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 5 cm water and extubated. Hemodynamic data including oxygen transport were obtained at each level of PSV and at IMV prior to weaning. Analysis using ANOVA showed comparable hemodynamic and oxygen transport parameters for PSV of 30 cm H2O in comparison with IMV. PSV at levels of 20 and 10 cm H2O produced statistically significant increases in heart rate, mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Cardiac output was stable, and these increases were not clinically significant. In awake patients following cardiac surgery, PSV up to 30 cm H2O can be safely applied without hemodynamic embarrassment in patients with good left ventricular ejection fractions.\r"

DPL in 68 patients was positive by gross inspection; 18 of these 68 patients' DPL laboratory results returned after surgery and did not satisfy the laboratory definition of positive DPL. In all 61 per cent underwent therapeutic celiotomy (TC) and 39 per cent underwent nontherapeutic celiotomy (NTC). Grade I and II spleen and/or liver injuries led to 79 per cent of NTCs. Positive DPL, determined by gross inspection or by laboratory testing, has a very poor accuracy rate when evaluated in light of evolving beliefs that promote nonoperative therapy for grade I and II liver and spleen injuries. When positive DPL is the sole indication for celiotomy in patients with blunt or stab abdominal trauma, an unacceptably large number of NTCs will be performed. DPL should have a limited role in the evaluation of patients with abdominal trauma.\r"

In the present study, the response of cholestatic rats to a bacterial challenge was investigated and the uptake of bacteria by their Kupffer cells was examined with the electron microscope. Rats underwent bile duct ligation (BDL, n = 8) of sham celiotomy (SC, n = 8) and were allowed to recover for 10 days. They were then injected with 10(9) Staphylococcus aureus IV and killed at intervals of 15, 30, 60, and 180 minutes after injection. Two from each group were killed at each interval. Quantitative blood cultures were performed, and specimens of liver and lung were obtained for quantitative bacterial culture and processed for electron microscopy. Bacteria were rapidly cleared from the bloodstream of SC animals but persisted in BDL rats. Electron microscopy consistently demonstrated bacteria within Kupffer cell phagocytic vesicles of both SC and BDL animals at each interval selected. There was no morphologic difference in these vesicles between the two groups. Bacteremia persists in BDL rats subjected to a bacterial challenge despite rapid uptake of bacteria in apparently normal phagocytic vesicles. This study suggests a defect in intracellular killing of bacteria, an impairment of delivery of bacteria to RE cells, or a combination of these factors.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative fine needle aspiration biopsy (NAB) of undiagnosed pancreatic masses was studied in 166 patients over a 17-year period. The cytologic diagnoses were correlated with histologic specimens, autopsy results, or clinical follow-up (benign disease was documented if the patient was alive without malignancy at least 2 years after laparotomy). Aspirates were interpreted as benign, suspicious, malignant, or unsatisfactory. Malignant disease was the final diagnosis in 109 patients; the cytology was concordant in 101 and was interpreted as suspicious in four. Four patients with benign cytology later proved to have malignant disease--a false-negative rate of 2.5 per cent. A total of 57 patients had benign disease; 51 of these had benign cytology. The remaining patients had \"unsatisfactory\" cytology reports. A 93 per cent sensitivity, 100 per cent specificity, and 0 per cent complication rate are reported. There were no false-positive cytology reports. Complications are rare and represent case reports, thus, additional sampling is at minimal risk. Intraoperative pancreatic NAB is a safe, easy, more accurate biopsy technique than historical wedge or core needle biopsies. It is the biopsy method of choice for pancreatic masses found at laparotomy.\r"

The effect of OKY-046, a TX synthetase inhibitor, on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) production of superoxide anion (O2-) as determined by ferricytochrome reduction was examined. Fourteen dogs were subjected to 6 hours of bilateral gracilis muscle ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. O2- production from resting PMNs and PMNs stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OZ, 0.1 mg/ml) was measured prior to ischemia or drug treatment (baseline), and following reperfusion in both treated (n = 7) and control groups (n = 7). Serum TX levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay. Following reperfusion, TX levels in the treated group were decreased as compared with the control group (18 +/- 2 pg/ml vs. 72 +/- 26 pg/ml, P less than 0.05). Superoxide production by both resting and stimulated PMNs was also decreased in the treated group; from 0.98 +/- 0.16 nmol to 0.43 +/- 0.12 nmol O2- in the resting state (P less than 0.05) and from 13.3 +/- 1.5 nmol to 9.0 +/- 1.1 nmol O2- after stimulation (P less than 0.005). O2- production was increased in the control group following reperfusion as compared with baseline samples, and this increase was attenuated by treatment with OKY-046. TX synthetase inhibition decreases activation of PMNs following hindlimb ischemia.\r"

Three different techniques of determining whether vascular prosthetic grafts were infected using a dog model were evaluated. Aortic angiograms were compared with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging and systemic norepinephrine (NE) kinetics to determine if either newer technique would be more reliable than standard angiograms. Twelve dogs were randomized to control (n = 6) or infected groups (n = 6). All dogs had a 5 cm section of their infrarenal aorta replaced with knitted Dacron vascular prosthetic graft. The grafts in the infected group were contaminated by soaking them in a broth containing S. epidermidis. NE production and clearance rates were calculated for all animals after an infusion of 3H-NE using the steady-state radionuclide tracer methodology. One week following graft insertion, dogs were reanesthetized, and the 3H-NE infusion and measurements were repeated. Standard angiograms and NMR imaging were also performed. Once all tests were performed, the prosthetic grafts were removed for cultures. Comparisons between the initial and final norepinephrine measurements for each group were made using the nonparametric Wilcoxon two-sample test, while comparisons between the groups were made by chi square or the Student's t test. Angiogram results were similar for control and infected animals. Angiograms missed disruption of the proximal anastomosis found in three of the six infected dogs at graft removal. None of the six control animals, while five of the six infected animals, had localized areas of high signal intensity on NMR imaging (P less than 0.01) suggesting abscess formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Recent work has demonstrated that oxygen-free radicals (OFR) generated during sepsis contribute to the pathogenesis of this syndrome. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of various new free radical scavengers on survival in sepsis. A total of 85 male Sprague-Dawley rats were placed into one of the following treatment groups. CONTROL: cecal ligation and puncture (CLP); PRE-AT: pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol (AT) 10 mg/100 gm SC x 3 days, and 5 mg/100 gm IV prior to CLP; AT: 20 mg/100 gm at time of CLP and 4 hours following CLP; U74006F: (21-aminosteroid which inhibits lipid peroxidation) 3 mg/kg IV at the time of and 4 hours following CLP; U78517F: (alpha-tocopherol analogue) 3 mg/kg at the time of and 4 hours following CLP. Survival was determined at various time points up to 72 hours. Pretreatment with AT resulted in improved survival, whereas the novel OFR scavengers U78517F and U74006F significantly improved survival and were efficacious without pretreatment. It was concluded that OFR scavengers can improve survival in sepsis.\r"

To evaluate its success, the Emory University Affiliated Hospital experience from February 1984 to March 1989 was retrospectively reviewed. There were a total of 50 patients identified; 84 per cent had ulcerative colitis, and 16 per cent had polyposis coli (familial polyposis and Gardner's syndrome). The majority of these patients underwent a two-stage operation, but one-third required a three-stage procedure due to difficulty in mucosal proctectomy or toxic megacolon. J-pouch construction was performed in 72 per cent of patients, S-pouch construction in 14 per cent, straight ileo-anal anastomosis in 8 per cent, and lateral isoperistaltic ileo-anal anastomosis in 6 per cent. Of the 50 patients, 36 (72%) have had closure of the temporary ileostomy. Fourteen patients have not had ileostomy closure due to change in diagnosis to Crohn's disease, operative complications, or ileostomy closure pending. The combined operative morbidity per patient for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and the closure of the ileostomy was 32 per cent. This included bowel obstruction, 16 per cent; pelvic abscess, 6 per cent; and ileo-anal separation, 4 per cent. Follow-up on patients with ileostomy closure ranged from 6 months to 4 years (mean, 1.3 years). Stool frequency was 5.9 stools per 24 hours at 6 months and improved with time. During the follow-up period, all patients were eventually completely continent of stool during the day, and most became completely continent of stool at night.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It was shown that advanced age and the presence of multiple medical problems do not predispose to higher levels of limb loss. Although diabetic patients more frequently undergo amputation because of sepsis than their nondiabetic counterparts, the diabetic state was not found to be associated with a greater likelihood of above knee (AK) procedures. Prior arterial surgery was not shown to make AK amputation more likely, but it was disconcerting to note that limb salvage was not achieved in many individuals despite patent proximal inflow revascularization procedures. This initial study showed that several presumed risk factors were not predictors of amputation level. Those patients requiring AK amputations had a greater frequency of combined segment (aortoiliac and femoropopliteal) occlusive disease than those who had successful amputations at more distal levels. A follow-up study of 41 consecutive patients presenting with tissue loss due to combined segment occlusive disease was performed. Eighteen (Group I) underwent inflow procedures only, while 23 (Group II) also underwent distal revascularization. The groups were similar with respect to age, risk factors, extent of tissue loss and sepsis. At 1 year 10 (56%) Group I and only 3 (13%) Group II patients required major amputation (P = 0.01). Distal bypass, in addition to an inflow procedure, is recommended for those who present with tissue loss due to multilevel arterial occlusion.\r"

DESIGN: An observational study of a prospectively identified cohort. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Two hundred and eighty patients with essential hypertension and no pre-existing cardiac disease were evaluated using echocardiography between 1976 and 1981. Two hundred and fifty-three subjects or their family members (90%) were contacted for a follow-up interview an average of 10.2 years after the initial echocardiogram was obtained; the survival status of 27 patients lost to follow-up was ascertained using National Death Index data. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Left ventricular mass exceeded 125 g/m2 in 69 of 253 patients (27%). Cardiovascular events occurred in a higher proportion of patients with than without left ventricular hypertrophy (26% compared with 12%; P = 0.006). Patients with increased ventricular mass were also at higher risk for cardiovascular death (14% compared with 0.5%; P less than 0.001) and all-cause mortality (16% compared with 2%; P = 0.001). Electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy did not predict risk. Patients with normal left ventricular geometry had the fewest adverse outcomes (no cardiac deaths; morbid events in 11%), and those with concentric hypertrophy had the most (death in 21%; morbid events in 31%). In a multivariate analysis, only age and left ventricular mass--but not gender, blood pressure, or serum cholesterol level--independently predicted all three outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Echocardiographically determined left ventricular mass and geometry stratify risk in patients with essential hypertension independently of and more strongly than blood pressure or other potentially reversible risk factors and may help to stratify the need for intensive treatment.\r"

DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled, 13-week clinical trial with follow-up of patients in an open trial of methotrexate at the conclusion of the double-blind study. SETTING: An asthma care outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: From February 1988 to March 1990, 19 patients with severe, steroid-dependent asthma were enrolled in the study. Two of these patients were excluded from analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were administered methotrexate or placebo intramuscularly, to assure complete absorption, once weekly during the 13-week study. RESULTS: Patients on methotrexate and placebo both significantly decreased their steroid dose by 39.6% (95% CI, 25.1% to 54.1%, P = 0.001) and 40.2% (CI, 17.9% to 67.4%, P = 0.003), respectively. Pulmonary function did not differ significantly between the methotrexate and placebo groups. In addition, airway reactivity and symptom scores were unchanged on methotrexate or placebo. No significant toxicities were seen during the course of the 13-week blinded study, but one patient on methotrexate and prednisone in the follow-up period developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died. Despite continuing methotrexate for up to 1 year, and increasing methotrexate to 30 mg weekly, no significant benefit of methotrexate on asthma control could be shown. CONCLUSION: Our study does not support the use of methotrexate in the treatment of severe asthma.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of an elevated (greater than 30 mm/h) Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) for predicting early relapse and survival after therapy in patients with clinical stage I or II Hodgkin disease. INTERVENTIONS: We studied 772 patients with early-stage Hodgkin disease who had participated in two separate multicenter clinical trials. Both trials used modern field radiotherapy and, in some patients, multi-agent chemotherapy. MAIN RESULTS: The ESR patterns were based on pretherapy and post-therapy assessments: pattern 1, always normal (n = 261); pattern 2, elevated before therapy but normal immediately after therapy (n = 121); pattern 3, elevated before therapy but normal within 3 months after therapy (n = 89); pattern 4, always elevated (n = 48); pattern 5, normal before therapy but oscillating between normal and elevated after therapy (n = 150); pattern 6, elevated before therapy but oscillating between normal and elevated after therapy (n = 130). By multivariate analysis, independent of whether or not patients received chemotherapy in the initial therapy protocol, ESR patterns 4, 5, and 6 were shown to be the best predictors for early relapse and survival when patients were stratified according to the type of chemotherapy received and the number of involved nodal areas. Patients with ESR pattern 4 had a relative risk for death seven times that of patients with patterns 1, 2, or 3. Early relapse was the second most important factor predicting death, irrespective of ESR; patients with early relapse and ESR patterns 1, 2, or 3 had a relative risk for death of 4.5, and those with early relapse and ESR patterns 4, 5, or 6 had a relative risk for death of 15. Whether or not chemotherapy was given initially did not change the relative risk, which shows that ESR, not initial therapy, was the predictor for early relapse and death due to Hodgkin disease. CONCLUSION: An unexplained elevated ESR after therapy, especially after modern radiotherapy, independent of other factors, strongly suggest the presence of aggressive and resistant Hodgkin disease. An elevated ESR is predictive of early relapse and poor prognosis; its presence justifies early aggressive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate occult enteric infections and morphologic changes in the small intestine in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and chronic diarrhea of undefined cause. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Referral-based clinic and hospital in tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with advanced HIV infection (19 with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], 3 with AIDS-related complex) with chronic diarrhea, selected because of previously negative stool evaluations for bacterial or parasitic pathogens, were compared with 13 patients with advanced HIV infection (9 with AIDS, 4 with AIDS-related complex) without diarrhea by analysis of endoscopic biopsies using light and electron microscopy, viral culture, and morphometric studies. Both groups were convenience samples and had at least 7 months follow-up. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Eleven of twenty-two patients with HIV infection and chronic diarrhea but only 1 of 13 patients without diarrhea showed occult enteric pathogens (that is, undetected by routine studies) after extensive evaluation of duodenal and colorectal biopsies. Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare and microsporidia were the most common occult agents in study patients with diarrhea (5 each). Patients with diarrhea and occult enteric infections had greater weight loss (mean, 14.3 kg compared with 6.2 kg; P less than 0.05) and shorter survival (1 of 11 compared with 8 of 11 still alive; P less than 0.004) than those with diarrhea but no identified pathogens (defined as \"AIDS enteropathy\"). Duodenal morphometry showed decreased villus-to-crypt ratios because of villus atrophy and crypt elongation in HIV-infected patients both with and without diarrhea compared with normal controls (P less than 0.001 for each). All three groups showed comparable frequencies of epithelial mitoses. CONCLUSIONS: Further endoscopic biopsy evaluation of patients with AIDS who had unexplained chronic diarrhea showed an occult infectious cause in half of the cases. However, altered villus and crypt architecture in advanced HIV infection was independent of the presence of diarrhea or enteric infection and therefore did not correlate with AIDS enteropathy. Subnormal epithelial proliferation in response to injury could be a factor, but the underlying cause of the architectural changes remains obscure. We suggest that T-cell dysfunction may play a role.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if central sympathetic outflow is increased in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. PATIENTS: Eleven patients with cirrhosis and ascites, 8 patients with cirrhosis but without ascites, and 7 age-matched and 8 young healthy volunteers. METHODS: With subjects supine, direct microneurographic recordings of efferent post-ganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity were obtained from the peroneal nerve, and sympathetic burst frequency was compared with subjects' blood pressure, heart rate, sodium excretion, catecholamines, and plasma renin activity. All patients with cirrhosis were studied at least 5 days after withdrawal from all medications and after 7 days of a 20 mmol/d sodium, 1-L fluid-restricted diet. Age-matched volunteers were studied after 7 days of 20 mmol/d sodium intake and young healthy volunteers after 7 days of 150 mmol/d sodium intake. RESULTS: Sympathetic nerve activity in ascitic patients (65 +/- 15 bursts/min; mean +/- SD) was markedly increased, whether compared with patients with cirrhosis but without ascites (34 +/- 16 bursts/min; P less than 0.001), age-matched healthy volunteers on similar sodium intake (27 +/- 22 bursts/min; P less than 0.001), or young healthy subjects (21 +/- 10 bursts/min; P less than 0.001). The frequency of muscle sympathetic nerve discharge was directly related to plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations, plasma renin activity, and heart rate, all of which were increased in those patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and inversely related to 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, the fractional excretion of sodium, and subjects' pulse pressures. Sympathetic nerve activity fell from 78 to 6 bursts/min in one patient after liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first direct evidence that elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations in patients with cirrhosis and ascites are due to increased central sympathetic outflow. Sympathetic nerve activity is not increased in patients with cirrhosis but without ascites. Because there were direct positive correlations of sympathetic nerve activity with plasma norepinephrine concentrations, plasma epinephrine concentrations, plasma renin activity, and heart rate, the increase in central sympathetic outflow in patients with cirrhosis and ascites appears generalized and not restricted to muscle nerves. The anti-natriuretic effects of parallel increases in renal and muscle sympathetic nerve activity could account for the inverse correlation between muscle sympathetic nerve activity and sodium excretion.\r"

SETTING: A referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a medical school. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had at least one relapse in a 2-year period after entry into the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (measuring life events), the Beck Depression Inventory (a visual analog scale for depressed mood) and an inventory of intestinal symptoms were completed monthly by each subject with a 78% rate of compliance. A mean of 2.2 exacerbations was seen per subject during the study period. Life events were not temporally associated with changes in intestinal symptoms. Significant associations were found between intestinal symptoms and the two mood scales (P less than 0.05 for each), but no directionality in symptom occurrence could be detected in a time-lagged analysis. The results were similar when the months preceding exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings suggest that mood changed concurrently with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, no evidence indicated that stressful life events or depressed mood precipitated exacerbations in this study group.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize an unusual mode of presentation of systemic lupus erythematosus: acute and severe pancytopenia related to reactive hemophagocytosis. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Two general community hospitals in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Six patients presenting with a reactive hemophagocytic syndrome, identified over a 3.5 year period, diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus according to the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association. RESULTS: In addition to severe pancytopenia and marrow hemophagocytosis, other characteristic features were fever, hypocomplementemia, high antinuclear antibody titer, and cutaneous and visceral vasculitis. There was no evidence of an underlying infection. The pancytopenia responded dramatically to treatment with steroids. CONCLUSION: Recognition of the acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome and distinction from an infection-associated hemophagocytic syndrome is important because it responds well to steroid therapy. The evaluation of patients presenting with a hemophagocytic syndrome should include serologic tests for systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability and validity of \"standardized patients\" to assess clinical performance of internal medicine residents. DESIGN: Each resident spent 2 half-days interacting with 19 standardized patients (nonphysicians taught to portray patients in a reproducible fashion). Each resident was asked to obtain focused histories, perform relevant physical examinations, and provide patient education or counseling. At the end of each 10- to 15-minute encounter, the resident was asked to identify positive findings on physical examination and to prioritize a differential diagnosis. Other, more traditional indicators of clinical skills were also obtained. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred ten residents from nineteen internal medicine training programs in the New England region of the United States. RESULTS: Reproducible estimates of data gathering and interviewing skills were achieved with 1 day of testing. Validity analyses were difficult to interpret because of the lack of an external \"gold standard.\" However, faculty judgments of performance from reviewing videotapes corresponded with standardized-patient-based scores. Differences in group performance were also demonstrated across years of training and between U.S. or Canadian and foreign medical graduates. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic and effective procedures for developing standardized-patient-based test materials and for training standardized patients have been developed. This technique is best used for measuring data gathering and interviewing skills. Correlations with commonly used evaluation methods were generally low; this may be because standardized patients measure different skills. Local use of this technique by residency programs and the development of regional consortia sharing resources, costs, and expertise are advocated.\r"

Relative erythropoietin deficiency is the proximate cause. Recombinant human erythropoietin recently became available for research and clinical use. Erythropoietin production is regulated by a single copy gene located on chromosome 7; its expression has been shown in the kidney, liver, and macrophages. It is glycosylated protein of 166 amino acids with a molecular weight of 34,000 D. When given to patients with the anemia of renal failure, erythropoietin causes a dose-dependent rise in hematocrit to the normal range within 8 to 14 weeks. Complications of this response are minimal except for a significant incidence of hypertension. When the anemia is corrected, the patient's quality of life, cognitive function, and brain electrophysiology improve dramatically. Recombinant human erythropoietin represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure. Current reimbursement constraints limit its full application.\r"

Overall acceptance of TT catheter use was high and only 5 subjects elected to discontinue use. We believe the TT route is a relatively safe approach for oxygen administration and a promising method of improving patient compliance. It also offers the potential of more adequately oxygenating patients with refractory hypoxemia.\r"

The incidence of wound breakdown requiring removal of the package was 0.6% in Hannover and 1.0% in Melbourne. The complications for the operation at both clinics were at acceptable levels. It was considered that wound breakdown requiring implant removal could be kept to a minimum by making a generous incision and suturing the flap without tension.\r"

A biopsy of the intraosseous portion of the ES was obtained during a translabyrinthine approach to section the vestibular nerve in the internal acoustic meatus. The material consisted mainly of tubular epithelial structures filled with heavily stained material. Pathologically dilated and degranulated rough endoplasmic reticuli and disaggregation of polyribosomes with accumulation of solitary ribosomes in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum suggested a disturbed epithelial cell protein synthesis. Ultrastructural evidence of an increased merocrine secretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES was noted. This made it possible to analyze the presumed intracellular secretory pathways. An increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and monocytes was observed. Since the inner ear had been subjected to surgical intervention before the vestibular nerve section, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether the patient's symptoms were related to the disturbed protein metabolism and hypersecretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES. The findings support earlier experimental results that indicate that the ES has not only a resorptive function but also a secretory one.\r"

The epithelium of normal external ear canal skin was lightly stained, but the staining was much weaker than that of the cholesteatomas observed. In vitro, recombinant mouse TNF-alpha stimulated proliferation, protein synthesis, and terminal differentiation of basal keratinocytes. These stimulatory effects were blocked by the anti-TNF-alpha immunoglobulin G, which by itself had no effect on basal keratinocytes. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha plays an important role in the development of cholesteatomas seen clinically.\r"

Over the past 5 years we have used botulinum toxin (BOTOX) to treat more than 200 patients with laryngeal dystonia. This group includes patients with adductor involvement (phonatory dystonia, recurrent laryngeal nerve section failure, respiratory dystonia) and those with abductor involvement (whispering dystonia). Patients received benefit within 24 to 72 hours, with sustained improvement for 2 to 9 months with an average of 4 months. Patients improved to an average of 90% of normal function. Clinically significant adverse effects included extended breathy dysphonia and mild choking on fluids. BOTOX has become our treatment of choice for dystonic conditions of the larynx.\r"

For success in the airway and voice results, the salient points in surgery include 1) precise midline thyrotomy, 2) shaping of the vocal cord under fiberoptic control, and 3) mucosa grafting with the combined use of a pliable stent or fibrin glue for fixation.\r"

Acute effects of m-xylene were studied in nine voluntary subjects exposed experimentally to stable or varying concentrations of m-xylene at rest or while exercising. Each subject participated in four exposure and two control sessions in a single-blind fashion. The time-weighted average (TWA) m-xylene concentration was always 200 parts per million (ppm) (8.2 mumol/l) during the 4-h exposure period, complying to a TWA of 4.1 mumol/l.8 h, which is equivalent to the hygienic limit allowed in work situations. The short-term peak concentrations were 400 ppm or less. Electroencephalography was recorded at the beginning of exposure, during exposure, and after exposure was stopped. Eighteen 60-s EEG samples for each subject on each experimental day were analyzed automatically. Exercise increased theta percentage and delta power and percentage; these changes were more prominent in the control session without exposure. Exposure increased the dominant alpha frequency and alpha percentage during the early phase of exposure and also counteracted the effects of exercise. The effects of short-term m-xylene exposure on EEG were minor, and no deleterious effects were noted. Perhaps alpha activation is indicative of stimulating and excitatory effects induced by m-xylene exposure, which has been noted heretofore in the absorption phase of alcohol intake.\r"

Even though damp surfaces supported large populations of bacteria and yeasts, the air concentrations in the kitchen and bathroom were similar to those in other rooms. No changes in concentrations or types of microbiological contamination were observed between the first and second years of occupancy, but elevated outdoor humidity, lower air temperature, and winds from the northeast were associated with higher bacterial and fungal air concentrations. The median air concentrations of bacteria were 98 cfu/m3 (95% confidence interval 26-372 cfu/m3) indoors and 101 cfu/m3 (28-364 cfu/m3) outdoors. The median air concentrations of fungi were 198 cfu/m3 (58-673 cfu/m3) indoors and 362 cfu/m3 (113-1158 cfu/m3) outdoors.

  ".W": "We investigated the possible adverse health effects to sheet-metal workers who had past exposure to asbestos. A cross-sectional medical examination of 1,330 workers was conducted during 1986 and 1987 in seven cities in the United States and Canada. A total of 1,016 workers had been employed for at least 35 y in the industry, and the mean duration from onset of asbestos exposure was 39.5 y (SD = 7.41 y). Chest x-ray abnormalities were found in more than half of the group. Pleural fibrosis, the most frequently found abnormality, was present in 47.0% of the cases and was the only abnormality found in 27.8% of cases; parenchymal interstitial fibrosis, found in 33.1% of cases, was the only abnormality found in 16.2% of cases. Radiologic abnormalities increased as duration of exposure increased. A positive smoking history was associated with a higher prevalence of radiologically detectable parenchymal abnormalities, a finding confirmed by us and others. Dyspnea on exertion was graded by a Medical Research Council questionnaire, the examinee's self-assessment, and a more detailed 12-point scale questionnaire. Few persons had marked shortness of breath, and approximately one-third had slight dyspnea. Individuals who had radiologic abnormalities experienced more shortness of breath than did those who had no radiologic abnormalities. Cigarette smoking also resulted in a higher prevalence of dyspnea. The results indicate that during the past, construction sheet-metal workers have been significantly exposed to asbestos on the job. Every effort should be made to minimize the anticipated serious health consequences, and further asbestos exposure for those who continue in this trade should be avoided.\r"

This ecological study investigated the association between U.S. county forage selenium status and site- and sex-specific county cancer mortality rates (1950-1969) using weighted least squares regression. Consistent, significant (p less than .01) inverse associations were observed for cancers of the lung, rectum, bladder, esophagus, and cervix in a model limited to rural counties and for cancers of the lung, breast, rectum, bladder, esophagus, and corpus uteri in a model of all counties. No consistent significant positive associations were observed in the rural county models. This remarkable degree of consistency for the inverse associations strengthens the likelihood of a causal relationship between low selenium status and an increased risk of cancer mortality.\r"

Bone Gla-protein also correlated significantly with urinary beta 2-microglobulin in the men and with serum creatinine in the women. Serum BGP values strongly reflect the degree of bone damage and also reflect, although less strongly, the degree of renal damage induced by exposure to Cd.\r"

After 3 wk exposure, the thymocyte percentages were higher in ozone-exposed mice, whereas the absolute number remained lower, and spleen T lymphocytes showed no changes.

Three patients (25%) died of tumor recurrence and three (25%) died of other causes. Unifocal and intrahepatic tumors were associated with better prognosis compared to the multifocal tumors and tumors with extrahepatic spread (p = 0.04 and 0.13). Microscopically vascular invasion and the predominance of embryonal and/or anaplastic epithelium were associated with a poor prognosis compared to the tumors with no vascular invasion and with predominantly fetal epithelium (p = 0.08 and 0.1). It is concluded that continued efforts to treat unresectable hepatoblastomas by liver transplantation is justified and the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in improving the results needs to be better defined.\r"

  ".W": "The natural history of Barrett's esophagus, particularly the prevalence and incidence of malignant changes in it, remains controversial. Furthermore the prognosis of surgically treated patients with carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus has not been elucidated fully. To examine these and other issues, the records of 65 patients with carcinoma in Barrett's esophagus presenting at the Lahey Clinic Medical Center from January 1973 to January 1989 were reviewed. During this period, 241 patients with documented Barrett's esophagus were seen, for a prevalence of carcinoma of 27%. Adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus accounted for 30% of the surgically treated carcinomas of the thoracic esophagus during this period. All but four of these patients were men. Symptoms of chronic reflux were present in less than one half of the patients and dysphagia was often the presenting symptom. In eight patients the carcinoma was discovered on routine surveillance endoscopy, and in four patients progression of disease from benign columnar epithelium to dysplasia to carcinoma was documented. Tumors developed in six patients who had undergone previous antireflux surgery, and in four other patients a second carcinoma developed in residual Barrett's epithelium after a previous resection. Of the 65 patients, 61 (94%) were considered to have operable disease, all of whom underwent resection. Two patients (3.3%) died within 30 days of operation. The resected specimens were staged as follows: stage 0, 4; stage I, 10; stage II, 17; stage III, 25; stage IV, 4. Of the resected specimens, 73% showed areas of dysplasia adjacent to the tumor. The overall adjusted actuarial 5-year survival rate was 23.7%. The 3-year survival rate was 100% for patients with stage 0 carcinoma, 85.7% for patients with stage I carcinoma, 53.6% for patients with stage IIA carcinoma, 45% for patients with stage IIB carcinoma, 25.2% for patients with stage III carcinoma, and 0% for patients with stage IV carcinoma. The premalignant nature of Barrett's esophagus requires endoscopic surveillance to detect early carcinoma because symptoms often occur late or are absent. Antireflux surgery does not protect against the development of carcinoma. All of the Barrett's epithelium must be resected because a second carcinoma may develop in residual columnar epithelium. Severe dysplasia should be considered an indication for resection. Although operability and resectability rates are high, long-term survival is not. Early detection is mandatory if long-term survival is to be achieved.\r"

These patients were compared with a group of 91 consecutive patients who had mastectomy without preoperative chemotherapy. Strict operative criteria were used to determine the timing of mastectomy following chemotherapy. Wound infection rates were no different in the preoperative chemotherapy group compared to the mastectomy-alone groups (7% versus 4%; p = 0.62). The incidence of wound necrosis was similar (11% versus 6%; p = 0.29). Seroma formation was decreased significantly in the preoperative chemotherapy group compared to the mastectomy-alone group (15% versus 28%; p = 0.04). Intensive preoperative chemotherapy did not delay the reinstitution of postoperative treatment (30% versus 20%; p = 0.27). However, when delay in instituting postoperative chemotherapy was more than 30 days, there was a significant decrease in overall survival rate (p = 0.04). This study provides evidence that intensive preoperative chemotherapy and mastectomy can be performed without increased morbidity. Furthermore it is important to institute systemic chemotherapy within 30 days of mastectomy to achieve maximum survival.\r"

There was an improvement in the predictive capacity of the APACHE II + DTH equation compared to APACHE II alone, as shown by a better fit of expected and observed deaths, an improved Goodman-Kruskal G statistic, and a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. It is concluded that the DTH response (a broad marker of immunocompetence) is an independent prognostic factor in surgical patients and can be used in combination with the APACHE II score (a measure of acute physiology) to estimate better the outcome of surgical patients.\r"

Causes of procurement failure in 126 patients who died principally from their head injuries included failure of initial resuscitation (14%), ineligibility (28%), failure of physiologic support (14%), and denial of consent (20%). Of 73 eligible donors, 29 (41%) were able to donate one or more vascular organs (heart, liver, kidney). In only one instance was an eligible donor not appropriately identified as such. Failure of physiologic support to prevent early death (25%), and denial of consent (34%) were found to be the two major, potentially remediable causes of procurement failure in this series. Based on this data, an estimated 29 patients/million population/year will survive initially and meet all eligibility requirements for organ donation. Data on 47 kidneys transplanted from the donor group demonstrated a 77% overall graft survival rate at a follow-up period averaging 23 months. Prolonged donor hypotension, but not the use of high-dose vasopressors, adversely affected allograft survival. The current limitations of organ procurement in victims of fatal head injury stem from a limited ability to maintain cardiopulmonary function long enough for the procurement process to be completed and a high overall rate (46%) of denial of consent for organ harvest by next of kin.\r"

All patients had a diverting intestinal stoma either as part of the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. Each of the patients had low or mid septal fistulae; high fistulae generally are treated transabdominally and are not the focus of this discussion. Fistulae were eradicated in 12 of the 13 women and did not recur during the follow-up period, which averaged 50 months (range, 9 to 68 months). The only treatment failure was a patient who had a markedly diseased colon from the cecum to the rectum and a very low-lying fistula. It is concluded that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulae secondary to Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose metabolism and insulin secretion after pancreas transplantation may be affected by the technique used for ductal drainage. We evaluated peripheral glucose and insulin levels after oral (oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) and sustained stable hyperglycemic challenge (clamp) in dogs who had undergone pancreas autotransplantation with intraperitoneal drainage (PAT) or with urinary bladder to pancreatic duct anastomosis (PAT/B). Both groups had basal glucose values comparable to normal controls; PAT/B animals had fasting hyperinsulinemia. Pancreas autotransplantation animals had an increased integrated glucose response to OGTT and blunted insulin response to hyperglycemic clamp. Urinary bladder to pancreatic duct anastomosis animals had a significantly decreased integrated glucose response to OGTT compared to PAT and an exaggerated insulin response to hyperglycemic challenge, which approximated normal control values by the last 30-minute period of the clamp. Interestingly M values, which approximate glucose metabolized during the hyperglycemic challenge, were depressed in both surgical groups. It is concluded that the technique of bladder drainage allows a 'normalization' of peripheral levels of insulin that is associated with amelioration of an altered glucose response after oral challenge. However the clamp studies show that, despite the improvement in insulin response, an insensitivity may exist to a wide range of endogenous levels after pancreas transplantation.\r"

One diet was enriched with N-3 fatty acids, whereas the other contained N-6 fatty acids, primarily linoleic acid. Animals fed N-6 fatty acids developed significant lactic acidemia, microvascular muscle hypoperfusion, and pulmonary infiltrates in response to endotoxin infusion. N-3 fatty acid-fed animals demonstrated improved lactate levels, microvascular muscle perfusion, and lung morphology compared to N-6 fatty acid-fed animals after endotoxin infusion. There was no significant change in cardiac output, PaO2, or mean arterial blood pressure at the end of the endotoxin infusion in either group. Pretreatment with indomethacin, or BM 13505, a specific thromboxane A2 receptor blocker, ameliorated the development of metabolic acidosis in N-6 fatty acid-fed animals, demonstrating a role for prostanoids in the sequelae of endotoxemia. The ability of dietary pretreatment with N-3 fatty acids to influence favorably the physiologic response to endotoxin represents a novel nutrient-metabolic interaction with potential therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "The modern era for splenic surgery for injury began in 1892 when Riegner reported a splenectomy in a 14-year-old construction worker who fell from a height and presented with abdominal pain, distension, tachycardia, and oliguria. This report set the stage for routine splenectomy, which was performed for all splenic injury in the next two generations. Despite early reports by Pearce and by Morris and Bullock that splenectomy in animals caused impaired defenses against infection, little challenge to routine splenectomy was made until King and Schumacker in 1952 reported a syndrome of \"overwhelming postsplenectomy infection\" (OPSI). Many studies have since demonstrated the importance of the spleen in preventing infections, particularly from the encapsulated organisms. Overwhelming postsplenectomy infection occurs in about 0.6% of children and 0.3% of adults. Intraoperative splenic salvage has become more popular and can be achieved safely in most patients by delivering the spleen with the pancreas to the incision, carefully repairing the spleen under direct vision, and using the many adjuncts to suture repair, including hemostatic agents and splenic wrapping. Intraoperative splenic salvage is not indicated in patients actively bleeding from other organs or in the presence of alcoholic cirrhosis. The role of splenic replantation in those patients requiring operative splenectomy needs further study but may provide significant long-term splenic function. Although nonoperative splenic salvage was first suggested more than 100 years ago by Billroth, this modality did not become popular in children until the 1960s or in adults until the latter 1980s. Patients with intrasplenic hematomas or with splenic fractures that do not extend to the hilum as judged by computed tomography usually can be observed successfully without operative intervention and without blood transfusion. Nonoperative splenic salvage is less likely with fractures that involve the splenic hilum and with the severely shattered spleen; these patients usually are treated best by early operative intervention. Following splenectomy for injury, polyvalent pneumococcal vaccine decreases the likelihood of OPSI and should be used routinely. The role of prophylactic penicillin is uncertain but the use of antibiotics for minor infectious problems is indicated after splenectomy.\r"

Intervention studies are about to begin that will assess various lipid-and lipoprotein-modifying therapies and their ability to reduce vascular disease risk in the elderly.\r"

There are at least 16 new drugs undergoing evaluation that may improve cognitive function. Some of these drugs are intended to augment acetylcholine neurotransmitter function. Others are nootropics that affect neuron metabolism with little effect elsewhere. A third major category is drugs that affect brain vasculature. A miscellaneous group includes drugs aimed at modifying other defects found in Alzheimer's disease. Drugs to affect behavior have been available for some time. These include neuroleptics, anxiolytics, and antirage drugs. Use of all these drugs has been controversial. Recent federal legislation and guidelines affect their use in nursing homes. Specific indications for neuroleptics are psychotic features and agitation. Dosage for patients with dementia is different than for other psychotic patients. There is no consensus on the use of other psychoactive medications.\r"

Verapamil, nifedipine, and diltiazem represent prototype compounds for unique chemical classes with differing pharmacologic properties. These drugs lower elevated blood pressure with efficacy comparable with other commonly used antihypertensives. Combination therapy with other agents usually results in an additive response. Side effects are usually mild and reversible and usually are an extension of the drug's pharmacologic effects. Moreover, adverse metabolic effects on lipid, glucose, or potassium levels are not common. Because of the excellent antihypertensive effects of calcium channel blockers and their potential importance in a variety of other disease states, these agents should be routinely considered for use as a first-line antihypertensive agent in appropriately selected patients with hypertension of any severity as part of a comprehensive plan to minimize cardiovascular risk.\r"

A small, but important, group of patients with alanine aminotransferase abnormality have underlying liver disease that may be treatable. Most can be diagnosed based on history, physical examination, and biochemical-serological profiles. Liver biopsy can complement the diagnostic process in selected circumstances.

Neonatal complications included nine premature deliveries, two cases of intrauterine growth retardation, and one of Treacher Collins syndrome. Obstetric complications included threatened abortion (two), placenta previa (two), and preeclampsia (three). Cesarean sections were necessary in five patients. There was no maternal or neonatal mortality. Thirteen episodes of systemic lupus erythematosus relapses were detected by incidents of increasing proteinuria (six), arthritis (four), and vasculitic rash (two). There were no statistical differences in changes in hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin level, antinuclear antibody titer, or C3 or C4 level between the patients who relapsed and those who did not. Pregnancy could induce a flare of systemic lupus erythematosus in previously normal patients or patients with previously inactive disease. The overall neonatal and maternal survival was good, even in patients who presented during pregnancy. Spontaneous fetal loss was low (2/29 [6.9%]); both cases occurred in mothers with inactive lupus.\r"

A questionnaire was administered to 75 ambulatory elderly persons by personal interview at community dining sites. Fifty-two percent (39) of these subjects said they were familiar with living wills and 64% (48 persons) correctly summarized what the North Carolina living will says. When asked about preferences for medical care in the setting of a terminal illness, 86% (65 persons) stated a desire to receive basic medical care or comfort care only. Although their preferences were consistent with the provisions of a living will, none had signed the living will document provided by the state of North Carolina, and only two (3%) had discussed a living will with their physician. Seventy (93%) wanted their family or spouse to make decisions about terminal care if they themselves were unable to participate, and discussions between these persons and their chosen proxies actually occurred 45% (34/75) of the time. Eighty-one percent (61 persons) stated a desire to discuss end-of-life care with their physicians, but a minority (eight [11%]) had actually talked with their physicians, and these discussions were usually initiated by the patient (five of eight). We conclude that living will legislation is congruent with the desire of many elderly persons to limit medical care in terminal illness. However, this elderly population did not make use of living wills as a means of indicating their wishes. Recommendations are made to improve physician-patient and patient-proxy communication regarding preferences for medical care at the end of life and living wills. Alternatives to the living will should also be explored.\r"

They had clear and consistent patterns of preferences regarding the utilization of life-sustaining treatment. Generally, participants opted not to be treated, although there was variability among participants. They were even less inclined to opt for treatment as their perceived level of future cognitive functioning declined, or when the life-sustaining treatment involved permanent rather than temporary procedures.\r"

Fifty patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (including 18 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia) and stable low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels greater than 3.90 mmol/L (greater than 150 mg/dL) (6.10 +/- 1.30 [SD] mmol/L; 236 +/- 50 mg/dL) while on a hypolipidemic diet were assigned to treatment for 12 weeks with either 9 g/d of filicol, a microporous cholestyramine analogue, or 1.2 g/d of gemfibrozil in a randomized clinical trial. Tolerance was good with both drugs. Filicol and gemfibrozil caused similar decrements of total cholesterol (14% for both), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (20% and 18%, respectively), and apolipoprotein B (16% and 21%, respectively). Close to 40% of the patients had decreases of greater than 25% in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with both drugs. Gemfibrozil, but not filicol, significantly increased plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (16%) and apolipoprotein A-I (17%) levels and reduced triglyceride levels (35%). No loss of efficacy was observed with either drug in subsets of patients who had a good 12-week response rate and had extended therapy for up to 12 months. This study demonstrates that gemfibrozil may have a beneficial effect on all aspects of the plasma lipid profile in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, a clinical situation where it can be used with potential advantages over standard doses of anion-exchange resins.\r"

Enlarged left atria and paired, age-matched normal left atria by echocardiography were selected. The carinal angle was measured on roentgenogram (standard and portable films) by goniometer. The left atrium could be accurately predicted to be larger than 5.0 cm in diameter if the carinal angle was 100 degrees or greater. A carinal angle greater than 100 degrees is an easy, inexpensive, reliable method of predicting left atrial enlargement.\r"

Thirty-five patients (greater than or equal to 13 years of age) with meningococcal infection, circulatory shock, and generalized purpuric lesions of abrupt onset were recorded in eight intensive care units from 1977 to 1989. The patients were young (mean age, 26.6 years; range, 13 to 68 years) and had been previously healthy. The female-to-male ratio was 3:1. Mortality was 54.3%, with most deaths occurring within the first 48 hours, usually secondary to irreversible shock with multiple organ failure. Ischemic complications (eight cases), prolonged heart failure (seven cases), and secondary septicemia (five cases) were the chief complications among survivors. Initial hemodynamic study after volume loading showed low stroke volume index (mean +/- SD, 29.4 +/- 13 mL/m2) and tachycardia (mean +/- SD, 138 +/- 16 beats per minute), a profile suggesting a greater myocardial depression than usually observed in gram-negative bacillary septic shock. Univariate prognostic analysis showed that four variables at the time of admission were associated with fatal outcome: a plasma fibrinogen level of 1.5 g/L or less, a factor V concentration of 0.20 or less, a platelet count lower than 80 x 10(9)/L, and a cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count of 20 x 10(6)/L or less. Stepwise regression analysis showed that low fibrinogen level (less than or equal to 1.5 g/L) was the sole adverse prognostic variable (odds ratio = 2, 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.7). Adult overwhelming meningococcal purpura is still associated with high mortality and morbidity. Low fibrinogen level at time of admission may permit early recognition of the most severely ill patients.\r"

The prevalences of known risk factors such as older age, male sex, duration of dialysis, presence of diabetes, coronary artery disease, or hypertension do not seem to have changed during this time. However, evidence suggests that an increased body aluminum level may have an adverse effect on survival even in the absence of overt aluminum toxic reaction. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation between serum aluminum levels and mortality in 10 646 patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. Mortalities were 18% higher for patients with serum aluminum levels between 1520 and 2220 nmol/L and progressively increased to 60% higher for patients with aluminum levels above 7410 nmol/L. Serum aluminum level was an important predictor of survival even after other known risk factors had been controlled. These data strongly suggest that patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis should have periodic surveillance of the serum aluminum levels, and in those patients who have plasma levels of 1520 to 2220 nmol/L or higher, one should seriously consider discontinuing aluminum salts and giving therapy to decrease body aluminum level if it is found to be increased.\r"

  ".W": "We determined whether the exercise electrocardiogram predicted acute cardiac events during moderate or strenuous physical activity among 3617 asymptomatic, hypercholesterolemic men (age range, 35 to 59 years) who were followed up in the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial. Submaximal exercise test results were obtained at entry and at annual follow-up visits in years 2 through 7. ST-segment depression or elevation (greater than or equal to 1 mm or 10 microV-sec) was considered to be a positive test result. The circumstances that surrounded each nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease death were determined through a record review. The cumulative incidence of activity-related acute cardiac events was 2% during a mean follow-up period of 7.4 years. The risk was increased 2.6-fold in the presence of clinically silent, exercise-induced, ST-segment changes at entry (95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.3 to 5.2) after adjustment for 11 other potential risk factors. Of 62 men who experienced an activity-related event, 11 had a positive test result at entry (sensitivity, 18%; 95% Cl, 8 to 27). The specificity of the entry exercise test was 92% (95% Cl, 91 to 93). The sensitivity and specificity were similar when the length of follow-up was restricted to 1 year after testing. For a newly positive test result on a follow-up visit, the sensitivity was 24% (95% Cl, 12 to 36), and the specificity was 85% (95% Cl, 84 to 86); for any positive test result during the study (mean number of tests per subject, 6.2), the sensitivity was 37% (95% Cl, 25 to 49), and the specificity was 79% (95% Cl, 77 to 80). Our findings suggested that the presence of clinically silent, exercise-induced, ischemic ST-segment changes on a submaximal test was associated with an increased risk of activity-related acute cardiac events. However, this test was not sensitive when used to predict the occurrence of activity-related events among asymptomatic, hypercholesterolemic men. For this reason, the utility of the submaximal exercise test to assess the safety of physical activity among asymptomatic men at risk of coronary heart disease is likely to be limited.\r"

Fifty consecutive patients with acute venous thromboembolism had their continuous intravenous heparin therapy adjusted according to this heparin nomogram. The effect of the nomogram on heparin therapy in these patients was compared with data from 53 historical control patients. The proportion of patients in the nomogram group who reached a therapeutic APTT at 24 hours after the start of heparin therapy was 66%, which increased to 81% at 48 hours. In contrast, 37% and 58% of the control patients reached a therapeutic APTT at 24 and 48 hours, respectively. The percentage of therapeutic APTT results of the total number of APTT determinations was greater in the nomogram patients than controls. The use of this heparin nomogram resulted in (1) achieving a therapeutic APTT at 24 and 48 hours in a large proportion of patients and (2) reduced periods of inadequate anticoagulation and overanticoagulation during heparin therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term consequences of criminal victimization on physical health were examined among 390 adult women (74 nonvictims and 316 victims of crime). Data included health status self-ratings and objective service utilization. Findings indicated that severely victimized women, compared with nonvictims, reported more distress and less well-being, made physician visits twice as frequently in the index year, and had outpatient costs that were 2.5 times greater. Criminal victimization severity was the most powerful predictor of physician visits and outpatient costs. Utilization data across 5 years preceding and following crime were obtained from 15 rape victims, 26 physical assault victims, and 27 noncontact crime victims and were compared with five continuous years of utilization among 26 nonvictims. Victims' physician visits increased 15% to 24% during the year of the crime compared with less than 2% change among nonvictims. We conclude that these long-term deleterious effects suggest that criminally victimized women's needs for medical treatment transcend the traditional focus on emergency care and forensic evaluation.\r"

Moreover, exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia has been considered to confer a poor prognosis although this has not been specifically studied. On a retrospective review of 3351 patients who had undergone routine clinical exercise testing between September 1984 and June 1989, we identified 55 patients with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 2 to 58 months). Fifty patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing and one of these patients died due to congestive heart failure during the follow-up period. Five patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing and one died suddenly 7 months after the test. Ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in only two of the 29 patients who underwent repeated exercise testing. Ventricular tachycardia during routine clinical exercise testing occurred rarely (prevalence of 1.5%) and was not associated with complications during testing. The total mortality in the exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia group (3.6%) was not significantly different from the mortality in the entire population (5.1%). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurring during clinical exercise testing is not an independent marker of a poor prognosis.\r"

Group 1, comprising 21 psoriatic patients, was treated with 14 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 4 weeks in a prospective, placebo-controlled study; group 2, comprising 28 patients with diverse cutaneous diseases, was given 6 mg/kg per day of oral cyclosporine for 1 to 3 months in a prospective, open-labeled study. Renal function (determined by serum urea nitrogen [SUN] and creatinine levels and urinalysis), BP, serum electrolyte levels (potassium and magnesium), and urate level were measured weekly for the first 4 weeks in both groups, and then, after 2 and 3 months of therapy, in group 2 only. During the first 4 weeks in group 1 patients, there were significant increases in values of SUN, creatinine, BP, potassium, and urate, and a significant decrease in the serum magnesium value. When data for the two groups were combined, the changes from pretherapy values in each of the above measures (except systolic BP) during the first 4 weeks correlated significantly with cyclosporine trough levels. In group 2, the changes that occurred in the first 4 weeks in the SUN value, SUN/creatinine ratio, and BP were magnified over the subsequent 8 weeks of treatment. In the combined group for the first 4 weeks of therapy, duration of therapy, independent of cyclosporine trough levels, correlated with changes in SUN, creatinine, and urate levels, but not with changes in the potassium or magnesium level or in BP. We conclude that the cyclosporine blood level was a better discriminant than cyclosporine dosage in the analysis of renal dysfunction and hypertension in these patients.\r"

Functional limitations included depending on others for transportation (33%) and mental incompetence or poor recent memory (42%). The percentage of patients with functional limitation increased sharply with increasing age. In a substantial number of patients there was also evidence for poor social support networks; 26.5% of subjects lived alone and 38.9% had no children living in the vicinity. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, the predictors of having a poor social support network included non-Hispanic white ethnicity, advanced age, low income, and being a recent migrant to the area. Subjects with functional limitations were more likely to have poor social support networks than subjects without such limitations. The deleterious combination of impaired functional status and a limited social support network may explain why elderly cancer patients are at increased risk for not receiving appropriate therapy. Given the potential complexities involving the evaluation and appropriate treatment of cancer, care must be taken to adequately assess functional status and support mechanisms of older patients, and to provide adequate support to ensure compliance with treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Among the most venerable concepts in dermatopathology is Unna's 19th century notion of Abtropfung, ie, that melanocytes drop off from the epidermis to the dermis during the histogenesis of melanocytic tumors. Paradoxically, however, Unna's basic premise of an epidermal origin for melanocytes has been seriously questioned for over 40 years, based on experimental evidence favoring a neural crest origin for melanocytes. Recent work has strengthened the evidence for a neural crest origin of epidermal melanocytes, and it has been suggested that the concept of Abtropfung be replaced by the concept of Hochsteigerung. The concept of Hochsteigerung holds that melanocytes migrate up from the dermis into the epidermis-not only in normal development, but also during normal tissue maintenance. It now seems likely that the precursor of melanocytes, in both normal and abnormal differentiation, may not be a melanoblast (a primitive cell committed to melanocytic differentiation) but rather a pluripotential cell. Although axon-investing Schwann cells have been the traditional focus as the closest relative of the epidermal melanocyte, recent studies suggest that another nerve sheath cell, the perineural cell, might be a better candidate. These concepts have profound implications for the histogenesis of melanocytic nevi and melanomas.\r"

The differential diagnosis of recurrent pigmented melanocytic nevi is discussed, with particular emphasis on distinguishing these lesions from malignant melanoma. Our immunohistochemical observations indicate that the recurrences most likely develop as a result of proliferation of melanocytes remaining in the epidermis and/or adnexae following incomplete removal.

Fifteen sections of predetermined lung areas were obtained and examined. Tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries was detected in 12 cases (10.7%), with simultaneous involvement of other vascular territories in 11. Seven patients had dyspnea; four, right ventricular failure; four, hypertrophy of the right ventricle; and three, arterial vascular sclerosis. The present data have led us to conclude that pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries occurs in association with the involvement of arterial or lymphatic vessels and should be analyzed within the context of the study of subacute cor pulmonale.\r"

The epithelial lining of the cysts was usually flat or cuboidal to low columnar, and mucin pools frequently appeared near the ruptured cysts. Three mucocelelike tumors contained a microscopic focus of mucinous carcinoma. The other tumors had areas of atypical ductal hyperplasia containing abundant intraluminal mucinous materials. The mucin was composed predominantly of neutral and nonsulfated acid mucins whose character was identical to that of those in mucinous carcinoma. Because all mucocelelike tumors in our series were associated with either atypical ductal hyperplasia or carcinoma and because some mucocelelike tumors may indeed be early mucinous carcinomas of the breast, we recommend examination of the entire specimen and careful clinical follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "Most studies of secretory carcinoma of the breast have been single case reports or separate analyses of the problem in either children or adults. We studied 10 female patients, aged 5 to 87 years. Most patients presented with a palpable mass, often near the areola. Five of six tumors were estrogen receptor negative; three analyzed for progesterone receptor were positive. Histologic patterns present in varying proportions were \"classic\" secretory carcinoma with microacini, abundant secretion with papillary features, and with prominent solid and papillary apocrine features. The tumors had strong reactivity for alpha-lactalbumin, S100, and carcinoembryonic antigen (polyclonal) and were negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (monoclonal). Six patients had mastectomy; four had local excision; none had axillary nodal metastases initially. With follow-up of 3 to 72 months (mean, 47 months; median, 48 months), two patients treated by local excision had local recurrences, one patient had axillary nodal metastases. All patients are alive. Comparison of patients under and over 30 years of age revealed one important difference: younger patients had a longer interval between detection and biopsy-30 vs 2 months. Treatment recommendations are initial wide excision or quadrantectomy with low axillary dissection in most cases and, in premenarchal patients, strong effort to preserve the breast bud without jeopardizing local control.\r"

Based on her initial clinical presentation and results of a chemical evaluation, she was originally thought to have non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but her condition did not respond to corticosteroid therapy. Further evaluation confirmed the presence of an ovarian neoplasm. The excised ovary contained an attached gray-brown mass. Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination revealed the mass to be a steroid cell tumor. Because Reinke's crystals were not present, it was designated to be a steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified. This case represents one of 22 reported cases of steroid cell tumor occurring in children described in the literature, most of which have been associated with heterosexual precocity. To our knowledge, steroid cell tumors are benign when they occur in prepubertal children. Although they are rare, steroid cell tumors of the ovary should be considered in cases of childhood virilization.\r"

The cause is postulated to be an IgM autoantibody directed against components of the granulocyte membranes. Spurious leukopenia is encountered infrequently with automated hematology analyzers. Cold-induced granulocyte agglutination should be recognized as a potential cause of pseudogranulocytopenia so that white blood cell counts can be accurately reported and unnecessary evaluation of patients for leukopenia can be avoided.\r"

  ".U": "91128110\r", 
  ".W": "Gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) is a 15-kd glycoprotein that is expressed by normal apocrine epithelia and in a majority of breast carcinomas. However, recent studies have demonstrated that this substance is also present in tumors of the salivary glands, sweat glands, and prostate gland. To determine whether the expression of CGDFP-15 might aid in the differential diagnosis of salivary gland lesions, the anti-GCDFP-15 monoclonal antibody D6 was applied to paraffin sections of 133 such neoplasms. Benign tumors (76% reactive) were more often labeled than malignant lesions (28% reactive) by this antibody; overall, 53 (41%) of 133 cases were positive for GCDFP-15. Notably, the tubuloglandular components in 17 (81%) of 21 pleomorphic adenomas were reactive, but no example of either adenoid cystic carcinoma or polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma were labeled. In contrast, 24% of adenocarcinomas stained with this antibody. The apparent expression of GCDFP-15 by a spectrum of salivary gland tumors supports their biologic relationship to lesions of the cutaneous apocrine glands and breast. Furthermore, the demonstration of this determinant may be of use in suggesting the salivary gland nature of poorly differentiated carcinomas of the head and neck, and it may facilitate the separation of pleomorphic adenoma from histologically similar malignant neoplasms in the salivary glands themselves.\r"

Patients with circulating antimurine immunoglobulin antibodies capable of interfering in these assays have been encountered and described sporadically. Parenteral administration of murine monoclonal antibodies for imaging and therapeutic purposes is increasing and is known to induce human anti-murine antibodies frequently. We examined 60 serum samples from 48 individuals who received such murine immunoglobulin to determine whether iatrogenically induced anti-murine antibodies could interfere in a two-site (sandwich) immunoradiometric assay for serum thyrotropin. We found that these circulating antibodies can indeed interfere in an \"unblocked\" assay, but that the interference appears to be suppressed by including nonspecific IgG in the commercial version of the assay kit.\r"

Accordingly, the DNA content and morphometric features of the neoplastic cells of the tall cell variant were measured and compared with measurements obtained from neoplastic cells of the usual form of papillary carcinoma. Six of the 11 tall cell neoplasms were aneuploid, as were four of the eight usual papillary neoplasms. Although benign cells were separated from malignant cells in each case, differences between tall and usual papillary carcinoma cells were not observed regarding DNA content, chromatin texture, or nuclear size and shape. Differences in the clinical behavior of these neoplasms will likely need to be explained on the basis of other characteristics.\r"

Cytogenetic analysis of the in situ cancer and the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed a 46,XX karyotype. In addition, the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed homozygous chromosomal heteromorphisms, compared with heterozygous markers found in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

The mean percent of ring neutrophils was 9.5% (range, 1.0% to 28.0%) in patients with multiple myeloma, which was significantly greater than in those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or in healthy controls. In multiple myeloma, the incidence of ring neutrophils in the pretreatment phase was greater than that in the remission phase. A great deal of overlap was noted between multiple myeloma in the remission phase and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The incidence of ring neutrophils seemed to vary according to disease stage. Ring neutrophils may reflect abnormal granulopoiesis in plasma cell dyscrasias.\r"

The ranges established with standard and rapid lysis were similar when antibodies directed to the same cluster designation were used. Although slight statistical differences in relative percentages of CD2 and CD3 lymphocytes were observed, these differences were probably not clinically significant.

After 7 days, the rats were weighed and bled, and one kidney was assayed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D1 hydroxylase activity. Several manifestations of pancreatitis were observed in rats given the diet: weight loss (from 29.6 to 26.3 g vs that for control rats, from 29 to 52.8 g) and lower dietary intake (15.5 vs 47 g per rat per 7 days). Serum amylase levels fell from 1794 to 350 U/L in rats given the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet compared with levels of 1800 to 2100 U/L in control rats. The pancreases of rats given the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet showed degeneration, necrosis, and hemorrhaging. Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, chloride, and parathyroid hormone did not change significantly throughout the experiment. Renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D1 hydroxylase activity was higher than in control rats (8.9 +/- 0.8 vs 7.6 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg of kidney per minute). Acute pancreatitis in this experimental animal model does not alter serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone or reduce target organ responsiveness to the hormone.\r"

The response to tetanus toxoid vaccination on admission of patients surviving trauma for over 2 weeks was defined as the ratio of day 14 to day 0 serum IgG antitetanus toxoid levels. Antitetanus toxoid responses were normal after both blunt and penetrating trauma. When stratified according to delayed type hypersensitivity responses, patients with trauma showed better antibody responses than patients without trauma. Major infection rates were similar between trauma groups (three of 24 with blunt trauma vs two of seven with penetrating trauma) and independent of delayed type hypersensitivity (two of 20 reactive patients vs three of 11 anergic patients), in contrast to patients without trauma (one of 19 reactive patients vs 15 of 36 anergic patients). We conclude that decreased delayed type hypersensitivity after moderate trauma is temporary, and that this transient immunodeficiency is not as strongly associated with reduced antibody responses and increased risk of infection as anergy in surgical patients without trauma.\r"

Fungal infections were successfully treated with amphotericin B in 63 cases (74.1%) but were associated with diminished patient survival (50% vs 83.5%).

Mesenteric lymph nodes showed parallel incidences of translocation. The peritoneal cavity became contaminated only if the biomaterial itself became contaminated. No bacterial overgrowth, perforation, or histologic changes in the bowel were found. Subcutaneous biomaterials remained sterile. Ingested fluorescent beads appeared in enterocytes, in lamina propria within macrophages, and in intraperitoneal biomaterials. The data suggest that intraperitoneal sterile reactive stimuli can induce bacterial translocation to the dense prosthesis directly through the intact normal bowel wall. One of the mechanisms seems to involve phagocytosis of particles and bacteria within the bowel wall that are then chemotactically attracted to nearby sites of inflammation.\r"

Although generally well treated, the effect of these transient antigen exposures on the immune system is unclear. We have previously shown that prior intraperitoneal inoculation with live bacteria leads to increased numbers of intraperitoneal abscesses. Data presented here demonstrate in a murine model that two immunizations with live Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, or both, administered systemically via intracardiac injection or at a focal distant site in subcutaneous tissue, significantly increased the number of mixed E coli/B fragilis intraperitoneal abscesses when induced 1 week later. Further, immunization with E coli, either alone or in combination with B fragilis, increased the total number of anaerobes recovered per mouse. Transient or focal sublethal infections can significantly alter an animal's immune response to later infectious insults, particularly the formation of intraperitoneal abscesses.\r"

  ".W": "Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is associated with a significant mortality, 66% in a previous retrospective study of NP complicating intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). We prospectively compared the outcome of NP complicating IAS with that of recurrent IAS (R-IAS) in the absence of NP. Data were collected prospectively on 300 patients with IAS; 34 patients who presented with pneumonia were excluded from the analysis (44% mortality). One hundred seventy-one patients with no NP and no R-IAS (group 1) had a hospital mortality of 20% (34 patients); 36 without NP in whom R-IAS developed (group 2) had a 17% mortality (six patients); and 47 with NP but no R-IAS (group 3) had a 53% mortality (25 patients). Finally, 12 patients who had both NP and R-IAS suffered a 75% mortality (nine patients). We examined the relationships among the following putative risk factors and mortality: APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score (at initial presentation with IAS), the need for mechanical ventilatory assistance following initial treatment for peritonitis, steroid requirement, generalized peritonitis vs abscess, and the need for surgical as opposed to percutaneous treatment. Using mortality as the dependent variable, group 2 vs 3 as the explanatory variable, and the risk factors as confounders, logistic regression analysis indicated that the group difference was significant after controlling for confounders. We conclude that NP complicating IAS is an independent risk factor associated with a significant mortality compared with R-IAS. These data challenge the notion that death in IAS is usually due to recurrent or persistent intra-abdominal infection.\r"

  ".W": "Increased mortality from sepsis is associated with high levels of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha). Linoleic acid, an n-6 essential fatty acid, is the usual precursor of TXB2 and PGF1 alpha, while fish oil is rich in n-3 essential fatty acid, the precursor of less active moieties. Rats were fed chow, an essential fatty acid-deficient diet, or an essential fatty acid-deficient diet supplemented with linoleic acid or fish oil for 2 weeks. The animals then underwent a sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture to induce sepsis. Six hours later, blood was obtained for analysis. The chow and linoleic acid diets produced significant (twofold to fivefold) increases in levels of both TXB2 and PGF1 alpha after sepsis. The essential fatty acid-deficient diet and fish oil diet protected against increases in levels of TXB2 or PGF1 alpha during sepsis. Dietary restriction of linoleic acid or fish oil supplementation may play an important role in altering the inflammatory mediator response to sepsis.\r"

Gastrointestinal permeability was assessed before burn and on postburn days 1 through 3, 7, and 14 by administering 5 mL of an isotonic mixture of 8% lactulose and 1.15% L-rhamnose by gavage and measuring the urinary excretion for the next 7 hours. In normal guinea pigs, lactulose (molecular weight, 342d) is mostly absorbed by the paracellular route, whereas L-rhamnose (molecular weight, 164 d) is mostly absorbed by the transcellular route. Gut permeability to L-rhamnose did not increase after burn injury (211 micrograms before burn vs 230, 260, 180, 238, and 221 micrograms on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14, respectively, after burn). By contrast, gut permeability to lactulose increased significantly and was greatest in the first 48 hours after burn injury (60 micrograms before burn vs 380, 354, 203, 364, and 279 micrograms on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14, respectively, after burn). Gut permeability to low-molecular-weight compounds increases immediately after burn trauma, and this may be by a paracellular rather than transcellular mechanism.\r"

In particular, cytomegalovirus infection has been associated with a significant detrimental effect on patient and allograft survival after solid-organ transplantation. We are evaluating a new antiviral agent, ganciclovir 9-[1,3-dihydroxy-2-2 propoxymethyl] guanine (DHPG), used in solid-organ transplant recipients who developed life-threatening cytomegalovirus infections. Between March 1, 1987, and June 30, 1989, we treated 93 solid-organ transplant patients who developed tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus disease. From this group of patients we have identified 14 patients with primary gastrointestinal cytomegalovirus disease who received treatment with DHPG. Tissue diagnosis was made by endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract (11 patients) or colonoscopy (three patients). Invasive cytomegalovirus disease was identified prior to severe complications of the gastrointestinal tract in all but one patient, who suffered colonic perforation prior to treatment with DHPG and subsequently died of bacterial sepsis. While 13 of the 14 patients improved after treatment with DHPG, four patients required additional treatments for recurrent cytomegalovirus disease and recovered. No DHPG toxicity was observed. We believe treatment with DHPG is indicated in this patient population, but that further studies are indicated to fully define the impact of this recommendation on both patient and allograft survival after solid-organ transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Although active hepatocellular function is depressed during sepsis, it is not known whether this occurs in the very early stages of sepsis and whether it is due to depressed cardiac output or hepatic blood flow. To study this, rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture and hepatocellular function was determined at various intervals thereafter by assessing the ability of the liver to clear different doses of indocyanine green. The indocyanine green concentration was continuously measured in vivo with a fiberoptic catheter and an in vivo hemoreflectometer. Maximal velocity and kinetic constant of the clearance of indocyanine green, hepatic blood flow, and cardiac output were determined in experimental and sham-operated rats. The results demonstrate that hepatic blood flow and cardiac output increased 2 to 10 hours after cecal ligation and puncture, while hepatocellular function (maximum velocity and kinetic constant) was decreased even 2 hours following cecal ligation and puncture. No linear correlation between hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow or cardiac output was found under such conditions. The extremely early depression in active hepatocellular function, despite the increased hepatic blood flow and cardiac output, may form the basis for cellular dysfunctions leading to multiple organ failure during sepsis.\r"

Leukocytes were isolated and analyzed by the following three variables: surface and total cellular Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), superoxide anion expression, and lactoferrin release. Leukocytes from the unfavorable, poorly oxygenated wound environment activate on entry into the wound. Leukocytes from the musculocutaneous flap wound are better able to respond to a maximal challenge with the phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate. These findings may account for the enhanced bactericidal actions of the musculocutaneous flap compared with the random-pattern flap observed clinically.\r"

The two groups were similar in age, initial sepsis scores, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score. A significantly lower mortality was recorded in the IgG-treated group (38%) than in controls (67%). Septic shock was the cause of death in 7% of IgG-treated patients and in 33% of controls. The results of this study indicate that high-dose IgG improves survival and decreases death from septic shock in surgical patients with a sepsis score of 20 or greater.\r"

Twenty-one of the 36 cases that developed among patients admitted to the surgical services occurred on two adjacent general surgery wards that shared attending surgeons and house staff. Perioperative prophylactic antibiotics predated C difficile-associated disease in 20 patients, 12 of whom had short courses (less than 24 hours). Symptoms were typically nonspecific and early diagnosis may be difficult. Incidence remained high, despite infection control measures, until the coincidental closure of two surgical wards. Clostridium difficile-associated disease is a nosocomial infection that can be associated with short courses of prophylactic antibiotics. Recommendations regarding the use of perioperative prophylaxis should recognize C difficile-associated disease as a significant potential complication.\r"

Macrophage production of interleukin 1 and antigen presentation were studied in these two strains of mice following cecal ligation and puncture at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days. Splenic macrophages were cultured with a T-helper cell clone (D10.G4.1), and antigen presentation and interleukin 1 production were measured by D10.G4.1 proliferation. Macrophage antigen presentation by C2H/HeJ mice was markedly increased compared with that in C3H/HeN mice at all times after cecal ligation and puncture, most strikingly at 2 days (185m740 cpm for C3H/HeJ mice vs 30,300 for C2H/HeN mice). Macrophage interleukin 1 production was significantly increased in C3H/HeJ mice vs C3H/HeN mice at all times after cecal ligation and puncture (except at 2 days) and was maximal at 8 days (25,000 cpm for C3H/HeJ mice vs 5190 for C3H/HeN mice). These data suggest that the differences in mortality after cecal ligation and puncture between these two strains of mice may relate to a supranormal response of macrophages of C3H/HeJ mice or to an inadequate response of macrophages of C3H/HeN mice.\r"

Although behavioral performance (button-press accuracy, reaction time, and running counts) was comparable across all groups (although accuracy was worse for those in the left temporal group), patients showed tremendous variability in both the amplitude and latency of the P300 response. Particularly notable was the observation that more slow wave activity was present among the patients than among the control subjects, and those scheduled for a left temporal resection evinced more amplitude reduction than those scheduled for a right temporal resection. In addition, a number of patients appeared not to show a P300 response at all. These results are discussed in the context of the utility of using noninvasive event-related potential measures to examine both memory impairment and the integrity of the neural structures that mediate memory functioning in certain patient populations.\r"

High-resolution single photon emission computed tomographic scanning was performed 21 hours after the intravenous administration of approximately 5 mCi of IQNB. In normal subjects, the images of retained ligand showed a consistent regional pattern that correlated with postmortem studies of the relative distribution of muscarinic receptors in the normal human brain, having high radioactivity counts in the basal ganglia, occipital cortex, and insular cortex, low counts in the thalamus, and virtually no counts in the cerebellum. Eight of 12 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had obvious focal cortical defects in either frontal or posterior temporal cortex. Both patients with a clinical diagnosis of Pick's disease had obvious frontal and anterior temporal defects. A region of interest statistical analysis of relative regional activity revealed a significant reduction bilaterally in the posterior temporal cortex of the patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. This study demonstrates the practicability of acetylcholine receptor imaging with 123IQNB and single photon emission computed tomography. The data suggest that focal abnormalities in muscarinic binding in vivo may characterize some patients with Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease, but further studies are needed to address questions about partial volume artifacts and receptor quantification.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate functional effects of various thalamic structures on metabolism in remote, morphologically intact cerebral regions, we used positron emission tomography of (18F)-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to study regional cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (rCMRGlu) in 11 patients with chronic unilateral or bilateral infarcts strictly confined to the thalamus. Patients were grouped according to computed tomographic scans showing anterior (three), medial (four), or posterior (four) lesions. Compared with a matched group of 11 healthy subjects (hemispheric CMRGlu 35.2 +/- 3.49 mumol/100 g per minute), glucose metabolism was significantly lower in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the infarction (31.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute). Patients with bilateral infarcts had lower hemispheric CMRGlu (29.9 +/- 2.74 mumol/100 g per minute) than those with unilateral lesions (32.2 +/- 2.97 mumol/100 g per minute). Depending on infarct location within the thalamus, there was differential depression of rCMRGlu, with the largest effects on frontal and occipital areas in medial infarctions. Except for ipsilateral thalamic deactivation, metabolic patterns with anterior thalamic infarcts were close to normal, while posterior infarcts mostly depressed rCMRGlu in the visual and in the inferior limbic cortex. Cerebellar metabolic rates were within normal limits in most cases. These patterns of regional cerebral deactivation may be related to categories of thalamic projections--intrathalamic, to limbic system and basal ganglia, diffuse to most cortical areas, and specific to defined neocortical areas. Even small brain lesions may have widespread functional sequelae, potentially demonstrable by positron emission tomography.\r"

The high-frequency power, low-frequency power, and total power of the heart rate power spectrum measured in the supine position--possible measures of parasympathetic nervous system function--were significant predictors of the expiratory-inspiratory ratio, the beat-to-beat heart rate difference on deep respiration, the standard deviation of the resting heart rate, the 30:15 ratio, and the Valsalva ratio. The change in low-frequency power on moving from the supine to upright position, a possible measure of sympathetic nervous system function, was a modest predictor of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure fall in response to postural change, but a poor predictor of the blood pressure response to isometric exercise and a cold stimulus. This study supports the role of heart rate power spectral analysis as a clinical test of autonomic function in patients with known or suspected autonomic failure.\r"

  ".W": "Three hundred twelve patients were entered into a long-term study of effects of hyperbaric oxygen on multiple sclerosis. The protocol called for an initial 20 treatments in either the monoplace or multiplace chamber on a daily basis followed by monthly booster treatments for 2 years. One hundred seventy neurologists and 22 institutions provided data for this study. There was no control group, but the study was based on Schumacher's postulation that a scientifically valid study to test the efficacy of a new therapy was possible by choosing patients who were definitively diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and following them up for 2 years after the imposed treatment. If the overwhelming majority of the subjects failed to get worse over the 2-year observation period, the efficacy of the treatment would be manifest. The expanded Kurtzke Disability Status Scale (EDSS) was used to assess the severity of the disease state. The dropout rate was high with only 76% (237 of 312 patients) finishing the initial 20 treatments. Twenty-two percent (69 of 312) finished 1 year of booster therapy, and 9% (28 of 312) completed 2 years of monthly boosters. The mean deterioration on the Kurtzke EDSS score was 0.93 or almost a full step from the beginning of treatment until the last evaluation. There was no difference in outcome between those who had the shortest and longest periods of time between onset of symptoms and hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Treatment pressure made no difference in outcome. Changes in the Kurtzke EDSS score bore no relationship to the use of booster treatment. Patients who were reasonably well off at the onset of treatment with initial Kurtzke EDSS scores of 1 or 2 (n = 21) deteriorated by an average of 1.7 Kurtzke points. Those patients whose initial Kurtzke EDSS scores were greater than 2 (n = 164) deteriorated on an average of 0.82 points. Of interest was that 19.5% (39 of 200) of the patients reported a temporary improvement in bladder function, but improvement was maintained in only 11 patients (5.5%) at 2-year follow-up. Fifteen patients (7.5%) indicated long-term worsening. There was no significant change in the working status of the patients following hyperbaric oxygen treatment. Although this study treated the patients in accordance with protocols reported to produce a benefit in multiple sclerosis, we were unable to substantiate any useful long-term effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.\r"

We used in vivo phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy to noninvasively assess brain energy and phospholipid metabolism by measuring brain concentrations of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and inorganic phosphate (Pi), as well as phospholipid compounds and intracellular pH. In study 1, 17 HIV-seropositive men with varying degrees of neuropsychiatric impairment and six control subjects were studied. Localized spectra were obtained from a heterogeneous 5 x 5 x 5-cm volume of interest (VOI). Patients with HIV infection had a significantly lower ATP/Pi ratio and a trend for a lower PCr/Pi ratio than did the control group. In addition, the ATP/Pi and PCr/Pi ratios were both significantly negatively correlated with overall severity of neuropsychiatric impairment. In study 2, three HIV-seropositive men with neuropsychiatric impairment were compared with 11 HIV-seronegative men. Localized phosphorus 31 magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from two relatively homogeneous VOIs: (1) a predominantly white matter VOI, and (2) a predominantly subcortical gray matter VOI. The three HIV-infected patients demonstrated significantly decreased ATP and PCr concentrations in the white matter VOI. These results suggest that HIV infection of the brain may impair brain cellular oxidative metabolism and that the degree of metabolic compromise may be related to the severity of neuropsychiatric impairment.\r"

Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal \"semipurposeful\" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway.\r"

Significantly associated with improvement were disease duration of less than 1 year, progression of weakness until treatment, absence of discrepancy in weakness between arms and legs, areflexia of the arms, and slowed nerve conduction velocity of the motor median nerve.

Worsening with action was not present; nor was there improvement with support as seen with idiopathic torticollis. Onset of pain immediately after the trauma and marked spasms of the paracervical muscles were other predominant features. Anticholinergic therapy was without benefit; however, some improvement occurred with botulinum toxin injection. It is concluded that torticollis can be caused by peripheral trauma and that it has unique clinical characteristics.\r"

A higher proportion of patients with Alzheimer's disease had detectable nerve fiber damage as seen by red-free photography compared with controls. Although the pallor area-to-disc area ratio was not significantly different between patients with Alzheimer's disease and controls, the patients with higher pallor area-to-disc area ratios had higher Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS) scores and longer durations of disease. Patients had an increased cup-to-disc ratio and cup volume and decreased disc rim area compared with controls. These variables also correlated significantly with ADAS scores and the duration of disease. The correlation among the optic nerve head changes and the ADAS scores in patients with Alzheimer's disease suggests a potential role for optic nerve head analysis in monitoring the progression of Alzheimer's disease and in assessing the effectiveness of any treatments developed.\r"

Three other characteristics were also associated with the risk of falls: use of miotic eye medications (OR, 3.2; 95% Cl, 1.0 to 10.1); visual field impairment of 40% or greater (OR, 3.0; 95% Cl, 0.94 to 9.8); and use of sedatives (OR, 2.4; 95% Cl, 0.89 to 6.7). These findings suggest that ocular and systemic medications are the major predictors of falls even in this elderly population seeking ophthalmologic care for glaucoma. Medications appear to pose a greater risk for falls than even major visual impairment.\r"

  ".W": "The Foveal Photocoagulation Study, a component of the Macular Photocoagulation Study, is designed to evaluate whether laser treatment can reduce the risk of severe visual loss in eyes with well-defined choroidal neovascular membranes associated with macular degeneration that extend through the foveal center. On one third of the 554 baseline angiograms of study patients enrolled in and whose eyes were graded in the study as of January 31, 1990, the Reading Center staff has noted an unusual pattern of hyperfluorescence in the late-transit frames that has not been described previously. This pattern, which we call \"loculated fluid,\" consists of a well-demarcated area of hyperfluorescence that appears to represent pooling of fluorescein in a compartmentalized space anterior to the choroidal neovascular leakage. Although the loculated fluid may conform to a pattern of typical cystoid macular edema, it can also pool within an area deep to the sensory retina in a shape that does not bear any resemblance to cystoid macular edema. This pattern is important to recognize because it (1) should not be confused with the angiographic pattern or extent of choroidal neovascularization and (2) should be differentiated from a serous detachment or tear of the retinal pigment epithelium.\r"

The head positions and eye movements of 16 patients were monitored while they adopted a variety of gaze positions. Five patients displayed a single head posture and four displayed multiple head postures. Six of the nine head postures matched the minimum intensity zone. The extent of the head posture was also found to be dictated by the velocity distribution of the slow phase, the nystagmus beat direction, and the neutral zone. Our results suggest that the surgical management of a head posture should not always be based only on the relocation of the minimum intensity zone to the primary gaze position.\r"

We used a camera and flash electrically coupled to an American Optical Non-Contact II tonometer (Cambridge Instruments Inc, Cambridge, Mass) or a Keeler Pulsair tonometer (Keeler Instruments Inc, Broomall, Pa) to photograph the corneal profile during tonometry. Most eyes revealed some degree of tear film dehiscence and microaerosol formation. While tears have not been implicated as a source of human immunodeficiency virus infection, the ease with which droplets, potentially contaminated with human immunodeficiency virus and other viruses, are dispersed is disturbing. \"Air-puff\" tonometry may not be aseptic as previously presumed.\r"

Follow-up assessments included flash and pattern visual evoked potentials, visual evoked potential threshold measurements, and clinical eye examinations. Nineteen children had normal visual function, three were visually impaired, and three remained blind. A strong association was found between normal, abnormal, or absent visual evoked potentials in the early postnatal period and long-term visual outcome (P less than .0001). Other perinatal indicators of asphyxia, including neurologic status, Apgar scores, and arterial pH values, were poor predictors of visual outcome.

The 1380 participants were ophthalmology outpatients, aged 40 to 79 years, classified into the following groups: posterior subcapsular only, 72 patients; nuclear only, 137 patients; cortical only, 290 patients; mixed cataract, 446 patients; and controls, 435 patients. In polychotomous logistic regression analyses, low education increased risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.46) and regular use of multivitamin supplements decreased risk (OR = 0.63) for all cataract types. Dietary intake of riboflavin, vitamins C, E, and carotene, which have antioxidant potential, was protective for cortical, nuclear, and mixed cataract; intake of niacin, thiamine, and iron also decreased risk. Similar results were found in analyses that combined the antioxidant vitamins (OR = 0.40) or considered the individual nutrients (OR = 0.48 to 0.56). Diabetes increased risk of posterior subcapsular, cortical, and mixed cataracts (OR = 1.56). Oral steroid therapy increased posterior subcapsular cataract risk (OR = 5.83). Females (OR = 1.51) and nonwhites (OR = 2.03) were at increased risk only for cortical cataract. Risk factors for nuclear cataract were a nonprofessional occupation (OR = 1.96), current smoking (OR = 1.68), body mass index (OR = 0.76), and occupational exposure to sunlight (OR = 0.61). Gout medications (OR = 2.48), family history (OR = 1.52), and use of eyeglasses by age 20 years, which is an indicator of myopia (OR = 1.44), increased risk of mixed cataract. The results support a role for the nutritional, medical, personal, and other factors in cataractogenesis. The potentially modifiable factors suggested by this study merit further evaluation.\r"

The Physicians' Health Study, a randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial among 22,071 male physicians, aged 40 to 84 years, provided the opportunity to collect information about whether low-dose aspirin therapy (325 mg on alternate days) affects the development or extraction of cataract. There were 173 age-related cataracts among those physicians assigned to aspirin therapy and 180 among those given placebo (relative risk, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.22). Cataract extractions were less frequent in the aspirin than in the placebo group, but this difference was not statistically significant (relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.56 to 1.15). Among younger men (aged 40 to 59 years), the relative risks were 0.62 (95% confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.94) for cataract development and 0.67 (95% confidence interval, 0.38 to 1.31) for cataract extraction. These randomized trial data tend to exclude any large benefit of aspirin. While the overall findings concerning cataract development seem to be null, the data on extraction of age-related cataract, while not statistically significant, cannot exclude a possible small to moderate benefit of alternate-day aspirin therapy on the extraction of age-related cataract.\r"

The use of either antipsychotic or other phenothiazine drugs increased the risk of cataract extraction by roughly 3.5 times in individuals who were both current users and were exposed some time in the 2 to 5 years prior to their extraction. Risk was also increased in individuals with prior use of antidiabetic agents, systemic steroids, and benzodiazepines. Contrary to some prior reports, there was no elevated risk associated with use of antihypertensives, and there was no protective effect for aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen.\r"

We also investigated 18 normal aqueous and eight normal vitreous specimens obtained from patients undergoing cataract or vitrectomy surgery.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the effect of directing and sharing styles of consultation by a general practitioner on patients' satisfaction with the consultation. DESIGN--Patients were randomised to receive a directing or sharing style in the part of the consultation concerned with giving treatment, advice, and prognosis. SETTING--An inner London general practice. PATIENTS--359 Randomly selected patients consulting with one general practitioner. Four patients refused to participate and five were excluded. Thirty failed to complete the initial assessment and 110 failed to complete the assessment a week later, giving response rates of 89% and 58% respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patients' satisfaction with the general practitioner's perceived understanding of their problem and the explanation they received and whether they felt that they had been helped immediately after the consultation and one week later. RESULTS--Patients who had the directing style of consultation reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction on almost all the outcome measures. This was particularly striking for patients with physical problems (excellent explanation 23/68 (34%) v 10/65 (15%), p less than 0.02; excellent understanding 25/68 (37%) v 9/66 (14%), p = 0.004), and for patients who received a prescription (excellent explanation 20/60 (33%) v 9/59 (15%), p less than 0.04; excellent understanding 27/60 (45%) v 10/59 (17%), p = 0.04). There was no significant difference in the responses to the directing and sharing styles in longer consultations (8/31 (26%) v 8/31 (26%)), in which the main treatment was advice (10/30 (33%) v 7/36 (19%)), and among patients with psychological (6/17 (35%) v 6/27 (22%)) or chronic problems (14/28 (50%) v 8/32 (25%)). CONCLUSIONS--Style of consultation does influence the satisfaction of the patient, but its effect is most noticeable in consultations with patients with physical problems and patients who receive a prescription.\r"

It was hoped that this change, along with a renewed emphasis on primary care-oriented residency training within the state, would encourage medical students to establish practices within the state. In 1985 the UNDSM's Center for Rural Health mailed questionnaires to the 2,230 living graduates of the UNDSM to document a variety of their personal and practice characteristics. Based on the responses to the 924 completed questionnaires, the authors found that (1) the students from rural North Dakota were more likely than were urban students to practice in rural areas of the state, as were the students with primary care specialty training; and (2) the alumni completing residencies in North Dakota following the curriculum expansion (1976-1985) were more than twice as likely to establish practices in North Dakota. It was concluded that recruiting medical students (preferably in-state \"natives\") from rural areas, training them in primary care specialty areas, and enabling them to remain in North Dakota for the duration of their medical training (including residency training) combined to exert a considerable \"retaining\" effect on the UNDSM alumni.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes a 1988-1989 collaborative mail survey of faculty opinion about clinical behaviors and skills that students should be expected to demonstrate prior to graduation from undergraduate medical school (hereafter called \"exit objectives\"). Selected faculty from 12 American and Canadian medical schools indicated whether each of 77 objectives was essential for every student to know or demonstrate prior to graduation; useful but not essential at the undergraduate level; or not applicable to their undergraduate program. Their responses provide a glimpse into faculty expectations regarding some of the exit behaviours and skills they deemed essential. Forty-two percent (32) of the 77 objectives were regarded as essential by 75% or more of the faculty members who responded. Essential objectives involved conducting organ system examinations, formulating problems and hypotheses, and gathering fundamental interview, physical, and screening examination data, including emergency examinations of the airway and circulatory systems. Other essential objectives involved collaboration and communication, demonstrating concern for legal and ethical values, and keeping abreast of current information within the discipline. Exit objectives related to the diagnosis and management of specific conditions were regarded as useful but not essential at the undergraduate level. Implications for medical education are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate whether the negative emotions and attitudes that residents develop during internship continue throughout the remaining years of their residency, the authors undertook a four-year prospective study of two classes of internal medicine residents who completed their training in 1985 and 1986 in a residency program based at the Oregon Health Sciences University. Every two to three months over all three years of training, the residents indicated on Likert-type scales their levels of agreement with questions about their career satisfaction and emotional states, and the satisfying and dissatisfying aspects of their residency experiences. Between the internship and the end of their residencies, the physicians indicated significant improvements in their emotions and attitudes. Those experiences identified as satisfying continued to be so, whereas those considered dissatisfying became less so. Although more research of other classes of residents is needed, the findings suggest that while internal medicine internships may be dysphoric, the residents' emotional states and attitudes tend to normalize during the remainder of the residency.\r"

This 1987 survey of 129 pediatrics residency directors sought data about the demographic characteristics of the programs and asked the program directors to what degree they agreed that seven roles (each comprising several competencies) of the general and ambulatory-care pediatrician were essential. There was strong agreement on the seven roles and no demonstrated association between these responses and the residency programs' university affiliations, types of facilities, ages, lengths of training, or geographic locations. The results of this survey may be useful in developing ways to document and evaluate residents' performances and define subspecialty objectives that are consistent with the seven basic roles.\r"

  ".W": "The cost of a medical education may dissuade qualified young people from entering the medical profession or may so load them with debt that they cannot pursue relatively low-paid careers in primary care or clinical investigation. Three aspects of this problem are examined: (1) the cost of medical school, (2) the magnitude of student indebtedness, and (3) the effects of this indebtedness on career choices. High tuition and fees require many students to assume sizable educational debts, some of which are so large that the trainees will be unable to repay them unless they enter highly remunerative specialties. Also, high levels of indebtedness may increase default levels once graduates feel the full impact of scheduled repayments. Several steps would help to alleviate this problem, but are unlikely to solve it. First, medical schools should lower tuition or at least declare a moratorium on increases. Second, limits should be imposed on the amount of total education debt a student is allowed to assume. Third, hospitals with extensive residency programs should assume some responsibility for helping trainees manage their finances. Fourth, the government should institute a loan forgiveness program that addresses the need for physician-investigators, primary care physicians, those willing to practice in underserved areas, and those from underrepresented minorities. And fifth, all institutions involved in medical training and its finance should work together to advise students on managing their debts.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-five years of experience have taught several lessons about shaping science policy. Derived from these lessons are four premises that deserve individual and collective thought: (1) The partnership in U.S. society between health and science interests is fundamentally important; (2) Scientific merit must be the paramount basis for allocating whatever research funds are available; (3) Better data and their careful analysis are vital to the decision-making processes; and (4) More than ever we must have a clear, concise, vigorous, and repeated enunciation of the principles that are essential for a national biomedical research program to flourish. The fourth premise is expressed succinctly in the 11 principles outlined in the 1983 AAMC monograph \"Preserving America's Preeminence in Medical Research,\" which places important responsibilities for the collective success of the U.S. research program on all of the various components of society. Three important factors favor efforts to shape a useful, successful science policy: a public that places improvements in health high on every priority list, a rapidly expanding body of invaluable knowledge, and a sizable investment of tax-derived funds, now totalling over $7.5 billion per year.\r"

Of the 110 cited judicial decisions during that time, 59 (54%) involved disputes over financing medical education; 43 (73%) were litigated since 1985. This dramatic increase arises primarily from challenges to National Health Service Corps obligations and from attempts to discharge or reorganize debt under the Bankruptcy Code. Medical school graduates enjoyed very little success in these cases. Analysis of court decisions points to a need for informed counseling for medical students, particularly as to the consequences of timing in default on service obligations and of incurring loans under the Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) program as opposed to other loan sources. The growing educational debt of today's medical students foreshadows continued litigation in this area.\r"

The quality of VA-sponsored research in all areas remains high and on a par with that supported by the NIH and other governmental agencies sponsoring health research. Recent decreases in the financial support of VA research, however, have led to the unwise curtailment of VACO research staff support for this program, have reduced the number of approved projects that can be funded (though there has been a fourfold increase in the number of approved but unfunded projects), and are likely to reduce the attractiveness of VA employment for highly qualified physicians. In view of these findings, the committee recommended several steps that, if found feasible and taken soon, would both restore the long-standing stature of VA research and assure the attractiveness of VA careers for the many clinician-investigators upon whom the VA's quality of patient care necessarily depends.\r"

  ".W": "In 1988, New York became the first state to implement regulatory measures limiting housestaff work hours. Because restrictions on residents' work hours will have such profound and far-reaching implications for how obstetrics and gynecology residencies are conducted, the Council on Resident Education in Obstetrics and Gynecology (CREOG) requested that a survey be conducted to solicit information from program directors of U.S. obstetrics and gynecology residencies who had already begun to alter their call schedules. Two hundred and ninety-six programs were contacted, and representatives of those that had implemented changes were requested to respond. Eighty-two responses were received; 26 of these contained information that could be collated. From these 26 responses the authors have structured a prototypic call schedule and presented its application. A key feature necessary to implement the new type of schedule is the use of a night float system. It is concluded that changes can and will be made by obstetrics and gynecology residencies. Creative scheduling, as described in this article, is essential and will facilitate the task; however, the current standards of education and patient care will be difficult to maintain without additional economic and human resources.\r"

  ".W": "A national meeting of pathology educators in 1989 provided the impetus for an exploration of new uses of autopsy in medical education. A month before the conference, the authors sent a questionnaire about the uses and value of autopsy in medical education to 120 persons registered to attend the conference. They used the 98 responses, representing 69 U.S. and Canadian medical schools, as the basis of a workshop on the place of autopsy in future medical education. The present article is a report of the authors' findings from the questionnaire and workshop. They found that the uses of autopsy go far beyond the traditional uses in teaching clinical pathophysiology, clinico-pathologic correlations, clinical anatomy, gross and microscopic anatomy of disease, and visual skills. Emphasis was placed on the potential role of autopsy in education regarding legal/judicial proceedings, vital statistics, epidemiologic investigations, and public health, and in the understanding of such complex matters as medical fallibility, medical uncertainty, and grief. These purposes were seen as congruent with current societal concerns about the need to reverse the trend toward dehumanization of medicine and physicians. The inability to realize these aims in the face of a precipitous drop in the autopsy rate is discussed.\r"

Investigators from North America, Europe and Australia contributed data from 1891 people for whom dates of HIV seroconversion were known. We excluded subjects not enrolled in prospective studies at entry and those with more than 25 months between last negative and first positive sera; we also censored subjects at the time last seen and excluded all follow-up after 1987 in order to minimize the impact of newly developed prophylactic therapies. The final analysis cohort contained 1171 subjects. Using actuarial methods, no differences in incubation times were found among homosexual men infected in different continents or in different years (prior to and after 1 January 1985). Among hemophilic people, children developed AIDS more slowly than adults (P = 0.02), and hemophilic adults developed AIDS more slowly than homosexual men (P less than 0.05), mainly because homosexual men had an added risk of Kaposi's sarcoma. Progression time to AIDS was significantly faster in older hemophilic men, but not in older homosexual men. These data illustrate that AIDS incubation may differ in different exposure groups, probably because of different exposures to potential opportunistic pathogens.\r"

San Francisco participants had more non-steady sex partners and were more likely to engage in receptive anal intercourse with non-steady partners than participants from all other sites. Analysis of data on 606 HBV-antibody-negative men interviewed on three occasions in 1978 and 1979 showed no changes in risk indices for insertive and receptive anal intercourse between these years, except in San Francisco where significant declines occurred in insertive anal intercourse and receptive anal intercourse without ejacultion in a small, highly select group of participants.\r"

Sixty-one per cent of these street-recruited IVDUs have initiated deliberate sexual risk reduction in order to avoid AIDS. For the total sample (n = 568), as well as for the male IVDUs, specific health belief and social influence factors were significant predictors of sexual risk reduction. For female IVDUs, drug-risk reduction, having a friend or acquaintance who practices sexual risk reduction, and wanting to have a(nother) child were significant predictors of sexual risk reduction. These findings suggest the importance of social support and community organization to promote risk reduction.\r"

The region was divided into one urban and three rural zones. A multistage cluster sampling technique was adopted. Antibodies to HIV-1 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot analysis. A total of 2,475 adults (aged 15-54 years) and 1,961 children (aged 0-14 years) was studied. The overall prevalence of HIV-1 infection among adults was 9.6%, with a higher prevalence in the urban zone (24.2%) than in the three rural zones (10.0, 4.5 and 0.4%, respectively). The corresponding figures for children were 1.3% overall: 3.9% in the urban area and for the rural areas 1.2, 0.8 and 0.0%, respectively. The age-specific seroprevalence for adults was highest in the age group 25-34 years. The age-standardized sex-specific prevalence was higher among women than men in the urban zone, while it was the same in the rural zones. Change of sexual partners among adults was associated with an increased risk of HIV-1 seropositivity. Travelling outside the region but within the country was also found to be associated with increased risk of HIV-1 infection but only in the rural population.\r"

  ".W": "We carried out a case-control study to investigate the role of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including infection with HIV, as risk factors for adverse outcome of pregnancy. Overall, 1507 women were enrolled within 24 h of delivery. Cases (n = 796) were mothers of low-birthweight infants (less than 2500 g) or of stillborns. Low-birthweight infants were divided into preterms (n = 373) and neonates small for gestational age (n = 234). Stillborns were separated into intrauterine fetal deaths (n = 120), and intrapartum fetal deaths (n = 69). Controls were selected from mothers delivering a live baby of greater than or equal to 2500 g (n = 711). The maternal HIV seroprevalence in the control group was 3.1%. Prematurity was associated with maternal HIV antibody [8.6% seropositive; adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1-4.0], as was being born small for gestational age (7.7% seropositive; adjusted OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.2-4.2). In mothers who delivered a stillborn baby, both intrauterine fetal death (11.7% seropositive; adjusted OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.3-5.5) and intrapartum fetal death (11.6% seropositive; adjusted OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.3-6.5) were independently associated with HIV seropositivity in the mother. Maternal syphilis was confirmed as an important risk factor for intrauterine fetal death (14.3% positive; adjusted OR 4.8; 95% CI 2.4-9.5). No significant association was found between other STDs, including gonococcal and chlamydial infection, and adverse obstetrical outcome. These results suggest an association between maternal HIV infection and adverse obstetrical outcome, defined as low birthweight and stillbirth.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents a theory to explain the development of immunodeficiency disease after a long and variable incubation period of infection with HIV-1. Two assumptions are central to the theory: (1) mutation via reverse transcription during viral replication can generate viral strains resistant to neutralization by antibodies specific to earlier mutants in a particular host; (2) the virus can kill the CD4-positive lymphocytes that play a role in mounting an immunological attack directed at the virus. The theory is examined via the development of a mathematical model which reveals that an increasing number of antigenically distinct viral strains may overwhelm the immune system of the host. As the viral diversity increases beyond a certain level the immune system is unable to suppress the population growth of all the strains simultaneously. The intuitive explanation of this pattern of model behaviour lies in the assumption that each virus can kill CD4-positive lymphocytes that are specific to any of the viral strains, but each lymphocyte only directs immunological attack against a single viral strain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A hospital-based surveillance of HIV infection was implemented in the Bordeaux Regional University Hospital (France). This reporting system, initiated by the Groupe d'Epidemiologie Clinique du SIDA en Aquitaine, identified and followed-up 89 adult patients with transfusion-associated HIV-1 infection (7.2% of all reported cases). Contamination occurred between August 1981 and June 1985 and diagnosis was made between 1985 and 1989. By 30 June 1990, 43 patients (48.3%) had full-blown AIDS, and 28 of them had died. The mean follow-up period was 66 months (s.d. 16 months). The mean incubation period, i.e. The time interval between the contaminating transfusion and the development of full-blown AIDS, was 62 months [median 73 months; 95% confidence interval (CI) 66-82 months]. Five years after contamination, the cumulative probability of reaching the AIDS stage was 34.2% (95% CI 20.3-49.3%), and the probability of survival was 81.7% (95% CI 72.5-90.0%). From this surveillance system we estimate that in south-western France at the end of 1989 the cumulative incidence of transfusion-associated HIV-1 infection was at least 126 cases (45.6 per million inhabitants). Although we anticipate an increase in transfusion-associated AIDS cases over the next 5 years, there have been no reports of contamination after 1 August 1985, when systematic screening of HIV antibodies was implemented in French blood banks. This confirms the efficacy of screening in countries like France where the risk of contamination through blood products is now minimal.\r"

  ".W": "Length of survival was analysed in relation to year of diagnosis, AIDS-indicative disease, age, risk behaviour, zidovudine therapy, and CD4 cell count and serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels at the time of diagnosis in a group of 231 consecutive adult Danish AIDS patients reported before 1 January 1988. The cumulative survival rate was 53% (95% confidence interval 47-59%) at 1 year, 29% (22-36%) at 2 years and 18% (10-26%) at 3 years. Length of survival increased significantly (P less than 0.001) over time for patients who were initially diagnosed with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), 17% (3-31%) at 2 years prior to 1986, 32% (16-49%) in 1986 and 52% (34-69%) in 1987, whereas survival remained stable for patients with other AIDS-indicative diseases. Survival was similar for patients who were diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma alone and PCP alone. Independent predictors of a shortened survival were a CD4 cell count less than 200 x 10(6)/l, a serum IgA level greater than 4 g/l, and an initial diagnosis with opportunistic infections other than PCP. In addition, the multivariate analysis suggested an improved survival in recent years for patients diagnosed with PCP, independent of other factors examined. We conclude that length of survival in AIDS patients is highly variable. Determinants of progression include CD4 cell count, serum IgA level, and presenting disease. Survival has increased markedly for patients with PCP and median survival now exceeds 24 months.\r"

Several alternative functions have been fitted to half-yearly incidence data reported by the countries of the European Community by 31 December 1989 and adjusted for reporting delays. Among homosexual/bisexual men, recent trends in AIDS incidence are more nearly linear than exponential. Higher though less than exponential rates of growth are observed among intravenous drug users and among those presumed infected by heterosexual contact. Extrapolations to the end of 1991 using each of five functions provide a range of forecasts. Projections of total cumulated cases to the end of 1991 lie in the range 60,000-78,000, with 24,000-30,000 projected cases among homosexual/bisexual men, 23,000-33,000 among intravenous drug users, and 6000-8000 in the heterosexual transmission group. With the possible exception of the latter group, the lower parts of these ranges appear more probable.\r"

Matched peripheral blood specimens were obtained from 22 patients in this study, and HIV-1-specific DNA was detected in 100% (22 out of 22) of non-adherent white cell preparations tested. HIV was detected in blood monocytes of 11 out of 22 patients (50%), and a virus signal was also found in the lung macrophages of eight of these patients. Our results indicate that PCP does not predispose lung macrophages to HIV-1, nor does HIV-1 infection of lung macrophages increase the probability of contracting PCP.\r"

This test was evaluated. Data obtained with the Western blot (WB) and the peptide-based ELISA on a first panel composed of sera from 547 patients attending a specialized outpatient clinic (high-risk population) are in perfect agreement; moreover, 39 samples that had falsely been found positive with a viral lysate-based ELISA were not detected by peptide-based ELISA. The second panel was composed of 309 sera which were difficult to resolve using both WB and viral lysate-based ELISA. Using the peptide-based ELISA, 134 were found clearly positive and 173 clearly negative; only two were falsely positive. Finally, sera from 16 individuals examined at the time of seroconversion gave high absorbancy readings even if they were weakly reactive by WB (weak gp160 band). This test is thus highly sensitive and specific, and capable of detecting early seroconversion. It is also instrumental in clearly defining samples that are found indeterminate in the WB, and consequently it avoids the unnecessary follow-up required when a false-positive result is obtained using viral lysate-based ELISA.\r"

Four patients have died, none of pneumocystis infection. One patient with AIDS suffered a mild relapse while receiving 50 mg/day. Hematologic toxicity was mild and could not be definitively attributed to dapsone therapy; rash due to dapsone was documented in two patients. A review of 33 patients at our institution with a history of PCP who received no prophylaxis demonstrated seven relapses, three of which were fatal.

The prevalence and incidence of Reiter's syndrome were determined in 1133 homosexual/bisexual men enrolled in the Johns Hopkins Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study. There was no difference in the prevalence of Reiter's syndrome at entry into the study in 1984 between 357 HIV-positive and 776 HIV-negative men: five per 1000 in both groups. During 5 years' follow-up, one case of Reiter's syndrome developed among each group of HIV-positive and HIV-negative men.

  ".W": "The relation between heart rate variability, measured from standard 24 hour electrocardiogram recordings in patients convalescent after a myocardial infarction, and the occurrence of sudden death and spontaneous, symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachycardia were assessed in a consecutive series of 177 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction and surviving to 7 days. In addition to the analysis of heart rate variability, the occurrence of non-sustained arrhythmias on 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring, and the results of clinical assessment, signal averaged electrocardiography and ejection fraction were analysed and were related to outcome. During a median of 16 months of follow up (range 10-30 months) there were 17 end point events (11 (6.2%) sudden deaths) and six (3.4%) episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. An index of the width of the frequency distribution curve for the duration of individual RR intervals was used to measure heart rate variability. This mean (SD) index was significantly smaller in those with end point events (16.8 (8.0)) than in those without events (29.0 (11.2)). The relative risk of the occurrence of an end point event in those with a heart rate variability index less than 25 was 7.0. Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined a reduced heart rate variability index was the single most powerful predictor of end point events. Measurement of heart rate variability by this simple, automated, operator-independent method provided useful information on the arrhythmic propensity in patients convalescent after myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".U": "91128815\r", 
  ".W": "Skeletal muscle function was measured as force production and fatigue in both the quadriceps (a large locomotive muscle) and adductor pollicis (a small intrinsic hand muscle) in five healthy volunteers, five patients with mild chronic heart failure, and five patients with severe chronic heart failure. The quadriceps of patients with chronic heart failure had a reduced muscle cross sectional area, a reduced maximum isometric force production, and an increased tendency to fatigue. Isometric force production and fatigue of the adductor pollicis, however, were not significantly different between the three groups under control conditions. But during circulatory occlusion fatigue in the adductor pollicis increased more in the patients with severe chronic heart failure. These differing findings in quadriceps and adductor pollicis suggest that skeletal muscle atrophy and reduced isometric force production are not a necessary consequence of chronic heart failure per se, because they were only present in the large locomotive muscle. The normal values for muscle fatigue observed in adductor pollicis in patients with chronic heart failure imply that skeletal muscle blood flow must increase normally during muscle activation when only a small muscle mass is used. These results are not compatible with the concept of a generalised impairment of normal vasodilatation within active skeletal muscle. In contrast, activation of a large muscle, such as quadriceps, results in the rapid onset of fatigue in patients with severe chronic heart failure. This fatigue may be related to the inability of the cardiovascular system to provide the required blood flow for the activation of a large muscle mass.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Relations between movement of the atrioventricular ring and changes in left atrial and ventricular dimensions were studied by echocardiography and compared with apexcardiography and Doppler mitral flow velocity traces in 20 healthy controls and in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 28) or dilatation (n = 16). During left ventricular systole the atrioventricular ring, a structure common to ventricle and atrium, moved towards the ventricular apex, thus increasing left atrial volume. This action matched pulmonary venous return because it was in phase with the transverse left atrial dimension measured from aortic root to posterior left atrial wall. During early diastole, the mitral ring moved rapidly towards the atrium as transmitral flow accelerated. This requires a force directed from ventricle to atrium, likely to be the result of elastic recoil arising from compression of the ventricular myocardium or stretching of the atrial myocardium during ventricular systole. Two additional mechanisms of ventricular filling with atrial systole were recognised: (a) an increase in ventricular volume as the atrioventricular ring moved upwards and (b) transverse left ventricular expansion by pressure driven transmitral flow. The former is undetectable by Doppler from the apex; it accounted for 10% of ventricular filling in the healthy controls, but for significantly less in those with ventricular dilatation. In left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular filling was maintained by both mechanisms compensating for the reduced increase in volume early in diastole. Interactions between the atrium and ventricle are functionally important during ventricular systole, early diastole, and in atrial systole. They are not included in the traditional separation of atrial function into reservoir, conduit, and pump functions.\r"

The end diastolic flow velocity was determined at the peak R wave on a simultaneously recorded electrocardiogram. In all controls there was no reverse flow at the end diastole beneath the aortic isthmus. In patients with aortic regurgitation the end diastolic flow velocity correlated well with the angiographic grade of regurgitation (r = 0.81) and regurgitant fraction (r = 0.82). The mean (SD) values were 6.3 (5.2), 12.2 (4.3), 22.1 (5.7), and 34.3 (9.3) cm/s for patients with regurgitant fraction of less than 20%, between 20% and 40%, between 41% and 60%, and greater than 60%, respectively. An end diastolic flow velocity of greater than 18 cm/s predicted a regurgitant fraction of greater than or equal to 40% with a sensitivity of 88.5% and a specificity of 96%. The study suggests that the pulsed Doppler derived end diastolic flow velocity is a useful index in the routine non-invasive assessment of the severity of aortic regurgitation.\r"

Shunt flow across the foramen ovale was detected in 33 normal infants (92%) within an hour of birth (mean 40 minutes). The occurrence of interatrial shunting decreased with age, but a shunt signal was still detected in 17 infants (47%) on the fourth or fifth day of life, by then the ductus arteriosus had already closed in all the normal infants. The direction of interatrial shunt flow was predominantly left-to-right, but in 64% there was a coexistent small right-to-left shunt in diastole within an hour of birth; by four to five days it was found in 19%. In the six patients with persistent fetal circulation the direction of the interatrial shunt flow was predominantly right-to-left with biphasic peaks in diastole and systole at the early stage of the disease, and the period of right-to-left shunt flow during each cardiac cycle was significantly longer than that in normal infants examined within 1 hour of birth. In all patients the ductus closed before the foramen ovale. At the time of ductal closure in all patients with persistent fetal circulation right-to-left shunt flow was seen during diastole and its period was still prolonged. These findings suggest that interatrial shunting, predominantly left-to-right, is common in normal newborn infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The pressure drop across the aortic valve in the 3 hour old infant was 80 mm Hg. The findings in this patient suggest that the usually accepted theory that prenatally the ventricles function in parallel should take into account the chronology of filling and ejection. In this patient the ability of a ventricle to generate a prenatal transvalvar pressure gradient was evidence that the size, compliance, and contractility of the ventricle were sufficient to maintain good function.\r"

The present study investigated the distribution of SKALP activity in the marginal zone of spreading psoriatic plaques. In a 4-mm zone immediately adjacent to the erythemato-squamous plaques, SKALP activity was slightly increased compared to distant uninvolved skin. Within the lesion the anti-elastase activity was pronounced, but was significantly higher in the central zone of the plaque compared to the periphery. The appearance of SKALP in the psoriatic lesion appears to be a late event compared to endothelial involvement, intraepidermal accumulation of PMNs, epidermal proliferation and abnormal keratinization. This observation lends further support for the hypothesis that the induction of anti-elastase activity is associated with the off-switch of cutaneous inflammation.\r"

All showed a marked clinical improvement and half could omit topical corticosteroid treatment during therapy. Adverse effects were minor, but two patients relapsed despite continued treatment. In the others, the disease recurred soon after stopping CyA. Serum IgE levels and prick-test responses were unchanged by CyA. Immediate and late-phase cutaneous responses to intradermal house dust mite antigen (HDM) were significantly increased during treatment; but a delayed response, present at 24 and 48 h, was unaffected. Four of six patients challenged with HDM patch tests to tape-stripped skin during treatment showed eczematous reactions at 48 h. Thus, cyclosporin A has a powerful therapeutic effect in atopic dermatitis but does not reduce allergic responses to inhalant antigens.\r"

A total of 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 24 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) were diagnosed in 11 of 260 patients. The incidence of both SCC and BCC was increased in comparison with the general Dutch population. The ratio of SCC to BCC in the general population was 1:8 but was 1:2.5 in our study group. A positive correlation was observed between the development of SCC and the total UVA dosage, the age of the patient at the start of the PUVA treatment and a history of arsenic use. This dose-related increase in the incidence of SCC, reported in studies from the U.S.A., has not been found in earlier European studies. The average time period between the start of PUVA therapy and the diagnosis of the first malignant skin tumour was 6.0 years for SCC and 4.7 years for BCC. Among the 49 benign skin tumours were actinic keratoses, a keratoacanthoma and 'PUVA keratoses', a newly described hyperkeratotic lesion, especially found in PUVA-treated patients.\r"

This study investigated the process of selective melanocytotoxicity by N-Ac-4-S-CAP through light and electron microscopy studies of hair follicles obtained from newborn black mice treated with N-Ac-4-S-CAP. Visible changes in follicular melanocytes were found 4 h after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration. Clumps of melanin granules and areas of melanocytic nuclear condensation were seen in the hair follicles. On electron microscopy there was progressive destruction of melanocytes with swelling of membranous organelles, nuclear condensation, and vacuolation of the cytoplasm, culminating in completely necrotic cells. None of these changes were demonstrated in the surrounding keratinocytes. N-Ac-4-S-CAP appears to have specific, cytotoxic effects on melanocytes actively producing eumelanin. The drug may not affect precursor or dormant melanocytes which retain the ability to become active, melanin-producing cells.\r"

Thirty-one patients with DH, seven with bullous pemphigoid, two with linear IgA disease and two healthy subjects were studied either before starting treatment or after stopping dapsone for up to 5 days. Intradermal inoculation of freshly prepared autologous serum was followed after 18-24 h by the formation of DH-like lesions in 24/31 DH patients. The lesions were erythematous papules, often with vesicles and microscopically showed papillary tip microabscesses. Serum-induced formation of lesions only occurred in patients with active DH with some spontaneous lesion formation: it did not occur in any of the non-DH controls. The formation of lesions was dose-related, declining proportionately with dilution of the serum down to 1/16. Plasma prepared by various methods of anticoagulation (heparin, citrate, EDTA) caused lesser reactions, while addition of heparin or epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA), but not citrate, to serum substantially inhibited the formation of lesions. This suggested the responsible factor might be a protease. Other vasoactive agents including histamine (1-4 micrograms) and compound 48/80 (1-5 micrograms) caused normal immediate wealing. DH-like lesions occurred in only one of 13 subjects challenged with histamine and two of nine challenged with 48/80. In all these, autologous serum elicited large vesicular responses. There is a factor(s) in serum in DH which can initiate the formation of lesions. This factor appears to be activated by clotting and can be inhibited by heparin and EACA, suggesting it may be a protease.\r"

  ".W": "The t(1;19)(q23;p13) chromosomal translocation is observed cytogenetically in 25% of children with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and is associated with an adverse treatment outcome. The t(1;19) juxtaposes the E2A gene from chromosome 19 with the PBX1 gene on chromosome 1, leading to the production of fusion transcripts and resultant chimeric proteins that contain the transcriptional-activating motif of E2A and the DNA-binding homeodomain of PBX1. To investigate the molecular nature of E2A/PBX1 fusion in patients with t(1;19) ALL we used an RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure to amplify a portion of the chimeric transcript. We detected E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts in cells from 97% (37 of 38) of cases in which the t(1;19) had been observed cytogenetically. Molecular evidence of E2A/PBX1 fusion transcripts was also observed in a patient in whom a t(1;19) was not detected cytogenetically and in one patient with subclinical levels of minimal residual disease before overt clinical relapse. In all PCR-positive cases the junction of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences occurred at precisely the same location as demonstrated by hybridization of PCR products with a fusion site-specific detection oligonucleotide. These findings demonstrate the consistent fusion of E2A and PBX1 coding sequences resulting from t(1;19) and suggest that site-specific fusion of E2A and PBX1 is an important pathogenic event in t(1;19) ALL.\r"

  ".W": "The subcellular localization of the platelet membrane receptors glycoproteins (GP) Ib and IIb/IIIa [corrected] has been studied within resting platelets by a combination of biochemical and cytochemical techniques. While both GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa are localized within the plasma membrane and surface-connected canalicular system (SCCS) membranes, only GPIIb/IIIa is present within the internal face of alpha-granular membranes. Previous studies demonstrated that plasmin can induce platelet stimulation and also decrease ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation; it was suggested that this was because of GPIb degradation by plasmin. In this study, the respective localizations of both GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa were visualized during in vitro plasmin stimulation of platelets. Generally, plasmin induced shape change, pseudopod formation, organelle centralization either with or without alpha-granule release depending on the conditions of stimulation. Plasmin treatment of platelets at 37 degrees C resulted in the disappearance of GPIb from the cell surface and its subsequent redistribution into the channels and vesicles of the SCCS with no significant modification of GPIIb/IIIa remaining on the plasma membrane. Within degranulated platelets, GPIIb/IIIa was expressed on the plasma membrane and within membranes of large vacuoles containing the alpha-granule proteins. GPIb was virtually absent from these structures and mainly restricted to the SCCS. Addition of cytochalasin D inhibited the migration of GPIb to the SCCS. Biochemical measurements confirmed that no important hydrolysis of GPIb had occurred because only very little amounts of glycocalicin were generated during the reaction. In conclusion, in plasmin-treated platelets GPIIb/IIIa is externalized to the plasma membrane while GPIb is internalized into the SCCS. Although previous studies have suggested that plasmin degrades GPIb, the reduction in ristocetin-induced aggregation may be explained by its apparent redistribution within the membranes of the SCCS.\r"

  ".W": "Based on in vitro data suggesting that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) is capable of stimulating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blast cells to become more sensitive to cell-cycle-specific drugs we conducted a phase I/II study in de novo AML patients (pts). rhGM-CSF (250 micrograms/m2/d, continuous intravenous infusion) was administered in 18 pts suffering from de novo AML in combination with standard induction chemotherapy (3 + 7 = daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 days 1 through 3, cytosine-arabinoside [Ara-C] 200 mg/m2 continuous infusion days 1 through 7). GM-CSF was started 48 or 24 hours before chemotherapy (prephase) in 14 pts. In four pts with high white blood cell counts (WBC) rhGM-CSF was started after chemotherapy-induced cell reduction (WBC less than 30,000/mm3). During prephase GM-CSF induced an increase in neutrophil and blast cell counts in 13 of 14 and 10 of 14 pts, respectively. In vivo recruitment of leukemic cells into drug-sensitive phases of the cell cycle could be demonstrated by multiparameter cell-cycle analyses in peripheral blood (n = 7) and bone marrow (n = 4) specimens. On day 14, complete aplasia was evident in 17 of 18 pts. GM-CSF was administered until recovery from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (absolute neutrophil counts, [ANC] greater than 500/mm3). Fifteen pts (83%) achieved complete remission, 12 did so with one cycle. A shorter duration of neutropenia was evident in these pts compared with historical controls (n = 39), (ANC greater than 500/mm3, day 22.5 +/- 3.4 v 25.2 +/- 3.7, P less than .05). Three pts achieved complete remission after a second cycle (same combination of rhGM-CSF and 3 + 7). Two pts died during bone marrow aplasia because of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Clinical side effects possibly related to GM-CSF, mainly fever, diarrhea, and weight gain were mild and tolerable (World Health Organization toxicity grade less than or equal to 2). Together, rhGM-CSF recruits kinetically quiescient AML cells in vivo to enter drug-sensitive phases of the cell cycle and promotes early myeloid recovery from aplasia after exposure to standard induction chemotherapy for AML.\r"

The majority of patients had advanced Durie-Salmon stage myeloma at diagnosis, all were pretreated with chemotherapy, and six had received prior radiotherapy. At the time of ABMT, all patients demonstrated good performance status with Karnofsky score of 80% or greater and had less than 10% marrow tumor cells. Eight patients had residual monoclonal marrow plasma cells and 10 patients had paraprotein. Following high-dose melphalan and total body irradiation (TBI) there were seven complete responses, three partial responses, and one toxic death. Granulocytes greater than 500/mm3 were noted at a median of 21 (range 12 to 46) days posttransplant (PT) and untransfused platelets greater than 20,000/mm3 were noted at a median of 23 (12 to 53) days PT in 10 of the 11 patients. Natural killer cells and cytotoxic/suppressor T cells predominated early PT, with return of B cells at 3 months PT and normalization of T4:T8 ratio at 1 year PT. Less than 5% polyclonal marrow plasma cells were noted in all patients after transplant. Three of the seven complete responders have had return of paraprotein, two with myeloma, and have subsequently responded to alpha 2 interferon therapy. Eight patients are alive at 18.9 (8.9 to 43.1) months PT and four remain disease-free at 12.3, 17.5, 18.9, and 29 months PT. This preliminary study confirms that high-dose melphalan and TBI can achieve high response rates without unexpected toxicity in patients who have sensitive disease, and that MoAb-based purging techniques do not inhibit engraftment. Although the follow-up is short- and long-term outcome to be determined, relapses post-ABMT in these heavily pretreated patients suggest that ABMT or alternative treatment strategies should be evaluated earlier in the disease course.\r"

  ".W": "Two members of the src proto-oncogene family of intracellular tyrosine kinases, c-fgr and hck, are selectively expressed in differentiated myeloid cells. To study the expression of these genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to determine the specific myeloid lineages and stages of myeloid differentiation at which the expression of these genes is acquired, we used a series of 79 cases of de novo AML as a differentiation model. The levels of c-fgr, hck, and c-fms (encoding the colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor) mRNA transcripts were correlated with the presence of specific cell surface antigens and the morphologic and cytochemical features in these AML blasts. Relatively undifferentiated leukemic myeloblasts with an HLA-DR, CD34, CD33, CD13+/- cell surface immunophenotype (French-American-British [FAB] M1 or M2) were characterized by a lack of c-fms and c-fgr expression, while low levels of c-fms and c-fgr could be detected in undifferentiated myeloblasts (FAB M1 or M2), which also expressed CD14 at low antigen density. The hck transcripts were either undetectable in these cells or were expressed at low levels. In contrast, only hck mRNA transcripts could be identified in blasts with progranulocytic morphology (FAB M3), while c-fms, c-fgr, and hck were all expressed at high levels in blasts with differentiated myelomonocytic or monocytic features (FAB M4 and M5). No c-fms, c-fgr, or hck transcripts were evident in leukemic cells of the erythroid lineage (FAB M6). When undifferentiated leukemic myeloblasts (HLA-DR, CD34, and CD33) were induced to differentiate in vitro to cells with monocytic characteristics, the expression of c-fms, c-fgr, and the CD14 cell surface antigen were induced to high levels, accompanied by the acquisition of hck and CD13 expression. In contrast, when HLA-DR, CD34, and CD33 blasts were induced to differentiate in vitro to cells with granulocytic characteristics, only hck and CD13 expression were induced. Our data suggest that the acquisition of c-fgr and/or hck expression is associated with early commitment and differentiation events in distinct myeloid lineages. Assessment of the expression of these kinases may provide a molecular tool to assign lineage in AML in conjunction with morphology, cytochemistry, and cell surface antigen expression.\r"

  ".W": "A thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (TSF or thrombopoietin) derived from human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells is known to increase platelet production and to increase the number of morphologically unrecognizable early megakaryocytes, ie, small acetylcholinesterase-positive (SAChE+) cells in mice. Other recent studies have concluded that interleukin-6 (IL-6) also stimulates murine megakaryocytopoiesis both in vitro and in vivo. Some workers have suggested that IL-6 is thrombopoietin. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of TSF and IL-6 on percent 35S incorporation into platelets, platelet sizes, and the percentages of SAChE+ cells in C3H mice, and to determine if they produce the same or different responses. The results showed that two or four injections of a partially purified TSF (total dose of 2 or 4 units (U) over a 1- or 2-day period) increased percent 35S incorporation into platelets (P less than .005) and platelet sizes (P less than .005) of both normal and rebound-thrombocytotic mice when compared with values from other mice treated with human serum albumin, the carrier protein for both TSF and IL-6. In eight separate experiments, it was shown that IL-6 (40,000 U, 4 micrograms), when given to rebound-thrombocytotic mice in four injections over a 2-day period, produced a small but significant (P less than .005) increase in percent 35S incorporation into platelets. Additional studies showed that negative results were obtained when similar high doses of IL-6 were administered in two doses over a 1-day period. TSF, but not IL-6, stimulated an increase in platelet sizes of normal mice (P less than .005 to 0.0005); however, IL-6 increased platelet sizes of rebound-thrombocytotic mice when given in two of four injections (P less than .05 to .0005). Also, IL-6, but not TSF, caused anemia in normal mice (P less than .0005) that were given two injections and tested 3 days later. TSF stimulated an increase (P less than .005) in the percentage of SA-ChE+ cells; whereas IL-6, even at high doses, did not. Because of the observed differences in biologic responses of these two cytokines, we conclude that TSF and IL-6 are separate entities.\r"

We have investigated the kinetics of circulating erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocytic-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors after IL-2 therapy in 11 cancer patients, mainly affected by metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Administration of IL-2 from day 1 through day 5 constantly induced a dramatic decrease of the number of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GM, which then showed a striking rebound (up to values fourfold and sevenfold higher, respectively, than the pretherapy levels) on discontinuation of IL-2, ie, from day 5 through day 10. A similar kinetic pattern was observed during and after the second cycle of IL-2 administration. 3[H]-thymidine killing experiments showed that the cycling activity of the progenitors was virtually unmodified in the rebound phases. To explore the mechanism(s) underlying this kinetic pattern, we have analyzed the plasma concentration of several hematopoietic growth factors, including IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, and erythropoietin (Ep). No modifications in the levels of IL-3, GM-CSF, or IL-1 beta were observed, whereas a pronounced increase of IL-6 and G-CSF concentration was monitored, starting at day 3 and peaking at day 5 of treatment (a parallel, but modest, increase of Ep level was also observed). The elevation of IL-6 and G-CSF concentration is directly correlated with and may, at least in part, underlie the subsequent rebound of circulating hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, the increase in IL-4 level observed at day 10 of therapy may mediate the eosinophilia gradually starting at this stage of treatment.\r"

Decreases in plasma cholesterol concentrations were observed during rhM-CSF administration. The observed mean (+/- SD) decreases over a range of doses in nonhuman primates receiving rhM-CSF by continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) or intravenous bolus (IVB) injection were approximately 16% +/- 8% and 43% +/- 10%, respectively. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels decreased 55% +/- 9% from pretreatment baseline values in the animals receiving rhM-CSF by IVB. Normocholesterolemic New Zealand white rabbits receiving rhM-CSF over a range of doses by CIVI showed a decrease from baseline in total cholesterol of approximately 28% +/- 17%, with LDL cholesterol levels decreasing by approximately 72% +/- 33%, while high-density lipoprotein levels showed variable changes, including increased values. A decrease of 36% +/- 26% in total plasma cholesterol was observed in Watanabe Heritable Hyperlipidemic rabbits receiving rhM-CSF by CIVI for 7 days. This decrease was attributable almost entirely to decreases in LDL cholesterol, which fell approximately 34% +/- 24% from baseline. Although the mechanism of this cholesterol-lowering effect is unknown, these results strongly suggest that rhM-CSF may provide a novel treatment for hypercholesterolemia and may be useful in investigations into the mechanisms of cholesterol homeostasis and atherogenesis.\r"

Use of the two techniques has led to different conclusions regarding stem-cell population organization, kinetics, and usage. To better understand this discrepancy, we have combined the two methods by retrovirally marking and transplanting stem cell populations of allophenic mice in which all tissues, including the hematopoietic system, are chimeric. Hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues of engrafted recipients were analyzed by Southern blotting to determine the number and extent of participation of individually marked stem cells. Genotypic chimerism of the same tissues was determined by quantitating electrophoretic variants of glucose phosphate isomerase. This procedure permitted the genotypic identification of individual stem-cell clones. The results demonstrate the participation of few pluripotent stem cells in the repopulation and maintenance of engrafted hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Furthermore, stem cells used during the period of early engraftment tended to be of one genotype (DBA/2), whereas stem cells used for long-term maintenance tended to be of the other, coexistent genotype (C57BL/6). We propose that this genotypic specificity reflects functional differences in stem-cell subpopulations and their relative prevalence in different mouse strains suggests a genetic component in the organization and usage of stem cells.\r"

We first developed a method that was able to recover cultured human EC added to whole blood by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. The final recovery of the EC was 91.6% (SE = 0.65%). The EC were identified in the gradient subfractions by indirect immunofluorescence with the MoAb CLB-HEC 19. This method was then applied to the separation and characterization of EC or EC remnants from the whole arterial and venous blood taken from two groups of patients subjected to heart catheterization. Firstly, a preliminary blood screening of random samples was performed in a group of eight patients (group I) using a scoring evaluation for the presence of EC and the results were expressed as positivity index. Secondly, the complete blood screening of a group of ten patients (group II) was performed for the detection of immunofluorescent cells and the results were expressed as number of EC per milliliter of whole blood. Our results show in both group I and II a significant presence of EC in the blood after catheterization compared with their basal values. The minimal detectable concentration of EC was 0.06 cells/mL (SE = 0.057) of whole blood. We consider this technique as a suitable clinical test for the detection of EC injury in cardiovascular pathology.\r"

  ".U": "91129330\r", 
  ".W": "In washed platelet systems, thrombin has been demonstrated to downregulate the platelet surface expression of glycoprotein (GP) Ib and GPIX. In the present study, we addressed the question as to whether, in the more physiologic milieu of whole blood, downregulation of platelet surface GPIb and GPIX can be induced by thrombin, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and/or by an in vivo wound. Thrombin-induced downregulation of GPIb and GPIX on the surface of individual platelets in whole blood was demonstrated by the use of flow cytometry, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and, to inhibit fibrin polymerization, the peptide glycyl-L-prolyl-L-arginyl-L-proline. Platelets were identified in whole blood by a GPIV-specific MoAb and exclusion of monocytes by light scattering properties. Flow cytometric analysis of whole blood emerging from a standardized bleeding-time wound established that downregulation of platelet surface GPIb and GPIX can occur in vivo. A GPIb-IX complex-specific antibody indicated that the GPIb and GPIX remaining on the surface of platelets activated in vivo or in vitro were fully complexed. Simultaneous analysis of individual platelets by two fluorophores demonstrated that thrombin-induced platelet surface exposure of GMP-140 (degranulation) was nearly complete at the time that downregulation of platelet surface GPIb-IX was initiated. However, degranulation was not a prerequisite because ADP downregulated platelet surface GPIb-IX without exposing GMP-140 on the platelet surface. Inhibitory effects of cytochalasins demonstrated that the activation-induced downregulation of both GPIX and GPIb are dependent on actin polymerization. In summary, downregulation of the platelet surface GPIb-IX complex occurs in whole blood stimulated by thrombin, ADP, or an in vivo wound, and is independent of alpha granule secretion.\r"

A set of 11 human T-cell clones, chosen for their phenotypic diversity, were tested for their ability to express CSF-1 mRNA. After 5 hours of stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) + calcium ionophore (Cal), all T-cell clones expressed a major 4-kb transcript, a less abundant 2-kb transcript, and several other minor species. This pattern of expression is typical for CSF-1 mRNAs. Furthermore, of the two alloreactive T-cell clones analyzed, only one showed a definitive message for CSF-1 on specific antigenic stimulation, but with delayed kinetics and less efficiency. Both conditions of stimulation induced the release of CSF-1 protein by T cells in the culture medium. Together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that normal T cells are able to produce CSF-1, previous reports being limited to two cases of tumoral cells of the T-cell lineage.\r"

Previous immunophenotypic studies have been inconclusive in determining the cellular origin of FDCs. Gene coexpression within individual and highly enriched FDCs was determined using polymerase chain reaction. FDCs contain a very restricted mRNA pattern with high levels of message for the C3d receptor (CR2, Epstein Barr-virus/EBV receptor, CD21) and lack of mRNA for CD20, CD45, CD4, fibronectin, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and beta. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that FDCs may not be of classical hematopoietic or fibroblastic origin. The absence of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-3, and interleukin-6 mRNA provides preliminary evidence that these cells might produce only a very restricted set of cytokines limited to the germinal center.\r"

  ".W": "Although highly active in hairy cell leukemia (HCL), interferons (IFN) are not curative in this disease; current data indicate that prolonged IFN therapy will be necessary to control disease in the majority of patients. We previously observed acquired IFN resistance in association with neutralizing IFN-alpha 2a antibodies in small numbers of patients with HCL. This finding suggests that the requisite long-term therapy may be compromised if there is an increasing incidence over time of neutralizing antibodies. We performed a follow-up study of IFN antibodies in our patients receiving continuous IFN therapy. All 16 patients who were previously antibody negative remained so. Surprisingly, all nine patients who previously had non-neutralizing IFN antibodies became antibody negative after a median of 14.5 months. Moreover, 3 of 10 patients who had neutralizing antibodies became antibody negative and five had only non-neutralizing antibodies a median of 10 months from the time neutralizing antibody had first been detected. Only two patients had persisting neutralizing antibodies. Inhibition of neopterin synthesis, inhibition of generation of 2', 5' oligoadenylate synthetase activity, and inability to detect IFN in serum after subcutaneous injection of IFN-alpha 2a was observed only in the one patient tested with neutralizing IFN antibodies confirming that these antibodies have functional significance in vivo. We conclude that, although neutralizing IFN antibodies inhibit the effectiveness of IFN in vivo, these antibodies are produced only transiently during long-term therapy. The long-term effectiveness of this drug will not likely be affected in most patients by neutralizing antibody.\r"

  ".W": "In the search for immunoreagents appropriate for the histopathologic diagnosis of malignant B-cell lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections, a new monoclonal antibody, Ki-B5, was generated using a high-grade B-cell lymphoma as the immunogene. Ki-B5 is a mouse IgG1/kappa that recognizes five protein fractions of about 84, 82, 55, 48, and 27 Kd after biosynthetic radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation. Protein fractions with the molecular weights of approximately 84 and 82 Kd were expressed on the cell surface and show that Ki-B5 is probably unrelated to CD45. It was possible through electron microscopy to visualize the membrane-bound portion of Ki-B5. Extensive immunohistologic studies on normal human tissue and various neoplasias demonstrated the high specificity of Ki-B5 to normal human B cells and a minor subgroup of plasma cells. Except for ML-2, which is a myelomonocytic human cell line, Ki-B5 exclusively recognized the B-cell lineage, including EB-3, BALL-1, and NALM-1. All carcinomas, sarcomas, and malignant melanomas tested with Ki-B5 were negative. Although normal granulocytes and monocytes were constantly negative, three of eight myelomonocytic leukemias coreacted with this antibody. Eight of the 57 T-cell lymphomas studied were positive to Ki-B5. Five were classified as lymphoblastic, two represented T8-CLL, and one was classified as immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Only 3 of 126 cases of B-cell lymphoma, including rare types not considered in the current classifications, were negative to Ki-B5. Plasmacytomas were also negative, except for one case. Irrespective of the cases of lymphoblastic lymphoma and plasmacytoma, Ki-B5 represents a new monoclonal antibody appropriate for the diagnosis and immunophenotyping of malignant lymphomas in routinely processed paraffin sections.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of tamoxifen (Tmx), verapamil, and daunorubicin (DNR) in two cell lines that displayed the multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype and used laser flow cytometry to quantitate intracellular DNR content. In the vinblastine-resistant human lymphoblastic lymphoma cell line CEM-VBL, simultaneous incubation of DNR with Tmx 10 mumol/L or Tmx 50 mumol/L increased intracellular DNR fluorescence in a dose-dependent manner and demonstrated an uptake pattern similar to that seen with DNR and verapamil. Similar results were obtained in the vincristine-resistant human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60/RV+. Cellular retention of DNR was also measured in both cell lines and results suggested that continuous exposure of the cells to Tmx resulted in higher intracellular DNR content compared with cells resuspended in fresh medium. No effect of Tmx or verapamil was observed in the drug-sensitive parent cell lines CEM or HL-60. Clonogenic experiments were then performed to determine whether Tmx was itself inhibitory to cell growth or whether Tmx potentiated DNR cytotoxicity. Tmx 10 mumol/L did not significantly inhibit either CEM-VBL or HL-60/RV+ cells after a 3-hour exposure followed by culture in methylcellulose. Tmx 50 mumol/L was significantly more inhibitory in both cell lines. However, cells that had been incubated with DNR and Tmx 10 mumol/L demonstrated a marked increment in growth inhibition compared with cells that had been incubated with DNR alone or Tmx 10 mumol/L alone. Based on the data presented here, we suggest that clinical testing of Tmx and DNR be pursued in the setting where MDR may play a role.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported an anti-transferrin receptor antibody, Trump, which was originally selected for its ability to discriminate low- and high-grade lymphomas. This feature was distinct from the other anti-transferrin receptor antibodies such as OKT9. In the present study, further immunochemical analysis was performed to define the nature of the antigenic site recognized by the Trump antibody. Trump was found to block the binding of transferrin both to solubilized and to surface transferrin receptors; conversely, transferrin could block the binding of Trump only to surface transferrin receptors. Therefore, the epitope recognized by Trump is near but not identical to the transferrin binding site. Stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin induced both the OKT9 epitope and the Trump epitope, but 12-phorbol 13 myristate acetate induced only the OKT9 epitope. Growth of some cell lines was inhibited by Trump but not by OKT9. No structural difference was found between transferrin receptor molecules reactive with Trump and those reactive with OKT9. In support of these results, Trump was able to immunoprecipitate transferrin receptor molecules solubilized from low-grade follicular lymphoma cells even though it did not bind to the receptors exposed on the surface of these cells. These findings imply that low-grade lymphoma cells differ from high-grade lymphoma cells not in the structures of their transferrin receptors but in their exposure of the molecule on the cell surface.\r"

  ".W": "The absence of wild type retinoblastoma (Rb) gene expression in a wide variety of human solid tumors suggests an etiologic role for this tumor suppressor gene in human cancer. We have evaluated the involvement of Rb gene inactivation in the pathogenesis and progression of human lymphoma and leukemia. We examined the genomic configuration and transcription of the Rb gene in cultured cell lines and primary cases of T- and B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. By Southern analysis, abnormalities of the Rb locus were identified in 1 of 5 T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL) cell lines, 1 of 26 primary cases of T-ALL, 1 of 40 primary cases of chronic lymphocytic lymphoma/well-differentiated lymphoma (CLL/WDL), and 1 of 15 primary cases of intermediately differentiated lymphoma (IDL). By Northern analysis, markedly reduced or abnormal expression of the Rb gene was identified in 2 of 5 T-ALL cell lines, 1 of 7 primary cases of T-ALL, 1 of 5 primary cases of CLL/WDL, and 1 of 6 primary cases of IDL. These findings show that Rb gene inactivation can be associated with a broad range of lymphoid neoplasms and that loss of the tumor suppressor function of Rb may influence the pathogenesis and progression of lymphoma/leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of sickling on the transmembrane reorientation and distribution of phospholipids in the red blood cells of patients homozygous for sickle cell anemia (SS). To this purpose, we followed the redistribution kinetics of trace amounts of spin-labeled analogues of natural phospholipids first introduced in the membrane outer leaflet of normal or sickle erythrocytes exposed to air or nitrogen. Deoxygenation had no effect on the lipid redistribution kinetics in normal (AA) cell membranes. At atmospheric pO2, unfractionated SS cells were not different from normal cells. However, on deoxygenation inducing sickling, phosphatidylcholine passive diffusion was accelerated and the rate of the adenosine triphosphate-dependent transport of aminophospholipids was reduced, especially for phosphatidylserine. The stationary distribution of the aminophospholipids between the two leaflets was slightly less asymmetric, a phenomenon more pronounced with phosphatidylethanolamine. These changes were rapidly reversible on reoxygenation. When SS cells were separated by density, both dense and light cells exhibited the properties cited above. However, dense cells exposed to air possessed a lower aminophospholipid transport rate. These data favor the relationship between aminophospholipid translocase activity and phospholipid transmembrane asymmetry. Sickle cell disease is the first case of aminophospholipid translocase pathology.\r"
