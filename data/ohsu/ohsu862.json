  ".W": "Studies in depression using a maximal stimulatory dose of corticotropin releasing factor have concluded that elevated resting cortisol levels in depressed patients exert a negative feedback effect on the corticotroph, resulting in a decreased corticotropin response. In this preliminary report, we examine the effects of a submaximal dose of corticotropin releasing factor on the release of another corticotroph secretory product, beta-lipotropin-beta-endorphin. We observed a decreased beta-lipotropin-beta-endorphin response in depressed subjects, but a normal adrenal cortisol response. Although the total beta-lipotropin-beta-endorphin response was decreased, the initial secretory response did not differ between patients and normal controls. Rather, the patients appeared to turn off secretion faster. This rapid shutoff was seen in all patients regardless of resting cortisol levels, suggesting that resting cortisol levels alone do not explain the decreased response seen in depressed patients.\r"

These summaries were used to identify a group of 80 child and adolescent psychiatric patients with an operationally defined depressive syndrome. The depressed children were individually matched with 80 nondepressed psychiatric controls on demographic variables and nondepressive childhood symptoms by a computer algorithm. At follow-up, on average 18 years after the initial contact, information was obtained on the adult psychiatric status of 82% of the total sample. Adult assessments were made \"blind\" to case/control status. The depressed group was at an increased risk for affective disorder in adult life and had elevated risks of psychiatric hospitalization and psychiatric treatment. They were no more likely than the control group to have nondepressive adult psychiatric disorders. These findings suggested that there is substantial specificity in the continuity of affective disturbances between childhood and adult life.\r"

By testing 20 healthy subjects with ultrasonic duplex scanning and controlled limb compression. It was found that the velocity of reflux is related to the external compression pressure. Valve closure is an abrupt cessation of reverse flow. In this study, with subjects in a supine position, valve closure was achieved only after reverse velocities exceeded 30 cm/s. This velocity was not generated by manual compression of the limb. With a Valsalva maneuver, this velocity is achieved only in the common femoral vein in 90% of the tested individuals. The reflux velocities in response to a Valsalva maneuver are progressively lower in more distal veins--the profunda femoris, the superficial femoral vein, and the popliteal vein. With reverse velocities lower than 30 cm/s, the valves will not close and reflux can persist. Valsalva's maneuver only allows a diagnosis of valvular competence at the most proximal level in the venous tree.\r"

  ".W": "Familial polyposis is an inherited syndrome in which untreated persons have virtually a 100% incidence of developing colon cancer. Much controversy exists over whether subtotal colectomy with ileoproctostomy is the appropriate procedure in these patients owing to the risk of subsequent cancer in the retained portion of the rectum. At Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, a group of 25 patients chose to undergo the subtotal colectomy and ileoproctostomy instead of the definitive total proctocolectomy. Of the 25 patients in this series, invasive adenocarcinoma has developed in the rectal segment in only 1 patient. This patient, the oldest in our series, had carcinoma in situ in her initial operative specimen and has done well following an abdominal perineal resection and 13 years of follow-up. Six other patients have subsequently undergone definitive resections of the rectum because of intractable benign polyps. These results compare favorably with those reported in the literature. We conclude that subtotal colectomy with ileoproctostomy is still a useful and successful mode of treatment for select patients with familial polyposis if they are followed up frequently and aggressively and if the surgeon maintains a low threshold for recommending completion proctectomy.\r"

Mice were injected daily for 12 days; the mice were wounded on day 3 of steroid injection, with wound analysis done on day 10 after wounding. Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone significantly impaired wound healing, as assessed by wound disruption strength when compared with controls or methylprednisolone. Dexamethasone and hydrocortisone both displayed dose-dependent relationships for impairment of healing, while over comparative doses, methylprednisolone failed to affect healing significantly. Regression analysis revealed nearly identical curves for hydrocortisone and dexamethasone that differed significantly from that of methylprednisolone. Our observations suggested that these preparations possessed a differential effect on the healing wound that should be considered to minimize postsurgical or traumatic wound-healing problems.\r"

Techniques to restore erections include intracavernous injections of vasoactive substances, vacuum tumescence constriction therapy and penile prostheses. All have potential adverse affects. When reflex function in the sacral cord is present, fertility can be improved by vibratory ejaculation.

GM-CSF began 3 days after completion of induction chemotherapy (ara-C 1.5 g/m2 d x 4 days by continuous IV infusion after a 3 g/m2 bolus). Rates of fatal infection (42%), pneumonia and/or sepsis (83%), and CR (50%) did not differ significantly (P less than .05) from those observed after administration of the identical chemotherapy without GM-CSF to 53 historical controls with newly diagnosed AML at similarly high risk of early death. There were no significant differences between the GM-CSF-treated and the historical groups in the time required to reach neutrophil counts of 500 or 1,000/microL after administration of chemotherapy. Four patients died of infection before they could have benefited from the earliest recovery of neutrophil count observed in patients who entered CR. Growth of leukemia after GM-CSF administration was observed in only 1 of the 8 patients who survived long enough for response to induction therapy to be fully evaluated. This observation suggests that it might be safe to undertake larger, randomized studies, perhaps using earlier administration of GM-CSF, to definitively determine the role of GM-CSF added to chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed AML.\r"

CFU-Eo production by rhIL-3 or rhGMCSF was maximal after 7 days' preincubation. Neither rhIL-1 or rhIL-6 acted on eosinophil precursors, either alone or in combination with rhIL-5, rhIL-3, or rhGM-CSF. A similar spectrum of activity of the cytokines was demonstrated whether rhIL-5, rhIL-3, or rhGM-CSF was used in the secondary cultures as the eosinophil CSF. However, rhIL-3 induced relatively more rhIL-5-responsive CFU-Eo than rhIL-3-responsive CFU-Eo, suggesting that rhIL-3 is pushing progenitors into an rhIL-5-responsive compartment.\r"

Introduction of the human c-fms gene, which encodes the receptor for CSF-1, into 32DC13 cells gave rise to variants that were able to proliferate in medium containing either murine IL-3 or human recombinant CSF-1, but were unable to differentiate to granulocytes in response to G-CSF. Unlike parental 32CD13 cells, CSF-1-responsive derivatives expressed nonspecific esterase when grown in CSF-1, but did not exhibit many other morphologic, immunologic, or functional properties of mononuclear phagocyte differentiation, or express murine CSF-1 receptors. Accelerated turnover of the human CSF-1 receptor was observed in response to CSF-1 and phorbol esters, but not after stimulation with IL-3 or bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Although both CSF-1 and IL-3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of heterologous substrates in the dually responsive cells, differences in the patterns of substrate phosphorylation were observed in response to the two hematopoietins. We conclude that expression of the human CSF-1 receptor in 32DC13 cells not only induces CSF-1 responsiveness, but alters its phenotype in a way that prohibits granulocyte differentiation.\r"

KW-2228 showed two to four times higher specific activity than that of intact rhG-CSF in mouse and/or human bone marrow progenitor cells by colony-forming unit assay in soft agar, and by cell-proliferation assay in liquid culture. KW-2228 showed a potency to increase peripheral neutrophil counts when it was administered to normal C3H/He mice by single intravenous injection. Increase of total leukocyte count and neutrophils was observed, with peak level at 8 to 12 hours at low doses (0.5 to 1.0 micrograms/mouse), and the highest level was maintained for 24 to 30 hours at high doses (5 to 10 micrograms/mouse). The granulopoietic effect of KW-2228 was examined by several doses of single course (once daily for 10 days) or multiple courses (twice daily injection for 5 days followed by cessation for 9 days on one cycle, 3 cycles in total) of treatment. KW-2228 showed higher activity than that of rhG-CSF, especially at sub-optimal doses of multiple courses of treatment. Furthermore, KW-2228 was found to be more stable physicochemically and biologically than intact rhG-CSF, especially under thermal conditions at 56 degrees C and in the human plasma at 37 degrees C, suggesting a protease resistancy. Pharmacokinetic study showed that plasma concentration of KW-2228 assayed for its bioactivity maintained a higher level than that of intact rhG-CSF for 60 minutes after intravenous injection of this protein to normal mice. Those results suggest that KW-2228 might show a superior in vivo hematopoietic effect to intact rhG-CSF due to its high specific activity to progenitor cells, and also due to its improved physicochemical, biologic, and pharmacokinetic stability in host animals.\r"

PBMC of 18 and 19 patients with autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ATP) formed 48 +/- 6.8 (SEM) clusters/well compared with 7.4 +/- 1.0 for control subjects, P less than .001. The number of clusters per well correlated inversely and exponentially with platelet count, r = -.8, n = 21, indicating that the GPIIb-GPIIIa autoantigen is pathophysiologically relevant. Binding of ATP PBMC to immobilized GPIIb-GPIIIa could be inhibited by F(ab')2 fragments of immunoglobulin (Ig) G of ATP patients, indicating that monocyte IgG bound to autoantigen by its F(ab')2 domain. Optimal cluster formation could be obtained with normal monocytes if preincubated with ATP IgG but not with F(ab')2 fragments of ATP IgG, indicating that ATP IgG binds to monocytes by its Fc domain. Armed monocytes (ie, normal monocytes preincubated with ATP IgG) bound to immobilized autoantigen 5.8-fold greater than normal monocytes incubated with immobilized autoantigen opsonized with ATP IgG. Armed monocyte adhesion could be inhibited 81% from 18.9 +/- 1.6 to 3.6 +/- 0.5 clusters/well by prior fixation with 0.1% formalin, whereas fixation of IgG before arming of monocytes was not inhibitory. MoAb MM41, directed against the alpha m-chain of the Mac-1 adhesive protein receptor of monocytes, inhibited cluster formation by 79%. Thus, (1) armed monocyte interaction with autoantigen is considerably more effective than monocyte interaction with opsonized autoantigen; (2) armed monocyte interaction requires specific F(ab')2-antigen recognition; and (3) monocyte-autoantigen interaction requires a secondary nonimmunologic adhesive event.\r"

In this study we present the biochemical characterization of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor on the basophil surface membrane. Highly enriched populations (purity: 92% to 99%) of blood basophils were obtained from chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) patients (n = 3) by negative selection using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement. CGL basophils were found to bind CD25 MoAbs (n = 4) directed against different epitopes of the 55- to 60-Kd subunit of the IL-2 receptor (= Tac peptide). Immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates of purified CGL basophils and CD25 MoAbs showed a protein with a molecular weight of 60 Kd, equivalent to the Tac peptide on human T blasts. Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis using radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-2 indicated the presence of 12,000 +/- 4,700 low affinity IL-2 binding sites (kd = 66 nmol/L) per purified CGL basophil. Northern blot analysis with enriched CGL basophils showed two messenger RNA bands of 3.5 and 1.5 kilobases hybridizing to radiolabeled Tac cDNA. Immunoprecipitation of the Tac peptide from enriched basophils metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine showed active synthesis of the IL-2 receptor. Our results show that human blood basophils synthesize and express receptors for IL-2.\r"

  ".U": "90234865\r", 
  ".W": "Lymphocyte function-associated antigens 1 and 3 (LFA-1, LFA-3) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) are cell surface adhesion molecules necessary for immune processes requiring intercellular contact. It was recently proposed that malignant Burkitt's lymphoma cells (BL) may escape from immunosurveillance through the downregulation of LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) or LFA-3 (CD58) and ICAM-1 (CD54) molecules. Expression of these three adhesion antigens was investigated in 19 BL lines. LFA-1 or LFA-3 expression was found to be absent or low in 8 of 11 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genome positive BL, but strongly expressed on all nonmalignant EBV genome positive lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL). Negative or weak expression of LFA-1 and LFA-3 was also observed in 7 of 8 EBV genome negative BL. ICAM-1 was found to be expressed on the cell surface of the majority of BL lines. BL lines growing as individual cells did not express LFA-1, whereas clump-forming BL lines expressed this marker involved in B-cell homotypic aggregation. Expression of LFA-1 and LFA-3 was induced on in vitro infection of EBV-negative BL cells with the immortalizing EBV strain B95-8, and weakly with the nonimmortalizing EBV strain P3HR1. EBNA2 and LMP, two EBV encoded proteins expressed in LCL and in BL infected with B95-8 (BL/B95-8), are not expressed in P3HR1 infected BL cells (BL/P3HR1). Stable expression of EBNA2 after gene transfer in a BL/P3HR1 cell line did not restore the level of LFA-1 and LFA-3 found on BL/B95-8 cells. In EBV-positive BL cells expressing LFA-1 and LFA-3, LMP was found coexpressed, supporting the recent finding of the role of LMP in B-cell adhesion receptor activation. Consequently, diminished LFA-1 and LFA-3 expression appears to be a common characteristic of numerous EBV-positive BL as well as EBV-negative BL. These findings are discussed in the framework of BL pathogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Very young reticulocytes are released into the circulation in response to the stress of anemia. These stress reticulocytes have shortened in vivo survival when transfused into normal recipients, and are generally considered to be abnormal because they have skipped a terminal cell division. We reevaluated one aspect of their abnormality: that of in vivo survival. Using methodology that accounted for all cells transfused, in vivo survival of both normal and stress reticulocytes was investigated in both normal and anemic recipients. The experiments demonstrate that: (1) survival of reticulocytes is normal only when normal reticulocytes are injected into nonanemic animals; (2) intrinsic properties of stress reticulocytes lead to their immediate removal from the circulation by normal recipients to a significantly greater extent than by anemic recipients; and (3) both stress and normal reticulocytes are removed at an accelerated rate over time by anemic recipients. Taken together, the data indicate that in the course of becoming anemic, an adaptation occurs that allows cells produced during anemia to circulate considerably longer in anemic animals than they could in normal nonanemic animals. Other studies disclosed that increased reticulocyte survival in anemic animals could not be attributed to reticuloendothelial overload, but is induced by adaptation of the spleen, decreasing its removal of stress reticulocytes.\r"

JET was defined electrocardiographically as an incessant tachycardia with normal QRS morphology and atrioventricular (AV) dissociation. The ventricular rate ranged from 140 to 370 beats/min (mean, 230 beats/min); 16 of 26 patients had cardiac failure. Treatment success was defined as a stable decrease in the rate of JET, below 150 beats/min; partial success was a significant decrease of JET rate with alleviation of symptoms. All patients received digoxin with no significant effect. Propranolol was given to 16 patients, with two successes and one partial success. Combinations of other conventional agents were used in 11 patients with two successes; 14 patients were treated with amiodarone, which resulted in eight successes and three partial successes; three patients died suddenly on medical treatment (amiodarone, one patient; propranolol, one patient; or amiodarone plus propranolol, one patient); sudden AV block was a possible cause and consequently, two later patients had pacemaker implantation as well as medical treatment. His catheter ablation was successfully performed twice but contributed to death in a newborn; three surgical His ablations were performed for intractable JET with two successes and one death. The overall mortality was 35%. Among survivors, treatment has been stopped without any complications in five patients ranging in age from 10 months to 8 years (mean, 3.5 years). It seems that amiodarone alone is the best drug for treatment of congenital JET; necessity for permanent pacing remains unsettled. His ablation should be reserved only for intractable JET.\r"

The study took place in an outpatient research clinic in a university-affiliated Veterans Administration medical center. Twenty-seven men with untreated diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 90-104 mm Hg were randomized to the two exercise regimens. Ten patients completed the aerobic regimen. Nine patients completed the control regimen, seven of whom subsequently entered and completed the aerobic regimen. The aerobic regimen consisted of walking, jogging, stationary bicycling, or any combination of these activities for 30 minutes, four times a week, at 65-80% maximal heart rate. The control regimen consisted of slow calisthenics and stretching for the same duration and frequency but maintaining less than 60% maximal heart rate. DBP decreased 9.6 +/- 4.7 mm Hg in the aerobic exercise group but increased 0.8 +/- 6.2 mm Hg in the placebo control exercise group (p = 0.02). Systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased 6.4 +/- 9.1 mm Hg in the aerobic group and increased 0.9 +/- 9.7 mm Hg in the control group (p = 0.11). Subsequently, seven of the nine controls entered a treatment crossover and completed the aerobic regimen with significant reductions in both DBP (-6.1 +/- 3.2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and SBP (-8.1 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). BP changes were not associated with any significant changes in weight, body fat, urinary electrolytes, or resting heart rate. This randomized controlled trial provides evidence for the independent BP lowering effect of aerobic exercise in unmedicated mildly hypertensive men.\r"

  ".W": "Safe and effective clinical application of new interventional therapies may require more precise imaging of atherosclerotic coronary arteries. To determine the reliability of catheter-based intravascular ultrasound as an imaging modality, a miniaturized prototype ultrasound system (1-mm transducer; center frequency, 25 MHz) was used to acquire two-dimensional, cross-sectional images in 21 human coronary arteries from 13 patients studied at necropsy who had moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis. Fifty-four atherosclerotic sites imagined by ultrasound were compared with formalin-fixed and fresh histological sections of the coronary arteries with a digital video planimetry system. Ultrasound and histological measurements correlated significantly (all p less than 0.0001) for coronary artery cross-sectional area (r = 0.94), residual lumen cross-sectional area (r = 0.85), percent cross-sectional area (r = 0.84), and linear wall thickness (plaque and media) measured at 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees (r = 0.92). Moreover, ultrasound accurately predicted histological plaque composition in 96% of cases. Anatomic features of the coronary arteries that were easily discernible were the lumen-plaque and media-adventitia interfaces, very bright echoes casting acoustic shadows in calcified plaques, bright and homogeneous echoes in fibrous plaques, and relatively echo-lucent images in lipid-filled lesions. These data indicate that intravascular ultrasound provides accurate image characterization of the artery lumen and wall geometry as well as the presence, distribution, and histological type of atherosclerotic plaque. Thus, ultrasound imaging appears to have great potential application for enhanced diagnosis of coronary atherosclerosis and may serve to guide new catheter-based techniques in the treatment of coronary artery disease.\r"

Ring preparations of porcine proximal coronary artery were suspended in a Magnus apparatus filled with Tyrode's solution at 37 degrees C and aerated with 100% O2, and the isometric tension of the contractions was measured. Insulin itself caused neither contraction nor relaxation. Insulin had no significant effect on the coronary artery contractions evoked by 20 mM K+, norepinephrine, histamine, and serotonin; however, 120 minutes of preincubation with a physiological concentration of insulin (30-300 muunits/ml) significantly accentuated coronary artery contractions evoked by STA2 (10(-11) to 10(-7) M), a stable analogue of TXA2 that is known to act on TXA2/prostaglandin H2 receptors (141.4 +/- 10.9% of the control at 10(-7) M STA2 in the presence of 300 muunits/ml insulin; p less than 0.01). The enhancing effects of insulin on the STA2-induced contractions were affected by extracellular glucose or magnesium ion concentrations. The enhancing effects of insulin were observed only at the glucose concentrations of 100-300 mg/dl and magnesium concentrations of 0.5-1.5 mM. Therefore, insulin was suspected of enhancing TXA2-induced contraction through a process that depends on extracellular glucose and Mg2+.\r"

  ".W": "Rearrangements of immunoglobulin (Ig) and T cell receptor (TCR) genes provide a highly sensitive molecular marker for the detection of clonality in lymphoid lesions and allow the pathologist to (1) distinguish polyclonal from monoclonal lymphoid proliferations, (2) provide corroborative evidence for lineage when used in conjunction with immunophenotypic techniques, (3) differentiate clonal lymphoid lesions from poorly differentiated nonlymphoid neoplasms, and (4) assess residual disease at the molecular level. The use of these probes in conjunction with morphology and immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry allows the pathologist to assign virtually all lymphoid neoplasms to the B or T cell lineage. The cloning of Ig and TCR genes also has led to the identification of new protooncogenes that reside at the breakpoints of chromosomal translocations frequently observed in lymphoid neoplasms. Molecular probes for these new genes involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoid neoplasms may be used as additional molecular markers for the determination of clonality, lineage, and even histologic subtype of lymphoid neoplasms. Finally, the development of new molecular technologies such as polymerase chain reaction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis has provided new tools for the highly sensitive detection of genetic rearrangements in human tumors and will greatly enhance the ability of the pathologist to monitor minimal residual disease and detect early relapse.\r"

  ".W": "Classic histopathologic study revealed a series of highly treasured criteria for diagnosing central and peripheral nervous system neoplasms. The advent of immunohistochemistry galvanized further improvements in the accuracy of diagnostic neurooncologic pathology, and moreover, enriched our understanding of tumor histogenesis. Now with the tremendous technical advances in immunodetection and the commercial availability of high-quality monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, the potential for first-rate diagnostic assessment is available to practically every laboratory, regardless of how small or remotely located. Intensive immunohistochemical analysis of nervous system neoplasms has taught us that neuroectodermal cells have a limited repertoire of highly redundant antigenic phenotypes and that neoplastic cells usually mimic their non-neoplastic immature or fully differentiated counterparts. These observations led to the concept that a panel of antibodies ought to be used to identify the \"immuno-gestalt\" of tumors, because it is often difficult if not impossible to subcategorize the tumors on the basis of a single immunohistochemical determination. The ensuing tour through the immunodiagnostic neurooncology summarizes approximately 10 years of original work in this field. I have attempted to provide consensus opinions, and whereever appropriate, highlight dissenting arguments. The salient immunohistochemical features of most nervous system tumors also are summarized in tabular form to facilitate diagnostic considerations at your own institutions.\r"

  ".W": "As with neoplasms in any tissue, skin tumors may be categorized as epithelial or mesenchymal, benign or malignant, and primary or metastatic. Immunoperoxidase stains are useful in elucidating the nature of the tumor cells, especially in poorly differentiated tumors. It is important to consider that tumors may exhibit staining patterns different from the typical or reported results. This may be because of intrinsic features of the neoplasm such as the aberrant expression of antigens (markers). Furthermore, the staining of the tumor may be affected by tissue preservation and fixation as well as by the selection of antibodies used for staining. For this reason, the pathologist should be vigilant in comparing the results of unknown tumors with standard controls, with results in the literature, and with his or her own experience. Unusual neoplasms may require additional tissue for analysis, study by other ancillary methods such as electron microscopy, or consultation by more experienced laboratories. These guidelines should be helpful in providing accurate diagnosis of skin tumors.\r"

For these reasons, we anticipate that the plastic section technique will have a wide variety of research and investigative applications.\r"

  ".W": "The centralized management of manual and automated information systems in hospitals, including the medical record, is usually delegated to administrators rather than to physicians. It is also likely that the importance of automated information systems will increase rapidly as the medical record is electronified. Many significant changes have occurred in recent years relating to the manner in which information systems are managed in hospitals. To address the challenge of this new information environment, hospital Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) have begun to create a new executive hospital position called the Chief Information Officer (CIO). CIOs are included in the hospital executive cabinet and commonly direct all hospital information systems, telecommunications, and management engineering. Although the model of the physician-director of an information system is common at the departmental level with the Laboratory Information System as one example, physicians rarely serve within the central hospital administration as information specialists such as the CIO. Although many physicians would be suitably qualified to serve in this capacity, another option for them would be the position of Chief Medical Information Officer (CMIO) with responsibility for utilization review, medical records, and quality assurance. The CMIO would serve centrally on a part-time basis, continuing to practice simultaneously in a medical specialty. The medical information specialist must not be insulated from the flow of clinical information and discourse with medical colleagues because of the increasing use of information systems for improving work efficiency and the pursuit of quality goals.\r"

  ".U": "90235487\r", 
  ".W": "An ideal immunohistochemical screening panel would be one in which each antibody is 100% sensitive and specific for the target cell type (e.g., markers for epithelial neoplasms, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc.). Anyone who has practiced immunochemistry is well aware that this situation does not exist. High sensitivity is hindered by the loss of key antigens through formalin fixation and routine tissue processing. Although sensitivity can be improved by dealing with fresh-frozen, lyophilized, or plastic-embedded specimens, these procedures are often perceived as inconvenient by pathologists. Specificity is a more insidious problem. With the advent of monoclonal antibody technology, many individuals equated the monospecificity (e.g., marking one antigen a determinant) with tissue specificity. This, of course, is not the case as determinants recognized by one monoclonal antibody may be expressed on cells of different lineage. High sensitivity and high specificity are important for different reasons. By definition, an undifferentiated neoplasm lacks morphologic features to unequivocally substantiate sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoma, or melanoma. Thus, antibodies with low sensitivity that fail to mark a significant percent of cases will provide inconclusive or erroneous information. The failure of an antibody to stain a particular tissue could be a true-negative (valuable information) or a false-negative (misleading information) result. Obviously, when antibodies have a sufficiently low sensitivity, their use is a liability rather than an advantage. Specificity is obviously important. When an undifferentiated neoplasm is found to be \"positive\" for a particular marker, there is a tendency to immediately categorize the neoplasm. In this setting, when histologic features of cellular differentiation are totally lacking, an extreme degree of trust is being placed on the immunohistochemical technique. From our earlier discussion it is apparent that perfect sensitivity and specificity do not exist among most immunohistochemical reagents. Accordingly, the safest approach is to use a panel of antibodies that will disclose anomalous immunohistochemical reactions (e.g., a neoplasm positive for both keratin and LCA). Specimens from such cases should be carefully evaluated with additional monoclonal antibodies and scrutinized by light microscopy. Furthermore, while immunohistochemistry provides for rapid and cost-effective diagnosis, electron microscopy may still contribute valuable information. Despite our best intentions and desires, it is also clear that a small percentage of \"undifferentiated\" neoplasms will remain undifferentiated. Quality control and quality assurance are two final, but important, issues to address. An extraordinary large number of variables in tissue selection, fixation, and processing can skew results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Ultimately, the application of MAbs resides in the importance of tumor-associated antigen expression and phenotyping of tumors with therapeutic and prognostic implications.\r"

  ".W": "In assessing the value of systematic evaluation of extrathoracic extension for potentially resectable, non-small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma, a prospective study was conducted in 146 patients. The study protocol included computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain and upper abdomen, abdominal ultrasonography, and whole-body bone scanning. The findings were matched with the clinical presentation, histologic features, and TN staging, having found out that non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma does not follow a set pattern to metastasize. The rate of metastasis for adenocarcinoma is not only significantly larger (p less than 0.05) but it does not correlate with the TN staging, in contrast to what happens with the squamous cell carcinoma (p less than 0.01). None of the squamous cell carcinomas in intrathoracic stage I was found to metastasize. Twenty-one percent (4/19) of brain metastases were asymptomatic (three adenocarcinomas and one squamous cell carcinoma with multiorgan metastasis). Bone scanning detected metastasis in 3.4 percent (4/116) of the asymptomatic patients, and three of the four patients with asymptomatic metastasis had nonskeletal foci. In 61 percent (11/18) of patients with hepatic metastasis, we did not find organ-specific indicators to suspect it. The series showed a 7.5 percent incidence of adrenal metastasis. Our findings suggest the convenience of performing an upper abdominal CT scan and/or ultrasonography in all patients, except for those with asymptomatic stage I squamous cell carcinoma; we also suggest brain CT scanning for all patients with adenocarcinomas and large-cell carcinomas as well as for those with squamous cell carcinoma with neurologic symptoms, and whole-body bone scanning only in those patients with clinical and laboratory indication of possible bone involvement by metastatic disease.\r"

Cytomegalovirus was detected in 51 percent of the BALs in the patients with HIV infection and 25 percent of the immunosuppressed patients without HIV. No association was found in the HIV infected patients between CMV and hypoxemia, abnormal chest roentgenogram, leukopenia, and increased mortality. As indicated by mortality, CMV did not significantly increase the severity of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. The study also suggested that CMV in BAL fluid reflected bronchopulmonary replication of the virus, and not contamination by virus in the blood. Cytomegalovirus does not appear to contribute directly to the pulmonary disease found in most patients with HIV infection.\r"

In an outpatient department supervised by a physiotherapist, we evaluated 28 patients with severe stable CAO (FEV1, 32 percent of predicted). Patients were randomly allocated to either a control (eight), upper-limb (six), lower-limb (seven), or combined (seven) exercise group. The upper-limb group trained with a circuit of upper-limb exercises, the lower-limb group by walking, and the combined group with both. Exercise was for one hour three times per week for eight weeks. Assessment before and after training included pulmonary function, mouth pressures, respiratory muscle endurance, maximal bicycle exercise test, maximal and submaximal arm ergometer, six-minute walking distance, and a scale of well-being (Bandura scale). Twenty-six patients completed the program. There was a significant improvement (Wilcoxon rank sum test) in the following: six-minute walking distance in the lower-limb (p less than 0.005) and combined (p less than 0.003) groups; arm ergometer in the upper-limb (p less than 0.005) and combined (p less than 0.04) groups; and the scale of well-being in the combined (p less than 0.005) group. There was no significant change in any other parameter measured. We conclude that exercise training improves exercise performance in severe CAO, that the training is specific for the muscle group trained, and that upper-limb exercises should be included in training programs for these patients.\r"

Fifty-six patients had thoracotomy at which all accessible lymph nodes were sampled. Twenty-four patients were found to have mediastinal tumor on histologic analysis of the resected mediastinal lymph nodes. Neither 57Co-bleomycin scanning nor barium swallow were clinically useful, with sensitivities of 21 percent and 11 percent respectively, whereas CT scanning was helpful. However, there was no clear cutoff point of node size to optimize sensitivity and specificity for CT scanning. When nodes greater than or equal to 15 mm were taken to indicate likely malignancy, the sensitivity was 58 percent and the specificity was 87 percent and when greater than or equal to 10 mm was used the sensitivity was 80 percent but the specificity was only 55 percent. There was no clear relationship between the size of the largest resected lymph node in each patient and the presence of malignant lymph nodes. Only 42 percent of patients with resected nodes greater than or equal to 2 cm had histologic evidence of metastases. We conclude that CT scanning should be used to indicate the presence and site of mediastinal lymph nodes, which, when visualized, should always be sampled and histologically examined prior to resection of primary tumor.\r"

End-diastolic area of the right atrium decreased significantly in both groups. The RA pressure increased, while transmural pressure remained unaltered. The CI decreased in both groups.

Sequential hemodynamic studies were conducted in 13 patients with severe falciparum malaria. Seven patients developed PE, while the other six patients had NPE. Two patients died, one in each group. Hemodynamic changes were found in both groups, including an initial reduction in SVR and PVR, along with an increased CI and variable values (normal and increased) of PCWP. All abnormalities persisted for at least two days; changes in PVR lasted especially longer (throughout five days). The initial hemodynamic changes cannot predict the development of PE; however, heavy parasitemia of more than 60 percent and severe hypoalbuminemia were found to be more common in PE than NPE. Of three patients with PE who had normal PCWP, one died, with postmortem findings of increased pulmonary capillary permeability. The increased PCWP which was found in the other four cases of PE was proven to be volume overload without evidence of CHF. It was concluded that the pathophysiologic changes in severe falciparum malaria were systemic and pulmonary vasodilation. The abnormal pulmonary vascular change was found to be the cause of PE. Volume overload and hypoalbuminemia could aggravate further pulmonary capillary leakage in these cases.\r"

  ".W": "Normal sleep provides a period of physiologically reduced workload for the cardiovascular system for almost one third of the human life span. Snoring, the most common disorder of sleep, heralds the presence of an unstable upper airway and alerts perceptive clinicians to the possibility of OSA. Epidemiologic evidence has implicated snoring as an independent risk factor for the development of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and cerebral infarction. However, many investigators would attribute these adverse cardiovascular effects to the substantial prevalence of OSA in habitual snorers. The detrimental effects of OSA on hemodynamics and cardiac rhythm have been well documented, and recent data have linked OSA with increased cardiovascular mortality. Worsening hypoxemia during sleep likely contributes to the nocturnal mortality observed in patients with severe COPD. Effective treatment to prevent nocturnal hypoxemia is available for OSA and COPD, with current evidence supporting beneficial effects on survival.\r"

Approximately 10(6) organisms were incubated in yogurt, milk, broth, and modifications of these materials. Aliquots were removed at various intervals and plated on MacConkey's agar for enumeration of E. coli. Yogurt was bactericidal (at least 5 log10 reduction in bacterial counts) to all three strains of E. coli with less than 10 CFU/ml remaining by 9 hr. In contrast, all three strains replicated rapidly in milk and broth, reaching maximum concentrations by 9 hr. The E. coli strains survived and multiplied in milk acidified to the same pH as the yogurt. Yogurt (native pH 4.1-4.4) in which the pH was brought up to and maintained at pH 5.5 or pH 7 for 8 hr was not bactericidal to E. coli. Heat-treated yogurt and the filtered supernatant of centrifuged yogurt (both containing no yogurt bacteria) were only bacteriostatic. We conclude that both live yogurt bacteria and a pH near 4.5 are necessary for the bactericidal activity of yogurt. The possibility that yogurt ingestion could protect against infection via other foods contaminated with pathogenic E. coli merits further in vivo investigation.\r"

It appears that PCOS typically arises from masculinized regulation of the androgen-forming enzyme (cytochrome P450c17 alpha) within ovarian thecal cells. This may arise by either excessive stimulation by luteinizing hormone (LH) or by escape from desensitization to LH. We review evidence which is compatible with the concept that the latter situation may result from an intrinsic intraovarian flaw in the paracrine feedback mechanism by which thecal androgen biosynthesis is inhibited and that coexistent adrenal 17-ketosteroid hyper-responsiveness to corticotropin (ACTH) may be due to a similar type of dysregulation of adrenocortical P450c17 alpha.\r"

Forty patients suffering from longstanding infertility of male (n = 17), cervical (n = 2), and idiopathic (n = 21) origin were randomly assigned into four distinct treatment modalities during 4 consecutive cycles. A total of 132 cycles were analyzed. In 35 cycles treated with CC plus IUI, five conceptions were achieved, whereas three pregnancies occurred in 32 inseminated spontaneous cycles. Only 1 patient conceived after timed intercourse in 31 CC stimulated cycles, and no pregnancy resulted from 34 spontaneous cycles combined with timed intercourse. There was a statistically significant higher conception rate in cycles in which IUI was performed, whereas the use of CC does not seem to improve the pregnancy rate. Analysis of results for other modifying factors did not substantially affect the relative risk (odds ratio) of pregnancy.\r"

Both groups with follicle cysts demonstrated a higher luteinizing hormone peak and continuous elevated estradiol (E2) levels. In group M2, the E2 rise and the cysts persisted longer compared with group L2. Gonadotropin treatment was accordingly postponed until the cysts regressed spontaneously. Only two cases of group M2 required aspiration of the cysts.

The pregnancy rate per couple in the group with abnormal semen was lower than in the group with mucus hostility (22% versus 38.9%). Influence of seminal and other parameters on outcome of IUI was assessed by discriminant analysis, and a significant correlation with pregnancy rate was found for motile sperm count and sperm morphology. Teratozoospermia (normal morphology less than 50%) affected the outcome of IUI both when associated with moderate oligozoospermia and/or asthenozoospermia (motile sperm count greater than or equal to 5 X 10(6)/mL) (success rate per couple: 11.1%), and, even more, when associated with severe oligozoospermia and/or asthenozoospermia (motile sperm count less than 5 X 10(6)/mL), where no pregnancy was achieved. In the absence of teratozoospermia, the success rate per couple both in severe and in moderate oligozoospermia and/or asthenozoospermia had similar results (33.3% versus 35.7%). In conclusion, the absence of teratozoospermia appears to be an effective criterion for selecting couples with infertility due to oligozoospermia and/or asthenozoospermia who may benefit from IUI.\r"

Expression of this enzyme is differentially regulated; hepatic glucokinase is stimulated by insulin and repressed by cAMP, whereas beta-cell glucokinase activity is increased by glucose. Recently, the glucokinase gene has been characterized and was found to contain two different transcription control regions. One region regulates transcription of the gene in the liver, whereas the other region, which lies at least 12 kilobases further upstream, controls transcription in the pancreatic beta-cell. The finding of two different transcription control regions in a single glucokinase gene provides a genetic basis for the tissue-specific differential regulation of glucokinase and will serve as the basis for further studies to identify and characterize the different regulatory elements and factors in the liver and beta-cell, which are presumably involved. Comparison of different glucokinase cDNAs isolated from hepatic, insulinoma, and islet cDNA libraries indicates that at least three glucokinase isoforms are generated by differential RNA processing of the glucokinase gene transcripts. Whether any of these glucokinase isoforms are functionally unique remains to be determined.\r"

After 2 min of insulin injection via the portal vein into livers, three major bands of 170,000, 140,000, and 95,000 Mr were stimulated. Because the incubation of nitrocellulose membrane with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies in the presence of 40 mM phosphotyrosine completely abolished these bands, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies appear to recognize the phosphotyrosine residues of these proteins. Insulin injection (2-2000 micrograms) very quickly stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, insulinlike growth factor I or epidermal growth factor injection had little effect in stimulating the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins. Because anti-insulin-receptor antibodies immunoprecipitated a tyrosine-phosphorylated 95,000-Mr protein, this protein must be the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor; i.e., the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor and two other proteins were phosphorylated at tyrosine residues in vivo by insulin injection. These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin receptor may have important roles in in vivo insulin action.\r"

  ".U": "90236141\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the metabolic consequences of pancreas transplantation with systemic venous drainage on beta-cell function, we examined insulin and C-peptide responses to glucose and arginine in type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic pancreas recipients (n = 30), nondiabetic kidney recipients (n = 8), and nondiabetic control subjects (n = 28). Basal insulin levels were 66 +/- 5 pM in control subjects, 204 +/- 18 pM in pancreas recipients (P less than 0.0001 vs. control), and 77 +/- 17 pM in kidney recipients. Acute insulin responses to glucose were 416 +/- 44 pM in control subjects, 763 +/- 91 pM in pancreas recipients (P less than 0.01 vs. control), and 589 +/- 113 pM in kidney recipients (NS vs. control). Basal and stimulated insulin levels in two pancreas recipients with portal venous drainage were normal. Integrated acute C-peptide responses were not statistically different (25.3 +/- 4.3 nM/min in pancreas recipients, 34.2 +/- 5.5 nM/min in kidney recipients, and 23.7 +/- 2.1 nM/min in control subjects). Similar insulin and C-peptide results were obtained with arginine stimulation, and both basal and glucose-stimulated insulin-C-peptide ratios in pancreas recipients were significantly greater than in control subjects. We conclude that recipients of pancreas allografts with systemic venous drainage have elevated basal and stimulated insulin levels and that these alterations are primarily due to alterations of first-pass hepatic insulin clearance, although insulin resistance secondary to immunosuppressive therapy (including prednisone) probably plays a contributing role. To avoid hyperinsulinemia and its possible long-term adverse consequences, transplantation of pancreas allografts into sites with portal rather than systemic venous drainage should be considered.\r"

Tissue protein content was measured on the subsequent days of gestation (days 20-22), and protein synthesis was determined at day 20 of gestation in fetal tissues after intravenous injection of [3H]phenylalanine into the maternal circulation, followed by measurements of tissue free and protein-bound phenylalanine specific radioactivity in fetal diaphragm, brain, heart, and liver. Rates of protein degradation in these fetal tissues were calculated by subtracting protein accretion rates from rates of protein synthesis. The injection of insulin to rat fetuses at day 19 of gestation resulted in relative macrosomia versus saline-injected controls from the same litter (body wt at day 20 of gestation, 3.26 +/- 0.15 g for saline-injected fetuses and 3.60 +/- 0.25 g for insulin-injected fetuses, P less than 0.001) and increased protein and RNA content of brain, heart, and liver. Although fractional rates of protein synthesis were not significantly elevated in tissues from the hyperinsulinemic fetuses, absolute rates of protein synthesis were increased in brain, heart, and liver of hyperinsulinemic fetuses. Hyperinsulinemia did not reduce calculated rates of protein breakdown in fetal brain, heart, or liver but did in fetal diaphragm. We conclude that the major effect of fetal hyperinsulinemia on protein turnover in rats is to increase protein synthesis in selected tissues without simultaneously affecting protein breakdown.\r"

  ".W": "It is unknown among first-degree relatives of individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) whether the disease process occurs in relatively few but always progresses to clinical IDDM or whether subclinical disease is more common but remains nonprogressive in many cases. Islet cell antibodies (ICAs) were found in 21 of 724 (2.9%) first-degree relatives during screening in the greater Seattle area between 1983 and 1988. Measures of beta-cell function (glucose disappearance rate [Kg], fasting insulin, acute insulin response to intravenous arginine [AIRarg], acute insulin response to intravenous glucose [AIRgluc], slope of glucose potentiation of AIRarg) and insulin sensitivity were obtained. Twenty individuals, 9 ICA+ relatives and 11 ICA- relatives, were evaluated prospectively. When expressed in relation to the expected AIRgluc based on each subject's sensitivity index, AIRgluc in 18 of 20 relatives fell below 100%, indicating inappropriately low insulin secretion (subclinical beta-cell dysfunction). After a median follow-up of 42 mo, 10 of 11 ICA- relatives remained ICA-. None showed deteriorating beta-cell dysfunction, and none developed diabetes. Five ICA+ relatives showed persistent immunologic positivity. beta-Cell function remained remarkably stable in all except 2 relatives. One was a 15-yr-old boy who developed IDDM shortly after screening and before evaluation of beta-cell function could be carried out. The other was an 18-yr-old monozygotic twin who developed IDDM after 27 mo. Both of these individuals had ICAs of 80 Juvenile Diabetes Foundation U and had been discordant for less than 5 yr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To describe quantitatively the in vivo distribution and elimination of insulin, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of human insulin labeled with 125I at tyrosine A14 (A14-125I-insulin) as a tracer. Intact A14-125I-insulin levels were determined by HPLC and trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation in plasma and various tissues after its intravenous bolus injection into mice. TCA precipitation consistently overestimated the intactness of A14-125I-insulin compared with HPLC, possibly due to the presence of both a TCA-precipitable intermediate degradation product of labeled insulin found in HPLC elution profiles and reported high-molecular-weight forms of labeled insulin in plasma. Thus, TCA precipitation gave a considerably lower total plasma clearance (Cltot) value than HPLC. The half-life of A14-125I-insulin was prolonged by a simultaneous injection of 8 U/kg unlabeled insulin, and labeled insulin behaved similarly to [14C]inulin (an extracellular fluid marker). The concentration time profiles of HPLC-separated labeled insulin in plasma were analyzed by a noncompartmental moment method, and both Cltot and steady-state apparent volume distribution (VDss) of A14-125I-insulin were considerably decreased by unlabeled insulin coadministration. In particular, VDss of labeled insulin decreased by 79%, similar to that of inulin (181 ml/kg), suggesting that the nonspecific binding of labeled insulin to tissues was so small that VDss of labeled insulin was reduced to the extracellular fluid volume (approximately 20% of the body weight) when its receptor binding was blocked effectively by unlabeled insulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of free fatty acids (FFAs) on insulin binding and action was investigated in isolated rat hepatocytes. Oleic acid (0.4 mM) added to the cells rapidly (within 45 min) reduced insulin binding and degradation (each by 45%; P less than 0.001, n = 7) without changing the apparent receptor affinity. The effect was concentration dependent; a half-maximal inhibitory effect occurred at 0.150 +/- 0.050 mM (mean +/- SE). Oleic acid exerted no effect on insulin binding in energy-depleted (KCN-treated) cells. Oleic, palmitic, stearic, palmitoleic, and eicosapentaenoic acids were equally effective in reducing insulin binding. FFA did not change insulin binding to partially purified insulin receptors, thus excluding a direct effect on the insulin receptor. Furthermore, binding to partially purified receptors from solubilized cells pretreated with 0.2 mM oleic acid was not changed, indicating the effect of FFA in intact cells is on the rate of receptor internalization and/or recycling. Concomitant with the effect on insulin binding, oleic acid elicited a concentration-dependent reduction in nonstimulated cellular [14C]aminoisobutyric acid uptake (AIB; 29 +/- 8%, P less than 0.05) and decreased the maximal effect of insulin (39 +/- 7%, P less than 0.05). Thus, in a concentration-dependent manner, different fatty acids can reduce the number of binding sites for insulin and the degradation of insulin by isolated liver cells. Basal and insulin-stimulated AIB transport was reduced, suggesting the presence of postbinding perturbations. These data suggest that FFA exerts an important modulating effect on insulin action in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of silica, which is selectively toxic to macrophages, to young BB rats resulted in the prevention of insulitis and diabetes. However, the mechanism leading to the prevention of an autoimmune process in silica-treated BB rats is not known. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism involved in prevention of insulitis and diabetes. Neonates of diabetes-prone BB (DPBB) rats injected with concanavalin A (ConA)-activated spleen cells from silica-treated DPBB (STDPBB) rats did not develop insulitis or diabetes, whereas DPBB neonates injected with ConA-activated spleen cells from the untreated DPBB rats developed both insulitis and diabetes. Not only was there a decrease of natural killer (NK) cell activity in splenocytes from STDPBB rats, but there was also a significant reduction in the number of immunocytes such as T lymphocytes (helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor) and NK cells. The number of macrophages in both spleen and peripheral blood was significantly decreased in STDP rats compared with untreated DP rats. In contrast to the changes in T lymphocytes and NK cell activity, there was no change in target beta-cells in STDPBB rats with regard to the susceptibility to adoptive transfer of insulitis. It is concluded that the prevention of insulitis and diabetes in STDPBB rats is due to a decrease in macrophage-dependent T lymphocytes and NK cell cytotoxicity.\r"

Mean fasting plasma glucose was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in control subjects (mean +/- SE 77 +/- 2 mg/dl) than in relatives (84 +/- 2 mg/dl). Mean basal insulin levels were not significantly different between relatives and control subjects (10.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.0 microU/ml). Mean basal HGO was significantly lower in control subjects compared with relatives (1.83 +/- 0.07 vs. 2.20 +/- 0.10 mg.kg-1.min-1, P less than 0.05). Mean MCR was similar in relatives (2.58 +/- 0.12 mg.kg-1.min-1) and control subjects (2.35 +/- 0.09 mg.kg-1.min-1). In summary, this study demonstrates that basal hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization are increased in glucose-tolerant first-degree relatives compared with healthy control subjects. We conclude that impaired basal hepatic glucose regulation rather than glucose disposal is present as an early defect in glucose-tolerant first-degree relatives of NIDDM patients.\r"

Q was determined in a major retinal vein at baseline and then 5 days, 2 mo, and 6 mo after the institution of strict control. Level of retinopathy was assessed from stereocolor fundus photographs taken at baseline and 6 mo. After 6 mo of strict diabetic control, five eyes demonstrated progression (P) by one or more retinopathy levels, and eight eyes showed no progression (NP). At 5 days, there was a significant decrease in Q of 1.4 +/- 0.9 microliters/min (P less than 0.005) in NP eyes and a nonsignificant increase in Q of 1.2 +/- 1.7 microliters/min in P eyes. Changes in Q from baseline observed at 5 days were strongly correlated with changes in retinopathy level at 6 mo (r = 0.79, P less than 0.005). No significant changes in Q from baseline were observed at 2 and 6 mo. A lack of decrease in Q at 5 days was associated with the progression of retinopathy that occurs in some patients after the institution of strict glycemic control and may serve as a predictor for progression of retinopathy.\r"

The decrease in NCV was less marked in the insulin-treated STZ-D rats (n = 11; 36.3 +/- 0.9 m/s, P less than 0.05 vs. control). VIP content in sciatic nerve decreased in the untreated STZ-D rats (1.33 +/- 0.23 ng/g wet wt) compared with the other groups (control, 3.10 +/- 0.44, P less than 0.01; insulin-treated STZ-D, 2.44 +/- 0.55, P less than 0.05). However, in spinal cord, VIP content was not significantly different among the three groups. The VIP levels in sciatic nerve showed a positive correlation with NCV (r = 0.430, P less than 0.01). In addition, an inverse correlation between VIP levels and blood glucose levels was observed (r = -0.5624, P less than 0.001). NCV was also inversely correlated with blood glucose levels (r = -0.7662, P less than 0.001). Together with a previous morphological study, these findings suggest a possible causal relationship between reduced VIP content and diabetic neuropathy.\r"

To determine whether IAPP is a pancreatic secretory product, we measured the quantity of IAPP-like immunoreactivity (IAPP-LI), insulin, and glucagon released into 5 ml of incubation medium during a 2-h incubation of monolayer cultures (n = 5) of neonatal (3- to 5-day-old) Sprague-Dawley rat pancreases under three conditions: 1.67 mM glucose, 16.7 mM glucose, and 16.7 mM glucose plus 10 mM arginine and 0.1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). The quantity of IAPP-LI, insulin, and glucagon in the cell extract was also determined. Mean +/- SE IAPP-LI in the incubation medium increased from 0.041 +/- 0.003 pmol in 1.67 mM glucose to 0.168 +/- 0.029 pmol in 16.7 mM glucose (P less than 0.05) and 1.02 +/- 0.06 pmol in 16.7 mM glucose plus arginine and IBMX (P less than 0.05 vs. 1.67 or 16.7 mM glucose).

Glucagon release tended to decrease with the increase in glucose concentration (0.39 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.33 +/- 0.02 pmol, P less than 0.1), whereas with the addition of arginine and IBMX to high glucose, glucagon release increased to 1.32 +/- 0.03 pmol (P less than 0.05 vs. 1.67 or 16.7 mM glucose).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Moreover, we studied the effect of somatostatin analogue SMS 201-995 on glucose-induced IAPP secretion in nondiabetic subjects. Plasma IAPP concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay. Oral administration of 75 g glucose (n = 8) significantly increased plasma IAPP levels from 4.5 +/- 0.7 to 14.0 +/- 1.7 pM (P less than 0.01) 60 min after administration. Intravenous administration of 10 g glucose (n = 7) also caused a significant increase in plasma IAPP from 5.0 +/- 0.4 to 11.6 +/- 0.9 pM (P less than 0.01) 5 min after injection. Plasma IAPP significantly decreased from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 2.9 +/- 0.4 pM (P less than 0.01) 60 min after intravenous insulin injection (n = 8). Pretreatment with SMS 201-995 completely abolished IAPP and insulin secretion to intravenous glucose injection. A significant correlation was found between plasma IAPP and insulin levels in oral and intravenous glucose administration and between plasma IAPP and C-peptide levels during insulin-induced hypoglycemia. These results suggest that IAPP is cosecreted with insulin in response to a glucose load and secretion of IAPP is inhibited by hypoglycemia and somatostatin. IAPP may serve as a novel pancreatic hormone to control carbohydrate metabolism.\r"

This transport stimulation is effected by receptors on both the luminal and basolateral membranes of cells located predominantly in the early, S1 proximal tubule. Angiotensin II increases transport primarily by a Gi protein-mediated reduction in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, which enhances the affinity of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter. Change in early proximal acidification ultimately causes alteration in the amount of sodium chloride leaving the proximal tubule and entering the urine. These direct tubular transport actions by angiotensin II may participate importantly in various physiological actions of the kidney, including the renal response to change in dietary sodium intake and in extracellular volume, as well as in pathophysiological processes such as hypertension.\r"

It did not alter heart rate at these doses. At 10 mg/kg i.v., DuP 753 decreased blood pressure significantly for at least 24 hours, suggesting a long duration of the antihypertensive effect. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 did not cause a transient increase in blood pressure. The acute antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 was greater than that of captopril. Our data indicate that, for captopril to reduce blood pressure to a similar extent as that of DuP 753, it would need to be supplemented by a diuretic. DuP 753 did not have an acute diuretic effect. Bilateral nephrectomy, but not inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, abolished the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753, suggesting that the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 is dependent on an active renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, DuP 753 inhibited the pressor response to angiotensin II but not the responses to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and Bay K 8644 (a calcium agonist). As neither DuP 753 nor captopril decreased blood pressure acutely in Wistar-Kyoto normotensive rats, our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the control of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats.\r"

Plasma atrial natriuretic factor, arginine vasopressin, renin activity, and aldosterone concentration did not show significant differences between hypertensive and normotensive individuals or a correlation with plasma endothelin-1 levels. These data suggest that circulating endothelin-1 may be partly involved in the development or maintenance of hypertension in humans.\r"

  ".W": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats have reduced peripheral insulin sensitivity. To determine whether hypertensive rats demonstrate reduced response to the antinatriuretic effect of insulin, urinary sodium excretion was determined in hypertensive and normotensive rats (n = 7 per group) before and during euglycemic insulin administration at two infusion rates (21 milliunits/kg load and 4 milliunits/kg/min or 85 milliunits/kg load and 8 milliunits/kg/min). Hypertensive and normotensive time controls received the vehicle for insulin administration. Mean arterial pressure was greater (p less than 0.05) and inulin clearance was less (p less than 0.05) in hypertensive than normotensive rats before insulin infusion. Baseline fractional sodium excretion was not different between groups. Low dose insulin infusion reduced (p less than 0.05) fractional sodium excretion from 0.81 +/- 0.43% to 0.31 +/- 0.07% in hypertensive rats and from 1.05 +/- 0.37% to 0.47 +/- 0.18% in normotensive rats. High dose insulin infusion reduced (p less than 0.05) fractional sodium excretion from 0.67 +/- 0.22% to 0.21 +/- 0.08% in hypertensive rats and from 0.81 +/- 0.15% to 0.30 +/- 0.09% in normotensive rats. Sodium excretion was unchanged in time controls. The reduction in sodium excretion was similar in both rat groups during low dose and high dose insulin infusions. Mean arterial pressure and inulin clearance were unchanged from baseline values during insulin infusion in all rat groups. Glucose requirement to maintain euglycemia was greater (p less than 0.05) in normotensive than hypertensive rats at both insulin infusion rates. Thus, while hypertensive rats have reduced sensitivity to the hypoglycemic effects of insulin, the antinatriuretic response to insulin is not different from that of normotensive rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Although hyperinsulinemia and increased adrenergic activity have been postulated to be important factors in obesity-associated hypertension, a cause and effect relation between insulin, catecholamines, and hypertension has not been established. The aim of this study was to determine whether chronic hyperinsulinemia, comparable with that found in obese hypertensive patients, causes hypertension in normal dogs, increases plasma catecholamines, or potentiates the blood pressure effects of norepinephrine. In six normal dogs, insulin infusion (1.0 milliunits/kg/min) for 7 days, with euglycemia maintained, increased fasting insulin fourfold to sixfold. However, mean arterial pressure did not increase, averaging 99 +/- 2 mm Hg during the control period and 91 +/- 3 mm Hg during the 7 days of insulin infusion. Insulin did not alter plasma norepinephrine or epinephrine, which averaged 171 +/- 27 and 71 +/- 14 pg/ml, respectively, during the control period and 188 +/- 29 and 45 +/- 12 pg/ml during the 7 days of insulin infusion. In six dogs, norepinephrine was infused (0.2 microgram/kg/min) for 7 days to raise plasma norepinephrine to 2,940 +/- 103 pg/ml. Insulin infusion (1.0 milliunits/kg/min) for 7 days during simultaneous infusion of norepinephrine did not further increase mean arterial pressure, which averaged 101 +/- 3 during norepinephrine and 98 +/- 2 mm Hg during insulin plus norepinephrine infusion. Thus, chronic hyperinsulinemia did not increase mean arterial pressure or plasma catecholamines and did not potentiate the blood pressure actions of norepinephrine. These observations provide no evidence that chronic hyperinsulinemia or interactions between insulin and plasma catecholamines cause hypertension in normal dogs.\r"

  ".W": "In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), impaired glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (PI)-anchoring of membrane proteins such as decay-accelerating factor has been known to lead to increased susceptibility to complement. Moreover, abnormal expression of non-PI-anchoring glycoproteins such as C3b/C4b receptor (CR1) or glycophorin-alpha also has been shown in PNH. Therefore, we biochemically analyzed glycosphingolipids (GSL) as one of the membrane glycoconjugates of PNH erythrocytes. Erythrocytes of all seven PNH patients showed altered expression of sialosyl GSL (gangliosides) as compared with the control erythrocytes of healthy donors. Both a sialosylparagloboside (IV6NeuAc-nLc4Cer) among four major gangliosides and some minor gangliosides in normal erythrocytes variably disappeared in erythrocytes from the peripheral blood of PNH patients. As one of the possible mechanisms of altered expression of gangliosides in PNH erythrocytes, structural analysis suggested impaired sialylation of GSL. These results suggest not only the altered metabolism of gangliosides in PNH erythrocytes, but also a metabolic disorder of membrane glycoconjugates as a new feature of PNH.\r"

This study reports the purification and characterization of human seminal clusterin. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed charge differences between clusterin purified from semen and the serum-derived material. Both preparations demonstrate comparable hemagglutination (clustering) activity and inhibition of C5b-6 initiated hemolysis. The average clusterin concentration in normal seminal plasma is considerably higher than that found in serum. Mean seminal plasma clusterin concentrations were significantly lower in azoospermia caused by obstruction or seminiferous tubule failure than with oligospermia or normospermia. Only men with vasal agenesis had undetectable seminal clusterin, suggesting that some of the seminal clusterin is produced by the seminal vesicles. Immunofluorescence of human spermatozoa revealed that clusterin was detected on 10% of spermatozoa, predominantly those that were immature or had abnormal morphology. A pilot study of 25 patients suggests that seminal clusterin concentration, together with sperm motility and morphology, is correlated with the fertilization rate in vitro. The function of seminal clusterin is unknown. Its extensive distribution in the male genital tract and its high concentration in seminal plasma suggests an important role in male fertility.\r"

Intercellular adhesion was low and unchanged by stimulation of the PMN with zymosan activated serum or platelet activating factor (PAF) at concentrations that significantly enhance PMN adhesion to protein-coated glass and canine endothelial cell monolayers. Intercellular adhesion was significantly increased only when both myocytes and PMN were stimulated (e.g., myocytes incubated with IL-1, tumor necrosis factor, or phorbol myristate acetate, and PMN were chemotactically stimulated). Inhibitors of protein synthesis diminished the IL-1 beta-induced effect by greater than 80%. The IL-1 beta, PAF-stimulated PMN-myocyte adhesion was associated with substantial H2O2 production. Under conditions with low PMN-myocyte adhesion (i.e., IL-1 beta alone, PAF alone, or no stimulus) H2O2 production was generally less than 5% of that occurring with high adhesion. An anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody (R15.7) inhibited stimulated PMN-myocyte adhesion by greater than 95% and reduced H2O2 production by greater than 90%. Control isotype-matched, binding, and nonbinding antibodies were without effect on adherence or H2O2 production. The results indicate that cytokine stimulation of adult myocytes induces expression of a ligand involved in CD18-dependent adherence of canine neutrophils.\r"

In laboratory animals the ABM is inaccessible to phlogogenic amounts of ABM Ab unless the permeability of the unfenestrated alveolar endothelium is increased. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that in the mouse polypeptide mediators, generated by activated lymphoid cells or cells infected by viruses, contribute to the pathogenesis of passive Goodpasture's hemorrhagic pneumonitis. In naive mice that received rabbit ABM Ab, these bound to the glomerular basement membrane but not to the ABM and their lungs were normal. In the lungs of mice injected with human recombinant IL-2 and IFN-alpha specific binding of ABM IgG, C3, and fibrinogen to the ABM, diffuse and severe erythrocyte extravasation, and accumulation of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were constantly observed. ABM Ab and IL-2 or ABM Ab and IFN-alpha did not produce comparable effects. Mice injected only with IL-2 and IFN-alpha had enlarged, edematous lungs without pulmonary hemorrhages. The results show that the synergism of IL-2 and IFN-alpha convert the lung into a preferential target for AMB Ab, suggesting that cytokines may have a role in the pathogenesis of human Goodpasture's pneumonitis.\r"

We have previously demonstrated widespread binding sites for ET-1 in blood vessels, heart, kidney, adrenal, lung, and brain in a distribution that paralleled that of endothelial cells. To determine whether these cells are capable of synthesizing ET-1 in close proximity to its binding sites, amplification of cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization were used to study the distribution of ET-1 mRNA. We have found widespread transcription of ET-1 mRNA in human and porcine tissues. The identity of the transcripts was confirmed by prediction of restriction fragment lengths or sequencing. In situ hybridization in the kidney showed that the regional expression of these transcripts is localized, probably to small blood vessels, but the failure to visualize ET-1 mRNA in the capillaries may reflect absence of expression or insufficient sensitivity of the technique. These results should permit investigation of the role of ET-1 as a local factor in vascular pathophysiology.\r"

The cDNA was subcloned into an expression plasmid vector, pEX, to express its protein product as a fusion protein with cro-beta-galactosidase in Escherichia coli. A recombinant pEX plasmid expressing three-fourths of the protein (amino acid 112-408) was also constructed. The antigenicities of these recombinant proteins were confirmed with a patient's serum. Their various deletion mutants were produced with exonuclease III treatment from the 3' ends of the cDNAs without changing the proper translational frame. Immunoblot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate the reactivities of the recombinant proteins with patients' sera to determine the autoepitopes. A narrow segment (amino acid 88-101) and the region where several epitopes were located (amino acid 283-338) on the SS-B/La protein were universally recognized by all the sera with anti-SS-B/La antibodies examined. An additional epitope region (amino acid 179-220) was recognized by some patients' sera. Computer analysis revealed that the most distinct autoepitope, amino acid 88-101, had a striking homology to a retroviral gag polyprotein. These findings indicate that exogenous or endogenous retroviruses may play a role in initiation of the anti-SS-B/La autoimmunity.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine has been proposed to act within the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) as a mediator of the inhibition of renin secretion produced by a high NaCl concentration at the macula densa. To test this hypothesis, we studied the effects of the adenosine1 (A1)-receptor blocker 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (CPX) on renin release from single isolated rabbit JGAs with macula densa perfused. The A1-receptor agonist, N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), applied in the bathing solution at 10(-7) M, was found to inhibit renin secretion, an effect that was completely blocked by adding CPX (10(-5) M) to the bath. Applied to the lumen, 10(-5) M CPX produced a modest stimulation of renin secretion rates suppressed by a high NaCl concentration at the macula densa (P less than 0.05). The effect of changing luminal NaCl concentration on renin secretion rate was examined in the presence of CPX (10(-7) and 10(-5) M) in the bathing solution and in vehicle control experiments. The control response to increasing luminal NaCl concentration was a marked suppression of renin secretion, that was maintained as long as luminal NaCl concentration was high and was promptly reversible when concentration was lowered. CPX did not alter renin release when luminal NaCl was low, but diminished the reduction caused by high NaCl (P less than 0.01). It is concluded that A1-receptors are located within the JGA, and that A1-receptor activation inhibits renin release. A high NaCl concentration at the macula densa appears to influence A1-receptor activation, but a low NaCl concentration does not. The findings support participation of adenosine in macula densa control of renin secretion.\r"

Circulating glucose was elevated to two hyperglycemic levels using a clamp technique for 1 h at each level. The mean arterial glucose concentration was 4.95 +/- 0.29 (control), 8.33 +/- 0.31 and 10.84 +/- 0.60 mumols/ml, respectively. Glucose extraction increased significantly from control (0.15 +/- 0.13 mumols/ml) during each level of the glucose clamp (0.28 +/- 0.12, P less than 0.02, and 0.54 +/- 0.14 mumols/ml, P less than 0.005, respectively). Myocardial production of 14CO2 showed that during control 9 +/- 10% of exogenous glucose was oxidized immediately upon extraction. Despite a significant increase in the amount of exogenous glucose oxidized with level II hyperglycemia, it represented only 32 +/- 10% of the glucose extracted. [13C]Lactate analysis showed that the myocardium was releasing lactate; during control 40 +/- 30% of this lactate was derived from exogenous glucose and during hyperglycemia this value increased to 97 +/- 37% (P less than 0.005). Thus, these data show that during short-term hyperglycemia, myocardial glucose extraction is enhanced. However, despite increases in exogenous glucose oxidation and the contribution of exogenous glucose to lactate release, the majority of the extracted glucose (i.e., 57%) is probably stored as glycogen.\r"

  ".W": "A myo-inositol-related defect in nerve sodium-potassium ATPase activity in experimental diabetes has been suggested as a possible pathogenetic factor in diabetic neuropathy. Because the sodium-potassium ATPase is essential for other sodium-cotransport systems, and because myo-inositol-derived phosphoinositide metabolites regulate multiple membrane transport processes, sodium gradient-dependent amino acid uptake was examined in vitro in endoneurial preparations derived from nondiabetic and 14-d alloxan diabetic rabbits. Untreated alloxan diabetes reduced endoneurial sodium-gradient dependent uptake of the nonmetabolized amino acid 2-aminoisobutyric acid by greater than 50%. Administration of an aldose reductase inhibitor prevented reductions in both nerve myo-inositol content and endoneurial sodium-dependent 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake. Myo-inositol supplementation that produced a transient pharmacological elevation in plasma myo-inositol concentration, but did not raise nerve myo-inositol content, reproduced the effect of the aldose reductase inhibitor on endoneurial sodium-dependent 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake. Phorbol myristate acetate, which acutely normalizes sodium-potassium ATPase activity in diabetic nerve, did not acutely correct 2-aminoisobutyric uptake when added in vitro. These data suggest that depletion of a small myo-inositol pool may be implicated in the pathogenesis of defects in amino acid uptake in diabetic nerve and that rapid correction of sodium-potassium ATPase activity with protein kinase C agonists in vitro does not acutely normalize sodium-dependent 2-aminoisobutyric acid uptake.\r"

As insulin regulates transcription of the growth hormone (GH) gene, we tested nuclear extracts from unstimulated and insulin-stimulated Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells for binding to four human GH (hGH) gene promoter oligonucleotide fragments identified as target-binding sequences by DNAse I footprinting. Using a mobility shift assay, an insulin-induced DNA-binding protein was identified. This protein binds to two upstream overlapping oligonucleotide sequences. Binding activity is present at low levels in unstimulated CHO cells and is stimulated by insulin treatment with a time course suggesting that protein synthesis is required. Incubation of the cells with cycloheximide and puromycin confirmed that de novo protein synthesis is necessary for the increased binding activity. Competition with excess unlabeled specific competitor oligonucleotides prevented binding, while unrelated similar-sized oligonucleotides failed to compete for binding, indicating that the observed DNA-protein complex formation is specific. A protein of approximately 70-80 kD was detected by gradient gel electrophoresis. In conclusion, insulin-mediated DNA-protein binding has been identified on the upstream hGH promoter, suggesting a trans-active role for insulin in mediating polypeptide hormone gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Human monocytes cultured on adherent IgG produce a specific IL-1 inhibitor that functions as a receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). This molecular has been purified, sequenced, cloned as a cDNA, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Recombinant IL-1ra has 17,000 mol wt and binds to IL-1 receptors on T lymphocytes, synovial cells, and chondrocytes with an affinity nearly equal to that of IL-1. These studies have examined some biological properties of purified recombinant human IL-1ra. This protein exhibits a dose-responsive inhibition of Il-1 alpha and Il-1 beta augmentation of PHA-induced murine thymocyte proliferation. The recombinant IL-1ra also blocks IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta stimulation of PGE2 production in human synovial cells and rabbit articular chondrocytes, and of collagenase production by the synovial cells. A 50% inhibition of these IL-1-induced biological responses requires amounts of IL-1ra up to 100-fold in excess of the amounts of IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta present. IL-1ra may play an important role in normal physiology or in pathophysiological states by functioning as a natural IL-1 receptor antagonist in the cell microenvironment.\r"

In all cases the stellate and multinucleate stromal cells characteristic of these lesions stained strongly for desmin, indicating muscle intermediate filament production. In common with uterine fibroleiomyomata, numerous mast cells were also often seen. Myoglobin staining was negative. Electron microscopical examination confirmed that the stromal cells contained abundant thin filaments with focal densities and also showed the ultrastructural features usually associated with myofibroblasts. It is concluded that these tumours would be better designated polypoid myofibroblastomas in view of the above findings.\r"

Sixty consecutive tumours with oestrogen receptor concentrations of less than 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein, as estimated by dextran-coated charcoal biochemical assay, were examined. Paraffin wax sections were treated with DNAse before applying a peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method using ER-ICA monoclonal antibodies. Fifty one cases (85%) were negative, six (10%) weakly positive, and three (5%) were moderately positive. No strongly positive cases were seen. It is suggested that cases with weakly positive staining, especially when localised to a small area, should be regarded as negative. On the other hand, as the three moderately stained cases included two small tubular carcinomas and an invasive ductal carcinoma with high progesterone receptor concentrations, it is more likely that the biochemical assay in these cases represented false negative results due to sampling error or inclusion of fibrous or other non-neoplastic tissue in the assayed samples. It is concluded that the immunohistological method used here is fairly reliable and would be especially valuable for determination of oestrogen receptor content in small, mammographically detected tumours from which no tissue would be available for biochemical assay or frozen section examination.\r"

Comparison was made with two methods of tube coagulase testing and five slide methods for detecting clumping factor (slide coagulase testing). Performances were assessed for two groups of organisms, staphylococcal species alone and a combined staphylococcal and non-staphylococcal species group. The effects of growth on selective media and storage of isolates at room temperature and 4 degrees C were investigated. Selective media cannot be recommended, nor can storage of isolates before testing. Ranked according to efficiency value with the combined staphylococcal and non-staphylococcal species group, the kits and coagulase methods performed as follows (the figures in parentheses are the efficiency values for the staphylococcal group alone): tube coagulase reference method 100% (100%), tube coagulase SJH method 99% (99%), Staphaurex 94% (97%), Staphylase 93% (96%), slide coagulase method No 4 93% (94%), slide coagulase method No 5 93% (93%), Bacto Latex 92% (95%), Staphyslide 92% (95%), and Biostaph 87% (91%). It is concluded that a commercial S aureus identification kit should not replace tube coagulase testing for the routine identification of the organism from primary plates and that, even the kits with the best performances, have little advantage over a good slide coagulase test method.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty five renal biopsy specimens were used to compare a direct immunofluorescence technique on frozen sections with immunoperoxidase techniques on paraffin wax sections. For the immunoperoxidase techniques, dewaxed sections were treated with protease at 37 degrees C. Sections were examined at intervals on a microscope and digestion was stopped when plasma was removed from glomerular capillary loops. This permitted intense staining of immunoproteins on immunoperoxidase. There was agreement between immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence in the staining for IgG, IgA, and IgM in 50 biopsy specimens and discordant findings did not affect the diagnosis. Immunoperoxidase did not detect C3 in 16 biopsy specimens. Findings with antiserum to another complement component, C9, detected by immunoperoxidase correlated with C3 findings detected by immunofluorescence in 17 biopsy specimens. It is concluded that microscopical observation of the progress of digestion permits optimal staining by immunoperoxidase methods, thus overcoming the problem of variability in proteolytic digestion of sections. Inconsistency in the demonstration of complement deposition can be avoided by staining for C9 rather than C3.\r"

No change in the size of wheal-and-flare reactions to histamine occurred, but the size of wheal reactions to codeine and bradykinin increased in all study subjects after ingesting the ACE inhibitor, captopril. Five of 10 study subjects developed flushing reactions after ACE-inhibitor treatment. We conclude that inhibition of bradykinin metabolism by ACE inhibitors is the probable cause of ACE inhibitor-related angioedema and that substance P is not the predominant mediator in this process.\r"

  ".W": "It was our aim to study the effect of nasal allergen provocation on the concentration of eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) in nasal lavage fluid, with and without glucocorticoid pretreatment. Twenty grass-pollen sensitive volunteers were provoked outside the pollen season on 2 consecutive days after pretreatment for 2 weeks with the glucocorticoid, budesonide, as a nasal spray (400 micrograms/day) and with placebo with a double-blind, crossover design. Nasal lavage fluid was repeatedly collected during a 10-hour period to study both early and late-phase responses. 99mTechnetium-albumin was added to the lavage fluid, making it possible to calculate the amount of secretion and the degree of dilution. The results were as follows: (1) There was no correlation between ECP concentration and dilution factor in the individual samples. (2) The mean concentration of ECP in lavage fluid from untreated, prechallenge noses was 400 micrograms/L. (3) The ECP level did not increase during the early phase response. (4) There was a late occurring increase in the ECP concentration (6 to 24 hours). (5) This increase was completely inhibited by budesonide pretreatment. (6) The glucocorticoid therapy also reduced the prechallenge ECP concentration. In conclusion, allergen provocation in the nose results in a late occurring increase of ECP in nasal lavage fluid, and one of the therapeutic effects of topical glucocorticoid therapy may be an inhibition of the allergen-induced increase of this cytotoxic molecule.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of inflammatory mediators in the pathogenesis of the ocular allergic response, 23 subjects with positive histories of allergies to either cat dander or ragweed pollen and positive skin tests to the appropriate allergen extract were recruited and were subjected to conjunctival provocation. The tear duct of the left eye of each subject was blocked with a collagen plug while the right eye was left unplugged. In all cases, the eye was initially provoked with saline and subsequently with the appropriate allergen extract. Nonallergic subjects, or allergic subjects provoked with nonrelevant allergen, were used as control subjects. After each provocation, symptoms were recorded, and tears were collected with preweighed strips of filter paper (Schirmer strip). Each strip was placed into a tared tube containing fluid appropriate for the optimal preservation of the mediator to be measured. It was therefore possible to calculate the weight of tears collected and to express mediator levels per milliliter of tears. All allergic subjects demonstrated a positive symptomatic response to allergen challenge, whereas the control subjects remained asymptomatic. Blockage of the tear duct did not significantly alter the response. For allergic subjects, the levels of histamine, kinins, prostaglandin D2, albumin, and TAME-esterase activity were all significantly (p less than 0.005 in each case) greater after allergen challenge than after saline challenge. Furthermore, levels of each of these mediators after allergen challenge (expressed as increases above levels after saline provocation) were significantly greater for allergic subjects than for control subjects (p less than 0.005 in each case). Thus, the clinical response to conjunctival provocation with allergen is associated with increases in the levels of inflammatory mediators in tears.\r"

Patients were randomized to receive either thymopentin (Timunox, n = 48) or placebo (n = 52), administered as daily subcutaneous injections for 6 weeks. Clinical extent of disease and severity parameters were measured at baseline and at regular time intervals during the study. Both the placebo- and thymopentin-treated groups demonstrated a progressive and statistically significant (p less than 0.001) decline in the overall severity of their disease, but reduction in the clinical severity score was higher in the thymopentin-treated group and statistically significant (p = 0.04) in comparison with the placebo-treated group after 6 weeks of treatment. Of the individual symptoms comprising the total severity score, pruritis (p = 0.02) and erythema (p = 0.04) were reduced significantly when thymopentin therapy was compared to placebo therapy. In addition, both the extent of body involvement and severity index (a combined severity/extent index) were significantly reduced after 6 weeks in the thymopentin-treated group in comparison to the placebo-treated group (p = 0.04). There were no serious adverse experiences in either treatment group. We conclude that treatment with thymopentin is safe and offers significant therapeutic promise for atopic dermatitis.\r"

The occurrence of avoidable adverse drug reactions is the most serious consequence of inappropriate prescribing; economic implications are also of interest. With increasing concern over the quality of care in nursing homes, and with the revision of regulations governing such care by the Health Care Financing Administration, it is important to consider the experience thus far in monitoring and improving drug use in nursing homes. A number of studies have investigated approaches designed to reduce inappropriate prescribing and drug utilization in this setting. In contrast to the wide range of approaches that have been evaluated and implemented in the hospital setting, interventions in the nursing home have centered primarily around consultant-pharmacist activities. Although these activities are now federally mandated in all nursing homes, there is little evidence from adequately controlled studies to document their impact or cost-effectiveness. By contrast, face-to-face educational interventions directed at physicians (\"academic detailing\") have been shown to be effective in improving prescribing for some medications. The prominent role played by the nursing staff in the utilization of many medications in the nursing home implies that an educational intervention excluding nursing staff would be insufficient to influence drug utilization positively in many situations (eg, psychoactive medications and laxatives). Future research efforts must pay greater attention to adequate study design considerations as well as to the clinical outcomes of such interventions and their cost-effectiveness.\r"

To develop a more precise concept of the clinical efficacy of neuroleptics, a metaanalytic review of the existing literature was performed. From double-blind clinical trials that compared a neuroleptic with a placebo in agitated dementia patients, P values and effect-size estimates were obtained, and were assessed by metaanalytic techniques. Results indicated that neuroleptics were significantly more effective than placebo (one-tailed P = .004) and had a small effect size (r = .18). Clinically, neuroleptic treatment changed the improvement rate in agitated dementia patients from .41 to .59 (binomial effect-size display). This indicates that 18 of 100 dementia patients benefited from neuroleptic treatment (beyond that of placebo) and is consistent with the modest efficacy described in previous qualitative reviews. In six studies comparing thioridazine with another neuroleptic, and in five studies comparing haloperidol with another neuroleptic, metaanalysis results did not show that these two medications differed significantly from the comparison medications, which is not inconsistent with the opinion that no single neuroleptic is better than another.\r"

  ".U": "90237473\r", 
  ".W": "The elicitation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions in mice is due to the sequential action of two different Ag-specific Thy-1+ cells. An early-acting DTH-initiating cell in the lymphoid organs produces a circulating, Ag-specific factor that is functionally analogous to IgE antibody and initiates DTH by sensitizing the local tissue for release of the vasoactive amine serotonin. In picryl chloride (PC1) or oxazolone (OX) contact sensitivity, this DTH-initiating factor is called PC1-F and OX-F respectively, and is Ag-specific, but MHC-unrestricted. The phenotype of polyclonal DTH-initiating cells was recently shown to be unusual for an Ag-specific cell. The phenotype was: Thy-1+, Lyt-1+ (CD5), triple negative (CD4-, CD8-, and CD3-), B220+ (Ly-5, CD45RA), positive for IL-3 receptors, but not IL-2 receptors, and positive for antibodies that react with a putative constant or framework portion of DTH-initiating factors such as anti-PC1-F antibodies and 14-30 mAb. We report here the generation of an Ag-specific DTH-initiating cell clone from nude mice that were immunized and boosted by contact sensitization with OX. By flow microfluorometry analysis, this clone has a similar unique surface phenotype, and by in vivo assay has the same functional abilities, as polyclonal DTH-initiating cells. The clone produces Ag-specific OX-F that acts in an Ag-specific manner to initiate DTH. Moreover, specific cDNA probes and Northern blot analysis of the clone demonstrated that the Ag-specific DTH-initiating cells are Thy-1+, CD3-, and IL-3R+. Thus, DTH initiation is due to an Ag-specific lymphoid cell, that produces an Ag-specific factor, and that has a unique surface phenotype for Ag-specific cells; namely, Thy-1+, CD5+, sIg-, CD4-, CD8-, CD3-, CD45RA+, IL-2R-, and IL-3R+.\r"

To characterize the autoantibody response in IDDM patients, we determined the frequency of circulating B cells committed to the production of IgM, IgG, and IgA to insulin in 12 newly diagnosed IDDM patients and, for comparison, in 9 healthy subjects and 17 insulin-treated IDDM patients. We found that B cells committed to the production of anti-insulin IgG, but not IgM, autoantibodies are present at much higher frequency in the circulation of newly diagnosed IDDM patients before insulin treatment (0.209 +/- 0.142%, mean value +/- SD of total IgG-producing cell precursors) as compared with age-matched healthy controls (0.032 +/- 0.030% of total IgG-producing cell precursors). In IDDM patients who had been treated with insulin, cells producing IgG antibody to insulin were 0.177 +/- 0.139% of total IgG-producing cell precursors. Generation of IgG mAb from B cells of IDDM patients revealed that they were monoreactive, i.e., they bound to insulin, but to none of the other Ag tested, and displayed a high affinity for insulin (Kd approximately 10(-7) moles/liter). In contrast, the IgG mAb derived from healthy subjects were polyreactive, i.e., they bound to all Ag tested, and displayed a low to moderate affinity for insulin (Kd approximately 10(-5) to 10(-6) moles/liter). These findings show that lymphocytes committed to the production of high affinity IgG autoantibodies to insulin are common in the B cell repertoire at the onset of IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "HIV and the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which causes AIDS in macaques, infect only a small percentage of CD4+ lymphocytes at any point during the disease. We have identified three distinct cellular phenotypes within the CD4+ subpopulation in macaques, based on cell surface expression of CD44 and CD45R, which putatively represent successive stages of postthymic proliferation and functional maturation. Two of these subsets, CD44hi CD45R+, which contained virtually all circulating cells in cycle, and CD44hi CD45R-, which was noncycling and has been linked to immunologic memory, were selectively depleted in SIV-infected animals at an asymptomatic stage of disease. To test whether SIV infection was restricted to cells with this phenotype in vivo, we used the polymerase chain reaction to sensitively detect SIV DNA in purified subpopulations of CD4+ lymphocytes. We found that SIV exclusively infected blood lymphocytes expressing high levels of CD44. Within this subset infection occurred not only in the fraction containing actively proliferating cells (CD45R+), but also in resting, putative memory cells (CD45R-). These data directly demonstrate that cellular maturation stages of normal postthymic T lymphocyte differentiation are important factors in permitting lentivirus infection in vivo, and that noncycling, memory T cells may be a reservoir for SIV.\r"

Endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice have a cellular defect in the regulation of TNF production and provide a model in which to examine the relative importance of TNF and IL-1. To assess the relative role of TNF and IL-1, we injected the synthetic bacterial cell wall derivative muramyl dipeptide (MDP) or LPS into C3H/HeJ mice. Both MDP and LPS stimulated hemopoietic growth factor production in a dose-dependent manner. Northern blot analysis of splenic and lung mRNA revealed that MDP treatment induced granulocyte-macrophage CSF and macrophage-CSF transcripts, whereas LPS treatment induced macrophage-CSF transcripts. Messenger RNA for granulocyte-CSF, IL-3, IL-4, and IL-5 was not detected in control or treated mice. MDP treatment induced IL-1 mRNA but not TNF mRNA, and TNF bioactivity was not detected in the serum of MDP-treated mice. In contrast, LPS treatment induced TNF production. These results identify the hemopoietic growth factors induced by MDP and LPS in vivo, and suggest that MDP stimulates growth factor production by a mechanism independent of TNF.\r"

Murine astrocytes secrete granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) as evidenced by induction of colony formation in bone marrow cells and growth of FDC-P1 cells. Both effects are neutralized with anti-GM-CSF- but not with anti-IL-3-antibodies. Some residual activity detected in the bone marrow assay after antibody treatment can be explained by concomitant production of granulocyte CSF (G-CSF). The mRNA of both G- and GM-CSF are identified by Northern blots in astrocytes. Furthermore, mRNA for IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta are detected in comparable amounts in astrocytes and brain macrophages, the latter, however, comprising much more potent sources of TNF-alpha.\r"

Compared with untreated monocytes, rhGM-CSF-treated monocytes promoted enhanced mitogen- and Ag-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. This enhancement was significantly inhibited by mAb to rhGM-CSF. In experiments designed to define the mechanism of rhGM-CSF augmentation of accessory cell function, rhGM-CSF was shown to cause a dose-dependent increase in monocyte expression of surface HLA-DR molecules and stimulated secretion of IL-1, both important in monocyte T cell interactions. Further studies demonstrated that levels of HLA-DR and IL-1 mRNA were increased by rhGM-CSF, indicating transcriptional regulation of gene expression for HLA-DR and IL-1. Thus, rhGM-CSF augments accessory cell function by human monocytes, and this augmentation correlates with rhGM-CSF-induced increases in transcription of the HLA-DR and IL-1 genes leading to increased expression of surface HLA-DR and secretion of IL-1.\r"

CIC detected by the fluid phase Clq binding assay were precipitated from serum using Clq and polyethylene glycol. CIC were also isolated by sequential chromatography with anion exchange and lectin affinity supports. The isolated material was analyzed by PAGE and immunoblotting. The immune complex material isolated by both methods from rats with Heymann nephritis contained the same 60/65-kDa tubular Ag. By immunoblotting, the 60/65-kDa tubular Ag-bound antibodies from rats with active Heymann nephritis, but not antibodies to gp330. Antibody bound to the 60/65-kDa tubular protein in the CIC was isolated. This antibody bound to a similar Ag in glomerular eluates from rats with active Heymann nephritis when tested by immunoblotting. These observations suggest that glomerular immune deposits and CIC in rats with Heymann nephritis contain the same tubular Ag. The 60/65-kDa Ag was isolated from CIC by HPLC using anion exchange and hydrophobic interaction columns. Rats immunized with this Ag developed Heymann nephritis. These studies suggest that CIC contribute to the development of glomerular subepithelial immune deposits in this model of membranous nephropathy. These studies do not exclude the participation of other Ag-antibody systems in Heymann nephritis, including gp330. This report describes methods for isolation and characterization of Ag-antibody components of CIC that might be useful to studies of other immune complex-mediated diseases.\r"

Immunol. 136:2534). We report that C-resistant melanoma cells express a membrane proteinase that can cleave C3b, generating a cleavage product with a molecular mass of approximately 30 kDa. The C3-cleaving proteinase was identified on the melanoma cells by its cross-reaction with antiserum to p57, a C3-cleaving proteinase previously isolated from human E membranes (C. Charriaut-Marlangue, M. Barel, R. Frade. 1986. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 140:1113). Preincubation of the C-resistant melanoma cells with anti-p57 IgG or their F(ab')2 fragments increased their susceptibility to complement killing from 25% to approximately 50% and reduced the rate of C3b cleavage and the amount of the 30-kDa fragment generated on the cells. Anti-p57 IgG stained C-resistant melanoma cells by indirect immunofluorescence and precipitated a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa. This membrane protein, termed p65, was not detectable on C-susceptible melanoma cells. Membrane extracts from C-resistant melanoma cells also showed C3-cleaving activity when incubated with purified C3 or C3b, similarly generating a C3 fragment of approximately 35 kDa. This fluid-phase C3 cleaving activity could be partially inhibited by anti-p57 IgG. These data suggest that p65 is a C3-cleaving proteinase, antigenically related to p57, that is expressed on C-resistant melanoma cells and responsible for the C resistance of these cells. We propose that the membrane-bound C3-cleaving proteinase represents another C regulatory protein protecting host cells against killing by C.\r"

  ".W": "Coculture of blood forms of Trypanosoma cruzi with human PMBC suppresses the expression of several molecules involved in lymphocyte activation, including receptors for IL-2. Our work was initially undertaken to establish whether this effect required physical parasite-PBMC contact or was mediated by a T. cruzi secretion product. Using culture inserts with cell-impermeable membranes, we were able to demonstrate significant suppression of PHA-induced lymphoproliferation whether the trypanosomes were placed in the same compartment as, or separated from, the PBMC. Similar effects were observed by using supernatants from T. cruzi suspensions. These supernatants, which we refer to as trypanosomal immunosuppressive factor, also inhibited IL-2R expression in response to PHA stimulation. The suppressive effect of the secretion product(s) of T. cruzi was reversible, as evidenced by significant recovery of the proliferative capacity of PBMC after removal of the parasite-containing inserts. Moreover, the extent of the suppression produced by trypanosomal immunosuppressive factor subsided as culture time increased. Treatment of trypanosomal immunosuppressive factor with proteases abrogated its suppressive activity, suggesting that the relevant principle(s) was of protein nature. From ultrafiltration experiments, the molecular mass of the suppressive molecule(s) was estimated to be between 30,000 and 100,000 Da. These results demonstrate for the first time the capacity of T. cruzi to spontaneously secrete a factor that suppresses human lymphocyte responses in vitro. This factor, which may play a role in the down-regulation of host immune function observed in acute chagasic patients, might be a useful tool in exploring the mechanisms that regulate the expression of IL-2R and other surface molecules playing key roles in lymphocyte activation.\r"

  ".U": "90237522\r", 
  ".W": "Starch-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages were able to kill schistosomula in vitro in the presence of a variety of immune sera. Dose response experiments revealed the superior \"quality\" of serum from mice vaccinated four times with highly irradiated cercariae (4xVMS) in mediating killing at titers comparable to the other sera tested. B3A, a partially protective mAb (IgG3) that recognizes a Mr 16,000 schistosomular surface Ag, mediated higher levels of killing than any of the sera at comparable titers. In contrast, H12, a partially protective mAb (IgG2a; anti-Mr 32,000), and C1C9, a nonprotective McAb (IgG3; anti-Mr 38,000) failed to mediate killing. Two anti-Mac-1 alpha-chain mAb (5C6 and M1/70) mediated substantial dose-dependent blocking of 4xVMS and B3A-mediated macrophage killing. In contrast, a mAb to the Mac-1-associated beta-chain was less effective, whereas the mAb F4/80 did not significantly block killing despite being present on this macrophage population. Although whole 5C6 Ig was the most efficient at inhibiting B3A-mediated killing, 5C6 Fab fragments were still effective at concentrations as low as 0.5 microgram/ml (10 nM). On a molar basis 5C6 appeared to be more effective at blocking 4xVMS-mediated killing than M1/70, while only M1/70 was capable of inhibiting macrophage adherence to schistosomula. These findings, together with the observation that anti-alpha chain mAb were far more effective at blocking killing than the anti-beta-chain mAb, rules out the possibility that 5C6 is nonspecifically inhibiting B3A-FcR interaction. The data also imply a functional relationship between Mac-1 and FcRIII, the receptor for B3A, in macrophage killing.\r"

  ".U": "90237829\r", 
  ".W": "High-dose administration of anticancer agents is attractive both on theoretic and clinical grounds. Yet, high-dose regimens are usually used as salvage treatments, mainly as a consequence of their considerable hematologic toxicity. One pertinent example is represented by cyclophosphamide, an alkylating agent with a wide spectrum of marked antitumor activity. When used at doses up to 7 g/m2 (190 to 200 mg/kg) this drug does not cause myeloablation, but induces a severe, albeit transient, myelosuppression, which requires platelet transfusions in approximately 50% of treated patients, and is frequently complicated by infectious episodes, occasionally lethal. To accelerate hematopoietic recovery, we continuously infused for 14 consecutive days 5.5 micrograms/kg/d of the glycosylated human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) into 15 patients with breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with 7 g/m2 cyclophosphamide. This schedule was chosen having obtained the fastest hematopoietic recovery among four different options during an initial schedule-finding phase on 12 overall patients. Twenty-one comparable subjects with solid tumors served as controls. We report here that this relatively low, well-tolerated dose of rhGM-CSF reduces from 20 to 14 (median) and from 24 to 14, the number of days required to recover circulating granulocyte counts over 1,000 and 2,500/microL, respectively. The stimulatory effect was associated with a remarkable clinical benefit. In fact, treated patients experienced less infectious complications (7% v 24%) were eligible to receive chemotherapy earlier (median, by day +14 v day +20 for controls), and fewer required prophylactic platelet transfusions (13% v 43%). Our results show that even very high doses of cyclophosphamide can be administered with improved hematologic toxicity, tolerable morbidity, and reduced supportive care requirements. The increase in the therapeutic index made possible by rhGM-CSF infusion prompts the use of high-dose cyclophosphamide, and possibly of other agents with similar myelotoxic activity, early in the clinical course of chemotherapy-sensitive tumors.\r"

CNS treatment before the conditioning regimen consisted of cranial irradiation at 15 Gy (n = 8) and intrathecal chemotherapy (n = 9). The conditioning regimen included cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) in a single dose. No postgraft CNS prophylaxis was administered. At the present time, seven patients are alive and disease-free at 18, 23, 44, 47, 54, 54, and 59 months. Two patients died at 14 and 7 months from transfusion-related acquired immune deficiency syndrome and bacterial septicemia and were disease-free at the time of their death.

The French-American-British (FAB) classification was retained for diagnosing AML, with the addition of patients with bone marrow morphologic features of a myelodysplastic syndrome and less than 30% bone marrow blasts, but with greater than or equal to 30% blasts in the peripheral blood. In this report, there are four important subgroups of AML not defined in the FAB classification that are discussed: undifferentiated acute leukemia, MO (AML lacking definitive myeloid differentiation by morphology or conventional cytochemistry but with ultrastructural or immunophenotypic evidence for AML), mixed lineage leukemia, and hypocellular AML. Definitions of response for clinical trials are presented to facilitate comparisons among different studies. Complete remission is considered the only response worth reporting in phase III trials, since lesser responses do not improve survival. Partial remissions may be of interest to identify active new agents in phase I and II studies. Monoclonal antibodies and cytogenetic studies are not part of the routine assessment of remission or reassessment at relapse, and their role in the evaluation of patients with AML is currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Although we recognize that some of the definitions in this report are arbitrary, generalized use of these guidelines will make results of clinical trials more comparable and interpretable.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cancer, the Head and Neck Contracts Program conducted a three-arm study comparing standard surgery and radiation, induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and bleomycin) plus standard therapy, and induction chemotherapy plus standard therapy followed by maintenance cisplatin for 6 months. As previously reported, this trial of 462 patients demonstrated no significant difference in disease-free survival or survival, but a significantly lower metastatic rate in the maintenance arm. To determine whether particular subgroups may have benefited from adjuvant therapy, we evaluated results based on primary site, and tumor (T) and node (N) stage. Of the 192 patients with oral cavity cancer, those on the maintenance arm had a significantly improved 3-year disease-free survival (67%) compared with the standard arm (49%) or induction arm (44%) (overall P = .05). For hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers there was no marked overall benefit. For the 106 patients with T1 plus T2 disease, there was marginal improvement in disease-free survival for the maintenance group (72%) compared with the standard group (47%) or induction group (43%) (overall P = .09). There was no advantage for patients with T3 and T4 disease. There was superior disease-free survival for patients with N1 disease on the maintenance arm (70%) compared with the standard arm (42%) (P = .024). The same was true for disease-free survival in 109 patients with N2 disease: standard (52%), induction (30%), maintenance (84%) (overall P less than .001). There was no benefit for N3 disease. A significant survival advantage with maintenance chemotherapy was only seen for N2 disease (overall P = .04). Since head and neck cancer patients are a heterogeneous group, there may be particular sites and stages for which adjuvant chemotherapy would be advantageous, and subset analysis can help indicate directions for new trials.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen deprivation by aromatase inhibition is an effective treatment in breast cancer. Between October 1986 and March 1988, 91 postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer entered a phase II study performed jointly in three center to investigate the new aromatase inhibitor 4-hydroxyandrostenedione. Patients received 500 mg 4-hydroxyandrostenedione intramuscularly (IM) every 2 weeks for 6 weeks, and 250 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. There were two complete (CRs) and 19 partial remissions (PRs) (response rate, 23%). Disease stabilization (no change; NC) was seen in 26 patients, and in 44 patients (48%), disease progression occurred. Duration of the CRs is 20+ months, median durations of PR and NC are 13+ and 8 months, respectively. Receptor status, relapse-free interval, and sites of metastatic lesions did not appear to influence treatment results. However, efficacy of previous tamoxifen treatment favorably predicted response to 4-hydroxyandrostenedione. Serum estradiol levels decreased significantly in patients after 2 weeks of treatment. Side effects were mostly nonspecific and of low degree, requiring discontinuation of treatment in only 3% of the patients. We conclude that aromatase inhibition with 4-hydroxyandrostenedione is efficacious in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), good performance status, and no prior chemotherapy were randomized to receive one of three regimens: intravenous vindesine (V) 3 mg/m2 every 2 weeks; V 3 mg/m2 weekly for 5 weeks, followed by a dose every 2 weeks plus mitomycin (VM) 20 mg/m2 day 1 and then 15 mg/m2 every 6 weeks; or V at the more intensive dose rate plus cisplatin (VC) 120 mg/m2 with forced diuresis on days 1 and 29 and then every 6 weeks. A total of 435 patients were enrolled in the trial, with 410 (94%) assessable for prognostic characteristics and survival. Among the 375 patients assessable for response, only 58 (15%) achieved objective response. Single-agent V every 2 weeks was inactive (response rate less than 1%), effectively acting as a no-treatment arm. Among assessable patients receiving VM, 33 (27%) responded; among patients receiving VC, 24 (19%) responded. There was no statistically significant survival difference among the treatment arms, with median survival among those treated with V 14.8 weeks, VM 20.4 weeks, and VC 24.7 weeks; VC achieved borderline significance (P = .06) compared with V. In a prognostic factor analysis, treatment was not a significant factor (P = .447) for survival. Thus, in this large multicenter trial, neither a high-dose cisplatin combination nor a noncisplatin regimen (VM) with a comparable response rate had a significant survival advantage over minimal chemotherapy. New approaches are needed in advanced NSCLC.\r"

Two courses of cisplatin, VP-16, and vincristine chemotherapy were given with concurrent radiotherapy (XRT) to the primary tumor to a total dose of 4,500 cGy. Elective brain XRT was given to all patients concurrent with a third course of cisplatin/VP-16 therapy. Consolidation chemotherapy consisting of vincristine, methotrexate, and VP-16 alternating with Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) and cyclophosphamide, was given for 12 weeks following the initial induction chemotherapy/XRT program. Patients with a complete response had all therapy discontinued. Among 154 eligible patients treated, the complete response rate was 56%, with a partial response rate of 27%. The median survival is 17.5 months with an estimated 30% survival rate at 4 years from initiation of treatment. Combined modality toxicities were acceptable with the predominant toxicity being moderate to severe leukopenia and mild radiation esophagitis. The results of this treatment program appear superior to any previously reported by our group and compare favorably to those in the literature at large.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two previously untreated, fit patients with small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) were treated with an intensive combination chemotherapy regimen, with the aim of prolonging survival, as follows: carboplatin 400 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) day 1, ifosfamide 5 g/m2 IV day 1 in a 24-hour infusion with mesna, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 IV days 1 to 3, repeating at 28-day intervals for six courses. Limited-disease (LD) patients were given concurrent hyperfractionated radiotherapy for the first two courses, and all patients achieving a complete remission (CR) were offered prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). For 18 LD patients, the overall response was 94% with 72% CRs. For 14 extensive-disease (ED) patients the overall response was 100% with 29% CRs. Median response duration for LD patients was 11.5 months and for ED patients 7.5 months. Median survival for LD patients was 19 months with a predicted 24% 2-year survival and for ED patients 9.5 months with a predicted 14% 2-year survival. Hematologic toxicity was severe with 100% developing World Health Organization (WHO) grade 3-4 neutropenia and 94% WHO grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia during treatment. Seventy-two percent of patients required a dose reduction at some stage during treatment because of neutropenic infection or thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions. Despite very high response rates, this intensive regimen achieves survival results only modestly better, if at all, than those reported for less toxic conventional regimens.\r"

Clinical trials have focused on increasing complete response (CR) and survival rates; in addition, improved quality of life by decreasing the use of conventional surgical procedures is being pursued. Both of these goals may have been achieved for some tumors, most notably for anal cell carcinoma. Improved survival with concomitant chemoradiotherapy has also been shown for patients treated on randomized studies for pancreatic, colorectal, small-cell lung, head and neck, and cervical cancer. These results call for the continued investigation of this approach in the laboratory and in the clinic.\r"

  ".W": "A major obstacle to investigations of Hodgkin's disease is the paucity of malignant cells, i.e., Reed-Sternberg cells and their variants, in tissues of patients with this disease. Consequently, the pathogenesis, cell of origin, and clonality of this relatively frequent lymphoma have remained unresolved. Results of recent studies suggest that in some instances Reed-Sternberg cells carry rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain joining region (JH) loci as well as chromosomal translocations involving band 14q32. Prompted by these findings, we sought to determine if the t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation of follicular, non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma was associated with Hodgkin's disease. To detect the possible t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation within the rare malignant cells of Hodgkin's disease, we amplified sequences created by the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). With this approach, DNA sequences carrying the direct fusion of the major breakpoint region of the candidate oncogene, bcl-2, derived from chromosome 18q21, with JH on chromosome 14q32 can be detected in as few as one in 10(5)-10(6) cells. In the present study, joined bcl-2/JH sequences were detected in tissues involved by Hodgkin's disease in 17 of 53 (32%) patients. The frequent association of bcl-2 translocation with Hodgkin's disease suggests that this oncogene has a role in the pathogenesis of Hodgkin's disease. That bcl-2 is involved in a major class of lymphoma in addition to follicular lymphoma implies a role for additional factors responsible for generating the two distinctive clinical and pathologic disease states.\r"

Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine has spread to most areas with malaria. Alternative drugs to chloroquine are either associated with adverse reactions, are of limited efficacy, or require complex and detailed instructions for use that reduce compliance. These factors have contributed to a threefold increase in the number of reported P. falciparum infections among U.S. travelers to malarious areas since 1980. A new drug, mefloquine (Lariam), is expected to be highly effective against both chloroquine-resistant and Fansidar-resistant P. falciparum infections. Mefloquine is now recommended as the drug of choice for travelers at risk of infection with chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum. Alternative drugs for travelers who cannot take mefloquine include 1) doxycycline alone or 2) chloroquine alone, with Fansidar available for standby treatment while medical care is sought for evaluation of febrile illness when travelers are in a malarious area. Prospective travelers and health-care providers are advised to call the CDC Malaria Hotline at (404) 332-4555 for detailed recommendations for the prevention of malaria.\r"

The major areas for future development are (1) the control of acute and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, (2) the palliation of malignant gastrointestinal neoplasms, and (3) the management of benign and malignant obstructive lesions of the biliary tract. Refinements in laser devices, delivery systems, and techniques such as photodynamic therapy will be needed to achieve more selective tissue destruction. Improvements in the new adjunctive endoscopic methods of electronic (video) endoscopy and ultrasonography may enhance evolving laser applications by more accurately identifying diseased tissues and guiding their destruction.\r"

Physical examination--including cardiac auscultation and determining the status of the peripheral vasculature--is important as a guide to immediate management and as a baseline for future comparison. The differential diagnosis of AMI is extensive, and various laboratory tests, such as electrocardiography, cardiac enzymes, radionuclide techniques, echocardiography, and cardiac catheterization, can aid in the diagnosis. The routine management of patients with AMI can include medical therapy with antithrombotic agents, nitrates, beta-adrenergic blockers, or calcium channel blocking agents. The major differences between Q-wave and non-Q-wave infarction are discussed. Some factors that affect early and late prognosis in patients with AMI are age of the patient, residual left ventricular function, residual myocardial ischemia, and substrates for sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Although much of the current enthusiasm in management of AMI is related to revascularization strategies, other important aspects of diagnosis and treatment should not be overlooked.\r"

This growth is the result of improvements in existing technology, development of new technology, and expansion of criteria for the selection of patients. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains the mainstay and is used to treat an increasing number of patients with coronary artery disease that manifests as stable or unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. Atherectomy is being used to \"debulk\" lesions and remove atheromatous plaque as well as to remove intimal flaps after PTCA. The insertion of an intracoronary stent is a strategy designed to treat intimal dissections and acute closure as well as to attempt to decrease the incidence of restenosis. Finally, intracoronary laser therapy--independently or in combination with PTCA--is being evaluated as a treatment approach for more diffuse disease, acute occlusion, and prevention of restenosis.\r"

  ".W": "Pain is a common problem in the early postoperative period. Techniques that provide perioperative analgesia to alleviate pain may have a significant effect on postoperative events, such as earlier ambulation and earlier dismissal from the hospital with use of epidural analgesia than with systemic analgesia. Spinal opioids, which can be administered epidurally or intrathecally, provide analgesia that is superior to that achieved with systemically administered narcotics. For procedures on the upper extremities, selective analgesia can be achieved with use of various types of neural blockade--for example, brachial plexus blockade, interscalene blockade, and axillary plexus blockade. Intercostal nerve block, a valuable but underutilized procedure appropriate for unilateral upper abdominal or flank operations or for thoracotomy, has been shown to reduce postoperative narcotic requirements and pulmonary complications. A patient-controlled analgesia device, consisting of an electronically controlled infusion pump with a timing device that can be triggered by the patient for intravenous administration of a narcotic when pain is experienced, avoids the vast fluctuations in analgesia that accompany parenteral administration of drugs. In most patients, postoperative pain can be prevented or diminished, and clinicians should be aware of the available techniques for achieving this goal.\r"

  ".W": "Chloroquine is thought to act against falciparum malaria by accumulating in the acid vesicles of the parasite and interfering with their function. Parasites resistant to chloroquine expel the drug rapidly in an unaltered form, thereby reducing levels of accumulation in the vesicles. The discovery that verapamil partially reverses chloroquine resistance in vitro led to the proposal that efflux may involve an ATP-driven P-glycoprotein pump similar to that in mammalian multidrug-resistant (mdr) tumor cell lines. Indeed, Plasmodium falciparum contains at least two mdr-like genes, one of which has been suggested to confer the chloroquine resistant (CQR) phenotype. To determine if either of these genes is linked to chloroquine resistance, we performed a genetic cross between CQR and chloroquine-susceptible (CQS) clones of P. falciparum. Examination of 16 independent recombinant progeny indicated that the rapid efflux phenotype is controlled by a single gene or a closely linked group of genes. But, there was no linkage between the rapid efflux, CQR phenotype and either of the mdr-like P. falciparum genes or amplification of those genes. These data indicate that the genetic locus governing chloroquine efflux and resistance is independent of the known mdr-like genes.\r"

  ".U": "90238546\r", 
  ".W": "The lethal form of human malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum is virtually uncontrollable in many areas because of the development of drug resistance, in particular chloroquine resistance (CQR). CQR is biologically similar to the multiple drug resistance phenotype (MDR) of mammalian tumour cells, as both involve expulsion of drug from the cell and both can be reversed by calcium channel antagonists. A homologue (pfmdr1) of the mammalian multidrug resistance gene has been implicated in CQR because it is amplified in some CQR isolates of P. falciparum as is an mdr gene in MDR tumour cells. We show here that the complete sequences of pfmdr1 genes from 2 CQ sensitive (CQS) P. falciparum isolates are identical. In 5 CQR isolates, 1-4 key nucleotide differences resulted in amino acid substitutions. On the basis of these substitutions, we have correctly predicted the CQS/CQR status of a further 34 out of 36 isolates. This is a paradox as CQR arises much less frequently than would be predicted if single point mutations were sufficient. We conclude that a mutated pfmdr1 gene is one of at least two mutated genes required for CQR.\r"

  ".W": "Recent evidence suggests that the force for poleward movement of chromosomes during mitosis is generated at or close to the kinetochores. Chromosome movement depends on motion relative to microtubules, but the identities of the motors remain uncertain. One candidate for a mitotic motor is dynein, a large multimeric enzyme which can move along microtubules toward their slow growing end. Dyneins were originally found in axonemes of cilia and flagella where they power microtubule sliding. Recently, cytoplasmic dyneins have also been found, and specific antibodies have been raised against them. The cellular localization of dynein has previously been studied with several antibodies raised against flagellar dynein, but the relevance of these data to the distribution of cytoplasmic dynein is not known. Antibodies raised against cytoplasmic dyneins have shown localization of dynein antigens to the mitotic spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos (Lye et al., personal communication) and punctate cytoplasmic structures in Dictyostelium amoebae. Using antibodies that recognize subunits of cytoplasmic dyneins, we show here that during mitosis, cytoplasmic dynein antigens concentrate near the kinetochores, centrosomes and spindle fibres of HeLa and PtK1 cells, whereas at interphase they are distributed throughout the cytoplasm. This is consistent with the hypothesis that cytoplasmic dynein is a mitotic motor.\r"

  ".W": "The removal of introns from messenger RNA precursors requires five small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), contained within ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), which complex with the pre-mRNA and other associated factors to form the spliceosome. In both yeast and mammals, the U2 snRNA base pairs with sequences surrounding the site of lariat formation. Binding of U2 snRNP to the highly degenerate branchpoint sequence in mammalian introns is absolutely dependent on an auxiliary protein, U2AF, which recognizes a polypyrimidine stretch adjacent to the 3' splice site. The absence of this sequence motif in yeast introns has strengthened arguments that the two systems are fundamentally different. Deletion analyses of the yeast U2 gene have confirmed that the highly conserved 5' domain is essential, although the adjacent approximately 950 nucleotides can be deleted without any phenotypic consequence. A 3'-terminal domain of approximately 100 nucleotides is also required for wild-type growth rates; the highly conserved terminal loop within this domain (loop IV) may provide specific binding contacts for two U2-specific snRNP proteins. We have replaced the single copy yeast U2 (yU2) gene with human U2 (hU2), expecting that weak or no complementation would provide an assay for cloning additional splicing factors, such as U2AF. We report here that hU2 can complement the yeast deletion with surprising efficiency. The interactions governing spliceosome assembly and intron recognition are thus more conserved than previously suspected. Paradoxically, the conserved loop IV sequence is dispensable in yeast.\r"

  ".U": "90238727\r", 
  ".W": "Benzodiazepines are the most potent drugs used in the management of status epilepticus (SE). A number of presynaptic, postsynaptic, and nonsynaptic actions of benzodiazepines have been described. However, only the benzodiazepines' enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition and their reduction of repetitive firing occur at concentrations of unbound drug comparable to those that block absence seizures or stop clinical SE in patients. Thus, it is likely that these actions contribute to antiepileptic and anti-SE efficacy of the benzodiazepines. A predictable sequence of progressive electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during the course of generalized convulsive SE, both in humans and in experimental models, has been recently described. The homology of the sequence of EEG patterns in patients and in experimental models supports the concept that animal models should be useful in evaluating the treatment of clinical SE, and benzodiazepines are effective in stopping SE in a number of animal models. Late SE in animals, however, as in humans, is less responsive to treatment than is early SE. Forty-seven clinical studies in which clonazepam, diazepam, or lorazepam was used in the treatment of SE have been reported. Overall, lasting control of SE was achieved in 79% of the 1,346 patients in these noncontrolled studies. However, no data yet exist to differentiate the efficacy of 1 of the benzodiazepines from that of the others. Therefore, the choice of benzodiazepine is best determined by availability and by pharmacokinetic differences. Because of a much smaller volume of distribution of unbound drug, lorazepam appears to have a significantly longer effective duration of action against SE than does diazepam, which is rapidly redistributed to lipid stores in the body after intravenous administration. For this reason, we now use lorazepam in the initial treatment of patients with generalized convulsive SE.\r"

The greatest number of cases will occur in children, although the risk is equally high in the over-60 population. In patients with epilepsy, SE is more likely to occur in those with partial seizures and in those with remote symptomatic epilepsy. The presence of a preexisting neurologic abnormality is associated with an increased risk of SE in those with acute systemic insults. There is a high mortality reported, but this is related predominantly to the underlying condition. The 1 to 2% mortality attributed to SE probably reflects an overestimation of the risk. There is an increased risk of seizures and of intellectual dysfunction following the occurrence of an episode of SE, although the causal association is not clear. Individuals with epilepsy who experience an episode of SE probably have a lower likelihood of remission of epilepsy.\r"

Extensive damage may be encountered in the interorbital area because of the fragility of the bony framework. The medial orbital walls, ethmoid sinuses, and cribriform area of the anterior cranial fossa can resist a maximum compressive force of only 30 g. NOE injuries are usually the result of either a direct blow sustained during an altercation or of a high-velocity motor vehicle accident. Quite often multiple systemic injuries serve to complicate treatment. NOE fractures present the surgeon with numerous challenges during repair. The delicate bony architecture, anatomic framework, and cosmetic expectations indicate comprehensive, thorough treatment. Damage to the eye, which is basically an extension of the brain, is of major concern. Pupillary discrepancies, retrobulbar hematoma, and damage to the optic nerve must be ruled out. Early surgical management is indicated because delayed repair or inadequate treatment prediposes the patient to defects that may be extremely difficult if not impossible to correct with secondary procedures. Numerous articles have been published describing the NOE injury. The multifaceted array of fractures seen in NOE injuries has been formulated into a comprehensive classification by Gruss.\r"

The distribution of plaque and gingivitis has little or no correlation with the distribution of pathologic alveolar bone loss or with periodontitis. The assumption that a distance from cementoenamel junction to alveolar crest (CEJ-AC distance) greater than 2 mm equates with disease overlooks the interrelationship between the CEJ-AC distance and continuous eruption in compensation for tooth wear and growth of the lower face height. Anatomic, physiologic, and pathologic factors increasing CEJ-AC distances are reviewed. Where horizontal periodontitis does result from gingivitis, it is usually of minimal significance and probably occurs when the host defenses have been diminished by environmental factors commonly associated with other chronic diseases. A pulpal-alveolar explanation for localized angular alveolar lesions better fits the clinical features of this form of periodontal bone loss than does the conventional hypothesis of primary periodontal infection by specific oral bacteria.\r"

In the peripheral blood lymphocytes, there was a significant reduction in T cells and suppressor T cells. T lymphocytes and mostly helper T cells were predominant around the ducts and within the lymphocytic infiltrates in the minor SG biopsy samples of patients with SS.

  ".W": "We report a detailed study on oral lesions and their association with the WHO revised provisional case definition of AIDS as well as serologic signs of HIV infection among 186 patients in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania. The patient material consisted of 39 hospitalized suspected AIDS patients, 44 medical nonsuspected patients, 53 dental outpatients, and 50 patients with sexually transmitted diseases. The male:female ratio was 2.1:1 on average. Oral examination was done without knowledge of the HIV status of the patients. Among 39 suspected AIDS patients 97% had WHO AIDS criteria and 90% were seropositive for HIV. Among the 147 patients not suspected of having AIDS 18 (12%) had AIDS criteria and 15% had serologic evidence of HIV infection. The presence of WHO AIDS criteria correlated significantly with the presence of HIV antibodies, but not with HIV antigen. Oral lesions were found in 54% of those with AIDS criteria and 52% of HIV-infected patients, as compared to 3% and 6% of the patients without AIDS criteria and HIV infection, respectively (p less than 0.01). Among patients with AIDS atrophic candidiasis occurred in 21%, pseudomembranous candidiasis in 23%, hairy leukoplakia in 36%, herpetic stomatitis in 2%, Kaposi's sarcoma in 4%, and nonspecific ulcer in 4%. The presence of oral lesions had a high predictive value for presence of AIDS criteria as well as for presence of HIV infection in this hospital setting. All patients should have a thorough oral examination and the presence of the aforementioned oral lesions should lead to testing for HIV infection.\r"

The disease was first noted at the age of 2 years, yet no diagnosis was made. Clinical, histopathologic, and immunologic criteria served to confirm the diagnosis. A review of the literature has revealed 22 well-documented cases of pemphigus vulgaris in children under the age of 17 years. It is concluded that although oral pemphigus vulgaris is rare in young persons, it must be included in the differential diagnosis in those cases that have a prolonged history of erosive or bullous lesions.\r"

  ".W": "In a previous study by our group with patients having asymptomatic teeth with pulpal necrosis and an associated periapical radiolucent lesion (PN/PL), it was shown that prophylactic administration of penicillin V or erythromycin (high-dose, 1-day regimen) resulted in a low incidence of flare-up (mean = 2.2%) and a low incidence of swelling and pain not associated with flare-up. No hypersensitivity responses occurred, and gastrointestinal side effects were found primarily with the erythromycins. To ascertain whether a single-dose administration of a long-acting 1-gm tablet of the cephalosporin antibiotic cefadroxil would result in a similar outcome, the present study was undertaken with 200 patients having quiescent PN/PL. The patients were randomly given either cefadroxil or erythromycin (base or stearate). Evaluations of flare-up were done 1 day, 1 week, and 2 months after endodontic treatment. A 2.0% flare-up incidence was found, with no statistically significant differences for cefadroxil (1.0%), stearate (2.0%), or base (4.0%). No hypersensitivity responses occurred. Gastrointestinal side effects were found primarily with the erythromycins (19.0%). The results showed that a 1-gm, single-dose regimen of cefadroxil was as effective as erythromycin and penicillin in preventing flare-ups and serious sequelae. A comparative analysis of the data from our first study (no peritreatment antibiotics) and the pooled data from our last three investigations (including the current trial) showed that peritreatment antibiotic coverage significantly reduced flare-ups and serious sequelae after endodontic treatment of asymptomatic PN/PL (p less than 0.001).\r"

The teeth were functioning for at least 3 years, without having received any other type of dental work since then. I evaluated the existence of vertical root fracture, the function of the teeth, the type of root canal therapy, the type and length of the post, and the type of retention of the post used in all 460 teeth. After statistical evaluation of the results, I found that 3.69% of the teeth had had vertical root fracture. Computer analysis, simple correlation hypothesis, and distribution method with 1 degree of freedom revealed significant correlation between vertical root fracture and the technique of instrumentation and obturation of the canal (p = 0.025), the length of the post (p = 0.05), and the existence of the post (p = 0.05). On the contrary, I found no correlation between root fracture and type of retention of the prefabricated post used with respect to the method of obturation.\r"

Digital subtraction radiography may provide a noninvasive alternative. Ten patients with bony lesions were operated on and nine of the iatrogenic defects were filled with granulated HA. In one patient, the defect was left unfilled for reference. Customized film holders provided standardized radiography. Follow-up images after 4 to 6 months were subtracted from immediately obtained postoperative images, and changes around the implants were noted. From ten pairs of radiographs, eight could be successfully subtracted, whereas two pairs required corrective image transformation before subtraction. Although no bone loss was observed in any of the patients, the implants did not appear to enhance physiologic bone regeneration either. Hence, subtraction radiography holds the potential of clinical utility for the follow-up of HA implants. However, technical improvements are necessary to yield quantitative data.\r"

A 3.6-kilobase merosin cDNA clone was isolated from a placental cDNA expression library. The clone contained a 3.4-kilobase open reading frame, the 3' portion of which includes protein sequences of proteolytic fragments of merosin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the merosin polypeptide was similar to that of the COOH-terminal region of the 400-kDa A chain of laminin. This part of laminin forms the large globule at the end of the long arm of the laminin cross and is thought to contain the neurite-promoting site and the major cell binding site(s) in laminin. The sequence identity between merosin and the laminin A chain in this region is nearly 40%. An antiserum against a synthetic peptide from the middle of the merosin cDNA sequence identified a 300-kDa polypeptide in placental extracts, indicating that the merosin polypeptide is similar in size to the laminin A chain. Intact merosin was isolated from placental extracts and shown to be covalently associated with the laminin B chains and to have a cross-like structure similar to that of laminin. The similarities between merosin and laminin show that both proteins are members of the same family of basement membrane proteins.\r"

After fractionation, the activity required at least five components, two heat-labile protein fractions and several low molecular weight fractions. One protein fraction, suggested to represent the actual ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase was purified extensively and on denaturing gel electrophoresis gave rise to several defined protein bands, all of which were stained by a polyclonal antibody against one of the two subunits (protein B1) of the aerobic reductase but not by monoclonal anti-B1 antibodies. Peptide mapping and sequence analyses revealed partly common structures between two types of protein bands but also suggested the presence of an additional component. Obviously, the preparations are heterogeneous and the structure of the reductase is not yet established. The second, crude protein fraction is believed to contain several ancillary enzymes required for the reaction. One of the low molecular weight components is S-adenosylmethionine; a second component is a loosely bound metal. We propose that S-adenosylmethionine together with a metal participates in the generation of the radical required for the reduction of carbon 2' of the ribosyl moiety of CTP.\r"

To further analyze the transcriptional component of this hormonal effect, transient transfections of lens cells were prepared with DNA constructs containing deletions of the delta 1-crystallin promoter and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene. A 77-nucleotide DNA segment of the delta 1-crystallin promoter from nucleotide positions-120 to -43 confers sensitivity to insulin and IGF-I. The hormonal effect is dose-dependent, and maximal stimulation of promoter activity (2- to 2.5-fold induction) is obtained with 10(-8) M IGF-I and 10(-7) M insulin. Mobility-shift DNA-binding analysis shows specific binding of nuclear protein(s) to the delta 1-crystallin promoter DNA between positions -120 and +23, which appears to be regulated by IGF-I. An SP1-binding motif is involved in this DNA-protein interaction. The bivalent IgG fraction of an anti-insulin receptor antiserum (B-10), known to mimic insulin action in other systems, stimulates promoter activity to the same extent as insulin.\r"

These anti-IgE antibodies may be largely responsible for the long-term inhibition of synthesis of IgE that is known to result from a perinatal challenge with IgE. This conclusion is supported by the effect of passive inoculation of syngeneic polyclonal anti-IgE antibodies into young mice, which similarly results in selective inhibition of IgE synthesis. Further evidence is the close relationship between the age dependency of IgE-induced inhibition of subsequent IgE synthesis and the ability of IgE to induce anti-IgE antibodies. IgE synthesis was monitored at the level of secretion by B cells as well as serum IgE levels and IgE antibody responses.\r"

A binding assay based on the use of beta-galactosidase fusion proteins was subsequently used to isolate recombinant clones of human cDNAs that encoded apurinic DNA-binding proteins. Two distinct human cDNAs were identified that encoded proteins that bound apurinic DNA preferentially over undamaged, methylated, or UV-irradiated DNA. These approaches may offer a general method for the detection of proteins that recognize various types of DNA damage and for the cloning of genes encoding such proteins.\r"

The gene is widely used as a selectable marker in the transformation of organisms as diverse as bacteria, yeast, plants, and animals. We found a mutation that involves a glutamic to aspartic acid conversion at residue 182 in the protein encoded by the chimeric neomycin phosphotransferase II genes of several commonly used transformation vectors. The mutation substantially reduces phosphotransferase activity but does not appear to affect the stability of the neomycin phosphotransferase II mRNA or protein. Plants and bacteria transformed with the mutant gene are less resistant to antibiotics than those transformed with the normal gene. A simple restriction endonuclease digestion distinguishes between the mutant and the normal gene.\r"

In cells cultured from the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, the QA analog alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA; 10 microM) produced a slow increase in [Ca2+]i that was modest in amplitude (approximately 200 nM). These effects were completely abolished by 10 microM 6-nitro-7-cyano-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX). In cerebellar astrocytes, similar effects were produced by QA. However, in cortical and hippocampal astrocytes, the response to QA was much more complex. In these cells, QA produced an initial [Ca2+]i spike that was followed by a sustained influx of Ca2+ (\"plateau\"). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, this plateau was abolished but the spike remained. CNQX did not block the spike and only slightly reduced the size of the plateau in some cells. Ni2+ (10 microM) but not nimodipine (10 microM) reduced the amplitude of the plateau. Pretreatment with 100 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 15 min abolished the spike but not the plateau portion of the QA response. Treatment with pertussis toxin at 250 ng/ml for 12-16 hr failed to alter the response. In some instances, the latency of the QA response differed considerably for individual cells in a group. It appeared that the response began in one cell and then spread to neighboring cells. Thus, QA appears to trigger a complex response in some astrocytes consisting of Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and also Ca2+ influx resulting from the activation of AMPA-sensitive and -insensitive pathways.\r"

Here we report that the promoters for chloroplast GS2 and cytosolic GS3A of Pisum sativum confer nonoverlapping, cell-specific expression patterns on the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in transgenic tobacco. The promoter for chloroplast GS2 directs GUS expression within photosynthetic cell types (e.g., palisade parenchymal cells of the leaf blade, chlorenchymal cells of the midrib and stem, and photosynthetic cells of tobacco cotyledons). The promoter for chloroplast GS2 retains the ability to confer light-regulated gene expression in the heterologous transgenic tobacco system in a manner analogous to the light-regulated expression of the cognate gene for chloroplast GS2 in pea. These expression patterns reflect the physiological role of the chloroplast GS2 isoform in the assimilation of ammonia generated by nitrite reduction and photorespiration. In contrast, the promoter for cytosolic GS3A directs expression of GUS specifically within the phloem elements in all organs of mature plants. This phloem-specific expression pattern suggests that the cytosolic GS3A isoenzyme functions to generate glutamine for intercellular nitrogen transport. In germinating seedlings, the intense expression of the cytosolic GS3A-GUS transgene in the vasculature of cotyledons reveals a role for cytosolic GS in the mobilization of seed storage reserves. The distinct, cell-specific patterns of expression conferred by the promoters for chloroplast GS2 and cytosolic GS3A indicate that the corresponding GS isoforms perform separate metabolic functions.\r"

Using strain MG1655 of Escherichia coli K-12 (F-, lambda-), we have determined the effects of polyamines and changes in growth rate on the transcription of several ribosomal genes and the polyamine-synthesizing enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxy-lyase; EC 4.1.1.17) and arginine decarboxylase (L-arginine carboxylyase; EC 4.1.1.19). Ribosomal proteins S20 and L34 can be differentiated from the other ribosomal proteins studied; the transcription of S20 and L34 is especially sensitive to polyamines and less sensitive to changes in growth rates. In contrast, the transcription of S10, S15, S19, L2, L4, L20, L22, and L23 is insensitive to polyamines although it is particularly sensitive to changes in growth rates. Like S20 and L34, the transcription of ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase is especially sensitive to polyamines. Polyamines specifically enhance the transcription of ribosomal proteins S20 and L34, and decrease that of ornithine decarboxylase and arginine decarboxylase. It is evident that polyamines can exert both positive and negative regulation of gene expression in E. coli that can be differentiated from the effects caused by changes in growth rates.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system caused by the JC virus (JCV), a human papovavirus. PML is a relatively rare disease seen predominantly in immunocompromised individuals and is a frequent complication observed in AIDS patients. The significantly higher incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders has suggested that the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in the brain may directly or indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease. In the present study we have examined the expression of the JCV genome in both glial and non-glial cells in the presence of HIV-1 regulatory proteins. We find that the HIV-1-encoded trans-regulatory protein tat increases the basal activity of the JCV late promoter, JCVL, in glial cells. In a reciprocal experiment, the JCV early protein, the large tumor antigen, stimulates expression from JCVL and HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoter in both glial and non-glial cells. This trans-activation occurs at the level of RNA synthesis, as measured by the rate of transcription, stability of the message, and translation. We conclude that the presence of the HIV-1-encoded tat protein may positively affect the JCV lytic cycle in glial cells by stimulating JCV gene expression. Our results suggest a mechanism for the relatively high incidence of PML in AIDS patients than in other immunosuppressive disorders. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the HIV-1 regulatory protein tat may stimulate other viral and perhaps cellular promoters, in addition to its own.\r"

  ".W": "The hepatic plasma membrane fatty acid-binding protein (h-FABPPM) and the mitochondrial isoenzyme of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (mGOT) of rat liver have similar amino acid compositions and identical amino acid sequences for residues 3-24. Both proteins migrate with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa on SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, have a similar pattern of basic charge isomers on isoelectric focusing, are eluted similarly from four different high-performance liquid chromatographic columns, have absorption maxima at 435 nm under acid conditions and 354 nm at pH 8.3, and bind oleate with a Ka approximately 1.2-1.4 x 10(7) M-1. Sinusoidally enriched liver plasma membranes and purified h-FABPPM have GOT enzymatic activity; the relative specific activities (units/mg) of the membranes and purified protein suggest that h-FABPPM constitutes 1-2% of plasma membrane protein in the rat hepatocyte. Monospecific rabbit antiserum against h-FABPPM reacts on Western blotting with mGOT, and vice versa. Antisera against both proteins produce plasma membrane immunofluorescence in rat hepatocytes and selectively inhibit the hepatocellular uptake of [3H]oleate but not that of [35S]sulfobromophthalein or [14C]taurocholate. The inhibition of oleate uptake produced by anti-h-FABPPM can be eliminated by preincubation of the antiserum with mGOT; similarly, the plasma membrane immunofluorescence produced by either antiserum can be eliminated by preincubation with the other antigen. These data suggest that h-FABPPM and mGOT are closely related.\r"

The enzyme is composed of a catalytic sector with five subunits (A-E) and a membrane sector containing at least two subunits (a and c). We disrupted two genes of this enzyme, in yeast cells, one encoding a subunit of the membrane sector (subunit c) and another encoding a subunit of the catalytic sector (subunit B). The resulting mutants did not grow in medium with a pH value higher than 6.5 and grew well only within a narrow pH range around 5.5. Transformation of the mutants with plasmids containing the corresponding genes repaired the mutations. Thus failure to lower the pH in the vacuolar system of yeast, and probably other eukaryotic cells, is lethal and the mutants may survive only if a low external pH allows for this acidification by fluid-phase endocytosis.\r"

DNA sequencing of this eukaryotic RF cDNA revealed a remarkable sequence similarity to bacterial and mitochondrial tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetases, with the greatest similarity confined to the synthetase active site, and no obvious similarity to bacterial RFs.\r"

However, direct evidence for inhibition of repair enzymes has been lacking. Using purified Escherichia coli DNA photolyase and (A)BC excinuclease, we show that the drug inhibits photoreactivation and nucleotide excision repair by two different mechanisms. Caffeine inhibits photoreactivation by interfering with the specific binding of photolyase to damaged DNA, and it inhibits nucleotide excision repair by promoting nonspecific binding of the damage-recognition subunit, UvrA, of (A)BC excinuclease. A number of other intercalators, including acriflavin and ethidium bromide, appear to inhibit the excinuclease by a similar mechanism--that is, by trapping the UvrA subunit in nonproductive complexes on undamaged DNA.\r"

  ".U": "90239054\r", 
  ".W": "2'(3')-O-(N-Methyl)anthraniloylguanosine 5'-triphosphate (mantGTP) is a fluorescent analogue of GTP that has similar properties to the physiological substrate in terms of its binding constant and the kinetics of its interactions with p21NRAS, the NRAS protooncogene product. There is a 3-fold increase in fluorescence intensity when mantGTP binds to p21NRAS. The rate constant for the cleavage of mantGTP complexed with the protein is similar to that of GTP, and cleavage is accompanied by a fluorescence intensity change in the wild-type protein complex. A two-phase fluorescence change also occurs when the nonhydrolyzable analogue 2'(3')-O-(N-methyl)anthraniloylguanosine 5'-[beta, gamma-imido]triphosphate (mantp[NH]ppG) binds to wild-type p21NRAS. The second phase occurs at the same rate as the second phase observed after mantGTP binding. Thus this second phase is probably a conformation change of the p21NRAS nucleotiside triphosphate complex and that the change controls the rate of GTP hydrolysis on the protein. With a transforming mutant, [Asp12]-p21NRAS, there is no second phase of the fluorescence change after mantGTP or mantp[NH]ppG binding, even though mantGTP is hydrolyzed. This shows that an equivalent conformational change does not occur and thus the mutant may stay in a \"GTP-like\" conformation throughout the GTPase cycle. These results are discussed in terms of the proposed role of p21NRAS in signal transduction and the transforming properties of the mutant.\r"

If males provide little or no aid to offspring, a high (up to 2-fold) extra average fitness has to emerge as a property of a sexual parentage if sex is to be stable. The advantage must presumably come from recombination but has been hard to identify. It may well lie in the necessity to recombine defenses to defeat numerous parasites. A model demonstrating this works best for contesting hosts whose defense polymorphisms are constrained to low mutation rates. A review of the literature shows that the predictions of parasite coevolution fit well with the known ecology of sex. Moreover, parasite coevolution is superior to previous models of the evolution of sex by supporting the stability of sex under the following challenging conditions: very low fecundity, realistic patterns of genotype fitness and changing environment, and frequent mutation to parthenogenesis, even while sex pays the full 2-fold cost.\r"

The endonuclease shows specificity for the intronless form of the td gene. Highly purified endonuclease cleaves the DNA of the intronless form of the td gene in vitro at 24 bp upstream of the exon 1-exon 2 junction, generating a 2-base staggered cut with 3'-hydroxyl overhangs. Although the endonuclease cleaves in exon 1, it requires some exon 2 sequence for recognition. The maximum recognition sequence lies in an 87-bp stretch, from 52 bp upstream to 35 bp downstream of the cleavage site, ending at 11 bp into exon 2. The td intron endonuclease appears involved in the conversion of the intronless form of td to intron-containing td gene in the T-even phages. A role for intron mobility is discussed.\r"

  ".U": "90239059\r", 
  ".W": "Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) are cell surface glycoproteins that play important roles in morphogenesis and histogenesis, particularly in defining discrete borders between cell populations. Previous studies have suggested that the cytoplasmic domains of CAMs play a significant role in their adhesion properties. These domains may also be involved in regulating other cellular interactions, such as those involved in the sorting-out of cells to form tissues. In the present studies, we have compared the effects of replacing the cytoplasmic domain of one CAM with that of another CAM of different homophilic binding specificity on cell adhesion and cell sorting-out. The molecules studied were liver CAM (L-CAM) and the neural CAM (N-CAM) sd polypeptide. One cDNA was constructed that encodes a chimeric molecule composed of the extracellular domain of L-CAM and the cytoplasmic plus transmembrane domains of the sd polypeptide of chicken N-CAM (called L/N-CAM). Another was constructed encoding a truncated L-CAM missing the last 50 residues of the cytoplasmic domain. Permanently transfected lines of mouse L cells were obtained expressing the truncated L-CAM (\"L-L-50 cells\") or the chimeric L/N-CAM (\"L-L/N cells\") and were compared with cells expressing intact L-CAM (\"L-L cells\"). Immunoblotting and ELISA analyses demonstrated that these various cell lines expressed similar amounts of CAMs at the cell surface. Aggregation of L-L and L-L/N cells occurred at similar rates in short-term aggregation assays and was inhibited by antibodies to the extracellular L-CAM binding domain. In contrast, L-L-50 cells did not aggregate. Incubation of transfected cells with cytochalasin D, which disrupts microfilaments, markedly inhibited aggregation of L-L cells but had no effect on L-L/N cell aggregation. Mixed L-L and L-L/N cells co-aggregated in short-term assays; in the longer-term sorting-out assays, however, they behaved differently: L-L cells sorted out from both L-L/N and untransfected cells, whereas L-L/N cells did not sort out from untransfected cells. These studies not only suggest that interactions of cytoplasmic domains of different CAMs with the cytoskeleton can modulate cell adhesion but also suggest that specific interactions with certain cytoskeletal components are required for events such as cell sorting and cell patterning.\r"

Kinetochores of mitotic chromosomes and prekinetochores of interphase cells were specifically stained using conventional indirect immunofluorescence procedures as well as a nonfading immunogold-silver-enhanced technique and analyzed by fluorescence and video microscopy. In interphase, prekinetochores were either single or double structures depending on the stage of the cell cycle but became quadruple (two distinct stained dots on each chromatid) in mid-to-late prophase. In favorable preparations of prometaphase chromosomes, multiple subunits could be resolved within each sister kinetochore suggesting a compound organization. Western blot analysis demonstrated common epitopes in centromeric peptides of HeLa and Haemanthus cell extracts. Although the molecular mass of individual polypeptides differed in the two species, the presence of shared epitopes indicates striking conservation of centromere/kinetochore components throughout evolution.\r"

Thirty patients with posttraumatic hand edema were randomly assigned to IPC, HVPC, or placebo-HVPC groups (10 patients in each group). Patients received a single application of the respective treatment for 30 minutes. Measurements were made before and after a 10-minute rest period and after the 30-minute treatment. A volumetric method was used to quantify edema reduction. Reduction in hand edema was significant between the IPC and placebo-HVPC groups (p = .01). Differences in edema reduction between the HVPC and placebo-HVPC groups did not reach statistical significance (p = .04), but were considered clinically significant. There was no significant difference between the IPC and HVPC groups. A single 30-minute administration of IPC produced a significant reduction in hand edema. Additional clinical studies are needed to delineate maximally effective treatment protocols for reduction of chronic posttraumatic hand edema.

  ".W": "Although bacteriophage T4 late promoters are selectively recognized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase bearing a single protein encoded by T4 gene 55 (gp55), efficient transcription at these promoters requires enhancement by the three T4 DNA polymerase accessory proteins, bound to distal \"mobile enhancer\" sites. Two principles are shown to govern this transcriptional enhancement: (i) Promoter recognition and communication between the enhancer and the promoter require separate phage-coded proteins. Only RNA polymerase that has the T4 gene 33 protein (gp33) bound to it is subject to enhancement by the three DNA replication proteins. (ii) Transcriptional enhancement in this prokaryotic system is promoter-specific. Promoter specificity is generated by a direct competition of phage T4 gp33 and gp55 with the E. coli promoter recognition protein, sigma 70, for binding to the E. coli RNA polymerase core. Thus, polymerase that contains sigma 70 is competent to transcribe T4 early and middle genes, but lacks the ability to be enhanced by the DNA replication proteins, while polymerase that contains gp55 and gp33 is capable of enhancement via gp33, but its activity is restricted to T4 late promoters by gp55.\r"

This neurotoxicity of L-cysteine, in vitro or in vivo, has now been shown to be mediated primarily through the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptor (with quisqualate receptor participation at higher concentrations). In addition, the excitotoxic potency of L-cysteine was substantially increased in the presence of physiological concentrations of bicarbonate ion. L-Cysteine is naturally present in the human brain and in the environment, and is much more powerful than beta-N-methylamino-L-alanine, a bicarbonate-dependent excitotoxin, which has been implicated in an adult neurodegenerative disorder endemic to Guam. Thus, the potential involvement of this common sulfur-containing amino acid in neurodegenerative processes affecting the central nervous system warrants consideration.\r"

Complementary DNAs were cloned that encode the 67-kilodalton (kD) cytosolic oxidase factor (p67), which is deficient in 5% of CGD patients. Recombinant p67 (r-p67) partially restored NADPH oxidase activity to p67-deficient neutrophil cytosol from these patients. The p67 cDNA encodes a 526-amino acid protein with acidic middle and carboxyl-terminal domains that are similar to a sequence motif found in the noncatalytic domain of src-related tyrosine kinases. This motif was recently noted in phospholipase C-gamma, nonerythroid alpha-spectrin (fodrin), p21ras-guanosine triphophatase-activating protein (GAP), myosin-1 isoforms, yeast proteins cdc-25 and fus-1, and the 47-kD phagocyte oxidase factor (p47), which suggests the possibility of common regulatory features.\r"

Three different cyclosporine infusion rates were used: 0.06, 0.6, and 4.0 mg/kg/day. Control animals received the intravenous vehicle of cyclosporine at the same rate as the treated animals; a second control group received insulin, 0.42 units/kg/day. Hepatocyte 3H-thymidine-labeled mitoses (index of hyperplasia) and hepatocyte volume (index of hypertrophy) were studied in the left (infused) and right (control) lobes in each animal. Cyclosporine vehicle had no measurable effect on hepatocytes that suffered typical atrophy and moderate increase in mitotic index after the Eck fistula. Cyclosporine infusion stimulated cell renewal significantly and restored hepatocyte size in the infused lobes with a dose-response relation. Similar positive effects were observed in the right (nonperfused) lobes, although they were less than those in the left (infused) lobes. This was because of an unmistakable spillover of cyclosporine from the infused lobes, especially in the large-dose group. No sign of hepatotoxicity was detected at any cyclosporine infusion rate. Cyclosporine has a remarkable hepatotropic effect that may be helpful in the context of liver transplantation.\r"

All patients had mammographic evidence of benign breast disease. They received 600 mg of placebo and alpha-tocopherol acetate in 3-month treatment phases. Breast examinations and mammography were done, after each treatment, at approximately the same phase of the patients menstrual cycle. No significant subjective or objective effects after treatment were observed. We conclude that alpha-tocopherol is not beneficial in the treatment of benign breast disease.

  ".W": "Dopamine is a neurotransmitter affecting motor function, and the dopamine system is the focus of abnormality in dyskinetic diseases. An important side effect of many psychotropic drugs possessing dopamine activity is the production of movement disorders; this potential problem needs to be examined carefully with any new central nervous system drug, such as the azapirone anxiolytic drugs. The pharmacology of the azapirones, represented by the prototype, buspirone, involves several different neuroreceptor systems. Current evidence indicates that buspirone's anxiolytic activity is mediated through serotonergic mechanisms. It also displays some binding affinity for dopamine receptors, which necessitates comparisons between buspirone and neuroleptic agents in preclinical tests, clinical studies, and case reports. Although similarities occurred in some biochemical studies, neuroleptics, and not buspirone, caused an increase in dopamine receptors with chronic use. Neuroleptics typically produce this change after long-term use, which is thought to be a key factor leading to tardive dyskinesia. In standard animal behavior studies, buspirone's profile failed to match neuroleptic agents. Most notably, neuroleptics produce catalepsy; however, buspirone failed to induce catalepsy and instead reversed this effect. Isolated case reports have described buspirone as causing movement disorders, but these patients were previously exposed to neuroleptic agents. Furthermore, buspirone has been used successfully to treat anxiety in parkinsonism without exacerbating existing movement problems. In psychotropic drug use, careful patient monitoring, complete drug histories, and a full appreciation for a drug's pharmacology are necessary to decipher any likelihood of a drug relation with an adverse effect.\r"

Traditionally, the rate of occurrence has been thought to be 1:30,000 pregnancies. It has even been said in the recent literature that an intrauterine pregnancy would rule out an ectopic pregnancy. There is good evidence that this is no longer true. The reported incidence in Western Europe and the United States is most probably 1:2600 pregnancies and much higher in certain high-risk groups. Because heterotopic pregnancy is no longer a medical curiosity, it needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain in pregnancy, in the management of ectopic pregnancy, and in ovulation induction. This report presents a case encountered in a typical family practice. The literature is reviewed, and probable factors responsible for the markedly increased rate (ovulation induction and increase in ectopics in general) are addressed.\r"

The first 717 EGDs performed by family physicians from 8 separate office practices provide a practical and safe rationale for selected cognitive and psychomotor aspects of continuing medical education after residency training. Although primarily in private practice, these physicians were affiliated with 6 academic institutions. This group of family physicians received training in short courses. The average amount of hands-on training before independent EGD was 8 supervised cases. Cumulatively, these data represent 227 months (18.9 years) of office practice. All cases were collected sequentially from the beginning of each physician's experience, and 454 cases were collected prospectively. Physicians reported excellent patient tolerance. Diagnostic yields were high, and biopsies were performed where appropriate. Pathologists reviewed biopsy specimens from 213 sites. The family physician endoscopic diagnosis agreed with the tissue diagnosis in 188 cases (88 percent). Physicians believed that EGD enhanced management or changed the diagnosis in more than 89 percent of cases. One bleeding complication requiring overnight hospitalization was noted. This complication rate 0.0014 (1/717) compares favorably with published subspecialty complication rates 0.0013 (1.3/1000). These data confirm the ability of some family physicians to perform EGD and suggest that continuation is safe. Biopsy analysis indicates diagnostic accuracy is high. Further study on the cognitive aspects and the defragmentation of care is needed.\r"

Evidence of chlamydial infection was found in 29 (22.8 percent) of those presenting with complaints and in 6 (20.7 percent) who were contacts of chlamydia-infected women. Comparison of all symptomatic patients with sexually active controls without genitourinary complaints showed that the symptomatic patients had significantly more frequent exposures to different sexual partners and that they, or their partners, were more likely to have had a sexually transmitted disease. Chlamydial urethritis was significantly more frequent than \"nonspecific\" urethritis in symptomatic patients who claimed membership in a campus fraternity (P = 0.004). Complaints more likely to be noted with chlamydia included itching (P = 0.004), burning on urination (P = 0.0325), and purulent discharge (P = 0.036).\r"

These instruments were administered to 280 adults receiving health care in three primary care clinics in south-central Wisconsin. One hundred forty patients were randomly assigned to complete these instruments on a Macintosh SE, and 140 were assigned to the paper-and-pencil versions. Patients were classified as alcoholic based on responses to the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and DSM-III criteria. Results indicated the sensitivity and specificity of these instruments were similar for the two methods of administration. The sensitivity of the SMAST-13 was 0.56 for computer administration and 0.58 for the pencil-and-paper form. The findings suggest that computer administration of these instruments is at least as effective as use of the standard pencil-and-paper method. The data show that computers can be used for direct entry of information by patients, avoiding separate coding of paper-and-pencil information into a computerized format for clinical systems that use system-wide computerization of medical information.\r"

New investigational agents, including hematopoietic growth factors, are being studied to combat the toxicities associated with zidovudine. The efficacy of these agents has yet to be established. Recent advances in drug efficacy at reduced dosage and in combination therapy promise to permit use of zidovudine with markedly reduced toxicity.\r"

A factorial approach is followed for the additional needs of pregnancy and lactation. For young children allowances are based on intake data. Tabular data are presented for energy allowances at all ages together with worked examples for a more individualized approach when body size and activity patterns differ significantly from the mean.\r"

By use of an age-specific scoring system and the mean amino acid composition and digestibility of the US diet, this allowance became 0.83 g.kg-1.d-1 of mixed US dietary protein--a value similar to the previous RDA but derived in a different manner.

Although world production of TO has increased rapidly since 1970, use in the United States has not followed the world trend. A large portion of TOs in the United States was used in nonfood products. Estimates of current intake of TOs by selected US population groups revealed only minor contribution of TOs to the daily FI and SFAI in the United States. In 1985 the most reasonable estimate of the average FI from all three TOs represented less than 4% of total daily FI or less than 2% of daily energy intake. Three TOs combined contributed less than or equal to 8% to the daily SFAI of the three sex and/or age groups examined.\r"

There was a significant decrease in both plasma PLP and TB6 (p less than 0.05) at 2 h. All nine subjects exhibited a decrease, and by 5 h the mean change from fasting was 8-10 nmol/L for PLP and 8-12 nmol/L for TB6 (an 18-21% decrease from that when fasting). Ingestion of 300 mL water in four subjects resulted in a mean decrease of 3.4 nmol PLP/L plasma and indicated that some but not all of the decrease may have been due to fluid ingestion per se. Ingestion of glucose is associated with a decrease in both circulating plasma PLP and TB6; therefore, carbohydrate ingestion should be considered when plasma PLP and TB6 concentrations are used to evaluate vitamin B-6 status. In addition, fasting blood samples should be used when evaluating vitamin B-6 status.\r"

Their riboflavin status was assessed by measuring erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficients (EGRACs), and values greater than 1.40 were regarded as indicating biochemical deficiency. Plasma MDA was higher (p less than 0.001) in patients than in control subjects; the concentrations were 3.65 +/- 0.70 and 1.77 +/- 0.45 mumol/L (means +/- SD), respectively. The riboflavin-deficient group had higher plasma MDA values (3.98 +/- 0.70 mumol/L) than did the nondeficient group (3.30 +/- 0.68 mumol/L, p less than 0.001). Plasma MDA concentrations correlated with EGRACs (r = 0.46, p less than 0.01) in the patients. It is proposed that riboflavin deficiency restricts regeneration of reduced glutathione making the parasitized erythrocytes more vulnerable to destructive lipid peroxidation and increasing plasma lipid hydroperoxides.\r"

Subjects also rated the pleasantness of 29 foods listed on a questionnaire. Substantial sodium depletion was induced in all subjects. Salt thresholds decreased in a majority of the subjects whereas preference judgments for salt in foods tended to be greater during the depletion period. The changes in pleasantness of the 29 foods revealed that saltier foods were substantially more attractive during the depletion period than during the pre- and postdepletion periods. These data indicate that experimental sodium depletion in humans is followed by moderate sensory changes and an increased preference for salty foods.\r"

  ".W": "Medicare's End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program provides funding for life-saving renal replacement therapy for patients with irreversible chronic renal failure. Although more than 100,000 patients are currently alive due to dialysis and transplantation, mortality among ESRD patients is still much higher than in the general population. Gross mortality, calculated from aggregate statistics such as those available from the annual ESRD facility survey, is an extremely imprecise measure of mortality and can lead to misleading conclusions. Standard methods of survival calculation such as actuarial life-table analyses provide more accurate descriptions of variations and trends in mortality. The most important characteristic influencing mortality among ESRD patients on dialysis is the changing age and diagnostic distribution. The average age of dialysis patients has increased by over 5 years during the past decade. Patients whose renal failure is attributed to diabetic nephropathy currently account for 30% of all patients initiating renal replacement therapy each year and constitute the fastest growing group of ESRD patients. From 1982 to 1987, 1-year survival on dialysis was 72.7% for patients whose renal failure was attributed to diabetic nephropathy and 79.8% for all other patients. Survival decreases rapidly with advancing age at time of renal failure, from 95.1% among patients 15 to 24 years to 52.5% for patients over the age of 85 (for non-diabetics). Survival rates for whites are 5% to 6% lower than for other racial categories. There are no obvious trends in mortality among dialysis patients over the past decade. For patients whose renal failure is attributed to diabetic nephropathy, survival rates have remained constant despite overall aging in this group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

More invasive tests such as angiography or biopsy fail to differentiate these lesions in up to a third of patients. Because appropriate treatment differs greatly for these two classes of lesions, the clinician requires a more accurate means of confirming or excluding neoplasia. In an effort to refine the preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic cysts and evaluate the utility of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERCP), we evaluated 11 patients with proven pancreatic neoplasia associated with cysts who underwent preoperative ERCP and CT scanning. Four patients had microcystic cystadenomas, two had a mucinous cystadenoma, one had a mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, and four had adenocarcinomas associated with cysts. CT identified a pancreatic cystic lesion in each patient. In all patients, ERCP showed either focal irregular narrowing, occlusion, or displacement of the main pancreatic duct at the corresponding location without the ductal changes of chronic pancreatitis. This helped to preoperatively differentiate these lesions from pseudocysts, hastening appropriate operation, obviating further testing and consultation, and aiding the intraoperative surgical strategy.\r"

  ".W": "The penetration of ciprofloxacin into heart tissue (valve and myocardium), mediastinal fat, and sternal bone marrow was the object of a prospective nonrandomized study involving 36 patients undergoing mitral and/or aortic valve replacement. Patients were divided into two groups of 18. Group 1 patients were administered a single 400-mg intravenous dose of ciprofloxacin over a 1-h period. Group 2 patients received a 750-mg dose of ciprofloxacin orally every 12 h over the 48-h period preceding surgery. In this group, the last dose of ciprofloxacin consisted of an intravenous infusion of 400 mg. Concentrations of ciprofloxacin in plasma and tissue were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Peak and trough levels in plasma were, respectively, 6.19 +/- 1.73 and 0.54 +/- 0.25 micrograms/ml in group 1 patients and 11.59 +/- 3.95 and 0.89 +/- 0.57 micrograms/ml in group 2 patients. Levels of ciprofloxacin in plasma remained significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1 until 12 h postinfusion (P less than 0.05). Concentrations of ciprofloxacin in heart valves and myocardia rose rapidly by 1 h postinfusion and remained greater than the MICs for usually susceptible pathogens for at least 5 h. Peak concentrations in myocardia were achieved by hour 1 and were 31.6 +/- 25.0 micrograms/g for group 1 and 21.8 +/- 13.0 micrograms/g for group 2. Peak concentrations in heart valves, achieved between hours 1 and 3, were 5.8 +/- 3.2 and 8.3 +/- 3.1 micrograms/g for groups 1 and 2, respectively. In both groups, peak concentrations in mediastinal fat were lower and achieved later.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this clinical study was to investigate the influence of concomitant drug therapy with ciprofloxacin and rifampin on the individual pharmacokinetic profile of each agent in elderly patients. Twelve nursing home patients (age, 74 +/- 7 years), colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were randomized to receive 14-day therapy with oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg every 12 h) (group A; n = 6) or ciprofloxacin (750 mg every 12 h) and oral rifampin (300 mg every 12 h) (group B; n = 6). Serial blood samples were obtained from 0 to 12 h following ciprofloxacin doses 1 and 13 and from 0 to 36 h after the last ciprofloxacin dose. No significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were found between or within groups in any pharmacokinetic parameter. The mean ciprofloxacin oral clearance values were 0.35 +/- 0.06, 0.41 +/- 0.15, and 0.38 +/- 0.11 liter/h per kg for doses 1, 13, and 28, respectively, in group A patients. The mean oral clearance values in group B patients for the respective doses were 0.53 +/- 0.36, 0.32 +/- 0.13, and 0.36 +/- 0.17 liter/h per kg. Likewise, no significant differences (P greater than 0.05) in rifampin pharmacokinetic parameters were found when compared with historical controls. These data suggest that ciprofloxacin and rifampin may be given concomitantly in standard clinical dosing regimens. The combination results in therapeutic levels of both drugs and appears to be safe for administration to elderly nursing home patients.\r"

The gyrate lesions were stationary and nonpruritic. Biopsy of both types of lesions showed a subepidermal blister and a minimal inflammatory infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence revealed linear deposition of IgG and C3 at the dermoepidermal junction and indirect immunofluorescence was negative. By immunoelectron microscopy, these immune deposits were localized to the lower lamina lucida. The eruption was not controlled despite high-dose (80 mg/d) oral administration of prednisone and required the addition of an oral administration of methotrexate (20 mg weekly). On further evaluation, an intraductal mammary carcinoma was detected. Following radiation therapy, the methotrexate and prednisone therapy were tapered without recurrence of the eruption during a follow-up period of 18 months.\r"

Haemophilus para-influenzae was equally common in both groups. During exacerbations the isolation rate of H influenzae in cystic fibrosis was significantly greater than at other times, whereas in asthma there was no significant difference. The distribution of biotypes of H influenzae and H parainfluenzae was similar in the two groups. In cystic fibrosis, biotype I was associated with exacerbations. Biotype V was more common than in previous studies, but was not associated with exacerbations.\r"

Drugs most frequently assayed were carbamazepine and sodium valproate, singly or in combination; sodium valproate, single or in combination; 90% of assays performed for phenytoin were from patients who were also taking another anticonvulsant. There were only six assays for ethosuximide and 10 for phenobarbitone. Physician's choice of drug dosage was recorded on a questionnaire before and after each assay result was known. Comprehensive patient details were analysed by a paediatric clinical pharmacologist, whose decision as to total daily anticonvulsant dosage was affected by knowledge of the drug concentration significantly less often than that of the clinicians for all the more commonly assayed drugs. There were a large number of drug assays that had no discernable clinical application. A more discriminating use of assays may both improve patient management and reduce considerably the number of anticonvulsant assays required.\r"

  ".U": "90240822\r", 
  ".W": "Ozone remains one of the three most important air pollutants worldwide, yet little direct documented evidence of its genotoxicity exists. The interest in the pathology of ozone exposure and the molecular events that underlie its course stems from DNA damage caused by oxygen stress including hydroxyl radicals, superoxide, singlet oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide. Although the tissue damage associated with ozone inhalation occurs at both the conducting airway and the alveolus, the cellular and mechanistic processes underlying these events are less well understood. Ozone leads to the oxidative decomposition of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Ozone also depresses DNA replication in V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts in a dose-dependent fashion (concentration, 1-10 ppm), which indicates that ozone or its reaction products may interact directly with DNA and inhibit replication. Ozone also linearizes circular DNA and induces ozone-sensitive mutant and pneumocytes to repair its DNA. DNA adducts have been implicated in aging, cellular transformation, mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and cell death; DNA adducts are products of free radical damage. These events are all common in ozone exposure. Finally, DNA-binding proteins are potent positive and negative regulators, enhancers, or silencers of gene expression. Part of their action may be related to their ability to initiate the binding sequence of DNA transcription proteins and thus form complexes. Alteration of DNA-binding sites by ozone adducts may effect mRNA transcription due to altered binding by DNA-binding proteins. This altered transcription has been shown to effect growth factors involved in collagen and matrix regulation. The present review will address some of the complexities involved in ozone exposure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Extrapolation from a limited number of patient examinations and from experiments in animal models predicts a bright future for the method. However, several barriers block widespread clinical application in the near future; technical difficulties still exist but they seem to be resolvable in due course. A more serious problem is the absence of an adequate database from which to interpret the vast array of information produced by nuclear magnetic resonance. The necessary understanding of the pathologic biochemistry of disease will be frustratingly slow to appear as will the routine clinical use of magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The critical need for improved diagnostic methods will stimulate experimentation to resolve these problems.\r"

Although a large body of literature attests to the utility of S100 staining in this condition, the few published studies that involve PNA staining have employed varying methods of radically different results. We studied formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 29 cases of histiocytosis X by using standard avidin-biotin immunostaining for S100 protein, as well as two published methods of PNA staining. All cases stained positively for S100 protein. By utilizing prior trypsinization and a three-step procedure, all cases also stained with PNA. With a two-step PNA-staining procedure, however, 9 cases failed to stain with PNA, and 3 cases showed a diffuse staining pattern that was not considered characteristic of Langerhans' and histiocytosis X cells. We concluded that both the S100 and the three-step PNA procedures are sensitive methods for the diagnosis of histiocytosis X.\r"

An antemortem diagnosis was made based on recognition of acid-fast cryptosporidia in an induced sputum specimen obtained from a 64-year-old woman with malignant lymphoma and an associated profound immunodeficiency. Autopsy confirmed the presence of cryptosporidia along the apical aspect of the respiratory epithelium lining the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles. Cryptosporidia were also identified in the duodenum and gallbladder. Immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin-embedded autopsy lung sections using a monoclonal antibody verified the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Review of our case and the literature suggests that respiratory cryptosporidiosis is characterized by a chronic tracheitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis but generally does not cause severe pulmonary dysfunction.\r"

We report a healthy 26-year-old man who sustained a gunshot wound at the base of his left index finger. He reported ipsilateral flexor pollicis longus (FPL) paralysis one week later, after undergoing surgical exploration of the radial digital artery and nerve supplying the left index finger under axillary block anesthesia. Forearm pronation and distal interphalangeal flexion of the second through fifth digits were normal. Electromyographic findings revealed complete isolated denervation of the FPL. This represents a lesion involving the branch or branches of the anterior interosseous nerve to the FPL. The etiology was postulated to be either a direct injury secondary to intravenous catheter placement or an unusual presentation of neuralgic amyotrophy.\r"

A case of CTS in a seven-year-old boy, associated with abnormal thickening of the transverse carpal ligament and aplasia of the median nerve distal to this ligament, is described. Clinical, electrodiagnostic, and surgical findings are presented: all were consistent with absence of the median nerve distal to the transverse carpal ligament. Family history of CTS was positive in a pattern consistent with autosomal dominant transmission in three generations. Thickening of the transverse carpal ligament has been described, although infrequently, in childhood and familial CTS. Aplasia of the median nerve distally has not been reported in association with this anatomic abnormality. Case reports of familial CTS are reviewed, and other congenital anomalies which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of CTS in children and adults are discussed.\r"

Experimental evidence suggests that the insula has a cardiac chronotropic organization, and may be involved in the genesis of arrhythmias seen in epilepsy or after cerebral hemorrhage or stroke.\r"

Eight of the younger patients and 2 of the older patients showed marked clearing of corneal crystals in one eye compared with the fellow eye. When the code was broken, all 10 patients were found to have received cysteamine eye drops in the improved eye. Of the remaining 19 patients 4 were unavailable for follow-up. In 15 patients no marked difference was noted between the two eyes. Eight have presumably been in the protocol for too short a time and several have been poor compliers with the therapy. These results not only demonstrate the potential for primary prevention of corneal crystal deposition but also, for the first time, offer the possibility of reversing the corneal complications of cystinosis in older patients.\r"

He died 6 weeks after his injury despite acyclovir and ganciclovir treatment that was initiated after central nervous system symptoms developed. Histopathological examination of the patient's left eye revealed a multifocal necrotizing retinitis associated with a vitritis, optic neuritis, and prominent panuveitis. Herpes-type virus was identified in the involved retina by electron microscopy. Postmortem vitreous cultures taken from both eyes and retinal cultures taken from the right eye were positive for herpes B virus. Herpes B virus produces infection and destruction of retinal tissues similar to other herpesviruses. To our knowledge, this case represents the first histopathologic demonstration of herpes B virus infection in a human eye.\r"

By 12 hours, the staining was also observed in the retinal pigment epithelium. Howeever, by 24 hours the staining was predominantly found in the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris, and only occasional staining was seen scattered in the neurosensory retina. At 36 to 48 hours, the labeling was confined to the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris. Electron microscopy confirmed the cytoplasmic localization of gentamicin in the retina.\r"

All children received a milk feed at midnight. The fasted group received no oral intake thereafter, whereas the glucose group received 5% dextrose water 10 ml kg-1 orally about 4 h before operation. The mean plasma glucose concentrations in the two groups were similar before operation and were within normal limits. The pattern of change in the concentrations of plasma glucose, insulin, cortisol, growth hormone and glucagon were also similar between the two groups. Ten percent of patients in the fasted group and 33% in the glucose group had gastric aspirates in excess of 0.4 ml kg-1. The pH of all gastric samples was less than 2.5. The results suggest that healthy preschool children were able to maintain glucose homeostasis after 8 h of fasting. Feeding within 4-6 h before surgery may increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration.\r"

Gas exchange during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) was compared with that during HFJV at frequencies of 100 b.p.m. (HFJV100) and 200 b.p.m. (HFJV200), resulting in a minute ventilation of about 400 ml kg-1 with both ventilatory frequencies, and in both groups of patients. Baseline FRC and C were measured during IPPV with the multiple-breath nitrogen washout method and from expiratory pressure-volume curves, respectively. Changes in the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference (PAO2 - PaO2): FIO2 ratio induced by HFJV correlated negatively with C (HFJV100: r = -0.78, P less than 0.005; HFJV200: r = -0.84, P less than 0.005); that is, greater oxygenation was obtained in patients with a better compliance. Similarly, changes in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) induced by HFJV correlated negatively with C (HFJV100: r = -0.77, P less than 0.001; HFJV200: r = -0.61, P less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between FRC measured during IPPV and changes in (PAO2 - PaO2): FIO2 ratio or PaCO2 induced by HFJV, as these changes were influenced more by the patient's pulmonary disease than by baseline FRC. These results should be interpreted in the context of different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms reducing FRC in both groups of patients.\r"
