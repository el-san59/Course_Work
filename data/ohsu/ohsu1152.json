  ".W": "To see whether the introduction of screening tests for post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) in the UK would be worth while, the incidence of such hepatitis was assessed among patients receiving blood during operations at five hospitals served by the North London Blood Transfusion Centre. 387 patients, who each received blood or blood components from an average of 3 donors were followed up prospectively and blood samples were taken every 2 weeks for 3 months and then each month for a further 3 months. 229 patients also provided a sample at 12 months. All available patient and donor samples were tested for alanine aminotransferase concentrations and for antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) by ELISA. Repeatedly anti-HCV positive samples were submitted to supplementary HCV assays. 1 of the 387 patients showed biochemical evidence of acute post-transfusion NANBH after exclusion of non-viral causes. Anti-HCV developed in this patient and the seroconversion was confirmed by recombinant immunoblot assay and polymerase chain reaction. Serum from 1 of the 8 donors whose blood he received was positive for anti-HCV by all three methods. In another patient HCV seroconversion was shown by ELISA but alanine aminotransferase concentrations remained normal throughout follow-up. His samples and those of his 2 donors were negative for HCV by the polymerase chain reaction. A third patient showed rises in alanine aminotransferase compatible with post-transfusion NANBH, but serology and polymerase chain reaction assays for HCV were negative for her samples and those of her donors. Anti-HCV reactivity likely to be false positive (negative by both confirmatory tests and no adverse effects in recipients) was seen in 6 of 1283 donors. This study, despite its being carried out in the part of the UK with the highest frequency of infectious markers in blood donations, has shown a very low incidence of post-transfusion NANBH.\r"

  ".U": "91172260\r", 
  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Zidovudine has been shown to be an effective antiretroviral treatment in adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. We examined the safety of zidovudine and the tolerance of and therapeutic response to the drug in 88 children with advanced HIV disease. During a 24-week outpatient trial, zidovudine (180 mg per square meter of body-surface area per dose) was given by mouth every six hours and serial measurements were made of clinical, immunologic, and virologic indexes. Children who completed 24 weeks of treatment were permitted to continue receiving zidovudine. RESULTS. Of the 88 children (mean age, 3.9 years; range, 4 months to 11 years), 61 completed the initial 24-week trial, and 49 continued to receive zidovudine for up to 90 weeks (median follow-up, 56 weeks). The patients generally tolerated zidovudine well. One or more episodes of hematologic toxicity occurred in 54 children (61 percent)--anemia (hemoglobin level, less than 75 g per liter) in 23 children (26 percent) and neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 0.75 x 10(9) per liter) in 42 (48 percent). Many of these abnormalities resolved spontaneously, but 30 children required transfusions or a modification of the dose of zidovudine. Only three children had to stop receiving the drug because of hematologic toxicity. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the probability of survival was 0.89 after 24 weeks and 0.79 after 52 weeks. There was marked improvement in weight gain, cognitive function (mainly in children less than 3 years old), serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of p24 antigen, and the proportion of cerebrospinal fluid cultures negative for HIV. CD4+ lymphocyte counts (mean at base line, 0.263 x 10(9) per liter) improved during the first 12 weeks, although the improvement was not sustained through the 24th week. CONCLUSIONS. Zidovudine in a dose of 180 mg per square meter every six hours can be safely administered to children with advanced HIV disease. The resultant clinical, immunologic, and virologic improvements in children are similar to those reported with zidovudine in adults.\r"

The tau-reactive neurites contained abnormal straight filaments, 15 to 18 nm in diameter, morphologically identical to those found in AD cerebral brain tissue obtained at autopsy. Tau and ubiquitin immunoreactivity were absent in controls.

Expression of CD45 is essential for the T-cell antigen receptor to couple with the phosphatidylinositol second messenger pathway and for antigen-mediated proliferation of T lymphocytes. In this report we describe a CD45-deficient mutant of the human T-cell leukemia line Jurkat. CD45 expression is required for the activation of a T-cell receptor-associated tyrosine kinase as well as the phosphatidylinositol pathway. Additionally, stimulation of T lymphocytes by way of the accessory molecule CD2 requires the expression of CD45. The mutation in the CD45-deficient cell specifically impairs signal transduction by the T-cell receptor and CD2 because activation events by way of another accessory molecule, CD28, are unimpaired.\r"

  ".U": "91172760\r", 
  ".W": "Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a hallmark of Alzheimer disease, are commonly located in perikarya of neurons. In advanced cases of Alzheimer disease, however, NFTs are observed also in the extracellular space. As extracellular NFTs (E-NFTs), and occasionally intracellular NFTs (I-NFTs), are recognized by antibodies to beta-amyloid protein (beta AP), beta AP may be present not only in amyloid deposits but also in paired helical filaments (PHFs), the primary components of NFTs. We compared the antigenic characteristics of I-NFTs and E-NFTs with light- and electron-microscopic immunocytochemistry by using several antibodies to noncontiguous epitopes of the microtubule-associated protein tau and of ubiquitin (Ub) as well as an antiserum to beta AP. At variance with I-NFTs, E-NFTs were made predominantly of straight filaments (SFs), rather than PHFs, that were often separated by astroglial processes and in close association with small beta AP deposits. Occasionally, E-NFTs were made of bundles of amorphous material, which showed no resemblance to SFs, PHFs, or amyloid fibrils. The antigenic changes in E-NFTs suggest that when NFTs become extracellular they lose the N and, possibly, the C termini of tau while maintaining the intermediate region of the molecule; they also lose the N-terminal two-thirds of Ub while the C-terminal conjugation site of Ub is preserved. A small subset of E-NFTs reacted with antibodies to both beta AP and tau. Although in most E-NFTs, the epitopes recognized by tau and Ub antibodies were located in typical PHFs and SFs, the epitopes recognized in this subset of anti-beta AP and anti-tau-positive E-NFTs were located exclusively in the bundles of amorphous material. It is suggested that either beta AP epitopes are present but inaccessible in PHFs and SFs and become exposed after conformational changes occurring in the extracellular space or PHFs and SFs become closely associated with beta AP in the extracellular space.\r"

  ".W": "Recently, a family of proteins containing the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp, the \"DEAD box\" proteins, has been identified. This family is typified by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4A, and its members are believed to share the functional property of ATP-dependent RNA unwinding. One of the previously identified members of this family (vasa) is the product of a maternally expressed gene from Drosophila melanogaster that is known to play a role in the formation of the embryonic body plan. We report here the isolation of a Drosophila gene that has an mRNA expression pattern somewhat similar to that of vasa and also encodes a DEAD box protein. We have termed this gene ME31B to reflect its maternal (ovarian germ-line) expression and its location within the 31B chromosome region. Comparisons with the other members of this family reveal that although ME31B is most like the protein Tif1/Tif2, which probably represents the Saccharomyces cerevisiae version of eIF4A, it is unlikely that ME31B represents the Drosophila eIF4A protein per se. A search for mutations in the ME31B gene has established that the P element which causes the female-sterile mutation flipper lies in the 3' flank of the ME31B gene.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular response to ionizing radiation includes growth arrest and DNA repair followed by proliferation. Induction of immediate early response genes may participate in signal transduction preceding these phenotypic responses. We analyzed mRNA expression for different classes of immediate early genes (JUN, EGR1, and FOS) after cellular x-irradiation. Increased expression of the EGR1 and JUN genes was observed within 0.5-3 hr following x-ray exposure. Preincubation with cycloheximide was associated with superinduction of JUN and EGR1 in x-irradiated cells. Inhibition of protein kinase C activity by prolonged stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or the protein kinase inhibitor H7 prior to irradiation attenuated the increase in EGR1 and JUN transcripts. FOS expression was not coregulated with that of EGR1 following x-irradiation, suggesting a distinct regulatory pathway of this gene as compared with its regulation following serum and phorbol ester. These data implicate the EGR1 and JUN proteins as signal transducers during the cellular response to radiation injury and suggest that this effect is mediated in part by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of the increased sensitivity to nitrovasodilators after removal of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The vasoconstrictor potency of phenylephrine and the force of contraction of rat isolated aortic rings were significantly enhanced after endothelium removal or treatment with inhibitors of endothelial NO synthase. Furthermore, these procedures led to a significant decrease in the basal levels of cGMP in the vascular rings. Moreover, the potency of glyceryl trinitrate (n3Gro) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as relaxing agents and the ability of SNP to induce increases in cGMP in aortic rings were significantly enhanced in those rings denuded of endothelium or treated with the inhibitors. These procedures did not affect the vasodilator actions of isoprenaline or 8-bromo-cGMP. In the anesthetized rat, treatment with the inhibitors enhanced significantly the hypotensive responses to n3Gro without affecting those to isoprenaline. These data indicate that the removal of the basal NO-mediated vasodilator tone in the cardiovascular system leads, at the level of the soluble guanylate cyclase, to a specific supersensitivity to nitrovasodilators in vivo. The existence of such a phenomenon has important implications for understanding the local physiological control of blood flow, its pathological disturbances, and the mechanism of action of nitrovasodilators.\r"

One domain in LevR is homologous with one region of bacterial regulators including SacT and SacY of B. subtilis and BglG from Escherichia coli. Another domain of LevR is homologous to one part of the central domain of NifA and NtrC, which control nitrogen assimilation in Gram-negative bacteria. The levanase promoter contains two regions almost identical to the -12, -24 consensus regions present in sigma 54-dependent promoters. The expression of the levanase operon in E. coli was strongly dependent on sigma 54. Taken together, these results suggest that the operon is expressed from a -12, -24 promoter regulated by a sigma 54-like-dependent system in B. subtilis.\r"

One of the substrates of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity and LH-RH- and somatostatin-stimulated tyrosine phosphatase activity is also a 60-kDa protein. This suggests the possibility that LH-RHR regulation by tyrosine phosphatase and tyrosine kinase is mediated by (de)phosphorylation of existing LH-RHR. To test this hypothesis, membranes of MIA PaCa-2 cells, a human dedifferentiated pancreatic cancer cell line, were incubated without hormone (control) or with 0.1 microM EGF or somatostatin analogue RC-160 for 1 hr at 4 degrees C to phosphorylate the 60-kDa protein. Competition binding experiments with I125-labeled [D-Trp6]LH-RH by displacement with a nonradioactive ligand showed that the LH-RH binding in 69% of the points was increased by EGF and 85% was decreased by RC-160 compared with controls (n = 61; both significant, P less than 0.001). The specific binding was altered, increasing 50-150% after preincubation with EGF and decreasing 60-70% after RC-160. No change was seen in the binding affinity constant after pretreatment with EGF or RC-160. This shows that phosphorylation regulates binding of LH-RH and may explain the up-regulation by EGF and down-regulation by RC-160 and by LH-RH of the LH-RH response.\r"

When the dose of S. typhimurium is reduced 600-fold, 15-25% of the hypophysectomized rats survive, and the survival rate is significantly enhanced by administration of tetracycline, recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), or recombinant growth hormone (GH). The protective effect of GH is abolished by heat inactivation or with an antibody to GH. Spleens from normal and hypophysectomized rats treated with tetracycline, IFN-gamma, or GH have 59-99% fewer bacteria 5 days after infection as compared to control rats. Peritoneal macrophages from hypophysectomized rats that are infected in vitro with S. typhimurium kill half as many extracellular bacteria as compared to pituitary-intact rats, and this bactericidal capacity is significantly augmented 75-95% by either GH or IFN-gamma. These data establish that the pituitary gland is essential for homeostasis during an infectious episode and that GH plays an important role in host resistance by augmenting the ability of macrophages to kill S. typhimurium.\r"

  ".W": "Invariant chain (Ii) is a nonpolymorphic, non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-encoded glycoprotein that rapidly associates with newly synthesized class II MHC alpha and beta chains in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This oligomerization of Ii, alpha, and beta and their cotransport within the cell led to speculation that Ii was an essential alpha beta transport protein. However, direct tests failed to show an absolute requirement for Ii in class II MHC molecule transport. More recently, it has become clear that different class II alpha beta chain combinations vary greatly in their efficiency of cell-surface expression, based largely on the allelic origin of the alpha and beta amino-terminal regions. Because the previous tests of Ii for a role in class II molecule expression utilized efficiently expressed alpha beta combinations, we have reexamined this question with several haplotype-mismatched murine A alpha and A beta chain combinations of various potentials for cell-surface expression. Using a transient expression assay in Ii-negative COS cells, we find that many inefficiently expressed alpha beta combinations show marked augmentation of surface expression upon cosynthesis of Ii. This effect is absent or minimal with evolutionarily coselected, haplotype-matched chains that give efficient expression alone. Biochemical studies show that at least one component of the Ii effect is an increased egress of already formed alpha beta dimers from the rough endoplasmic reticulum/cis-Golgi. We suggest that these results reflect the interaction of Ii with the peptide-binding domain of the poorly expressed class II molecules, either aiding in maintenance of a transportable conformation or competing with endoplasmic reticulum retention proteins, and thus enhancing movement to the cell surface. These results suggest a complex and variable role for trans-associated alpha and beta chains in the immune responses of MHC heterozygotes and provide a method for examining Ii interaction with class II MHC molecules independent of measurement of peptide presentation to T cells.\r"

  ".U": "91172808\r", 
  ".W": "A number of recent reports have suggested that norepinephrine (NE) produces a form of synaptic enhancement that resembles long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP, thought to be an electrophysiological correlate of memory, in part involves an augmentation of transmitter release. Although the effects of NE have not been unequivocally linked to LTP, it is clear that NE can produce increased transmitter release in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NE was capable of enhancing the phosphorylation of synapsin I and synapsin II, two homologous phosphoproteins thought to be involved in modulation of neurotransmitter release. NE (10 microM) and isoproterenol (250 nM) produced an increase in the phosphorylation of synapsin I and synapsin II in dentate slices from young rats. Phosphorylation site analysis of synapsin I, performed by limited proteolysis, indicated that NE and isoproterenol increased the phosphorylation of synapsin I at sites modified by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II as well as cAMP-dependent protein kinase. These data demonstrate that NE stimulates the phosphorylation of synapsin I at its Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II site, which is a site that has been shown to regulate the effect of synapsin I on neurotransmitter release. We have also examined the effects of NE and isoproterenol on synapsin phosphorylation in dentate slices prepared from aged animals. Such animals have previously been shown to exhibit deficits in NE sensitivity as well as significant impairment in their ability to exhibit LTP. Neither NE nor isoproterenol stimulated synapsin phosphorylation in slices prepared from aged animals. Interestingly, the basal level of phosphorylation of the synapsin proteins was higher in slices prepared from aged animals. This higher basal level of phosphorylation may underlie the failure of aged animals to exhibit NE-stimulated increases in phosphorylation of the synapsin proteins. We hypothesize that the beta-adrenergic agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of synapsin I and synapsin II in young rats plays a role in the increase in transmitter release produced by NE in the dentate. Thus, the failure of the aged rats to show such phosphorylation may underlie, in part, their failure to exhibit normal responsiveness to NE. Moreover, these deficits in synapsin phosphorylation may also play some role in the deficits in plasticity seen in aged rats.\r"

In cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, interleukin 1 (IL-1) is known to induce the synthesis of this enzyme, thereby raising the level of PGH synthase protein severalfold over the basal level. Pretreatment with aspirin at low concentrations (0.1-1 micrograms/ml) inhibited more than 60% of the enzyme mass and also the cyclooxygenase activity in IL-1-induced cells with only minimal effects on the basal level of the synthase enzyme in cells without IL-1. Sodium salicylate exhibited a similar inhibitory action whereas indomethacin had no apparent effect. Similarly low levels of aspirin inhibited the increased L-[35S]methionine incorporation into PGH synthase that was induced by IL-1 and also suppressed expression of the 2.7-kilobase PGH synthase mRNA. These results suggest that in cultured endothelial cells a potent inhibition of eicosanoid biosynthetic capacity can be effected by aspirin or salicylate at the level of PGH synthase gene expression. The aspirin effect may well be due to degradation of salicylate.\r"

Here we show that phenotypic expression of three disparate genes (carB, lacZ, and ampC) containing TTA codons depends strongly on bldA. Site-directed mutagenesis of carB, changing its two TTA codons to CTC (leucine) codons, resulted in bldA-independent expression; hence the bldA product is the principal tRNA for the UUA codon. Two other genes (hyg and aad) containing TTA codons show a medium-dependent reduction in phenotypic expression (hygromycin resistance and spectinomycin resistance, respectively) in bldA mutants. For hyg, evidence is presented that the UUA codon is probably being translated by a tRNA with an imperfectly matched anticodon, giving very low levels of gene product but relatively high resistance to hygromycin. It is proposed that TTA codons may be generally absent from genes expressed during vegetative growth and from the structural genes for differentiation and antibiotic production but present in some regulatory and resistance genes associated with the latter processes. The codon may therefore play a role in developmental regulation.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS) have demonstrated limited heterogeneity in T-cell antigen receptors (TCR) specific for myelin basic protein (MBP). To investigate restricted beta-chain variable-region (V beta) gene usage in humans, we analyzed TCR gene rearrangements in two lines and 34 MBP-specific T-cell clones that were isolated from five MS patients and two healthy subjects. The T cells were characterized for their specificity to MBP epitopes and HLA-restricting molecules. We demonstrate here that MBP-specific T-cell clones from these different MS patients and healthy individuals, in contrast to T cells from rodents, display a more diverse V beta gene usage as evidenced by their TCR V beta gene rearrangements. However, the different MBP-specific T-cell clones isolated from each individual MS patient showed a common V beta gene usage, suggesting individual-specific TCR restriction. Out of 16 MBP-specific clones derived from a single MS patient, 12 clones (75%) utilized the V beta 15 gene for their TCR gene rearrangement. MBP-specific clones isolated from four other MS patients also showed a consistent tendency for a predominant, but different, TCR V beta gene rearrangement. These results suggest a TCR heterogeneity among MBP-specific T-cell clones from different individuals but a limited TCR V beta gene usage among MBP-specific T-cell clones of the same individual. The predominant V beta gene used by the MBP-specific T-cell clones studied here was not found to correlate with the epitope specificity of T cells or with their restricting HLA molecule. These findings may support the possibility of intervention with monoclonal antibodies to specific V beta gene products as an approach to immune therapy of MS but also imply the necessity for an individual-specific immunotherapeutic approach.\r"

This intermediate decays with the same half-life (approximately 1 microseconds) as the post-photodissociation CU+B-CO species previously observed by time-resolved infrared. The transient UV/visible spectra, kinetics, infrared, and Raman evidence suggest that an endogenous ligand is transferred from CuB to Fea3 when CO binds to CuB, forming a cytochrome a3 species with axial ligation that differs from the reduced unliganded enzyme. The time-resolved magnetic circular dichroism results suggest that this transient is high-spin and, therefore, five-coordinate. Thus we infer that the ligand from CuB binds on the distal side of cytochrome a3 and displaces the proximal histidine imidazole. This remarkable mechanistic feature is an additional aspect of the previously proposed \"ligand-shuttle\" activity of the CuB/Fea3 pair. We speculate as to the identity of the ligand that is transferred between CuB and Fea3 and suggest that the ligand shuttle may play a functional role in redox-linked proton translocation by the enzyme.\r"

Recent findings that potentially reactive anti-self T cells are not completely clonally deleted in the thymus and that specific immunological unresponsiveness can be acquired in certain infectious diseases, such as leprosy, suggest that peripheral unresponsiveness can be developed and maintained in adults. Human antigen-specific T suppressor cells represent one mechanism of peripheral tolerance. Clones of CD8+ T suppressor cells have been derived from blood or lesions of patients with lepromatous leprosy who are selectively unable to mount cellular immunity to Mycobacterium leprae. Using a panel of M. leprae-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell clones of differing major histocompatibility complex class II haplotypes, suppression in vitro was found to be restricted by HLA-DQ and not by HLA-DR and inhibited by antibodies to HLA-DQ. In addition, antigen-induced suppression could be inhibited by antibodies specific to appropriate polymorphic T-cell receptor beta chains of the CD8+ clones. The results establish that activation of specific T suppressor cells is dependent on their polymorphic T-cell receptors and suggest that HLA-DQ serves as the preferred restricting element for suppression.\r"

Induction of elevated transgene expression could restore B cell tolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that autoimmune disease may in some instances arise through a bypass of T cell tolerance.\r"

Peripheral selection was found to be dependent on T cell receptor (TCR)-ligand interactions but to differ from thymic selection with regard to specificity and mechanism. Unlike thymic selection, peripheral selection required binding of antigen to the TCR, and it induced expansion of T cell clones. Tolerance to self antigens that are restricted to the periphery occurred through the elimination of self-reactive T cells and by the clonal anergy, which was associated with down-regulation of the alpha beta TCR and CD8.\r"

Because IL-2 is a key immunoregulatory lymphokine and is also produced by a subset of CD8+ T cells that are able to kill target cells, the effect of engaging the TCR of one such clone in the absence of costimulatory signals was examined. The capacity for TCR-dependent IL-2 production was lost, indicating comparable costimulator-dependent signaling requirements for IL-2 production in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, TCR-mediated cytotoxicity was not impaired, implying that costimulation is required for only certain TCR-dependent effector functions.\r"

Replacement with the isosteric Cys caused a 3200-fold decrease in the sulfate-binding activity relative to the wild-type activity, whereas replacement with Ala and Gly resulted in only 100- and 15-fold decreases, respectively. The effect of the Cys substitution is attributed largely to steric effect, whereas the Gly substitution more nearly reflects the loss of one hydrogen bond to the bound sulfate with a strength of only 1.6 kilocalories per mole.\r"

Although ac and sc have similar patterns of expression, deletion of either gene removes specific subsets of sensory organs. This specificity was shown to reside in the peculiar regulation of ac and sc expression. These genes are first activated in complementary spatial domains in response to different cis-regulatory sequences. Each gene product then stimulates expression of the other gene, thus generating similar patterns of expression. Therefore, removal of one gene leads to the absence of both proneural gene products and sensory organs in the sites specified by its cis-regulatory sequences.\r"

We studied the renal effects of a sublethal TNF infusion in dogs (0.54 = 10(5) international units per kilogram of body weight during a six hour period). The TNF-infused dogs (n = 4) had marked polyuria and natriuresis in comparison with those in the control group (n = 12) (urine output, 35.3 +/- 4.1 versus 3.7 +/- 0.5 millimeters per kilogram per six hours p less than 0.01; sodium excretion, 2.82 +/- 0.27 versus 0.75 +/- 0.19, p less than 0.01). To evaluate the role of the spleen in this response, seven dogs that had splenectomy were infused with TNF. Splenectomy abolished both the polyuria and the natriuresis; this could not be explained by the differences in fluid balance or in hemodynamic or metabolic alterations. Treatment with ibuprofen given intravenously (12.5 milligrams per kilogram 40 minutes before and three hours after the beginning of TNF infusion) in eight dogs that did not undergo splenectomy also abolished these renal effects. Prostaglandin 2 (PGE2) concentrations in selected blood samples from the splenic vein did not increase with TNF infusion, excluding circulating PGE2 as a possible mediator of the renal effects. The results of these studies indicate that, during septic challenge or severe inflammation, the spleen participates in signaling the kidney to increase water and sodium excretion. These renal events are mediated through the cyclo-oxygenase pathway.\r"

At baseline, all patients received placebo for 2 weeks, then titrated doses of once-daily celiprolol (200, 400, 600 mg) or twice-daily propranolol (total daily dose 80, 160, 320 mg) over 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week maintenance period. Heart rate and blood pressure, at rest and with exercise, weekly anginal attack frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and symptom-limited treadmill exercise times (modified Bruce protocol) were assessed. Compared with their respective baselines, both celiprolol and propranolol reduced anginal attack and nitroglycerin consumption rates to a comparable degree, while improving exercise tolerance (p less than 0.05). Treatment with propranolol compared with celiprolol, however, was associated with a significantly lower heart rate at rest (p less than 0.01). The double-product at the conclusion of exercise testing was significantly reduced by both drugs. Celiprolol and propranolol had similar effects on blood pressure, and were well tolerated. More symptomatic bradycardia occurred with propranolol. Despite the differences in their hemodynamic actions, once-daily celiprolol is as effective as twice-daily propranolol in the treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris.\r"

Attacks were verified by a minielectrocardiogram event recorder. If intolerable symptoms developed, the protocol allowed patients to cross over between treatments before the end of the first 3-month period. Four patients crossed over prematurely, between 1 week and 1 month, and 15 between 1 month and 3 months. The remaining 24 patients completed both 3-month periods. In all 3 treatment intervals, there was a significant reduction in the number of attacks during flecainide treatment (p less than 0.002). Complete suppression was seen in 15 of 43 patients (35%) treated with flecainide for 1 week, in 18 of 39 (46%) treated for 1 month and in 12 of 24 (50%) completing all 3 months in each period. Adverse effects were reported in 32 of the 43 patients (74%) treated with flecainide, but only 2 were withdrawals. One patient died suddenly. In comparison, 3 of 43 patients (7%) reported adverse effects in the placebo group. In conclusion, flecainide significantly suppressed the number of attacks of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter. Adverse effects were frequent but were mostly tolerable.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: The cardiovascular effects of therapeutic plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants in depressed patients with and without preexisting cardiac disease have been well characterized and include orthostatic hypotension and conduction delay. Bupropion, structurally unrelated to tricyclic antidepressants, is relatively free of cardiac side effects in depressed patients without cardiac disease. However, it is unknown whether bupropion is safe for depressed patients with preexisting heart disease, so the authors studied the cardiovascular effects of bupropion in such patients. METHOD: The subjects were 36 inpatients with DSM-III major depression and preexisting left ventricular impairment (N = 15), ventricular arrhythmias (N = 15), and/or conduction disease (N = 21). The patients continued their cardiac drug regimens and received bupropion for 3 weeks (mean +/- SD dose = 442 +/- 47 mg/day). Cardiovascular functioning was measured by pulse, blood pressure, high-speed ECG, 24-hour portable ECG, and radionuclide angiography. RESULTS: Although bupropion caused a rise in supine blood pressure, it did not cause significant conduction complications, did not exacerbate ventricular arrhythmias, had a low rate of orthostatic hypotension, and had no effect on pulse rate. However, bupropion treatment was discontinued for 14% of the patients because of adverse effects, including exacerbation of baseline hypertension in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiovascular profile of bupropion may make this drug a useful agent in the treatment of the depressed patient with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Further studies, with longer durations of bupropion treatment and more subjects, are needed to confirm these findings.\r"

The objective of this study was to utilize a gas-liquid chromatographic assay to determine the extent of removal of glyceryl trinitrate from the priming fluid by the bubble and membrane oxygenators. The apparatus was maintained at either 25 or 37 degrees C, the two extreme temperatures experienced by the patient during bypass surgery. At apparent steady state, the circulating glyceryl trinitrate concentration was decreased by 20.6%, 46.6%, and 67.3% with the Maxima membrane oxygenator, Cobe membrane oxygenator, and Bentley bubble oxygenator, respectively. The three-layer defoaming filters that are used in the Bentley bubble oxygenator were studied by immersing each of the three filters in fluid containing 60 nM glyceryl trinitrate and monitoring the drug concentration in Plasmalyte. The filters sequestered approximately 90% of the glyceryl trinitrate from the bathing solution of which 31% was recovered with a single methanol wash of the polyurethane filter. These data demonstrate that the different oxygenators used in the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit remove glyceryl trinitrate to varying degrees from the circulating fluid.\r"

There was a statistically significant decrement in lung function over time (P less than .001) following coffee provocation both at rest and following exercise. No significant protection against this response was observed with DSCG pretreatment. While the majority of these \"healthy\" coffee reactors exhibited baseline nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (PC20 FEV1 less than 25 mg/mL in 7/10), there was no correlation in these ten subjects between baseline responsiveness to methacholine and the degree of lung function decrement following coffee (P greater than .05).

The presence of adverse effects and the overall score of medication efficacy at the end of each week was recorded. The cromolyn sodium and terfenadine groups had comparable baseline scores for severity of allergic rhinitis symptoms and both treatments resulted in significant improvement (P less than .0001) with no statistical difference between them for total symptom scores at the end of 4 weeks. Eosinophils in nasal samples were decreased significantly in the cromolyn treated group with no significant change in the terfenadine-treated group.

This is a potentially serious error, as Bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. We studied a case in which large periodic acid-Schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma. The tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of B cereus. Staining with periodic acid-Schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies. The following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-Schiff positive after diastase digestion: B cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Propionibacterium acnes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Micrococcus luteus.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the pathophysiological significance of endogenous atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in hypertension, we investigated the biosynthesis and secretion of ANP in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats and also examined the effect of passive immunization with monoclonal antibody raised against alpha-rat ANP on the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats. The plasma ANP level in DOCA-salt rats was significantly elevated in comparison to control rats. While the atrial ANP concentration in DOCA-salt rats was not significantly altered, the atrial level of ANPmRNA in DOCA-salt rats was two-fold higher than that in control rats. These results suggest the augmented biosynthesis of ANP in the atrium and the oversecretion of ANP from the heart in DOCA-salt rats. The levels of ANP and ANPmRNA in the ventricle of DOCA-salt rats exhibited significant increases, compared with those in control rats, suggesting the induction of ANP gene expression in the ventricle of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats under pre/after overload. Weekly intravenous administrations of monoclonal antibody with high affinity for alpha-rat ANP significantly augmented the rise in blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats. These results support the hypothesis that the augmented secretion of ANP is one of the defensive mechanisms to counteract high arterial pressure in this model of hypertension.\r"

  ".U": "91174977\r", 
  ".W": "An endogenous ouabain-like sodium pump inhibitor was demonstrated originally in serum or plasma of acutely extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) expanded animals and humans. Since then numerous studies have confirmed the presence of ouabain-like factor(s) (OLF) in blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and various tissues including the heart and hypothalamus. Some of these OLFs represent well-known endogenous compounds, eg, free unsaturated fatty acids, which in vitro exhibit inhibition of transepithelial sodium transport, direct inhibition of the Na-K-ATPase enzyme, displacement of 3H-ouabain from its membrane receptor, and crossreaction with a digoxin antibody. Small molecular weight (MW) OLFs of yet unknown peptidic or nonpeptidic nature, which may be of hypothalamic origin, were also detected in various animal models of hypertension and in hypertensive patients. They may play a pathophysiological role especially in salt- and volume-dependent forms of hypertension. Our results show that OLFs increase basal and vasopressin-stimulated intracellular Ca2+ release in rat vascular smooth muscle cells in culture and in human platelets similar to the newly discovered endothelin. In addition, a natriuretic factor (natriuretic hormone) was detected by bioassay in plasma and urine, whose activity changes in parallel with sodium intake. We found that this natriuretic factor is associated with small peptides with a MW of less than 1,000. It is, however, unlikely that the two biological properties, ie, the ouabain-like and natriuretic activities, reside in a single compound. A number of circulating OLFs is certainly not identical with a humoral natriuretic factor. Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence for multiple interactions between OLF and the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the 10 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = 0.384, P = .019). On the 100 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with daily urinary sodium excretion (r = 0.384, P = .019). With the increase in sodium intake, the mean change in MAP was 0.5 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (range -12.7 to 16.3) and the mean change in plasma NKAIA was -4.2 +/- 11.2% inhibition (range -37.5 to 16). The change in MAP was correlated to the change in plasma NKAIA (r = 0.384, P = .019). Plasma NKAIA is related to mean arterial pressure or urinary sodium excretion depending on the dietary sodium intake, and is related to sodium-induced changes in MAP in low and normal renin hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "The prevalence of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (STLV-I), and type D retrovirus (SRV-D) antibodies was determined for 1229 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) from two research colonies. Serum samples were tested by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot (IB), and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). Seropositive results for the three retroviruses tested were 0 for SIV, 270 (22%) for STLV-I, and 103 (8.4%) for type D retrovirus. Of the rhesus monkey sera, 61 (5.0%) were reactive to SIV gag p27 only, when tested by IB, but were negative when further tested by RIPA. Virus isolation was attempted from cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 35 monkeys whose sera contained only p27 reactivity and none were positive by reverse transcriptase and core antigen assays to detect SIV. No overt clinical signs of immunodeficiency disease or unexplained deaths were evident in either monkey colony. Additionally, 63 of 165 (38%) human sera from various groups (primate center workers, normal donors, health care workers) had weak to moderate IB reactivity only to SIV p27, but 31 of 31 sera tested were negative by RIPA. These sera remained reactive to SIV p27 following absorption with an uninfected cell lysate, after blocking IB strips with various blocking solutions and were reactive to different SIV antigen preparations while remaining negative to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by IB and negative to HIV-2 by ELISA. These data underscore the need to adopt criteria for a positive SIV serologic test requiring reactivity against more than one viral gene product. These results also illustrate a potential problem in the testing of human sera for antibodies against simian retroviruses and demonstrate the need for caution in the interpretation of immunoblot results.\r"

  ".W": "A rapid and simple method for determining the proviral DNA content in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) from patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection was established by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. We found that the majority of HIV proviral DNA copies detectable in unfractionated PBM resided in T cells, while B cells/monocytes contained lesser amounts of HIV DNA (93.9 +/- 3.5% for T cells vs. 6.1 +/- 3.5% for B cells/monocytes: p less than 0.05). When we compared the amount of HIV proviral DNA in PBM from 13 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) before and during antiretroviral therapy with 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI) which was given as an escalating dose in a Phase I clinical study, a significant decrease was observed in 9 of 12 evaluable patients receiving the drug for 8 to 14 weeks (p less than 0.02). The decrease appeared more pronounced in patients receiving relatively high doses of the drug. These data suggest that the quantitation of HIV viral DNA in PBM by PCR is feasible and may theoretically contribute to an overall monitoring of patients receiving experimental therapy. However, larger studies will be required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this assay and further longitudinal studies will be essential.\r"

  ".U": "91175203\r", 
  ".W": "We analyzed nine sera from persons unlikely to be HIV infected which had an IgG reactivity directed against HIV-1 p24, and in two cases also to its precursor p55, but to no other HIV proteins, nor to proteins of the H9 host cell, in electrophoretic immunoblots (EIB). These sera are also referred to as having an indeterminate HIV EIB pattern or as HIV antibody false positive sera. Seven of nine sera reacted with longer (61-77 amino acids) and none with shorter (17-25 amino acids) p24-derived peptides in enzyme immunoassays (EIAs). This is compatible with a conformational (discontinuous) nature of the epitopes involved in many false positive HIV-1 p24 antibody reactions. Four sera reacted with an N-terminal, one with an internal, and two with a C-terminal fragment. Each of the seven sera thus only reacted with one of the long p24 peptides. The specificity and singularity of the reaction was further demonstrated by competition and/or absorption experiments with synthetic peptides. In contrast, 18 of 20 confirmed HIV-1+ sera with p24 reactivity in EIB reacted with at least one and often several of the longer peptides, most frequently the C-terminal one. Thus, the distribution of peptide reactivity of true HIV-1 antibody-positive sera was different from that of the falsely reactive sera. According to two of several explanations, these antibodies may have arisen because of (1) molecular mimicry by chance or by functional selection, (2) immunization by activation, noninfectious exposure, or infection involving non-HIV endogenous or exogenous retroviral antigens. The latter gains some support from our finding of antibody reactions with capsid proteins of the simian viruses, simian sarcoma-associated virus (SSAV), and Mason-Pfizer monkey retrovirus in some of the p24 +/- p55 reactive sera.\r"

Our study involved 168 HIV-infected patients (72 CDC Stage II, 48 Stage III, and 46 Stage IV) and 60 healthy individuals. Analyses were conducted using flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies. In comparison to the control group, all patient groups showed a significant decrease (p less than 0.001) of the CD16+ and CD16+CD3- phenotypes; furthermore, the comparison among patient groups showed no significant difference. It seems, therefore, that the decrease begins in the asymptomatic stage (CDC II) and remains constant during the infection. CD16+ NK cells were further divided into two subsets: CD16+CD8+ and CD16+CD8-. This subdivision shows a severe selective depletion of the CD16+CD8+ subset, but not in the CD16+CD8- subset. The depletion of the CD16+CD8+ subset also appears in the CDC asymptomatic stage and remains constant in CDC stages III and IV. Elsewhere, we observed that CD16+CD8+ lymphocytes are CD3-; complementary analysis of CD3-CD8+ cells showed a depletion comparable to that of the CD16+CD8+ phenotype. Depletion of the CD3-CD8+ subset, which belongs to the NK cell compartment, was observed although the total CD8 population showed a statistically significant increase. We conclude that, in HIV infection, there is a quantitative decrease of the NK CD16+ cell population, which appears to be due to a selective depletion of the CD16+CD8+CD3- compartment. This severe depletion appears to begin early in the infection.\r"

  ".W": "We had previously shown that inhibition of cyclooxygenase in vitro by indomethacin can cause increased formation of products of the 5-lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism in leukocytes. To determine if this effect also occurred in vivo, we studied leukocyte arachidonic acid metabolism in 12 volunteers before and after ingestion of 150 mg indomethacin daily for 3 days. Blood was collected before treatment and 2 hours, 2 days, and 5 days after the final dose of indomethacin. Serum thromboxane B2, a measure of platelet cyclooxygenase activity, was profoundly suppressed 2 hours after the final dose of indomethacin but had recovered to control values at 2 days. Mixed leukocyte suspensions and purified neutrophil suspensions were prepared and stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187 and the resultant 5-lipoxygenase metabolites were quantified by HPLC. Two hours after the final dose of indomethacin, the stimulated levels of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, leukotriene B4, and leukotriene C4 were significantly increased to 247% +/- 68%, 135% +/- 14%, and 149% +/- 23% of pretreatment values, respectively. Two days after the final dose of indomethacin, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid levels were still significantly elevated. By 5 days all parameters had returned to baseline. Similar effects were not observed in purified neutrophil suspensions, probably because of the loss of indomethacin from the cells during the multiple washing procedures used in their preparation. This is in accord with the reversible nature of the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on cyclooxygenase. We conclude that indomethacin at a commonly used dose increases the ability of circulating leukocytes to produce 5-lipoxygenase products.\r"

The animal was placed in a styrene foam box and the core body temperature was kept between 24 and 36 degrees C using a heat lamp and refrigerant pack. Lowering of body temperature (less than 30 degrees C) produced acid hypersecretion and induced hemorrhagic lesions in the gastric mucosa; these responses reached the maximum at 28 degrees C, and a significant relationship was found between acid output and lesion score. Hypothermia (28 degrees C) also caused a marked increase of gastric contractile activity and mucosal blood flow (MBF), but the ratio of acid output to MBF became greater when compared to that obtained under normothermic conditions. These changes induced by hypothermia (28 degrees C) were completely blocked by vagotomy and were significantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium, clonidine, or TRH antiserum. However, lowering body temperature did not significantly affect acid secretory, motility, and ulcerogenic responses induced by carbachol in the vagotomized rat, excluding local mechanisms (suppression of the inhibitory nerves) in the hypothermia-induced changes. We conclude that hypothermia alone stimulates vagally dependent acid secretion and motility, resulting in damage in the gastric mucosa. These changes may be centrally mediated by TRH, which is released in association with the thermogenic response to hypothermia.\r"

Recent evidence suggests that some autoimmune diseases may be initiated through \"molecular mimicry\" between mycobacterial stress protein antigens and their human homologs. We investigated whether antibody to stress proteins was more frequent in patients with Crohn's disease than controls. We used ATP binding to separate stress proteins (heat-shock-induced, de novo-synthesized, and constitutively expressed ATP-binding proteins) from crude extracts obtained from Mycobacteria and from an SV40-transformed human epithelial cell line that expresses a heat-shock protein, hsp73, as a complex with SV40 T antigen. We used immunoblots to compare sera from 34 patients with Crohn's disease, 14 with ulcerative colitis, and 14 with duodenal or gastric ulcers (noninflammatory bowel disease control patients). We found no statistically significant pattern or frequency of antibodies against single proteins or a combination of mycobacterial or human stress proteins. These observations do not support the hypothesis that a humoral immune response to stress proteins of Mycobacteria is important in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.\r"

  ".W": "To ascertain whether predischarge arteriography is beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), heparin and aspirin, the outcome of 197 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIA study assigned to conservative management and routine predischarge coronary arteriography (routine catheterization group) was compared with the outcome of 1,461 patients from the TIMI IIB study assigned to conservative management without routine coronary arteriography unless ischemia recurred spontaneously or on predischarge exercise testing (selective catheterization group). The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, coronary arteriography was performed in 93.9% of the routine catheterization group and 34.7% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar in the two groups (24.4% versus 20.7%, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis greater than or equal to 60%) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73.1%, selective catheterization group 61.3%). During the 1st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of coronary arteriography were more common in the selective catheterization group (37.9% versus 27.6%, p = 0.007 and 28.6% versus 11.6%, p less than 0.001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar. At the end of 1 year, coronary arteriography had been performed one or more times in 98.9% of the routine catheterization group and 59.4% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), whereas death and nonfatal reinfarction had occurred in 10.2% versus 7.0% (p = 0.10) and 8.6% versus 9.0% (p = 0.87), respectively. Because the selective coronary arteriography policy exposes about 40% fewer patients to the small but finite risks and inconvenience of the procedure without compromising the 1 year survival or reinfarction rates, it seems to be an appropriate management strategy.\r"

Regional left ventricular function was assessed in 214 patients at 3 weeks. The infarct-related artery was the left anterior descending artery in 78 patients, the right coronary artery in 122 and a dominant left circumflex artery in 14. Analysis was by the centerline method with a novel correction for the area of myocardium at risk, whereby the search region was determined by the anatomic distribution of the infarct-related artery. Infarct-artery patency at 3 weeks was 73% in the streptokinase group and 71% in the rt-PA group. Global left ventricular function did not differ between the two groups. Mean chord motion (+/- SD) in the most hypokinetic half of the defined search region was similar in the streptokinase and rt-PA groups (-2.4 +/- 1.5 versus -2.3 +/- 1.3, p = 0.63). There were no differences in hyperkinesia of the noninfarct zone. Compared with conventional centerline analysis, regional wall motion in the defined area at risk was significantly more abnormal. The two methods correlated strongly, however (r = 0.99, p less than 0.0001), and both methods produced similar overall results. Patients with a patent infarct-related artery and those with an occluded artery at the time of catheterization had similar levels of global function (ejection fraction 58 +/- 12% versus 57 +/- 12%, p = 0.58).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) alone or in combination with aspirin on serial measurements of template bleeding time, ex vivo platelet aggregation and coagulation factors and the frequency of bleeding was studied in dogs. During infusion of rt-PA (15, 30 or 60 micrograms/kg per min for 90 min), a dose-related increase in bleeding time was observed. In a randomized blinded study of 25 dogs, the baseline bleeding time (mean +/- SD) was 3.5 +/- 1 min in control animals and 4 +/- 2 min after oral aspirin (15 mg/kg body weight). Infusion of rt-PA (15 micrograms/kg per min for 90 min) prolonged the bleeding time to a maximum of 15 +/- 12 min. In contrast, combined aspirin and rt-PA therapy produced an increase to greater than 30 min during infusion, reverting to 13 +/- 10 min within 2 h after cessation of infusion. Recurrent continuous bleeding from incision sites occurred in one of six dogs given aspirin alone, two of seven given rt-PA alone and all six dogs given both aspirin and rt-PA (p = 0.02). Bleeding time greater than 9 min correlated significantly with bleeding frequency (p less than 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87%. Intravenous bolus injection of aprotinin (20,000 kallikrein inhibitor units/kg body weight) in six dogs given both rt-PA and aspirin produced a decrease in bleeding time from greater than 30 min to 9.5 +/- 9 min and resulted in cessation of bleeding. Thus, bleeding and bleeding time prolongation in this canine model are potentiated by a marked interactive effect of rt-PA and aspirin that is rapidly reversible. Template bleeding times may provide a useful quantitative index for monitoring the bleeding tendency associated with thrombolytic therapy.\r"

The antibody immunoprecipitated from 35S-methionine and 3H-glucosamine metabolically labeled human melanoma cells with a single-chain glycoprotein of 75 kD molecular weight. No such molecule could be precipitated from murine melanomas. To further investigate the fine specificity of the MoAb, immunochemical and immunohistochemical studies were performed. These studies demonstrated that MoAb 2G10 binds a significant fraction of tyrosinase activity from cell lysates, completely immunodepletes soluble cell extract of T4-tyrosinase molecules, and produces immunostaining patterns superimposable on those obtained with anti-T4-tyrosinase antibodies. Thus, MoAb 2G10 appears to recognize a human-specific determinant carried by either T4-tyrosinase or a closely related molecule. The functional relevance of this epitope remains to be evaluated.\r"

However, TMH antibodies were unable to react with K1735 cells transfected with the authentic tyrosinase-cDNA construct, but did react with those transfected with the pMT4-cDNA construct. The cDNA pMT4 was initially cloned as a putative tyrosinase cDNA by Shibahara et al, but it is now known to encode mouse brown (b) locus protein, which was named \"tyrosinase-related protein\" by Jackson or \"b protein\" by Hearing and Jimenez. Furthermore, TMH antibodies recognize hair bulbs of C57BL/6J-c2J/c2J mouse (B/B, c/c) lacking tyrosinase activity, but do not recognize hair bulbs of b-locus mutated DBA/2 mouse (b/b, C/C), which have authentic tyrosinase. Considering these observations, we conclude that TMH antibodies specifically recognize the protein encoded at b-locus.\r"

The highest predialysis ANP levels were found in group C (1534 +/- 471 pg ml-1) followed by group A (476 +/- 168 pg ml-1) and group B (236 +/- 138 pg ml-1) (normal range 62 +/- 27 pg ml-1). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not correlate with ANP levels in either of the groups. However, iso-osmotic reduction of the body weight by ultrafiltration was correlated with decreasing ANP levels during HD (for groups A and C, r = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively). Isovolaemic HD did not alter ANP concentrations (group B). All patients received a volume bolus at the end of HD, and they responded with an instant increase in ANP concentration, which was most pronounced in patients with concomitant heart failure. PRA was not significantly correlated with ANP levels during HD. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is a sensitive response of ANP levels to changes in body fluid status in ESRD.\r"

Sixty-seven per cent of the 30 rtPA-treated patients required analgesic treatment for less than 6 h, compared to 38% of the 37 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04). During the study period, patients in the rtPA group used the equivalent of 5.3 mg (median value) intravenous morphine, which was significantly less than the 11.2 mg used in the placebo group (P = 0.04).

Fat with 30 mg/kg of vitamin E in their diet. In the brainstem, fish oil significantly reduced PGE2 relative to mice fed corn oil. Ethoxyquin lowered plasma alpha-tocopherol by 42% and reduced the PGE2 synthesis in brain regions, and indomethacin reduced it by 50%. Thus, ethoxyquin and indomethacin significantly reduced the brain's regional capacity for PGE2 synthesis, whereas vitamin E was not effective for the period tested. The reduction of PGE2 synthesis in the brain with fish oil feeding in this study was not as notable as reported for other tissues unless combined with high-dose vitamin E supplementation.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of screening newborn infants for sickle cell disease. DESIGN: We developed a decision model that examined two strategies: (1) screening neonates and administering penicillin to infants found to have sickle cell disease in the hope of preventing pneumococcal sepsis, and (2) not screening but administering penicillin to infants after symptoms of sickle cell disease develop. The model calculates the cost-effectiveness of these strategies during the first 3 years of life. We applied the model to three prototypic populations of neonates--black, nonblack with a relatively high prevalence of hemoglobin S genes, and nonblack with a low prevalence of hemoglobin S genes. DATA IDENTIFICATION: We obtained from the published literature the effectiveness and risk of penicillin prophylaxis, the risk of pneumococcal sepsis, and the probability that in infants not screened the development of symptoms would lead to the discovery of sickle cell disease within the first 3 years of life; we used the published literature and the Hardy-Weinberg law to determine the prevalence of sickle cell disease. We used actual variable costs of screening, antibiotic prophylaxis, and hospitalization for pneumococcal sepsis or anaphylaxis. RESULTS: Screening and then treating affected black infants costs only $3100 more per life saved than not screening. Screening nonblack populations with a high prevalence of hemoglobin S genes would cost $1.4 million per life saved, and screening low prevalence populations would cost $450 billion per life saved. CONCLUSIONS: Screening black infants is very worthwhile, but screening populations in which the hemoglobin S gene is rare is unjustified.\r"

  ".W": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that administration of immune globulin to human neonates with early-onset bacterial sepsis would (1) facilitate neutrophil egress from the marrow, (2) improve serum opsonic capacity, and (3) facilitate recovery from the infectious illness. Twenty-two newborn infants with clinical signs of early-onset sepsis were given an intravenous infusion of either 750 mg of immune globulin (IVIG) per kilogram of body weight or the same volume of a vehicle control (albumin). All 22 infants survived, but significant hematologic, immunologic, and respiratory differences were observed after the IVIG and not after the control infusion. Eleven of the patients had neutropenia; 24 hours after the infusions, the neutropenia had resolved in all six IVIG recipients but persisted in all five control recipients (p less than 0.001). Ten patients had I/T neutrophil ratios (a measure of immature neutrophils to total neutrophils on the leukocyte differential count) of less than 0.2. One hour after completion of the infusions, all five IVIG recipients had elevated I/T ratios (mean +/- SEM:0.10 +/- 0.05 before vs 0.43 +/- 0.03 after infusion; p less than 0.001), suggesting a prompt release of neutrophils from the marrow neutrophil storage pool into the circulation; no increase in the I/T ratio was observed in the control recipients. Six hours after the IVIG infusions, the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen increased; no increase was observed after control infusions. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, and total hemolytic complement and the capacity of serum to support opsonophagocytosis of type II and type III group B streptococci increased markedly in the IVIG recipients but not in the control subjects. We conclude that administration of 750 mg IVIG per kilogram to neonates with clinical signs of early-onset sepsis was associated with immunologic, hematologic, and physiologic improvement.\r"

Six such children were tested for serum IgG and IgA antibody to C. difficile toxin A. These six children had lower IgG anti-toxin A levels than 24 healthy children (p = 0.026) and 18 healthy adults (p = 0.0008). Five patients treated with 400 mg intravenously administered gamma-globulin per kilogram every 3 weeks had significant increases in IgG (p = 0.01) but not IgA anti-toxin A (p = 0.406) levels, and all five had clinical resolution of their gastrointestinal symptoms as well as clearing of C. difficile cytotoxin B from their stools. These observations suggest that a deficiency of IgG anti-toxin A may predispose children to the development of chronic relapsing C. difficile-induced colitis. In such cases, intravenous gamma-globulin therapy may be effective in producing clinical remission.\r"

Forty-two patients ovulated but failed to conceive on clomiphene, and the remaining 30 failed to ovulate on clomiphene. Monitoring of treatment consisted of serum 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels and ultrasonic assessment of follicular growth. Treatment was withheld whenever the E2 levels exceeded 1,500 pg/mL and/or when more than two follicles greater than or equal to 17 mm in diameter each were encountered on ultrasonography. Twenty-nine patients conceived (40.2%), and 23 delivered viable infants. Twenty-three of the 29 pregnancies were achieved in the 42 patients who ovulated on clomiphene, while only 6 pregnancies resulted in the 32 anovulatory patients on clomiphene. Six patients (20.6%) aborted in the first trimester. Multiple pregnancies consisted of only two sets of twins (6.9%). There were only two cases of mild hyperstimulation (2.7%) and no severe hyperstimulation. Because of the low occurrence of multiple pregnancies and hyperstimulation and the reasonable success rate, all PCOD patients should be started on this protocol.\r"

An enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV was used to test serum taken from 185 cases with HCC, 35 cases with metastatic liver cancer (MLC), and 432 hospital controls. Weakly positive anti-HCV results were more strongly related to MLC than to HCC, implying that these anti-HCV results are false positive. By contrast, strongly positive anti-HCV results were significantly related to HCC (relative risk [RR], 6.3), whereas no significant association was evident for MLC (RR, 0.6). The association of anti-HCV with HCC was substantially higher among subjects whose radioimmunoassay was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (RR, 20.0) than among those whose radioimmunoassay was negative for this marker (RR, 4.8). These findings indicate that HCV infection has an interactive role in the origin of HCC.\r"

In one infant, bilateral hydrothorax preceded the occurrence of cardiac tamponade.

Review of the pediatric literature revealed a proportion of low birth weight infants among the reported cases.

  ".W": "Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) is prevalent in cancer patients. However, the effect of PCM on anti-tumor immunity is unclear and critically important in an era of improving results with adoptive immunotherapy. This study examined the effect of short- and long-term PCM on tumor-specific and natural immune effector mechanisms in a murine neuroblastoma (C1300 NRB) model. A/J mice received an isocaloric 2.5% or 24% casein diet for 3 or 8 weeks before inoculation with tumor. Three weeks later lymphocytes from tumor-bearing mice were harvested for determination of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) generation and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. Both 3 and 8 weeks of PCM significantly reduced mean total body weight by 25% (p less than 0.001) and 41% (p less than 0.001), respectively, compared with regularly nourished mice. Short-term PCM did not inhibit CTL or NK cytotoxicity, whereas long-term PCM significantly diminished CTL generation (p less than 0.001) but preserved NK cytotoxic function. These results indicate that CTL development against autologous tumor, in contrast to basal NK function, is dependent on host nutritional status. Mean tumor growth, determined by tumor-weight to carcass-weight ratio, was unchanged for both short- and long-term protein-energy deprived groups compared with results in regularly nourished mice. These findings suggest that NK function is the predominant effector mechanism inhibiting C1300 NRB growth and that NK tumoricidal capacity is preserved during PCM.\r"

Forty-four guinea pigs bearing a catheter gastrostomy received a 30% total body surface area full thickness flame burn and were given identical enteral diets (175 kcal/kg/day) except for the amount of vitamin E. Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 received 0, 4 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to guinea pig's RDA) 20 or 100 mg/kg/day of vitamin E respectively. After 14 days of enteral feeding, there were no significant differences between groups in the body weights and the weights of carcass, gastrocnemius muscle, liver, and spleen. Resting metabolic expenditure on PBD 3, 6, 9, and 12 was similar in all groups. No statistical differences were seen in ear-thickness response to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and lymphocytic proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin. However, mucosal weight and protein content in group 1 were significantly less compared to groups 2 and 4 (p less than 0.05). Anemia was also significantly greater in group 1. Histologic examination of the intestinal wall, however, did not yield any physical differences associated with the addition of vitamin E to the diet. This study suggests that vitamin E supplementation in diets of burned animals may have a beneficial effect on maintenance of intestinal mucosa and erythrocyte counts over a wide-dose range.\r"

  ".W": "Eighteen hospitalized patients dependent on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) were randomly enrolled into a prospective study comparing intravenous long-chain triglycerides (LCT) with a physical mixture of 75% medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) and 25% LCT. The TPN was given continuously as amino acids and glucose over 5 days with the respective lipid emulsion given intermittently during each day for 10 hr. Indirect calorimetry was measured on each patient before the lipid emulsion was administered in the morning and again 10 hr later near the end of the lipid infusion, on days 1, 3, and 5. Resting energy expenditure, VO2, VCO2, and calculated fat oxidation were shown to increase during MCT infusion but not during LCT administration, (resting energy expenditure 899 +/- 37 to 1085 +/- 40, compared with 978 +/- 23 to 976 +/- 39, kcal/m2 body surface area [BSA]/day, respectively, p less than 0.0002; VO2: 129.9 +/- 5.2 to 157.2 +/- 5.9, compared with 140.9 +/- 3.6 to 141.2 +/- 5.9 ml O2/min/m2 BSA, respectively, p less than 0.0005; and VCO2: 110.7 +/- 4.4 to 127.5 +/- 4.3, compared with 118.3 +/- 2.8 to 118.0 +/- 5.3, ml CO2/min/m2 BSA, respectively, p less than 0.0076; calculated fat oxidation 10.7 +/- 1.5 to 19.3 +/- 2.4, compared with 20.0 +/- 2.7 to 20.0 +/- 3.6, kcal/m2 BSA/hr, respectively, p less than 0.014). Respiratory quotient tended to fall with lipid infusion but did not change statistically. Body temperatures were unaltered by either fat infusion. It is concluded that TPN consisting of MCT causes an increased thermogenesis, most likely through increased fat oxidation, reflective of MCT's property as an obligate fuel. The increased thermogenesis occurs without an increase in body temperature.\r"

Ketone body and glucose production rates were quantified with [13C2] acetoacetate and [3H]glucose, respectively. Four additional animals were infused with glycerol to serve as controls for the hypercaloric triacetin infusion. Energy expenditure was determined in the isocaloric experiments. Results: no evidence of acute toxicity was observed during triacetin infusion at either rate. Plasma acetate concentrations increased from basal levels to approximately 1 and approximately 13 mmol/liter in the isocaloric and hypercaloric experiments, respectively. Plasma lactate and pyruvate concentrations decreased dramatically after 30 min of both isocaloric and hypercaloric triacetin infusions. Glucose production rates did not increase in either group, but glucose clearance decreased significantly in both groups (p less than 0.05) over the last hour of triacetin infusion. Plasma ketone body concentrations increased from 1.4 to 3.5 and 1.8 to 13.5 mumol/kg.min, respectively, during isocaloric and hypercaloric triacetin infusion. Resting energy expenditure increased from 3.0 +/- 0.3 to 4.0 +/- 0.5 kcal/kg.hr during isocaloric triacetin infusion (p less than 0.05). These studies indicate that triacetin can be administered to dogs at high rates without overt toxicity. The decrease in glucose clearance may represent competition between carbohydrate (glucose) and lipid (acetate). Triacetin infusion resulted in significant increases in ketone body production and concentration. These preliminary data indicate that triacetin may have a future role as a parenteral nutrient, and that further studies of its use are warranted.\r"

Six dogs received a sequential, stepwise infusion of trioctanoin at three different rates for 80 min each, providing calories below and equal to resting energy expenditure in the species. Ketone body production rates (using a 14C beta-hydroxybutyrate tracer) and plasma concentrations of lactate and octanoate were monitored. Three animals were infused with saline to serve as controls. Blood-brain barrier integrity was assessed with Evans blue dye, and brain samples were taken at the end of the study to quantify brain water. Three animals were studied under anesthesia to obtain good quality EEG and intracranial pressure measurements. Results were (1) plasma octanoate increased to 0.37 +/- 0.13, 0.78 +/- 0.2, and 1.44 +/- 0.41 mmol/liter during the three infusion intervals; (2) emesis, somnolence, and coma were observed at the two highest trioctanoin rates; (3) ketone body concentrations and production increased from 102 +/- 15 to 859 +/- 54 mumol/liter and 3.6 +/- 0.43 to 18.5 +/- 1.7 mumol/kg/min, respectively, at the highest trioctanoin infusion rate; and (4) plasma lactate also increased from 1.3 +/- 0.1 to 4.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter at the highest infusion rate. EEG changes were also observed, consisting of high amplitude slowing and reduction in amplitude of faster components. There was no extravasation of Evans blue dye, nor change in brain water or intracranial pressure. The conclusion--medium-chain triglycerides have significant dose-related central nervous system toxicity in dogs. Therefore, caution should be exercised in clinical studies with MCTs, including careful measurement of medium-chain fatty acid concentrations.\r"

We studied the growth effects in rats of a complex solid fiber-based diet (Prolab Rodent Diet) with that of three isocaloric and isonitrogenous commercially available liquid feeding formulas which differ in their type of protein (Osmolite HN, an intact protein formula; Reabilan HN, a peptide formula; and Vivonex-TEN, an amino acid formula). Total body weight gain was greatest with the rodent diet (93 +/- 2 g/10 days), followed by the peptide diet (72 +/- 5 g/10 days) and intact protein diet (58 +/- 8 g/10 days). Weight gain was significantly lower on the amino acid diet (43 +/- 7 g/10 days). Proximal and mid gut mass was comparable with all four diets, but distal gut mass was significantly lower with the amino acid diet. Somatomedin C levels on the rodent diet (13.3 +/- 1.8 nM), and the peptide diet (14.0 +/- 3.3 nM) were significantly higher than somatomedin C levels on the amino acid diet (8.0 +/- 1.0 nM). Somatomedin C levels on the intact protein diet (9.6 +/- 1.4 nM) were intermediate between the rodent diet and amino acid diet. We conclude that growth effects vary with different enteral diets (unrelated to total calories and protein) and may result from differences in the generation of tissue growth factors.\r"

The rate of rise was not increased in patients with LFT abnormalities before the start of TPN. Half of the patients had an episode of sepsis during TPN, but overall abnormal LFTs did not appear more common in these patients than in those without obvious sepsis. Patients with malignant disease, those requiring long-term TPN, and those requiring a nonstandard TPN regimen were more likely to develop raised LFTs.\r"

Breath sampling through a mouthpiece is not appropriate in severely ill patients; the authors therefore validated the use of direct air sampling from the ventilated canopy of an indirect calorimeter for measuring the oxidation of 13C-labeled substrates. Infusions of H13CO3Na or L-[1-13C]leucine were performed in four healthy postabsorptive adults and six malnourished patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN). At each sampling point, air was collected from the canopy to compare with breath air sampled through a mouthpiece and 13CO2 enrichment determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Despite five-fold dilution of expired air by room air within the canopy (a dilution required to maintain safe CO2 levels in inspired air): (1) Breath 13CO2 enrichment was accurately predicted using samples from the canopy, with a correction taking into account the measured CO2 fractions in canopy and room air; (2) the precision in isotopic determination was similar with both methods (SD/mean of 12 determinations = 2.5 +/- 1.0% vs 3.0 +/- 1.0%). These data demonstrate that the use of a ventilated canopy allows for combined assessment of energy expenditure and rates of oxidation of 13C-labeled substrates even in sick, debilitated patients receiving total parenteral nutrition.\r"

There was no significant difference in the amount of calories delivered (72 +/- 12 vs 78 +/- 18 cal/kg/day) or in the mean daily weight gain (16.6 +/- 13.3 vs 18 +/- 13.9 g/day). The incidence of sepsis was significantly lower in the umbilical artery catheter group (10.4% vs 15.4%) but there was no significant difference in the rate of infection when adjustment was made for number of days of catheter life (1 per 224 days of catheter life in the umbilical artery group vs 1 per 199 days in the central venous catheter group). Other major complications included transient hypertension in 2 (4%) of the 48 umbilical artery catheter infants and in 1 (3.8%) of the central venous catheter group, aortic thrombosis in 1 (2%) of the 48 umbilical artery catheter infants and a tricuspid vegetation in 1 (3.8%) of the central venous catheter group. Results suggest that the umbilical artery is a reasonable route for the infusion of total parenteral nutrition in low birth weight infants who require arterial access for blood gas analysis. Use of the umbilical artery catheter for parenteral alimentation may avoid the need for surgical placement of central venous lines and the risk of the attendant complications. Nevertheless, safer routes and improved methods of infusion of parenteral infusion must continue to be developed.\r"

Mean weight loss was 21.4%, mean duration of HPN 2.55 months, mean age 37.4 years. Fifteen patients gained weight, six stabilized and two continued to lose weight. Nine patients returned to previous activity. Five died. The rates of catheter-related sepsis, complications, and metabolic disturbances were 0.12, 0.25, and 0.12/100 catheter days, respectively, results identical to those reported in other patient populations where HPN is commonly applied. We found that HPN induced weight gain and clinical improvement in most patients without higher risks of sepsis than in patients with malignancies.\r"

  ".W": "The acute effects of continuous intragastric administration of 1500 ml (4200 kJ/liter) of a polymeric and of a nonpolymeric formula on gastric function were studied in 15 healthy subjects. During 450 min 1500 ml, containing 6300 kJ (1500 kcal), was given through a nasogastric tube. At regular intervals the volume, the pH, the titratable acidity, and the pepsin activity of the gastric contents and the plasma gastrin concentration were determined. Maximal observed intragastric volumes occurred after 120 min (118 +/- 16 ml during polymeric formula, 212 +/- 37 ml during nonpolymeric one) and volumes subsequently halved (at 450 min 68 +/- 13 and 104 +/- 16 ml, respectively). During the administration of both polymeric and the nonpolymeric formula intragastric pH fell progressively to 3.15 and 2.67, respectively, at 450 min. Incremental plasma gastrin values increased between 120 and 450 min from 7 to 12 ng/liter during the polymeric formula. During the nonpolymeric one it stabilized after 120 min at 12 ng/liter. When the whole test periods were considered integrated, mean intragastric volumes tended to be larger during the nonpolymeric formula (153 +/- 23 ml) than during the polymeric formula (107 +/- 12 ml), but this difference was not statistically significant. Median integrated mean pH was lower during the nonpolymeric formula (2.89) compared with the polymeric one (3.26). Despite the limitation that the investigations were performed in healthy subjects only, it is concluded from this study that the risk of aspiration during continuous nasogastric tube feeding is probably greatest during the first few hours of administration because of the larger intragastric volumes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Results demonstrated that only 35% of these patients had a nutritional assessment performed prior to initiation of therapy, and only 65% had nutritional goals determined. Nutritional goals were defined as patient-specific goals for fluid volume (FV), calories, protein, and fat emulsion. Analysis of data demonstrated that goals for FV were met on 62% of therapy days. Of the days on which FV goals were met, goals for calories, protein, and fat emulsion were met on 54%, 59%, and 51% of therapy days, respectively. Baseline serum triglyceride levels were measured in one of 20 patients. Serial laboratory monitoring was adequate, with the exception of hepatic enzymes and serum triglycerides, which were measured in 14 and 9 patients, respectively. Recommendations for pediatric parenteral nutrition therapy are discussed, as well as methods to implement these recommendations.\r"

A new pediatric enteral product (PediaSure) was formulated to meet the nutrient needs of children 1 to 6 years of age in a volume that can be tolerated. We designed a noncontrolled, nonrandomized study to evaluate the suitability of this product in young children with respect to growth, protein status, metabolic responses, and gastrointestinal tolerance. Fourteen chronically disabled children were fed the study formula for 12 weeks, receiving daily at least 90% of their estimated energy requirements. Anthropometric measurements and biochemical parameters were obtained throughout the study period. Weight, weight for age, length, weight index, triceps skin fold thickness, mid-arm circumference, mid-arm muscle circumference, and mid-arm muscle area all increased over the study period. Gastrointestinal tolerance and acceptance of the study formula were excellent; there were no clinically significant changes in the biochemical measurements. This study demonstrates that PediaSure is both safe and efficacious in the maintenance of the nutritional status and the promotion of growth in chronically disabled children who require specialized nutritional support.\r"

Therefore, the costs and effectiveness of 39 consecutive free tissue transfers in patients with head and neck defects due to neoplasia (77%), trauma (13%), or congenital causes (10%) were assessed by reviewing clinical and billing records. The technical success rate was 95% with a 29% rate of complications. Most patients returned to preoperative levels of social activities, and none admitted dissatisfaction with their results. Average cost was $27,000 per case with 16 days of hospitalization. Average cost for aerodigestive tract tumors was $37,400 with 21 days of hospitalization. Costs were directly related to the etiology of the defect and incidence of complications. Applying cost-effectiveness principles we believe that these costs are justified by the high level of patient satisfaction and enhanced quality of life.\r"

The A chain of urokinase-type PA (u-PA-A) was mainly observed in the apical portions of highly differentiated cancer cells. Increased expression and change in localization to the cytoplasm were found with progressive dedifferentiation. The numbers of DNA polymerase alpha (pol. alpha) positive cancer cells also increased in line with u-PA-A expression. The B chain of u-PA (u-PA-B), and the A and B chains of tissue-type PA (t-PA-A and -B) did not show similar alteration. The present findings suggest that the distribution of u-PA-A in colorectal carcinoma tissues, the degree of tumor differentiation, and the proliferation kinetics of cancer cells are closely related.\r"

Breathing pattern and gas exchange were measured noninvasively by respiratory inductive plethysmography and indirect calorimetry with a canopy. Eighteen patients were studied after weaning from mechanical ventilation. Energy expenditure increased by 18.3%, which is comparable to the response to major injury. Carbon dioxide production increased from 162 +/- 20 to 195 +/- 36 ml/min in the supine position (p less than 0.001), and similar changes were observed in the half-sitting position. Arterial carbon dioxide tension increased marginally (37.5 +/- 2.96 mm Hg preoperatively versus 39.7 +/- 4.87 mm Hg postoperatively; p less than 0.05), while oxygen tension decreased from 89.9 +/- 17.3 mm Hg to 62.9 +/- 13.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Minute ventilation increased by 34% in the supine position (p less than 0.01) and by 28% in the half-sitting position (p less than 0.05), while tidal volume remained unchanged. We conclude that coronary artery bypass operations induce hypermetabolism and substantially increase ventilation and risk of arterial hypoxemia during the phase of compromised cardiovascular reserves.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that cardiac performance decreases in infants undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Some infants have an exaggerated decrease in cardiac performance during ECMO. This syndrome has been called cardiac stun. To better understand this phenomenon, we reviewed the records of infants with cardiac stun and compared them with infants who did not have the syndrome. Cardiac stun was detected in 12 of 240 infants (5.0%) undergoing ECMO. The diagnoses were congenital diaphragmatic hernia (7/12), meconium aspiration syndrome (3/12), respiratory distress syndrome (1/12), and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (1/12). The weight, gestational age, inotropic support, and time to start of ECMO were similar to infants without cardiac stun. Arterial oxygen tension was lower, carbon dioxide tension was higher, and pH was lower before ECMO in infants in whom cardiac stun developed (p less than or equal to 0.03). Cardiac arrests were more common, before ECMO, in infants in whom cardiac stun developed (6/12; p less than or equal to 0.01). Cardiac stun began at an average 2 1/2 hours after beginning ECMO (range 0.1 to 7 hours). Pulse pressure decreased from 20 mm Hg (range 10 to 45 mm Hg) before stun to 8 mm Hg (range 4 to 12 mm Hg) after stun. Heart rate did not change. Cardiac stun lasted for 33 hours (range 1 to 64 hours) on ECMO and recurred in three infants. Decreases in pump flow and increases in preload, afterload reduction, and inotropic agents did not improve cardiac performance. Survival was lower in the infants in whom cardiac stun developed (p less than or equal to 0.001). Only 5 of 12 infants (42%) survived ECMO when cardiac stun occurred. Our findings show that cardiac stun occurs infrequently during ECMO and is transient in most infants. Infants in whom cardiac stun develops appear to be more ill before ECMO and have a higher mortality after ECMO.\r"

We sought to study (1) the evolution of plasma prostanoids in pulmonary hypertensive infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and (2) whether different pulmonary hypertensive diagnostic subgroups have distinctive prostanoid profiles. Our data indicated that infants with meconium aspiration had significantly lower levels of plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than did infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension but no meconium aspiration. Levels of all infants decreased progressively as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support continued.\r"

To investigate the growth characteristics of endothelial cells on theoretically suitable biomaterials, we compared three polyurethanes (Pellethane, Biomer, Enka) and three silicone rubbers (Elastosil, 3145 RTV, Medical Adhesive). All synthetic surfaces were precoated with an extracellular matrix (group 1), fibronectin (group 2), or a glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix (group 3). After the seeding of 2.5 x 10(4)/cm2 human endothelial cells into the various surfaces, primary adherence, growth kinetics, and maintenance of monolayer integrity were studied for 13 days. On the three polyurethanes all precoating procedures resulted in endothelial cell proliferation and the formation of persistent monolayers. In contrast, on silicone rubbers a persistent coverage with a confluent endothelium could be achieved only on the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix. When endothelial cell growth was quantitatively assessed on all precoating substrates, the glutaraldehyde-preserved cellular matrix proved to be far superior on each of the synthetics (p less than 0.001). These results demonstrate the theoretical feasibility of endothelialization of artificial hearts in vitro. Provided such an endothelium can withstand the mechanical forces within an artificial heart, in vitro endothelialization might contribute to a regained attractiveness of the elective long-term implantation of artificial hearts.\r"

A covalently bonded heparin-coated extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system and a roller pump were used for the bypass. No local or systemic heparin was administered. The bypass was established with an open chest with two 28F venous cannulas and one 24F arterial cannula. The arterial cannula was placed in the right ventricle across the tricuspid valve. With the lung function totally disabled, this extracorporeal lung assistance maintained normal systemic arterial and mixed venous blood gases during the entire 24-hour period in all the animals. No significant tricuspid insufficiency was observed, and the animals maintained normal central hemodynamics. There was no hemolysis, and the platelet counts remained essentially unaltered. Multiple foci of clot formation were observed in all the oxygenators, but no macroscopic thrombosis or embolization was seen either in the heart or in the lungs. A veno-right ventricular bypass offers total extracorporeal lung assistance in 60 kg juvenile pigs for a period of 24 hours. Tricuspid valve competence is an important prerequisite for the success of this procedure.\r"

The primary mechanisms include disorders of food intake, alterations in intermediary metabolism, and nutrient malabsorption. Attention to the problems of malnutrition in patients with AIDS is of paramount importance because the timing of death in these patients may be more closely related to degree of body cell mass depletion than to any specific underlying infection. Nutritional support can improve nutritional status in selected patients, and repletion of body cell mass may be associated with functional improvement. Early assessment, attention to nutritional requirements, and prompt intervention can minimize wasting and replete body cell mass. This article examines the evidence for malnutrition in patients with AIDS, reviews the studies of nutritional support, and presents an approach to the management of malnutrition in AIDS.\r"

In the late 1910s, otolaryngologists revised the physical examination for pilots, organized \"Boards of Medical Examiners\" to test pilot applicants, coined the term \"flight surgeon,\" and helped organize the Medical Research Laboratories at Hazelhurst Field in New York. These laboratories were transformed into the School of Aviation Medicine at Brooks Field, Texas, which was relocated to Randolph Field, Texas, in 1934. During World War II, the director of research at the school was Colonel Paul A. Campbell, MD, an otolaryngologist. In 1959 the school moved back to Brooks Air Force Base and was renamed the Aerospace Medical Center. In 1962, Dr. Campbell served as the director. Since manned space flight began in the 1960s, there have been many joint research efforts between principal investigators in otolaryngology--head and neck surgery and NASA. Currently, many otolaryngologist--head and neck surgeons serve as consultants and advisors to many of NASA's standing committees. The space environment offers a new frontier for specialty development and research in otolaryngology--head and neck surgery.\r"

Using DPOAE methods, the present study was designed to assess the relative contributions of the cochlea's outer hair cells to some common sensorineural diseases, including Meniere's disease, acoustic neuroma, and noise-induced, hereditary, and sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Parallel evaluations of DPOAEs were performed under essentially identical conditions in rabbit models of several of the human disorders, including noise-induced hearing loss, endolymphatic hydrops, and cochlear neurectomy. Animal studies were performed to assess the proficiency of DPOAEs to track a developing sensorineural deficit as well as to compare patterns of DPOAE dysfunction between clinical and experimental forms of peripheral hearing loss. Detailed measures of DPOAEs were collected in the stimulus-frequency and intensity domains as \"audiograms\" and response/growth or input/output functions, respectively. The outcome of analyses of both human beings and animals supported the notion that DPOAE testing is sensitive to sensory-cell disease. Thus, in combination with conventional audiometry, DPOAE measures permit a distinction between the relative contribution sensory and neural components of the cochlea make to hearing deficits.\r"

Results indicate rapid postoperative speech rehabilitation in nearly all patients, good long-term speech results (mean followup, 52 months), and low morbidity. There was a low incidence of local recurrence and stenosis, and 26 of 34 patients had either no aspiration or occasional asymptomatic aspiration of small amounts of liquid. This modified neoglottis procedure should be considered for patients who need voice restoration after laryngectomy.\r"

MR imaging offers superior anatomic resolution in multiple imaging planes without ionizing radiation, but it is expensive and has adverse effects on some patients. CT imaging offers good anatomic resolution, but in only one or two planes. CT is both less expensive and generally well tolerated, but allergy to the iodine contrast is not uncommon. The cases presented demonstrate the adequacy of CT imaging of residual tumor. However, in some cases MR imaging provided important additional detail. MR imaging also demonstrated postoperative changes within the brain stem and cerebellum. In our experience, CT imaging remains a satisfactory, unambiguous approach to the assessment of known postoperative residual cerebellopontine angle neuromas. MR imaging provides superior resolution, however, and should be used when better definition of tumor detail is needed for management decisions or when multiple follow-up scans are anticipated, so that the exposure to ionizing radiation is limited. MR is also useful to investigate postoperative neurologic dysfunction. Postoperative changes and residual tumors are more difficult to interpret on MR than on CT. Guidelines are proposed to help distinguish residual tumor from postoperative changes and scarring.\r"

The plume produced from CO2 vaporization was collected on Gelfoam pledgets that were affixed to suction tips evacuating the vapor plume from the operative field. The Gelfoam pledgets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, processed, and examined for HPV-6 and HPV-11 DNA by a polymerase chain reaction technique. Tissue and vapor-plume specimens were collected from 22 patients undergoing CO2 laser excision of laryngeal lesions. Seven patients had adult-onset recurrent respiratory laryngeal papillomatosis (RRP), 12 had juvenile-onset RRP, two had laryngeal carcinoma, and one had nonspecific laryngitis. HPV-6 or HPV-11 was identified in 17 of 27 vapor-plume specimens from RRP and in none of three from non-RRP lesions. All but one RRP tissue specimen contained HPV-DNA, and none of the non-RRP tissues contained HPV-DNA. When HPV was present in vapor, the same HPV type was found in the corresponding tissue specimen. Identification of HPV-DNA in the laser plume raises concern regarding potential risks from exposure to the plume--particularly to the endoscopic surgeon and the operating team. The practical concerns and effectiveness of the plume scavenging systems are discussed.\r"

Many similarities between patients with AIDS and other immunosuppressed patients have emerged. As immunosuppressed patients survive longer, they begin to manifest cancers such as lymphomas and squamous cell cancers in addition to Kaposi's sarcoma. Otolaryngologists can learn to identify and treat otitis and sinusitis in the immunosuppressed patient, to identify predictive early signs such as oral hairy leukoplakia, herpes simplex virus, and oral candidiasis, and to diagnose and treat Kaposi's sarcomas of the head and neck, lymphomas, squamous cell cancers, and opportunistic infections as the immunodeficiency disease progresses.\r"

The shaft, of either Teflon or Plastipore, is easily cut to size and is replaceable to minimize wastage. Interchangeable partial or total shaft variants are provided. Trials in more than 200 patients have produced optimal results. Among 152 mature patients in 85% of the good-risk cases, the air-bone gap closed to within 20 dB and in 65% to within 10 dB; in 69% of all cases the gap closed to within 20 dB. Extrusion rates were 5% in good-risk cases and 7% overall. Long-term extrusions have not occurred. Inasmuch as cartilage interpositioning is unnecessary, the prosthesis is rapidly prepared and implanted by an easily mastered technique.\r"

These findings suggest that electrical stimulation may provide a testing method by which the vestibular nerve and central pathways could be evaluated separately from the vestibular end-organ. The goal of this study was to obtain normative data on human beings for an electrically evoked vestibulo-ocular reflex (EVOR). Sinusoidal electrical stimuli (0.0125 to 0.8 Hz, 4 mA peak intensity) were applied along the interaural axis through mastoid electrodes in 10 subjects. Horizontal eye movements were recorded by an infrared limbus-tracking device. The subjects also underwent rotational stimulation at the same frequencies so that their horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) could be evaluated. Nystagmus was observed in the EVOR at lower stimulus frequencies, whereas purely sinusoidal eye deviations occurred at higher frequencies. The phase of the EVOR slow-component eye velocity consistently lagged the stimulus. This contrasts with the phase measurements of the VOR in the same subjects, which exhibited a lead relative to head velocity. These findings suggest that currents applied to human beings may activate vestibular primary afferents independent of peripheral receptor mechanisms and thereby provide a \"site-of-lesion\" testing method by which the vestibular nerve and central pathways can be evaluated separately from the vestibular end-organ.\r"

While this test technique is less time-consuming than the 5-day oral challenge food test of Rinkel, the 15- to 90-minute per test demand still presents a significant deterrant to widespread use. Here we present a time-efficient, multi-test technique that allows testing of three to seven foods at one time.

Authors have focused on perilymph fistulas as the cause of hearing loss and vertigo in many diverse situations. Additionally, surgical repair has been suggested when there is little objective support for intervention. To address some of the problems inherent in the diagnosis and treatment of perilymph fistulas, records of patients operated on at the House Ear Clinic during the past 12 years were reviewed retrospectively. Eighty-six patients were surgically explored for fistulas during this period. Thirty-five (40.7%) fistulas were found, and 51 ears were patched whether fistulas were found or not. Of the 80 patients who were seen for follow-up, 35 (43.8%) were subjectively better, and 45 (56.2%) were the same. Although the number of fistulas found and the number of patients improved were similar, the composition of the two groups was different. On the basis of audiometric results, improvement in hearing occurred in only 18.7% of the patients. None of the demographic factors or diagnostic tests were predictive of either the presence of a fistula or the therapeutic outcome. Further work is required to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of fistulas and to design appropriate surgical intervention.\r"

Preoperative complaints, clinical findings, computed tomographic evidence of extent of sinus disease, surgical outcome, possible predictors of success, and complications were considered. Indications for endoscopic surgery were persistence of symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy and radiologic evidence of a significant sinus abnormality. Median followup was 12 months. Hemorrhage occurred postoperatively in two patients (1.5%); 17 patients required additional endoscopic surgery. Overall, 140 (91%) patients believed that the surgery was beneficial. Patients with facial pain preoperatively showed the greatest improvement. All patients having simultaneous septoplasty (N = 64) had successful outcome. The total number of opacified sinuses was not a predictor of outcome, but opacificaiton of the sphenoid sinus correlated with a poorer outcome. The patients seen at the medical center had poorer results, but had a larger number of opacified sinuses, were more likely to have had previous sinus surgery, and were more likely to have underlying medical conditions contributing to their sinus disease.\r"

There will often have been multiple attempts to manage the problem medically and symptomatically with antihistamines, decongestants, antibiotics, nasal cromolyn, and topical or systemic steroid therapy. Some patients will have undergone numerous attempts at surgical therapy, most often with cryosurgery or cauterization. The cause of the symptoms of turbinate dysfunction for most of these patients is either vasomotor rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, or polypoid hypertrophic turbinates. A visible-wavelength laser with a wavelength of 532 nm, the potassium-titanyl phosphate laser has been used with nasal endoscopes to perform laser photocoagulation of the nasal turbinates. A description of the technique and early results have been previously reported. This article reports good long-term results with the technique.\r"

  ".W": "OSB can occur in the absence of an obvious contiguous source of infection. When a patient has persistent unilateral headache, elevated ESR, and radiographic evidence of a lytic skull-base lesion, the clinician should consider OSB as a potential diagnosis. A baseline gallium scan should be obtained before biopsy, since surgery or trauma can also produce positive results on radionuclide scans. Technetium-phosphate bone scans should also be performed before any surgical manipulation. However, positive results from a gallium or technetium scan in this setting are not conclusive evidence of infection. At biopsy, the otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon should consider sending a specimen to the microbiology department for culture in addition to the specimen sent for routine pathologic study; this procedure could minimize delay in diagnosis. Establishing the diagnosis in these patients without obvious contiguous infection can be difficult, demanding perseverance and an appropriate index of suspicion. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, intravenous antibiotic therapy should begin immediately. The duration of therapy must be individualized; patients may require from 4 weeks to several months of treatment. Response to therapy is indicated by resolution of symptoms, normalization of ESR, and reversal of abnormalities on radionuclide scans. Serial gallium scans are particularly useful in following response to treatment.\r"

Before support is initiated, realistic goals should be established and risks and benefits considered. Initially, hemodynamic status should take precedence over nutritional status. Enteral feeding is the preferred route when the gastrointestinal tract is functioning. In most cases calorie requirements can be estimated adequately with use of the Harris-Benedict equation. Indirect calorimetry provides valuable information in patients with impending respiratory failure; withdrawing excess calories and substituting lipid calories for carbohydrate calories, if necessary, may be beneficial. Clinical response can be assessed by nitrogen balance studies and weekly measurement of weight and serum transferrin levels.\r"

  ".W": "The temporal changes in transected sciatic nerves of rabbits were studied using recently developed histochemical techniques for discriminating between sensory and motor axons. A segment of the nerve was removed to inhibit spontaneous regeneration across the gap. Staining characteristics of the proximal and distal nerve stumps were studied at 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, and 35 days following axotomy and compared with control sciatic nerves. In the control and test nerves, subpopulations of myelinated sensory axons were identified histochemically by carbonic anhydrase (CA) staining, and a subset of alpha motor axons were visualized by cholinesterase (CE) staining. Axon staining patterns were reciprocal; i.e., sensory axons were CA-positive and CE-negative, whereas motor axons were CE-positive and CA-negative. Histochemical activities persisted at day 35 after axotomy in the proximal stump and until day 9 after axotomy in the distal stump. This implies that these techniques may aid in both immediate and delayed primary nerve repair. With time, there is buildup of scar tissue adding to the proximal and distal stumps. Therefore, sections for demonstrating sensory and motor axons must be taken progressively further back from the nerve stump ends. Histochemical axon typing indicated that sensory axons regenerated earlier and to a greater degree than motor axons in the developing neuroma. Use of both the carbonic anhydrase and cholinesterase staining methods is more accurate than either technique alone as an adjunct for examining normal and injured peripheral nerves.\r"

The other patient is a 31-year-old woman who experienced sudden onset of headache. Computed tomography scan revealed three separate masses in the brain. One tumor was surgically removed. The other two were sensitive to radiation therapy and disappeared after radiation of 40 Gy. A new lesion was found in the femur 16 months after the operation. Brain metastasis from angiosarcoma is exceedingly rare. Both patients developed symptoms with intracranial hemorrhage. The diagnosis of the metastatic lesions preceded diagnosis of the primary lesion by 12 and 16 months, respectively. Ulex europaeus 1 lectin and factor VIII were very useful in establishing the diagnosis of angiosarcoma.\r"

Selegiline (also known as deprenyl), is a selective irreversible monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor virtually devoid of the tyramine reaction at the recommended dosage of 10 mg/d. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the adjunctive use in the management of patients with PD who are receiving levodopa/carbidopa and exhibit a \"wearing off\" effect of levodopa. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted evaluating selegiline's role in the treatment of PD. Preliminary evidence from the DATATOP trial suggests that selegiline may slow the progression of PD when used as initial therapy. However, final results of this trial and additional long-term controlled trials comparing selegiline to levodopa and placebo groups are necessary to further clarify selegiline's role in the treatment of PD.\r"

Length of parenteral H2RA therapy was less in the study group (4.8 vs. 7.5 d) as was length of total (parenteral + oral) therapy (8.4 vs. 12.1 d). Parenteral H2RA drug acquisition savings were $6225 in the six-week study period or $53,950 when annualized. Decreased oral therapy contributed additional savings. There was a significant decrease in the number of inappropriate parenteral doses of ranitidine per patient, the drug used in more than 80 percent of the patients. In addition to the direct effect of pharmacists' interventions, there appeared to be an indirect effect of the program, as physicians initiated route of administration changes on their own.\r"

Hepatitis C is responsible for 15,000 new cases of cirrhosis annually. In 1990, an antibody assay was approved for commercial use.

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic value of early submaximal stress testing and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after interventional therapy. Scintigraphic results from 56 patients with infarctions, who underwent acute thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or both, were compared with late (6 weeks) functional outcome as assessed by radionuclide ventriculography and with results of discharge coronary angiography. A linear correlation was found between the extent of thallium-201 SPECT perfusion defect and late ventricular function (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01). Forty-two percent of patients with large SPECT perfusion defects had normal left ventricular ejection fractions, suggesting an overestimation of infarct size by early imaging. Sensitivity and specificity of thallium-201 SPECT for detection of coronary artery stenosis in noninfarct territories was 57% and 46%, respectively, indicating limited diagnostic definition of extent of underlying coronary artery disease. Results of follow-up coronary angiography showed a significant relationship between the size of the initial perfusion defect and early restenosis or reocclusion of the infarct artery. Thus the extent of early thallium-201 perfusion defects correlates with late functional outcome but appears to overestimate the degree of injury. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing allows only limited characterization of underlying coronary artery disease. Early assessment of infarct size may identify a patient population at high risk for reocclusion of the infarct artery.\r"

  ".W": "Results of recent studies have suggested that routine cardiac catheterization may be unnecessary after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Therefore to better define the short-term prognostic value of early coronary angiography, and specifically the prognostic significance of multivessel coronary artery disease, the angiographic findings of 855 patients consecutively enrolled in five phases of the TAMI study were correlated with their in-hospital outcome. All patients received intravenous thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator, urokinase, or both agents) and underwent cardiac catheterization within 90 minutes of the initiation of therapy. Multivessel disease, defined as the presence of greater than or equal to 75% luminal diameter stenosis in two or more major epicardial arteries, was documented in 236 patients. When compared with the group of patients without multivessel disease, this group had a higher prevalence of coronary risk factors and more frequently had a history of antecedent ischemic chest pain. Although the severity of the infarct zone dysfunction was similar in the two groups (-2.77 +/- 1.00 vs -2.50 +/- 1.09 SD/chord, p = NS), global left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in the group with multivessel disease (48.6 +/- 12.4% vs 51.8 +/- 10.6%, p less than 0.01). This was associated with a significant difference in the function of the noninfarct zone. Whereas this region was hyperkinetic in the group with minimal or single-vessel disease, it was hypocontractile or dyskinetic in those with multivessel disease (+0.66 +/- 1.53 vs -0.52 +/- 1.73 SD/chord, p = 0.0001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ten subjects (S10) achieved a mean weight loss of 17 kg over 3-5 mo (initial weight-for-height 157%). Serum was obtained before (baseline) and monthly during the VLCD and from five of them (S5) after 2-3 mo of weight stability (refed) at 21 kg of loss. At baseline for S10, the serum phospholipid (PL) 20:4 omega 6 was 9.16 wt% and differed from normal (12.81 wt%) by P less than 0.0001, but cholesterol ester (CE) 20:4 omega 6 did not differ from normal. During 3 mo of VLCD, the S10 serum PL and CE 18:2 omega 6 fell (P less than 0.005 and 0.0001, respectively). Serum PL 20:4 omega 6 rose to normal during VLCD months 1-3 (P less than 0.01) while the serum CE 20:4 omega 6 rose above normal (P less than 0.0002). During the VLCD, S5 results paralleled S10. However when refed, S5 PL and CE 18:2 omega 6 and 20:4 omega 6 all reverted to baseline (PL 20:4 omega 6 below normal, P less than 0.001). Serum PL 20:4 omega 6 is low in moderate obesity, corrects to normal during a VLCD, but regresses to the predict abnormality after weight loss.\r"

Two days later, oral aspartame (APM; aspartylphenylalanine methylester) administration substantially increased serum phenylalanine (Phe) concentrations and the ratio, in serum, of Phe to the sum of its competitors for transport into brain and retina (the other large neutral amino acids). Smaller changes occurred in serum tyrosine (Tyr) concentrations and in the ratio, in serum, of Tyr to the sum of its competitors. P-chlorophenylalanine-pretreated rats showed normal increases in retinal Tyr hydroxylation rate after Tyr injection, indicating that the enzyme was functionally normal. APM (0, 500, 1000, 1500 mg/kg body wt) intubation of PCPA-pretreated rats produced a dose-related increment in retinal Phe concentrations (up to six times normal values), no changes in retinal Tyr concentration, and no changes in retinal Tyr hydroxylation rate. The results thus indicate that very large increments in retinal Phe concentrations produced by enormous doses of APM do not modify Tyr hydroxylation in vivo.\r"

We investigated possible methodological sources of this variation. In two laboratories, milk folate content (with and without folate conjugase) was determined microbiologically. No differences in total milk folate or PteGlun (n greater than 3) content were found between laboratories. PteGlun was found to comprise a significant fraction of total milk folate (28%). Use of rennin did not alter total folate content nor the percent of PteGlun in human milk. Heating (121 degrees C for 5 min) increased folate concentrations (190%, P less than 0.0001), indicating that release of folate from binding protein is necessary for folate utilization by Lactobacillus casei. Although human milk folate conjugase, (FC) activity was approximately one-twentieth that of plasma FC activity, it was not sufficient to autolyze endogenous PteGlun. Thus, microbiological protocols that do not use folate conjugase and do not release folate from binding proteins will seriously underestimate milk folate values.\r"

A \"subjective nutritional assessment\" was made, using 21 variables derived from history and clinical examination, or anthropometry and biochemistry. Eighteen patients (8%) were severely malnourished, 73 (32.6%) were mildly to moderately malnourished, and 133 (59.4%) did not show evidence for malnutrition. There was a higher incidence of mild to moderate malnutrition in diabetics than in nondiabetics. A statistical analysis identified 12 variables, seven objective and five subjective, that correlated with subjective nutritional assessment. Actual intercenter differences for the incidence of malnutrition were related to patient age, nutritional status at the commencement of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the length of time on CAPD, and residual renal function. Variables that were most frequently correlated with subjective nutritional assessment and with one another included plasma albumin, mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC), weight loss, and the clinical judgement of muscle wasting and loss of subcutaneous fat. Loss of residual renal function correlated with muscle wasting and months on CAPD. Our data identified differences between the two sexes. In women there was a trend for more anorexia, greater weight loss from muscle wasting, and a larger decrease in albumin, whereas in men there was a more gradual decrease in nutritional status. Loss of residual renal function contributed to anorexia and symptoms of severe malnutrition.\r"

The current study was designed to examine the effect of both physiologic and pharmacologic plasma levels of ANF on bronchial reactivity to histamine in asthmatic subjects. A total of eight atopic men with well-controlled asthma were studied, mean (SD) FEV1 3.50 (0.73) L, equivalent to 87 (11)% of predicted; bronchial reactivity as measured by histamine PC20 was 0.77 mg/ml (geometric mean). On four separate study days infusions of 1, 3, or 10 pmol/kg/min of ANF or placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized manner. Once steady-state plasma levels had been achieved, measurement of bronchial reactivity was repeated. Mean (SEM) basal ANF level was 18.5 (3.5) pg/ml and rose to 41 (4.3), 157 (15), and 500 (30) pg/ml with increasing doses of ANF. With placebo infusion geometric mean histamine PC20 was 0.77 mg/ml and rose to 1.15 mg/ml (p less than 0.05), 1.90 mg/ml (p less than 0.001), and 3.38 mg/ml (p less than 0.001), corresponding to a 1.5-, 2.5-, and 4.4-fold protection with respective ANF infusions. There was no significant change in plasma epinephrine. These results show that at both physiologic and pathophysiologic plasma levels ANF may significantly decrease bronchial reactivity to histamine in asthma.\r"

We tested the hypothesis that eugenol directly causes lung edema through oxidant-mediated mechanisms by infusing eugenol (0.1 and 1.0 mM) into isolated rabbit lungs perfused with a cell-free albumin and physiologic salt solution. We observed lung edema (1.0 mM) as demonstrated by increased lung weight gain and wet-to-dry lung weight ratios without alterations in mean pulmonary artery pressure. The oxygen metabolite scavengers catalase (1,000 U/ml) and dimethylthiourea (30 mM) attenuated lung edema. Instillation of dimethylurea, superoxide dismutase, or heat-inactivated catalase did not prevent lung edema formation. We conclude that eugenol causes lung edema in isolated lungs through oxidant-mediated mechanisms in the absence of circulating formed blood elements. Eugenol may be a valuable compound in the laboratory investigation of edemogenic disorders.\r"

One hundred twenty-two asbestos-exposed subsets (AES), including 27 nonsmokers (NS), were evaluated and compared with 10 unexposed normal subjects. Data were collected on medical, smoking, and occupational histories, physical examination, spirometry, lung volumes, single-breath DLCO, chest films read by a \"B\" reader, and T-lymphocyte characterization in blood and BAL using flow cytometry analysis of monoclonal-antibody-treated cells. On average, AES were 47 yr of age and had 23 yr of asbestos exposure. Fifty-eight (48%) had pleural thickening, and seven (6%) had profusion greater than or equal to 1/0. In blood, asbestos-exposed NS had lower total and percent CD8 and lower total CD3 than did normal subjects. In BAL, asbestos-exposed NS had higher total CD3 than did normal subjects. Among AES, increased asbestos exposure was associated with increased percent CD8 in BAL and decreases in both percent lymphocytes and total CD8 in blood. Increase in CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL were associated with pleural thickening. In those seven with profusion greater than or equal to 1/0, there was increased percent CD4 in blood and decreased percent CD8 in BAL. These results suggest immune imbalance favoring helper-inducer T-cell subsets in association with asbestos exposure systemically and with pleural plaques in BAL.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To characterize the nature of this cell-retrovirus interaction within the lower respiratory tract we analyzed fluid and cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of eight individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who were undergoing diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Of these eight individuals, seven had active infection with Pneumocystis carinii; one had suspected cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. At the time of study two were receiving the antiretroviral drug zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]). HIV-1 could not be isolated from any of the eight samples of BAL fluid concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose. HIV-1 antigen (p24) was detected in one of eight samples of concentrated BAL fluid but could not be found in eight samples of media conditioned by overnight incubation with adherent BAL cells. Despite the infrequent detection of HIV-1 antigen it was possible to identify HIV-1 genomic sequences by the use of a DNA amplification technique, the polymerase chain reaction, in all eight BAL cell preparations. In BAL cells adherent for up to 5 days in culture this method detected retroviral DNA that hybridized to a complementary pair of primers located in the env and gag gene regions of HIV-1. These studies demonstrate the uniform presence of HIV-1 harboring cells within the airways of the lung in individuals with AIDS and active respiratory infection and may have implications for local organ defense.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The objective of this report is to present a reanalysis of the relative efficacies of these treatments in patients with unipolar disorder to focus attention on general issues related to the design and conduct of maintenance therapy trials. We show that the earlier conclusions of that study that imipramine and the combination therapy are more effective than lithium and placebo in preventing the recurrence of depression in unipolar patients can be accounted for by alternative explanations that are a consequence of the design of the study. Our findings have important implications for the design, conduct, and interpretation of results of maintenance therapy clinical trials in general.\r"

Except for low-risk biliary procedures, cephalosporin therapy was accompanied by the administration of metronidazole. No significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection, ie, 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval, 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval, 4.9% to 8.9%). Single-dose prophylaxis with 1 g of cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate was relatively inexpensive and provided a cost savings of 64%.

Postoperatively, the patient followed a diet of intravenous nutrition only. Uneventful convalescence was interrupted by signs of sudden major blood loss, accompanied by prolonged prothrombin time. After stabilization with packed red blood cells, fresh plasma, crystalloids, and parenteral vitamin K, laparotomy revealed a huge intra-abdominal clot, which was evacuated. This case illustrates the risk of unexpected hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a cefotetan-treated surgical patient who demonstrated none of the usual comorbid conditions generally described in patients with antibiotic-induced hypoprothrombinemia. Like cefamandole nafate, cefoperazone sodium, moxalactam disodium, and other cephalosporins containing the methylthiotetrazole side chain, cefotetan appears to pose an unusual risk of major bleeding.\r"

Retrospective analysis disclosed that increasing blood pressure was associated with pretreatment hematocrit level less than or equal to 0.20 (P = .05) and dependency on red cell transfusions (P less than .01). Factors not associated with hypertension included the rate of rise of the hematocrit, the net rise in hematocrit, age, sex, the number of years on dialysis, the presence or absence of kidneys, smoking, or the presence of pretreatment hypertension. Noninvasive hemodynamic studies in eight normotensive patients before and after improvement of the anemia demonstrated a normalization of the decreased peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction toward normal in the elevated cardiac output. In three of these patients, clinical hypertension subsequently evolved. Follow-up hemodynamic studies in nine other patients receiving new or additional antihypertensive medications were difficult to interpret. Although the hypertension can be controlled with routine medication, hypertensive encephalopathy may occur if the blood pressure increases rapidly when the hematocrit increases with rHuEpo therapy.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated the genomic sequence of human interleukin-9 (IL-9) based on its sequence homology with a human IL-9 cDNA isolated from human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed T cells by expression cloning. The entire genomic sequence has been determined and the gene consists of five exons and four introns. The human IL-9 gene is mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5 at band 5q31-32, a region found to be deleted in a number of patients with acquired 5q- abnormalities and hematologic disorders. Several blocks of transcriptional control sequences have been identified at the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene that may play an important role in the control of IL-9 gene expression. The 5'-regulatory region of the human IL-9 gene also contains sequences identified in the 5'-flanking regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and other T-cell growth factor genes including IL-2 and IL-6. The IL-9 gene is constitutively expressed in the HTLV-I-transformed human T cells and the expression of IL-9 in these cells can be further induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. Transient transfection analysis using the plasmid containing the 5'-flanking region of IL-9 gene upstream from the firefly luciferase ciferase report gene indicated that the 0.9-kb Smal-Sacl fragment of the IL-9 gene contains sequences required for the constitutive and activated expression of IL-9 gene in HTLV-I-transformed cells. These results will now allow us to study the regulatory mechanism of IL-9 gene expression in normal and leukemic human T cells.\r"

Although erythroid (BFU-E and CFU-E) and granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors are infected with this virus, only erythropoiesis is impaired. Two to 3 weeks before the onset of anemia, CFU-E become undetectable in marrow cultures while earlier erythroid progenitors (BFU-E) persist, suggesting that FeLV-C/Sarma (presumably via its envelope glycoprotein gp70) inhibits the differentiation of BFU-E to CFU-E in vivo. To correlate in vitro observations with the progression of disease, prospective studies were performed in six cats. These studies showed that at the time that the frequencies of CFU-E decreased in marrow cultures, BFU-E no longer responded to hematopoietic growth factor(s), although the responses of CFU-GM were unchanged. In further studies, anemic cats received suramin, a reverse-transcriptase inhibitor with other diverse effects. Within 4 to 14 days, erythropoiesis improved and up to 1,616 CFU-E were detected per 10(5) marrow mononuclear cells. However, progenitor cells remained infected, suggesting that suramin modulated erythroid differentiation without inhibiting progenitor infection. These observations led to the hypothesis that the gp70 of FeLV-C/Sarma impairs BFU-E differentiation by interference with ligand/receptor interactions or signal transduction pathways unique to erythroid cells. Understanding this mechanism should provide insights into the interactions controlling early erythropoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for autoantibody-associated cross-reactive idiotypes (CRIs) of Waldenstrom's IgM react frequently with the surface Ig (slg) expressed by leukemia cells of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Evaluation of the molecular basis for this cross-reactivity indicates that such CRIs are encoded by conserved antibody variable region genes (V genes) that have undergone little or no somatic hypermutation. We find that such anti-CRI MoAbs stain a subpopulation of cells within the mantle zones surrounding the germinal centers of normal human tonsil. In contrast, MoAbs specific for variable region subgroup determinants react with cells in both the mantle zones and germinal centers of secondary B-cell follicles. To test whether mantle zone B cells not reactive with existing anti-CRI MoAbs may express slg bearing as-yet-unrecognized CRIs present on Igs produced by neoplastic cells of some patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or CLL, we immunized mice with purified Waldenstrom's IgM that have been characterized for their variable region subgroups using subgroup-specific antisera raised against synthetic peptides. The supernatants of hybridomas generated from the splenocytes of immunized mice were screened for their ability to stain a subpopulation of mantle zone lymphocytes in human tonsil. With this approach, two new anti-CRI MoAbs were identified, designated OAK1 and VOH3. OAK1 binds to a CRI present on a subset of kappa light chains of the VK1 subgroup. VOH3 recognizes a CRI determinant(s) present on a subset of antibody heavy chains of the VH3 subgroup. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that OAK1 specifically binds leukemia cells from 5 to 20 patients (25%) with kappa light chain expressing CLL. In addition, VOH3 reacted with the leukemia cells from 1 of 17 (6%) patients tested. The success of these methods demonstrates that the variable regions of the Igs produced by mantle zone B cells share idiotypic determinants with Igs expressed in B-cell CLL (B-CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.\r"

We isolated and blood-perfused lungs of 30 rats (480 +/- 21 g). Group 1 (n = 7) was untreated, group 2 (n = 8) was paralyzed with papaverine, group 3 (n = 11) was treated with indomethacin, and group 4 (n = 4) was treated with indomethacin and U60257, a putative lipoxygenase inhibitor. Blood flow was adjusted initially to raise pulmonary artery pressure to approximately 15 cm H2O and then held constant. Airway and left atrial pressures were held constant at 7 and 8 cm H2O, respectively (zone 3 conditions). In all lungs, we measured pressures in subpleural 20-50-microns-diameter arterioles and venules using the micropuncture servonull technique. Thus, the pulmonary circulation was partitioned into three segments: arteries, microvessels, and veins. In group 1 lungs, arteries presented the largest fractional resistance to flow at 46% of total resistance, with microvessels and veins contributing 34% and 20%, respectively. In group 2 lungs that had no vasomotor tone, total vascular resistance was approximately 27% lower than in group 1 lungs, mainly due to a lower resistance in veins. In indomethacin-treated lungs (group 3) and indomethacin and U60257-treated lungs (group 4), total and segmental vascular resistance was not significantly different from untreated lungs (group 1). We conclude that in isolated perfused rat lungs, arteries are the predominant site of resistance to blood flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The role of cytochrome P-450 in the myogenic response of isolated, perfused renal arcuate arteries of dogs to elevations in transmural pressure was examined. The phospholipase A2 inhibitor oleyloxyethylphosphorylcholine (1 and 10 microM) inhibited the greater than threefold increase in active wall tension in these arteries after an elevation in perfusion pressure from 80 to 160 mm Hg. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity with indomethacin (1 or 10 microM) had no effect on this response. The cytochrome P-450 inhibitors ketoconazole (10 and 100 microM) and beta-diethyl-aminoethyldiphenylpropylacetate (SKF 525A, 10 and 100 microM) also inhibited the myogenic response. At a pressure of 160 mm Hg, SKF 525A (10 microM) and ketoconazole (100 microM) reduced active wall tension in renal arteries by approximately 70%. Partial inhibition of the myogenic response was obtained after perfusion of the vessels with mechanism-based inhibitors of P-450, 1-aminobenzotriazole (75 microM) and 12-hydroxy-16-heptadecynoic acid (20 microM). The thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29,548 (1 or 10 microM) had no effect on the pressure-induced increase in active wall tension in renal arteries. Arachidonic acid (50 microM) constricted isolated perfused renal arteries and potentiated the myogenic response in the presence of indomethacin. This response was completely reversed by ketoconazole (100 microM) or SKF 525A (100 microM). Microsomes (1 mg/ml) prepared from small renal arteries (200-500 microns) and incubated with [1-14C]arachidonic acid (0.5 mu Ci, 50 microM) produced a metabolite that coeluted with 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) during reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The formation of this product was inhibited by both ketoconazole and SKF 525A at concentrations of 10 and 100 microM. These results are consistent with the involvement of the vasoconstrictor 20-HETE and other cytochrome P-450 metabolites of endogenous fatty acids in the myogenic response.\r"

BW 755C (25 microM), a dual cyclooxygenase/lipoxygenase inhibitor, did not modify the vasodilator effect of AA, whereas 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (10 microM), which blocks all pathways of AA metabolism, abolished AA-induced vasodilation, thus suggesting the involvement of nonlipoxygenase AA metabolites. Clotrimazole (0.7 microM) and 7-ethoxyresorufin (1 microM), both considered to be specific inhibitors of the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase enzymes, inhibited the vasodilator effect, suggesting that AA-induced renal vasodilation is mediated by one or more cytochrome P-450-derived AA metabolites. None of these interventions affected the vasodilator responses to acetylcholine (100 ng) and nitroprusside (1 microgram). Denudation of the endothelium with CHAPS (10 mg/l) reduced the vasodilator responses to AA, suggesting a requirement of an intact endothelium, whereas inhibition of guanylate cyclase with methylene blue (10(-4) M) was without effect, suggesting that cGMP was not involved in the vasodilator response to AA. The AA-induced renal vasodilation was accompanied by the generation of biologically active material or materials released into the renal effluent, which relaxed endothelium-intact and endothelium-denuded rings of isolated aorta and mesenteric and celiac arteries of the rabbit. These results suggest that in the rat kidney, AA is metabolized by endothelial cytochrome P-450-dependent enzymes to vasodilator metabolites.\r"

Although the somatomotor responses are generally regarded as \"behavior,\" the cardiovascular adjustments that accompany these responses are generally considered to be reflexes that are elicited by neurally mediated stimuli and metabolites arising from working muscles. We report experimental evidence that monkeys can be trained to exercise, to slow heart rate, and to combine these two skills. Furthermore, some animals will emit more physical work at slower heart rates (at comparable levels of cardiac output) and lower left ventricular work during the combined condition relative to an exercise-only condition. Thus, these findings show that the cardiovascular and somatomotor responses of exercise can be dissociated and that both sets of responses should be considered behaviors. Also included are results that show these animals can perform these behaviors during sympathetic or vagal blockade. These findings are further evidence that the cardiovascular adjustments to exercise are, in part, learned behaviors because they show that the behavior--attenuation of the tachycardia of exercise--is not a reflex that is specifically tied to any neuroeffector system; rather, this behavior is emitted to achieve a contingent reward, and the nervous system will use whatever mechanisms are available to attain that consequence.\r"

The characteristics of RF associated with RA are as follows. They are of all Ig isotypes (not just IgM), indicating T-cell participation in antibody maturation. They have higher avidity for human IgG than for rabbit IgG. They use the human germline heavy-chain variable region (VH) gene VHIII more frequently than other VH genes, and light chains from multiple families. (In contrast, monoclonal RFs use predominantly VH1 and very commonly the V kappa IIIb germline gene HUMkv325). RA IgG is somatically mutated. (In contrast, monoclonal RFs use unmutated germline Ig genes). This suggests they are matured by stimulation either with specific antigens or other activation signals such as cytokines. They are abnormally glycosylated. In general, during periods of disease activity in adult and juvenile RA, a galactose is missing from the Fc of the IgG molecule, leaving an empty \"pocket\" between the C gamma 2 domains of heavy chains. The IgG RFs self-associate. This may result at least in part when galactose on the F(ab')2 portion of one IgG molecule fills the empty pocket in the Fc of another Ig molecule. Self-association forms immune complexes capable of fixing complement and probably of causing joint damage and vasculitis.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized study in 26 elderly patients with mild essential hypertension, acute effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on plasma ANP levels were examined at rest and during ergometric exercise. Plasma ANP level and LVEF were measured before and after administration of prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker), atenolol (a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker), or carteolol (a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker). Plasma ANP level was increased by exercise. Carteolol and atenolol increased plasma ANP levels at rest and during exercise, but the effect of atenolol was not statistically significant. Prazosin significantly suppressed the ANP values at rest and during exercise. The LVEF was increased by prazosin and decreased by beta-blockers, especially by carteolol. Multivariate regression analysis showed that LVEF was the most significant predictor of the plasma ANP level at maximal exercise; the resting blood pressure and heart rate were not predictors of this value. The results showed that single administrations of an alpha-blocker and a nonselective beta-blocker had opposite effects on the plasma ANP level both at rest and during exercise in elderly patients with mild essential hypertension. The observed difference in the ANP response seems to be related to changes in left ventricular function rather than changes in blood pressure or heart rate.\r"

Seventy cases of tuberculous pleural effusion were identified and constituted 4.9 percent of all disease due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during this period. Tuberculous pleural effusion was diagnosed if the patient had M tuberculosis cultured from sputum, pleura, or pleural fluid and had a roentgenographic pleural effusion without an alternative explanation for the presence of the effusion. The diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion was made in the absence of a positive culture if the patient had an undiagnosed lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion and all clinical and roentgenographic abnormalities resolved on antimycobacterial chemotherapy. The mean age of all patients was 47 +/- 18.4 years. The 70 cases were evenly divided between 35 that were accompanied by roentgenographic pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and 35 that occurred in the absence of parenchymal infiltrates. We conclude that cultures of all potentially diagnostic specimens (sputum, pleural fluid, and pleura) and an intermediate-strength skin test, are sensitive tests for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion. In addition, the age of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion appears to be increasing.\r"

To further elucidate this issue, we assessed reproductive endocrine function in 10 normally cycling, drug-free epileptic women and in 5 normal controls, evaluating the basal hormonal profile and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in the midfollicular phase. Luteinizing hormone pulse frequency was significantly higher in epileptic women with a consequent reduction of the LH interpulse interval. We suggest that epilepsy may interfere with the functional activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator. The pathogenetic mechanisms for this phenomenon may be the spreading of paroxysmal activity within the hypothalamic areas or, alternatively, a neurotransmitter dysfunction giving rise both to the seizure disorder and to the abnormal LH pulsatile pattern.\r"

Endometrial biopsy was performed when E2 levels were greater than or equal to 250 pg/mL per follicle and the follicular diameter was greater than or equal to 17 mm. As controls, we studied 20 preovulatory endometrial biopsies from patients with a male infertility factor. The biopsy material was examined at light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopes, and a morphometric analysis was performed. Preovulatory endometrial mucosa during controlled ovarian hyperstimulation showed accentuated proliferative aspects in both the glandular and stromal components and more frequent early secretory phenomena compared with the controls. The preovulatory progesterone (P) levels observed in our study seem to exclude the possibility that such early secretory aspects of the hyperstimulated endometrium are because of higher P concentrations in patients compared with controls.\r"

Eleven (57.9%) users had persistent follicles, and 2 users (10.5%) had no follicular development. These data suggest that after 2 to 4 years of use, about one third of Norplant users with regular bleeding patterns may ovulate but most have deficient luteal P levels.

Follicle-stimulating hormone level was a better predictor than age for all outcome variables examined and remained a significant predictor after accounting for age, etiology of infertility, and semen quality. The combined use of age and basal FSH in counseling patients improves the accuracy of prognosis, and may provide an index of functional ovarian reserve (\"ovarian age\").\r"

A separate group of thawed embryos cryopreserved after down regulation in 21 patients was compared with embryos frozen after conventional stimulation during the same period from 21 other patients. Eleven morphological criteria were assessed in the fresh embryos, and analyses did not reveal any differences between the groups studied. However, the rate of development of embryos obtained during down-regulated cycles was significantly higher than that of embryos developing in conventional stimulation cycles. Although no significant morphological differences could be shown between the groups of cryopreserved embryos, there was a decreased incidence of implantation of embryos from patients who were exposed to analogs. It is suggested that embryos from down-regulated cycles should be cryopreserved earlier to correct for their accelerated development.\r"

In CC + hMG-treated patients, an endogenous LH surge occurred systematically 4.25 +/- 2.75 hours after hCG injection. Multiparametric analysis indicated an inverse correlation between the delay in the initial rise of the LH surge and the increase in P levels during the 6 hours after hCG administration. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist + hMG treatment did not lead to an LH surge after hCG but to a significant fall in LH levels. Thus, exogenous hCG, administered before ovulation, induces an endogenous LH surge if pituitary function is not blocked by a GnRH-a, probably through an increase in P secretion.\r"

The cell populations involved in the expression of diabetes are not precisely known but probably include natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and T lymphocytes. Because the DP rat has few lymphocytes of the CD5+/CD+ phenotype, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Tc) are not believed to be important in the process. Diabetes-resistant (DR) BB rats that are depleted of RT6+ T lymphocytes also become diabetic and provide an additional model of IDDM. We report that diabetes in DR rats depleted of RT6+ T lymphocytes is prevented by the concomitant depletion of either the CD5+ or the CD8+ population. In contrast, coadministration of anti-asialogangliosideM1 (alpha-ASGM1), an antiserum that principally recognizes NK cells, failed to prevent hyperglycemia in RT6-depleted rats. We propose that the initiation of diabetes in both DP and RT6-depleted DR rats is T-lymphocyte dependent. However, the final common pathway leading to autoimmune beta-cell destruction in IDDM may be different in these models. The RT6-depleted DR rat requires a cell that is sensitive to anti-CD8 (possibly a Tc), whereas the DP rat requires an anti-ASGM1-sensitive cell.\r"

Therefore, it is predictable that changes in the T-lymphocyte repertoire of diabetes-prone mice occur and predispose them to disease. We demonstrate here that an altered (with respect to control BALB/cJ mice) thymic T-lymphocyte maturation reflected by a depletion (approximately 12%) of CD4+CD8+ T lymphocytes and a reciprocal increase in CD4-CD8- T lymphocytes precedes the onset of diabetes. This depletion was detected only approximately 3 mo after insulitis and is manifested by a specific loss (approximately 3%) of immature T lymphocytes bearing V beta 8lo (lo is a relative level of expression) T-lymphocyte receptor. By onset of diabetes, an even greater decrease (approximately 35%) of CD4+CD8+ and a reciprocal increase of CD4-CD8- T lymphocytes were apparent and accompanied by the same depletion (3%) of V beta 8 lo T lymphocytes. Administration of cyclophosphamide (CY), which accelerates the appearance of diabetes in NOD mice, caused similar depletions of CD4+CD8+ and V beta 8lo thymic T lymphocytes. The same alterations in the distribution of these thymic T-lymphocyte subsets were evident even earlier in insulitis- and diabetes-free NON mice, indicating that these changes in thymic T-lymphocyte development may be necessary but not sufficient to give rise to diabetes. Despite the common genetic origin of NOD and NON mice, differences at their MHC-linked and -unlinked loci may account for their differential susceptibility to diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Activities of alpha-2/alpha-3 and alpha-6-L-fucosyltransferases were all significantly greater in plasma from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma than in plasma from cirrhotic patients or normal subjects (p less than 0.025). The activity of each enzyme was dependent, to a similar extent, on Mn2+, Mg2+ and triton X-10, irrespective of the source, and all displayed pH optimums in the range of 7.5 to 8.0. In contrast, activities of alpha-2/alpha-3 fucosyltransferases were significantly lower (p less than 0.025) in homogenates prepared from tumorous liver tissue than in that prepared from nontumorous tissue from hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic patients, whereas for the alpha-6 enzyme the situation was reversed (typically, tumor tissue levels were 5 pmol/hr/mg; in nontumor tissue they were 2 pmol/hr/mg). Activities of galactosyl and mannosyltransferase in tumor tissue were greater in all cases than in nontumor cirrhotic tissue. Plasma fucosyltransferases are specifically elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma but different mechanisms appear to underlie the changes seen for alpha-2/alpha-3 and alpha-6-L-fucosyltransferases.\r"

The two groups were compared for incidence of complications, recurrence of massive ascites after hospital dismissal and survival rate. The incidence of complications traditionally related to paracentesis, the probability of requiring readmission to the hospital for ascites (p = 0.48) and the probability of survival after entry into the study (p = 0.85) were the same for the two groups. A multivariate analysis of 16 parameters, including treatment modality, identified absolute unresponsiveness to diuretics as the only independent predictor of mortality. These results indicate that hemaccel infusion may safely replace albumin infusion after total paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites.\r"

Six of 34 consecutive transplant recipients were found to have had antibodies to hepatitis C before transplantation. All six patients had possible exposure to hepatitis C through blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. Five of the six patients were positive for antibodies to hepatitis C after 1 yr of follow-up. Two of these patients had clinical and histological evidence of acute viral hepatitis in their allografts. In one patient this led to hepatic injury and dysfunction of two successive grafts. In contrast, none of the twenty-eight patients who were seronegative for hepatitis C virus antibodies before transplantation has converted to seropositivity after transplantation despite perioperative blood transfusions. These results suggest that hepatitis C diagnosed serologically recurs in a minority of transplant recipients and that de novo seroconversion must be uncommon.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in local brain stem perfusion that alter extracellular fluid Pco2 and/or [H+] near central chemoreceptors may contribute to the decrease in respiration observed during hypoxia after peripheral chemoreceptor denervation and to the delayed decrease observed during hypoxia in the newborn. In this study, we measured the changes in respiration and brain stem blood flow (BBF) during 2-4 min of hypoxic hypoxia in both intact and denervated piglets and calculated the changes in brain stem Pco2 and [H+] that would be expected to occur as a result of the changes in BBF. All animals were anesthetized, spontaneously breathing, and between 2 and 7 days of age. Respiratory and other variables were measured before and during hypoxia in all animals, and BBF (microspheres) was measured in a subgroup of intact and denervated animals at 0, 30, and 260 s and at 0 and 80 s, respectively. During hypoxia, minute ventilation increased and then decreased (biphasic response) in the intact animals but decreased only in the denervated animals. BBF increased in a near linear fashion, and calculated brain stem extracellular fluid Pco2 and [H+] decreased over the first 80 s both before and after denervation. We speculate that a rapid increase in BBF during acute hypoxia decreases brain stem extracellular fluid Pco2 and [H+], which, in turn, negatively modulate the increase in respiratory drive produced by peripheral chemoreceptor input to the central respiratory generator.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of the endothelial cell-derived peptide endothelin 1 was investigated in human skin. Intradermal injection of endothelin 1 (1-100 pmol) caused a dose-dependent area of pallor that was associated with a significant reduction in basal skin blood flow, measured by laser-Doppler blood flowmeter (with 1 pmol endothelin, P = 0.012, analysis of variance). The coadministration of endothelin 1 (1-100 pmol) with the neuropeptide vasodilator calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) inhibited the vasodilator response to CGRP (10 pmol) by up to 82.7 +/- 9.2% (with 100 pmol endothelin, P less than 0.001). The response of the prostanoid vasodilator prostaglandin E2 (10 pmol) was inhibited by endothelin in a similar manner. In addition to the vasoconstrictor effects, endothelin 1 produced a dose-dependent flare that surrounded the area of pallor, and this was associated with a significant increase in blood flow (P less than 0.05) within the flare area. The H1 antagonist terfenadine (120 mg po) significantly reduced the flare area associated with endothelin 1: flare 5 min after intradermal endothelin (10 pmol, placebo treated), 668 +/- 405 mm2; terfenadine treated, 201 +/- 257 mm2 (P less than 0.05). The flare was also significantly attenuated when endothelin (10 pmol) was injected into local anesthetic-treated skin. Thus intradermal injection of endothelin in humans causes long-lasting vasoconstriction at the site of injection and a surrounding flare. Results suggest that the flare component is partially histamine dependent and the result of an axon reflex. This study demonstrates the potent activity of endothelin in human skin. It is possible that endothelin could be relevant to the local response of skin to injury.\r"

To investigate the neural and humoral pathways mediating the response of tracheal ciliary beat frequency (CBF) to topically applied SP, CBF was measured on the ventral midtracheal surface of anesthetized beagles by using heterodyne-mode correlation analysis laser light scattering. In the first study, aerosolized SP, delivered to the lungs of eight beagle dogs, stimulated CBF in a dose-dependent manner from a baseline of 4.9 +/- 0.4 Hz to a maximum of 14.9 +/- 1.5 Hz at dose of 10(-7) M. In the second study, the tracheal lumen was isolated from the bronchial airways by inflating the cuff of an endotracheal tube near the carina. Intravenous hexamethonium bromide (2 mg/kg), ipratropium bromide (0.5 micrograms/kg), and indomethacin (2 mg/kg) were used as blocking agents to inhibit the nicotinic, muscarinic, and cyclooxygenase pathways, respectively. Aerosolized 10(-9), 10(-8), or 10(-7) M SP was delivered sequentially to the tracheal lumen for 3 min at 30-min intervals. SP caused two distinct CBF stimulatory episodes at 4 min (mean time of the maximal response) and at 18 min (mean time of the maximal response) after onset of delivery and returned to baseline after 25 min. SP stimulated CBF from the baseline of 5.1 +/- 0.4 Hz to a maximum of 14.2 +/- 2.5 Hz during the first episode (P less than 0.01) and to 10.4 +/- 0.6 Hz during the second episode (P less than 0.01) at dose of 10(-8) M. These responses were inhibited by all the blocking agents. These data suggest that SP stimulates CBF via a cyclooxygenase-dependent parasympathetic reflex.\r"

Compared with ZEEP, MV with PEEP was associated with a reduction in diuresis (V) from 208 +/- 51 to 68 +/- 11 ml/h (P less than 0.02), in natriuresis (UNa) from 12.4 +/- 3.3 to 6.2 +/- 2.1 mmol/h (P less than 0.02), and in fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) from 1.07 +/- 0.02), 0.21 to 0.67 +/- 0.17% (P less than 0.02) and with an increase in plasma renin activity (PRA) from 4.83 +/- 1.53 to 7.85 +/- 3.02 ng.ml-1.h-1 (P less than 0.05). Plasma ANF levels markedly decreased during PEEP in four patients but showed only minor changes in the other four patients, and mean plasma ANF levels did not change (163 +/- 33 pg/ml during ZEEP and 126 +/- 30 pg/ml during PEEP). Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were unchanged. Infusion of ANF (5 ng.kg-1.min-1) during PEEP markedly increased V and UNa by 110 +/- 61 and 107 +/- 26%, respectively, whereas PRA decreased from 7.85 +/- 3.02 to 4.40 +/- 1.5 ng.ml-1.min-1 (P less than 0.05).

  ".W": "We report that nucleic acid sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone for a rabbit serum amyloid A (SAA)-like protein has identified this protein as more closely related to SAA3 than to SAA1. SAA3 induced collagenase synthesis in rabbit synovial fibroblasts, and immune IgG raised against this SAA protein abrogated the induction. Using antisera to immunoprecipitate biosynthetically labeled 3H-SAA and 3H-collagenase from culture medium, we compared the levels of SAA and collagenase synthesized by cultures of rabbit fibroblasts at early passage (passages 3-6) with those synthesized by late passage cells (passage 16). Comparatively high levels of both proteins were produced constitutively by fibroblasts at low passage. With increasing passage, levels of both proteins drop so that by passage 16, constitutive production of SAA and collagenase was only approximately 15-20% that of passage 3 cells. Cells at low passage could be readily stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or interleukin 1 (IL-1) to synthesize increased amounts of both SAA and collagenase. In passage 5 cells treated with PMA, we detected increased SAA mRNA by 1.5 h and collagenase mRNA by 5 h. However, older passage cells were more refractory to stimulation and required longer induction times. We suggest that SAA3 may be expressed by fibroblasts at sites of acute inflammation or injury, and that elevated levels of SAA3 may signify \"activated\" fibroblasts which are already producing increased amounts of collagenase constitutively and which are predisposed to further stimulation.\r"

Allele frequencies were calculated for the 2 MS patient groups and compared with those found in a control population from the same geographical location and of similar ethnic background. No significant association was found between MS and the 7 CH region polymorphisms examined. However, a significant correlation between the MS phenotype and a VH2 family polymorphism was observed in both MS patient populations (familial MS patients chi 2 = 8.16, P less than 0.005; sporadic MS patients chi 2 = 8.90, P less than 0.005). One allele of the VH2-5 gene segment was found to be over-represented in both MS groups. VH2-5 has recently been physically mapped close to the CH region, between 180 and 360 kb away. These results indicate that a locus near or within the CH-proximal VH region is associated with increased susceptibility to MS.\r"

To investigate the effect of postmenopausal hormone therapy on atherogenesis, we studied 75 cholesterol-fed female rabbits for 19 wk. The rabbits were randomly assigned to five groups. Four groups underwent bilateral ovariectomy followed by treatment with either 17 beta-estradiol, 17 beta-estradiol plus norethisterone acetate, 17 beta-estradiol plus levonorgestrel, or placebo. The fifth group had a sham operation and received placebo. The hormone groups had only one-third of the aortic accumulation of cholesterol found in the placebo groups, a difference that was highly statistically significant (P less than 0.0001). No significant differences in aortic accumulation of cholesterol were found in the hormone groups. This indicates that estrogen attenuates atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed ovariectomized rabbits and that two commonly prescribed progestogens do not counteract the effect. The beneficial effect of estradiol could only partly be explained by its lowering effects on serum total cholesterol or VLDL cholesterol, which implies that estradiol possesses additional beneficial effects, possibly a direct action on the arterial wall.\r"

Oral administration of vanadate (0.25 mg/ml in the drinking water) to ob/ob mice for 3 wk lowered blood glucose level from 236 +/- 4 to 143 +/- 2 mg/dl without effect on body weight. Administration of vanadate to db/db mice produced a similar effect. Electron microscopic examination revealed no signs of hepatotoxicity after 47 d of treatment. There was a slight reduction in insulin receptor autophosphorylation when tested by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibody after in vivo stimulation, and the phosphorylation of the endogenous substrate of the insulin receptor, pp185, was markedly decreased in the ob/ob mice. Both cytosolic and particulate PTPase activities in liver of ob/ob mice measured by dephosphorylation of a 32P-labeled peptide corresponding to the major site of insulin receptor autophosphorylation were decreased by approximately 50% (P less than 0.01). In db/db diabetic mice, PTPase activity in the cytosolic fraction was decreased to 53% of control values (P less than 0.02) with no significant difference in the particulate PTPase activity. Treatment with vanadate did not alter hepatic PTPase activity as assayed in vitro, or receptor and substrate phosphorylation as assayed in vivo, in ob/ob mice despite its substantial effect on blood glucose. These data indicate that vanadate is an effective oral hypoglycemic treatment in NIDDM states and suggest that its major effects occurs distal to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase.\r"

  ".W": "Using a specific radioimmunoassay for human brain natriuretic peptide (hBNP) with a monoclonal antibody, we have investigated its synthesis, secretion, and clearance in comparison with those of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in normal subjects and patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Mean BNP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) levels in normal atrium and ventricle were 250 and 18 pmol/g, respectively. The plasma BNP-LI level in normal subjects was 0.90 +/- 0.07 fmol/ml, which was 16% of the ANP-LI level. In contrast, the plasma BNP-LI level markedly increased in patients with CHF in proportion to its severity, and surpassed the ANP-LI level in severe cases. There was a significant step-up of the plasma BNP-LI level in the coronary sinus (CS) compared with that in the aortic root (Ao) and the difference between these BNP-LI levels, delta(CS-Ao)BNP, also increased with the severity of CHF. In addition, the step-up of the BNP-LI level in the anterior interventricular vein [delta(AIV-Ao)BNP] was comparable to delta(CS-Ao)BNP, indicating that BNP is secreted mainly from the ventricle. Predominant BNP synthesis in the ventricle was also confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Catheterization and pharmacokinetic studies revealed that hBNP is cleared from the circulation more slowly than alpha-hANP; this was in part attributed to lower (about 7%) binding affinity of hBNP to clearance receptors than that of alpha-hANP. A predominant molecular form of BNP-LI in the heart and plasma was a 3-kD form corresponding to hBNP. These results indicate that BNP is a novel cardiac hormone secreted predominantly from the ventricle, and that the synthesis, secretion and clearance of BNP differ from those of ANP, suggesting discrete physiological and pathophysiological roles of BNP in a dual natriuretic peptide system.\r"

One of the critical steps in the pathway is the passage of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate through the membrane into the cytoplasm. Utilizing both probenecid and low temperature as selective inhibitors, we have successfully blocked transmembrane movement of the vitamin into the cytoplasm without affecting binding to the receptor or the internalization of the vitamin-receptor complex, which suggests that passage is through an anion carrier. This anion carrier, which mediates inward movement of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate after it dissociates from the receptor, also appears to mediate the efflux of folylmonoglutamate, but not folylpolyglutamate, when the concentration of the former in the cytoplasm is sufficiently high. Since we also found that the synthesis of folylpolyglutamates is regulated in these cells, most likely the intracellular concentration of the vitamin is controlled by regulating the flux of folylmonoglutamate through this carrier.\r"

CD8+ cells from 17 of 19 (89%) of these subjects suppressed replication at an E/T ratio of 0.10 or less. CD8+ lymphocytes from symptomatic patients (non-AIDS) inhibited HIV-1 replication at E/T ratios ranging from 0.05 to 1.0, and CD8+ cells from 8 of 13 (62%) required ratios greater than 0.10. As a group, patients with AIDS exhibited the lowest degree of anti-HIV activity with their CD8+ lymphocytes. The effective range of E/T ratios from AIDS patients was 0.10-2.0, and 9 of 10 (90%) required E/T ratios greater than 0.25. This anti-HIV activity exhibited by CD8+ cells also correlated significantly with the subject's peripheral blood CD4+ cell count. The relative extent of CD8+ cell anti-HIV-1 activity was not found dependent on variations in the CD4+ target cells and viruses used. These findings suggest that the decreased CD8+ cell antiviral activity is related to progression to disease in HIV-infected individuals.\r"

Multiple logistic regression was used to determine if nursing home quality indices increased the prediction of these outcomes when patient severity of illness and case-mix differences were in the model. Three hundred ninety veterans discharged to 11 nursing homes were followed for 6 months. Nursing home quality was assessed using indices from the Multiphasic Environmental Assessment Procedure and the Rush-Medicus Methodology for Monitoring Quality of Nursing Care. An increased likelihood of death was associated with the diagnoses of cancer and heart disease and with being rehospitalized. Four nursing home quality indices significantly improved the prediction of mortality (RN hours, nursing process, security, and mean quality). Rehospitalization was associated with the patient factors of heart disease, hypertension, race, and level of care and with size of the nursing home. Discharge from the facility was inversely associated with the diagnosis of cancer and directly related to the index of nursing process. The results support the notion that group outcomes may be related to nursing home quality and suggest the need for further studies to investigate the specific elements of nursing home quality which relate to improved outcome.\r"

A carefully matched set of 1,327 Medicaid patients from 95 non-participating homes in the same areas of Massachusetts was compared to 1,324 Medicaid demonstration patients from 75 homes. Information came from specially designed record reviews and the Medicaid and Medicare information systems. Separate analyses were done for newly admitted cases and rollovers. Comparisons of quality of care suggested that the medical groups using NPs and PAs provided as good or better care than did the physicians in the control group. There were no differences in functional status changes or in the use of medications. The demonstration patients received more attention, as reflected in more orders written and an average of one additional visit a month. Demonstration patients showed higher scores on three of seven specially designed quality tracers, congestive heart failure and hypertension for both new administrations and rollovers, and new urinary incontinence for new admissions. Rollovers had significantly fewer emergency and total hospital days. A cost analysis suggests that the use of NPs and PAs saves at least as much as it costs and may save additional money with more sustained use.\r"

Infectious HIV was detected in the plasma of all patients, in most cases at high titers, before IFN-alpha treatment. There was no correlation between HIV titers and p24 antigen levels. Antiviral activity, as measured by significantly decreased levels of infectious virus or p24 antigen, was observed in six of eight completely treated but in only one of nine incompletely treated patients. After termination of IFN-alpha treatment, there was a significant rise of p24 antigen levels. During IFN treatment, absolute CD4 cell counts showed a tendency toward an increased rate of decline. The side effects were unexpectedly severe. Despite its anti-HIV effect in vivo, IFN-alpha in the dosages used does not seem to be a viable additional treatment for severely immunodeficient patients in ongoing AZT therapy.\r"

The restriction endonuclease digestion patterns of isolates from Connecticut, Massachusetts, Lebanon, and Argentina were all markedly different, indicating that these were different strains. However, isolates from Delaware, Texas, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia and Pittsburgh), Florida, and Virginia were similar, indicating that these isolates were derivatives of a single strain. This conclusion was supported by hybridization using individual fragments as probes. Spread of Bla+ enterococci within the hospital setting was also demonstrated. These findings illustrate the value of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for epidemiologic analyses and support the importance of identifying and containing organisms with new resistance properties in an effort to decrease their transmission to and from, as well as within, hospitals.\r"

Brain edema occurred only with strains A anc C, with no association with disease severity; intracranial hypertension was also independent of disease severity. Strain B, not C, achieved the highest bacterial titers in the CSF (P less than .005). The widely different abilities of strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae to induce intracranial abnormalities suggest that virulence determinants affect not only evasion of defense during colonization and invasion, as shown in other models, but also determine the course of disease once infection has been established. Differences of cell-wall metabolism among pneumococcal strains may play a role in this latter phase of the development of meningitis.\r"

In this assay, 5 x 10(4) conidia that had germinated into hyphae were exposed to 5 x 10(5), 15 x 10(5), or 50 x 10(5) CGD neutrophils. By analysis of variance, neutrophils from patients on rIFN-gamma were found to produce significantly more damage to hyphae than those from the placebo group (P less than .01). In subgroup analysis, this effect was best seen in the hyphae exposed to 50 x 10(5) CGD neutrophils, where neutrophils from patients receiving rIFN-gamma produced significantly more damage to the hyphae than those from the placebo group (P less than .05). In vivo rIFN-gamma therapy improves the ability of CGD neutrophils to damage Aspergillus fumigatus hyphae in an in vitro assay.\r"

Serum TNF alpha levels were also not elevated in 15 normal volunteers (11.3 +/- 15.6 pg/ml) and in 10 patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (19.1 +/- 10.8 pg/ml). Leishmanial infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages enhanced the basal TNF alpha production by these cells, and this effect was further potentiated by treatment with recombinant interferon-gamma. After effective treatment of VL patients, serum TNF alpha levels dropped rapidly (129 +/- 112 vs. 9 +/- 13 pg/ml in 10 days), even before clinical parameters such as spleen size or parasitism, white blood cell count, or levels of hemoglobin returned to normal values. On the other hand, patients unresponsive to treatment remained with elevated levels (276 +/- 69 vs. 155 +/- 71 pg/ml in 10 days). Thus, serum TNF alpha levels in VL patients are a good parameter to monitor in determining host response to therapy.\r"

A rapid, reliable, and inexpensive ($5 per test) commercial ELISA was used to test for antibodies to measles; its seroprevalence in the subject population was 86%. From the model, it was estimated that prevaccination serologic testing would be cost-effective if antibody screening cost less than or equal to $12.75 per test. In this subject population, prevaccination serologic screening for measles was cost-effective.\r"

The frequency of developing neutralizing antibody to IFN varied according to the IFN given.

Attempts at developing a convenient method based on differences in chromosomal DNA by detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) have had limited success. This report describes the development of a nonradioactive RFLP technique that differs from most methods by using enzymes that have four base recognition sites rather than six. The restriction enzymes AluI, DdeI, HinfI, NdeII, RsaI, and TaqI were used to digest genomic DNA, and high-molecular-weight fragments were visualized after Southern blotting with digoxigenin-labeled M. tuberculosis DNA. Digestion with AluI resulted in different banding patterns among all eight clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis and three type strains from the tuberculosis complex. NdeII distinguished all but two strains, while HinfI and RsaI were unable to distinguish two pairs of strains. Digestion with the enzymes DdeI and TaqI failed to result in clearly discernible bands. These preliminary results suggest that this method provides a fine differentiation of M. tuberculosis strains and may be useful as an epidemiologic tool.\r"

Invasive aspergillosis in CGD patients is particularly virulent and has a mortality rate of approximately 50%. A patient with autosomal recessive CGD was identified who had progressive pulmonary aspergillosis that was unresponsive to conventional antifungal therapy. She was treated with recombinant human interferon-gamma (rHuIFN-gamma) and had a dramatic improvement in clinical symptoms, sedimentation rate, and radiographic scans. No consistent improvement in bactericidal function or neutrophil oxidative capacity could be demonstrated. However, serum neopterin levels, a measure of macrophage activation, increased in a dose-dependent manner with rHuIFN-gamma therapy; increased levels mirrored the improved clinical parameters. This patient's treatment illustrates the usefulness of the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) gallium scan for following pulmonary inflammatory lesions in the presence of fibrosis and indicates that rHuIFN-gamma may be of benefit to CGD patients with serious infections unresponsive to conventional therapy.\r"

The 6250 neutralizing units given 24 and 96 h after infection reproducibly increased mortality (P less than .05). Histology sections showed markedly more nests of T. cruzi in treated mice. BALB/c, Swiss Webster, C57Bl/6, and C3H/HEN mice were susceptible to the effects of anti-IFN-gamma. Peritoneal macrophages from mice 4 days after infection and a single dose of 6250 units of anti-IFN-gamma had significantly reduced ability to inhibit T. cruzi multiplication. Multiple doses of anti-IFN-gamma delayed but did not prevent macrophage activation. These results indicate the critical role of endogenous IFN-gamma for macrophage activation and host defense against acute T. cruzi infection in mice.\r"

Sympathetic activity was assessed by the spillover of norepinephrine into plasma. Turnover of norepinephrine was assessed by the plasma concentration of its intraneuronal metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). In normal subjects the resting plasma concentration of DOPA was 6.05 +/- 0.16 nmol/L (n = 42). Plasma DOPA level was increased by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system; handgrip exercise caused a 0.49 +/- 0.07 nmol/L increase (n = 15), mental stress a 0.25 +/- 0.10 nmol/L increase (n = 34), and coffee drinking a 0.85 +/- 0.19 nmol/L increase (n = 9). Desipramine decreased plasma DOPA level by 0.25 +/- 0.06 nmol/L (n = 23). The small but consistent changes in plasma DOPA level during manipulations of sympathetic activity were positively correlated with changes in norepinephrine spillover (r = 0.55, n = 81) and plasma DHPG level (r = 0.66, n = 81). Percentage increases in plasma DOPA level during sympathetic activation were similar to those in plasma DHPG but were a sixth of the percentage increases in norepinephrine spillover. The similar increases in plasma DOPA and DHPG levels indicated that production of DOPA was related to the turnover of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves. The smaller percentage increases in plasma DOPA (smaller than those in norepinephrine spillover) were consistent with the partial contribution of exocytotic neurotransmitter release to the turnover of norepinephrine in sympathetic nerves.\r"

In vitro, thrombin has been demonstrated to increase PMN adherence to endothelial cells coincident with generation of platelet activating factor (PAF) by endothelial cells. These observations have led to the suggestion that PAF mediates, in part, the attachment of PMNs to endothelial cells. We examined this hypothesis in vivo and in vitro with a specific PAF receptor antagonist, WEB 2086. Prior infusion of WEB 2086 into conscious sheep significantly attenuated the drop in peripheral blood PMN counts observed during and after infusion of alpha-thrombin (30 NIH U/kg). These data suggest that WEB 2086 prevented PMN margination on endothelial cells. WEB 2086 also attenuated the thrombocytopenia seen after thrombin infusion and ameliorated the thrombin-induced hypoxemia and hemoconcentration. WEB 2086 did not affect the thrombin-induced hemodynamic response, the degree of intravascular coagulation as assessed by fibrin degradation product generation, or thromboxane B2 generation. In vitro, WEB 2086 prevented the augmented adherence of sheep PMNs to sheep endothelial cell monolayers after thrombin stimulation. The results of the present study are consistent with the hypothesis that PAF mediates, at least in part, thrombin-induced leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in vivo.\r"

  ".U": "91185979\r", 
  ".W": "We have used 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, a selective inhibitor of oxidized glutathione reductase (GSSG-R), to examine the role of this enzyme in regulating the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) and to explore how a variety of agents influence glucose decarboxylation in intact human red blood cells (RBCs). Substances tested included primaquine and several other drugs that are specially hemolytic and methemoglobinemic in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and related disorders. The results allowed us to distinguish and quantitate contrasting modes of HMS stimulation and to clarify how RBCs respond to different classes of oxidants. Some agents like methylene blue (MB), phenazine methosulfate, and pyrroline carboxylate do not require GSSG-R to increase CO2 production; they activate G6PD and 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase by directly oxidizing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Other compounds, like ascorbate, nitrofurantoin, and doxorubicin, oxidize GSH primarily; CO2 increases indirectly only when GSSG-R, activated by glutathione disulfide (GSSG), raises the level of NADP. Chemicals like primaquine, daunorubicin, and methylphenylazoformate trigger the HMS by independently oxidizing both NADPH and GSH. Unlike MB, most drugs that are hemolytic in G6PD deficiency activate the HMS in a manner that depends to a variable extent on GSSG-R. This variability may explain hitherto puzzling clinical and pharmacogenetic differences between primaquine and diaminodiphenylsulfone-induced hemolysis.\r"

  ".W": "Movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are prominent features of neurological Wilson's disease (WD). This suggests there may be dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. To explore this possibility, five patients were studied using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-6-fluorodopa (6FD), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We calculated striatal 6FD uptake rate constants by a graphical method and compared the results with those of 18 normal subjects. It was found that four patients with symptoms all had abnormally low 6FD uptake, and the one asymptomatic patient had normal uptake. PET evidence for nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction was present even after many years of penicillamine treatment. It is concluded that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is involved in neurological WD.\r"

The second patient, who was comatose and with decerebrate posturing, made a remarkable recovery. Angiography showed reperfusion. Therapy was initiated in the first patient after six hours and in the second after two hours. Treatment with rtPA is promising but probably not feasible for every patient.

  ".W": "Systemic findings such as hepatosplenomegaly and typical Gaucher storage cells in a bone marrow aspirate led to the clinical diagnosis of Gaucher's disease in the seven-year old patient described in this report. On the basis of the lack of neurologic involvement the child was classified as having the Type 1, nonneurologic form of Gaucher's disease. After splenectomy glucocerebrosidase was extracted from her spleen for biochemical analysis. As expected, a marked deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity was evident in the splenic extract, however her enzyme displayed anomalous behavior compared to other identical splenic preparations from documented Type 1 Gaucher's disease patients in that it failed to reconstitute with the acidic lipid phosphatidylserine. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based color complementation assay and restriction endonuclease analysis, we compared the mutation genotype of this child with that of five other classical Type 1 patients. This analysis revealed that our patient alone was homoallelic for a T----C transition at position 1448 in the glucocerebrosidase cDNA that results in a 444Leu----Pro substitution in the glucocerebrosidase protein. The latter mutation genotype is normally associated with the neurologic phenotype, namely, the Types 2 and 3 forms of the disease. The relevance of the nature of polarity in clinical and biochemical analyses is discussed with regard to the phenotypic classification and the future clinical course of disease in the child.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of purified eicosapentanoic acid on intimal fibrous hyperplasia in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts was examined in 18 rabbits undergoing infrarenal aorta reconstruction. Six rabbits received commercial rabbit chow (control group), six a regular diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol (cholesterol group), and six the cholesterol diet with 91.1% pure eicosapentanoic acid 500 mg/day (eicosapentanoic acid group). Grafts were harvested 3 months after surgery for histologic examination. The platelet count and serum beta-thromboglobulin and platelet factor 4 concentrations were not significantly different between groups. Serum arachidonic acid level in the cholesterol group was significantly higher than in the control group, and serum eicosapentanoic acid levels in the eicosapentanoic acid group were significantly higher than in the remaining two groups. Intergroup differences in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and thromboxane B2 concentrations were not significant. Intimal thickness at midgraft was 5.2 +/- 6.2 microns in the control group, 67.6 +/- 46.9 microns in the cholesterol group, and 19.2 +/- 18.4 microns in the eicosapntanoic acid group. intimal thickness in the cholesterol group was greater than in either the control or licosapentanoic acid group (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively). These data suggest that eicosapentanoic acid reduces intimal fibrous proliferation in expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafting as a result of hypercholesterolemia and that this effect is independent of the platelet count, activated platelet factors, and the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 ratio.\r"

Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. All patients had metastatic lesions (mesentery, pleura, colon, cervix, abdominal wall, lung, liver, bladder, and nodes). Toxicity ranged from mild to moderate. All patients experienced alopecia, nausea, and vomiting. Neutropenia and anemia ranged from mild to moderate. One patient experienced mild brain confusion and two patients microscopic hematuria. Ten clinically complete responses (47%) and five clinically partial responses (23%) were registered, for an overall 70% objective response. However, after a second look performance in 10 patients with clinically complete response, six of 10 patients showed a pathological complete response and four showed pathological partial response. The median duration of complete response is about 33 months, and median partial response duration is 14 months. Although the numbers are small, these data indicate that combination chemotherapy with high dose ifosfamide/mesna plus cisplatin may be an active treatment for advanced ovarian carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Of the various classes of antibodies that B lymphocytes can produce, class M (IgM) is the first to be expressed on the membrane of the developing cells. Pre-B cells, the precursors of B-lymphocytes, produce the heavy chain of IgM (mu chain), but not light chains. Recent data suggest that pre-B cells express mu chains on the membrane together with the 'surrogate' light chains lambda 5 and V pre B (refs 2-7). This complex could control pre-B-cell differentiation, in particular the rearrangement of the light-chain genes. We have now assessed the importance of the membrane form of the mu chain in B-cell development by generating mice lacking this chain. We disrupted one of the membrane exons of the gene encoding the mu-chain constant region by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells. From these cells we derived mice heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation. B-cell development in the heterozygous mice seemed to be normal, but in homozygous animals B cells were absent, their development already being arrested at the stage of pre-B-cell maturation.\r"

To evaluate this discrepancy, 21 rabbits were subjected to embolic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) by retrograde injection of a tin-tagged, 2-hour-old autologous clot through the external carotid artery with angiographic monitoring in the same manner as in a previously reported model. The emboli lodged intracranially at the bifurcation of the ICA in 10 animals and in the cervical ICA in 11 animals. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed total occlusion of the ICA in all animals. Treatment started one-half hour after embolization and consisted of a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg of rTPA followed by an infusion of 1 mg/kg/h for 2 hours. All of the animals with intracranial emboli and 6 of the animals with cervical emboli were treated intravenously. The remaining 5 animals with cervical emboli were treated by intracarotid infusion of the same dose of rTPA. In the intravenously treated group, serial digital subtraction angiography documented thrombolysis in 9 of the 10 animals with intracranial emboli and only 1 of the 6 with cervical emboli. Thrombolysis occurred in 4 of the 5 rabbits with cervical emboli treated with intracarotid rTPA. Intravenous rTPA therapy produced a significantly (P less than 0.01) higher rate of thrombolysis in intracranial as compared to cervical thrombus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To assess the value of brain biopsies in tuberculomas, the records of 15 patients aged 6 to 80 years were reviewed. Histological confirmation was obtained in 15 patients, and acid-fast bacilli were cultured from 12 patients. Intracranial hypertension was the principal sign in 11 patients; other neurological signs were related to the location of the tuberculoma. One patient had evidence of extracranial tuberculosis. Biopsy-related complications consisted of an epidural hematoma in 1 patient and hydrocephalus in another; both required additional surgery. One case of tuberculous meningitis was probably related to surgery and poor drug compliance. There was no postoperative mortality. Thirteen patients (2 were lost to follow-up) were cured after an average of 16 months of antituberculous therapy. It was concluded that the brain biopsy is useful in diagnosing tuberculoma but that there is some associated risk.\r"

Immunologic studies showed decrease of all COX subunits studied, without a specific defect of any one of them. Southern blot analysis excluded large deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) but revealed a generalized increase in mtDNA quantity. Although Northern blot analysis showed no alteration in the 12 COX subunit mRNAs studied, two of three patients showed a decreased steady state rate of COX transcription in brain. COX deficiency in LS thus appears to be related to a decreased amount of otherwise normal COX holoenzyme.\r"

Urine from MS patients showed statistically significant increases in free L chains compared with the other groups, although there was overlap between MS patients and OND patients. The ratio of kappa/creatinine was significantly greater in the relapsing-remitting MS group than in patients with clinically stable MS, OND, and normal controls. Elevated free L chains were usually independent of urinary albumin and beta 2-microglobulin levels. Serial studies showed that urinary free kappa/creatinine ratios were elevated during periods of clinical worsening in seven of eight MS patients and subsequently decreased during clinical recovery. The measurement of free L chains in urine obtained at intervals from MS patients may be useful as a marker to monitor disease activity.\r"

We report here that transposase represses transcription from the P-element promoter in vitro. This transcriptional repression is blocked by prior formation of an RNA polymerase II transcription complex on the template DNA. Binding of transposase on the P-element promoter is blocked by prior binding of either the Drosophila RNA polymerase II complex or the yeast transcription factor TFIID. These data suggest that transposase represses transcription by preventing assembly of an RNA polymerase II complex at the P-element promoter.\r"

We compare the effects of expressing CD4 and CD8 alpha either individually or together in a class II-restricted T-cell hybridoma. We also compare the effects of expressing truncated forms of CD4 or CD8 alpha that do not have a cytoplasmic tail and thus do not associate with the T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase p56lck, which has been implicated in T-cell activation. We demonstrate that, although CD4 and CD8 alpha can specifically enhance interleukin 2 secretion, maximal potentiation occurs with expression of CD4, which, unlike CD8, can bind to the same major histocompatibility complex protein as the T-cell receptor. Our data further indicate that the cytoplasmic tail and/or the associated p56lck are primarily significant for interleukin 2 secretion by the hybridomas we have examined when CD4 or CD8 can bind to the same major histocompatibility complex ligand as the T-cell receptor.\r"

  ".W": "A neuron-specific Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, CaM kinase Gr, phosphorylates selectively a Ras-related GTP-binding protein (Rap-1b) that is enriched in brain tissue. The phosphorylation reaction achieves a stoichiometry of about 1 and involves a serine residue near the carboxyl terminus of the substrate. Both CaM kinase Gr and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but not CaM kinase II, phosphorylate identical or contiguous serine residues in Rap-1b. The rate of phosphorylation of Rap-1b by CaM kinase Gr is enhanced following autophosphorylation of the protein kinase. Other low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins belonging to the Ras superfamily, including Rab-3A, Rap-2b, and c-Ha-ras p21, are not phosphorylated by CaM kinase Gr. The phosphorylation of Rap-1b itself can be reversed by an endogenous brain phosphoprotein phosphatase. These observations provide a potential connection between a neuronal Ca2(+)-signaling pathway and a specific low molecular weight GTP-binding protein that may regulate neuronal transmembrane signaling, vesicle transport, or neurotransmitter release.\r"

IL-1ra is a pure antagonist and has no agonist activity in in vitro or in vivo systems. By site-specific mutagenesis, an analog of IL-1ra was created that contained a substitution of a single amino acid, Lys-145----Asp. This analog, IL-1ra K145D, exhibited partial agonist activity in the D10.G4.1 cell proliferation assay. The newly acquired agonist activity could not be neutralized by antisera to IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta, but it could be blocked by a monoclonal antibody to the T-cell IL-1 receptor. The analog also showed agonist activity as assayed by increased prostaglandin E2 synthesis from CHO cells expressing recombinant mouse IL-1 receptor. These results with IL-1ra K145D demonstrate the importance of the region surrounding the corresponding Asp-145 residue in IL-1 beta for triggering the biological response to IL-1.\r"

Previous evidence implicated the SNF5 protein in transcriptional activation, and a DNA-bound LexA-SNF5 fusion protein was shown to activate expression of a nearby promoter. Here, we examine the functional relationship of the SNF2, SNF5, and SNF6 proteins. Activation by DNA-bound LexA-SNF5 fusion protein was greatly reduced in snf2 and snf6 mutants, indicating that activation by LexA-SNF5 requires SNF2 and SNF6 function. An spt6 mutation, which suppresses transcriptional defects caused by snf2, restored activation by LexA-SNF5 in a snf2 mutant. The SNF2 gene was sequenced and encodes a 194-kDa protein that is targeted to the nucleus. DNA-bound LexA-SNF2 fusion protein also activated transcription, dependent on SNF5 and SNF6. These findings suggest that SNF2, SNF5, and SNF6 function interdependently in transcriptional activation, possibly forming a heteromeric complex.\r"

Analysis of the protein sequence showed that it shared 59% amino acid identity with sheep prostaglandin G/H synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting steps in the production of prostaglandins. Significant differences, at both the protein and mRNA levels, existed between the src oncogene product-inducible prostaglandin synthase and the protein isolated and cloned from sheep seminal vesicle, suggesting that the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase may be a new form of the enzyme. A distinguishing feature of src-inducible prostaglandin synthase mRNA is its low abundance in nonproliferating chicken embryo fibroblasts and its relatively high abundance in src-transformed cells. Additionally, the majority of the src-inducible prostaglandin synthase RNA present in nonproliferating cells was found to be nonfunctional because of the presence of an unspliced intron that separated the signal peptide from the remainder of the protein. Upon mitogenic stimulation, this intron was removed, resulting in the induction of fully-spliced CEF-147 mRNA.\r"

We used an antibody to CA IV, the membrane-anchored isozyme from human lung, to study CA IV in eye tissues and to compare its distribution with that of CA II. We found intense immunostaining for CA IV associated with endothelial cells of one specific uveal capillary bed, the choriocapillaris. CA IV was not detected in endothelial cells of the contiguous capillaries of the iris or in endothelial cells of other vessels. Immunoreactivity for CA IV was also intense in epithelial and fiber cells of the lens but was not detectable in the neuroretina, the ciliary process (except for capillaries), and the cornea, all sites where immunostaining with anti-CA II antibody was intense. These studies indicate that the membrane-associated CA in human eye, which was suspected from histochemical studies, is CA IV. Defining the physiological role of this ocular isozyme remains a challenge.\r"

All three responses are accompanied by similar levels of cell proliferation. However, although interferon gamma gene expression is strongly induced during both physiological recognition of the OVA peptide and allogeneic major histocompatibility complex recognition, expression of this gene was not detected during the Mls response. These studies indicate that Mls recognition is functionally distinct from T-cell recognition of peptides and alloantigens and leads to an alternative pattern of cytokine gene expression. They also suggest the possibility that encounter with these two classes of T-cell antigen in vivo may generate subsets of T helper cells that display different patterns of cytokine gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "91187871\r", 
  ".W": "Interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), a powerful endogenous pyrogen released from monocytes and macrophages by bacterial endotoxin, stimulates corticotropin, prolactin, and somatotropin release and inhibits thyrotropin release by hypothalamic action. We injected recombinant human IL-1 alpha into the third cerebral ventricle, to study its effect on the pulsatile release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) in conscious, freely moving, ovariectomized rats. Intraventricular injection of 0.25 pmol of IL-1 alpha caused an almost immediate reduction of plasma LH concentration; this decrease was statistically significant 20 min after injection and occurred through a highly significant reduction in the number of LH pulses, with no effect on pulse amplitude. In contrast, there was no change in pulse frequency but a small significant elevation in amplitude of FSH pulses. Intraventricular injection of the diluent had no effect on gonadotropin release. The results provide further evidence for separate hypothalamic control mechanisms for FSH and LH release. To determine the mechanism of the suppression of LH release, mediobasal hypothalamic fragments were incubated in vitro with IL-1 alpha (10 pM) and the release of LH-releasing hormone (LHRH) and prostaglandin E2 into the medium was measured by RIA in the presence or absence of norepinephrine (50 microM). IL-1 alpha reduced basal LHRH release and blocked LHRH release induced by norepinephrine. It had no effect on the basal release of prostaglandin E2; however, it completely inhibited the release of PGE2 evoked by norepinephrine. To evaluate the possibility that IL-1 alpha might also interfere with the epoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids were also measured. IL-1 alpha had no effect on the content of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the hypothalamic fragments as measured by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. In conclusion, IL-1 alpha suppresses LH but not FSH release by an almost complete cessation of pulsatile release of LH in the castrated rat. The mechanism of this effect appears to be by inhibition of prostaglandin E2-mediated release of LHRH.\r"

To understand the physiological significance of the interactions of proteins with GAGs, it is critical that relationships between GAG structure and binding be analyzed. It is particularly important that interactions depending on common structural features of GAGs (e.g., size, charge density, and disaccharide repeat unit) be distinguished from those mediated by specific sequences of carbohydrate modification. Gathering the information needed to make such distinctions has so far been difficult, however, partly because structurally homogeneous samples of GAGs are lacking but also because of technical difficulties associated with performing and interpreting assays of protein-GAG binding. We describe an electrophoretic method useful for both measuring affinity and evaluating structural selectivity in protein-GAG binding. Data are presented on the binding of the GAG heparin to the protease inhibitor antithrombin III, the acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors, and the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin. Results obtained with fibronectin are consistent with a model in which high-affinity binding (Kd approximately 34 nM) is mediated through the recognition of specific carbohydrate sequences.\r"

Southern blot hybridization showed no gross abnormality to be present in the patient's apoA-I gene and homozygosity for a haplotype of restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the apoA-I gene region.

The data from dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes indicated that she was homozygous for the apoA-I gene with regard to the two mutations. The codon 37 missense mutation was also detected in the apoA-I gene of 6 out of 60 controls, who all had normal levels of apoA-I and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, suggesting that the missense mutation is polymorphic and not associated with apoA-I deficiency.

Using probes selective for each alternatively spliced variant of D2 receptor mRNA, we determined that both variants were widely distributed in rat brain and pituitary but that the ratio of the forms varied among regions. mRNA for the 444-amino acid-long variant, D2(444), was the most abundant form in pituitary and neostriatum. Intermediate levels of both D2(444) mRNA and the short form, D2(415), were detected in midbrain, and low levels of D2(444) and D2(415) mRNAs were detected in all other regions examined, including hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex. The D2(444)/D2(415) ratio was generally lower in the regions of low expression than in pituitary and neostriatum. Dopamine-depleting lesions increased the density of D2 receptors in the denervated neostriatum by 29% without altering the affinity of the receptors for [3H]spiperone. The proliferation of receptors appeared to be due to a lesion-induced increase of up to 120% in the abundance of both variants of mRNA in the neostriatum.\r"

Stable expression of the polymerase was achieved in the cell line 2fTGH, which carries an IFN-inducible marker gene, by growth under conditions that select for inhibition of the response to IFN-alpha, but the clones grew poorly. When expressed alone, the terminal protein domain of the polymerase gene inhibited the response to IFN-alpha and the reverse transcriptase plus RNase H domains appeared to be toxic. Clones of cells expressing terminal protein alone, selected for the loss of response to IFN-alpha, grew normally and had no detectable response to IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, or double-stranded RNA. Binding of IFN-alpha to these cells was not impaired but did not lead to activation of the E alpha subunit of the IFN-induced transcription factor E.

  ".W": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains expressing the activated RAS2Val19 gene or lacking both cAMP phosphodiesterase genes, PDE1 and PDE2, have impaired growth control and display an acute sensitivity to heat shock. We have isolated two classes of mammalian cDNAs from yeast expression libraries that suppress the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of RAS2Val19 strain. Members of the first class of cDNAs also suppress the heat shock-sensitive phenotype of pde1- pde2- strains and encode cAMP phosphodiesterases. Members of the second class fail to suppress the phenotype of pde1- pde2- strains and therefore are candidate cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with RAS proteins. We report the nucleotide sequence of three members of this class. Two of these cDNAs share considerable sequence similarity, but none are clearly similar to previously isolated genes.\r"

  ".U": "91187910\r", 
  ".W": "Expansion of the blood volume causes a release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) that is believed to be important in induction of the subsequent natriuresis and diuresis which, in turn, acts to reduce the increase in blood volume. Since stimulation of the anteroventral portion of the third cerebral ventricle (AV3V) induced a rapid elevation of plasma ANP, whereas lesions of the AV3V were followed by a marked decline in plasma concentration of the peptide, we hypothesized that release of ANP from the brain ANP neuronal system might be important to the control of plasma ANP. The perikarya of the ANP-containing neurons are densely distributed in the AV3V and their axons project to the median eminence and neural lobe. To test the hypothesis that these neurons are involved in volume-expansion-induced ANP release, by using electrolysis we destroyed the AV3V, the site of the perikarya, in male rats. Other lesions were made in the median eminence and posterior pituitary, sites of termination of the axons of these neurons, and also hypophysectomy was performed in other animals. In conscious freely moving animals, volume expansion and stimulation of postulated sodium receptors in the hypothalamus were induced by injection of hypertonic NaCl solution [0.5 or 0.3 M NaCl; 2 ml/100 g (body weight)]. Volume expansion alone was induced with the same volume of an isotonic solution (NaCl or glucose). In the sham-operated rats, volume expansion with hypertonic or isotonic solutions caused equivalent rapid increases in plasma ANP that peaked at 5 min and returned nearly to control values by 15 min. Lesions caused a decrease in the initial levels of plasma ANP on comparison with values from the sham-operated rats, and each type of lesion induced a highly significant suppression of the response to volume expansion on testing 1-5 days after lesions were made. Because a common denominator of the lesions was elimination of the brain ANP neuronal system, these results suggest that the brain ANP plays an important role in the mediation of the release of ANP that occurs after volume expansion. Since the content of ANP in this system is much less than that in the atria, there must be a remarkable increase in synthesis and release of brain ANP associated with this stimulus. It is also possible that blockade of volume-expansion-induced release of other neurohypophyseal hormones, such as endothelin, may block release of ANP from atrial myocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Several monokines, proteins secreted by monocytes and macrophages, alter release of hormones from the anterior pituitary. We report here the ability of femtomolar concentrations of interleukin 2 (IL-2), a lymphokine released from T lymphocytes, to alter directly pituitary hormone release. The effects of concentrations of IL-2 ranging from 10(-17) to 10(-9) M on anterior pituitary hormone release were evaluated in vitro. Hemipituitaries were preincubated in 1 ml of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (KRB) followed by incubation for 1 or 2 hr with KRB or KRB containing different concentrations of IL-2. This was followed by incubation for 30 min in 56 mM potassium medium to study the effect of pretreatment with IL-2 on subsequent depolarization-induced hormone release. Prolactin (PRL), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), corticotropin (ACTH), growth hormone (GH), and thyrotropic hormone (TSH) released into the incubation medium were measured by radioimmunoassay. IL-2 stimulated the basal release of PRL at 1 or 2 hr but suppressed the subsequent depolarization-induced PRL release, perhaps because the readily releasable pool of PRL was exhausted. The minimal effective dose (MED) was 10(-15) M. Conversely, IL-2 significantly suppressed the basal release of LH and FSH at 1 or 2 hr, with a MED of 10(-16) M, thus demonstrating a reciprocal action of the cytokine on lactotrophs and gonadotrophs. The subsequent depolarization-induced release of LH and FSH was suppressed, indicative of a persistent inhibitory action of IL-2. IL-2 stimulated ACTH and TSH release at 1 hr and the MEDs were 10(-12) and 10(-15) M, respectively. Conversely, IL-2 significantly lowered the basal release of GH at 1 hr, with a MED of 10(-15) M. The release of GH was not altered at 2 hr. The high potassium-induced release of ACTH, TSH, and GH was not affected. The results demonstrate that IL-2 at picomolar concentrations affects the release of anterior pituitary hormones. This cytokine may serve as an important messenger from lymphocytes exerting a direct paracrine action on the pituitary by its release from lymphocytes in the gland or concentrations in the blood that reach the gland may be sufficient to activate it.\r"

The isolation of such a gene was achieved by randomly inactivating genes by an anti-sense complementary DNA expression library followed by direct selection for growth in the presence of an inhibitory polypeptide. Thus, a gene whose inactivation conveyed growth resistance to interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was isolated. Sequence analysis showed complete identity with human thioredoxin, a dithiol reducing agent, implicated here in the IFN-gamma-mediated growth arrest of HeLa cells.\r"

  ".W": "The natriuretic peptides are hormones that can stimulate natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant activity in vivo, presumably through the activation of two known cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclases (ANPR-A and ANPR-B). Although atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and, to a lesser extent, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are efficient activators of the ANPR-A guanylyl cyclase, neither hormone can significantly stimulate ANPR-B. A member of this hormone family, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), potently and selectively activated the human ANPR-B guanylyl cyclase. CNP does not increase guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in cells expressing human ANPR-A. The affinity of CNP for ANPR-B is 50- or 500-fold higher than ANP or BNP, respectively. This ligand-receptor pair may be involved in the regulation of fluid homeostasis by the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The crystal structure of the ribonuclease (RNase) H domain of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) has been determined at a resolution of 2.4 A and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.20. The protein folds into a five-stranded mixed beta sheet flanked by an asymmetric distribution of four alpha helices. Two divalent metal cations bind in the active site surrounded by a cluster of four conserved acidic amino acid residues. The overall structure is similar in most respects to the RNase H from Escherichia coli. Structural features characteristic of the retroviral protein suggest how it may interface with the DNA polymerase domain of p66 in the mature RT heterodimer. These features also offer insights into why the isolated RNase H domain is catalytically inactive but when combined in vitro with the isolated p51 domain of RT RNase H activity can be reconstituted. Surprisingly, the peptide bond cleaved by HIV-1 protease near the polymerase-RNase H junction of p66 is completely inaccessible to solvent in the structure reported here. This suggests that the homodimeric p66-p66 precursor of mature RT is asymmetric with one of the two RNase H domains at least partially unfolded.\r"
