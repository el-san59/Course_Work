  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To see whether small daily doses of prednisolone have any adverse effect on short term linear growth in children with mild asthma. DESIGN--Double blind, random order crossover trial of two dosages of prednisolone. During run in and washout periods patients were given placebo. All treatment periods were of two weeks' duration. SETTING--Outpatient clinic referrals in a secondary referral centre. PATIENTS--14 Children (10 boys) aged 7-11 years with normal growth velocity during the previous year, no signs of puberty, and no history of receiving systemic or topical steroids during the two months before the study. One child was excluded because his pulmonary function deteriorated and another was withdrawn because of varicella. INTERVENTIONS--2.5 and 5.0 mg prednisolone daily given in divided dosage in the morning and evening. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Growth of the lower leg as measured twice a week by knemometry. RESULTS--A significant reduction in mean growth velocity of the lower leg occurred in both prednisolone treatment periods. The mean difference between the run in period and the treatment period with 2.5 mg prednisolone daily was 0.63 mm/week (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.80 mm/week) and between the run in period and the treatment period with 5.0 mg prednisolone daily 0.57 mm/week (0.38 to 0.77 mm/week). CONCLUSION--Small daily doses of prednisolone suppress short term linear growth in children with mild asthma. The clinical relevance of this finding needs further study.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To assess whether monthly treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone enhances or accelerates the effect of disease modifying drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. DESIGN--A 12 month double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial in which patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were randomly allocated to receive pulses of either methylprednisolone or saline every four weeks for six months. At the start of the pulse treatment all patients were started on penicillamine or azathioprine. SETTING--Four rheumatology departments in Denmark. PATIENTS--97 Patients (71 women, 26 men) aged 23-84 (mean 60) who had active rheumatoid arthritis of at least four weeks' duration despite treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Monthly clinical recording of morning stiffness, number of tender and swollen joints, blinded observers' evaluation of therapeutic effect, and patients' self assessed condition. Concomitant laboratory measurements of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and concentrations of C reactive protein and haemoglobin. Radiography to determine the number of erosions at the start of treatment and after 12 months. RESULTS--57 Patients completed the trial, taking the same disease modifying drug throughout. Evaluation four weeks after each pulse treatment and at 12 month follow up showed no significant differences between the methylprednisolone and placebo groups in any of the clinical or laboratory variables. Radiography showed the same degree of progression of erosions in both groups. Evaluation of the total data on 97 patients and on the 57 who completed the trial showed the same lack of significance between the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS--Intravenous pulse treatment with steroids can be recommended only for rapid temporary relief of flares of disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The response is short lived. Repeated pulses of methylprednisolone at four week intervals do not improve the results of treatment with drugs that induce remission such as penicillamine and azathioprine.\r"

Persistence of cysts without any change in the morphology and cyst enlargement were taken as criteria for unsuccessful treatment. Development of echogenic foci and increase in density of cyst fluid were considered as a therapeutic effect. Changes in cyst wall such as thickening and deposition of calcium and detachment of the cyst membrane may also indicate response. An essential criterion, for a positive drug effect, was cyst size reduction as well as shape deformation. However, the most convincing and reliable criterion was the complete disappearance of hydatid cysts. Comparative assessment of the therapeutic effect of the two drugs favoured albendazole.\r"

The recent interest in continent diversions was primarily an attempt to improve the quality of life rather than improve survival or reduce renal and metabolic complications. Although continent stomas can be achieved with low pressure reservoirs fashioned from detubularised or augmented bowel, many operations may be required to perfect the continent stoma. Long-term results using continent reservoirs are awaited. It seems that a bladder substitute using reconfigurated bowel is preferable to a continent reservoir but continence remains a problem and all of the techniques lack long-term follow-up. The use of bladder substitutes in females is limited by the need to use a prosthetic sphincter to achieve continence.\r"

The ability of these clinicians to assess when stone disintegration has been achieved also needs to be confirmed. A wide range of data was recorded from each of 2688 lithotripsy treatments performed over a 2-year period using the EDAP LT.01 ultrasound-imaged piezoelectric lithotriptor. An analysis of these data was performed using a comprehensive microcomputer-based statistics package. The mean time taken for stone imaging and positioning was reduced from 11.2 to 7.5 min over the 2-year period. Obese patients and those with renal pelvic stones were best imaged in a lateral position. Overall there was no difference in percentage stone disintegration or clearance between treatments in the supine or lateral positions, but a significant reduction in the clearance of small caliceal stones resulted when the lateral position was used. Factors associated with a significantly greater percentage of stone disintegration and clearance included pain experienced by the patient during fine adjustment of the processing head during treatment, acoustic focus attenuation and widening and acoustic shadow widening as detected by the urologist at the end of treatment. Among the factors not associated with significant alterations in the percentage of stone disintegration or clearance were the lithotriptor operator, the side or site of the calculus, obesity and shockwave frequency or power. This study confirmed the ability of urologists to develop expertise in ultrasonography for renal stone imaging and to interpret successfully the subtle signs of stone disintegration.\r"

In normal human bladder tissue the non-specific protease activity was approximately 2-fold higher than in tissue samples obtained from transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCC). In contrast, PA activity was almost 4-fold higher in TCC than in normal transition cell epithelium. Acid-treated urine from 19 patients with TCC of the bladder exhibited significantly higher levels of plasminogen activator activity than similarly treated urine from controls. These results indicate that malignant transformation of the bladder epithelial tissue results in elevated levels of PA in the tissue and in urine. Further studies are needed to assess the potential of PA determination in the management of bladder cancer patients.\r"

A significantly higher objective response rate and better symptomatic control was noted in patients treated with AG + HC (31%) compared with those treated with MPA + HC (3%). The median time to treatment failure was also significantly longer for patients treated with AG + HC. These findings suggest a role for AG in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. While both second-line hormone treatment regimens resulted in significant suppression of adrenal androgen secretion, the differences in response rate could not be explained by alterations in peripheral blood hormone levels. AG in high doses may have cellular effects which require further study.\r"

  ".W": "1. To determine whether chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induces a decrease in proximal tubular angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, urine and blood samples were collected in conscious New Zealand rabbits before and after 16 days administration in drinking water of low doses of captopril (2.6 +/- 0.6 mg 24 h-1 kg-1), high doses of captopril (7.6 +/- 0.9 mg 24 h-1 kg-1) or no captopril (controls). The kidneys were then removed and angiotensin-converting enzyme activity was determined in isolated pars recta of microdissected nephrons as pmol of tritiated hippurylglycylglycine substrate hydrolysed min-1 of incubation and mm-1 of tubule. 2. Both low and high doses of captopril significantly decreased plasma angiotensin-converting enzyme activity and increased plasma renin activity, thus indicating an effective inhibition of circulating angiotensin-converting enzyme. Both low and high doses of captopril also significantly decreased mean arterial pressure and increased water intake and urine flow rate. Neither dose modified creatinine clearance and absolute and fractional sodium excretion. 3. None of the doses altered urinary kallikrein excretion. Urinary excretion of kinins was increased by 98.7% compared with control rabbits by the high dose of captopril (402 +/- 152 vs 251 +/- 104 ng/24 h, P less than 0.01) but was unchanged by the low dose of captopril. 4. Angiotensin-converting enzyme activity in the pars recta was lower in rabbits given the high dose of captopril than in control rabbits (17.6 +/- 7.2 vs 37.3 +/- 9.0 pmol min-1 mm-1, P less than 0.01) but was not decreased in rabbits given the low dose of captopril (40.4 +/- 5.0 pmol min-1 mm-1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In eight healthy volunteers we compared leg blood flow, as determined in a calf segment by strain-gauge plethysmography, with the flow measured by a constant-rate infusion of Indocyanine Green dye into the femoral artery. The representativeness of the calf segment was evaluated by complementary measurements with additional strain gauges attached around the proximal and distal crural and the distal thigh segments (n = 6). Furthermore, we investigated the influence of the catheterization procedure and a simulated vascular puncture, as well as repeated venous occlusions, on blood flow and on arterial and femoral venous substrate concentrations and blood gases (n = 8). 2. The leg blood flow measured by dye dilution was 0.31 +/- 0.03 litre/min (mean +/- SEM). The blood flow in the calf segments was 14.8 +/- 1.6 ml min-1 litre-1 and no difference between the legs was observed. Extended to the whole leg the plethysmographic blood flow was 0.17 +/- 0.01 litre/min and thus lower (43 +/- 7%, P less than 0.001) than the flow determined by the indicator-dilution method. Blood flow in the legs was not influenced by catheterization or sham punctures of the vessels or by repeated venous occlusions. 3. The concentrations of glucose, lactate and glycerol, as well as blood gas variables, in arterial and femoral venous blood did not change during the study or decreased so slightly (pH and lactate) that the arteriovenous difference was not influenced. 4. We conclude that the blood flow of the total leg cannot be satisfactorily estimated from strain-gauge plethysmography of a single calf segment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight nephrotic patients were studied in order to evaluate the effects of acute changes in renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate on renal solute and water handling, in the absence of plasma volume expansion. 2. The subjects were studied first after the administration of captopril, a manoeuvre that increased renal plasma flow without a significant change in glomerular filtration rate, and a second time after receiving combined therapy with captopril and ibuprofen, a manoeuvre that decreased glomerular filtration rate without a significant change in renal plasma flow. 3. After captopril therapy, despite the increase in renal plasma flow, there was no significant change in proximal sodium reabsorption (as estimated from fractional lithium reabsorption), urine volume or urine osmolality. 4. The decrease in glomerular filtration rate observed after the administration of captopril plus ibuprofen was associated with decreases in fractional excretion of sodium and urine volume, and an increase in urine osmolality. The changes in these parameters of tubular function were proportionate to the changes in glomerular filtration rate. Fractional proximal sodium reabsorption increased substantially. 5. These observations suggest that, in the absence of plasma volume expansion, an increase in renal plasma flow does not increase sodium or water excretion by the nephrotic kidney. Moreover, during acute decreases in glomerular filtration rate, glomerulotubular balance appears to be disrupted, resulting in disproportionately high rates of proximal tubule sodium reabsorption.\r"

  ".U": "90360643\r", 
  ".W": "We review recent studies on the central neural control of esophageal motility, emphasizing the anatomy and chemical coding of esophageal pathways in the spinal cord and medulla. Sympathetic innervation of the proximal esophagus is derived primarily from cervical and upper thoracic paravertebral ganglia, whereas that of the lower esophageal sphincter and proximal stomach is derived from the celiac ganglion. In addition to noradrenaline, many sympathetic fibers in the esophagus contain neuropeptide Y (NPY), and both noradrenaline and NPY appear to decrease blood flow and motility. Preganglionic neurons innervating the cervical and upper thoracic ganglia are located at lower cervical and upper thoracic spinal levels. The preganglionic innervation of the celiac ganglion arises from lower thoracic spinal levels. Both acetylcholine (ACh) and enkephalin (ENK) have been localized in sympathetic preganglionic neurons, and it has been suggested that ENK acts to pre-synaptically inhibit ganglionic transmission. Spinal afferents from the esophagus are few, but have been described in lower cervical and thoracic dorsal root ganglia. A significant percentage contain calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP). The central distribution of spinal afferents, as well as their subsequent processing within the spinal cord, have not been addressed. Medullary afferents arise from the nodose ganglion and terminate peripherally both in myenteric ganglia, where they have been postulated to act as tension receptors, and, to a lesser extent, in more superficial layers. Centrally, these afferents appear to end in a discrete part of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) termed the central subnucleus. The transmitter specificity of the majority of these afferents remains unknown. The central subnucleus, in turn, sends a dense and topographically discrete projection to esophageal motor neurons in the rostral portion of the nucleus ambiguous (NA). Both somatostatin-(SS) and ENK-related peptides have been localized in this pathway. Finally, motor neurons from the rostral NA innervate striated portions of the esophagus. In addition to ACh, these esophageal motor neurons contain CGRP, galanin (GAL), N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The physiological effect of these peptides on esophageal motility remains unclear. Medullary control of smooth muscle portions of the esophagus have not been thoroughly investigated.\r"

The age and sex distribution of these patients have changed over the years and shifted toward older patients (mean, 53 years) and female predominance (female:male ratio, 1.4:1). The clinical presentation was usually of distal closed-loop small bowel obstruction. Forty-six percent of the plain abdominal radiographs were suspected for cecal volvulus, but only 17 percent were diagnostic. Barium enema had a high rate of accuracy (88 percent) and was associated with minimal complications. True volvulus was 6 times more common than bascule, and gangrenous cecum was found in 20 percent of cases. Detorsion alone and cecopexy had almost similar complications, mortality, and recurrence rates (15, 10, and 13 percent, respectively), whereas, resection, which was performed primarily for gangrenous cecum, had higher rates. However, the highest rates of complications (52 percent), mortality (22 percent), and recurrence (14 percent) were noticed after cecostomy. These data suggest that resection should be reserved for patients with necrotic cecum and that detorsion is sufficient for patients with viable cecum. Cecostomy should be abandoned.\r"

  ".W": "Cholelithiasis is considered an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's ileitis but has not been associated with ulcerative colitis. To evaluate if an increased risk of cholelithiasis exists in patients with ulcerative colitis, biliary ultrasonography was performed on 159 patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 114 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 45 patients with Crohn's disease. A control population of 2453 residents of the town near the authors' institute was also studied. An echographic survey of gallstones was performed on the control subjects, who participated in the Multicentrica Italiana Colelitiasi (MICOL). Seventeen patients with inflammatory bowel disease had gallstones (10.7 percent), 11 patients with ulcerative colitis had gallstones (9.6 percent), and 6 patients with Crohn's disease had gallstones (13.3 percent). In the control population, diagnosis of cholelithiasis was made in 239 subjects (9.7 percent). An estimate of the relative risk (odds ratio) of gallstones in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and also in 4 subgroups formed on the basis of the extent of disease (total ulcerative colitis, partial ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease with ileitis, Crohn's disease without ileitis) with respect to the general population was calculated using logistic regression with gallstones, sex, age, and body mass index as independent variables and inflammatory bowel disease as a dependent variable. The author's findings show an increased risk of gallstones in both patients with Crohn's disease (odds ratio = 3.6; 95 percent confidence limits = 1.2 - 10.4; P = 0.02) and patients with ulcerative colitis (odds ratio = 2.5; 95 percent confidence limits = 1.2 - 5.2; P = 0.01). The risk was highest in patients with Crohn's disease involving the distal ileum (odds ratio = 4.5; 95 percent confidence limits = 1.5 - 14.1; P = 0.009) and in patients with total ulcerative colitis extending to the cecum (odds ratio = 3.3; 95 percent confidence limits = 1.3 - 8.6; P = 0.01). These results confirm that there is an increased risk of gallstones in Crohn's ileitis but they show that there also exists an increased risk in patients with total ulcerative colitis.\r"

In the present study ultrasonography was used to determine gallbladder emptying in response to a meal or separate cephalic or hormonal stimulation in 21 diabetic patients and 10 healthy subjects. Gallbladder emptying and refilling after a meal were similar in diabetic patients and healthy subjects. When diabetics were divided according to the presence or absence of cardiac autonomic neuropathy (AN), a significant reduction of gallbladder emptying in response to cephalic stimulation was found in diabetics with AN (P less than 0.01 in comparison with diabetics without AN or healthy subjects). A dose-response curve of gallbladder emptying in response cerulein, a cholecystokinin analog, at concentrations of 0.25, 1, and 4 micrograms/kg/min was evaluated. No differences of gallbladder emptying were found in the three groups of subjects, indicating that gallbladder sensitivity to hormonal stimulation is not changed in diabetic patients with or without AN. Diabetic patients with AN have a significant reduction of gastric acid output and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) secretion in response to cephalic stimulation (P less than 0.05 in comparison with diabetic patients without AN or healthy subjects). Cerulein-induced PP secretion was similar in all three groups of subjects (P greater than 0.05). This study indicates that in diabetic patients with AN, gallbladder emptying as well as gastric acid and PP secretions induced by neural stimulation are markedly reduced in comparison to diabetics without AN.\r"

There also is support for a role for dopamine and dopamimetic agents in the treatment of certain experimental gastrointestinal diseases because some highly selective dopamine agonists are gastroprotective when given either parenterally or centrally. Based upon these observations, we suggest that dopamine is a key element of the \"brain-gut axis\" and represents a potentially important target for pharmacotherapeutic exploitation.\r"

Type III and type V collagen were more strongly stained in the periphery of focal necrosis. Type IV collagen was seen around the vessels and hepatocytes near the focal necrosis. Electron microscopy showed many transitional Ito cells in the area of focal necrosis and fibroblasts were observed in the portal tracts, showing collagen fiber deposition. Numerous collagen fibrils were observed around fibroblasts, Ito cells and hepatocytes. Using immunoelectron microscopy, type III and type IV collagen and fibronectin were observed in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of Ito cells and hepatocytes localized near the area of focal necrosis or fiber deposition. In addition, type IV collagen was seen in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of endothelial cells forming capillary vessels. These results suggest that several extracellular matrix components such as types III, IV and V collagen and fibronectin, produced by Ito cells, hepatocytes or endothelial cells, play important roles in the healing of liver damage in acute viral hepatitis.\r"

Using the multiple-indicator dilution-curve method, shunts greater than 15 microns in diameter were demonstrated between the portal and hepatic veins in six of eight cases, whereas shunts from the hepatic artery to the hepatic veins were absent. Perfusion of human livers obtained during hepatic transplantation is a fairly simple procedure that will allow researchers to gain new insights into cirrhosis in humans.\r"

The reticulin framework of the focus was relatively sparse compared with the surrounding noncancerous area. The focus had developed in a regenerative nodule apparently no different from other regenerative nodules of the cirrhosis and showed no accompanying preneoplastic lesion such as adenomatous hyperplasia. A thorough search for the primary lesion, including ultrasonographic imaging and superselective hepatic arteriography, demonstrated no mass lesion in the liver. Therefore, the lesion may have been an incipient de novo hepatocellular carcinoma, and this may be the first report of such a lesion discovered in a biopsy sample.\r"

However, it has only been with the development of reagents that phenotypically characterize the lymphoid infiltrate that attempts have been made to correlate pathophysiology with immune effector populations. Indeed, the inflammatory hepatic lesions in primary biliary cirrhosis have been described as containing CD4-positive and CD8-positive T cells. Less clear, however, have been the T cell receptors in these lesions. Further, the data on immunoglobulin deposits in hepatic lesions have been less well-defined; this deficit may be a result of the quality of polyspecific sera and difficulties in background. To address these issues, we have used a battery of well-defined monospecific and polyspecific reagents to phenotypically define the occurrence of lymphoid cells in the livers of patients undergoing transplantation. Furthermore, we have defined these same markers on T cell lines derived from liver, regional lymph node and peripheral blood. The predominant cell type in the mononuclear infiltrate is the CD3+, CD4+ T lymphocyte bearing the T cell receptor alpha beta. T cell lines from the same patients demonstrate similar findings. Of special importance, however, was the detection of CD20+ B cells and Ig+ cells in the lymphoid infiltrate. Indeed, we also readily demonstrated the presence of immunoglobulin on the surface of biliary epithelium. These data suggest that mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of primary biliary cirrhosis may include both T cell and antibody mechanisms. The results also underscore the need to develop a functional, and not just a phenotypical, assay of the inflammatory infiltrate.\r"

In some reports, variation in IR binding is attributed to the class I phenotype. To extend these observations, we have examined whether MHC class I products influence IR function, in particular, high affinity ligand-specific binding. Using two independent methods, we have compared IR affinity and density on a human B-lymphoblastoid cell line expressing HLA-A, -B products vs a null mutant and a set of transfectants where HLA-A3, -B7, or -Bw58 expression has been restored through gene transfer. The results from radioreceptor assay and RIA measuring IR binding and expression indicate that although there is a decrease in high affinity insulin binding sites in the HLA-A, -B null mutant, ligand binding cannot be restored in the transfectants expressing HLA-A or -B alleles. We conclude that the MHC class I products do not determine the insulin-binding phenotype of the cells examined in this study. Alternatively, we propose that insulin receptor heterogeneity in affinity and density may be influenced by other undetermined factors inherent to clonally expanded cells, thereby complicating dissection of IR/MHC interactions.\r"

For each of the DR specificities and peptides studied, a unique pattern of interaction was observed. Excellent correlation was detected between the DR1-, 2-, 5-, and 52a-binding capacities and the known DR restrictions of a panel of synthetic peptides. This supports the immunologic relevance of the binding assay, and emphasizes the importance of determinant selection in defining the immune response of individuals. We have also examined the capacity of a panel of DR-restricted peptides to compete with one another for binding to DR1. The results obtained are compatible with a single peptide-binding site on DR molecules. The peptide-binding capacity of the four different DR types (DR1, DR2, DR5, and DR52a) has been further examined by testing a collection of 133 different peptides. This collection is unbiased with respect to previously known DR binding and restrictions, and includes peptides of eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral origins. It was found that: 1) approximately 15 to 35% of the peptides tested bound any given DR type; 2) DR-binding capacities appeared to correlate with each other, suggesting that different alleles of the DR isotype may recognize related structures on an Ag molecule; and 3) despite the statistical correlation between binding capacity of different DR types, approximately 50% of the peptides that were positive binders still were specific in that they could bind only one of the four DR molecules tested. Degenerate binding (i.e., binding to most or all the DR molecules tested) was detected in only a minority of the cases analyzed (approximately 25%).\r"

  ".W": "A number of natural and recombinant human cytokines have been tested for their ability to activate basophil and neutrophil adhesiveness for human umbilical vein endothelial cells in vitro. Coincubation of basophils and endothelial cell monolayers for 10 min with biologically relevant concentrations of rIL-1, natural IL-2, rIL-4, rIL-5, rIL-6, rIL-8, rGM-CSF, and rIFN-gamma had no effect on basophil adhesiveness. In contrast, rIL-3 induced basophil adhesiveness for endothelial cells (optimal at 1 ng/ml: 144 +/- 18% of control adherence (mean +/- SEM); control basophil binding, 13 +/- 3%, n = 9, p less than or equal to 0.05). This increase in adhesiveness was similar in magnitude to that induced by an optimal concentration of a known potent inducer of basophil adhesiveness (1 microM FMLP, 164 +/- 15% of control adherence, n = 9). Under these experimental conditions, the effects of rIL-3 occurred at concentrations of 0.1 to 30 ng/ml, were partially dependent on calcium, and were not accompanied by histamine release. Fixation experiments demonstrated that the effect of rIL-3 was directed against the basophil rather than the endothelial cell. Neither rIL-3 nor the other cytokines tested had any effect on the adherence of 51Cr-labeled neutrophils, even when tested simultaneously on cells from the same donors. Under experimental conditions that permitted histamine release, no correlation was seen between the ability of rIL-3 (0.3 to 300 ng/ml) to induce histamine release or enhance adhesiveness (n = 8). mAb blocking experiments demonstrated a role for both CD11 and CD18 adherence glycoproteins in basophil adherence induced by rIL-3, and indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis revealed that rIL-3 treatment led to rapid and sustained increases in cell surface expression of CD11b antigens on basophils but not neutrophils (e.g., after 10 min: 217 +/- 29 vs 91 +/- 11% of control mean fluorescence intensity, p less than 0.05). However, no correlation was seen between the magnitude of changes in CD11b expression and changes in adhesion when tested simultaneously. These results suggest that local production of IL-3 during allergic reactions in vivo may selectively promote basophil activation, adhesion to endothelium, and recruitment to extravascular sites of inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "As elevated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid histamine levels are noted in patients with pulmonary fibrosis (PF), we assayed BAL fluid from 16 patients with PF for the presence of a histamine releasing factor (HRF). HRF activity was assayed by measuring release of the preformed mast cell-derived mediators, histamine, or beta-hexosaminidase (beta-hex) from a purified population of IL-3 dependent mouse bone marrow derived mast cells (MBMMC) or human blood basophils. Mean BAL cell free histamine levels in the patients with PF was 1226 +/- 1349 pg/ml, whereas BAL histamine levels in a comparison group of six non-PF patients was 118 +/- 60 pg/ml. HRF was significantly elevated in BAL fluid of patients with PF (mean beta-hex release 24.5 +/- 12.9%; range 6.8 to 52.4%) compared to the non-PF group of patients (mean beta-hex release 7.9 +/- 7.7%; range 1.8 to 20.7%). The PF HRF not only degranulated MBMMC, but also induced the generation of the arachidonic acid metabolite leukotriene C4 from MBMMC (24.6 +/- 4.2 ng leukotriene C4/10(6) MBMMC). The PF HRF did not appear to be a cytokine previously identified in BAL fluid of patients with PF (i.e., platelet derived growth factor or insulin growth factor-1) or a human cytokine able to degranulate human basophils (i.e., IL-1, or granulocyte-macrophage-CSF) as these recombinant human cytokines did not induce MBMMC beta-hex release. Physicochemical characterization of the HRF revealed that it was relatively heat stable, pronase sensitive and on Sephadex G-75 and G-200 column chromatography had an apparent molecular mass of 30 to 50 kDa. The ability of PF BAL to induce beta-hex release from MBMMC was not dependent on IgE as unsensitized or lactic acid treated MBMMC release similar amounts of beta-hex compared to MBMMC sensitized with IgE. Thus, BAL fluid of patients with PF contains an HRF that induces beta-hex release from MBMMC via an IgE-independent mechanism. The presence of the HRF could explain elevated BAL histamine levels in patients with PF.\r"

  ".W": "Incubation of radiolabeled human C3a with rat peritoneal mast cells resulted in high levels of uptake and extensive degradation of the ligand. Both cell-bound and free radiolabeled human C3a underwent extensive degradation by rat mast cells even at 0 degrees C. We examined several protease inhibitors for their ability to prevent degradation of radiolabeled human C3a by the rat mast cells. The inhibitors PMSF, chymostatin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were most effective in preventing radiolabeled human C3a degradation. Degradation of the cell-bound ligand was totally inhibited only by PMSF. These compounds are effective inhibitors of a chymotrypsin-like enzyme (chymase) extracted from rat mast cells. Chemical cross-linking of radiolabeled human C3a to surface components on the rat mast cells, in the presence of PMSF, revealed one major and two minor bands. The mast cell component in both the major and minor bands proved to be chymase-associated based on a direct comparison with purified chymase isolated from rat mast cells. However, neither antichymase antibody nor chymase inhibitors influenced the degranulating activity of C3a on rat mast cells that occur independently of the C3a-chymase interactions. We conclude that there are neither specific C3a-binding sites on rat mast cells nor specific receptors whose occupancy leads to cellular activation. Although human C3ades Arg is inactive on guinea pig ileal and lung tissue, it binds to and induces degranulation of rat mast cells, as well as enhances vascular permeability in rat skin, at concentrations nearly identical to that of intact C3a. The fact that both C3a and C3ades Arg stimulated mast cell activation, at concentrations in excess of 10(-6) M, argues against specific binding sites for the anaphylatoxin on rat mast cells. It is proposed that the cationic C3a molecule activates rat mast cells in a secretory and nonlytic manner by a nonspecific mechanism similar to that of other polybasic compounds.\r"

  ".W": "Adenosine and adenosine receptor agonists have a variety of inhibitory effects on the generation of inflammatory mediators by neutrophils and other cell types. In human neutrophils stimulated with the chemotactic peptide FMLP, adenosine agonists inhibit O2- generation and degranulation. Because these findings suggest that the agonists may have potential as antiinflammatory agents, several compounds were evaluated for effects on the exudative and cellular phases of carrageenan-induced pleural inflammation in rats. All of the agonists tested inhibited both parameters of the inflammatory response. Inhibition appeared to correlate better with binding to the A1 than to the A2 receptor and was reversible by a known adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-phenyltheophylline. In mechanistic studies, R-N-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)adenosine, a standard A1 selective agonist, reversed the drop in circulating neutrophil count that occurs after injection of carrageenan. These results suggest that the agonists may prevent cell emigration by inhibiting adhesion to the endothelium or diapedesis. In addition (R)-N-(1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)adenosine had weak inhibitory effects on superoxide production by FMLP-stimulated rat neutrophils. Control studies showed that the effects of the agonists were not the result of agonist-induced hypotension nor corticosterone production by the adrenal glands. These findings indicate that adenosine receptor agonists are effective new pharmacologic tools for the study of inflammatory processes.\r"

In the present study, the influence of recombinant human (rh)IL-2, rhIL-3, and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage-CSF on basophilic differentiation of KU812-F cells was studied. Of all cytokines tested, rhIL-3 induced a significant increase in formation of metachromatically granulated cells (from 10% in control cultures up to 30% in cultures supplemented with 100 U/ml of rhIL-3) as well as dose-dependent (1.5- to 3 fold) increase in cellular histamine in KU812-F cell cultures. In addition, KU812-F cells exposed to rhIL-3 bound more IgE antibody than cells cultured in control medium with up to 3.3-fold increases in the mean fluorescence intensity on days 2 and/or 5 compared with control (p less than 0.001). RhIL-3 failed to induce significant changes in expression of the Tac-reactive subunit of the IL-2R (CD25), surface aminopeptidase N (CD13), ICAM-1 Ag (CD54), or CD40 Ag on KU812-F cells. To investigate the mechanism of IL-3 action on KU812-F cells, receptor analyses were performed by using 125I-radiolabeled rhIL-3. Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analyses revealed the presence of a single class of 1910 to 2460 high affinity IL-3-binding sites per KU812-F cell with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.22 to 2.35 x 10(-9) M. Together, these results show that rhIL-3 promotes basophilic differentiation of KU812-F cells through a specific receptor.\r"

Our recently established nude mouse model carrying an ascitic tumor of NALM-6 human pre-B leukemia cells was used as the tumor model. A marked difference was observed in the in vivo antitumor efficacy between SN5d-RA and SN5-RA; SN5d-RA was much more effective than SN5-RA. Several experiments were carried out to gain information concerning the mechanisms involved in the different antitumor efficacy of the two immunotoxins. Although naked (unconjugated) mAb SN5d was much less effective than SN5d-RA conjugates in the in vivo tumor suppression, mAb SN5d was more effective than mAb SN5 in the in vivo tumor suppression. Additionally, marked differences were found between SN5d and SN5 in the induction of antigenic modulation and in the regulation of Ag biosynthesis and expression. Binding of SN5 to NALM-6 leukemia cells caused strong antigenic modulation (down-regulation of Ag expression) and strongly down-regulated Ag biosynthesis and cell surface expression of new Ag. In contrast, binding of SN5d to NALM-6 leukemia cells caused little modulation of overall cell surface expression of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ag; the decrease of old Ag by endocytosis after binding to mAb SN5d was compensated by newly exocytosed cell-surface expressed Ag. The present results appear to reveal a novel mechanism which regulates cytotoxic activities of antibodies and immunoconjugates.\r"

We show that stress causes resistance to CTL and TNF in two cell lines. Induction of resistance is time dependent and reversible and not due to failure of killer cells to interact with stressed targets. It is shown that stress induces stress proteins concomitant with induction of resistance to killer cells and TNF. Moreover experiments are presented suggesting that resistance to either immune effector is due to independent mechanisms. The conclusion that stress can induce mechanisms in targets that interfere with the action of TNF as well as with target lysis following a lethal hit by CTL is discussed.\r"

Minimal differences were found when target symptoms were compared by preparation coating. In contrast, subjects receiving erythromycin at the 2-g/d dosage level reported higher incidence rates for each of the target symptoms, regardless of product coating, than did those patients treated at the 1-g/d dosage level. Enteric coating of erythromycin base offers little protection from the common dose-related gastrointestinal adverse effects of oral erythromycin.\r"

The EMIT dau antibody demonstrated high selectivity for benzoylecgonine. The precision was somewhat less than that reported earlier for other commercial cocaine metabolite immunoassays.

To facilitate identification of lymphatic and blood vessel invasion, the tumors were studied with an immunohistochemical technique using antibodies to endothelial markers. Peritumoral lymphatic and blood vessel invasion (PLBI) (encompassing both lymphatic and blood vessel invasion) was an adverse prognostic indicator independent of menopausal status, tumor size, and other histologic variables. Recurrence of disease and death resulting from carcinoma were significantly higher for patients with PLBI-present (+) tumors compared with patients with PLBI-absent (-) tumors (P less than .0001). The risk of recurrence for patients with PLBI+ tumors was 4.7 times that for their PLBI- counterparts. The presence of intratumoral lymphatic and blood vessel invasion (ILBI) is less important because few examples were found without concomitant PLBI. When PLBI was separated into lymphatic invasion and blood vessel invasion individually, the prognostic significance was retained in both groups. The immunohistochemical approach reduced both false-negative and false-positive observations and identified about 40% of PLBI that would have been missed by routine histologic examination alone. The presence of PLBI appears to be a potentially useful discriminant in predicting the outcome of patients with node-negative carcinoma of the breast.\r"

  ".U": "90362162\r", 
  ".W": "Between March 1984 and July 1988, 1,158 patients with Dukes' A, B, and C carcinoma of the colon were entered into National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) Protocol C-02. Patients were randomized to either no further treatment following curative resection or to postoperative fluorouracil (5-FU) and heparin administered via the portal vein. Therapy began on day of operation and consisted of constant infusion for 7 successive day. Average time on study was 41.8 months. A comparison between the two groups of patients indicated both an improvement in disease-free survival (74% v 64% at 4 years, overall P = .02) and a survival advantage (81% v 73% at 4 years, overall P = .07) in favor of the chemotherapy-treated group. When compared with the treated group, patients who received no further treatment had 1.26 times the risk of developing a treatment failure and 1.25 times the likelihood of dying after 4 years. Particularly significant was the failure to demonstrate an advantage from 5-FU in decreasing the incidence of hepatic metastases. The liver was the first site of treatment failure in 32.9% of 82 patients with documented recurrences in the control group and in 46.3% of 67 patients who received additional treatment. Therapy is administered via a regional route to affect the incidence of recurrence within the perfused anatomic boundary. Since, in this study, adjuvant portal-vein 5-FU infusion failed to reduce the incidence of hepatic metastases, it may be concluded that its use thus far is not justified. It may also be speculated that the disease-free survival and survival advantages (the latter of borderline significance) are a result of the systemic effects of 5-FU.\r"

To examine how the doctor's description and patient's expectations of the benefit of standard therapy affect clinical trial participation, we randomized 282 female cancer patients to one of two versions of a clinical vignette describing a choice between standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (5FU) (CMF) and a randomized trial comparing CMF with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5FU (CAF). The vignettes differed only on whether results with CMF were described verbally or numerically in terms of disease-free survival (DFS). After selecting CMF or the trial, patients estimated their 10-year DFS with CMF. Patients were randomized 3:1 to the verbal vignette. The trial was selected by 110 of 210 (52.4%) verbal vignette patients versus 25 of 72 (34.7%) numeric vignette patients (P = .01). Estimates of 10-year DFS with CMF varied considerably; many were inaccurate. When patients in the verbal vignette group were divided into thirds according to DFS estimate, 22 of 64 (34.4%) in the top third selected the trial versus 38 of 64 (59.4%) and 38 of 65 (58.5%) in the middle and bottom third, respectively (P = .005). Younger age, college education, and previous participation in a trial also predicted trial selection. Multivariate logistic regression suggested that the benefit expected from CMF was more important than how benefit was described in treatment selection. Assuring realistic patient expectations of standard adjuvant therapy benefit is likely to be important during discussion of clinical trials.\r"

A second aim was to determine whether AC followed in 6 months by intravenous (IV) CMF was more effective than AC without reinduction therapy. Through 3 years of follow-up, findings from 2,194 patients indicate no significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS, P = .5), distant disease-free survival (DDFS, P = .5) or survival (S, P = .8) among the three groups. Since the outcome from AC and CMF was almost identical, the issue arises concerning which regimen is more appropriate for the treatment of breast cancer patients. AC seems preferable since, following total mastectomy, AC was completed on day 63 versus day 154 for conventional CMF; patients visited health professionals three times as often for conventional CMF as for AC; women on AC received therapy on each of 4 days versus on each of 84 days for conventional CMF; and nausea-control medication was given for about 84 days to conventional CMF patients versus for about 12 days to patients on AC. The difference in the amount of alopecia between the two treatment groups was less than anticipated. While alopecia was almost universally observed following AC therapy, 71% of the CMF patients also had hair loss and, in 41%, the loss was greater than 50%. This study and NSABP B-16, which evaluates the worth of AC therapy in TAM-responsive patients, indicate the merit of 2 months of AC therapy for all positive-node breast cancer patients.\r"

All the children also received vincristine in identical dose schedules for the first 10 weeks. The frequency of severe hepatic toxicity encountered in the early weeks of therapy was 14.3% (five of 35) among patients treated with 60 micrograms/kg of AMD, 3.7% (four of 108) among patients given 45 micrograms/kg, and 2.8% (five of 176) among patients treated with 15 micrograms/kg per dose times five doses (P = .025). The data suggest an increased frequency of severe hepatic toxicity with the higher, single-dose schedule of administration. However, the frequency of severe hepatic toxicity among the patients in the two remaining groups is markedly higher than the 0.4% observed among similar unirradiated patients in NWTS-3. The relationship of this toxicity to factors such as anesthetic agents, blood transfusions, intercurrent viral infection, or other presently unrecognized causes can be further evaluated only with a detailed investigation such as a case-control study.\r"

There were no differences in survival among the three highest total-dose arms. Comparisons with results in similar patients treated with 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.0 Gy 5 days per week for 6 weeks suggest benefit from HFX radiation therapy with 69.6 Gy.

  ".W": "We analyzed the 2,580-patient Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) small-cell lung cancer data base from 1976 to 1988 in order to (1) determine the prognostic value of favorable demographic and tumor-related factors and therapy programs using Cox multivariate analyses in limited- and extensive-stage disease (LD, ED), and (2) define patient subgroups with significantly different survivals using recursive partitioning and amalgamation (RPA) analysis to refine the current two-stage system. Cox multivariate models were applied to 1,363 patients in six LD trials: good performance status, female sex, age less than 70 years, white race, and normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significant favorable independent predictors. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy was also a strong independent predictor of survival. For 1,217 patients in four ED trials, a normal LDH, treatment with an intensive multidrug regimen, and a single metastatic lesion were favorable independent variables in the Cox model. RPA analysis of 1,137 patients in recent LD and ED trials resulted in a regression tree in which the most important prognostic split was LD versus ED. Normal or abnormal LDH, absence or presence of a pleural effusion, and age less than 70 or greater than or equal to 70 years were important in LD, but only LDH was significant in ED. The terminal nodes of the regression tree were amalgamated to form four distinct prognostic subgroups with median survivals of 19.0, 12.5, 10.5, and 6.3 months (P less than .0001). The best survival occurred for younger patients with \"true\" LD: no effusion and normal LDH. The two intermediate patient subgroups had either LD or ED but still lived significantly longer than those patients with true ED (elevated LDH). This analysis suggests that although several factors were independent prognostic variables in LD in the Cox models, a smaller number of variables can be used to form important prognostic subgroups through RPA. The LDH emerged as a highly significant factor, but performance status and sex did not. A refinement of the current staging system should be made if our results can be confirmed with a combined-group data base analysis.\r"

  ".U": "90362174\r", 
  ".W": "Six hundred fourteen previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma were evaluated on this phase III Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial. For remission induction, two noncross-resistant drug combinations (vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone [VMCP] and vincristine, carmustine [BCNU], Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH], and prednisone [VBAP]) were administered with either a direct alternating or a syncopated schedule. Pretreatment serum beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2M) was the single most important prognostic factor for survival (P less than .0001). There was no difference in toxicity, response, or survival by induction chemotherapy schedule (P greater than .7). For consolidation, 180 eligible and responsive patients were randomized to receive either an additional year of VMCP or sequential hemibody radiation (HBI) with vincristine and prednisone (VP) administered between the two HBI courses. Relapse-free survival (26 months) and overall survival (median, 36 months) were better with VMCP than with HBI (median, 20 months and 28 months; P = .04 and .018, respectively). HBI was also evaluated on a nonrandomized basis in 66 patients who achieved either a partial response (PR) or who were nonresponders to induction therapy. While HBI converted 24% of the PR patients to remission status, this effect was only seen in 5% of nonresponding patients. The survival of responsive and nonresponding patients receiving HBI was similar. All HBI groups had an inferior outcome to those receiving VMCP consolidation. Myelosuppression was also significantly worse after HBI. Survival from the time of relapse did not differ between patients randomized to receive VMCP or HBI. Thus HBI induced less durable remissions, but did not render patients less amenable to postrelapse chemotherapy. Our findings do not support the use of HBI in either chemotherapy responsive or nonresponding patients with multiple myeloma.\r"

Episodes of fever or suspected sepsis were evaluated to determine whether the addition of vancomycin to the flush solution would alter the incidence of symptomatic bacteremia attributed to luminal colonization of TCVC with vancomycin-susceptible bacteria. Patients were enrolled for 247 +/- 150 days, accounting for a total of 11,095 days of catheter use. Bacteremia attributed to luminal colonization with vancomycin-susceptible organisms occurred in five patients (six infections) receiving H alone compared with zero patients receiving H-V (P = .035). The time to the first episode of bacteremia with vancomycin-susceptible organisms, analyzed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves, was significantly longer in patients receiving H-V (P = .04). There were no differences in the incidence of other infections including bacteremia attributed to luminal colonization with vancomycin-resistant organisms, other bacteremias (including those arising from the catheter exit site), exit-site cellulitis, or fungal infections. No organisms resistant to vancomycin were identified. Vancomycin could not be detected in the peripheral blood of patients receiving vancomycin in the flush solution. No vancomycin-related toxicities were noted. We conclude that the use of an H-V flush solution in immunocompromised patients with TCVC can decrease the frequency of bacteremia attributed to luminal colonization with vancomycin-susceptible bacteria.\r"

  ".W": "This study was undertaken to test the glycemic response of five infants with glycogen storage disease type 1, aged 0.7 to 1.5 years, to uncooked cornstarch under various dietary conditions, and to evaluate the long-term effects of a dietary regimen consisting of uncooked cornstarch in milk every 4 hours, in addition to three meals daily, on biochemical values and physical growth. The results were compared with previous experience in treating six infants with continuous overnight glucose infusion via gastrostomy plus multiple daily feedings containing an adequate source of glucose. A test dose of cornstarch (1.6 to 1.8 gm/kg) providing four times the calculated hourly glucose production rate, when given in water 15 to 30 minutes after a continuous overnight intragastric glucose infusion was stopped, did not maintain normoglycemia. When the same dose was given in 2% cow milk 4 hours later, mean blood glucose levels remained greater than 68 mg/dl (3.8 mmol/L) for up to 4 hours. A regimen of uncooked cornstarch in 2% cow milk at 4-hour intervals in addition to three meals daily prevented hypoglycemia, and maintained blood lactate at nearly normal levels and serum uric acid and cholesterol within the normal range; triglyceride levels were increased only modestly. Overnight blood glucose levels were comparable to those achieved with continuous intragastric glucose infusion. With this regimen the five infants have maintained linear growth rates normal for their age and genetic potential; the mean percentage of ideal body weight for length percentile did not change significantly, although two of the five patients were overweight (123% and 124% of ideal body weight respectively) after 3 years of treatment. We conclude that a trial of uncooked cornstarch in feedings of milk every 4 hours should be attempted as soon as a more frequent feeding schedule with dextrose-containing formulas proves ineffective, because the former has the potential to provide the continuous glucose required by infants with glycogen storage disease type 1 in a safer and less invasive fashion than continuous intragastric glucose infusion.\r"

The main criterion of efficacy was the seizure recurrence rate 1 year after the first seizure. The duration of the study was 3 years; eight different centers in France participated. There were 462 febrile episodes and 1000 days with prophylactic treatment. The recurrence rates did not differ between the diazepam group (16%) and the placebo (19.5%) group. The children with recurrent seizures were significantly younger at the time of the first seizure (17 +/- 6.9 months) than children without a recurrent seizure (21 +/- 8.5 months). In children with recurrent seizures, prophylactic treatment was correctly administered to only 1 of 15 children in the diazepam group and to 7 of 18 children in the placebo group. The following were the reasons for this poor cooperation: convulsion being the first manifestation of the fever (seven cases in each group), parents neglecting to give treatment (nine cases), and refusal to take treatment by two children. Side effects were similar in the two groups except for hyperactivity, which was more frequent in the diazepam (138 days) than in the placebo (34 days) group. Intermittent oral administration of diazepam at the onset of fever offered no advantage over placebo in preventing recurrence of seizure. This finding probably reflects a lack of efficacy of the intermittent method rather than of diazepam itself.\r"

However, marked discrepancies in the predictive value of in vitro chemosensitivity assays have been described, suggesting that factors other than the inherent chemosensitivity of tumor cells significantly influence the outcome of chemotherapy in vivo. These factors include the influence of drug pharmacokinetics and metabolism, together with numerous problems associated with the biology of solid tumors in vivo (e.g., drug penetration barriers, proliferation gradients, and microenvironmental conditions). These additional factors may be highly significant in explaining the site-dependent nature of the responses of solid tumors to cytotoxic drugs, the poor prediction of responses in experimental tumor models, and the differences in the responses of multicellular spheroids and monolayers. These discrepancies suggest that the selection of compounds for phase II clinical trials on the basis of disease-specific activity in vitro may be premature.\r"

The major flaw is that the efficacy of spiramycin in preventing contamination of the fetus, or at least in reducing the extent of the infection, has never been evaluated in a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial. Its evaluation would require the follow-up of children born to mothers contaminated during pregnancy for more than 6 months, a goal that is difficult to obtain in current practice. The cost of the programme depends largely on the proportion of non-immune women of childbearing age. Since the modes of contamination are known and are linked to living habits, it should be possible to reduce the risk of infection during pregnancy by adequate health education. This approach is still to be evaluated.\r"

IgG antibody to the two P vivax circumsporozoite proteins was detected in 217 of 804 test sera (27%).

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most frequent life-threatening opportunistic infection associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To assess the possible value of aerosolized-pentamidine prophylaxis in different doses, a controlled clinical trial was begun in 1987 with 408 subjects at 12 treatment centers. The participants were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg of pentamidine every two weeks, 150 mg every two weeks, or 300 mg every four weeks. RESULTS. Eighteen months after randomization, the subjects in the 300-mg arm had had 8 confirmed episodes of PCP while receiving treatment, as compared with 22 in the 30-mg arm (P = 0.0008). The 150-mg arm had intermediate results but ones not significantly different from those of the 300-mg arm. Participants with previous episodes of PCP and CD4-cell counts less than 200 per cubic millimeter were at the highest risk for PCP. CONCLUSIONS. Aerosolized pentamidine was effective for prophylaxis against PCP in patients infected with HIV, according to the dose and schedule of administration. It and zidovudine were well tolerated together and had independent prophylactic benefits.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Beta carotene has been associated with a decreased risk of human cancer in many studies employing dietary questionnaires or blood measurements, and it has had protective effects in some animal models of carcinogenesis. METHODS. We tested the possible cancer-preventing effects of beta carotene by randomly assigning 1805 patients who had had a recent nonmelanoma skin cancer to receive either 50 mg of beta carotene or placebo per day and by conducting annual skin examinations to determine the occurrence of new nonmelanoma skin cancer. RESULTS. Adherence to the prescribed treatment was good, and after one year the actively treated group's median plasma beta carotene level (3021 nmol per liter) was much higher than that of the control group (354 nmol per liter). After five years of follow-up, however, there was no difference between the groups in the rate of occurrence of the first new nonmelanoma skin cancer (relative rate, 1.05; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.91 to 1.22). In subgroup analyses, active treatment showed no efficacy either in the patients whose initial plasma beta carotene level was in the lowest quartile or in those who currently smoked. There was also no significant difference between treated and control groups in the mean number of new nonmelanoma skin cancers per patient-year. CONCLUSIONS. In persons with a previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, treatment with beta carotene does not reduce the occurrence of new skin cancers over a five-year period of treatment and observation.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND. Patients with head-and-neck cancers who are free of disease after local therapy remain at high risk for both recurrent and second primary tumors. Retinoids have proved efficacious in the treatment of premalignant oral lesions and are promising agents for the prevention of epithelial carcinogenesis. METHODS. We prospectively studied 103 patients who were disease-free after primary treatment for squamous-cell cancers of the larynx, pharynx, or oral cavity. After completion of surgery or radiotherapy (or both), these patients were randomly assigned to receive either isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) (50 to 100 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day) or placebo, to be taken daily for 12 months. RESULTS. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of local, regional, or distant recurrences of the primary cancers. However, the isotretinoin group had significantly fewer second primary tumors. After a median follow-up of 32 months, only 2 patients (4 percent) in the isotretinoin group had second primary tumors, as compared with 12 (24 percent) in the placebo group (P = 0.005). Multiple second primary tumors occurred in four patients, all of whom were in the placebo group. Of the 14 second cancers, 13 (93 percent) occurred in the head and neck, esophagus, or lung. CONCLUSIONS. Daily treatment with high doses of isotretinoin is effective in preventing second primary tumors in patients who have been treated for squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck, although it does not prevent recurrences of the original tumor.\r"

  ".W": "The int-1 proto-oncogene was first identified as a gene activated in virally induced mouse mammary tumours. Expression studies, however, suggest that the normal function of this gene may be in spermatogenesis and in the development of the central nervous system. Genes sharing sequence similarity with int-1 have been found throughout the animal kingdom. For example, int-1 has 54% amino-acid identity to the Drosophila segment polarity gene wingless (wg). Both the int-1 and wg gene products seem to be secreted proteins, presumably involved in cell-cell signalling. We have now explored the function of int-1 in the mouse by disrupting one of the two int-1 alleles in mouse embryo-derived stem cells using positive-negative selection. This cell line was used to generate a chimaeric mouse that transmitted the mutant allele to its progeny. Mice heterozygous for the int-1 null mutation are normal and fertile, whereas mice homozygous for the mutation may exhibit a range of phenotypes from death before birth to survival with severe ataxia. The latter pathology in mice and humans is often associated with defects in the cerebellum. Examination of int-1-/int-1- mice at several stages of embryogenesis revealed severe abnormalities in the development of the mesencephalon and metencephalon indicating a prominent role for the int-1 protein is in the induction of the mesencephalon and cerebellum.\r"

  ".W": "Gray and white matter of the mammalian CNS are both damaged by anoxia. Anoxic injury in gray matter is mediated in part by excessive accumulation of excitotoxins like glutamate. Drugs such as ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic known to block glutamate (NMDA) receptors, reduce hypoxic neuronal injury in gray matter. In this study we used the isolated rat optic nerve preparation to determine if ketamine influences recovery after anoxia in a nonsynaptic system, ie, CNS white matter. Optic nerves from adult rats were exposed to a standard 60-minute period of anoxia. Ketamine (1 mM) improved recovery of the compound action potential (CAP) after anoxia. Since glutamate and aspartate (up to 10 mM) had no effect on CAP amplitude in the optic nerve, the effect of ketamine is probably not mediated by NMDA receptor blockade. These observations indicate that ketamine is able to protect CNS white matter, as well as gray matter, from anoxic injury.\r"

Bovine GH is not biologically active in humans, and oral toxicity studies have demonstrated that rbGH is not orally active in rats, a species responsive to parenterally administered bGH. Recombinant bGH treatment produces an increase in the concentration of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in cow's milk. However, oral toxicity studies have shown that bovine IGF-I lacks oral activity in rats. Additionally, the concentration of IGF-I in milk of rbGH-treated cows is within the normal physiological range found in human breast milk, and IGF-I is denatured under conditions used to process cow's milk for infant formula. On the basis of estimates of the amount of protein absorbed intact in humans and the concentration of IGF-I in cow's milk during rbGH treatment, biologically significant levels of intact IGF-I would not be absorbed.\r"

  ".W": "Mutations of the p53 gene occur commonly in colorectal carcinomas and the wild-type p53 allele is often concomitantly deleted. These findings suggest that the wild-type gene may act as a suppressor of colorectal carcinoma cell growth. To test this hypothesis, wild-type or mutant human p53 genes were transfected into human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. Cells transfected with the wild-type gene formed colonies five- to tenfold less efficiently than those transfected with a mutant p53 gene. In those colonies that did form after wild-type gene transfection, the p53 sequences were found to be deleted or rearranged, or both, and no exogenous p53 messenger RNA expression was observed. In contrast, transfection with the wild-type gene had no apparent effect on the growth of epithelial cells derived from a benign colorectal tumor that had only wild-type p53 alleles. Immunocytochemical techniques demonstrated that carcinoma cells expressing the wild-type gene did not progress through the cell cycle, as evidenced by their failure to incorporate thymidine into DNA. These studies show that the wild-type gene can specifically suppress the growth of human colorectal carcinoma cells in vitro and that an in vivo-derived mutation resulting in a single conservative amino acid substitution in the p53 gene product abrogates this suppressive ability.\r"

Interphase mapping was able to extend the ability to resolve and order sequences up to two orders of magnitude beyond localization on banded or unbanded chromosomes. Sequences within the human dystrophin gene separated by less than 100 kb to 1 Mb were visually resolved at interphase by means of standard microscopy. In contrast, distances in the 1-Mb range could not be ordered on the metaphase chromosome length. Analysis of sequences 100 kb to 1 Mb apart indicates a strong correlation between interphase distance and linear DNA distance, which could facilitate a variety of gene-mapping efforts. Results estimate chromatin condensation up to 1 Mb and indicate a comparable condensation for different cell types prepared by different techniques.\r"

In a double blind study 25 patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis taking maintenance oral corticosteroids were randomly allocated to receive 5 mg natamycin or placebo by nebuliser twice daily for one year. The primary aim of the study was to assess the steroid sparing potential of natamycin. Standardised reductions in corticosteroid dosage were therefore undertaken every five weeks, unless clinically contraindicated. Five patients were withdrawn in the first four months: two (1 natamycin, 1 placebo) died, two (1 natamycin, 1 placebo) had suspected drug reactions, and one (natamycin) was non-compliant. The pretreatment characteristics of the 20 patients (10 in each group) who completed the study were similar, 17 (9 natamycin, 8 placebo) having evidence of recent disease activity. At the end of the study prednisolone dose had been reduced by a similar amount in each group (median natamycin 2.25 mg, placebo 2.5 mg). Evidence of disease activity during the study year (transient shadowing on the chest radiograph, blood eosinophilia, or increases in antibodies to A fumigatus, or any combination of these) was observed in similar numbers of patients in each group (5 natamycin, 7 placebo). There was no evidence that natamycin conferred benefit on these patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.\r"

Gemfibrozil reduces the serum triglyceride level and raises the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, but has only a moderate effect on the serum cholesterol level. Nicotinic acid lowers serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels and raises serum HDL levels, but its use is limited because of troublesome side effects, notably a flushing reaction. Probucol lowers both serum LDL and HDL levels and is a second-line agent for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.\r"

In this study, the neurohumoral profiles of 36 asymptomatic patients in the early convalescent phase after acute myocardial infarction were examined. All patients in the study had a radionuclide ejection fraction less than or equal to 45% and underwent cardiac catheterization 11 to 30 days after infarction. Venous blood samples were obtained in the supine state for the measurement of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, plasma renin activity and aldosterone in all patients. Despite the reduced ejection fraction and extensive wall motion abnormalities, plasma norepinephrine was not elevated and did not correlate with any measured hemodynamic, angiographic or clinical variables. The renin-angiotensin II aldosterone system was activated, as expected, in the 9 study patients receiving loop diuretics. However, even in the 27 patients not taking diuretics, plasma angiotensin II and renin activity levels were increased in relation to Killip classification, the presence of a left ventricular (LV) aneurysm and LV ejection fraction. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can be identified in hemodynamically compensated postinfarction patients not taking diuretics and appears to be related to the extent of LV dysfunction.\r"

For this reason, beta blockade is proposed to be useful in CHF. Bucindolol is a new beta blocker that has intrinsic nonadrenergically-mediated vasodilation and may be valuable in treatment of CHF. To test this, 19 patients with CHF were randomized in a double-blind protocol to 3 months of treatment with bucindolol (n = 12) or placebo (n = 7). Significant improvement was seen in the bucindolol group using invasive and noninvasive tests; treadmill time increased from 445 to 530 seconds (p = 0.04), Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score improved from 61 to 40 (p = 0.0001), cardiac output increased from 4.0 to 4.7 (p = 0.02), and systemic vascular resistance decreased from 1,888 to 1,481 (p = 0.04). Also, peak exercise heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased significantly with treatment. There were no changes in the placebo group. We conclude that bucindolol may be an effective treatment for CHF when administered chronically and that its nonadrenergic vasodilation may be an important feature.\r"

  ".W": "Bepridil is a calcium antagonist that prolongs the duration of ventricular repolarization, whereas CERM 4205, another calcium antagonist, seems to be devoid of any effect on QT interval. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of bepridil and CERM 4205 on the QT-RR relation at different heart rates during rest and exercise and the results of pharmacologic tests designed to vary neurovegetative tone. Twelve healthy men (21 to 37 years) participated in a placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, double-blind study and received either bepridil (200 mg/day twice daily) or CERM 4205 (200 mg/day twice daily), or matching placebo during three 14-day treatment periods at 2-week intervals. Bepridil, but not CERM 4205, caused a significant prolongation of resting QT interval. The RR-QT relation was monoexponential for all subjects during resting and exercising physiologic conditions and remained unchanged after 14 days with placebo or CERM 4205. Bepridil significantly shifted the relation upward, resulting in a rate-dependent QT prolongation that predominated during bradycardia. After isoprenaline, QT no longer adapted to changes in heart rate, whereas atropine resulted in a rate-dependent shortening in QT. These results suggest that bepridil and CERM 4205 exert different effects on ventricular repolarization, since only bepridil significantly prolonged QT duration. Bepridil-induced prolongation of QT increased at slow heart rates, which could explain the greater incidence of torsades de pointes in bradycardia.\r"

This is now well established by multiple clinical trials using a variety of interventions including diet and lipid-lowering drugs. Dietary studies in Los Angeles and in Oslo, Norway, have induced a reduction in blood cholesterol of between 10 and 15% with correlated reductions in coronary disease of 20 to 50%. Both niacin and clofibrate in separate cohorts demonstrated a significant reduction in new MI during 5 years of treatment in the Coronary Drug Project. Similar reductions in new MI occurred in the World Health Organization Study with clofibrate. However, in this trial and different from all other trials, mortality in the drug-treatment group actually increased. This finding remains unexplained. In the more recent Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial using the bile acid-binding resin cholestyramine, only a 9% reduction in total cholesterol resulted in a highly significant reduction in the major end points--MI and sudden death--as well as in other secondary end points, including the need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery, ischemic changes on exercise electrocardiography and new-onset angina. Recently, another primary prevention trial using gemfibrozil produced a similar reduction in total cholesterol but a much more significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The reduction in coronary heart disease was in excess of 34% and was strongly related to both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and high-density lipoprotein elevation. Combination drug studies have produced larger reductions in total cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These drugs should be prescribed only after nonpharmacologic interventions (reduction of saturated fat and cholesterol consumption, weight reduction, aerobic exercise, cessation of cigarette smoking) have failed to achieve an adequate effect. The plasma concentration of the atherogenic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) may be reduced in hypercholesterolemic patients by increasing hepatic LDL receptor synthesis (bile acid sequestering resins, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) or by reducing hepatic very low density lipoprotein synthesis (gemfibrozil, nicotinic acid). LDL concentration may also be reduced by treatment with one of the fibrates (e.g., fenofibrate). Several classes of lipid-lowering drugs also increase the plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration. In the case of the fibrates, this appears to be principally mediated through an increase in lipoprotein lipase activity. Gemfibrozil additionally stimulates apolipoprotein AI synthesis. The increase in HDL cholesterol produced by nicotinic acid is due primarily to decreased clearance of HDL particles from the circulation. The increase in HDL concentration produced by gemfibrozil was shown in the Helsinki Heart Study to make a major contribution to a reduced incidence of coronary artery disease, independently of that made by the decrease in LDL. The Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study demonstrated that combined therapy with a resin (colestipol) and nicotinic acid can reduce the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the development of graft lesions in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\r"

  ".W": "Triglycerides are transported by the largest and most lipid-rich of the lipoprotein particles, namely, chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins (VLDL). These particles are buoyant because of the high triglyceride content, which makes up approximately 90% by weight of the chylomicron and 70% by weight of the VLDL. The chylomicron transports exogenous or dietary fat and cholesterol, whereas VLDL transports endogenous triglyceride and cholesterol in lipoproteins synthesized and secreted by the liver. Both chylomicrons and VLDL are hydrolyzed at the capillary surface by the enzyme lipoprotein lipase. Lipoprotein lipase catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglyceride in the lipid core of these particles, producing smaller particles known as remnants. We currently believe the remnants are atherogenic and that this is one reason why hypertriglyceridemia may predispose to coronary artery disease. Chylomicron remnants are recognized and removed by hepatic receptors that contain apolipoprotein (apo) E. The rate of clearance of remnant particles depends on which subfraction of apo E is present. Particles containing apo EII are removed more slowly than those with apo EIII and EIV. The dietary cholesterol from the chylomicron remnant particles is thought to down-regulate the hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. VLDL remnants, also called intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), contain apo E and may be removed by the liver through the LDL or B/E receptor. The decrease in activity of these receptors results in apparent oversynthesis of LDL, the end-product of VLDL and IDL metabolism. LDL is the major cholesterol carrier, followed by high-density lipoprotein (HDL).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The epidemiologic evidence linking high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels with coronary artery disease (CAD) is persuasive. Case-control studies have shown CAD patients to have lower HDL levels than control subjects. Several large-scale, observational epidemiologic studies in the United States and abroad have shown a strong independent inverse relation between HDL and CAD. Women have a lower incidence of CAD than men of the same age; this has been attributed to their higher HDL levels. Postmenopausal women taking estrogen replacement therapy have higher HDL and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and a much lower incidence of CAD. Statistical analysis suggests that much of this is attributable to HDL levels. In several clinical trials, reduced levels of total or LDL cholesterol have been accompanied by increased HDL levels. Cox proportional hazards analysis suggests that the increment in HDL levels made an independent contribution to the reduction in CAD risk. In several angiographic studies, the increase in HDL may have contributed to the decreased progression, increased stabilization and possible regression of coronary lesions. Despite this range of impressive evidence, a number of unresolved issues have prevented the emergence of a consensus regarding the prevention of CAD by increasing HDL levels. Between-population comparisons of HDL and CAD do not match the within-population relations. Animal research on the relation between HDL, atherogenesis and CAD has been relatively scanty. Although much evidence suggests that reverse cholesterol transport partially explains the protective effect of HDL, there are still doubts as to its role. Problems with measurement of HDL have inhibited widespread recommendations for its use in prevention programs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Increased LDL and decreased HDL cholesterol levels are associated with an increase in CAD. Such relations are independent of the usual coronary risk factors, such as cigarette use and hypertension. A 1% greater LDL value is associated with slightly more than a 2% increase in CAD over 6 years; a 1% lower HDL value is associated with a 3 to 4% increase in CAD. Even at total cholesterol levels less than 200 mg/dl, lower HDL levels are associated with increased myocardial infarction rates in both men and women. Death from CAD is increased when HDL levels are low, but there is no such relation between HDL level and cancer death. Triglyceride levels were associated with CAD in Framingham men and women, but the association was no longer significant in men after adjustment for HDL levels. The major determinants for greater HDL levels in Framingham participants included female sex, estrogen use, leanness, greater alcohol intake, exercise, abstinence from smoking and lack of diuretic or beta-blocker use.\r"

The present study was done to determine whether doubling the GH dose would enhance its anabolic effects and facilitate fat loss. Eight women (33-83% over IBW) were fed 12 kcal/kg IBW for 14 wk. They received GH or vehicle injections, each for 5 wk during either weeks 2-6 or 9-13. GH improved nitrogen balance (GH, 3.6 +/- 123.2 mmol/d; vehicle, -132.0 +/- 117.9 mmol/d; means +/- SD; p less than 0.001). Plasma IGF-I increased from 32.1 +/- 9.6 to 79.4 +/- 22.1 nmol/L by day 5 of GH (p less than 0.001) and remained elevated until GH injections were discontinued. No significant effect of GH on mean body fat loss was observed. GH can induce significant anabolic responses even when caloric intake is decreased to 12 kcal/kg IBW. The degree and duration of these anabolic responses are dependent on the GH dose given.\r"

On six occasions eight weight-stable subjects consumed a standard evening meal (109 g carbohydrate, 27 g protein, 6 g fat, and 10.6 g fiber) that was either unsupplemented or supplemented with 41 g fat (safflower oil, olive oil, butter, or medium-chain triglyceride) or 75 g carbohydrate followed by a standard breakfast. Glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid responses were measured over 3 h. There were no differences in metabolic responses to the standard breakfast after the different evening meals, indicating that a single high-fat meal has no deleterious effects on carbohydrate metabolism 12 h later, regardless of the type of fat ingested.\r"

Because diet has been implicated, a search was conducted of published individual assessments of food intake since 1920. One hundred seventy-one studies, ranging from 8 to 20,000 subjects and covering all ages, all ethnic groups, and both sexes, were analyzed by regression, with values weighted by number of subjects in each study. Results show fat intakes rising from approximately 34% energy in the 1930s to 40-42% in the late 1950s to mid 1960s then falling steadily to approximately 36% energy in 1984. This trend was seen for all age and sex groups. Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid intakes fell from 18-20% energy in the early 1950s to 12-13% energy in 1984 whereas polyunsaturated fatty acid intakes rose from 2-4% energy to 7.5%. These results differ markedly from food supply trends and indicate a fall in US fat intake, which preceded the decline in heart disease mortality.\r"

Changes observed in serum cholesterol were greater than those predicted (by the formulas of Hegsted and Keys) for subjects with initial serum cholesterol values in the upper tertile of the population, were not significantly different from those predicted for subjects with baseline values in the middle tertile, and were significantly less than those predicted for subjects with initial values in the lower tertile.

FO feeding significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased the serum n - 6 FAs, linoleic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, and arachidonic acid. A significant increase in the n - 3 FAs, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, was noted in serum, platelet, and neutrophil phospholipids. The 20-g-FO group showed a 30% decrease (p less than 0.01) in triglycerides after 2 wk FO with no further decrease observed.

Whole-body-leucine turnover, leucine oxidation, and nonoxidative leucine disappearance were measured by use of a constant infusion of 1-13C-leucine. Before bed rest, the higher-protein diet resulted in a 14% decrease in whole-body-leucine turnover and a 28% decrease in leucine oxidation, but net nonoxidative leucine disappearance was not different on the two diets. A 24% decrease in nonoxidative leucine disappearance was seen in subjects assigned to the lower-protein diet, who had been on bed rest, but on the higher-protein diet, leucine kinetics were unchanged by bed rest. Bed rest does not cause an increase in whole-body-protein breakdown, but decreased whole-body-protein synthesis is demonstrable when dietary protein is low. This decrease is prevented by a higher dietary amount of protein.\r"

Peak plasma glucose concentrations were approximately 25% lower with the LGE meal and the area under the glucose curve was 63% of that obtained for the HGE meal (p less than 0.05). Although the integrated insulin responses of the two meals did not differ, the peak occurred 60 min earlier in the LGE meal (p less than 0.05). The LGE meal may produce a lower glycemic response, in part because of earlier insulin secretion.\r"

Alpha-tocopherol content of plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test (DTH), mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, as well as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, prostaglandin (PG) E2, and serum lipid peroxides were evaluated before and after treatment.

The rarer GAA 2 allozyme has a lower affinity for glycogen and starch but not for lower-molecular-weight substrates. The GAA 2 allozyme can be detected by \"affinity\" electrophoresis in starch gel, since the lower affinity for the starch matrix results in a more rapid migration to the anode. Previously, we have isolated and sequenced the cDNA for GAA and transiently expressed the cDNA in deficient fibroblasts. In order to determine the molecular basis for the GAA 2 allozyme, we constructed a cDNA and a genomic DNA library from a GAA 2 cell line and determined the nucleotide sequence of the coding region. Only a single base-pair substitution of an A for a G at base-pair 271 was found, resulting in substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at codon 91. This amino acid substitution is consistent with the more basic pI of the GAA 2 enzyme. The base-pair substitution also abolishes a Taq-I site, predicting the generation of a larger DNA fragment. This larger Taq-I fragment was also seen in two other individuals expressing the GAA 2 allozyme. A 5' fragment containing the base-pair substitution was ligated to the remaining 3' cDNA from a GAA 1 allele and cloned into an expression vector, and the hybrid cDNA was transiently expressed in SV40-transformed GAA-deficient fibroblasts. The enzyme activity exhibited the altered mobility of the GAA 2 allozyme, as demonstrated by electrophoresis in starch gel.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen patients were immunosuppressed, including nine organ transplant recipients; three were receiving steroids, and two had an underlying malignancy. The remainder were immunocompetent. Thirteen patients had prior surgery at or near the site of infection. M. hominis was isolated from normally sterile sites such as blood or cerebrospinal, pleural, abdominal and joint fluids, and bone. Non-sterile sites of isolation included surgical wounds and pulmonary secretions. The organism was detected in anaerobic cultures of clinical specimens sent to the laboratory for routine bacteriologic culture. Gram stains of fluids or wound drainage revealed neutrophils but no bacteria. Anti-mycoplasmal therapy was effective in eradicating the organism in 13 of 15 patients who were treated. Of those in whom treatment failed, one patient had an antibiotic-resistant isolate and the other had M. hominis isolated from the lung at postmortem after just 2 days of therapy. CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that significant infections due to M. hominis, although uncommon, are not rare, and methods to isolate and identify this organism should be available for general adult medical and surgical populations.\r"

We therefore examined our patient database for patients with congestive heart failure who demonstrated sustained improvement in left ventricular function and associated resolution of signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified 11 patients with severe congestive heart failure (average ejection fraction 21.9 +/- 4.23% (+/- SD) who developed spontaneous, marked improvement over a period of follow-up lasting 4.25 +/- 1.49 years. All 11 patients were initially symptomatic with exertional dyspnea and fatigue for a minimum duration of 3 months. They form a subset of a larger group of 97 patients with chronic congestive heart failure that we have followed with sequential ejection fraction measurements. All 11 patients were treated with digitalis diuretics, and either converting-enzyme inhibitors or a combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine. Ten of the 11 patients had a history consistent with chronic alcoholism, and each reportedly abstained from alcohol during follow-up. RESULTS: During the follow-up period, the average ejection fraction improved in 11 patients from 21.9 +/- 4.23% to 56.64 +/- 10.22%. Late follow-up indicates an average ejection fraction of 52.6 +/- 8.55% for the group. Congestive heart failure resolved in each case. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that selected patients with severe congestive heart failure can markedly improve their left ventricular function in association with complete resolution of heart failure. This appears to be particularly evident in those patients with chronic alcoholism who subsequently abstain.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the current investigation was to study the influence of sulindac and naproxen on renal function and urinary excretion of the stable hydration product of prostacyclin, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, in patients with arthritis and impaired renal function. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design, the effects of 7 days of oral sulindac 200 mg twice a day were compared with naproxen 500 mg in the morning and 250 mg in the evening in 10 patients with polyarthritis and stable impaired renal function. Inulin and para-amino-hippurate sodium were used to calculate glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow. The excretion rate of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was measured in urine collected overnight. After patients ingested drugs in the morning, urine was collected in fractions by spontaneous voiding. Venous blood samples were drawn repeatedly for assay of electrolytes, creatinine, proteins, hormones, and drugs. Grip strength and Ritchie articular index were recorded as indicators of symptomatic antiarthritic effectiveness. RESULTS: Naproxen decreased urine levels of 6-keto PGF1 alpha by 59% (p less than 0.01). Sulindac had no effect on renal prostaglandin excretion. Naproxen reduced the glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow by 18% (p less than 0.05) and 13% (p less than 0.05), respectively, while no significant change was observed during the sulindac treatment periods. Serum levels of creatinine and complement factor D were unaffected by either drug. Plasma renin activity decreased during naproxen and sulindac treatments by 38% (p less than 0.05) and 22% (p less than 0.05). No significant change in plasma aldosterone was observed during the two drug treatments, but urinary aldosterone declined significantly (p less than 0.05) by 34% with naproxen. Albuminuria decreased (p less than 0.05) during both naproxen (41%) and sulindac treatment (72%), while the albumin/creatinine clearance ratio decreased by 59% (p less than 0.05) only during treatment with sulindac. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase in urine was not changed by either drug. Sulindac and naproxen had no discernible effects on base excess, excretion of water, sodium, or potassium, or on osmolal clearance. However, serum potassium increased slightly but significantly (p less than 0.01) during treatment with naproxen. Sulindac sulfide, the active metabolite of sulindac, could not be traced in the urine from any of the patients. Mean arterial blood pressure declined significantly (p less than 0.05) during sulindac treatment but did not change during treatment with naproxen. Both drugs produced equal clinical improvement as measured by grip strength and the Ritchie articular index. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that when sulindac and naproxen are given in clinical equipotent doses to patients with impaired renal function, sulindac does not affect renal prostaglandin synthesis or renal function, whereas naproxen induces suppression of renal prostaglandin synthesis and a further decrease in renal function.\r"

  ".W": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common problem that frequently presents with atypical complaints including nausea, hiccups, globus sensation, chest pain, hoarseness, coughing, or various pulmonary complaints. Diagnosis may be difficult, as these patients often do not have radiographic or endoscopic evidence of esophagitis. In these difficult cases, prolonged esophageal pH monitoring provides an accurate method of quantitating acid reflux parameters and correlating symptoms with reflux episodes in an outpatient setting. Current equipment is compact, durable, and not difficult to use or extremely expensive. Data analysis, with a particular emphasis on acid-exposure time (total, upright, supine), reliably discriminates between abnormal and normal subjects but it is not a perfect \"gold standard\" for gastroesophageal reflux disease. Indications for esophageal pH monitoring include: (1) atypical symptoms of acid reflux with normal endoscopy, (2) typical reflux symptoms unresponsive to medical therapy, and (3) the follow-up of reflux disease after either medical or surgical therapy. This test is currently performed primarily by gastroenterologists, but we believe many other groups may find this technology helpful. To meet these expanding applications, test refinements are necessary, particularly easier methods of placing the pH probe and better standards for defining abnormal pH parameters in older patients. The future for esophageal pH monitoring is bright. This technology has the potential to do for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease what endoscopy has done for the diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease.\r"

Seventy-day-old and 114-day-old female rats, given an infecting inoculum at time of mating, had higher parasitemias and a more severe anemia than age- and sex-matched controls. Under these experimental conditions, the parasitemia went to crisis in all animals and there were no fatal infections. In contrast, all animals died when the infection was initiated 7 days after conception, a timing that brought a coincidence of peak parasitemia and term. Pregnancy during the post-crisis subpatent period did not cause recrudescence. At the time of delivery, the parasitemia was consistently higher in the placental (crush smear) blood than in the peripheral (tail) blood. This difference was greatest in animals giving birth shortly before or 1-2 days after the parasitemic crisis. Very young, compact parasite forms predominated in the placental blood, whereas trophozoites predominated in the peripheral blood.\r"

Ninety-four percent of tumors were T1 or T2 adenocarcinomas with no identified regional metastases. Five-year cancer-specific survival was 89%. Local recurrence was 19%, although more than half of these patients were cured with additional surgery. These results were comparable with those for historical controls treated with abdominoperineal resection (APR). Four pathologic features of the surgical specimen were analyzed to assess their correlation with patient outcome. Positive surgical margins, poorly differentiated histology, and increasing depth of bowel wall invasion were associated with increased local recurrence and decreased survival. Tumor size greater than 3 cm was not a significant factor. When criteria for appropriate patient selection are followed, local excision may provide survival and recurrence rates comparable with those achieved with APR with less morbidity and operative mortality.\r"

The book contains a message of appreciation to Waters, dated October 1937, with the signatures of J. Blomfield, Charles King, and R.R. Macintosh as representatives of anesthesiology in England. Correspondence exists in the archives of the University of Wisconsin-Madison between Macintosh, Professor of Anaesthetics in Oxford, and Waters, Associate Professor in Madison. This reveals that Waters, during his visit to England in 1936, inspired British anesthetists to discover more of Snow's early contributions to anesthesiology, even though Waters himself did not possess On Chloroform and Other Anaesthetics. King, a manufacturer of anesthetic equipment, found a copy in the hands of Blomfield, an anesthetist at St. George's Hospital, London, where John Snow had worked. It was this copy that they presented to Waters, and that was delivered to Waters by hand when Waters' resident, Ivan Taylor, returned from Oxford to Madison. Blomfield's ownership of the book, in addition to his position as president of the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland, explains why the inscription is in his handwriting.\r"

During each infusion, they received a series of five injections (3 ml each) of either saline, 1% lidocaine or 1% lidocaine containing 5, 10, or 15 micrograms of epinephrine. Thirty minutes after completing these two infusions, propranolol was administered as a bolus injection, and the series of five injections repeated. All injections were double blind and randomized. During saline infusion, all injections containing epinephrine significantly increased heart rate (HR) by an average of 31-38 beats/min when compared with that following plain lidocaine (P less than 0.05), and increased systolic blood pressure by an average of 17-26 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for the 15-micrograms dose only). During esmolol infusion, epinephrine injections increased HR by an average of 23-31 beats/min (P less than 0.05), and increased systolic blood pressure by an average of 18-30 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for 10 and 15 micrograms). After propranolol injection, epinephrine injections caused a decrease in HR by an average of 21-28 beats/min (P less than 0.05), whereas systolic blood pressure increased by an average of 22-35 mmHg (P less than 0.05 for 10 and 15 micrograms only).

The effect of neostigmine (70 micrograms/kg) in antagonizing a profound (no-twitch) vecuronium-induced (0.1 mg/kg) NMB in 40 healthy patients was studied. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups specifying the sequence of neostigmine administration. Fifteen minutes after the administration of vecuronium, when there was no detectable twitch response, each patient received either neostigmine (70 micrograms/kg) with glycopyrrolate (15 micrograms/kg) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (placebo). When T1 (the first response in the train-of-four [TOF] sequence) recovered to 10% of control, patients again received either neostigmine with glycopyrrolate in the same doses as before or the placebo. The following variables were measured: times from vecuronium injection until T1 recovered to 10% (t [10]) and 90% (t [90]) of control, and time until the TOF ratio was equal to 75% (t [TOF75]). Mean values of t (90) and t (TOF75) were shorter (54.7-75.2 min and 60.4-79.5 min, respectively) for the three groups who received neostigmine as compared with patients who received two doses of placebo (104.3 and 122.6 min, respectively).

  ".W": "Preschool age children often experience marked anxiety and physical pain during laceration repair. Locally infiltrated anesthetics or topical tetracaine, adrenaline, and cocaine (TAC) usually control the physical pain but have little or no effect on anxiety. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, hypnotic, and antegrade amnestic effects. In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy of midazolam in alleviating anxiety during laceration repair in children less than 6 years old. On admission to the emergency department, anxiety level was determined on a scale of 1 to 4 based on a predetermined behavior criteria. Patients with high anxiety level (3 or 4) received a single oral dose of either midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or placebo. The anxiolytic effect of midazolam was considered adequate if the anxiety level decreased two or more points (from 4 to less than or equal to 2 or from 3 to 1) during laceration repair. In the midazolam group (30), 70% of the children had a two-point or more decrease in anxiety level compared with 12% in the placebo group (25) (P less than .0001). No respiratory depression or other complications were noted in the midazolam group. We conclude that a single oral dose of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective treatment for alleviating anxiety in children less than 6 years old during laceration repair in the ED.\r"

Ketamine sedation facilitates superior technical and cosmetic results while minimizing emotional trauma to distraught children. The much-feared complications of aspiration and laryngospasm are extremely rare when ketamine is used with proper precautions. Ketamine deserves increased use in the ED, and we advocate additional clinical investigation in this setting.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of syngeneic bone marrow transplantation and peripheral blood lymphocyte infusions combined with zidovudine in the treatment of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. DESIGN: A partially randomized outpatient trial. SETTING: Outpatient and inpatient facility of the Clinical Center of the National Institutes of Health, a research-based referral facility. PATIENTS: Sixteen patients with HIV infection (15 symptomatic, 1 asymptomatic). INTERVENTIONS: Symptomatic patients were treated with zidovudine, 500 mg orally every 4 hours for 12 weeks, combined with six peripheral blood lymphocyte infusions (four at week 10, two at week 12) and bone marrow transplantation (at week 12) using HIV-seronegative identical twins as donors. After transplantation, patients were randomly assigned to receive either zidovudine, 100 mg every 4 hours, or placebo for 12 months. The asymptomatic patient received zidovudine for the first 12 weeks, discontinuing therapy after transplantation. Immunologic and virologic monitoring were done monthly. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Immediately after lymphocyte infusions and bone marrow transplantation, there was an increase in the mean (+/- SE) CD4 cell percent (19.1% +/- 3.1% to 28.1% +/- 3.0%), an increase in the fraction of patients with delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to tetanus toxoid (4 of 13 to 11 of 13) and the development of delayed-type hypersensitivity to keyhole-limpet hemocyanin (a primary immunogen to which only the donor had been immunized) in 8 of 12 patients tested. No significant clinical improvement was noted, however, and there was no overall sustained immunologic improvement. No differences in CD4 cell percents, delayed-hypersensitivity skin tests, HIV cultures, or p24 antigenemia were seen between patients treated with zidovudine or placebo after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Although they establish the feasibility of combining zidovudine with cellular immune reconstitution in treating patients with HIV infection, our results show that any benefits from such combination therapy are at best transient. Future attempts at cellular immune reconstitution may need to use improved antiretroviral regimens as well as immunization of donors with HIV-specific antigens.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized, prospective phase I-II trial. SETTING: A Cooperative Oncology Group trial involving tertiary medical centers. PATIENTS: Twenty of twenty-two patients with measurable, extensive or limited, unresectable thymoma were evaluable for response. INTERVENTION: Patients were given cisplatin, 50 mg/m2 body surface area, doxorubicin, 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide, 500 mg/m2, on day 1, with cycles repeated every 21 days until progression or until the maximally tolerated total doxorubicin dosage (for example, 450 mg/m2) was reached. Intravenous hydration with normal saline was administered during treatment courses. For responding patients with limited disease, 4500 cGy was administered to primary tumors after the second cycle of chemotherapy and before the initiation of the third cycle. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three complete and eleven partial remissions were seen in 20 evaluable patients, for a total response rate of 70% (95% CI, 46% to 88%). The median duration of remission was 13 months with three patients remaining continuously disease free for over 2 years. The median survival time of all eligible patients was 59 months (CI, 22 months to infinity). Four patients developed infections, including listerial and aseptic meningitides, mucocutaneous candidiasis, and cryptococcal pneumonia, that were indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide frequently produces objective remissions in patients with advanced thymoma. Further experience with this treatment regimen is warranted to clarify potential prognostic factors in patients with unresectable thymoma.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the recent advances in the biologic and clinical research of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. DATA IDENTIFICATION: English-language literature search using MEDLINE (1980 to 1990) and CANCERLIT (1980 to 1990), review of meeting abstracts and reports, and an extensive manual search of bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Approximately 800 articles, abstracts, and book chapters were selected for analysis. DATA EXTRACTION: The literature was reviewed and 227 articles were selected as representative of the important advances in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a disease of lymphocytes that appear to be mature but are biologically immature. These B lymphocytes arise from a subset of CD5-B cells that appear to have a role in autoimmunity. The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia is likely a multistep process, initially involving a polyclonal expansion of CD5-B cells followed by transformation of a single cell. Chromosome studies indicate that trisomy 12 is the most common abnormality, followed by 14q+, 13q, and 11q. These abnormalities portend a poor prognosis. Recent progress in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia involves three new drugs: fludarabine, pentostatin, and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. Recent preliminary results of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation present insights into the potential curability of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin can prevent or delay moderate bacterial infections in persons with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Major advances in the biologic research of chronic lymphocytic leukemia have resulted in new understanding of this complex disease. New therapies, such as those with intravenous immunoglobulin and fludarabine, may lead to improved outcome.\r"

By using a previously validated radioassay with gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, a group of protein synthesis inhibitors was evaluated for their effect on microbial growth kinetics. All tested drugs induced changes in both the slopes and intercepts of the growth curves. An exponential growth model was applied to quantify the drug effect on the processes of bacterial 14CO2 liberation and cell generation. The response was measured in terms of a generation rate constant. A linear dependence of the generation rate constant on the dose of spectinomycin was observed with Escherichia coli. Sigmoidal-shaped curves were found in the assays of chloramphenicol and tetracycline. The implications of dose-response curves are discussed on the basis of the receptor site concept for drug action. The assay sensitivities for chloramphenicol and tetracycline were similar to those obtained by the cell counting method, but the sensitivity of the radioassay was at least 10 times greater for spectinomycin.\r"

Four subjects in each of the six dose groups (62.5, 125, 250, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 mg as a 30-min intravenous infusion) received each antibiotic, according to a crossover design, with a 2-day washout period between treatments. Blood and urine samples were obtained to characterize the pharmacokinetics of cefepime. Plasma and urine samples were assayed for intact cefepime. Samples containing ceftazidime were discarded. The adverse effects observed in the study were mild and infrequent, with prompt recovery from adverse experiences and abnormal laboratory values. The cefepime pharmacokinetic parameters for the therapeutically significant doses of 250 to 2,000 mg appeared to be proportional to dose and similar to literature values for ceftazidime. The elimination half-life of about 2 h was independent of the dose. Urinary recovery of intact cefepime was invariant with respect to dose; an overall mean value of 82% of dose was obtained for the four highest levels. Mean renal clearance was 105 ml/min and suggestive of glomerular filtration as the primary excretion mechanism. In normal humans, the safety and pharmacokinetic profiles of cefepime are very similar to those of ceftazidime.\r"

The volume of distribution of tobramycin at steady state was increased by 20% in normal volunteers when given with ceftazidime. The increase in distribution was accompanied by a slight decrease in ceftazidime elimination rate. No additional alteration in dosing over those necessary to adjust for a decrease in renal function is necessary when giving this combination.\r"

Ultrasound examinations of gallbladders were performed on days 1 and 14 of therapy and 2 weeks posttherapy if abnormalities were observed on day 14. Eight patients were unevaluable because of abnormal base-line gallbladder sonograms. Thirty-six patients (ceftriaxone, n = 28; placebo, n = 8) demonstrated normal baseline gallbladder sonograms and were evaluated for the development of change. A total of 6 of 28 (21.4%) ceftriaxone-treated patients and 1 of 8 (12.5%) patients who received the placebo demonstrated abnormal gallbladder sonograms on day 14 (P = 0.491). Four of the six ceftriaxone-treated patients demonstrating abnormal sonograms were clinically asymptomatic, while two patients reported vomiting. The abnormal sonograms of gallbladders of patients treated with ceftriaxone returned to normal between 9 and 26 days posttherapy. These data suggest an association between ceftriaxone treatment and the development of gallbladder abnormalities on ultrasound examination which resolve spontaneously on discontinuation of ceftriaxone therapy.\r"

As inferred from results of Southern hybridization, dissemination of amikacin resistance in Acinetobacter spp. is due to a gene rather than a strain or plasmid epidemic.\r"

The intracellular antimicrobial activities of these drugs were evaluated by determining the numbers of viable organisms remaining within cells after treatment with various drug concentrations. At 0.2 and 0.78 microgram/ml, tosufloxacin suppressed intracellular multiplication of S. enteritidis C-32 more effectively than ofloxacin and norfloxacin did. The ability of tosufloxacin to penetrate into WI-38 cells was also determined by the velocity gradient method. The ratio of the intracellular concentration to the extracellular concentration of tosufloxacin was 1.7- and 2.6-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and norfloxacin, respectively. The results indicate that the potent intracellular bactericidal activity of tosufloxacin may be due not only to its high in vitro activity but also to its ability to penetrate into cells at a high level.\r"

The 50% effective dose for SM-8668 was assessed at 10 days after infection and was 0.18, 3.7, and 5.9 mg/kg (body weight), respectively, for the above-mentioned fungal diseases. Fluconazole was about four times less effective than SM-8668 against systemic candidiasis and was only slightly effective at doses of 80 and 25 mg/kg against systemic aspergilosis and cryptococcosis, respectively. SM-8668 was also about four to eight times more active than fluconazole against vaginal candidiasis in rats and against dermatophytic infection in guinea pigs. In addition, topical SM-8668 was as effective as topical miconazole or tioconazole against skin mycosis in guinea pigs. After oral administration, SM-8668 showed a maximum concentration in serum similar to that of fluconazole in both mice and rats, but the elimination half-life and area under the serum concentration-time curve for SM-8668 were twice those for fluconazole.\r"

B128 was resistant to high levels of gentamicin as well as of all other available aminoglycosides and was also resistant to tetracyclines. No bactericidal synergism was found between ampicillin or vancomycin and any of these aminoglycosides. Gentamicin, kanamycin, streptomycin, and tetracycline resistance determinants transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free group B streptococcus recipient at a frequency of 10(-8) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor cell. No transconjugants were detected when streptococci of groups A, C, and G, Streptococcus sanguis, or Enterococcus faecalis was used as a recipient. No plasmids were detected in B128 or in any of the four transconjugants tested. By DNA-DNA hybridization, homology was detected between gene aac6/aph2, of E. faecalis origin, and a 2.4-kilobase HindIII chromosomal fragment of B128; homology to the genes aph3 and aadE, of E. faecalis origin, was found with HindIII chromosomal fragments of the same size (3.0 kilobases). Strains like B128, which potentially can be responsible for severe neonatal infections, are of great clinical concern, since there are to date no antibiotic combinations exhibiting bactericidal synergism against them.\r"

We confirm that in vivo and at low concentrations, fenpropimorph inhibits delta 8----delta 7-sterol isomerase, and in addition, when it is used at higher concentrations, it inhibits delta 14-sterol reductase. We show also that the fungistatic effect of fenpropimorph is not due to the accumulation of abnormal sterols in treated cells but is linked to the specific inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, leading to the arrest of cell proliferation in the unbudded G1 phase of the cell cycle.\r"

The MICs of this compound for 90% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae tested (MIC90s), including strains resistant to ceftazidime, ranged from 0.1 to 25 micrograms/ml. LJC10,627 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa at an MIC90 of 3.13 micrograms/ml; it thus was twofold more active than imipenem. This compound inhibited Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Branhamella species at MIC90s of 3.13, 0.1, and 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. LJC10,627 was two- to fourfold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at MIC90s of 0.1 and 0.39 microgram/ml. However, the compound was found to be twofold more active than imipenem against Bacteroides fragilis at an MIC90 of 1.56 microgram/ml. LJC10,627 was very stable to various beta-lactamases except for Xanthomonas maltophilia oxyiminocephalosporinase type II. LJC10,627 was minimally hydrolyzed by swine renal dehydropeptidase I; its residual activity was 93.0% after 2 h. Killing kinetics of this compound for Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that bactericidal action occurred at concentrations above the MIC (0.05 and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively). LJC10,627 had a high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2, 4, and 1B(s) of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus.\r"

Hemodynamic and clinical improvements in patients with severe CHF fostered the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in mild to moderate CHF. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors produce acute and sustained improvements in ventricular hemodynamics and quality of life. Captopril plus diuretic therapy is an effective alternative to digoxin in patients with mild to moderate CHF. Enalapril maleate and lisinopril have been shown to be effective in moderate to severe CHF when combined with digoxin and diuretics. Captopril and enalapril also improve survival in selected patients; captopril attenuates left ventricular dilatation after myocardial infarction. Although all angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are similar in mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic differences impact their clinical use. Prolonged symptomatic hypotension compromising systemic perfusion and organ function has been reported with longer-acting agents; hypotension is usually short-lived and rarely compromises organ function with shorter-acting agents.\r"

Lupus-associated protein-losing enteropathy typically occurs in young women, and is characterized by the onset of profound edema and hypoalbuminemia. In many cases it is the first obvious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus. Diarrhea is present about 50% of the time, but steatorrhea is absent. Diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy can be successfully made by radioisotopic studies or 24-hour stool alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. A normal lymphocyte count, elevated serum cholesterol, and absence of lymphangiectasia on intestinal biopsy help distinguish lupus-associated protein-losing enteropathy from protein-losing enteropathies due to direct or indirect lymphatic obstruction. Normal endoscopy and mucosal biopsy can rule out protein loss due to mucosal disruption. Prognosis appears to be excellent with corticosteroids, although other immunosuppressive therapies have been successfully used. A typical and illustrative case is presented as a focal point for review and discussion.\r"

Recent developments at the national health policy level suggest that practice guidelines will play an increasingly prominent role in the practice of medicine. The federal government has created a new US Public Health Service agency with responsibility for practice guidelines. Guidelines have been developed by more than 35 physician organizations and specialty societies. The American Medical Association and the Council of Medical Specialty Societies have endorsed practice guidelines and are organizing specialty societies to set policy on the subject. Academic medical centers have formed a research consortium on practice guidelines. Independent research centers (eg, the RAND Corporation and the Institute of Medicine) are developing methods for assessing appropriateness and setting guidelines. Other groups, such as hospitals, insurers, managed care plans, and private enterprises, are also directly involved. The implications of these developments are far reaching.\r"

Fourteen patients responded to therapy with initial reversal of their respiratory failure. However, nine of these relapsed with recurrence of respiratory failure after steroid therapy was withdrawn. Eight (40%) of the patients remained alive and well 3 months or more following treatment. When the analysis was restricted to patients requiring intubation, only 25% were alive 3 months later.

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) allows patients to self-administer small boluses of narcotic, allowing better dose titration, enhanced responsiveness to variability in narcotic requirements, and reduction in serum narcotic level fluctuation. Although theoretically useful, this method has not bee well studied in the elderly or medically ill. A prospective controlled trial among 83 higher-risk elderly men after major elective surgery compared PCA containing morphine sulfate with intramuscular morphine injections as needed (mean [+/- SD] age, 67.4 +/- 5.6 vs 67.0 +/- 6.3 years). Subjects had a variety of medical illnesses, including chronic lung disease (57%), coronary artery disease (43%), heart failure (13%), and liver disease (12%). Preoperative and postoperative assessments included chest roentgenograms; daily mental status and pulmonary function testing; twice-daily serum morphine levels; and oxygen saturation values, linear analogue pain and sedation scores, and vital signs every 2 hours. Care was taken to optimize narcotic administration in control subjects as well as PCA subjects. Analgesia was significantly improved by PCA (3-day mean pain score, 40.5 +/- 18.0 vs 32.5 +/- 15.0), without an increase in sedation. Significant postoperative confusion (18% vs 2.3%) and severe pulmonary complications (10% vs 0%) occurred significantly more frequently in intramuscular-treated controls. Patient-controlled analgesia was quickly mastered by most patients; no major problems referable to its use occurred. Patients who had previously received intramuscular injections reported that PCA was easier to use and provided better analgesia. Serum morphine levels showed significantly less variability on postoperative day 1 with PCA, compared with intramuscular injections. We conclude that PCA is an improved method of postoperative analgesia in high-risk elderly men with normal mental status, compared with as-needed intramuscular injections.\r"

In the univariate analysis, age, underlying disease, temperature, and white blood cell count at admission to the hospital correlated with a positive needle aspiration culture. A series of logistic regressions were performed to determine if each of these variables was independently associated with a positive needle aspiration culture. The final model demonstrated that underlying disease and body temperature were independent predictors of obtaining a positive needle aspiration culture. Consequently, the addition of white blood cell count and age failed to enhance the model's predictability. For most patients this procedure will not be helpful [corrected] in establishing a bacteriologic diagnosis. On the basis of these results, the needle aspiration technique will most likely yield pathogens in patients with underlying disease that predisposes to the acquisition of cellulitis. These patients may also fail to mount a febrile response to infection.\r"

We used decision analysis to identify the types of allergy history for which skin testing should alter management. The treatment threshold, the probability of a serious allergic reaction at which point one should switch from penicillin to another antibiotic, depends on the quality of life associated with the clinical outcomes. We measured 12 physicians' attitudes toward the outcomes of treatment with penicillin or vancomycin for Streptococcus viridans endocarditis in patients with a history of penicillin allergy. The clinicians' threshold probabilities ranged from .00010 to .00210 (median, .00013). Given the sensitivity (89% to 96%) and specificity (89% to 96%) of skin testing and our clinicians' median threshold, test results could alter the choice of antibiotic when the probability of a severe allergic reaction is between .00001 and .001. This range corresponds to a weak history of penicillin allergy. Although the decision should be individualized, our study suggests that skin testing is unnecessary when the patient has a convincing history of a severe allergic reaction to penicillin.\r"

The two groups did not differ significantly in basal plasma prolactin or cortisol levels. Nevertheless, both the prolactin and cortisol response to oral administration of MK-212 (20 mg) were significantly blunted in the patients with OCD compared with those of the normal controls. MK-212 did not affect the intensity of OCD symptoms. However, MK-212, as compared with placebo, produced slight but statistically significant increases in self-ratings of nausea, dizziness, anxiety, feeling strange, and mixed feelings of calmness and restlessness, as well as depression and feeling high. These behavioral ratings were not significantly different in patients and normal controls. These findings are consistent with previous reports of diminished serotoninergic responsivity in OCD and raise the possibility of subsensitivity of at least some serotonin receptors in this disorder.\r"

Thirty seven consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomised to receive intravenous heparin during (group 1, n = 18) or after (group 2, n = 19) streptokinase (1.5 megaunits over 60 minutes). Markers of reperfusion were monitored every 15 minutes for 3 hours. The serum concentration of creatine kinase was measured every 2 hours. The two groups were similar in terms of age and sex distribution, infarct site, time to treatment, and baseline myocardial ischaemia. Patients in group 1 had a significantly shorter mean (SD) reperfusion time (57 (35) minutes v 101 (47)). From 60 to 120 minutes after randomisation there were significant differences in ST segment elevation between the groups. Serum creatine kinase MB peaked earlier (8 (2) hours) in group 1 than in group 2 (10 (4) hours). The peak concentration was significantly lower in group 1 (87 (47) mU/ml) than in group 2 (134 (96) mU/ml) and infarcts were smaller (25.2 (9.8) gram equivalents/m2) in group 1 than in group 2 (35.1 (10.2) gram equivalents/m2). Simultaneous infusion of heparin and streptokinase speeds up the appearance of signs of reperfusion and reduces infarct size.\r"

Immunoscintigraphy with 99mtechnetium-labelled monoclonal antibody fragments of MoAb 225.28S in 14 patients with melanoma yielded a positive image in only six cases (43%). The expression of high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) was immunohistochemically assessed in melanoma tissue obtained from these 14 patients to find a possible correlation between the results of immunoscintigraphy and expression of the HMW-MAA. The melanoma tissues were immunohistochemically stained by a sensitive immunoperoxidase procedure with three different monoclonal antibodies to the HMW-MAA: 225.28S, Mel-14, and AMF-6. Expression of the antigen detected by MoAb 225.28S was found in 13 of 14 melanomas; the MoAbMel-14 reacted positively with all 14 melanomas; staining with MoAb AMF-6 was achieved in 10 melanomas. No correlation was found between the immunohistochemical staining results, the conventional histopathological findings, and the immunoscintigraphic results. The immunohistochemical staining results suggest that anti-HMW-MAA MoAbs bind to the melanoma tissue and are therefore potentially suitable for immunoscintigraphy.\r"

Unusual non-ocular features found in all patients included tracheomalacia and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle. In two cases tracheomalacia was responsible for respiratory distress after general anaesthesia. Wilms' tumour developed bilaterally in one patient and on the isthmus of a horseshoe kidney in another patient. In addition to the more commonly observed ocular features the presence of a corneal pannus was noted before 38 months of age in all patients and as early as 17 months in one case. An iridocorneal adherence with an overlying corneal opacity (presumably related to abnormal developmental cleavage of the anterior segment) was noted in one eye only of the mosaicism case.\r"

  ".U": "90366684\r", 
  ".W": "One hundred forty-seven consecutive patients with leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or aplastic anemia were treated by marrow grafts from genotypically HLA-identical siblings (n = 122) or HLA-haploidentical family members (n = 25). Haploidentical recipients differed from their donors for no more than one HLA locus on the nonshared haplotype. All were given postgrafting immunosuppression with a combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine. In a randomized study we explored whether prednisone administered from day 0 through 35 along with methotrexate/cyclosporine could improve prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The GVHD incidence in patients not given prednisone was comparable with that previously reported with methotrexate/cyclosporine. Unexpectedly, significant increases in acute and also chronic GVHD were seen in HLA-identical recipients administered prednisone, but not in the small number of patients administered HLA-nonidentical grafts. However, the resultant increase in transplant-related mortality in patients administered prednisone was offset by an increase in leukemic relapse in patients not administered prednisone, presumably related to the absence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Therefore, overall disease-free survival of the two groups of patients was comparable, with slightly more than 50% of the patients being alive at more than 2 years after transplantation. We speculated that prednisone adversely affected GVHD prophylaxis, interfering with methotrexate's cell cycle-dependent suppression of donor lymphocyte proliferation in response to host antigens. In a pilot study we explored whether beginning prednisone on day 15, after completion of methotrexate administration, would avoid this adverse effect. The GVHD incidence in patients administered methotrexate/cyclosporine along with \"late\" prednisone was comparable with that in patients not administered prednisone. We conclude that methotrexate/cyclosporine is effective in decreasing the incidence of grade II through IV GVHD, and that the addition of prednisone to this regimen is not beneficial in recipients of HLA-identical marrow grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) increases neutrophil surface expression of the cellular adhesion molecule CD11b and primes the respiratory burst stimulated by the bacterial peptide f-met-leuphe (FMLP). We have examined the effects of the isoquinolinesulfonamide protein kinase inhibitors H7 and H8 on these functions of GM-CSF using whole blood assays. Concentrations of H7 and H8 that inhibited the 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulated upregulation of CD11b expression and activation of the respiratory burst, both augmented the effects of GM-CSF. H7 and H8 enhanced the GM-CSF-stimulated increase in CD11b expression to 215% +/- 10% (P less than .05) and 233% +/- 45% (P less than .05), respectively, of the value obtained with GM-CSF alone. The GM-CSF priming of the FMLP-stimulated oxidative burst was increased to 190% +/- 44% (P less than .01) by preincubation with H7 and to 172% +/- 25% (P less than .01) with H8. Preincubation with H8 did not affect overall binding of 125I-GM-CSF to neutrophils, but inhibited GM-CSF receptor internalization after ligand binding (P less than .05). These data indicate that the effects of GM-CSF are not mediated by protein kinase C and that a phosphorylation event down-modulates the neutrophil response to GM-CSF. It suggests that internalization of the receptor-ligand complex is not a rate-limiting step in signal transduction, and that regulation of the rate of internalization may be an important level of control of the activity of GM-CSF.\r"

DESIGN--Exploratory study in which active treatment was preceded by placebo. SETTING--Inpatient unit of teaching hospital. PATIENTS--Nine men with uncomplicated essential hypertension who had a normal sodium intake. INTERVENTIONS--Two single intravenous doses of RO 42-5892 (100 and 1,000 micrograms/kg in 10 minutes) given to six patients and one single oral dose (600 mg) given to the three others as well as to three of the patients who also received the two intravenous doses. RESULTS--With both intravenous and oral doses renin activity fell in 10 minutes to undetectably low values, while angiotensin II concentration fell overall by 80-90% with intravenous dosing and by 30-40% after the oral dose. Angiotensin II concentration was back to baseline four hours after the low and six hours after the high intravenous dose and remained low for at least eight hours after the oral dose. Blood pressure fell rapidly both after low and high intravenous doses and after the oral dose and remained low for hours. With the high intravenous dose the daytime (0900-2230), night time (2300-0600), and next morning (0630-0830) systolic blood pressures were significantly (p less than 0.05) lowered by 12.5 (95% confidence interval 5.6 to 19.7), 12.2 (5.4 to 19.3), and 10.7 (3.2 to 18.5) mm Hg respectively, and daytime diastolic pressure was lowered by 9.3 (2.2 to 16.8) mmHg. With the oral dose daytime, night time, and next morning systolic blood pressures were lowered by 10.3 (5.5 to 15.4), 10.5 (4.2 to 17.2), and 9.7 (4.0 to 15.6) mm Hg, and daytime and night time diastolic pressures were lowered by 5.8 (0.9 to 11.0) and 6.0 (0.3-12) mm Hg respectively. CONCLUSIONS--The effect of the inhibitor on blood pressure was maintained over a longer period than its effect on angiotensin II. RO 42-5892 is orally active and has a prolonged antihypertensive effect in patients who did not have sodium depletion. This prolonged effect seems to be independent, at least in part, of the suppression of circulating angiotensin II.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of patients presenting consecutively for radiological investigation of urinary tract infection between October 1988 and December 1989. Both investigations were performed concurrently and performed independently on routine lists by different duty radiologists, each of whom knew the details on the request form but not the findings of the other investigation. SETTING--Radiology department of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--158 Consecutive adults (89 women, 69 men; mean age 49.7 (range 18-83)) referred from general practitioners and hospital outpatient clinics with a history of proved urinary tract infection. INTERVENTIONS--Urography and ultrasonography performed concurrently. When both examinations gave normal findings no clinical or radiological follow up was sought. All abnormal findings detected with either investigation were confirmed by subsequent imaging studies or by operative procedures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Accuracy of detection of abnormalities of urinary system by ultrasonography compared with urography. RESULTS--113 Patients (72%) had normal urographic and ultrasonic findings. Overall, ultrasonography concurred with the findings of urography in 149 (94%) patients, and when a single abdominal radiograph was included in the procedure, in 152 (96%). Ultrasonography missed only one important diagnosis, that of mild papillary necrosis in normal sized kidneys in a diabetic patient. It detected one early bladder tumour not visible on urography and was able to clarify the nature of renal masses (simple cysts) evident on three urograms. CONCLUSION--Ultrasonography provides a safe and accurate method of imaging the urinary tract in adults with infection. Combined with a plain abdominal radiograph, it should replace urography as the initial imaging investigation in these patients. Major savings would result from adopting this policy, and the risks to patients from ionising radiation and intravenous contrast media would be appreciably reduced.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective analysis over six years of cytological predictions compared with histological findings. SETTING--Thyroid clinic serving the Grampian region. PATIENTS--395 Consecutive patients presenting with an isolated thyroid swelling, 307 of whom underwent surgical excision. Analysis was confined to a subgroup of 283 patients with satisfactory aspirates who were operated on. RESULTS--The positive predictive value of aspiration cytology for detecting malignant disease was 100% and the sensitivity 83%. The sensitivity for the detection of neoplasia (frank malignancy together with follicular adenomas) was 76%. The specificity was 58% and the overall accuracy 69%. Recalculation of data in previous papers with strict criteria showed the accuracy of aspiration cytology to be variable and lower than is widely accepted. Since the introduction of aspiration cytology 21% fewer operations for isolated thyroid swellings have been performed. CONCLUSIONS--As a basis of selection for surgical excision of isolated thyroid swellings according to prediction of neoplasia fine needle aspiration cytology is less reliable than is widely accepted. It is an adjunct to management rather than a definitive test, and negative cytological results do not exclude neoplastic disease. Further study should take account of the implications of repeated clinic attendances for review and aspiration as these may culminate in delayed surgical treatment.\r"

All of the coating-positive patients had serum antibody titres greater than or equal to 1:160, the class of antibody being dependent on the urinary Ig levels. The ACB test for candiduria is of little clinical value in indicating invasive Candida UTI as the Candida cells appear to adhere to antibodies in urine contaminated with circulating fluids.\r"

Chronic bacterial prostatitis in this model was associated with sparse glycocalix-enclosed protected bacterial microcolonies within the prostatic acini and ducts which appeared to stimulate a persistent local and systemic immunological reaction resulting in chronic inflammation of the gland. This model has many striking similarities to the natural history of human chronic bacterial prostatitis.\r"

The stent, woven from fine stainless steel in the form of a tubular mesh, was inserted via a delivery device using combined ultrasound and endoscopic control under local anaesthesia. The procedure was well tolerated, the stent becoming covered with epithelium by 6 to 8 months following insertion, yet allowing easy removal within the first 4 to 6 weeks should the need arise. This technique provides a useful alternative to conventional surgical treatment in the high risk patient.\r"

All were considered to be at major risk from prostatic surgery. The 18 patients with acute retention voided spontaneously following the initial stent procedure, but the patient with chronic retention required a period of suprapubic catheterisation. Following the endoscopic insertion of an additional stent this patient also voided spontaneously. During a follow-up period of 3 to 7 months (mean 4), 4 patients were lost to follow-up. The remaining 15 patients all void spontaneously. Recurrent asymptomatic urinary tract infections were seen in all but 1 patient initially, but none of those who were followed up for over 5 months had evidence of infection. Although the follow-up period is limited, the results to date demonstrate that the insertion of an expandable prostatic stent is a safe and reliable method of treating acute urinary retention in patients unfit for surgery. Further follow-up is required to assess long-term safety and to exclude late complications.\r"

  ".W": "The predictive value of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) and of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) for response to treatment (NPCP criteria) was retrospectively assessed in patients with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Fifty-one patients had SAP measured at the start of treatment and at 1 and 2 months. In 31 of these, corresponding PAP levels were also available at each time point. SAP/PAP profiles at 2 months were classified as \"increased\" (increment 15% or greater), \"decreased\" (reduction greater than 15%) or \"stable\", compared with baseline levels. An additional category, SAP \"flare\", was also identified (SAP increment greater than 15% at 1 month, with subsequent fall at 2 months). There was a strong association between the SAP profile at 2 months and the response category, whereas the PAP profile at 2 months was more weakly associated. Using results from the 31 patients with both SAP and PAP profiles, the level of SAP was significantly better in predicting the category of response (SAP: sensitivity 94%, specificity 79%; PAP: sensitivity 53%, specificity 57%). An SAP \"flare\" was associated with response in 8 of 12 patients. An increase in SAP at 1 month is therefore a poor guide to progressive disease and should not be used in isolation to discontinue treatment early. The SAP profile is of value as an earlier predictor of response than X-rays or bone scans and is more reliable than the PAP profile in monitoring patients with prostate cancer and bone metastases.\r"

Recent studies suggest that seven of them will die from postoperative complications and 49 patients will be discharged from the hospital after an average of 3 weeks. Of these patients, 27 will survive the first, 12 the second, and ten the fifth year. Although it may be possible to further reduce postoperative complications and mortality, the chances of improving the long-term prognosis of patients with oesophageal carcinoma seem small.\r"

Intraperitoneal primary closure was otherwise used. Patients received prograde colonic lavage by random allocation. The healing exteriorized colon was interiorized 5-10 days after the initial surgery. The median age was 29 years and only 28 patients were women. Injuries were due to stab (316), gunshot (54), shotgun (10) or blunt trauma (9). Exteriorization of the primarily sutured colon was carried out in 217 patients of whom 101 had prograde colonic lavage. Twenty (9 per cent) died. Of the survivors, 150 (76 per cent) had their colon successfully interiorized and this rate was unaffected by prograde colonic lavage. Intraperitoneal primary closure was performed in 172 patients of whom 91 had prograde colonic lavage. Seven (4 per cent) died. Mortality was directly related to the number of associated injuries. Prograde colonic lavage, irrespective of the type of colonic wound management used, did not reduce the mortality rate, which was 7.2 per cent for those who had such lavage and 6.6 per cent for the rest. Prograde colonic lavage cannot therefore be recommended in colon trauma.\r"

Lymph node involvement was accurately identified in about 80 per cent of cases. Six carcinomas, which had developed within 31 examined tubulovillous adenomas, were detected by endorectal ultrasonography. No carcinoma remained undetected. Endorectal ultrasonography is a highly accurate tool for the staging of rectal carcinoma before operation and for the detection of lymph node involvement.

The role of neutralizing the adrenal androgens is controversial. Combined androgen blockade refers to treatment modalities that lower circulating serum testosterone such as bilateral orchiectomy or an LH-RH agonist and combining it with an antiandrogen. The issue at hand is to review current clinical trials addressing the concept of combined androgen blockade and to determine the feasibility of a meta-analysis.\r"

All 203 patients enrolled in this study underwent bilateral orchiectomy and were randomized to receive either the nonsteroidal anti-androgen nilutamide or a placebo. Patient responses were graded according to the criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project (NPCP). Patients treated with nilutamide had a significantly greater number of positive objective responses (partial and complete regression) than did the patients treated with castration alone (46% versus 20%, P = 0.001). Progression-free survival was improved initially in the nilutamide group, but the median time to progression was 12 months for both groups. Despite an increase in the median length of survival from 18.9 to 24.3 months with the nilutamide, the survival time was not significantly longer in the nilutamide group (log = rank test, P = 0.048). Although minor side effects were frequent, adverse effects related to the medication and leading to discontinuation of treatment were observed in 9% of cases. These results suggest some benefit of the combined treatment (orchiectomy + nilutamide) over orchiectomy alone in the treatment of metastatic prostatic carcinoma.\r"

  ".U": "90367268\r", 
  ".W": "Among the numerous mechanisms proposed for myocardial stunning, three appear to be more plausible: 1) generation of oxygen radicals, 2) calcium overload, and 3) excitation-contraction uncoupling. First, the evidence for a pathogenetic role of oxygen-derived free radicals in myocardial stunning is overwhelming. In the setting of a single 15-minute coronary occlusion, mitigation of stunning by antioxidants has been reproducibly observed by several independent laboratories. Similar protection has been recently demonstrated in the conscious animal, that is, in the most physiological experimental preparation available. Furthermore, generation of free radicals in the stunned myocardium has been directly demonstrated by spin trapping techniques, and attenuation of free radical generation has been repeatedly shown to result in attenuation of contractile dysfunction. Numerous observations suggest that oxyradicals also contribute to stunning in other settings: after global ischemia in vitro, after global ischemia during cardioplegic arrest in vivo, and after multiple brief episodes of regional ischemia in vivo. Compelling evidence indicates that the critical free radical damage occurs in the initial moments of reflow, so that myocardial stunning can be viewed as a sublethal form of oxyradical-mediated \"reperfusion injury.\" Second, there is also considerable evidence that a transient calcium overload during early reperfusion contributes to postischemic dysfunction in vitro; however, the importance of this mechanism in vivo remains to be defined. Third, inadequate release of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, with consequent excitation-contraction uncoupling, may occur after multiple brief episodes of regional ischemia, but its role in other forms of postischemic dysfunction has not been explored. It is probable that multiple mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial stunning. The three hypotheses outlined above are not mutually exclusive and in fact may represent different steps of the same pathophysiological cascade. Thus, generation of oxyradicals may cause sarcoplasmic reticulum dysfunction, and both of these processes may lead to calcium overload, which in turn could exacerbate the damage initiated by oxygen species. The concepts discussed in this review should provide not only a conceptual framework for further investigation of the pathophysiology of reversible ischemia-reperfusion injury but also a rationale for developing clinically applicable interventions designed to prevent postischemic ventricular dysfunction.\r"

  ".W": "Thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has produced the need for an accurate early diagnostic marker. We previously developed and assessed an assay for the creatine kinase (CK)-MB subforms; assay time is 25 minutes. Plasma MB2 (tissue subform) activity, MB1 (plasma-modified subform) activity, and MB2/MB1 ratio in 56 healthy individuals were 0.61 +/- 0.33 units/l, 0.63 +/- 0.33 units/l, and 0.94 +/- 0.39, respectively. Only one individual had both an MB2 activity greater than 1.0 units/l and an MB2/MB1 ratio of more than 1.5. Similar results were obtained in 50 hospitalized patients without cardiac disease; two of these patients had both an MB2 activity and an MB2/MB1 ratio greater than the cutoff values. Among 49 patients with AMI, MB2 activity and the MB2/MB1 ratio began to increase 2 hours after AMI; the ratio reached a plateau of 3.1 by 4-6 hours. The first available plasma sample was abnormal by the subform assay in 67% of patients and by a conventional MB assay in 27% of patients. Assay sensitivities in samples collected at 2-4, 4-6, and 6-8 hours after AMI were 59%, 92%, and 100% for the subform assay and 23%, 50%, and 71% for the conventional assay (p less than 0.03 versus subform assay at each time interval). False-negative results were obtained by the subform and conventional assays in 15 and 45 samples at a mean of 2.3 and 5.8 hours, respectively. Subform assay provides rapid and reliable diagnosis of AMI within 4-6 hours after the onset of symptoms, which is 6 hours before conventional CK-MB assays are accurate.\r"

  ".W": "To analyze the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in preventing early aortocoronary vein graft occlusion, 1,112 consecutive patients were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing 50 mg t.i.d. aspirin, 50 mg aspirin plus 75 mg t.i.d. dipyridamole, and placebo. All patients received 100 mg q.i.d. dipyridamole for 48 hours before surgery, and assigned treatment was started 7 hours after surgery. Vein graft angiography was performed in 927 patients (83%) within 28 days of surgery (mean, 10 days). Aspirin plus dipyridamole significantly (p = 0.017) reduced the occlusion rate of distal anastomoses from 18% (placebo) to 12.9%. Occlusion rate in the aspirin group was 14%, which approached statistical significance (p = 0.058). Furthermore, only aspirin plus dipyridamole reduced (p = 0.01) the number of patients with occluded grafts (placebo, 33%; aspirin, 27.1%; aspirin plus dipyridamole, 24.3%). Mediastinal drainage was slightly higher (p = 0.04) in the aspirin plus dipyridamole group (713 +/- 456 ml) than in the other two groups (placebo, 670 +/- 437 ml; aspirin, 629 +/- 337 ml), but hospital mortality (average, 4.6%) and early reoperation (average, 3.9%) rates were similar among the three groups. Thus, low-dose aspirin plus dipyridamole safely improves early saphenous vein aortocoronary graft patency; this effect is an added benefit to a preoperative regimen of dipyridamole.\r"

  ".W": "Increased platelet aggregation in the morning and upon assuming an upright posture may account at least in part for the observed circadian variation in onset of acute myocardial infarction. The Physicians' Health Study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of alternate-day aspirin intake (325 mg) among 22,071 US male physicians, afforded the opportunity to assess this circadian pattern and examine whether it is altered by aspirin therapy. During a 5-year period of follow-up, 342 cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction were confirmed, of which the time of onset was available in 211 (62%). The placebo group showed a bimodal circadian variation in onset of myocardial infarction with a primary peak between 4:00 AM and 10:00 AM (p less than 0.001). In the aspirin group, however, this circadian variation was minimal (p = 0.16), due primarily to a marked reduction in the morning peak of infarction. Specifically, aspirin was associated with a 59.3% reduction in the incidence of infarction during the morning waking hours, compared with a 34.1% reduction for the remaining hours of the day. The greater reduction was observed during the 3-hour interval immediately after awakening, a period with a risk of infarction twice that of any other comparable time interval (p less than 0.001). Aspirin intake was associated with a mean reduction in the incidence of infarction of 44.8% over the entire 24-hour cycle. These data support the hypothesis that increased platelet aggregability in the morning and upon arising contributes to the occurrence of myocardial infarction and that aspirin reduces the risk of infarction by inhibiting platelet aggregation during these critical periods.\r"

  ".W": "An experimental in vivo model of aortic aneurysm was established by perfusing an isolated segment of rat abdominal aorta with pancreatic elastase. Ten rats were used in each protocol. Saline-perfused aortas developed no aneurysmal dilations. Elastase-perfused aortas contained aneurysms in the perfused area and a total loss of elastic tissue. Control aortas contained no elastic tissue lesions. There was a quantitative relation between the amount of elastase perfused and aneurysm formation: 1-2 units induced neither macroscopic nor microscopic lesions; 3-6 units induced microscopic elastic tissue damage without macroscopic aneurysm; and more than 6 units produced aneurysmal dilation in all cases. In situ elastase secretion by macrophages was induced by perfusing rat aortas with thioglycollate-activated macrophages or with thioglycollate alone. There was aortitis without true aneurysm and a total loss of elastic tissue in the vicinity of activated macrophages within the aortic media. Perfusion of infra-aneurysmal amount of elastase (1 or 2 units) or thioglycollate plus plasmin (2 units) always induced a large aneurysm, whereas plasmin alone induced neither macroscopic nor microscopic lesions. These morphological results were supported by the significantly elevated elastolytic activity within the aortic wall of animals perfused with thioglycollate plus plasmin 9 days, after perfusion (207.6 +/- 54.8 micrograms elastin-rhodamine lysed/18 hr; control rats, 25.43 +/- 11.13). The results suggest that the presence of elastase within the aortic media leads to aneurysm formation. Activated macrophages within the aortic media may be responsible for elastase secretion and elastic tissue destruction. Plasmin may enhance elastase activity and aggravate the aneurysmal lesion.\r"

This approach has revolutionized the management of acute infarction patients worldwide. Such therapy, however, is associated with increased rates of reinfarction and postinfarction angina that have been attributed to the underlying residual atherosclerotic lesion. The expectation that coronary angioplasty would provide the logical solution to this clinical problem has been considerably lowered by the results of a number of prospective randomized clinical trials. These findings, coupled with the realization that as many as 50% of patients suffering acute infarctions will not safely qualify for the use of thrombolytic agents, present compelling reasons to more accurately investigate the role of primary angioplasty and bypass surgery as a means of effecting reperfusion therapy in the setting of acute infarction.\r"

There is clear evidence that thrombolytic therapy, aspirin, and beta-blockers reduce mortality. Both aspirin and beta-blockers also reduce reinfarction and stroke. Of the thrombolytic agents, comparative trials have established that tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase have similar effects on mortality, morbidity, and left ventricular function. There appears to be an increased risk of cerebral hemorrhage with tissue plasminogen activator. The benefits of heparin in conjunction with aspirin and a thrombolytic agent are unclear and, at best, are likely to be modest. Heparin increases the risk of hemorrhagic complications twofold. Although trials of vasodilators conducted before the widespread use of thrombolytic therapy and aspirin have been promising, newer trials are needed to evaluate their effects among patients receiving these agents. The aggregate of all trials of the routine use of calcium antagonists or antiarrhythmic agents indicates that these agents do not improve survival.\r"

  ".U": "90367301\r", 
  ".W": "During myocardial ischemia, malignant arrhythmias and acceleration of cell damage may be induced by sympathetic overstimulation of the heart. This stimulation is due to excessive concentrations of catecholamines within the underperfused myocardium, in combination with enhanced myocyte sensitivity to adrenergic stimuli. Various mechanisms may account for local accumulation of catecholamines in the extracellular space of the ischemic but still viable myocardium. In early myocardial infarction, plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline concentrations are enhanced, reflecting increased activity of the whole sympathetic nervous system, rather than local activity in the heart. In uncomplicated infarction, these concentrations are only five times the normal levels at rest, and there are no convincing data that these mildly increased levels of plasma catecholamines directly induce a major deterioration of myocardial function during the ischemic process. Of more importance is the reflex increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity that is induced by pain, anxiety, and a fall in cardiac output or arterial blood pressure and that is accompanied by local exocytotic release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve endings of the heart. Excessive accumulation of the neurotransmitter, however, is prevented by at least three mechanisms: 1) Released noradrenaline is rapidly removed so long as neuronal catecholamine reuptake is functional. 2) Adenosine accumulating in the ischemic myocardium effectively suppresses exocytotic noradrenaline release by stimulating presynaptic A1-adenosine receptors. 3) Exocytotic catecholamine release ceases when the sympathetic neurons become depleted of adenosine triphosphate since this release mechanism requires high-energy phosphates. However, with progression of ischemia (i.e., greater than 10 minutes), the myocardium is no longer protected against excess adrenergic stimulation since local metabolic release mechanisms become increasingly important. This release, which is independent of both central sympathetic activation and extracellular calcium, occurs in two steps. First, catecholamines escape from their storage vesicles and accumulate in the cytoplasm of the neuron. In the second, rate-limiting step, noradrenaline is transported across the axolemma from the cytoplasm to the interstitial space via the neuronal uptake carrier in reverse of its normal transport direction. As a consequence of this nonexocytotic local metabolic release, extracellular noradrenaline reaches 100-1,000 times its normal plasma concentrations within 30 minutes of ischemia. Concentrations of this magnitude are capable of producing myocardial necrosis, even in the nonischemic heart, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ventricular fibrillation in early ischemia.\r"

In patients with angina pectoris, this condition has been recognized during either exercise stress testing or ambulatory monitoring when ischemic-type ST-segment shifts occur without symptoms. Although more information is clearly needed, available data suggest an important independent relation between ambulant ischemia, most of which is silent, and adverse outcome. Other studies show that currently available antianginal agents can prevent or modify symptomatic as well as silent ischemic episodes. Several reports indicate that when these agents are prescribed to control symptomatic ischemic episodes, silent ischemia may continue to occur. Yet, when antianginal drugs are used either alone or in combination in those with recurrent silent ischemia, both the frequency and duration of the silent ischemic episodes are greatly reduced. To date, however, no data are yet available on the impact on outcome of a strategy directed at detecting and treating silent ischemia. Until this information is available, more attention should be focused on identifying and adequately controlling ischemia rather than on simply managing chest pain.\r"

  ".W": "In the United States, there may be as many as two million totally asymptomatic men with silent myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery disease. Because detection of such patients is often fortuitous, a rigorous screening protocol has been suggested for high-risk subgroups (i.e., persons with multiple coronary risk factors and/or family histories of premature coronary artery disease). At present, the initial procedure of choice for a screening protocol is the exercise test, followed by radionuclide procedures to differentiate true-positive from false-positive responses if coronary angiography is being considered. Holter monitoring is useful in documenting out-of-hospital ischemic events in asymptomatic patients with documented coronary artery disease. Prognostic studies in patients with and without coronary angiographic data indicate that asymptomatic patients with an ischemic ST-segment depression on exercise tests comprise a high-risk subgroup that has a well-defined morbidity and mortality due to future cardiac events. The angiographic surveys show that the greatest risk is in those individuals with more extensive disease. Treatment in asymptomatic persons requires the use of objective measurements as end points. Several reports have demonstrated the efficacy of beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and coronary angioplasty in this population, at least so far as reducing total ischemic activity is concerned. How nonsurgical therapy will affect ultimate prognosis is still unclear. However, surgical therapy in asymptomatic patients with left main coronary artery disease and triple-vessel disease has been reported to improve long-term survival.\r"

Preliminary reports suggest that ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring provides additional information not contained in the exercise test, but it is still unclear whether silent ischemia is a marker of subsequent events or is responsible for their development. Recent investigations also suggest that intermittent episodes of ischemia may cause myocardial necrosis. Drugs that are effective in the treatment of angina are also effective in the treatment of silent ischemia, but their value in terms of long-term morbidity and mortality is unclear. Recently, the circadian distribution of silent ischemia has been reported in 150 patients off therapy, in 33 receiving nifedipine, and in 41 receiving atenolol. Most ischemic episodes off therapy occurred between 7:30 AM and 7:30 PM with a peak in the morning and a lesser peak in the evening. Nifedipine did not alter the circadian pattern of ischemic episodes; atenolol abolished the morning peak, the peak incidence of ischemia then occurring in the evening. This circadian distribution of ischemic episodes and the observed changes with treatment resemble the reported circadian variations of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death. Large multicenter studies are now being performed to determine the effects of treatment on silent ischemia and how this treatment may influence outcome. Until such studies have been completed, it is not possible to clearly define the indication for drug therapy in the management of silent ischemia.\r"

This increase occurs rapidly after onset of global ischemia (15 minutes) and persists even after prolonged periods of global ischemia. This alteration can be observed both in vivo and in vitro in isolated perfused hearts. Several groups have previously shown that ischemia induces a local release of endogenous catecholamines. Here, we show that these endogenous catecholamines are sufficiently high to induce receptor desensitization with internalization of beta-adrenergic receptors in normal hearts. In acute myocardial ischemia, however, agonist-promoted internalization and functional uncoupling of beta-adrenergic receptors is abolished. Consequently, the balance of internalization and externalization of receptors is shifted toward an increase in functionally coupled receptors at the cell surface. Similarly, but inconsistently, the density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in the plasma membrane is increased in acute myocardial ischemia. In regard to function, the increase of coupled beta-adrenergic receptors leads to an augmented responsiveness of the adenylyl cyclase system to beta-adrenergic stimulation. This receptor-specific sensitization is superimposed by a transient increase of total adenylyl cyclase activity in the very early phase of global ischemia (0-20 minutes). The enhanced activity of adenylyl cyclase to direct stimulation is tightly associated with the partially purified enzyme, suggesting a covalent modification of the enzyme molecule. However, after prolonged periods (greater than 30 minutes) of global ischemia, the ischemia-induced enzyme-specific sensitization is displaced by a general reduction in enzyme activity, both in vivo and in vitro. The persistent sensitization at the receptor level then meets an unresponsive adenylyl cyclase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The administration of beta-adrenergic blockers before or within the first few minutes after coronary artery occlusion prevents or attenuates the development of ventricular fibrillation. beta-Receptor numbers are increased in the ischemic myocardium at 60 minutes of coronary artery occlusion but are uncoupled from the adenylate cyclase enzyme at the level of the G protein and/or catalytic unit. However, with reperfusion after 60 minutes of coronary artery occlusion, the increase in ischemic-region beta-adrenergic receptor numbers persists, and adenylate cyclase responsiveness to beta-receptor stimulation is restored. If a catecholamine is administered, increases in cyclic AMP and activated phosphorylase occur in ischemic-reperfused myocardium. These data indicate that beta-adrenergic mechanisms may play an important role in arrhythmogenesis and may contribute to myocyte injury during severe and intense myocardial ischemia and evolving myocardial infarction.\r"

Plaques may also either be solid and fibrous or may contain, in addition to fibrous thickening, a pool of extracellular cholesterol. Most subjects with ischemic heart disease have mixtures of all plaque types. The endothelium over established human plaques often shows focal denudation injury, with adhesion of a platelet monolayer not detectable by angiography. Larger thrombi are due either to superficial intimal injury, which is the progression of the endothelial denudation seen over otherwise static and intact plaques, or to deep intimal injury caused by plaque fissuring (rupture). Both forms of intimal injury expose collagen and von Willebrand factor to platelets. In deep injury, tears extend from the lumen into the depths of the intima and often enter a lipid pool; in consequence, thrombus initially forms within the plaque, thereby altering its configuration and expanding its volume. Many fissures will reseal at this stage, but the plaque is larger, and the process is an important cause of episodic sudden plaque growth. A proportion of plaque fissures are associated with the additional formation of a luminal thrombus, which may be either mural or occlusive. In life, transitions between mural and occlusive thrombi and vice versa occur rapidly and frequently. Mural thrombus is associated with distal embolization of platelet masses and, in some cases, is associated with cholesterol from the plaque.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque associated with partial or complete thrombotic vessel occlusion is fundamental to the development of ischemic coronary syndromes. Plaques that produce only mild-to-moderate angiographic luminal stenosis are frequently those that undergo abrupt disruption, leading to unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction. Plaques with increased lipid content appear more prone to rupture, particularly when the lipid pool is localized eccentrically within the intima. Macrophages appear to play an important role in atherogenesis, perhaps by participating in the uptake and metabolism of lipoproteins, secretion of growth factors, and production of enzymes and toxic metabolites that may facilitate plaque rupture. In addition, the particular composition or configuration of a plaque and the hemodynamic forces to which it is exposed may determine its susceptibility to disruption. Exposure of collagen, lipids, and smooth muscle cells after plaque rupture leads to the activation of platelets and the coagulation cascade system. The resulting thrombus may lead to marked reduction in myocardial perfusion and the development of an unstable coronary syndrome, or it may become organized and incorporated into the diseased vessel, thus contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis. In unstable angina, plaque disruption leads to thrombosis, which is usually labile and results in only a transient reduction in myocardial perfusion. Release of vasoactive substances, arterial spasm, or increases in myocardial oxygen demand may contribute to ischemia. In acute myocardial infarction, plaque disruption results in a more persistent thrombotic vessel occlusion; the extent of necrosis depends on the size of the artery, the duration of occlusion, the presence of collateral flow, and the integrity of the fibrinolytic system. Thrombi that undergo lysis expose a highly thrombogenic surface to the circulating blood, which has the capacity of activating platelets and the coagulation cascade system and may lead to thrombotic reocclusion. Measurements aimed at reversing the process of atherosclerosis via cholesterol reduction and enhanced high density lipoprotein activity are encouraging. Active research is being focused on the development of new antithrombotic tools, such as inhibitors of thrombin, thromboxane, and serotonin receptor antagonists, and monoclonal antibodies aimed at blocking platelet membrane receptors or adhesive proteins. These compounds may prove useful when immediate and potent inhibition of the hemostatic system is desired. Intensive research is still needed in the areas of pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "High plasma cholesterol concentration is an important coronary heart disease risk factor, particularly in subjects less than 50 years old. Cholesterol is transported mainly by low (LDLs) and high (HDLs) density lipoproteins. High plasma levels of HDL and its apolipoprotein (A-I) are associated with low coronary heart disease risk, and the reverse is true for LDL and its apolipoprotein (B). Plasma levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) are probably not an independent risk factor, and the situation for plasma triglycerides is unclear. beta-Blockers have no significant effects on plasma concentrations of either total or LDL cholesterol, but HDL plasma concentration is reduced by about 10%, particularly by nonselective beta-blockers. Plasma triglyceride and VLDL concentrations are both raised by beta-blockade. Despite these plasma lipid changes, beta-blockers, by decreasing myocardial oxygen requirements, exhibit marked anti-ischemic properties. beta-Blockers without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity effect a 30% decrease in death from myocardial infarction (MI) in the years after an acute MI. Primary prevention of MI by beta-blockade in hypertensive persons has been well debated and probably exists (although to a lesser extent than secondary prevention) in men, particularly for nonsmokers (for nonselective beta-blockers), and despite any plasma lipid changes. beta-Blockade can inhibit the preatheromatous and atheromatous changes induced by catecholamines in the coronary arteries of animals. beta-blockers may also reduce or slow the following processes: 1) endothelial permeability to lipoproteins; 2) acylcholesterol acyltransferase activity within the arterial wall, thereby preventing cholesterol esterification and deposition in foam cells; 3) LDL precipitation with arterial wall proteoglycans; 4) calcium influx into atheromatous areas; 5) preatheromatous increased endothelial turnover; 6) heart rate; 7) blood velocity and flow disturbances; 8) atheromatous plaque rupture and consequent coronary thrombosis; and 9) platelet activity. Thus, beta-blockers may inhibit atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the likelihood of plaque beta-blockers may inhibit atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the likelihood of plaque rupture, clot formation, and coronary thrombosis.\r"

Early- versus late-entry trials must be distinguished, and the possibility of a modification of effect caused by the nature of drug therapy already given when the patient became unstable or by concomitant treatment in addition to experimental treatment must be taken into account. These factors cannot be overlooked when the results from a limited number of reported trials are pooled together. The largest early-entry trial with a beta-blocker and a calcium antagonist was the Holland Interuniversity Nifedipine/metoprolol Trial (HINT), which enrolled patients with suspected unstable angina diagnosed at coronary care unit admission. HINT results showed that unstable angina cannot be reliably differentiated from evolving myocardial infarction (MI) in this particular context and that there are few early MIs that could have been prevented. In patients who were not already taking a beta-blocker, metoprolol reduced the incidence of acute MI or recurrent ischemia, and there was no benefit of nifedipine. On the other hand, the addition of nifedipine was effective in patients whose conditions became unstable despite maintenance treatment with a beta-blocker. Thus, previous beta-blockade modified the effect of the calcium antagonist studied. Based on evidence from HINT and other trials, it is concluded that beta-blockers should be used as the first-line treatment in patients with unstable angina and that a calcium antagonist should be added when patients remain unstable despite beta-blockade.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

UAP patients were more likely than SAP patients to be smokers and to have had prior myocardial infarctions.

In order to obtain further information about the effect of PMMA fragments on the surrounding tissue and the role of such particles in the development of bone resorption, the authors investigated 17 patients with cemented total hip endoprostheses showing osteolysis and implant loosening in the femoral shaft with (Group B) and without (Group A) involvement of the acetabulum. The roentgenographic follow-up examinations revealed an initially slow and later more rapid extension of the endosteal bone erosions, with a predilection for the tip of the stem, the lesser trochanter, and laterally for the middle of the stem. At revision surgery, tissue samples were taken from the joint capsule and the bone-cement interface, in particular from the osteolysis in the femoral shaft and the acetabulum. The tissue samples were processed for histology, microscopically examined, and semiquantitatively evaluated. The retrieved devices were also carefully inspected. Large foreign-body granulomas were found at the bone-cement interface and in the joint capsule. Histiocytes and foreign-body giant cells stored particles of PMMA and polyethylene, of which fragmented bone cement predominated. Granulomatous tissue invaded bone canals and marrow spaces and induced resorption of the surrounding bone. In four cases in Group A, tissue from the osteolysis contained only fragmented bone cement, demonstrating that PMMA particles alone may be responsible for triggering focal bone resorption. Osteolysis seems to begin at the site where disintegration of bone cement begins. In cases in which polyethylene particles were found in the tissue in addition to fragmented bone cement, wear from the ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene socket has been increased by entrapment of PMMA particles between the joint surfaces. Thus, fragmentation of bone cement and abrasion of polyethylene enhance each other. Bone cement particles promote polyethylene wear, which in turn promotes granuloma formation, bone resorption, and subsequent bone cement disintegration.\r"
