Cerebral glucose metabolism was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and 2-[18-F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). The affected twin had a seven year history of progressive cognitive impairment and was severely demented. Neuropsychological testing of the affected twin demonstrated marked deficits in all areas of cognitive function. The asymptomatic twin showed some impairment on tests of perceptual organisation and delayed recall. The affected twin had loss of gray matter and ventricular enlargement on QCT and MRI compared with healthy controls (p less than 0.05). He also had frontal and parietal lobe hypometabolism and increased asymmetry of metabolism on PET compared to both his twin and healthy age-matched controls (p less than 0.05). PET, QCT, and MRI distinguished changes in the twin with DAT compared with his brother and healthy controls. Although the subtle neuropsychological abnormalities of the asymptomatic twin may be signs of early DAT, they were not accompanied by any changes in regional cerebral metabolism or brain structure.\r"

Perivascular inflammation in the central nervous system was also suppressed in animals receiving effective doses. Although these doses were well tolerated, cytoplasmic lamellar-bodies were found in the central nervous system of all SG-treated animals.

The adoptive transfer of LAK cells was very effective in reducing the clinical symptoms and signs, and in eliminating the malignant cells from the cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, this therapy is an attractive approach for the treatment of malignant tumors that have poor immunogenicity and are insensitive to several anti-cancer agents, and for patients with severe immunosuppressive conditions induced by repeated radiation therapy or chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Pre- and postoperative positron emission tomography (PET) was performed in six patients undergoing extracranial to intracranial bypass procedures for the treatment of symptomatic extracranial carotid occlusion. The six patients were all men, aged 52 to 68 years. Their symptoms included transient ischemic attacks (five cases), amaurosis fugax (two cases), and completed stroke with good recovery (one case). Positron emission tomography was performed within 4 weeks prior to surgery and between 3 to 6 months postoperatively, using oxygen-15-labeled CO, O2, and CO2 and fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose. Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral metabolic rates for oxygen and glucose (CMRO2 and CMRGlu), and the oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured in both hemispheres. Preoperatively, compared to five elderly control subjects, patients had increased CBV, a decreased CBF/CBV ratio, and decreased CMRO2, indicating reduced cerebral perfusion pressure and depressed oxygen metabolism. The CBF was decreased in only one patient who had bilateral carotid occlusions; the OEF, CMRGlu, and CMRO2/CMRGlu and CMRGlu/CBF ratios were not significantly different from control measurements. All bypasses were patent and all patients were asymptomatic following surgery. Postoperative PET revealed decreased CBV and an increased CBF/CBV ratio, indicating improved hemodynamic function and oxygen hypometabolism. This was associated with increased CMRO2 in two patients in whom the postoperative OEF was also increased. The CMRGlu and CMRGlu/CBF ratio were increased in five patients. Changes in CBF and the CMRO2/CMRGlu ratio were variable. One patient with preoperative progressive mental deterioration, documented by serial neuropsychological testing and decreasing CBF and CMRO2, had improved postoperative CBF and CMRO2 concomitant with improved neuropsychological functioning. It is concluded that symptomatic carotid occlusion is associated with altered hemodynamic function and oxygen hypometabolism. Cerebral revascularization results in decreased CBV, indicating improved hemodynamic reserve, but does not consistently improve oxygen metabolism.\r"

Growth indices examined in 21-d fetuses were body weight and ossification of sacrococcygeal vertebrae, supraoccipital bone, sternebrae and proximal phalanges in the forepaw stained by alizarin red S. Growth retardation was expressed in hours by comparison with the normal standard development, or in sigma by calculating the relative difference from the control, utilizing the standard variance in normal fetuses. Degrees of growth retardation expressed in the common scales were different among the indices and between fasting and massive doses of ergocalciferol; body weight and ossification of sacrococcygeal vertebrae were most severely retarded by fasting and least by ergocalciferol. Ossification of sternebrae was moderately retarded by fasting and by ergocalciferol, and ossification of supraoccipital bone was moderately retarded by fasting but not by ergocalciferol. Ossification of proximal phalanges in the forepaw was least retarded by fasting and most severely retarded by ergocalciferol. The observed retardations were progressions relatable to the duration of fasting. Combined treatments of fasting and ergocalciferol showed more deleterious effects on growth than fasting only or ergocalciferol only and induced face anomalies, \"carnival fetuses.\" These findings show that growth retardations induced by different nutritional disturbances may vary among indices and that comparisons of various indices are important in the analysis of teratological experiments.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to compare the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) in response to various muscarinic receptor agonists from canine femoral arteries mounted in organ chambers or perfused in a bioassay system. In rings of femoral arteries, suspended for isometric tension recording in organ chambers, acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxations during contractions evoked by prostaglandin F2 alpha. Atropine and pirenzepine antagonized these relaxations in a competitive manner, atropine with a higher affinity (KB = 1.9 X 10(-9) M) than pirenzepine (KB = 5.4 X 10(-7) M). Carbachol and McN-A-343 also evoked endothelium-dependent relaxations, and pirenzepine inhibited these responses with a similar low potency. The order of relative potency of the agonists in organ chamber studies was acetylcholine = carbachol much greater than McN-A-343. Isolated segments of femoral arteries with endothelium were perfused (2 ml/min) with modified Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate solution containing indomethacin; the perfusate was bioassayed for endothelium-derived relaxing factor(s) by means of a ring of coronary artery without endothelium. When infused above but not below the femoral artery, low concentrations (10(-8)-10(-7) M) of acetylcholine caused transient relaxations of the bioassay ring contracted with prostaglandin F2 alpha; higher concentrations of acetylcholine caused sustained decreases in tension. Atropine inhibited the two phases of the concentration-relaxation curve with similar potencies. Pirenzepine inhibited both phases in a competitive manner but exhibited significantly higher potency against the first- (ED50, 1.9 X 10(-9) M) than against the second-phase responses (ED50, 2.1 X 10(-7) M). Compound McN-A-343 induced only transient decreases in tension, whereas carbachol caused sustained relaxations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "87169259\r", 
  ".W": "The goal of this study was to determine if the opioid system which is stimulatory to prolactin (PRL) secretion develops before the serotonergic system which regulates PRL release. The opioid and serotonergic systems were chosen for comparison because evidence exists that functional serotonergic neurons are necessary for opiate-induced PRL secretion in adult rats. Haloperidol and morphine produced a dose-related stimulation of PRL release in animals of all ages. In contrast, the serotonin agonists, quipazine and m-chlorophenylpiperazine, and the serotonin-releasing drug p-chloroamphetamine produced dose-related increases in PRL release in adult rats, but not in neonatal rats. The PRL response to the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan was potentiated by fluoxetine only in animals 15 days of age or older. PRL secretion induced by these serotonergic agents was blocked by cyproheptadine, a serotonin receptor antagonist. Unlike PRL, corticosterone and growth hormone secretion were stimulated by quipazine and 5-hydroxytryptophan plus fluoxetine in both adult and neonatal rats. These findings suggest that stimulatory opioid control of PRL secretion and the dopaminergic mechanism which tonically inhibits PRL release are intact in the neonatal rat. In contrast, the stimulatory serotonergic mechanism is not functional until between 10 to 15 days of age. This late maturation appears to be specific to the serotonergic neurons regulating PRL release because the corticosterone and growth hormone responses to serotonergic stimulation develop early in ontogeny.\r"

LCT were cytotoxic to both peripheral blood B and T cells as well as to OKT4 and OKT8 subpopulations. The interaction with the B cells was more pronounced than with the T cells as shown by reactivity with the former at higher serum dilutions than with the latter. Similar results were obtained with eluates from the unseparated lymphocytes and from B or from T cells. Partial purification of LCT demonstrated that they belong to the IgM class. LCT correlated with the level of circulating immune complexes as determined by the fluid phase C1q binding assay, but they did not correlate with the level of immunoglobulins, complement or antinuclear factors. The presence of LCT correlated significantly with the activity but not with the disease duration or the number of involved organs. Correlation of LCT with the activity of vasculitis implies that these cytotoxins may have a pathogenetic role and perhaps may serve as a marker for disease activity.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes derived from patients with renal cell carcinoma were stimulated with interleukin 2 and tested in a 4-hour 51chromium-release cytotoxicity assay against autologous cultured tumor and myeloid K562 cells. Of 23 patients autologous tumor lysis of more than 0 per cent was observed in 20 (range 5.3 to 82.8 per cent) and more than 10 per cent lysis was noted in 16. Since no significant correlation between the degree of cytotoxicity and the pathological findings of tumor stage, grade, cell type or lymphocyte infiltration in the tumor was found, it was impossible to predict from the pathological findings which tumor could be lysed by peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with interleukin 2. Comparison of natural killer cell activity against K562 of freshly prepared peripheral blood lymphocytes to that of interleukin 2-treated lymphocytes revealed significant augmentation from 23.6 +/- 9.7 to 65.2 +/- 29.1 per cent. From the kinetics study the lysis of autologous tumor cells was detectable on day 2 of interleukin 2 exposure and the peak activity was observed on day 5. A similar trend was noted in regard to K562 cell lysis. Measurements of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets with monoclonal antibodies and argon ion laser flow cytometry resulted in a significant decrease of cells positive for OKT 4 (helper/inducer) and a significant increase of cells positive for OKT 8 (suppressor/cytotoxic) and Leu 7 (natural killer) by interleukin 2 treatment. A cold target cell inhibition test was performed in 2 patients with unlabeled autologous tumor and K562 cells as cold inhibitors. In 1 patient unlabeled K562 completely inhibited the tumor lysis but in 1 complete inhibition by autologous tumor and incomplete blockade by K562 were found. From this observation we concluded that peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with interleukin 2 lysed not only autologous tumor cells but also K562. Our results demonstrate that adoptive immunotherapy with peripheral blood lymphocytes activated by interleukin 2 in patients with renal cell carcinoma could be appropriate as a therapeutic procedure.\r"

The glue was mixed with barium and placed in the duodenal sinus under endoscopic guidance. The barium-impregnated glue facilitated follow-up surveillance with abdominal roentgenography. The patient had no further gastrointestinal bleeding. Further clinical and experimental studies should be conducted to determine the mechanism of action and the efficacy of this application of fibrin glue.\r"

A pathogen was identified in 129 (55%) episodes, with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and influenza viruses those most frequently identified.

Five relapses (in 5 patients) occurred (1 optic nerve glioma, 2 medulloblastomas, and 2 ependymomas), three during and two after completion of GH treatment. Patients with medulloblastoma and ependymoma who relapsed were older at tumour diagnosis, underweight at the start of GH therapy, and entered puberty later than similar relapse-free patients. The late relapse rate of medulloblastoma and glioma was unaltered by GH therapy. Ependymoma carries a poor prognosis, and of the 4 late survivors, the 2 who received GH relapsed. No leukaemic relapse has been associated with GH treatment. The findings indicate that GH therapy does not increase the relapse rate of medulloblastoma, glioma, and leukaemia.\r"

We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and biochemical efficacy of intermittent infusions of alpha 1-antitrypsin in the treatment of patients with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Twenty-one patients were given 60 mg of active plasma-derived alpha 1-antitrypsin per kilogram of body weight, once a week for up to six months. After a steady state had been reached, the group had trough serum levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin of 126 +/- 1 mg per deciliter as compared with 30 +/- 1 mg per deciliter before treatment, and serum anti-neutrophil elastase capacities of 13.3 +/- 0.1 microM as compared with 5.4 +/- 0.1 microM. The alpha 1-antitrypsin level in the epithelial-lining fluid of the lungs was 0.46 +/- 0.16 microM before treatment, and the anti-neutrophil elastase capacity was 0.81 +/- 0.13 microM. Six days after infusion, alpha 1-antitrypsin levels (1.89 +/- 0.17 microM) and anti-neutrophil elastase capacities (1.65 +/- 0.13 microM) in the lining fluid were significantly increased (P less than 0.0001). Because of the chronicity of the disorder and the lack of sensitive measures of lung destruction, the clinical efficacy of this therapy could not be studied rigorously. No changes in lung function were observed in our patients over six months of treatment. The only important adverse reactions to the 507 infusions were four episodes of self-limited fever. This study demonstrates that infusions of alpha 1-antitrypsin derived from plasma are safe and can reverse the biochemical abnormalities in serum and lung fluid that characterize this disorder. Together with lifetime avoidance of cigarette smoking, replacement therapy with alpha 1-antitrypsin may be a logical approach to long-term medical treatment.\r"

They also proliferate in association with marrow-derived stromal cells although biologically active amounts of HCGFs cannot be detected in stromal culture supernatants. It is possible that HCGFs are synthesized in small amounts by stromal cells but remain bound to the stromal cells and/or their extracellular matrix (ECM). This interpretation accords with haematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in close association with stromal layers in long-term cultures. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are found in the ECM produced by stromal cells. They are prime candidates for selectively retaining HCGFs in the stromal layer; they influence embryonic morphogenesis and cyto-differentiation and they may regulate haematopoiesis. We now report that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity can be eluted from cultured stromal layers and that exogenous GM-CSF binds to GAGs from bone marrow stromal ECM. Selective compartmentalization of HCGFs in this manner may be an important function of the marrow microenvironment and may be involved in haematopoietic cell regulation.\r"

The elements in the HIV genome which control activation are not known but expression might be regulated through a variety of DNA elements. The cis-acting control elements of the viral genome are enhancer and promoter regions. The virus also encodes trans-acting factors specified by the tat-III and art genes. We have examined whether products specific to activated T cells might stimulate viral transcription by binding to regions on viral DNA. Activation of T cells, which increases HIV expression up to 50-fold, correlated with induction of a DNA binding protein indistinguishable from a recognized transcription factor, called NF-kappa B, with binding sites in the viral enhancer. Mutation of these binding sites abolished inducibility. That NF-kappa B acts in synergy with the viral tat-III gene product to enhance HIV expression in T cells may have implications for the pathogenesis of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome).\r"

  ".W": "The mitogenic or antigenic stimulation of T lymphocytes in the presence of accessory cells results in the synthesis of interleukin-2 (IL-2), which, on interacting with de novo synthesized receptors on the membrane, induces the proliferation and differentiation of T cells. T lymphocytes are the preferential target cells of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I). This virus was isolated from leukaemic cells of patients with adult T-cell leukaemia. No viral transcription was detected in these leukaemic cells, indicating that consistent expression of HTLV-I is not needed for maintenance of the neoplastic state. After a short time in culture, these leukaemic cells produce viral particles which immortalize normal T cells. Hence, HTLV-I might be an important agent not only in the development, but also in the initiation, of this lymphoproliferative disease. This possibility was sustained by our previous observations indicating that normal T lymphocytes incubated with HTLV-I are able to form colonies in soft agar, seven days later, in the absence of exogenous IL-2. These results led us to explore further the immediate effects of viral infection on purified resting T lymphocytes. Here, we present evidence that HTLV-I is able to activate T lymphocytes. Indeed, binding of viral particles to these cells induces IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression, and triggers T-cell proliferation. This initial activation, which appears to be independent of accessory cells, may be relevant in understanding the role of HTLV-I in the aetiology of adult T-cell leukaemia.\r"

This recombinant interleukin 2 was chemically modified by an active ester of polyethylene glycol. The modified interleukin 2 was purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography and characterized by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing. This conjugate was compared to unmodified recombinant interleukin 2 in vitro and in vivo. Covalent attachment of the hydrophilic polymer polyethylene glycol enhanced the solubility of interleukin 2, decreased its plasma clearance, and increased its antitumor potency in the Meth A murine sarcoma model.\r"

In brain, the expression of the injected gene was identical to that of the endogenous gene in a tissue- and development-specific manner. In lymphoid tissue, the transferred gene was also expressed correctly in the early phases of T-cell lineage development; however, as the T cells matured, the transcription of the transferred gene, but not the endogenous gene, was suppressed. This result shows that different regulatory elements are used to express the Thy-1 gene in early and late lymphoid development.\r"

  ".U": "87175521\r", 
  ".W": "Senescence in cultured adrenocortical cells involves changes in expression of differentiated functions as well as changes in responses to mitogenic stimulation. Steroid 17 alpha-hydroxylase (steroid 17 alpha-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.99.9) is an adrenal-specific enzyme, the expression of which is dependent on the presence of stimulators of cyclic AMP production, such as cholera toxin. Dot-blot hybridization of RNA from bovine adrenocortical cells that had been incubated with cholera toxin showed a marked decline in 17 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels as a function of population doubling level, closely paralleling the decline in induction of 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme activity. The lower levels of 17 alpha-hydroxylase induction did not result from a requirement for a longer time period for induction or from a specific defect in response to cholera toxin and were not caused by a general failure of enzyme induction in response to cyclic AMP. The decreased growth rate in older cells results from a general decline in response to several growth factors. However, the decline in 17 alpha-hydroxylase induction did not result from a loss of response of the cells to mitogens, since quiescent cells at a low population doubling level showed stimulation of 17 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA by cholera toxin to levels similar to those in nonquiescent cultures and added mitogens either had no effect on 17 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA levels or decreased them. There was, however, a specific posttranscriptional effect of insulin on 17 alpha-hydroxylase. The loss of 17 alpha-hydroxylase induction is unlikely to result from overgrowth of a minority cell type lacking the ability to induce 17 alpha-hydroxylase, because adrenocortical cell clones that had high levels of 17 alpha-hydroxylase induction gave rise to cells with lower levels of induction on subcloning. Thus, loss of 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity in adrenocortical cellular senescence results from a primary failure of accumulation of 17 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA after incubation with the inducing agent.\r"

  ".W": "The helper T-cell response to globular proteins appears, in general, to require intracellular processing of the antigen, such that a peptide fragment containing the T-cell antigenic determinant is released and transported to and held on the surface of an Ia-expressing, antigen-presenting cell. However, the molecular details underlying these phenomena are largely unknown. The means by which antigenic peptides are anchored on the antigen-presenting cell surface was investigated. A cell surface protein is identified that was isolated by its ability to bind to a 24-amino acid peptide fragment of pigeon cytochrome c, residues 81-104, containing the major antigenic determinant for B10.A mouse T cells. This peptide binding protein, purified from [35S]methionine-labeled cells, appears as two discrete bands of approximately equal to 72 and 74 kDa after NaDodSO4/PAGE. The protein can be eluted from the peptide affinity column with equivalent concentrations of either the antigenic pigeon cytochrome c peptide or the corresponding nonantigenic peptide of mouse cytochrome c. However, it does not bind to the native cytochromes c, either of pigeon or mouse, and thus the protein appears to recognize some structure available only in the free peptides. This protein plays a role in antigen presentation as evidenced by the ability of rabbit antibodies raised against it to block the activation of an antigen-specific T-cell hybrid by antigen-presenting cells and pigeon cytochrome c. Its expression is not major histocompatibility complex-restricted in that the blocking activity of the antisera can be absorbed on spleen cells from mice of different haplotypes. This peptide binding protein can be isolated from a variety of cell types, including B cells, T cells, and fibroblasts. The anchoring of processed peptides on the cell surface by such a protein may play a role in antigen presentation--facilitating the interaction of antigenic peptides with Ia and/or the T-cell receptor.\r"

BSF-1 binding was rapid and saturable at 4 degrees C and 37 degrees C with a slow dissociation rate. On all cell types examined, BSF-1 bound to a single class of high-affinity receptor (less than 2000 receptors per cell) with a Ka of 10(10)-10(11) M-1. Receptor expression on resting primary B and T cells was low (less than 100 receptors per cell), whereas activation with lipopolysaccharide or Con A produced a 5- to 10-fold increase in receptor numbers. Among a panel of lymphokines and growth hormones, only unlabeled BSF-1 was able to compete for the binding of 125I-labeled BSF-1.

In cells bearing the plasmid, we detected a low level of material that cross-reacts with antibody to polyoma tumor antigens, suggesting that the plasmids replicate and are maintained in the cells by a mechanism different from that functioning during propagation following infection of papovaviruses.\r"

Studies using washed particulate fractions of the 600 X g supernatant indicate that all-trans-[3H]retinol is isomerized to 11-cis-retinoids much more effectively than is all-trans-[3H]retinal or all-trans-[3H]retinyl palmitate. The 11-cis-retinoid biosynthetic activity is heat-labile, sedimentable by high-speed centrifugation, and largely found in the pigment epithelium rather than in the neural retina.\r"

  ".W": "Human fibronectin (FN) genomic clones were isolated by screening a human genomic library with a 75-base oligonucleotide. The sequence of the oligonucleotide corresponds to a region near the 5' end of the human FN cDNA clone pFH6 that contains the amino-terminal coding sequences but does not extend to the 5' end of the mRNA [Kornblihtt, A. R., Umezawa, K., Vibe-Pedersen, K. & Baralle, F. E. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1755-1759]. The 5' end of the FN gene is found on a 3.7-kilobase-pair EcoRI fragment that contains about 2.7 kilobase pairs of flanking sequence. The first exon is 414 base pairs long, with a 5' untranslated region of 267 base pairs. As deduced on the basis of the position of the initiation codon, FN is synthesized with a 31-residue amino acid extension on the amino terminus that is not present in the mature polypeptide. This amino-terminal extension appears to contain both a signal peptide and a propeptide. The first 200 base pairs of 5'-flanking sequence is very G + C rich. Upstream of this the sequence becomes relatively A + T rich. The sequence ATATAA is found at -25 and the sequence CAAT is present at -150. The sequence GGGGCGGGGC at -102 exhibits homology to the binding site for the transcription factor SP1, and the sequence TGACGTCA at -173 exhibits homology to 5'-flanking sequences important for induction by cAMP.\r"

Viral mutants affected in this function (vhs mutants) have previously been derived. Cells infected with these mutants exhibit a more stable synthesis of host as well as the immediate early (alpha)-viral proteins. We now show that a function associated with purified virions of the wild-type virus reduces the half-life of host and alpha mRNAs, whereas purified vhs-1 mutant virions lack this activity. The functional half-life of many early (beta)- and late (gamma)-viral mRNAs is also prolonged in mutant virus infections. These studies suggest that the wild-type virion brings into cells a function that indiscriminately reduces the half-life of both host and viral transcripts and that the early translational shutoff of the host is a consequence of this function. This function may facilitate rapid transitions in the expression of groups of genes that are transcriptionally turned on at different times after infection.\r"

Both the propolypeptide, which was found to be a homodimer of noncovalently linked subunits, and mature vWf were released from Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells following stimulation with secretagogues. The stoichiometry of the two released proteins was essentially equimolar. This indicates that vWf and the propolypeptide were packaged into the Weibel-Palade bodies as one unit, pro-vWf, and that the proteolytic cleavage of pro-vWf is likely to be a post-Golgi event. The association of prosequences into dimers supports their hypothetical role in the multimerization process. After secretion, the two proteins were distributed differently, as based on the following observations. The propolypeptide did not associate with vWf in the culture medium, did not codistribute with vWf in the extracellular \"patches of release\" on stimulated endothelial cells, and was not detected in the endothelial cell extracellular matrix, which did contain vWf. Additionally, in contrast to vWf, the propolypeptide did not bind to the matrix of human foreskin fibroblasts. Since the propolypeptide does not associate with vWf and does not interact with extracellular matrices in vitro, it is highly unlikely that it would promote platelet adhesion to subendothelium in vivo.\r"

Increases in TGF-beta activity persisted undiminished for 48 hr after removal of these factors. The increases in TGF-beta activity from the resorbing bone cultures were relatively greater than the increases in bone resorption. Calcitonin inhibition of bone resorption correlated with a decrease in TGF-beta activity. Thus, agents that modulate bone resorption also affect TGF-beta activity in the bone culture medium.

It belongs to the same family of carboxyl-terminally amidated peptides as pancreatic polypeptide and peptide YY. We describe here the gene encoding the rat neuropeptide Y precursor. The gene spans 7.2 kilobase pairs and contains four exons. The exon organization is identical to the pancreatic polypeptide gene, although the amino acid sequences of the neuropeptide Y and pancreatic polypeptide precursors differ extensively. The predicted amino acid sequence of mature rat neuropeptide Y is identical to the human sequence. Also the sequence of the 30-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide of preproneuropeptide Y is highly conserved, which suggests that it is functionally important. Two neuropeptide Y alleles were found to differ at nine positions in 2.5 kilobase pairs at the 5' portion of the gene. No exon difference was found. One nucleotide substitution close to the gene promoter may influence the regulation of expression. Neuropeptide Y mRNA was found in all rat brain subregions tested, which shows that neuropeptide Y is synthesized throughout the brain. Developmentally, mRNA was detected in the rat brain as early as embryonic day 16 and increased rapidly to adult levels. The level of neuropeptide Y mRNA was also studied in several rat peripheral organs. Unexpectedly high levels were observed in heart and spleen. This mRNA may be synthesized in intrinsic ganglia and non-neuronal cells, respectively.\r"

This promoter directs transcription of the galT, galE, and galK genes. The second promoter, galP2, is located within the operon just upstream of the galE gene. This promoter is responsible for constitutive transcription of the galE and galK genes. Comparison of the S. lividans gal operon to the Escherichia coli gal operon indicates the presence of a constitutive promoter positioned upstream of galE in both operons.

In these vectors, an internal simian virus 40 or human metallothionein promoter sequence serves to drive the expression of the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase or guanine-xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase genes, whereas the viral long terminal repeat sequences are utilized to promote expression of inserted sequences. In some of the vectors, the viral 5' splice site, normally used in the biogenesis of the subgenomic env-encoding mRNA, has been eliminated. These vectors yield high transient and stable titers of virus after transfection of viral packaging cell lines, show little or no depression of virus titer with a variety of inserts, and faithfully transmit recombinant proviral sequences to recipient cells. To characterize the expression potential of these vectors, a variety of inserts encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the human major histocompatibility complex class II antigen HLA-DR have been introduced into these vectors.

In addition, through the sequential infection of cells with retrovirus constructions expressing two different selectable markers, both subunits of the class II antigen have been introduced into NIH 3T3 cells. Such infected cells express HLA-DR molecules at the cell surface.\r"

In crude extracts of calf brain, inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate is first converted to inositol 3,4-bisphosphate, then the inositol 3,4-bisphosphate intermediate is further converted to inositol 3-phosphate. Similarly, inositol 1,4-bisphosphate is converted to inositol 4-phosphate, and no inositol 1-phosphate is formed. We partially purified an enzyme that we tentatively name inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase. This cytosolic enzyme converts inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate to inositol 3,4-bisphosphate and also converts inositol 1,4-bisphosphate to inositol 4-phosphate. The enzyme does not utilize inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, or inositol 1-phosphate as substrates. Thus we propose a new scheme for inositol phosphate metabolism. According to this pathway inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,4-bisphosphate are degraded to inositol 4-phosphate. Inositol 1-phosphate, which is the major inositol monophosphate formed in stimulated brain, is derived either from phospholipase C cleavage of phosphatidylinositol or from the degradation of inositol cyclic phosphates.\r"

As previous in vitro studies in prokaryotes have shown that substitution of nucleotides in the anticodon region can profoundly affect tRNA aminoacylation, it is important to determine whether the mutation affects aminoacylation of these eukaryotic tRNAs. We present a method for quantitating the tRNA aminoacylation in vivo in mammalian cells, and we have determined that the suppressor tRNA(Tyr) is fully aminoacylated and suppressor tRNA(Lys) and tRNA(Gln) are aminoacylated 40-50% and 80%, respectively. This in vivo method of estimating aminoacylation may be applied to other mutations in the tRNA genes.\r"

The complete nucleotide sequence and a partial restriction map are presented. The subunit is composed of 221 amino acids with a molecular weight of 25,425 before posttranslational modification. The deduced amino acid sequence is rich in lysine, which is consistent with the relatively high pI of GST-2. The human sequence shows considerable homology with the rat Ya and Yc GST sequences but little homology with the rat GSTp and Yb subunit sequences. Southern blots of restriction digests of human DNA indicate that there may be multiple GST-2 genes. In situ hybridization of the cloned cDNA to human chromosomes produces intense labeling only over band p12 on the short arm of chromosome 6 near the centromere.

After transfer to mouse erythroleukemia cells, the expression of human alpha-globin genes from the peripheral blood or marrow cells of preleukemic patients with acquired hemoglobin H disease was similar to that of human alpha-globin genes transferred to mouse erythroleukemia cells from normal donors. These data showed that factor(s) in the mouse erythroleukemia cell can genetically complement the alpha-globin gene defect in these preleukemia patients with acquired hemoglobin H disease and suggest that altered expression of a gene in trans to the alpha-globin gene may be responsible for the acquisition of hemoglobin H disease in these patients.\r"

These are genetically defective viruses that allow transfer of nonselectable genes under the transcriptional control of internal promoters. The basic handicapped vector (pHHAM) is derived from Harvey, Abelson, and Moloney murine retroviruses. It contains a 327-base-pair deletion in the 3' long terminal repeat that spans enhancer and promoter sequences. The deletion is successfully transferred to the 5' long terminal repeat after reverse transcription of viral RNA, yielding a provirus incapable of synthesizing viral transcripts. HHAM viruses containing the mouse c-myc gene under the control of immunoglobulin kappa chain gene regulatory elements, along with a selectable gene (neo) driven by a weak promoter (tk), were stably transmitted to cultured mouse B cells. The donor c-myc gene was transcribed from the kappa promoter in these cells. Helper-free virus-producing cell lines were generated at titers favorable for the efficient introduction of HHAM viruses, even without selection, into hematopoietic stem cells from mouse bone marrow. When returned to unirradiated congenic recipient mice, the cells were capable of long-term reconstitution of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages of W/Wv mutants and the lymphoid system of scid mutants.\r"

The protein was shown to be immunochemically related to the ninth component of complement (C9) and was therefore designated C9-related protein (C9RP). Using the procedure that was developed for the isolation of C9RP from large granular lymphocytes--i.e., affinity chromatography employing anti-human C9 linked to Sepharose, a cytolytic protein has now been isolated from OKT3-activated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nineteen to 40 micrograms of active protein was obtained from 1 X 10(9) human peripheral blood mononuclear cells after the cells were cultured for 3 days with OKT3 (monoclonal antibody to cell surface antigen T3). During this period, a marked increment occurred in the amount of the cytotoxic protein contained per cell, indicating that OKT3 induced de novo synthesis of the protein. By NaDodSO4/PAGE the molecular mass was determined to be 70 kDa. By ELISA the isolated protein and C9RP of large granular lymphocytes reacted to the same extent with anti-C9RP. Using K-562 or M21 human melanoma cells as targets, the cytotoxic activity of the isolated protein, in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+, was comparable to that of C9RP. The same cytolytic protein was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were depleted of CD16+ cells prior to OKT3 activation and that consisted primarily of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. These results suggest that the cytolytic protein of OKT3-activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes is identical with C9RP of interleukin-2-stimulated large granular lymphocytes.\r"

Although it is now clear that these cells are of bone marrow origin, extensive morphological, histochemical, and cell-membrane marker studies have not definitively placed them in any known hematopoietic differentiation pathway. Based on the observation that Thy-1+ DEC can be propagated in vitro with Con A and interleukin 2, we have established three cell lines (Tehy 184, Tehy 245, and Yety 245) that can be continuously grown in medium with lectin-lymphokine-rich culture supernatants of rat spleen cells. With the exception of the loss of reactivity with anti-asialo-GM1 antibodies (Tehy 184 and Tehy 245) and the gain of interleukin 2 receptor expression, the cultured cell lines bear the same surface characteristics as freshly isolated Thy-1+ DEC: Thy-1+, Ly-5+, Lyt-1-, Lyt-2-, L3T4-, Ia-, sIg-. Using Southern and RNA gel blot analysis, we now demonstrate that these Thy-1+ DEC-derived cell lines exhibit various patterns of rearrangements in the gene complexes encoding the T-cell receptor (related) beta and gamma chains and contain mature and/or incomplete transcripts from the T-cell receptor alpha- and beta-chain genes, as well as transcripts from the receptor-related gamma-chain genes. Tehy 184 cells, the only cells containing both mature alpha- and beta-chain transcripts, react positively with the F23.1 monoclonal antibody, which recognizes the product of a subset of T-cell receptor beta-chain variable region gene segments. This antibody precipitates a surface protein of 84-88 kDa from these cells that after reduction separates into two 40- to 44-kDa chains, characteristic of Ti alpha/beta heterodimers. These data strongly suggest that Thy-1+ DEC belong to the T-cell lineage and point to the epidermis as a site either of immature thymocyte migration or of extrathymic T-cell differentiation.\r"

The activated T cells were then propagated in interleukin 2-containing medium in the presence or absence of affinity-purified glycosylation-inhibiting factor (GIF). Upon incubation with ovalbumin-pulsed macrophages, T cells propagated in the absence of GIF produced IgE-potentiating factor and glycosylation-enhancing factor. In contrast, T cells propagated in the presence of GIF produced IgE-suppressive factor and GIF. The ovalbumin-primed T cells propagated in the presence of GIF constitutively produced the 13-kDa GIF that lacked affinity for ovalbumin. However, stimulation of the same T cells with ovalbumin-pulsed macrophages resulted in the production of 80- and 35-kDa GIF that had affinity for ovalbumin. Both the antigen-specific GIF and nonspecific GIF from the activated BDF1 T cells had I-Jb determinants. Since the ovalbumin-specific GIF is derived from Lyt-2+, I-J+ ovalbumin-specific suppressor T cells and suppresses the anti-hapten antibody response to dinitrophenyl-coupled ovalbumin, the results strongly suggest that the presence of GIF during the propagation of antigen-primed T cells facilitates the generation of antigen-specific suppressor T cells.\r"

It functions both as a receptor for C3b- and C4b-coated ligands and as a regulator of complement activation. Prior structural studies have defined an unusual molecular weight allelic polymorphism in which the allelic products differ in molecular weight by as much as 90,000. On peripheral blood cells there is codominant expression of CR1 gene products of Mr 190,000 (A), 220,000 (B), 160,000 (C), and 250,000 (D). Results of prior biosynthetic and tryptic peptide mapping experiments have suggested that the most likely basis for the allelic molecular weight differences is at the polypeptide level. In order to define further the molecular basis for these molecular weight differences, human CR1 was purified to homogeneity, tryptic peptide fragments were isolated by HPLC and sequenced, oligonucleotide probes were prepared, and a CR1 cDNA was identified. A subclone of this CR1 cDNA was used as a probe of RNA blots of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell lines expressing the allelic variants. Each allelic variant encodes two distinct transcripts. A mRNA size polymorphism was identified that correlated with the gene product molecular weight polymorphism. This finding, in addition to a prior report of several homologous repeats in CR1, is consistent with the hypothesis that the molecular weight polymorphism is determined at the genomic level and may have been generated by unequal crossing-over.\r"

  ".U": "87175706\r", 
  ".W": "Cytotactin is an extracellular matrix protein that is involved in neuron-glia adhesion and is found in both neural and nonneural sites. It is synthesized by glia but not by neurons. In this study, we have examined the binding of cytotactin to a variety of extracellular matrix components using uniform microscopic beads (Covaspheres) that could be labeled and then linked to purified molecules. Cytotactin-coated beads bound well to neurons, and this binding was strongly inhibited by anti-cytotactin antibodies but not by anti-neural cell adhesion molecule (anti-N-CAM) antibodies. In contrast, the binding of N-CAM-coated beads to neurons was inhibited by anti-N-CAM antibodies and not by anti-cytotactin antibodies. To identify a neuronal ligand for cytotactin, we tested several molecules for their ability to block the binding of cytotactin-coated beads to cells. A proteoglycan-containing fraction that copurified with cytotactin from brain extracts strongly inhibited binding, whereas neither a heparan sulfate proteoglycan from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells nor soluble cytotactin itself had a significant inhibitory effect. The neural proteoglycan also inhibited the binding of cytotactin-coated beads to fibroblasts. Digestion with chondroitinase, heparitinase, and hyaluronidase as well as immunological analyses suggested that the predominant species in the active fraction was a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan with a Mr280,000 core protein bearing HNK-1 antigenic determinants and also indicated that hyaluronic acid was present in this fraction. In experiments on in vitro synthesis, it was found that the proteoglycan was synthesized in culture by embryonic chicken brain tissue but not by embryonic chicken glial cells. A series of binding experiments was performed on appropriately derivatized beads to confirm that the proteoglycan is a ligand for cytotactin and to check for the possibility that other extracellular matrix proteins might interact with one or the other member of this binding couple. Proteoglycan-coated beads and cytotactin-coated beads coaggregated readily. The aggregation was inhibitable by anti-cytotactin antibodies, soluble cytotactin, or soluble proteoglycan. Addition of laminin inhibited the binding of cytotactin-coated beads to proteoglycan-coated beads or to cells; this is consistent with data indicating that laminin interacts with a component of the proteoglycan-containing fraction. In contrast, fibronectin bound to cytotactin, but it did not bind to proteoglycan or interfere with the binding of cytotactin to proteoglycan.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The tertiary structure of avian pancreatic polypeptide has been previously derived from crystallographic data by Blundell and coworkers. The homology between neuropeptide Y and avian pancreatic polypeptide preserves all of the residues essential for the maintenance of the tertiary structure. Thus, it has been possible to compute a three-dimensional model of the mammalian neuropeptide, neuropeptide Y, based on the known structure of the avian homologue. This model suggest that neuropeptide preserves a compact tertiary structure characterized by extensive hydrophobic interactions between an N-terminal polyproline-II-like helix and a C-terminal alpha-helix. The model has been used to identify amino acids residing in key positions within this structure and, thereby, to direct future analysis of neuropeptide Y structure-function relationships.\r"

  ".W": "This study compared the effects of unilateral and bilateral auricular transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on cutaneous pain threshold. Auricular acupuncture points were stimulated with low frequency, high intensity TENS for 45 seconds. Sixty healthy, adult subjects were assigned randomly to one of two treatment groups or to a control group. The two treatment groups received low frequency, high intensity TENS either unilaterally or bilaterally. The control group did not receive auricular stimulation. Experimental pain threshold at the left wrist was determined with a painful stimulus before and after auricular stimulation. Both unilateral and bilateral auricular stimulation groups exhibited a significant increase (p less than .05) in experimental pain threshold, but the control group did not. The mean change values between the unilateral and bilateral stimulation groups were not statistically different. These results suggest that both unilateral and bilateral auricular TENS can increase pain threshold.\r"

  ".W": "Comparison of amino acid sequences from human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and avian erythroblastosis virus erbB oncogene product suggests that v-erbB represents a truncated avian EGF receptor gene product. Although both proteins are transmembrane tyrosine kinases, the v-erbB protein lacks most of the extracellular ligand-binding domain and a 32-amino acid cytoplasmic sequence present in the human EGF receptor. To test the validity of the proposed origin of v-erbB and to investigate the functional significance of the deleted extracellular sequences, a chimeric gene encoding the extracellular and the transmembrane domain of the human EGF receptor joined to sequences coding for the cytoplasmic domain of the avian erbB oncogene product was constructed. When expressed in Rat1 fibroblasts, this reconstituted gene product (HER-erbB) was transported to the cell surface and bound EGF. Its autophosphorylation activity was stimulated by interaction with the ligand. Expression of the HER-erbB chimera led to anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar and EGF-induced focus formation in Rat1 monolayers. Thus, it appears that v-erbB protein sequences in the chimeric receptor retain their transforming activity under the influence of the human extracellular EGF-binding domain.\r"

Aortic elastase modified by local antiprotease activity (elastase/a-1-antitrypsin) was significantly higher in patients with a ruptured AAA compared with patients with an elective AAA or occlusive aortic disease: 241 nanograms per milligram of tissue in AAA-rupture versus 57 nanograms per milligram of tissue in AAA-elective versus 32 nanograms per milligram of tissue for occlusive (p less than 0.003). Patients with a ruptured AAA had the highest elastase activity (354 nanograms per milligram of tissue) and the lowest a-1-antitrypsin (1.07 nanograms per milligram of tissue) compared with patients with an elective AAA and occlusion (p less than 0.05). These data suggest that the homeostatic balance between elastase and antiprotease may be significantly altered in the aortic wall at the time of aneurysm rupture. Increased elastase unchecked by low antiprotease results in increased elastin breakdown which may be the inciting event for rupture of a compromised, thin aortic aneurysm wall.\r"

The amyloid was found to be of immunoglobulin origin, AL amyloid. Other reports of localized gastric amyloidosis are reviewed and compared with the present case. Most of the patients were clinically suspected of gastric carcinoma, and only one had hematemesis. We propose that amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hematemesis and gastric tumors.\r"

Healthy subjects were defined as normotensive, receiving no cardiac or antihypertensive medications, nonobese and free of cardiopulmonary disease. Echocardiographic criteria (in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography convention) for LV hypertrophy, based on mean plus 2 standard deviations for LV mass, LV mass corrected for body surface area and LV mass corrected for height in this healthy sample are, respectively: 294 g, 150 g/m2 and 163 g/m in men and 198 g, 120 g/m2 and 121 g/m in women. Criteria based on LV mass/height result in higher prevalence rates of LV hypertrophy than LV mass/body surface area while still correcting for body size. The prevalence of LV hypertrophy in the entire study population (using LV mass/height criteria) is 16% in men and 19% in women. Until outcome guided criteria for LV hypertrophy are developed, application of sex-specific criteria based on a healthy population distribution of LV mass offer the best approach to echocardiographic diagnosis of LV hypertrophy.\r"

The peak values in summer (110 +/- 33 pmol/L) were not different from those of the younger controls.

All infants received washed red blood cell products; 37 infants received nonleukodepleted platelets and/or plasma. There were 7.4 donor exposures per infant. Donor units were assayed for anti-CMV IgG and IgM at the time of donation. Seventy-six infants received at least one transfusion from a seropositive donor (mean transfusion volume, 89 mL; mean, 3.7 seropositive donor exposures). Infection was defined by seroconversion to anti-CMV. None of the recipients of exclusively seronegative blood seroconverted. A single infant who received 34 mL of washed cells from a seropositive donor (IgG+, IgM-) and 31 mL of washed cells from a seronegative donor showed IgM anti-CMV 15 days after transfusion and IgG anti-CMV at a six-week follow-up visit. No recipients of IgM+ blood were infected. Our data demonstrate a 1.3% incidence of anti-CMV seroconversion following receipt of washed red cells from seropositive donors. This rate is within background levels for hospitalized neonates and is significantly lower than results of similar studies using unwashed blood.\r"

Intestinal damage, determined by measuring random fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin concentrations in 206 infants aged 2 to 17 weeks and fecal hemoglobin concentrations in 200 of these, was not more likely in infants with colic at the time of study. The occurrence of adverse reactions at the time of introduction of fresh whole cow's milk into the diet of previously colicky infants was uncommon. Our results suggest that dietary protein hypersensitivity is probably not the cause of colic in most healthy young infants.\r"

The human cDNA was used as a probe in Southern transfers of TaqI-digested genomic DNA from mouse/human somatic-cell hybrids to localize the human creatine kinase-M gene to chromosome 19. In situ hybridization of the tritiated cDNA probe to metaphase chromosomes of peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal males revealed significant labeling to chromosome 19. These two independent methodologies assign the human creatine kinase-M gene to chromosome 19. Since greater than 69% of the grains of chromosome 19 label band q13, the human creatine kinase-M gene has been mapped to 19q13.

The most common site of bleeding was gastrointestinal, and one patient died from bleeding. Four independent risk factors for major in-hospital bleeding were identified and weighted using multivariate discriminant analysis in a randomly chosen group of 411 patients: co-morbid conditions other than the indication for anticoagulant therapy (specific signs of heart, liver, or kidney dysfunction, cancer, and severe anemia); the use of heparin to begin therapy in patients age 60 years or older; the intensity of therapy (measured by the maximal prothrombin time or partial thromboplastin time); and liver dysfunction that worsened during treatment. These findings were validated in an independent testing group of 206 patients; the risk factors identified 151 patients at low (1 percent) risk of major bleeding, 33 at moderate (6 percent) risk, and 22 at high (23 percent) risk. The accuracy and clinical impact of this prediction rule should be evaluated further in other hospitals.\r"

To prospectively evaluate the influence of HLA-DR4 on pulmonary involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary function was measured in four groups of subjects with rheumatoid arthritis in whom HLA-DR4 and smoking status was known: 16 DR4-positive smokers (six current and 10 exsmokers), 16 DR4-negative smokers (six current and 10 exsmokers), eight DR4-positive nonsmokers, and eight DR4-negative nonsmokers. Significant reductions in one-second forced expiratory volume and forced vital capacity were observed in DR4-positive subjects compared with DR4-negative subjects irrespective of cigarette smoking status. In addition, patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (secondary Sjogren's syndrome) demonstrated significant reductions in one-second forced expiratory volume, forced vital capacity, and ratio of one-second forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity compared with those patients without evidence of secondary Sjogren's syndrome. It is concluded that the presence of the HLA-DR4 antigen and secondary Sjogren's syndrome are associated with abnormal pulmonary function in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

Eight eyes of five patients developed rhegmatogenous retinal detachment after initiation of treatment. Multiple breaks in areas of peripheral, healed, atrophic retina accounted for the detachments. All seven eyes that underwent surgery had extensive retinal detachments that were reattached with vitrectomy and silicone oil. Retinotomy and retinal tacks were necessary in two cases that were complicated by severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy. In the fellow eye of one patient, laser treatment was used prophylactically to wall off a peripheral patch of healed retinitis. Endoretinal biopsies and culture were taken in five eyes; evidence of persistent cytomegalovirus was seen in two cases despite concurrent and clinically effective antiviral therapy.\r"

We found no obvious differences in the age, sex, clinical appearance, or ophthalmic findings between patients with unilateral and those with bilateral ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasms. Five orbital and two conjunctival lymphoid neoplasms removed from five patients were polyclonal pseudolymphomas, while nine orbital, eight conjunctival, and two eyelid lymphoid neoplasms removed from 12 patients were monoclonal B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Each pair of simultaneously bilateral lesions occurring in a single individual was morphologically and immunologically identical and exhibited identical immunoglobulin gene DNA rearrangement patterns. None of the five patients with polyclonal pseudolymphomas developed nonocular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but one developed a contralateral conjunctival monoclonal B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Six of the 12 patients with ocular adnexal monoclonal B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas developed nonocular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The incidence of previous or subsequent systemic nonocular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients with bilateral ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasms is comparable to that of patients with unilateral disease. In both patient groups, the development of nonocular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is most commonly associated with ocular adnexal lymphoid neoplasms displaying follicular or diffuse small cleaved cell (poorly differentiated lymphocytic) morphologic characteristics.\r"

No staining occurred with 65 of the antibodies; however, 5 antibodies marked small lymphocytes in the T-cell areas of human tonsil. Two antibodies which strongly labeled lymphocytes, UCHL1 and T2/48, were used to examine 106 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 29 cases of Hodgkin's disease, and a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues. UCHL1 and T2/48 each marked 86% (37/43) of B5-fixed T-cell lymphomas. Only 50% of formalin-fixed T-cell lymphomas were marked with these antibodies. UCHL1 marked 1.8% (1/56) of the B-cell lymphomas, compared with T2/48, which marked 19.6% (11/56) of the B-cell lymphomas. T2/48 had the interesting attribute of marking cells of the follicular mantle-zone and intermediate lymphocytic lymphoma, suggesting that the antibody recognizes a B-cell differentiation antigen. No Reed-Sternberg cells, epithelial neoplasms, sarcomas, neurogenic tumors, or normal nonlymphoid tissue were marked by either antibody. These antibodies successfully mark T cells in paraffin tissue sections and should aid in the investigation and characterization of abnormal lymphoid proliferations, \"undifferentiated\" malignant neoplasms, and immunologically mediated disorders.\r"

Significant correlations were observed between the serum-IgE levels and proportions of Fc epsilon R+ T cells (r = .71, P greater than .002). In contrast, no differences were observed between the groups in the proportions of PBMC and T cells bearing receptors for Fc fragment of IgG (Fc8R) when measured with model IgG-immunocomplexes. The proportions of cells reacting with monoclonal anti-IgE (9G2), T11 (E receptor), Leu-2a (suppressor), Leu-3a (helper), Leu-4 (pan-T), Leu-12 (pan-B), and anti-polyvalent immunoglobulin did not differ significantly between the groups. The results indicate that Fc epsilon R+ T cells are increased in patients with atopic asthma, suggesting that these cells may be involved in the regulation and/or synthesis of IgE antibody formation in man.\r"

A total of 6,405 visits was evaluated, resulting in overall rates of inappropriate use and unmet need of 42% and 58%, respectively. When paramedic ambulance services were compared to nonparamedic services, the results indicated less inappropriate use in cities with paramedic services (34% vs 49%, P less than .001) as well as less unmet need in cities with paramedic services (48% vs 67%, P less than .001). These results remain consistent within most sample subgroups based on age, sex, time of arrival at ED, and disposition, except that no differences were found for small cities or for patients 50 years and older. The results indicate that paramedic ambulance systems are beneficial to the general population of emergency department users.\r"

  ".W": "Intrapleural injection of Corynebacterium parvum (CBP) has been recently proposed as a useful symptomatic treatment of recurrent malignant effusions. Although the result is often a fibrotic thickening of the pleura, CBP is thought to stimulate the effector cells present in the effusion and, possibly, to activate the antitumor cytotoxic activity of the pleural fluid mononuclear cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied 7 patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusions caused by lung cancer and evaluated the cellular composition, the proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations, and the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells in the pleural fluid before and 7 days after injection of CBP in the pleural space. The CBP treatment induced a marked decrease in the rate of accumulation of pleural fluid (p less than 0.01) and in the concentration of immune effector cells in the pleural exudate (p less than 0.001). These changes were associated with a decrease in the percentages of pleural fluid monocytes and lymphocytes present (p less than 0.01, each comparison) and to a marked increase in the percentages of pleural fluid neutrophils (p less than 0.001). No significant changes in the proportions of T- and B-lymphocytes or in the proportions of helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic T-cells or of natural killer cells were observed in the pleural exudate after CBP treatment (p greater than 0.2, each comparison). In addition, the cytotoxic activity of pleural fluid mononuclear cells was similar before and after CBP treatment (p greater than 0.2), and the levels of interferon, as a marker of immunoactivation of mononuclear cells, were not changed after treatment (p greater than 0.2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because it is not deaminated by deaminase in serum, as is adenosine arabinoside, (+)-cyclaradine is about 2 to 5 times more active in vitro against herpes simplex virus. (+)-Cyclaradine has in vitro activity nearly equivalent to that of phosphonoformate but is significantly less active than acycloguanosine (acyclovir; ACV), trifluorothymidine, or 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine. The absolute ratios of in vitro activities are difficult to determine because of variability among virus strains, inoculum size, and dependence on the tissue culture cell line in which the comparative test is carried out. (+)-Cyclaradine is active against TK-, ACV-resistant mutants. In the guinea pig model of vaginal herpes simplex virus infection, (+)-cyclaradine is only slightly less active than ACV when both molecules are nearly equivalently bioavailable; thus, the large difference in activity seen in vitro is not reflected in this in vivo model system.\r"

In rats immunosuppressed by 5 weeks of pretreatment with dexamethasone, a 2-week course of 5 mg of aerosolized pentamidine per kg per day, administered free or encapsulated in the drug carrier system (liposomes), eradicated P. carinii pneumonia in 75% of treated animals. At this dose, extrapulmonary drug uptake as measured by a sensitive high-pressure liquid chromatography assay was negligible. No significant differences in tissue distribution were noted between aerosolized free and liposome-encapsulated pentamidine. In rats receiving dexamethasone for 6 weeks prior to treatment with pentamidine, both lung uptake and therapeutic efficacy of aerosolized pentamidine (5 mg/kg per day) were substantially reduced. Aerosolized pentamidine appears to be an effective therapy for P. carinii pneumonia in rats and produces significantly lower extrapulmonary drug deposition than parenteral administration. The severity of P. carinii involvement at the time of treatment influences both the level of drug delivery to the lung and the response to aerosolized pentamidine therapy.\r"

To see whether typical type 1 diabetes occurred in Asian children in the United Kingdom, all known Asian children with diabetes in industrial West Yorkshire were ascertained. A total of 17 such children were studied; of these, seven were from three multiplex families and two fathers from these families had diabetes. All children were ketosis prone and developed diabetes while resident in the UK. There were significant increases in HLA-B8 and HLA-DR3 and increases in HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR3/DR4, while HLA-B15 was absent. Islet cell antibodies, either IgG or complement fixing, were present in four of 18 subjects tested, all of whom had disease of short duration. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes in Asian children aged 15 years or less in West Yorkshire was 36/100,000, assuming complete ascertainment. It is concluded that typical type 1 diabetes may occur in Asian children and this condition may be more common in families who have migrated to the UK.\r"

  ".W": "Cardiac catheterization was performed in a prospective series of 1000 patients under consideration for elective peripheral vascular reconstruction at the Cleveland Clinic from 1978-1982. Of these, 246 patients (mean age: 68 years) presented primarily because of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and are eligible for subsequent evaluation 3-7 years (mean: 4.6 years) after entrance into the study. Severe, surgically correctable coronary artery disease (CAD) was documented in 78 patients (32%) in the AAA group, and 70 patients (28%) received myocardial revascularization with four fatal complications (5.7%). A total of 56 patients in this subset had staged aneurysm resection, usually during the same hospital admission after coronary bypass, with a single death (1.8%) caused by cerebral infarction. The overall operative mortality rate for 126 coronary and AAA procedures was 4%. A total of 59 additional patients (25%) died during the late follow-up interval, including 14 patients (5.9%) with cardiac events and eight patients (3.4%) with ruptured aneurysms. The cumulative 5-year survival rate (75%) and cardiac mortality rate (5%) after coronary bypass reflected traditional parameters (preoperative ventricular function, completeness of revascularization) and are nearly identical to the results calculated for patients having normal coronary arteries or only mild to moderate CAD. In comparison, the cumulative survival and cardiac mortality rates in a small subset of patients with severe, uncorrected coronary involvement currently are 29% (p = 0.0001) and 34%, respectively. These data support the conclusion that selected patients who require elective resection of AAA also warrant myocardial revascularization to enhance perioperative risk and late survival.\r"

The potential use of this substance for cardiovascular surgery was evaluated in a canine arterial bleeding model, which allowed comparison of the new agent with previously used pure collagen (CHF) as well as study of the hemostyptic under elevated blood pressure conditions. The results revealed that FTCH induced reliable hemostasis in 10-mm injuries of the canine hypogastric artery up to a systolic blood pressure of 260 mmHg, whereas bleeding control by CHF alone was impossible. To assess the long-term reliability of FTCH, the dogs were re-explored at intervals of 14 and 31 days after operation. At relaparotomy, the arteries were patent and there was no evidence of recurrent bleeding, thrombosis formation, or aneurysmatic changes. Histologic examinations showed well-healed vascular lesions covered by cell-depleted collagen tissue and a partially resorped hemostyptic. FTCH will not replace adequate surgical techniques but could be useful as a quickly available and easily applicable hemostatic means in otherwise uncontrollable diffuse or acute bleeding in cardiovascular surgery.\r"

In normal individuals, CPT measures increase with increasing stimulation frequency, are highest on the toe and lowest on the face. There is a significant effect of age and sex on threshold perception. In patients with neuropathy, there is a marked increase in thresholds on hands and feet, as well as a lesser but still significant increase of facial CPTs. Thresholds furthermore correlated with clinical severity in a group of patients with diabetic neuropathy. Facial thresholds were markedly elevated in the patients with moderate to severe neuropathy, suggesting that the device is sensitive to the systemic nature of peripheral neuropathy. The authors believe the device will be a useful tool in screening for sensory neurologic abnormalities.\r"

Pharmacologic control of this process is of potential clinical relevance. The in vitro effect of therapeutic concentrations of select nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs on the synthesis and activity of catabolism-inducing cytokines produced by 6-day explant cultures of osteoarthritic and rheumatoid synovial tissue was studied. Piroxicam regularly suppressed such factor synthesis by both types of tissue without significantly affecting total protein synthesis. This did not occur using sodium salicylate or indomethacin in osteoarthritis tissue cultures and was observed only occasionally in rheumatoid arthritis cultures. None of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs studied consistently blocked catabolism-inducing activity in osteoarthritis tissue, whereas piroxicam more consistently inhibited activity produced by rheumatoid arthritis tissue. Results suggest that the catabolism-inducing factors produced by the 2 tissue sources may differ.\r"

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the lymphocyte transformation assay were used to determine immunity. Antibody to antigen S was present significantly more frequently in children with JRA-uveitis than in children with JRA alone, children with nonrheumatic disorders, or controls. These latter groups did not differ in positivity for this antibody. Lymphocyte transformation occurred more frequently in children with JRA-uveitis than in children with JRA alone or controls. Children with JRA alone and controls had similar frequencies of lymphocyte transformation positivity. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay positivity and lymphocyte transformation positivity tended to occur in different children. Children with JRA-uveitis who had HLA-B35 had the highest frequency of antibody to antigen S. Immunity to antigen S may be the result of ocular damage by mechanisms other than a pathogenic mechanism per se.\r"

Discordance between results of rotation tests (evaluating the compensation for the VOR) and posturographic (PG) results (evaluating compensation for the VSR) are observed in 50% of the patients with UVH. The complaint of \"instability\" shows correlation with abnormal PG data.

No butyrylcholinesterase or nonspecific acetylcholinesterase activity was found. The results indicate a dense localization of acetylcholinesterase activity beneath and between the hair cells, at the sensory epithelial and subepithelial junction, and within vascular elements. This reaction product extends along the entire length of the sensory epithelium. Activity also extends proximally to the areas of the nerves' entrance into the subepithelial tissue. It should be noted that most of the activity is likely to be located in the extracellular matrix, as well as in the endoneurium. This extracellular distribution may represent an enzymatic barrier to the diffusion of acetylcholine that may be essential for the normal function of the end organ and possibly similar to the blood-brain barrier in some respects.\r"

The administration of suxamethonium produced an increase in IOP in all groups, more so in those given thiopentone, in whom it exceeded the control values. Intubation of the trachea produced the greatest increase in IOP, averaging about 25% above control in all groups except in the group given the additional dose of propofol, in whom IOP remained below control values throughout the process of induction and intubation. Ten patients (33%) experienced pain on injection with propofol.

The target cells used in the CSA assays were from peripheral blood or bone marrow. Unstimulated B cells produced CSA in amounts similar to those present in the GCT-conditioned medium used as a positive control. The B cell-derived CSA predominantly promoted the growth of colonies that contained macrophages alone or macrophages and granulocytes. CSA eluted in a single peak from a G-75 Sephadex column with an approximate molecular weight (mw) of 65 to 70 kilodaltons (kd). Fractionation of tonsil B lymphocytes on Percoll density gradients showed that large B cells, probably already activated in vivo, were the main source of CSA. By contrast, small, resting B cells recovered from a different fraction of the Percoll gradient released minimum amounts or no CSA. However, these B cells became CSA producers following stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) in vitro. B cells purified from the peripheral blood of nine out of 12 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) also released CSA in vitro in the absence of stimuli. These findings suggest that by releasing CSA, B cells may have a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis and in the control of the inflammatory process.\r"

PBL from four of 12 patients were not capable of generating such a response after stimulation in vitro, whereas all controls were normal. This negative plaque-forming cell (PFC) response coincided with the presence of antibodies directed toward human T-lymphotropic virus III/lymphadenopathy-associated virus (HTLV-III/LAV). Only one patient with antibodies against HTLV-III/LAV had a normal PFC response. The negative PFC response was not due to a deficient T helper cell activity, nor to an excessive T suppressor cell function. However, in the peripheral blood of these four patients, the presence of activated B cells that are refractory to antigen-specific T helper cell signals and secrete specific antibodies spontaneously could be demonstrated. Most of the patients showed a hyperimmunoglobulinemia. No correlation between the T4/T8 ratio and the level of the PFC response was demonstrable. From the data obtained in these investigations we raise the hypothesis that infection with HTLV-III/LAV in hemophilia patients will lead to in vivo (pre)activation of B cells that results in unresponsiveness or decreased response to antigen-specific signals.\r"

Conditioned medium from the Mo T cell line (MoCM) was used as a standard positive control. We found that activities of GM-CSF and Ppo alpha on the growth of hematopoietic colonies were indistinguishable; Ppo alpha is now believed to be identical to GM-CSF. Both factors were able to promote the growth of colonies derived from subpopulations of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEM. Colonies derived from CFU-GM and CFU-GEM in cultures stimulated by GM-CSF and Ppo alpha were much smaller than in cultures stimulated by MoCM. In contrast to previous reports in which less highly enriched progenitors were used as target cells, Ppo had no detectable activity on the growth of colonies derived from BFU-E or CFU-GEM but promoted the growth of a subpopulation of CFU-GM derived colonies. Ppo is now recognized to be identical to G-CSF. The GM colonies in cultures stimulated by G-CSF (Ppo) were much smaller than in cultures stimulated by MoCM. EPA had no detectable activity on either the size or number of colonies derived from CFU-GM, BFU-E, or CFU-GEM. Results from experiments using target cell populations of marrow fractions separated by velocity sedimentation and marrow populations following freezing suggested that GM-CSF (Ppo alpha) and G-CSF (Ppo) primarily affect the growth of relatively mature subpopulations of progenitor cells. It is clear from these results that additional factor(s) are present in MoCM that are necessary to stimulate CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEM maximally in vitro.\r"

Tomographic images were produced of the distribution of 124I in the thyroid. Functioning volumes were found to be in the range 21-79 cm3 with volume errors of the order of +/- 4% to +/- 14%. Radioiodine uptake varied from 28% to 98%. Using a value of 6 days for the effective half-life of radioiodine in hyperactive thyroids, radiation doses from a standard therapy administration of 75 MBq of 131I varied from 11 to 48 Gy (compared with a recommended 50-70 Gy). In five cases PET imaging showed a non-uniform distribution of radioiodine in thyroids thought to have uniform uptake from conventional pinhole scintigraphy.\r"

Of 133 families surveyed 127 (95%) responded to the questionnaire. About one third of the parents did not have their children vaccinated. The decision against vaccination was made despite parent education, follow-up telephone contact and the pediatrician's expressed support of the vaccine program. Most of the respondents (86%) had no previous knowledge of the vaccine. The factor of greatest concern was the possibility of an adverse reaction. This concern was significantly more common among the parents who decided not to have their children vaccinated than among those who had their children vaccinated (chi 2 = 6.52, p less than 0.025). One third of the parents who indicated that they intended to have their children vaccinated required a telephone reminder. The findings suggest a need for public education about the vaccine, with particular emphasis directed at allaying fears about side effects.\r"

Seven leukemic phase patients (Group 1) had a mean leukocyte count of 48,870/microliter at entry with a mean absolute hairy cell (HC) count of 40,100/microliter. After 3 months on IFN, both parameters decreased significantly (WBC 3,500/microliter; HC count 130/microliter). In eight patients with a cytopenic form of the disease (Group 2) the mean leukocyte count rose from 2950/microliter to 3890/microliter while the mean absolute HC count decreased from 300/microliter to 120/microliter. The morphologic shifts correlated well with changes in the Moab reaction pattern. In Group 1 the activity of all Moab decreased significantly. In Group 2, only cells expressing Leu 3a and Leu 11a (a marker of natural killer cells) showed a significant shift, the latter increasing from 170/microliter to 360/microliter. This increase in natural killer cell antigen expression was not obvious based on routine morphologic observations alone. We show that flow cytometry may be a useful adjunct in monitoring the response of HCL to therapy. Changes in populations of cells that may be difficult to discriminate on morphologic grounds alone may be observed.\r"

  ".W": "The immunologic and clinicopathologic features of common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)-positive and CALLA-negative T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and of CALLA-positive non-T, non-B ALL (common ALL) of childhood were compared. Twenty-seven percent of children with T-ALL had blasts that expressed CALLA. This expression was not associated with a significantly different incidence of expression of sheep erythrocyte-rosette receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, peanut agglutinin receptors, or T-cell antigens. CALLA-positive T-cell blasts were more likely to express a p24 leukemia-associated antigen (CD9, 50% versus 8%) and Ia antigens (39% versus 8%) than were CALLA-negative blasts. Patients with CALLA-positive and CALLA-negative T-ALL had similar clinicopathologic features at diagnosis. In contrast, compared to patients with common ALL, patients with CALLA-positive T-ALL were older, had higher leukocyte counts, and an increased incidence of splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and mediastinal mass, similar to patients with CALLA-negative T-ALL. Patients with CALLA-positive T-ALL were more likely to achieve a complete remission (95% versus 83%, P = 0.055) and tended to have an increased duration of event-free survival (P = 0.07) than did patients with CALLA-negative T-ALL. The expression of T-cell antigens is more important than the expression of CALLA in defining biologically similar subgroups of childhood ALL. Preliminary evidence suggests that within T-ALL the expression of CALLA may be prognostically important.\r"

  ".W": "This study demonstrates endothelium-dependent relaxation in the surface arterioles of the brain. A helium-neon laser was used to injure endothelium in situ following i.v. injection of Evans blue dye, which sensitizes the bed to the laser. Areas 18 or 36 micron in diameter were injured and no longer relaxed to either 1 ml of acetylcholine chloride or bradykinin triacetate, 80 micrograms/ml delivered for 60 seconds. Dilations to sodium nitroprusside (30 micrograms/ml) were unaffected. Normal responses to nitroprusside, plus electron microscopy, established that vascular smooth muscle was uninjured. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was impaired when only minor ultrastructural damage was present. Dilation was inhibited downstream and upstream as far as 80 micron from the center of the laser beam. This suggests a spread of endothelium injury around the site of laser impact. However, inhibition was somewhat more marked downstream than upstream, implying that a portion of the downstream response was dependent on a substance released from an upstream site. To date, very few studies have reported endothelium-dependent relaxation in vivo, especially in the microcirculation. The present study accomplishes this. Moreover, in contrast to in vitro observations of endothelium-dependent relaxation in large vessels, the in vivo elimination of endothelium-dependent relaxation in the microcirculation required neither removal of endothelium nor injury to large numbers of endothelium cells. Since endothelium-dependent relaxation in the microcirculation has now been demonstrated using three different techniques to injure endothelium, it is reasonable to conclude that the phenomenon is real.\r"

All patients underwent imaging after injection of 35 to 45 ml of meglumine diatrizoate (Renografin-76; 7 to 9 ml/sec for 5 sec) into an arm vein. Electrocardiographically triggered images were acquired over eight to 16 tomographic levels at 1 cm intervals from aortic arch to mid left ventricle. Criteria for graft patency were contrast opacification on at least two noncontinguous levels and contrast density-time curves morphologically similar to that of the aorta. Ultrafast CT correctly determined that 46 of 48 bypass grafts were patent and 31 of 32 were occluded (sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy 96%, 97%, and 96%); there were no interpretation errors in 23 (92%) of the 25 patients. Accuracy was independent of vessel bypassed and not different for saphenous veins (96%) compared with internal mammary bypasses (100%). This study establishes a 20 min outpatient intravenous injection technique that is highly accurate for determining patency of coronary artery bypass grafts.\r"

Two groups of 8 patients each were studied, the first one on an interdialytic day, the second immediately after the end of an hemodialysis session. All subjects ingested a single dose of 1 gram of erythromycin ethylsuccinate. Times of peak serum concentration and biological half-lifes were similar in patients and in controls. Maximum serum concentrations and areas under the serum concentration time-curve were higher in patients than in controls whereas apparent oral clearances were lower in the former. The differences between the two groups of patients were not significant. These pharmacokinetic changes are suggestive of an enhanced bioavailability of erythromycin in chronic renal failure which might predispose uremics to the ototoxicity of the drug.\r"

There are three major parts entered on separate forms: history and surgery (Form 1); initial evaluation and follow-up (Form 2); and complications (Form 3). Form 1 has five sections: patient information (demography); history of injury; previous surgery; surgery performed; and postoperative course. Form 2 has six sections. These are the Lysholm knee function scoring scale, Tegner activity level rating scale, physical findings, complications, supplementary data, and Tegner activity level definitions. Form 2 records the preoperative and follow-up assessments for up to a five-year follow-up period. Form 2 can be used independently of the other forms. Form 3 elaborates in a detailed manner a complication occurrence. The format provides the evaluator with an easy to use, \"computer/user friendly,\" method for the comprehensive assessment of artificial or autologous anterior cruciate reconstruction of the knee. The authors advocate the use of the ACL format as an international standard for data storage to facilitate comparison of results with accuracy and uniformity among investigation centers.\r"

We investigated the safety of im and iv pentamidine, monitoring hemodynamics after each dose in 11 patients with intra-arterial lines. Results showed only a small (but statistically significant) fall in mean arterial pressure after both im and slow (60 min) iv administration. A concomitant decrease in pulse occurred, but no change in cardiac output, pulmonary capillary occlusion pressure or systemic vascular resistance was noted. These results suggest that it may be safe to infuse pentamidine slowly intravenously. This route is more comfortable to patients than im administration.\r"

Data were taken at the following intervals: 4 to 5 h after terminating the cardiopulmonary bypass, after rewarming, the next morning on controlled ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) breathing, and after extubation. The patients were followed for 14 days. Prophylactic nitroglycerin infusion may have increased the need for plasma expansion. After volume loading, the stroke index increased in both groups, but the left ventricular stroke work index increased in group 2 only. After transition to the CPAP mode, hydrostatic pressures increased, more in group 2, doubling the pulmonary shunt flow. Pulmonary extravascular thermal volume did not change in either group. We conclude that hemodynamic stability occurred faster with dextran, and ventilatory weaning was somewhat easier with crystalloid.\r"

Early intervention by coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary bypass surgery (CABG) was advocated to minimize such risk and/or maintain coronary reperfusion. Of 71 consecutive patients (60 men, 11 women; mean age, 54.9 years) who underwent IC-SK infusion for acute myocardial infarction (MI) 50 had early CABG, 18 had PTCA, and three had both procedures. Sixty-four of the 71 had successful thrombolysis. Thirty-six patients had either CABG or PTCA within three days, 22 patients within seven days, and 13 patients within two weeks. There was no immediate or in-hospital mortality, and all patients remained alive through the follow-up period of three to 36 months. Functional class (FC) 1 was achieved in 45 patients, FC 2 in 22 patients, FC 3 in three patients, and FC 4 in one patient. Sixty-seven patients (94 percent) were free of chest pain through the follow-up period. These data suggest that early intervention by CABG and/or PTCA in suitable candidates could be achieved with reduced risk and expected to yield favorable results. This favorable trend could be related to maintenance of myocardial perfusion by these procedures, initially induced by thrombolysis. Long-term, large-scale studies are needed to confirm the role of optimal timing of such procedures, but we believe that such results indicate that early revascularization yields promising results.\r"

Eighteen patients (44%) had UGI endoscopic abnormalities. Six patients had both gastric and duodenal lesions. Eight patients had only gastric polyps, and four had duodenal polyps only. The presence of other extracolonic expressions of polyposis had a suggestive but statistically insignificant correlation with UGI polyps. Patients with familial polyposis and duodenal adenomatous polyps are at high risk for the development of periampullary cancer; screening and identification of these individuals is recommended.\r"

We studied four groups of animals; one control group received saline orogastrically followed by buffer and one test group received saline followed by buffer plus 1 mM lysophosphatidylcholine. Two other groups were challenged with 20% ethanol (5 ml) orogastrically followed by buffer or buffer plus 1 mM lysophosphatidylcholine. Compared to other groups, the stomachs of animals given ethanol followed by lysophosphatidylcholine displayed statistically significant increases in the number of gross hemorrhagic lesions, in back-diffusion of hydrogen ion, in net secretion of sodium ion, and in morphologic damage. Transmucosal potential differences in this group were also decreased. We conclude that 90 min after dosing with ethanol, the guinea pig stomach is more susceptible to damage by lysophosphatidylcholine. Our data further suggest that these agents cause mucosal damage by different mechanisms and that the combination acts synergistically.\r"

  ".U": "87190057\r", 
  ".W": "Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) exists in nerves throughout the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, and exogenous CGRP has been reported to inhibit many endocrine and exocrine secretions of the gut and pancreas. Because somatostatin also has widespread inhibitory actions and because both gut and pancreatic somatostatin secretion may be under peptidergic control, we examined the influence of CGRP on circulating levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SLI) and on hormone output from the duodenal lobe of the dog pancreas in situ. Intravenous infusion of human CGRP in anesthetized dogs increased arterial SLI in a dose-dependent manner. During iv infusion of CGRP at 500 pmol/min, the increment of circulating SLI (change at 20 min, +175 +/- 24 fmol/ml) was composed of nearly equimolar amounts of SLI-14 and SLI-28, suggesting an effect of CGRP on both gastric and intestinal somatostatin secretion. The effect of iv CGRP (500 pmol/min) on arterial SLI exceeded those of iv CCK-8 (440 pmol/min), iv isoproterenol (10 nmol/min), and intragastric administration of acidified liver extract. In contrast, salmon calcitonin (500 pmol/min, iv) was without effect. CGRP did not stimulate pancreatic SLI output when infused iv (500 pmol/min) or when infused directly into a pancreatic artery (5 pmol/min). The pancreatic infusion of CGRP decreased insulin output slightly (change at 20 min, -21 +/- 8%), but did not affect glucagon output. We conclude that CGRP is a most effective yet selective stimulator of gastrointestinal somatostatin release, with little influence on islet function. We suggest that exogenous and possibly endogenous neuronal CGRP could exert inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal function via the release of somatostatin.\r"

  ".W": "In the present studies, we have investigated the role of human chorionic gonadotropin on the biosynthesis of androgens by placentas and corpora lutea of the pregnant rat. We first sought to compare the effect of hCG on placental and ovarian secretion of androstenedione in vivo. For this purpose either 1.5 IU hCG or vehicle was administered to pregnant rats twice on days 12 and 13 and once on the morning of day 14. Blood was obtained from either the ovarian or the uterine vein. After hCG administration, levels of androstenedione secreted in the ovarian vein increased dramatically, whereas those in the uterine vein declined significantly. To establish that changes in androgen levels in the uterine and ovarian veins are due to changes in biosynthetic activity and also to compare the action of hCG on placentas and corpora lutea, tissues were dissected out from rats treated with 0, 1.5, or 9 IU hCG twice daily and incubated in vitro. hCG administration increased the capacity of luteal cells to synthesize androstenedione de novo by approximately 100% and concomitantly decreased placental secretion of androstenedione by approximately 75%. Addition of high density lipoprotein to the medium enhanced both basal and hCG-stimulated androstenedione production by luteal tissues but had no effect on either basal or hCG-inhibited androstenedione biosynthesis by the placenta. To determine which step in the placental biosynthesis of androstenedione is inhibited by increased levels of LH, we determined the effect of hCG administration, on cholesterol biosynthesis and storage, synthesis of progesterone substrate, and the activities of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase. hCG did not affect the activities of the rate limiting cholesterogenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, placental content of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester, or the placental production of progesterone. However, hCG did cause a substantial decrease in the activity of 17 alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase enzyme(s); responsible for the conversion of progesterone to androgen. In summary, results of the present investigation demonstrate that increases in LH activity in the circulation act on two different steroidogenic glands to either enhance or reduce androgen biosynthesis. hCG stimulates luteal secretion of androstenedione and simultaneously inhibits placental production of this steroid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Osteocalcin, the vitamin K-dependent protein in bone containing gamma-carboxyglutamic acid, has been found to be significantly decreased in the osteomalacic bone of chicks made vitamin D deficient for 6 weeks. To evaluate whether this decrease in bone osteocalcin was due directly to the decrease or absence of vitamin D and its metabolites or to the secondary hypocalcemia and osteomalacia or other changes accompanying the deficiency of vitamin D, three experimental groups of Holtzman rats were studied. One group was made rachitic by a diet deficient in vitamin D, and the other groups were made rachitic by diets deficient in inorganic orthophosphate or calcium. The changes in bone and serum osteocalcin, serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3], and bone mineral content were evaluated, and morphological evaluation of bone was made. In the vitamin D-deficient animals, osteomalacia was evident histologically by 7 weeks, at which time serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 was not detectable, bone osteocalcin was decreased by 50%, and serum osteocalcin was decreased by 20%. In the animals fed a diet deficient in either calcium or inorganic orthophosphate but which were not depleted of vitamin D, the osteocalcin content of osteomalcic bone was normal, and an increase in the concentration of serum osteocalcin accompanied an increase in serum 1,25-(OH)2D3. These data are consistent with the conclusion that the metabolism of osteocalcin is affected by serum 1,25-(OH)2D3 and that the diminished level of osteocalcin in the bone of vitamin D-deficient animals is the result of a direct action of the metabolites and is not secondary to a decrease in the mineralization of bone tissue.\r"

In normal animals, the CRF+/AVP+ and CRF+/AVP- subpopulations were approximately equal in terms of detectable axonal swellings. Three to 14 days after adrenalectomy (ADX), the CRF+/AVP+ and CRF+/AVP- subpopulations represented about 95% and 5%, respectively, of total CRF+ swellings. This change was due to a 90% decrease in the absolute number of detectable CRF+/AVP- swellings after ADX, whereas the absolute number of detectable CRF+/AVP+ swellings rose by less than 20%. These changes were completely blocked by administering the glucocorticoid agonist dexamethasone throughout the period after ADX. The results suggest that the CRF+/AVP+ and CRF+/AVP- subpopulations of neurosecretory axons in the external zone of the median eminence respond differently to ADX, indicating that they are independently regulated by glucocorticoids.\r"

We investigated the occurrence of these three activities in a highly purified extract of the H-500 Leydig cell tumor which causes HHM when implanted into Fisher rats. PTH-like adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity (ACSA) was extracted from tumor tissue by sequential treatment with urea/HCl and ethanol/NaCl. Tumor extract was further purified by hydrophobic-interaction, gel-filtration, and reverse-phase HPLC steps to a specific activity of 1038 ng eq bPTH(1-34)/mg protein. Only the fraction pool containing ACSA demonstrated significant bone-resorbing (1.78-fold over basal) and transforming growth factor activity (epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent colony formation in soft agar suspension by NRK-49F indicator cells). A subsequent reverse-phase HPLC step produced material which contained both ACSA and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta)-like activity in a single fraction. Whether the responsible mediator in this animal model has TGF beta-like properties as well as PTH-like and bone-resorbing activity remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated Ca2+ mobilization induced by inositol compounds from intracellular stores of isolated porcine thyroid cells that were permeabilized with saponin and from fractionated thyroid microsomes that were preloaded with Ca2+. In the presence of saponin and antimycin A, a mitochondrial inhibitor, the Ca2+ concentration in the cell suspension decreased after the addition of ATP; the addition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) elicited transient elevations in Ca2+. The half-effective concentration (EC50) of IP3 was about 1 microM. TSH, acetylcholine, and norepinephrine had no effect on the Ca2+ movement, but phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) induced a similar Ca2+ release (EC50 = 3 microM). PIP2-induced release decreased as the Mg2+ concentration was raised. After the release induced by a maximal amount of IP3, PIP2 could induce a further Ca2+ release. We also measured Ca2+ efflux from fractionated microsomes preloaded with 45Ca2+ by ATP-dependent transport. IP3 induced a small efflux of 45Ca2+, but PIP2 was much more effective at low Mg2+ concentrations. More than half of the loaded 45Ca2+ was released by 10 microM PIP2 within 30 sec, and the EC50 was 0.7 microM. These results suggest that Ca2+ mobilization from the microsomes mediated by inositol compounds participates in the regulation of thyroid cell functions.\r"

However, the effects of long term administration of oCRF to fetal sheep have not been studied. We examined the effects of pulsatile administration of oCRF (1 microgram every 4 h) for 7 days on fetal pituitary and adrenal responses, as reflected by plasma concentrations of IR-ACTH and cortisol (F). In addition, we examined the effects of oCRF on cAMP accumulation by dispersed pituitary cells in vitro after treatment in vivo with either oCRF or saline. Pulsed oCRF (P-CRF) treatment resulted in a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in basal IR-ACTH and F concentrations on all days of treatment. However, the pituitary response (change in IR-ACTH in response to a pulse of oCRF) decreased, and the adrenal response (change in F in response to endogenously secreted ACTH) increased as treatment progressed. A significant inverse correlation (r = 0.962) between basal F and the IR-ACTH response to oCRF was seen over the 7 days of treatment. Although P-CRF treatment resulted in an increase in fetal adrenal weight, it did not lead to premature parturition. There was a dose-dependent accumulation of cAMP in response to oCRF in vitro by dispersed pituitary cells from both groups of fetuses. However, this response was significantly greater when the fetuses had been pretreated with oCRF in vivo than after saline treatment. We conclude that the P-CRF regimen employed in this study stimulates the fetal pituitary-adrenal axis and the ability of fetal pituitary cells to accumulate cAMP in response to further oCRF in vitro. The reduced plasma IR-ACTH response after continued P-CRF in vivo may be attributed to increasing negative feedback effects of elevated endogenous F.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of free calcium (Ca2+) on adenylate cyclase (AC) activity of rat anterior pituitary gland have been investigated in order to shed some light on the interrelationships between the two second messengers (cAMP and calcium) which operate in pituitary cells. Anterior pituitary homogenates or crude membranes preparations (obtained using buffers free of divalent cation chelators) were assayed and the concentrations of Ca2+ in the assay mixture containing EGTA were calculated by a computer program for each addition of CaCl2. A wide range of Ca2+ concentrations (from 2 X 10(-9) to 6 X 10(-4)M) was spanned. Ca2+ was found to markedly inhibit pituitary AC and the mathematical analysis of data indicated the presence of two inhibition The two KiS were: 1.78 +/- 0.48 X 10(-7) M and 2.47 +/- 0.52 X 10(-4) M for the homogenates and 1.71 +/- 0.45 X 10(-7) M and 3.15 +/- 0.85 X 10(-4) M for the membrane preparations. No stimulation of the enzyme could be detected at any Ca2+ concentration tested. Furthermore, because of our experimental conditions it is unlikely that there was substantial loss of endogenous calmodulin, or other calcium binding protein(s) required to mediate AC stimulation by calcium. The lack of a calcium-calmodulin stimulation of pituitary AC was confirmed by experiments with anticalmodulin drugs (trifluoperazine and calmidazolium, R24571) and experiments with EGTA-washed membranes in the presence of exogenous calmodulin. At any Ca2+ concentration, the same AC activity was observed in the presence and in the absence of anticalmodulin drugs or added calmodulin. The mechanism of pituitary AC inhibition by Ca2+ was investigated focusing on a range of Ca2+ concentrations near the Ki for the high affinity calcium site and thus similar to the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations. Ca2+ was found to act as a competitive inhibitor of the Mg2+ activation of AC and as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to the MgATP2-, the substrate of the enzyme. The effects of Ca2+ on AC were also studied in cell populations and tissues extremely rich in PRL-secreting cells (cell fractions purified from rat anterior pituitaries and human prolactinomas). The pattern of Ca2+ action was found to be nearly superimposable on that observed in total pituitary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The flow stopped in half of the rats at 25% of control blood pressure, but red blood cells were always present within the microvessels. In contrast, the topical application of 0.1 N HCl accelerated the decrease of blood flow with graded hypotension and caused progressive disappearance of the honeycomblike network of red blood cell-filled superficial mucosal microvessels. After retransfusion, mucosal bleeding occurred in the area in which the blood-filled microvessels had disappeared. Histology revealed that the bleeding extended from the middle of the depth of the mucosa and was associated with tissue necrosis. These results indicate that exogenous acid in hemorrhagic shock causes increased mucosal ischemia and tissue damage with bleeding on retransfusion.\r"

The following factors were studied: cause of cirrhosis; severity of cirrhosis; hepatocellular carcinoma recognized after inclusion; compliance; persistent decrease in heart rate; dose of propranolol; alcohol abstinence; previous history of hemorrhage; time interval from hemorrhage to onset of propranolol administration, and source of bleeding. The percentage of patients free of rebleeding was 71% at 1 year and 57% at 2 years. Only five factors were significantly and independently associated with rebleeding: occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma; lack of compliance; lack of persistent decrease in heart rate; lack of abstinence, and previous history of bleeding. In conclusion, this study confirms the results of our previous trial and suggests that certain factors play a role in the mechanism of rebleeding in patients receiving propranolol.\r"

Using two different assay systems, the effect of antigen-specific antibodies on the helper function of a HBsAg-reactive T cell clone was studied. The monoclonal antibody to HBsAg A5C3 (IgG) increased significantly the T cell-dependent production of immunoglobulins by Staphyloccocus aureus-stimulated autologous B lymphocytes. Furthermore, the results obtained with a different type of assay showed that A5C3 also increased the synthesis of antibody to HBsAg by the autologous B cells in the presence of HBsAg and the helper T cell clone. On the other hand, when the monoclonal antibody to HBsAg of IgM class, H5D3 or the F(ab')2 fragment of A5C3 were tested, no significant enhancement of the helper activity of the T cell clone was observed. Experiments performed in mice showed that the in vivo antibody to HBsAg response to low concentrations of HBsAg was significantly enhanced by mixing this antigen with monoclonal antibody to HBsAg of IgG class. No effect was observed when a monoclonal antibody to HBsAg of IgM class was used to prepare the immune-complexed immunogen. The results presented here suggest that antibodies play a critical role in their own production through regulating the activity of helper T cells. This phenomenon might contribute to the increased antibody synthesis of in vivo secondary immune responses and could be of use in designing more efficient vaccine programs in man.\r"

In this evaluation, patients readily learned information that prepared them to deal with postoperative experiences, that is, ambulation, exercise, resumption of sexual activity, and symptoms to report indicating lack of tolerance to such activities. Areas that showed limited knowledge gain were those that required long-term behavioral change, such as stress modification and dietary changes. These findings are particularly relevant when considered in the light of contemporary events in the payment environment. As lengths of stay decrease and acuity levels increase for hospitalized patients, inpatient teaching must be limited to what is possible and reasonable; that is, what is possible for the staff to teach during the short length of stay and what is reasonable for patients to learn given their acuity. This evaluation was conducted for decision-making purposes about a specific cardiac teaching program. Although the evaluation met the purposes of the evaluators, some of the findings suggested possible research hypotheses. A tightly controlled research study should be conducted using the knowledge acquisition test in clinical settings and accounting for such variables as educational level, years of coronary artery disease, severity of illness, and age. Further study could also be undertaken to validate the finding that hospitalized patients learned priority information necessary for adequate functioning immediately after discharge. With regard to patient confidence level and actual behavior change, a study could be conducted to determine if there is a relationship between patients' reported confidence at discharge and their subsequent behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Consequently, the relation between the sensitivity of individuals to complement activation by air bubbles and their susceptibility to decompression sickness has been examined. Plasma samples from 34 individuals were incubated with air bubbles, and the concentration of the fluid phase metabolites of complement activation C3a, C4a, and C5a were measured with radioimmunoassays. It was found that both the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a were produced by the presence of air bubbles but that the anaphylatoxin C4a was not. This finding indicates that air bubbles activate the complement system by the alternate pathway. One group of individuals was found to be particularly sensitive to complement activation by this pathway. They produced 3.3 times more C3a and 5.3 times more C5a in their plasma samples incubated with air bubbles as did the other group. Sixteen individuals were subjected to a series of pressure profiles that were severe enough to produce bubbles in their circulatory system that could be detected by Doppler ultrasonic monitoring. The group of individuals that had been identified as being more sensitive to complement activation by the alternate pathway was also found to be more susceptible to decompression sickness.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing's disease were tested with CRH before and 7-10 days and 3-6 months after selective transsphenoidal adenomectomy. In 28 of 30 patients an adenoma was found, and in 22 (79%) clinical and endocrinological remission occurred. Preoperatively, the majority of the patients had basal and CRH-stimulated plasma ACTH levels that were markedly increased compared to those in normal subjects. On the basis of the CRH stimulation test and low dose (2 mg) dexamethasone suppression test results 7-10 days after surgery, these 30 patients were divided into 4 groups. Groups I, II, and III were patients in remission, as defined by undetectable, subnormal, or normal basal plasma ACTH and cortisol levels in addition to sufficient suppression of cortisol (less than 2 micrograms/dL) during the low dose (2 mg) dexamethasone suppression test. Patients in group IV were not in remission. In group I (n = 6), CRH failed to raise undetectable basal ACTH levels in the early postoperative period; however, 3-6 months later plasma ACTH did increase in response to CRH. In group II (n = 11), undetectable or low basal ACTH levels increased after CRH, and the increase was similar to that in normal individuals. In group III (n = 5), basal ACTH levels were normal, and the response to CRH was exaggerated, but all patients responded normally to the dexamethasone suppression test. The CRH-induced ACTH increase in group III was significantly greater (P less than 0.003) than that in normal subjects, but was similar to that in patients not in remission in group IV (n = 6). Three to 6 months later, the ACTH response to CRH in group III was normal. In summary, the CRH test 7-10 days after surgery in patients with Cushing's disease indicated remission when there was no CRH-induced ACTH response or the response was normal (groups I and II). The test failed to predict remission in patients with an exaggerated CRH-induced ACTH response (groups III and IV). However, with regard to group II, the CRH-induced ACTH increase 1 week after selective adenomectomy indirectly supports the concept of CRH deficiency during hypercorticism and thus, in these patients as well as in group I, a pituitary origin of the disease.\r"

Eight normal subjects, four of whom had been protected with the sunscreen para-aminobenzoic acid (sun protection factor 8), were exposed to one minimal erythema dose of UV radiation. The mean serum vitamin D3 concentration increased from 1.5 +/- 1.0 (+/- SEM) to 25.6 +/- 6.7 ng/mL in unprotected subjects, whereas it was 5.6 +/- 3.0 and 4.4 +/- 2.4 ng/mL at these times in the subjects who were protected with para-aminobenzoic acid. Para-aminobenzoic acid also prevented the photoisomerization of 7-dehydrocholesterol to previtamin D3 in human skin slices in vitro. These results indicate that the sunscreen interferred with the cutaneous production of vitamin D3.\r"

At substrate concentrations at which native alpha 1-PI was readily degraded by macrophage elastase, oxidized alpha 1-PI was hardly degraded at all. Incubation of macrophage elastase with oxidized alpha 1-PI before the addition of native alpha 1-PI showed that oxidized alpha 1-PI was not an inhibitor of macrophage elastase. Competition experiments with up to twofold excess oxidized alpha 1-PI did not interfere with the degradation of native alpha 1-PI by macrophage elastase. Sequence analysis of amino acids in degraded native alpha 1-PI showed that macrophage elastase attacked a single peptide bond between Pro-357 and Met-358, the latter representing the P1 reactive-site residue of alpha 1-PI. In oxidized alpha 1-PI, Met-358 was converted to methionine sulfoxide and macrophage elastase hydrolyzed the bond between Phe-352 and Leu-353. These data suggest that methionine may be the primary cleavage site for macrophage elastase and not leucine, as previously thought.\r"

The human translated protein spans 381 residues and the amino acid homology with rabbit CK-B is greater than 98%. We have demonstrated that a nucleic acid probe encompassing the protein coding region will also hybridize to CK-M sequences while a probe derived from the 3' UT region is CK-B specific. When a B-isoenzyme specific sequence is hybridized to Eco RI cut genomic DNA, two independent restriction fragment polymorphisms are detected. We have subsequently localized these two CK-B homologous sequences to chromosomes 14q32 and 16. Finally, we show that increased levels of CK-B seen in SCLC are not accompanied by gene amplification or rearrangement, but reflect a greatly enhanced level of CK-B specific mRNA that is not seen in non-SCLC lines thus far examined.\r"

Three of the mAbs reacted with epitopes on the lipid A moiety, while a fourth recognized a determinant in the core oligosaccharide. The lipid A-specific mAbs cross-reacted with heterologous rough LPS and with lipid As released by acid hydrolysis of different intact (smooth) LPS. Carbohydrate groups in the O-side chain and core oligosaccharide of isolated, smooth LPS restricted antibody access to antigenic sites on lipid A. Yet, one lipid A-reactive mAb recognized its epitope on the surfaces of a variety of intact bacteria. These findings confirm the presence of highly conserved epitopes in the core-lipid A complex and prove the existence of human B cell clones with the potential for secreting high avidity IgM antibodies that react with these widely shared determinants. Such human mAbs might provide protective activity against disease caused by diverse gram-negative bacteria.\r"

We have studied 19 patients with severe recessive vWD (type III) and 19 with autosomal dominant vWD (type I) by Southern blotting with probes encompassing the full 9 kilobases (kb) of the vWF cDNA. Two apparently unrelated patients were shown to have large deletions within the vWF gene. Both patients had severe vWD (type III) and were the only patients among those studied that had inhibitory alloantibodies to vWF. The extent of deletion was similar in both patients, corresponding to at least the 3'-7.4 kb of the vWF cDNA. The deletion in each patient was estimated to exceed 110 kb. In addition, the localization of the vWF gene to chromosome 12 was confirmed, and a homologous sequence on chromosome 22 was identified.\r"

Percent narrowing and absolute cross-sectional luminal area were related through a quadratic function to myocardial perfusion reserve determined with PET. Arteriographically determined coronary flow reserve was linearly related to relative myocardial perfusion reserve as expected, based on the derivation of equations for stenosis flow reserve. All of the correlations had considerable scatter, indicating that no single measurement derived by coronary arteriography was a good indicator of perfusion reserve by PET in individual patients. This study provides the relation between all anatomic dimensions of coronary artery stenoses and myocardial perfusion reserve in man, and suggests that PET indicates the functional significance of coronary artery stenoses for clinical purposes.\r"

We observed that stimulation of the antigen receptor on a malignant human T cell line, Jurkat, led to substantial, sustained increases in Ins-1,4,5-P3 and InsP4. The Ins-1,4,5-P3 kinase partially purified from resting Jurkat cells had a maximum velocity (Vmax) of 0.09 nmol/min/mg protein and an apparent Michaelis constant (Km) of 0.2 microM. When the kinase was partially purified 10 min after stimulation of the antigen receptor or after the addition of phorbol myristate acetate, the Vmax was increased twofold. The activity of the Ins-1,4,5-P3 kinase obtained from either resting or stimulated Jurkat cells was enhanced in vitro by increasing the concentration of free Ca2+ from 0.1 to 0.5 microM.

Both OKT4+ and OKT8+ cells were seen infiltrating the tumor masses. In addition, in five cases, human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-DR was demonstrated on some tumor cells close to a vast number of HLA-DR+ infiltrates surrounding the carcinoma, but not on epidermal keratinocytes and tumor cells devoid of the HLA-DR+ infiltrates. A considerable number of OKT6+ dendritic cells were also observed surrounding the carcinoma. Staining with OKB7 and OKM1 revealed negligible reactive cells, and virtually none of the dermal infiltrates reacted with Leu-7 (HNK-1). These findings suggest that in addition to varied immunologically competent cells, expression of HLA-DR antigen on tumor cells may participate in a cellular immune reaction, a defense mechanism against tumor cell proliferation in basal cell carcinoma.\r"

The arterial-coronary sinus lactate difference was measured during electrophysiologic testing, before the induction of ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia was induced in 15 patients; it was sustained and unimorphic in 6 patients and polymorphic in 9. Myocardial ischemia, as reflected by net myocardial lactate production, was present within 60 seconds before the induction of ventricular tachycardia in 8 of the 15 patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia. In 9 of the 15 patients, programmed stimulation was repeated after a 15 minute rest period, with the same coupling intervals that had induced ventricular tachycardia previously. Net myocardial lactate production was not present in any patient during this repeat attempt. In three patients without evidence of ischemia during the first induction of ventricular tachycardia, the arrhythmia was induced again by the specific coupling intervals that had induced it previously. However, in five of six patients with net myocardial lactate production during the first induction of ventricular tachycardia, the same coupling intervals that had induced the arrhythmia in the presence of ischemia no longer induced it in the absence of ischemia. The results of this study suggest that myocardial ischemia may be a requirement for the induction of ventricular tachycardia in some patients with coronary artery disease who survive a cardiac arrest.\r"

Mechanisms for development of coronary stenoses proximal to the angioplasty site include: intimal injury by guiding catheters, guide wires, dilating balloons or combinations; or retrograde extension of the fibrocellular response to an adjacent proximal coronary segment. Histologic analysis of left main coronary arteries from 11 patients who died within 72 hours of angioplasty of the left coronary system disclosed focal loss of luminal endothelium in 9. This finding suggests that intimal injury from catheters or balloons, or both, proximal to the angioplasty site probably initiates a fibrocellular reaction. The amount of underlying atherosclerotic plaque in the injured proximal coronary segment determines the clinical significance of a subsequent fibrocellular response.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic and coronary hemodynamic, metabolic and humoral effects of a new intravenous angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, enalaprilat, were evaluated in 14 patients with chronic heart failure. Onset of hemodynamic action occurred within 15 minutes and persisted for 6 hours. At the time of peak effect, there was a significant reduction in mean arterial pressure (-21%) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (-33%). Systemic vascular resistance decreased by 32% and stroke volume index increased by 20%. These systemic hemodynamic changes indicate improved left ventricular function. There was a substantial sustained reduction in rate-pressure product initially without a change in coronary sinus blood flow or myocardial oxygen consumption. There was also reduced myocardial oxygen extraction and augmented coronary sinus oxygen saturation at 30 minutes and 1 hour. In three patients, abnormal myocardial lactate extraction, present before enalaprilat, changed to uptake after enalaprilat, indicating amelioration of myocardial ischemia that was not clinically manifest. Systemic catecholamine levels and myocardial catecholamine balance did not change. Plasma renin activity increased and plasma aldosterone decreased. These findings suggest that enalaprilat produces inhibition of the angiotensin-converting enzyme and consequent beneficial systemic hemodynamic changes in heart failure. In some patients with heart failure, silent myocardial ischemia at rest can occur and can be alleviated with enalaprilat. Decreased myocardial oxygen extraction, increased coronary sinus oxygen saturation and lack of expected decrease in coronary sinus blood flow despite reduced rate-pressure product suggest transient coronary vasodilation by enalaprilat.\r"

  ".W": "Muscle tone of coronary arteries is regulated by free calcium concentration in the myoplasm. Various agonists, autacoids and putative peptides modify the calcium concentration directly or through actions of second messengers (signal transductors), such as cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, diacylglycerol or calmodulin. For example, acetylcholine (in the presence of intact endothelium cells), alpha-human natriuretic peptide or nitrate compounds increase the amount of cyclic GMP and isoproterenol, prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) or vasoactive intestinal polypeptide increases cyclic AMP. Both cyclic nucleotides reduce free calcium concentration. On the other hand, acetylcholine (in the presence or absence of endothelium cells), norepinephrine or thromboxane A2 increases inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, thus causing the increase in the free calcium concentration, whereas vasoactive intestinal peptide and alpha-human natriuretic peptide reduce them. Calmodulin acts as an internal calcium receptor for regulation of the contractile machinary. Regulation of calcium homeostasis in relation to the muscle tone in the coronary arteries including other vascular tissues is discussed together with the role of second messengers.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-eight men aged less than or equal to 39 years had coronary bypass grafting during a 13 year period. Angina was the presenting symptom in 77% and of these patients, one-third had unstable angina. More than half of the patients had experienced at least one myocardial infarct. There was a high incidence of coronary risk factors, especially smoking. Nineteen patients (13.8%) had left main coronary artery stenosis (it was isolated in two); 13.8, 24.6 and 60.2% had single, double and triple vessel disease, respectively. Left ventriculograms showed serious functional impairment in 42%. A total of 461 coronary bypass grafts, 3.34 per patient, were placed; almost all were vein grafts. There were no operative deaths. Transmural myocardial infarction occurred in 4.3% of patients. All bypass grafts were opacified angiographically early after operation, 95% at 1 year, 56% at 5 years and 26% at 10 years after operation. Some patients also had coronary angiograms, dictated by clinical events, between 1 and 5 and between 5 and 10 years postoperatively. Patency rates for bypass grafts were comparable with those previously reported and were acceptable, although they decreased with time. However, increasing evidence of atherosclerosis of bypass grafts was seen beyond 1 year, particularly beyond 5 years. Of 23 subjects with a coronary bypass reoperation, 2 died and 44% had perioperative transmural myocardial infarction. During follow-up, 13.8% of the patients died, survival being 95, 84 and 76% at 5, 10 and 12 years, respectively. It is considered that the patients were advantageously treated with coronary bypass grafting especially in the short-term. However, bypass graft patency steadily decreased with the passage of time and graft atherosclerosis became an increasingly important problem.\r"

The leading portal of entry for the bacterium may have been the oral cavity; 4 days before the onset of his illness he had had extensive dental work. Immunological evaluation during the illness and in late convalescence (16 weeks after onset) revealed a persistent B cell abnormality characterized by markedly depressed in vitro secretion of immunoglobulins in response to pokeweed mitogen; however, serum immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses were normal. Abnormal numbers of suppressor T cells (OKT8+) and increased suppressor function were also present. Anaerobic pyogenic liver abscesses may occur in the absence of obvious underlying disease, but this case suggests that there may be an association with in vitro abnormalities of the immune system.\r"

Long-term T cell lines that recognize purified protein derivative, keyhole limpet hemocyanin, or Corynebacterium parvum were used in these studies. The ability of T cells from these lines to induce cytotoxic T lymphocyte or antibody responses were compared with their ability to proliferate or release interleukin 2 (IL 2). The results demonstrate that these T cell lines are able to react to soluble antigen by proliferation and IL 2 release. Moreover, the same cell lines are able to interact with CTLp or with the precursors of antibody-secreting B cells to induce a response. In the induction of CTLp we observed an inverse correlation between the number of TH cells required and the concentration of antigen used to pulse the antigen presenting cells. However the correlation between the ability of TH lines to proliferate specifically in response to antigen and to act as helpers for CTLp and B cells was not absolute as cells with compromised proliferative capacity were able to efficiently deliver inductive signals.\r"

Kinetic analysis of T191-mediated inhibition indicated that the antibody exerts its effect within 12 to 24 hr of the initiation of cultures and rapidly loses its activity thereafter. Small resting B cells are most sensitive to T191 inhibition, whereas B cells with increasing buoyant density (presumably reflecting stages of increased activation) become progressively T191 insensitive. Analysis of RNA synthesis subsequent to alpha IgM crosslinking of surface immunoglobulin demonstrated that T191 reduced [3H]uridine incorporation by up to 38% during the first 20 hr of culture. In contrast to the effects seen with alpha IgM stimulated B cells, T191 had no inhibitory effect upon phorbol myristate acetate-induced B cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect upon B cell proliferation observed with T191 is not unique among other alpha-T200 antibodies. Four of five previously described alpha-T200 monoclonal antibodies had similar inhibitory effects (82 to 57% maximum inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation). However, 13.3, an alpha-T200 monoclonal antibody previously shown to block natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing was without effect. Likewise, those antibodies capable of inhibiting B cell proliferation failed to block NK-mediated cytolysis. Antibody binding experiments together with proliferation inhibition studies suggest that all of the monoclonal antibodies tested recognized distinct epitopes on the T200 antigen. Both observations are of significance because they demonstrate that the effects seen with anti-T200 antibodies represent an interference with highly specific functional regions on the T200 molecules.\r"

T and B cell interactions in the in vitro anti-DNA antibody response of B/W mice were investigated, and two distinct families of helper T cells that drive these responses were defined. First, the anti-DNA antibody-forming cell (AFC) response was found to be increased in B/W mice with nephritis and was inhibited with the monoclonal antibody anti-L3T4, suggesting a major role for helper T cells. Purified splenic T cells from mice with nephritis were able to augment both the IgG and the IgM anti-DNA AFC response of young B/W B cells. T helper cells were cloned from spleens of NZB/W F female mice with high titer anti-DNA antibodies and nephritis. The cloned T cells augmented both IgG and IgM anti-DNA AFC responses of young B/W B cells. Four clones--27.9, 30.7, 30.8, and 30.10--were selected for further study. These cells proliferated, in the context of syngeneic (H2d/z) antigen-presenting cells (APC) but not to allogeneic APC. Analysis of the mechanism of T helper cell clone-mediated augmentation of anti-DNA AFC revealed two populations: \"cognate\" T helper cells, which specifically augment anti-DNA AFC (30.7 and 30.10), and non-antigen-specific T helper cells (27.9 and 30.8), which augment the response of B cells of differing specificity by a bystander mechanism, probably through increased release of B cell growth and differentiation factors.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured rat mesangial cells have features of immune effector cells that may contribute to the derangements in glomerulonephritis. Recent reports have demonstrated that mesangial cells produce a cytokine similar to interleukin 1 (IL 1). We predicted rat mesangial cells could express a gene homologous to murine macrophage IL 1. Mesangial cells were cultured by explant and were used in the fourth through sixth passages. Antibodies to desmin and fibronectin but not cytokeratin stained the cytoskeleton of all mesangial cells examined; no Ia+, leukocyte common antigen+ mononuclear phagocytes were present. RNA from mesangial cells and P388D macrophages hybridized in dot blots with a 32P-probe nick-translated from the murine IL 1 cDNA. Mesangial cells but not Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts contained IL 1 mRNA transcripts that co-migrated with the 2.0 kb message from murine P388D macrophages by Northern analysis of poly(A) RNA. In situ hybridization of cultured cells demonstrated specific hybridization of 3H-IL 1 probe to cells with the morphology of contractile mesangial cells and P388D cells but not 3T3 cells. IL 1 release is an important mediator of local inflammation and injury. Therefore we compared the expression of the IL 1 gene in total RNA from kidneys of rats with immune complex glomerulonephritis with that extracted from kidneys of healthy rats. Glomerulonephritic kidneys contain a twofold to threefold increase in IL 1 mRNA compared with normals. We conclude that rat mesangial cells express mRNA with significant homology to murine macrophage IL 1 mRNA and further suggest that local production of the potent phlogistic mediator IL 1 may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerulonephritis.\r"

  ".W": "We reported before that monosodium urate (MSU) crystals were potent stimulators of endogenous pyrogen (EP) production from human and rabbit mononuclear phagocytes, and proposed that this property of MSU crystals may be important in the pathogenesis of gout. EP activity is now attributed to interleukin 1 (IL 1) peptides but IL 1 is not the only pyrogenic monocyte-derived cytokine, since both interferon-alpha (alpha-IFN) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are also pyrogenic in rabbits. Using a T cell comitogenic assay based on a murine helper T cell clone that does not respond to IFN or TNF, we now report the release of IL 1 activity from human blood monocytes and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (MNC), following stimulation with MSU crystals. MSU-induced supernatants with IL 1 activity were neutralized with rabbit antiserum to human IL 1 and also stimulated the growth ([3H]thymidine incorporation) of long-term fibroblast-like cell lines derived from human synovial rheumatoid exudate. Two other crystals associated with articular inflammation were tested: hydroxyapatite was a much less potent stimulus compared with MSU crystals, and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate did not stimulate IL 1 release from human monocytes or synovial fluid MNC. As a model for the inflammatory consequences of acute and chronic overproduction of IL 1, gout is the only sterile inflammatory disease where the local and systemic pathology is compatible with such overproduction; raised IL 1 levels have been found at the site of inflammation, and a necessary etiologic agent, crystalline urate, has been shown unequivocally to be a direct activator of mononuclear IL 1 release.\r"

  ".W": "Rats injected with anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR)2 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) develop the acute phase of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis characterized by a macrophage inflammation of muscle endplates (EP). These animals are subsequently refractory to induction of a second such episode up to 8 wk after the initial injection. Analysis of this phenomenon to date has shown that mechanisms such as anti-idiotypic regulation, epitopic modulation, and cellular suppression or deletion are not significantly involved. In the present study, animals reinjected from 11 wk on developed a second episode of cellular EP inflammation. This renewed susceptibility correlated temporally with an increase in postsynaptic membrane length and AChR content. When the second injection of anti-AChR mAb was given at 8 wk, mAb bound to muscle EP caused a small reduction in AChR content in the absence of cellular inflammation. These observations suggested that total inaccessibility of AChR to mAb is not responsible for the refractoriness to cellular EP inflammation. More likely, a certain AChR concentration or density is necessary to bind a critical amount or density of antibody to activate complement and set in motion the events leading to a cellular inflammatory response. In human myasthenia gravis, in which initially damaged EP are continuously exposed to anti-AChR antibodies, this critical AChR concentration or density may not be reached again because of continuous complement-mediated lysis and/or increased AChR turnover. Hence, these data may explain the infrequency of cellular EP inflammation in motor point muscle biopsies in this disease.\r"

Unlike the parent D10.G4 cells, these KiSV-D10 cells can be maintained in vitro indefinitely in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL 2), and they all display a maximal proliferative response to purified or recombinant interleukin 1 (IL 1). The IL 1-induced proliferation is shown not to be dependent or secretion of the T cell autocrine growth factors IL 2 or B cell stimulatory factor-1 (BSF-1). The KiSV-D10 lines show certain differences from one another and parent D10.G4 cells in their secretory and proliferative responses to T cell receptor- and BSF-1 mediated signals.

  ".W": "The accessory function for T cell activation and the production of interleukin 1 (IL 1) of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cell lines were studied in vitro. ATL cell lines such as Hut-102, MT-1, and MT-2 functioned as accessory cells for the stimulation of human T cell proliferative response induced with concanavalin A (Con A) and induced allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction. Cell lysates of three ATL cell lines and the culture supernatant of MT-2 cells had activities to stimulate murine thymocyte proliferative response. Then we studied physicochemical properties of the factors produced by MT-2 cells. The m.w. of the factors were approximately 15,000 by Sephacryl S-200 column chromatography, and their isoelectric point values were 5.4 and 4.8 by chromatofocussing technique. No fraction contained interleukin 2 (IL 2) activities to stimulate IL 2-dependent murine cytotoxic T cell line. The thymocyte-stimulating activities of the factors were absorbed with rabbit anti-IL 1 alpha antiserum, but not with anti-IL 1 beta antiserum. Furthermore, messenger RNA extracted from MT-2 cells hybridized to complementary DNA of IL 1 alpha, but not of IL 1 beta, by Northern blot hybridization analysis. The factors from MT-2 cells could stimulate the production of IL 2 and the expression of IL 2 receptors of human T cells in the presence of Con A as well as recombinant IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta did, and these activities were also blocked by rabbit anti-IL 1 alpha antiserum, but not by anti-IL 1 beta antiserum. These results suggest that the factors produced by MT-2 cells correspond to IL 1 alpha. However, the accessory function of MT-2 cells for T cell activation was not blocked by rabbit anti-IL 1 antiserum. These results suggest that ATL cell lines produce IL 1-like factors, but the accessory function of ATL cell lines for T cell activation is mediated by some other mechanisms rather than by secreted IL 1-like factors.\r"

  ".W": "IL 1, a monocyte-derived cytokine, has potent biologic effects in a variety of target tissues. The existence of naturally occurring inhibitors of IL 1 activity has been recently described; these inhibitors blocked one IL 1 effect: stimulation of thymocyte responses to mitogens. We examined the effect of one well-characterized inhibitor of IL 1, isolated from the urine of febrile patients, on a second IL 1 effect, stimulation of fibroblast PGE synthesis. In this system, purified preparations of the urinary inhibitor that completely blocked murine thymocyte proliferative responses to mitogen failed to block PGE synthetic responses to IL 1. Rather, inhibitor preparations markedly enhanced fibroblast PGE synthetic responses to IL 1. When partially purified inhibitor preparations were fractionated by ion exchange chromatography, inhibitory activity for the IL 1 effect on thymocytes and PGE stimulatory activity co-eluted. Augmentation of the IL 1-induced PGE response was seen with both low (1:1 unit) and high (400:1) ratios of inhibitor to IL 1. Inhibitor preparations alone did not stimulate fibroblast PGE synthesis. The augmentation of fibroblast PGE synthesis by inhibitor preparations was not due to contaminating endotoxin. Active inhibitor preparations contained less than 15 pg of endotoxin/U activity, and the PGE stimulatory effect was not blocked by the addition of polymyxin B, whereas polymyxin B reversed the effects of exogenous endotoxin. It appears that the inhibition of IL 1 effects by naturally occurring inhibitors may have target cell and/or functional specificity.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin B (IL-B), a product of unstimulated B cells, is defined by its ability to selectively prevent the differentiation of suppressor T lymphocytes from precursors into effectors. The present study was undertaken to determine whether IL-B could also be active in modulating the activity of the T cell hybrid T2D4, which produces immunoglobulin-binding suppressor factors. T2D4 cells can be selectively induced by incubation with various isotypes of antibody to express isotype-specific Fc receptors and to release soluble factors that suppress production of the corresponding isotype. The data presented here demonstrate that IL-B is greatly effective in inhibiting T2D4 activities. Either pretreatment with IL-B or continuous exposure to IL-B prevents isotype activation of T2D4. As a result, T2D4 cells do not express isotype receptors and do not produce detectable amounts of isotype-specific suppressor factors. This IL-B regulatory activity on T2D4 is temperature dependent and is inhibited by cytochalasin B. These findings provide new insights on the mechanism by which IL-B enhances antibody responses, and they offer a conceptual framework for analyzing IL-B activity on suppressor T cells.\r"

We have previously reported that both transformed (PAM 212) and normal murine keratinocytes produce a soluble factor which induces proliferation of the T cell line, HT-2. In the present study we sought to compare keratinocyte-derived T cell growth factor (KTGF) with other T cell growth factors, characterize its physicochemical properties, and substantially purify KTGF from PAM 212 conditioned medium. KTGF from PAM 212 conditioned medium was not inhibited by antibodies which block the effect of interleukin 2 (IL 2) (S4B6) or B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF 1) (11B11). KTGF is heat-stable, has an isoelectric point of 4.8, and a relative molecular mass of 16 to 23 kilodaltons under nonreducing conditions. KTGF activity was enhanced at least 41,413-fold by sequential hydroxylapatite bulk preparation, desalting by reversed-phase chromatography, gel filtration high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), and reversed-phase HPLC. Keratinocytes produce a T cell growth factor with physicochemical properties distinct from IL 2 and BSF 1. KTGF may play a role in regulating the growth and differentiation of T cells in the epidermis.\r"

  ".U": "87196349\r", 
  ".W": "Recombinant human lymphotoxin (LT) was compared with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) for direct actions on cultured human endothelial cells (HEC). At equivalent half-maximal concentrations (based on L929 cytotoxicity units) LT and TNF each caused rapid and transient induction (peak 4 to 6 hr) of an antigen associated with leukocyte adhesion (detected by monoclonal antibody H4/18), a rapid but sustained increased expression (plateau 24 hr) of a lymphocyte adhesion structure (ICAM-1), a gradual (plateau 4 to 6 days) increase in expression of HLA-A,B antigens, and gradual (4 to 6 days) conversion of HEC culture morphology from epithelioid to fibroblastoid, an effect enhanced by immune interferon (IFN-gamma). Induction of H4/18 binding by maximal concentrations of LT or TNF could not be augmented by addition of the other cytokine, and 24 hr pretreatment with LT or TNF produced hyporesponsiveness to both mediators for reinduction. H4/18 binding can be transiently induced by tumor-promoting phorbol esters. Pretreatment with either LT or TNF also fully inhibited induction of H4/18 binding by phorbol ester, whereas phorbol ester pretreatment only variably and partially inhibited reinduction by LT or TNF. These actions of LT on endothelium shared with TNF may serve in vivo to promote lymphocyte and inflammatory leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration. Recombinant human interleukin 1 species (IL 1 alpha and IL 1 beta) shared many of the actions of LT and TNF and were indistinguishable from each other. However, IL 1 species could be distinguished from LT/TNF by their relative inability to enhance HLA-A,B expression, by their ability to augment H4/18 binding caused by maximally effective concentrations of LT or TNF, and by their inability to inhibit reinduction of H4/18 binding by LT or TNF. In contrast to the actions of LT or TNF, pretreatment with IL 1 alpha or IL 1 beta only partially inhibited induction of H4/18 binding by phorbol ester, and phorbol ester pretreatment consistently, albeit partially, inhibited induction by IL 1 species. These studies suggest that activated T cells through the secretion of LT can in turn activate the local endothelial lining so as to promote homing and extravasation of inflammatory cells. Furthermore, these LT actions can be augmented or complemented by other locally produced mediators such as IFN-gamma or IL 1.\r"

  ".W": "By using human calcitonin (hCT), human calcitonin-gene-related peptide (hCGRP), and a synthetic peptide with a sequence analogous to the 34 C-terminal amino acids of human preprocalcitonin (designated as PQN-34) as haptens in the generation of monoclonal antibodies, we assessed the role of amido and amino groups in paratope-epitope binding. By using peptide inhibition experiments and solid-phase immunoassays, monoclonal anti-hCT antibody CT07 and monoclonal anti-hCGRP antibody CGR01 were found to bind to an antigenic determinant located in the C-terminal segment of the hormones. These epitopes comprise the seven C-terminal amino acids of the hormones, and the presence of the hormone-ending carboxamide group was found to be essential for antibody binding. The corresponding heptapeptides, either bearing a carboxyl group or else linked to a glycine residue at their C-terminal part, failed to react with the antibodies. Moreover, these monoclonal antibodies did not bind to synthetic peptides analogous to the C-terminal region of the hormone precursor molecules that comprised the epitope site flanked by a peptide sequence. In an attempt to assess whether amido groups when present on the side-chain of amino acids may also modulate antibody binding, a monoclonal antibody referred to as QPO1 was produced and was found to recognize an antigenic determinant localized in the N-terminal region of the PQN-34 peptide bearing a glutamine residue as the N-terminal amino acid. The epitope was found to correspond to a topographic assembled site, and binding of QPO1 was found to be substantially dependent on the presence of the free amino and the side-chain amido groups borne by the N-terminal glutamine residue of this peptide PQN-34. In contrast to these findings, an antigenic determinant located in the internal sequence of calcitonin and recognized by monoclonal anti-hCT antibody CT08 was found to be expressed on the mature form of the hormone, as well as on synthetic peptides with sequence mimicking that of preprocalcitonin. These data should guide the choice of synthetic peptide haptens for the production of anti-protein antibodies.\r"

The monoclonal antibody bound all of the 60,000, 30,000, and 15,000 dalton IgE binding factors from two T cell hybridomas and those from activated T cells of a normal individual. The antibody bound both IgE-potentiating factors, which had affinity for lentil lectin, and IgE-suppressive factors, which had affinity for peanut agglutinin. However, the monoclonal anti-IgE-binding factor bound neither Fc epsilon R on RPMI 8866 cells nor IgE binding factors from the B lymphoblastoid cells. A monoclonal antibody against Fc epsilon R on B cells (H107) bound the 60,000 and 30,000 dalton IgE binding factors from both T cell hybridomas and RPMI 8866 cells but did not bind the 15,000 dalton IgE binding factors from either T cells or B cells. The results indicate that T cell-derived IgE binding factors have a unique antigenic determinant that is lacking in both Fc epsilon R on B cells and B cell-derived IgE binding factors. The anti-IgE binding factor and anti-Fc epsilon R monoclonal antibodies both failed to stain cell surface components of IgE binding factor-producing T cell hybridomas. However, both antibodies induced the T cell hybridoma to form IgE binding factors. The results suggest that the T cell hybridomas bear low numbers of Fc epsilon R that share antigenic determinants with IgE binding factors secreted from the cells.\r"

  ".W": "Planar lipid membranes containing the purified Ia molecule E beta k:E alpha k can present a peptide antigen derived from cytochrome c to the T cell hybridoma 2B4.11. The incorporation of E beta k:E alpha k into planar membranes was linear over a 120-fold range of Ia molecule concentrations, permitting the dependence of the T cell response on the Ia molecule concentration to be examined. As the Ia molecule concentration was increased in the planar membranes, two parameters changed: less antigen was needed to stimulate the T cells, and the plateau response seen at functionally saturating concentrations of antigen increased. The antigen sensitivity was analyzed by plotting the antigen concentration (log2) required to stimulate the release of 10 U of IL 2 from the T cells as a function of the Ia molecule concentration (log2). If the T cell recognized a simple unit of one antigen molecule and one Ia molecule, this plot should have generated a straight line with a slope of -1. Surprisingly, a line with a slope of -2.04 X/divided by 1.12 was observed, suggesting that the T cell might recognize one antigen molecule and two Ia molecules. This complexity, however, resulted from changes in the maximal response achieved at different Ia molecule concentrations. A similar phenomenon was observed when the Ia molecule concentration was decreased in cultures containing splenic antigen-presenting cells (APC) by the addition of an anti-E beta k:E alpha k monoclonal antibody, or the use of [B10.A(4R) X B10.PL]F1APC. The Ia molecule concentration can therefore be limiting for T cell hybridomas in cultures containing normal APC and functionally saturating amounts of antigen. When the planar membrane data were normalized to the maximal response to eliminate the effect of the changing plateau response, the resulting plot generated a line with a slope of -1.17 X/divided by 1.11. These results suggest that the sole stimulatory signal for this T cell hybridoma consisted of a 1:1 ratio of antigen and Ia molecules.\r"

No anti-HBs was detected in control groups of mice immunized with other rabbit anti-Id-KLH preparations. The anti-HBs containing sera from mice immunized with the Ab-2 alpha were able to inhibit the Id-anti-Id reaction, indicating that an Id-positive, anti-HBs response was induced. This idiotype is not normally expressed during the murine immune response to HBsAg and suggests that noninternal image anti-Id activates silent clones. This study, along with our previous results obtained with the use of internal image anti-Id, suggests that there is more than one Id network operational during the BALB/c murine immune response to HBsAg.\r"

Concanavalin A-stimulated in vitro proliferative responses of splenocytes were examined after infection of BALB/cByJ mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) or Sendai virus. Mice were exposed to these viruses by presumed natural routes (per os or intranasally). Immunodepression was marked but transient among BALB/cByJ mice exposed to MHV-JHM. Among mice exposed to Sendai virus and examined over a 21-day period, spleen cells from only one mouse, sacrificed 10 days postinoculation, exhibited a severely impaired ability to respond to concanavalin A. Lymphokine production by spleen cells from control and infected mice was then assessed. IL 2 was either absent or present at very low levels in culture supernates of concanavalin A-unresponsive spleen cells from MHV-JHM-infected mice. Spleen cells from the single Sendai virus-infected mouse also produced very low levels of IL 2. In contrast, IL 1 was detected in supernatants of all spleen cell cultures derived from control, MHV-JHM-infected, or Sendai virus-infected mice. There was not a clear correlation between concanavalin A responsiveness and the ability of spleen cells to produce interferon-gamma. These results stress the importance of using laboratory mice of known microbiological status for immunologic experiments.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined characteristics of chlamydia-stimulated mouse B cells as well as cells that regulate polyclonal responses in vitro. B lymphocyte proliferation stimulated by chlamydia arises at a similar time as Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proliferative responses during ontogeny. In contrast, development of immunoglobulin (Ig)-secreting cells after chlamydia stimulation is delayed by several weeks relative to ontogeny of LPS-inducible plaque-forming cells (PFC). The lack of Ig secretion by immature B cells is not due to a deficiency of Lyb5+ B lymphocytes, since X-linked immunodeficient (xid) NBF1 mice that lack this B lymphocyte population respond well to chlamydia stimulation. Adherent cells are important for chlamydia-stimulated B lymphocyte differentiation, but are not as necessary for their proliferation. Neither adult adherent cells nor T cells can correct the inability of immature spleen cells to develop into Ig-secreting cells; spleen cells from 2-wk-old mice (i.e., immature B cells) will not suppress adult B lymphocyte responses to chlamydia. When B lymphocytes are separated according to their buoyant densities, chlamydia stimulates low density (activated) B cells to proliferate and differentiate better than high density (resting) cells. Proliferative responses to chlamydia arise earlier during ontogeny, do not require adherent cells, and can proceed to a relatively greater extent in resting B cell population (compared with activated B cells) than induction of Ig-secreting cells.\r"

We produced Thy-1 negative variants of the murine T cell lymphoma EL-4 by mutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS), negative selection with anti-Thy-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) plus complement, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Thy-1 surface negative (Thy-1-) mutants produced in this manner were shown to produce no detectable Thy-1 mRNA, but contained an intact Thy-1 gene as determined by Southern blotting. 5' CG sequences, which had been demethylated in the parent EL-4 clone, were completely methylated in the EMS-induced Thy-1-variant. In addition, a DNase I hypersensitive site that mapped to the 5' end of the Thy-1 gene in EL-4 was absent in the Thy-1- variant. Treatment of this Thy-1- clone with 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-dAZA) resulted in re-expression of surface Thy-1, demethylation of the 5' CG sequences, and regeneration of the DNase I hypersensitive site. These studies indicate that methylation of certain critical DNA sequences in the 5' region of the Thy-1 gene can alter local chromatin structure and regulate expression of this gene.\r"

MB3.6, a murine monoclonal antibody directed against the GD3 ganglioside, induced high levels of ADCC. This ADCC was mediated predominantly, if not completely, by human killer cells (large granular lymphocytes) whereas other effector cell populations demonstrated no significant cytotoxic activity in 6- or 18-hr assays. The IgG2a an anti-melanoma antibody 9.2.27 generated low or no ADCC with most normal donors or melanoma patients. IL 2 was a very potent booster of ADCC activity. Interferon alpha also was effective, whereas interferon gamma did not augment but rather inhibited reactivity. We tested a large panel of antibodies of various isotype against colon carcinoma cells and found that gamma-3 isotype antibodies more frequently generated ADCC and produced higher levels of cytotoxic activity than did IgG1 or IgG2 antibodies. It appears that a variety of parameters can affect ADCC reactions, including the type of effector cell and its level of activation, the isotype of the antibody, and properties of the target cell line such as its susceptibility to lysis.\r"

P1 antigen was undetectable also in bone marrow macrophages, indicating a different cytolytic mechanism of these cells.\r"

CTL were generated both in vitro and in vivo to the H-2b and H-2d haplotypes. The specificity of the CTL was verified by using EL-4 (H-2b) and P815 (H-2d) target cells in a 51Cr-release assay. The cytolytic effect of the CTL on mouse blastocysts was measured by assessing blastocoel retention and inhibition of [3H]thymidine incorporation by the embryos. It was shown that CTL kill blastocyst stage embryos from C57BL/6J (H-2b) and B10.D2 (H-2d) mice with the zona pellucida removed, but not with the zona pellucida intact. These results demonstrate that the H-2 antigens present on mouse blastocysts can be recognized by CTL. It is suggested that one biologic role for the zona pellucida is the prevention of cell-mediated destruction of preimplantation embryos in utero.\r"

Intravenous administration of nBSA to BDF1 mice substantially suppressed the antibody response to subsequent immunization with either nBSA or cBSA, whereas pretreatment with cBSA by the same route significantly enhanced the responses to both antigens. The functional properties of BSA-specific T and B cells from mice immunized with cBSA or nBSA were examined in reconstitution experiments in which splenic T populations together with B cells were transferred into irradiated syngeneic recipients. Transfer of splenic T cells from mice primed with nBSA caused profound suppression of the response to subsequent immunization with nBSA or cBSA, whereas transfer of either B or T cells from cBSA treated mice produced an enhanced response to both antigens. C57BL/6 mice, which are considered to be low responders to BSA, produced a significant antibody response to BSA when immunized with cBSA. In contrast, immunization with nBSA did not produce measureable amounts of antibody in mice of this strain. Our data clearly demonstrate that cationized BSA exhibits unique immunogenic properties due to alterations in the self-regulation of the immune response.\r"

Our previous studies demonstrated that B cell proliferation is suppressed in these mice by a cascade of interactions involving macrophages and soluble factors. The present report pinpoints the G1 phase of the cell cycle as the stage of B cell proliferation inhibited in PC-mice. Modulation of surface immunoglobulin (sIg) with anti-mu, an early membrane activation event, occurred normally on B cells from the spleens of PC-mice. However, examination of the size profile and the expression of sIgD and sIgM on B cells from the spleens of PC-mice showed an accumulation of large-sized, low intensity sIgD+ cells, suggesting a block in B cell activation in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle. This was confirmed by experiments in vitro that demonstrated that although LPS-stimulated B cells from the spleens of PC-mice enlarged to a size characteristic of G1 phase, most did not additionally enlarge into S phase even after 3 days of culture, nor did they incorporate significant amounts of [3H]thymidine. Additional confirmation of a block in late G1 was obtained by using analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation, cell size, and cell cycle after normal cells were cultured in supernatants from cloned PC lines containing the factor(s) that initiates the cascade of events leading to suppression of B cell proliferation. The relevance of these findings to PC-induced immunosuppression and to the regulation of normal B cell proliferation during the G1 phase of the cell cycle is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Two methods to bursectomize chick embryos before hemopoietic cell seeding of the bursa of Fabricius were compared in this work: section of the tail region at E3 including the presumptive bursal territory, and selective removal of the bursa at E5. Hatching ability is better with the former method, but survival rate and effectiveness of bursectomy are favored with the second, novel technique. Moreover, selective removal of the bursa at E5 can be followed by in situ engraftment of a quail bursa and construction of quail-chick bursal chimeras. The immune response of bursaless birds and bursal chimeras has been studied. Total absence of the bursa does not prevent a few B cells from differentiating and nonspecific Ig (IgM and/or IgG) from being secreted. As reported previously, bursaless birds, however, are unable to mount an immune response by producing specific antibodies. This immune function is restored by the graft of a quail bursa. The microenvironment of the bursa, although heterospecific, allows the expansion of the B cell population and generates the repertoire of the B cell antigen receptors. This process takes place during late embryonic and early postnatal life because the grafted quail bursal stroma is subjected to immune rejection from 2 to 3 wk after birth in all chimeras, which are, however, perfectly immunocompetent.\r"

By three independent assays (lymphokine secretion, T cell proliferation, and B cell differentiation), TNP-RGG was presented at 10(2)- to 10(3)-fold lower concentrations than RGG, and RAMG at 10(2)- to 10(3)-fold lower concentrations than TNP-RGG. The available data suggest that the efficiency of antigen presentation is dependent primarily on the avidity of binding of a ligand to B cell surface Ig and/or the extent of subsequent endocytosis (modulation). Despite the observed quantitative differences between anti-Ig (RAMG) and specific antigen (TNP-RGG), these results demonstrate that qualitatively both are essentially similar in their ability to mediate specific T-B interactions. Thus, anti-Ig antibodies are valid models for analyzing cognate interactions between antigen-specific B and helper T lymphocytes.\r"

In the absence of IL 1, the IL 1 receptor appears to turnover with a t1/2 of approximately 11 hr. However, when cells are incubated in the presence of IL 1, the IL 1 receptor undergoes extensive ligand-induced down-regulation. IL 1 itself is internalized at 37 degrees C; 50% of the surface-bound IL 1 is internalized in 60 to 120 min. IL 1 does not undergo degradation for at least 6 hr after internalization. By using electron microscopy and autoradiography, we observed several important features of the internalization process. When cells having bound 125I-IL 1 at 4 degrees C were shifted to 37 degrees C, IL 1 moved from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm where it was found in proximity to nuclei or within lysosomes. IL 1 appeared to progressively accumulate in nuclei. Six hours after shifting cells to 37 degrees C, 30 to 35% of the internalized 125I-IL 1 is associated with the cell nucleus. The accumulation of relatively high levels of IL 1 in the nucleus raises the interesting possibility that IL 1 may not only interact in a highly specific manner with cell surface receptors, but also with potentially important nuclear receptors.\r"

The purification involved sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography, gel filtration, and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The purified protein has a m.w. of 16,000 in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and an isoelectric point between 7.0 and 8.0. The relative molecular mass 16,000 form exists in equilibrium with dimeric and tetrameric forms. aBGF supports the growth of EBV-transformed B cells, which have been deprived of their own conditioned medium. The purified aBGF is fully effective at 0.5 ng/ml and has no interleukin 1 activity in the lymphocyte activation factor assay. Because several randomly selected lines of EBV-transformed cells and one EBV-negative lymphoma cell line both produce aBGF activity and show growth dependency on aBGF and because stimulation of normal B cells with anti-immunoglobulin M is increased by aBGF, we propose that aBGF has general significance for growth control of human B cells.\r"

Anti-CR1 antibodies similarly enhanced the anti-fluorescein antibody response. Enhancement only occurred in cultures performed in the presence of the relevant antigen. No enhancing effect on the anti-TNP response was observed on addition to cultures of monoclonal antibodies directed against other surface antigens of B cells or an anti-T cell antibody of the same subclass as that of anti-CR1 antibodies. Anti-CR1 antibodies alone did not induce nonspecific B cell proliferation and did not provide B cells with a first signal for proliferation in the presence of a source of B cell growth factors. Anti-CR1 antibodies did not enhance the nonspecific proliferative response of B cells to growth factors derived from PHA-stimulated T cells, semi-purified BCGF 20 KD, BCGF 50 KD, or recombinant IL 2 in the presence of anti-mu. In this respect, the effect of anti-CR1 antibodies differs from that of anti-CR2 antibodies which interact with early stages of B cell activation. In contrast, anti-CR1 antibodies enhanced specific differentiation of antigen-activated B cells in the absence of T cells when soluble T cell factors were provided. Similar results were obtained by using either of two sources of differentiation factors, the MLA-144 supernatant or a 30 to 15 KD fraction from PHA-stimulated T cells. These results indicate that triggering of CR1 on B cells positively regulates the specific antibody response to low doses of antigen by enhancing B cell differentiation whether T cell help is provided by intact T cells or by T cell-derived differentiation factors.\r"

In these experiments we have investigated the effect of AF on the binding of phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) to human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. AF enhanced binding of PDBu to its receptor in CLL cells by a) causing an increase in the affinity of PDBu receptors from Kd 20.3 nM to 7.3 nM, and b) enhancing translocation of PDBu receptors to the cell membrane. The increase in PDBu binding induced by AF in whole cells was only partially reversible by EGTA or the intracellular Ca++ antagonist TMB-8. Studies performed with quin-2-labeled cells showed that 100 microM AF caused a mean (+/- SD) rise in cytosolic Ca++ levels from 0.41 (0.12) to 0.85 (0.33) (n = 5). Thus the mechanism by which AF increases binding of PDBu to its receptor appears to be partially dependent on Ca++. These effects of AF occurred at cellular levels achieved in mononuclear cells during chrysotherapy of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.\r"

First, macrophage viability after infection with VSV was measured by washing to remove dead cells, staining the remaining cells with crystal violet, and reading absorbance. Second, a yield reduction assay was used to measure viral replication in the macrophage cultures. Cells treated with CSF-1 (500 to 2000 U/ml) and infected with VSV looked similar microscopically to uninfected cells and had absorbance values twofold to threefold higher than those of infected cultures not treated with CSF-1. The CSF-1-treated cultures also had a virus titer one log lower than that of the untreated cultures. Treatment with partially purified murine CSF-1 induced a similar reduction in virus titer, whereas other murine CSF tested (purified murine GM-CSF, lung-conditioned medium that contains GM-CSF and G-CSF, and WEHI-3B-conditioned medium as a source of IL 3) had little to no effect on virus titer. Antibody to murine IFN-alpha/beta added to the macrophage cultures inhibited the protective effect of CSF-1, indicating that the CSF-1 effect was due to induction of endogenous IFN. Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (1 ng/ml) had some protective effect, which was blocked with polymyxin B. Polymyxin B did not inhibit the effect of CSF-1.\r"

In order to purify this monokine, a continuous cell line was sought as a generator of source material. It was found that high titers of an ECEF-like activity could be obtained from the U937 cell line cultured in serum-free medium. Production of this activity was optimal when cells were cultured with PMA for 2 days and were further treated with LPS for 2 days. PMA and LPS alone did not enhance eosinophil cytotoxicity and could be separated completely from U937-ECEF activity by reversed-phase HPLC. Thus, the activity was not due to carry-over of these two stimuli. U937-ECEF was compared with M-ECEF by a number of analytical methods. ECEF from both sources was resistant to several denaturing treatments but was sensitive to proteases or to reduction and alkylation. U937-ECEF exhibited activity profiles similar, if not identical, to those of M-ECEF when subjected to molecular sizing HPLC in the presence of 8 M urea, isoelectric focusing, and reversed-phase HPLC. The activity has apparent m.w. of 17,000 and 32,000, isoelectric points ranging from 3.8 to 5.1, and one or more reversed-phase HPLC retention times, depending on the method of sample preparation. These results demonstrate certain physical characteristics of M-ECEF, show that the U937 cell line is an appropriate source for the purification of M-ECEF, and provide information that will allow the design of a purification strategy. Although it appears that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or a TNF-like molecule is a component of M-ECEF, a major component of M-ECEF is different from TNF as judged by the 1) physical characteristics of M-ECEF, 2) low direct toxicity of M-ECEF to L929 cells, 3) comparative stability of M-ECEF to heat treatment, and 4) inability of an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody to remove M-ECEF activity.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the possibility of heterogeneous mechanisms in the proliferation of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) cells, leukemic cells from 13 patients, nine acute-type and four chronic-type ATL, were examined for the production of interleukin 2 (IL 2) with or without mitogenic stimulation and their response to recombinant IL 2 when exogeneously added. The leukemic cells were classified into four groups, as follows. Group 1 (two patients): Cells of this group produced IL 2 messenger RNA, secreted IL 2, and proliferated when cultured in mitogen-free medium. The spontaneous proliferation of the cells in mitogen-free medium was inhibited by anti-Tac/IL 2 receptor and anti-IL 2 monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, the thymidine incorporation by the cells was enhanced in response to exogeneously added recombinant IL 2 and IL 2 produced by themselves. These results indicate that the ATL cells of this group proliferate with autostimulation by IL 2. Group 2 (seven patients): Cells of this group did not secrete IL 2 when cultured in mitogen-free medium, but the cells showed response to exogeneously added recombinant IL 2 and proliferated in culture. These results indicate that the ATL cells of this group proliferate by a paracrine mechanism. Group 3 (one patient): Cells of this group secreted IL 2 in mitogen-free medium. However, the spontaneous proliferation of these cells in vitro was very low, and the response to recombinant IL 2 was also very low. Group 4 (three patients): Cells of this group did not secrete IL 2 in mitogen-free medium. Spontaneous proliferation and the response to recombinant IL 2 were also very low. The clinical feature of all patients of Groups 1 and 2 was acute-type, and that of Groups 3 and 4 was chronic-type. Thus, we conclude that heterogeneous mechanisms exist in the proliferation of leukemic cells, and that growth rate in mitogen-free medium and response to IL 2 of the cells may have a significant relationship to the clinical feature, acute- or chronic-type.\r"

However, a careful study of the changes in numbers of cell surface molecules during B cell differentiation has not been undertaken. We have addressed this question by using an inducible B cell lymphoma, CH12. Scatchard analysis was used to quantitate the levels of expression of surface immunoglobulin, major histocompatibility complex-encoded class I and class II molecules, and Ly-1 molecules on these cells during their differentiation in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that the density of most molecules on the initial population of CH12 cells was comparable to their densities on small splenic B cells. Upon culture, we could classify the molecules into two groups based on their change in expression. One group, represented by surface immunoglobulin and class II molecules, decreased (surface immunoglobulin) or did not change (class II) in number after LPS stimulation, but increased during culture in the absence of LPS. The second set, represented by class I and Ly-1 molecules, increased after LPS stimulation, but did not change as a result of culture. Although the characteristic behavior of class I and class II molecules was different, concomitant changes were observed in both class I (K and D) molecules, and in both class II (I-A and I-E) molecules.\r"

  ".W": "In the majority of patients, allergic nickel contact dermatitis is associated with a proliferative response of peripheral blood T lymphocytes to nickel sulfate. Optimal proliferation was found in a concentration range of 1-2 X 10(-4) M nickel sulfate. Nickel-specific response of purified peripheral blood T cells requires the presence of antigen-presenting cells (APC). Both peripheral blood monocytes and skin-derived epidermal cells could function as APC, but epidermal cells were shown to be more potent than monocytes. By testing FcR+ monocytes and FcR- circulating dendritic cells for their antigen-presenting capacities, it was found that the critical APC within the fraction of monocytes is the circulating dendritic cell. Testing highly purified T6+ (CD 1) skin-specific dendritic cells (Langerhans cells, LC) and T6- epidermal cells as APC, the critical APC within the fraction of epidermal cells appeared to be the LC. The crucial role of LC was stressed in experiments using T cells from patients exhibiting a positive patch test to nickel but a low or absent proliferative response to nickel by unpurified peripheral blood cells. Whereas addition of peripheral blood APC was ineffective, addition of LC to purified peripheral T cells was shown to overcome this low responsiveness to nickel. These results indicate the crucial role of dendritic APC subsets in nickel-specific T-cell proliferation.\r"

In the present study, the exact immunophenotypes of lymphocyte subpopulations with their localizations in normal human skin were determined quantitatively. B cells were not found to be present in normal human skin. Lymphocytes were always of T-cell type, and 90% of these T cells were clustered in 1-3 rows around postcapillary venules of the papillary vascular plexus or adjacent to cutaneous appendages. In such perivascular localizations, they were found to differ from their circulating counterparts in three ways. First, skin perivascular cells were found to be approximately evenly distributed over CD4+ inducer and CD8+ suppressor-cytotoxic T-cell subsets (mean CD4/CD8 ratio: papillary layer 0.96, reticular layer 0.99). Second, within the category of CD4+ inducer T cells, most were phenotyped as CD4+, 4B4+ helper inducer T lymphocytes, whereas CD4+, 2H4+ suppressor inducer T lymphocytes were found to be relatively rare (less than 5%). Third, the majority of skin perivascular T cells were activated as they expressed HLA-DR and interleukin 2 receptors. Intraepidermal, directly subepidermal, and other (\"free\") lymphocytes were mostly of the CD8+ suppressor-cytotoxic T-cell subset but accounted for less than 10% of the total number of lymphocytes. Intraepidermally localized T cells accounted for less than 2% of the total number of lymphocytes present in normal skin. Our results indicate that preferential perivascular localization of activated T lymphocytes is the characteristic of normal human skin. This might be a reflection of continuous antigen recognition upon endothelial cell presentation and/or continuous T cell-mediated endothelial cell activation thereby inducing enhanced antigen clearing by the skin's endothelium.\r"

All isolates were identified as Ad35 by using genomic analysis with the restriction endonuclease SmaI, but many viruses exhibited other group B hemagglutinins, a property of the fiber protein. Further analysis of DNAs from 40 of these isolates, mapped by using the enzymes BamHI, HpaI, and PstI, revealed a total of 14 genomic variants from the Ad35 prototype. Seven of these genomic types, with either Ad7 or Ad11 hemagglutinin, had corresponding restriction site differences within the fiber gene, a result consistent with recombination events with other group B adenoviruses.\r"

In each supernatant, interleukin-2 (IL-2) produced by T helper cells (positive for Lyt 1.2 or OKT4) was necessary to provide reconstitution. Supernatants from neonatal mice failed to mediate reconstitution because of an age-dependent absence of production of IL-2. Although supernatants from neonatal human cell cultures contained IL-2, they failed to reconstitute production of antibody to HSV and resistance to HSV infection because of a suppressor of IL-2 activity. Early antibody production and antibody-dependent cellular effector function are important defenses against HSV infection and are critically defective in the neonate.\r"

Cells infected with these recombinants synthesized at least one protein (precursor, mature form, or both) that was precipitated with monoclonal antibody to HSV type-common determinants on gD. These determinants were detected on the surface of cells infected with the recombinants at 2 hr after infection. VP176 immunization protected against primary (P much less than .001) and recurrent (P much less than .001) cutaneous HSV type 2 lesions and ganglionic latency (62% protection). VP221 immunization protected against recurrent disease (P less than .05), although HSV type 2 ganglionic infection was established. Protection, first observed at two weeks after immunization, apparently did not involve HSV-specific neutralizing antibody because seroconversion was detected at 35-45 days after immunization. Protection was correlated with HSV-specific lymphoproliferation and the elaboration of lymphokines that enhance natural killer cell cytolysis.\r"

We studied the role of various platelet pathways involved in the As-VWF-induced platelet aggregation. We used prostacyclin, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, forskolin, 5'-p-fluorosulfonyl adenosine, apyrase, aspirin, and EDTA to evaluate the role of adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane synthesis, and the effects of calcium on the binding of As-VWF to platelets and ensuing aggregation. We found that agents that increase intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate totally inhibit As-VWF-induced platelet aggregation but only partially inhibit the As-VWF binding to the GPllb-llla complex. The endoperoxide-thromboxane pathway does not play a major role in either As-VWF binding to platelets or induction of platelet aggregation. As-VWF binding to the GPllb-llla complex appears to be approximately 70% to 80% ADP dependent and approximately 20% to 30% ADP independent. The binding of As-VWF to the GPllb-llla complex appears to be different from the binding of intact VWF or fibrinogen to the GPllb-llla complex with the platelet agonists ADP or thrombin.\r"

One patient with multiple vascular occlusions suffered a stroke at the time of surgery. Follow-up studies showed an increase of regional cerebral blood flow in only two of the twelve patients. In the group as a whole, there was no significant change of cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption or fractional oxygen extraction after bypass surgery. The most consistent post-operative change, observed in eleven of the twelve patients, was a fall of cerebral blood volume in the cortical territory of the bypassed carotid artery (p less than 0.01). This effect was most marked in patients with bilateral carotid occlusion, in whom there was often an accompanying fall of blood volume in the contralateral hemisphere. The post-operative findings were consistent with an increase of regional cerebral perfusion pressure as a result of the bypass procedure. Although this effect is potentially of value, those patients with most to gain from bypass surgery may also run the highest risk of peri-operative cerebral ischaemia.\r"

Nine of 11 patients displayed completely identical patterns between leukemic episodes, while two of 11 patients demonstrated genetic progression between diagnosis and relapse as evidenced by additional rearrangements. These genetic changes marked the emergence of leukemic subclones. Ig gene rearrangements were also used as sensitive markers to identify clonal cell populations in ALL patients following induction or reinduction therapy and to search for residual bone marrow disease in patients in clinical remission or with isolated extramedullary relapse.

Fifty-four percent (15 of 28) were positive predominantly for T4 (helper T cell) and 46% (13/28) for T8 (suppressor T cell). The median age of the patients was 57 years. They usually presented with advanced disease, and while extranodal involvement was common, CNS disease was not seen. The IBL-like type was associated with a positive Coombs' test and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Five of the nine pleomorphic type were checked for antibody to HTLV-I virus and all were negative. PTCL was associated with poor prognosis, which was not influenced by the histologic subtypes and the T4/T8 phenotypes. The complete response rate of 13 consecutive patients who received the BACOP (bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone) L17M regimen was significantly better than the 16 historic controls who received other less-intensive regiments, 84% v 19% (P less than .01). The relapse rate was also significantly lower, 9% v 100% (P less than .001). There appeared to be an improvement in the disease-free survival (DFS) (80% v 0% at 18 months), as well as the overall survival (60% v 36% at 18 months), but the differences did not reach statistical significance due to small sample sizes.\r"

  ".W": "Immunotoxins are hybrid molecules which combine the exquisite selectivity of monoclonal antibodies with the potent toxicity of protein toxins. An immunotoxin was constructed by linking a murine monoclonal antibody against the human transferrin receptor (TR) to the plant toxin, ricin. The cytotoxic activity of the anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin was tested in vitro and demonstrated highly potent and cell type-specific killing of cells derived from human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma, and leukemia. The anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin killed more than 50% of \"target\" cells at a concentration of 5.6 X 10(-13) M after an 18-hour incubation with the ionophore, monensin. This potency exceeds that of any other anti-TR immunotoxin reported in the literature. When the activity of the anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin against \"target\" tumor-derived cells was compared with the immunotoxin's activity against \"non-target\" cells, it could be predicted that a selective toxicity of anti-TR-ricin immunotoxin between tumor cells and normal brain was more than 150- to 1380-fold. Solid-phase indirect radioimmunoassay techniques were used to demonstrate significantly higher levels of TR in the glioblastoma- and medulloblastoma-derived cell lines, as well as in surgical tissue samples of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma, as compared to normal brain. Immunotoxins targeted to the TR may possess sufficient specificity to be of therapeutic importance, particularly to treat neoplastic disease of the central nervous system involving compartments (such as intrathecal, intraventricular, or cystic) where delivery of immunotoxins to tumor would not require transvascular transport.\r"

Thirteen of 18 aneurysm patients were found to have CIC on admission as compared to three of 21 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.001). The presence of CIC in aneurysm patients was associated with a poor prognosis. Eight of nine patients who developed angiographic vasospasm had CIC on admission compared with one of four without vasospasm. Patients with vasospasm showed a twofold increase in plasma C3d levels at the time when the spasm occurred, whereas no significant changes in the C3d concentration could be demonstrated in aneurysm patients without spasm or in patients with hematoma unrelated to aneurysm rupture. These findings suggest that immunological processes involving complement-activating immune complexes are involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm following rupture of saccular aneurysms.\r"

This binding was at a concentration of Gd sufficient to detect the implanted cells and to distinguish them from the surrounding brain tissue with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla. These Gd-labeled immunoglobulin preparations did not bind bovine T cells at a concentration sufficient to be detected on MRI. A protein solution containing the immunoglobulins (100 micrograms), gelatin (2 mg), and bovine serum albumin (2.5 mg) was reacted with the dianhydride of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA); the DTPA serves as a metal chelator and as a protein crosslinking agent. The DTPA-protein complex was reacted with Gd chloride. There were approximately 10 DTPA residues per protein molecule in the modified protein mixture. Isolated human or bovine monocytes (approximately 12 million cells) were implanted in the brains of anesthetized dogs in a volume of 40 microliters. The blood-brain barrier was then disrupted by the intra-arterial injection of hyperosmotic mannitol, and the Gd-labeled antibodies were injected through a catheter placed at the branch of the internal and external carotid arteries. The brains were imaged 48 to 72 hours later. The MRI scans revealed a markedly decreased T1 relaxation time with a high signal intensity (TE = 25 msec, TR = 200 msec) related to the human T cell implants. There was no evidence of decreased T1 at the site of the bovine T cells. Neither control murine gamma globulin coupled to Gd-DTPA nor anti-human T cell antibodies uncoupled to Gd modified the MRI contrast of the human T cells in the brain.\r"

Data analysis strategies which therefore purport to quantify cerebral metabolism per unit mass brain tissue are in fact measuring a value which may be artifactually reduced due to contamination by CSF. We studied cerebral glucose metabolism (CMRglc) in 17 healthy elderly individuals and 24 patients with Alzheimer's dementia using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and PET. All subjects underwent x-ray computed tomography (XCT) scanning at the time of their PET study. The XCT scans were analyzed volumetrically, in order to determine relative areas for ventricles, sulci, and brain tissue. Global CMRglc was calculated before and after correction for contamination by CSF (cerebral atrophy). A greater increase in global CMRglc after atrophy correction was seen in demented individuals compared with elderly controls (16.9% versus 9.0%, p less than 0.0005). Additional preliminary data suggest that volumetric analysis of proton-NMR images may prove superior to analysis of XCT data in quantifying the degree of atrophy. Appropriate corrections for atrophy should be employed if current PET scanners are to accurately measure actual brain tissue metabolism in various pathologic states.\r"

Studies of dogs with experimental GI bleeding have indicated bleeding rates of 0.05 ml/min can be detected with [99mTc]sulfur colloid. Since similar data in the dog model were unavailable for 99mTc-labeled red blood cells, we undertook this study. To simulate lower GI bleeding, catheters were inserted into the bowel lumen. Each dog's blood was labeled with 99mTc using an in vitro technique. Venous blood was then withdrawn and re-infused into the lumen of the bowel using a Harvard pump. Fourteen dogs were studied, ten receiving a bleeding rate from 4.6-0.02 ml/min in the descending colon and four with proximal jejunal bleeds of 0.20-0.02 ml/min. Bleeding rates of 4.6-0.2 ml/min were detected within 10 min in the colon and bleeding rates as low as 0.04 ml/min were seen by 55 min. Slower bleeding rates were not detected. Similar findings were noted for proximal jejunal bleeds. Based on the time of appearance, a minimum volume of approximately 2-3 ml labeled blood was necessary to detect bleeding. We conclude that 99mTc-labeled RBCs are sensitive for low bleeding rates in the dog model. The rates are comparable to those described for [99mTc]sulfur colloid in this experimental setting. The time of appearance of activity is related to the bleeding rate.\r"

Scatter from the emission source into the transmission window is removed by subtracting the predicted scatter distribution. The transmission image is then reconstructed to yield the map of attenuation coefficients for anatomic display or attenuation correction purposes. Experimental work has shown that the method can accurately derive mu values to +/- 2.5% in both phantom and patient studies, without increasing acquisition time. Preliminary attenuation correction experiments have demonstrated an accuracy of better than 5% for estimated activity.\r"

This is an adaptation of the deoxyglucose method, with the addition of a second injection of FDG immediately after completion of the first scan, then followed 30 min later by a second scan. A model has been developed to allow for correction of measured tracer concentration in the second scan by subtracting the predicted remnant from the first scan. The possible applications of this method in studying behavior-metabolism relationships are demonstrated. The preliminary results show 6%-12% changes in rCMRglc values for appropriate brain regions when the behavioral state is altered, but show 0%-5% change in rCMRglc values when the behavioral state is unchanged. The method can contribute significantly to the understanding of behavior-metabolism relationships by allowing the noninvasive study of two behavioral states in a single PET procedure.\r"

  ".W": "In a tumor cell line of the mouse anterior pituitary (AtT-20/D16-16) consisting of a homogeneous population of corticotrophs, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) activates adenylate cyclase and cAMP-dependent protein kinase. In addition, CRF induces a rise in cytosolic calcium levels in AtT-20/D16-16 cells and stimulates adrenocorticotropin hormone release. To determine whether activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is essential for CRF to stimulate calcium mobilization and trigger adrenocorticotropin hormone release, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase was inserted into AtT-20/D16-16 cells using a liposome technique. In control cells, CRF, forskolin (a direct activator of adenylate cyclase) and potassium increased cytosolic calcium levels. Insertion of the protein kinase inhibitor into AtT-20/D16-16 cells greatly attenuated CRF and forskolin-stimulated calcium mobilization although it did not alter the rise in cytosolic calcium induced by potassium. Treatment of the cells with liposomes lacking protein kinase inhibitor (but containing an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin) had no effect upon the calcium mobilization elicited by any of the agents tested. These results reveal an essential role for cAMP-dependent protein kinase in mediating CRF-stimulated calcium mobilization and suggest that its activation may be an essential molecular event for CRF to evoke adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion.\r"

  ".W": "There are pronounced interindividual differences in the neurotoxicity of theophylline in humans as reflected by the wide range of plasma theophylline concentrations associated with the occurrence of life-threatening, generalized seizures in patients treated with this widely used bronchodilator. The variability indicates that there may be a number of as yet unrecognized risk factors for theophylline neurotoxicity. After the development of an animal model of theophylline-induced seizures, renal failure was identified as one such risk factor. This investigation was designed to determine if experimental liver disease will alter the neurotoxic effect of theophylline. Studies were performed on rats with extrahepatic cholestasis produced by bile duct ligation and with hepatic necrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride administration and on respective controls. Theophylline was infused i.v. at 1.03 mg/min until the onset of maximal seizures. Theophylline and theophylline metabolite concentrations at that time were determined in serum (unbound and total drug), brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Extrahepatic cholestasis was associated with small increases in unbound theophylline concentration in serum, theophylline concentration in brain and serum free fraction in serum at onset of seizures. The concentrations of theophylline metabolites were negligible. There were no apparent effects of extrahepatic cholestasis or hepatic necrosis on theophylline concentrations at onset of seizures in cerebrospinal fluid, the fluid that was shown in a preceding study to be the best indicator of the theophylline concentration at the site of the neurotoxic effect. It is concluded that experimental liver disease had no apparent effect on the neurotoxicity of theophylline under the conditions of this investigation.\r"

Infusion of 1 microM acetylcholine normally elicited vasoconstriction. However, acetylcholine (3.0 nM-1.0 microM) produced concentration-dependent vasodilatation when administered to lungs in which pulmonary artery pressure (i.e., perfusion pressure) was elevated and cyclooxygenase activity was blocked, respectively, by infusing the endoperoxide analog U46619 (2.0-10.0 nM) and 30.0 microM indomethacin. Three additional groups of lungs treated with indomethacin and preconstricted with U46619 were challenged twice with 1.0 microM acetylcholine. Two of the groups were equilibrated with an infusion of either 20.0 microM quinacrine or 10.0 microM ferrous hemoglobin before and during their second challenges with acetylcholine and a control group received no treatment between trials. Neither quinacrine nor hemoglobin altered base-line pulmonary artery pressure, but both agents reversed the effect of acetylcholine from vasodilatation to vasoconstriction. This study agrees with previous reports of a pulmonary vasoconstrictor action of acetylcholine dependent on an intact cyclooxygenase pathway, but also provides new evidence for a vasodilator action of acetylcholine in the intact lungs of rabbits. Quinacrine and hemoglobin are known to antagonize the endothelium-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle elicited by acetylcholine; therefore, this study provides indirect evidence supporting a role for the endothelium-derived relaxing factor in the regulation of pulmonary vascular tone.\r"

Inasmuch as CGRP-like immunoreactive nerves were demonstrated to be present in the rat vas deferens, the effect of CGRP on the contractile activity of the tissue was pharmacologically and electrophysiologically analyzed in vitro. The twitch response of the vas deferens induced by transmural nerve stimulation was inhibited by rat CGRP, porcine CGRP and human CGRP (hCGRP). Both ED50 values and the extent of the maximum inhibition of the twitch response were the same for these CGRP groups. hCGRP (10(-8) to 10(-7) M) hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential of smooth muscle cells but did not affect the amplitude of excitatory junction potentials induced by nerve stimulation. Neither the frequency of occurrence nor the amplitude of spontaneous junction potentials were affected by hCGRP. The threshold potentials for the generation of action potentials were less negative in the presence of hCGRP. hCGRP reduced slightly the contraction of the tissue induced by norepinephrine and by adenosine 5'-triphosphate. hCGRP reduced markedly the contractions induced by direct electrical stimulation of both denervated and normal tissues in the presence of tetrodotoxin. These results indicate that CGRP does not affect the release of a sympathetic neurotransmitter. CGRP appears to attenuate the contraction of the rat vas deferens through suppression of both the excitability and excitation-contraction coupling of the smooth muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The discovery that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) causes parkinsonism in humans and other primates by selective destruction of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons has spurred research to define the mechanisms underlying its toxicity. To avoid variables such as tissue distribution, extracerebral metabolism and blood-brain barrier permeability, the authors studied the neurochemical and morphologic effects of direct perinigral infusions of various concentrations of MPTP, its metabolites and analogs in the rat. MPTP, in the highest dose used, 1000 nmol, decreased dopamine and its metabolites in ipsilateral striatum by approximately 75%, whereas 3,3-dimethyl-MPTP (which is oxidized to 1,3,3-trimethyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium cation but not to a pyridinium species) had no effect. The 2,2 and 3,3-dimethyl analogs of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium cation which also cannot be oxidized to pyridinium species, reduced striatal dopamine, suggesting that these compounds are toxic in their own right. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium cation (MPP+) and its 4-(4-fluorophenyl) and 4-(2-pyridyl) analogs that have less negative reduction potentials than MPP+, were most potent in decreasing striatal dopamine and metabolites, with MPP+ being 5 to 10 times more effective than its two analogs and approximately 100 times more potent than MPTP and the two dimethyl 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium cation analogs. These findings suggest that MPP+ is ultimately responsible for MPTP toxicity but does not act via oxidant stress mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "pH-dependent effects of 100 microM streptomycin and various aminoglycosides were examined at frog (Rana pipiens pipiens) sciatic sartorii in vitro by using the intracellular microelectrode recording technique. pH-dependent effects of streptomycin were also examined on indirectly elicited (nerve-stimulated) and directly elicited sartorius muscle twitches in vitro. Furthermore, in vivo effects of systemic pH alterations on neomycin-induced mortality were examined in Sprague-Dawley rats. There was a direct correlation between aminoglycoside potency and the number of basic groups per drug molecule (r = 0.95). At pH 7.2 and 9.0, the effect of pH on aminoglycoside potency correlated inversely with the pKa of the aminoglycoside (r = -0.98). At 0.7 and 2.2 pH units below 7.2, however, aminoglycoside-induced inhibitions of quantal content, end-plate potential amplitude and the indirectly elicited muscle twitch were potentiated by a pH-dependent mechanism that was independent of the pKa of the aminoglycoside. At these pH values, qualitatively similar drug effects were not observed on miniature end-plate potential amplitude and frequency or the directly elicited muscle twitch. Potentiation of aminoglycoside action was observed on mortality of rats, however, when the pH was 0.1 pH unit below 7.4. Thus, potentiation of aminoglycoside-induced neuromuscular blockade by protons in vitro and in vivo was demonstrated and appears to involve the pH-dependent activity of a prejunctional membrane component that regulates voltage-dependent, Ca++-mediated transmitter release.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody-vinca alkaloid conjugate, KS1/4-DAVLB (LY256787), and free 4-desacetylvinblastine (DAVLB) were administered i.v. to male athymic nude mice bearing P3/UCLA human lung adenocarcinoma tumors. Although the plasma pharmacokinetics were similar between LY256787 and DAVLB (terminal plasma half-lives of 62 and 83 hr, respectively), substantial differences in the volumes of distribution and initial redistribution-elimination phases were found. Uptake of LY256787 into tumor was apparent, with maximal radioequivalent concentrations measured 96 hr after dosing; no similar uptake was found after dosing with free DAVLB. The ratios of concentrations of drug radioequivalents in tumor to those in other tissues were generally greater than 1.0 when measured 24 to 48 hr after dosing with LY256787 but were less than 1.0 after free DAVLB. These data support the concept of site-specific delivery to the tumor tissue of the vinca alkaloid by the antibody. Plasma pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution were compared in males and females with a lower dose of LY256787. No sex-related differences in the plasma pharmacokinetics were found (terminal half-lives of 90 and 84 hr in males and females). Some sex-related biodistribution differences occurred. In all studies, the primary route of elimination was fecal. These studies suggest that the KS1/4 monoclonal antibody targets DAVLB to the P3/UCLA human lung adenocarcinoma in vivo in the human xenograft model and that an increased therapeutic index may be achieved with LY256787 over conventional free drug therapy.\r"

Each patient underwent laparoscopy as part of her infertility evaluation. The ability of T cells to form rosettes with sheep erythrocytes was used to estimate the percentage of total and active T cells. B lymphocytes were quantitated by erythrocyte antibody complement binding capacity. In addition, T and B lymphocytes were assayed with the Immunobead technique using specific monoclonal antibodies. The helper T cell (T4) and suppressor T cell (T8) subsets of lymphocytes were evaluated with specific monoclonal antibodies coupled to microbeads. The results demonstrated an increased number of T and B cells in peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood from patients with endometriosis as compared with controls. Furthermore, the ratio T4:T8 was significantly increased in patients with endometriosis. These results suggest a cell-mediated immune response in the presence of endometriosis.\r"

In order to determine the reliability of the device and the pathology of the lesions caused by the short duration (0.5-1.0 msec), and high intensity (60-375 psi) pressure wave, laboratory rats were exposed to the pressure waves generated by the machine. The animals were divided into three groups: the first exposed to midthoracic blasts, the second to abdominal blasts, and a group of controls exposed to a gentle stream of gas. Group I showed gross and microscopic evidence of lung blast injury of \"rib imprint\" hemorrhages, intra-alveolar hemorrhage, marked increase in lung weight, prolonged apnea, and bradycardia. Group II showed typical blunt abdominal trauma at the closest ranges, but characteristic submucosal hemorrhages up to 4.0 cm from the blast nozzle. In both groups, a protective effect was seen in heavier animals. The blast wave generator permits reproducible blast injury in the laboratory that is safer and faster than current methods. The lung and bowel lesions induced are grossly and microscopically similar to injuries of blast exposure seen in clinical patients.\r"

Forty percent of homosexuals compared with 0.19% of the general population were seropositive for HIV, and sexual contact with US homosexual men and prior history of gonorrhea were major risk factors. The seroprevalence of HIV was three times higher than that for HTLV-I, suggesting that HIV is more efficiently transmitted, especially since HIV appears to have been recently introduced into Trinidad.

There were no significant differences in the prevalence of antibodies to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A and B viruses, herpes simplex virus, syphilis, and toxoplasmosis among the African and US patients with AIDS, African heterosexual controls, and US homosexual men. However, these four groups all demonstrated a significantly greater prevalence of antibodies to each of these infectious agents compared with US heterosexual men. Immunologic studies demonstrated a significant elevation of activated lymphocytes (HLA-DR and T3 positive) and immune complexes in both AIDS populations and African heterosexual and US homosexual populations, compared with the US heterosexual population. These data demonstrate that the immune systems of African heterosexuals, similar to those of US homosexual men, are in a chronically activated state associated with chronic viral and parasitic antigenic exposure, which may cause them to be particularly susceptible to HIV infection or disease progression.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the ultrastructural and metabolic changes occurring in the hypertrophied ventricle during cardiac operations in man, we studied 36 patients with valvular heart disease undergoing valve replacement, during which multiple doses of cold potassium cardioplegic solution were administered (Group I). Each patient had substantial ventricular hypertrophy according to measurements made of left ventricular mass, with a mean of 232.1 +/- 19.8 gm/m2 (normal: 92 +/- 16 gm/m2). Serial biopsy specimens were obtained from the left ventricular apex at the initiation of bypass, during the cross-clamp interval, and during reperfusion. Each specimen was scored from 0 to 4 according to ischemic changes in nuclear chromatin, mitochondrial swelling, myofibrillar edema, glycogen depletion, and overall cell morphology. Myocardial pH and temperature were measured continuously in the left ventricular free wall. During the cross-clamp period, ischemic injury was evidenced by changes in nuclear chromatin (0.38 +/- 0.10 to 1.25 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.0001), intracellular edema (0.43 +/- 0.06 to 0.97 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.002), overall cell morphology (0.37 +/- 0.06 to 0.97 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.001), and mitochondria (0.10 +/- 0.05 to 0.19 +/- 0.07, p less than 0.0001). During reperfusion, mitochondrial swelling increased further (0.19 +/- 0.07 to 0.35 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.0001) and glycogen stores were depleted (0.63 +/- 0.13 to 0.96 +/- 0.17, p less than 0.02), while the other structures remained unchanged. Myocardial pH declined during ischemic arrest from 6.89 +/- 0.04 to 6.40 +/- 0.04 (p less than 0.001). The changes in myocardial pH in Group I were compared to changes in myocardial pH in 10 patients (Group II) with no left ventricular hypertrophy undergoing isolated coronary bypass graft operations with the same protective techniques. In contrast to Group I, myocardial pH did not fall in Group II during ischemic arrest (6.98 +/- 0.06 to 6.94 +/- 0.05, p = not significant). Thus, with the use of current myocardial protective techniques, ultrastructural and metabolic changes indicative of ischemia are produced in the hypertrophied myocardium. The structural alterations consist of changes in nuclear chromatin and intracellular edema during the ischemic phase and by mitochondrial swelling during reperfusion.\r"

Patients were subdivided into cohorts on the basis of the year of reoperation: Group A (1967 to 1978, 436 patients); Group B (1979 to 1981, 439 patients); and Group C (1982 to 1984, 625 patients). Overall operative mortality was 3.4% (51 deaths): 4.6%, 2.3%, and 3.4% for Groups A, B, and C, respectively. Group C had significantly more women (p = 0.01) and patients with triple-vessel disease, left main coronary artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 50%), abnormal left ventricular function, age greater than or equal to 70 years, and graft failure as a surgical indication (all p less than 0.001). The mean interval between operations increased from 50 months for Group A to 84 months for Group C. At reoperation, Group C patients received more grafts, more internal mammary artery grafts, and had a higher prevalence of complete revascularization (all p less than 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified left main stenosis (p less than 0.0001), Class III or IV symptoms (p = 0.0002), advanced age (p = 0.0006), Group A (p = 0.02), and incomplete revascularization (p = 0.004) as predictors of increased in-hospital mortality. Follow-up of in-hospital survivors (mean interval 54 months, range 13 to 171 months) documented a 5 year survival rate of 90% and a 10 year survival rate of 75%. Multivariate testing identified advanced age (p less than 0.0001), hypertension (p less than 0.0001), and abnormal left ventricular function (p less than 0.0001) as predictors of decreased late survival.\r"

The concentration of terminal complement complex increased significantly only in the group undergoing extracorporeal circulation, with a corresponding drop in the number of granulocytes. In contrast, the C3dg concentration increased during both extracorporeal circulation and abdominal aneurysmectomy, which indicates that other factors than extracorporeal circulation may affect C3 activation during major operations. In the thoracotomy group, where the most pronounced increase in granulocytes was found, no complement activation was recorded. It is concluded that extracorporeal circulation activates the terminal pathway of complement and that assays detecting activation of both the initial and the terminal parts should be included when the pathophysiology of complement is examined during major operations and extracorporeal circulation.\r"

  ".W": "At present, only the autogenous saphenous vein is acceptable in aorta-coronary bypass grafting. We developed a small-caliber vascular graft and evaluated the potential application for aorta-coronary bypass grafting. Canine carotid arteries were cross-linked with polyepoxy compounds, such as polyglycerol polyglycidyl ether, which is a new cross-linking reagent, and then heparinized by our own method. The polyepoxy compound-cross-linked graft can keep the natural vessel compliance and is stronger than the glutaraldehyde-cross-linked graft; thus, it provides excellent suturability and compliance match. Heparin was gradually released from the graft wall, and thrombus formation was completely prevented during the period before development of the endothelial lining. As a pilot study, the grafts, 2 to 3 mm in internal diameter and 5 to 7 cm in length, were evaluated as bilateral carotid replacements in five dogs. All grafts were patent at intervals of 14 to 177 days. Histologic examinations showed excellent antithrombogenic and healing characteristics, although the endothelialization was delayed by heparin, which inhibits cell adhesion and fibrin deposition. The 3 mm internal diameter graft was evaluated as an aorta-coronary bypass grafting model in eight dogs. Flow within grafts to the right coronary artery ranged from 25 to 35 ml/min, and flow in the circumflex or left anterior descending grafts ranged from 75 to 100 ml/min. Cineangiography was performed to confirm graft patency. Three dogs died of viral infection and one was killed. At necropsy, the grafts remained patent without thrombi along the graft length. Four dogs were allowed to survive for long-term evaluation. All grafts were patent at time intervals to 21 to 113 days with 100% patency. These results led us to conclude that our newly developed small-caliber vascular graft shows great promise in application for aorta-coronary bypass grafting.\r"

Control of local osseous disease was successful using radiation therapy in 100% of those cases with follow-up. Surgical curettage of bone lesions was successful in a small number of cases. Chemotherapy alone or in combination with radiation appeared to enhance survival in patients with recurrent disease or multisystem involvement.

Before treatment, lymphoblasts were tested for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies to B-cell, T-cell, and myeloid (My) antigens. Unexpectedly, myeloid antigens (MCS-2 or MY9) were identified in 25 patients (33 percent), usually in conjunction with B-cell or T-cell antigens. Among My+ patients, 15 (60 percent) expressed B-cell antigens (B+T-My+); all 6 tested had rearranged immunoglobulin genes. Five patients (20 percent) expressed T-cell antigens (B-T+My+), and one My+ patient expressed both B-cell and T-cell antigens. Only myeloid antigens (B-T-My+) were expressed in four patients (16 percent); three who were tested had germ-line immunoglobulin and T-cell-receptor gene configurations. Although no significant differences in presenting clinical features were found, My+ patients had fewer complete remissions than My- patients (35 vs. 76 percent, P less than 0.01). No differences in response or survival were observed between My+ and My- patients expressing T-cell antigens. However, among those expressing B-cell antigens, My+ patients had fewer complete remissions (29 vs. 71 percent, P = 0.02) and shorter survival (P = 0.03; median, 8.1 vs. greater than 26 months). These findings indicate that expression of myeloid antigen identifies a high-risk group of patients with adult ALL for whom alternative forms of treatment should be investigated.\r"

The procedure was technically successful in 133 patients (79 percent). In the follow-up period, nine of the 133 patients died (five of cardiac disease), and actuarial cardiac survival was 96 percent at six years. All patients were symptomatic before angioplasty, but 67 percent of the 133 who had technically successful procedures were asymptomatic at the last follow-up evaluation. Exercise stress testing, positive in 97 percent before angioplasty, was positive at the last follow-up study in only 10 percent of the patients who had technically successful procedures. Stenosis recurred during the first six months in 30 percent of the patients, and six more recurrences were observed among the 41 patients who had follow-up angiograms at two to seven years. A second angioplasty was required in 27 patients, and coronary bypass surgery was subsequently needed in 19. Actuarial event-free survival (freedom from death, myocardial infarction, and coronary bypass surgery) was 79 percent at six years. Follow-up of patients with multivessel disease showed a higher mortality from cardiac causes and a lower rate of long-term success than occurred among patients with single-vessel disease. These long-term results indicate that most episodes of restenosis occurred within six months of angioplasty, but some late recurrences were seen. Patients with single-vessel disease had a better long-term outcome after angioplasty than those with multivessel disease.\r"

Basal evening concentrations of ACTH and cortisol, but not of lactate, were elevated in highly trained runners as compared with sedentary subjects and moderately trained runners. Exercise-stimulated ACTH, cortisol, and lactate responses were similar in all groups and were proportional to the exercise intensity employed. These responses, however, were attenuated in the trained subjects when plotted against applied absolute workload. Only the highly trained group had diminished responses of ACTH and cortisol to ovine corticotropin-releasing hormone, consistent with sustained hypercortisolism. We conclude that physical conditioning is associated with a reduction in pituitary-adrenal activation in response to a given workload. Alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis consistent with mild hypercortisolism and similar to findings in depression and anorexia nervosa were found only in highly trained runners. Whether these alterations represent an adaptive change to the daily stress of strenuous exercise or a marker of a specific personality profile in highly trained athletes is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "During the past 25 years, three forms of deficiency of the inhibitor of the first component of complement (C1 inhibitor) with angioedema have been recognized; two forms are hereditary and one is acquired. As compared with hereditary angioedema, the syndrome of acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency is rare, and it is usually associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. We report another type of acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency with angioedema. Two patients with recurrent angioedema but no associated diseases were found to have IgG1 autoantibodies against C1 inhibitor. The anti-C1-inhibitor antibodies prevented binding of C1 inhibitor to activated C1s. Both patients had 60 to 70 percent of normal levels of C1 inhibitor, but it was functionally inactive, with a molecular weight of 96,000 (normal C1 inhibitor, 105,000). In vitro studies of the patients' serum revealed degradation of 125I-labeled 105,000-dalton C1 inhibitor into the inactive 96,000-dalton molecule, caused by activated C1s and not found in normal human serum. We conclude that these cases of acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency resulted from a blockade of C1-inhibitor function by the anti-C1-inhibitor antibodies and from subsequent inactivation of C1 inhibitor by the now uncontrolled enzyme, activated C1s. As in other forms of C1-inhibitor deficiency, the unopposed activation of the complement system led to angioedema.\r"

The subsequent recurrence patterns of HSV infection differed markedly according to viral type and anatomical site. Oral-labial recurrences developed in 5 of 12 patients with HSV-1 and 1 of 27 patients with HSV-2 (P less than 0.001). Conversely, genital recurrences developed in 24 of 27 patients with HSV-2 and 3 of 12 patients with HSV-1 (P less than 0.01). The mean rate of subsequent genital recurrences (due to HSV-1 and HSV-2) was 0.23 per month, whereas the mean rate of oral-labial recurrences was only 0.04 per month (P less than 0.001). The mean monthly frequencies of recurrence were, in order, genital HSV-2 infections, 0.33 per month; oral-labial HSV-1 infections, 0.12 per month; genital HSV-1 infections, 0.020 per month; and oral HSV-2 infections, 0.001 per month (P less than 0.01 for each comparison). We conclude that the likelihood of reactivation of HSV infection differs between HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections and between the sacral and trigeminal anatomical sites. The sixfold more frequent clinical recurrence rate of genital HSV infections as compared with oral-labial HSV infections may account for the relatively rapid increase in the prevalence of clinically recognized genital herpes in recent years.\r"

  ".W": "The growth and differentiation of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) is regulated by soluble growth hormones, of which interleukin-2 (IL-2) is considered to be of prime importance. Here we report that the lymphokine B-cell stimulatory factor (BSF-1 or interleukin-4) also has profound effects on the generation of these functionally active T cells. In particular, BSF-1 acts as a potent helper factor for the generation of CTL in primary mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) and induces cytolytic activity in in vitro primed, MLC memory populations. Direct comparison of purified recombinant BSF-1 and IL-2 reveals BSF-1 to be the more potent CTL helper factor in primary MLC. Interestingly, the two lymphokines differed in that IL-2, but not BSF-1, induced a lytic population in cultures of unprimed cells without an overt antigenic stimulus. Collectively, our data provide a direct demonstration of a heretofore undefined mechanism by which CTL activation and amplification can occur.\r"

Embryos with a Y chromosome develop testes and become males whereas embryos lacking a Y chromosome develop ovaries and become females. Expression of H-Y, a minor histocompatibility antigen, may also be controlled by a gene on the Y chromosome, and it has been proposed that this antigen is the testis-determining factor. We have tested the postulated identity of H-Y and TDF in the human. H-Y typing with T cells was carried out on a series of sex-reversed humans (XX males and XY females), each shown by DNA hybridization to carry part but not all of the Y chromosome. This deletion analysis maps the gene for H-Y to the long arm or centromeric region of the human Y chromosome, far from the TDF locus, which maps to the distal short arm.\r"

  ".W": "Both human and murine cytotoxic T cells (CTL) elicited in response to infection with influenza A viruses have been shown to be specific for internal viral proteins, such as the matrix and nucleoprotein. Individual CTL epitopes have been identified in the nucleoprotein by successfully substituting short synthetic peptides for the intact virus in the preparation of target cells in cytotoxicity assays. The defined peptide epitopes have each been recognized by CTL in association with individual class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, H-2Db, H-2Kk, H-2Kd (Taylor, P. et al., unpublished data) and HLA-B37. A logical strategy to investigate the molecular details of the interaction between antigen and MHC class I proteins would be to define an epitope recognized by the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2. This is because the amino-acid sequence is known, several variants of A2 have been characterized and the protein has been purified and crystallized. Here we describe a peptide derived from the influenza matrix protein that is recognized by human CTL in association with the HLA-A2 molecule.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induce a cytolytic process in target cells which, like the glucocorticoid-mediated cytolysis of immature thymocytes, effects a rapid and characteristic degradation of chromosomal DNA. I have explored the possibility that these two lethal processes share a common pathway by studying the susceptibility of glucocorticoid-resistant mutants to CTL-mediated killing. Here, I report that an unusual thymoma mutant, which has normal hormone receptor activity, is resistant to both glucocorticoids and CTL. The failure to be killed by CTL is not due to an inability of this 'deathless' mutant to be recognized. Further, a single-step reversion can restore sensitivity to both glucocorticoids and CTL. The genetic locus thus identified may reveal one element of an endogenous suicide pathway that can be triggered by different effectors. Unlike complement-mediated lysis, the processes of glucocorticoid- and CTL-mediated cytolysis seem to require that target cells be active in their own death.\r"
