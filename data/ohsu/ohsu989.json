The illness was characterized by elevated peripheral blood eosinophil counts, myalgias, fatigue, and dyspnea. Two of three patients had bilateral infiltrates on chest roentgenograms. All three had markedly decreased carbon monoxide diffusing capacities and pulmonary hypertension. High-dose prednisone therapy provided only partial resolution of the pulmonary symptoms. Open lung biopsy specimens showed chronic interstitial and perivascular infiltrates in two of the patients and moderate fibrointimal hyperplasia of pulmonary vasculature in the third. High-dose prednisone therapy prior to the biopsies may have modified the original histologic features.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the relationship between respiratory mechanics and muscle strength and control of ventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD), we compared PImax and PEmax at RV, FRC and TLC, total respiratory elastance (Ers) with VT, TI, TT, VE, VT/TI, TI/TT, P.01, and P.01/(VT/TI) effective impedance in 21 patients with NMD and 21 healthy control (C) subjects, in seated position breathing room air. Ers in NMD patients was 79 percent higher than in the C subjects. While TI, TT, and VT in NMD were approximately half the corresponding C values, P.01 was 66 percent greater than in the C subjects (both p less than 0.001). NMD PImax and PEmax ranged from 37 to 52 percent of corresponding C values, respectively. Despite significant respiratory muscle weakness, only 7 of 16 patients demonstrated a PaCo2 greater than 45 mm Hg. Ventilatory output in NMD was modulated by respiratory mechanics as indicated by the increased P.01. In spite of muscle weakness, central drive in patients with NMD is not decreased, and in fact, is often increased. VE is not an accurate measure of central drive because of abnormal intrinsic respiratory mechanics and the effects of conscious responses or reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ethanol ingestion on the efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nasal CPAP) as a treatment for the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome was studied in ten obese male subjects undergoing this therapy. On the first night of polysomnography, the lowest level of CPAP that maintained airway patency was determined (critical level). On the second (control) night (C), subjects slept the entire night on this level of CPAP. On the third night (E), subjects ingested either 1.5 ml/kg (part A, N = 6) or 2.0 ml/kg (part B, N = 4) of 50 percent ethanol (100 proof vodka) over one half-hour starting 1 h before bedtime. A serum ethanol level was obtained at bedtime (part A: 63.7 +/- 17.3 mg/dl; part B: 108.6 +/- 20.6 mg/dl), and subjects were monitored on the critical level of CPAP. Comparison of nights C and E for parts A + B showed no difference in total sleep time (TST) or the amount of different sleep stages as an absolute time or a percentage of TST except that there was more stage 2 (as a percent of TST) on E nights. The apnea + hypopnea index and C and E nights did not differ and was quite low (3.6 +/- 3.7/h vs 1.9 +/- 2.7/h). Similarly, ethanol ingestion did not increase the number of desaturations to at or below 90 and 85 percent, or lower the mean arterial oxygen saturation in NREM or REM sleep. Analysis of parts A and B separately also showed no differences with respect to the apnea + hypopnea index or the number of desaturations on control and ethanol nights. We conclude that acute moderate ethanol ingestion does not decrease the efficacy of an optimum level of nasal CPAP.\r"

The only risk factors that showed significant differences (p less than 0.05) were general anesthesia and surgery and immunosuppressive disease, which were more frequent in the non-Legionella group, as were chronic liver disease and lowering of consciousness level. The absence of severe underlying disease, chronic or not, was uncommon in both groups, but more frequent in the Legionella group. We observed no differences in the clinical features of the two groups. Mean values of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and total bilirubin were higher (p less than 0.05) in the non-Legionella group. The only x-ray data that showed significant difference were pleural effusion, more frequent in the non-Legionella group (p less than 0.02). The mortality rate of legionellosis was 14.6 percent compared to 35.7 percent for the non-Legionella group (p less than 0.05). We conclude that a sure differential diagnosis based on clinical, roentgenographic and analytical features of both groups is not possible. The relatively low mortality rate of the Legionella group, when compared to other series of nosocomial legionellosis, could be due to the standard use of erythromycin in the therapeutic approach to nosocomial-acquired pneumonia in our hospital.\r"

All subjects were studied for three nights in the sleep laboratory, which included complete polysomnographic monitoring and esophageal pH recording. Multiple infusions of either 5, 15, or 25 ml of 0.1 N HCL were administered each night. Similar infusions were also accomplished in the waking state. The results showed a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in the arousal from sleep with 25-ml vs 5-ml infusions. During sleep, the latency to the first swallow was significantly (p less than .05) shorter with the 25-ml infusion when compared with that of the 5-ml infusion. While awake, the infusion volume did not affect the latency to the first swallow. The acid clearance times were not significantly altered by the different volumes infused. It is concluded that the larger volumes of acid in the esophagus create an afferent \"warning\" signal to the central nervous system to produce a rapid arousal from sleep along with a shortened interval to the first swallow. These responses rapidly empty the larger acid volumes from the esophagus.\r"

Patients with pleural tuberculosis presented significantly higher ADA activity than patients with nontuberculous pleural effusions (p less than 0.0001). The results indicated that in a population with a relatively high prevalence of tuberculosis, the analysis of ADA levels in pleural effusions constitutes a useful marker for the diagnosis which, in addition, can be made quickly and cheaply. Additionally, a comprehensive review of the literature on the role of ADA in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusions is presented.\r"

When this segment of the study was completed, the peak flow devices were subjected to 200 uses and were then retested. Four MiniWright peak flowmeters that had been extensively used in our clinic were tested as well. The Assess peak flowmeter was more accurate than the MiniWright at low flow rates (less than 300 L/min), while the MiniWright meter was more accurate at high flow rates (greater than 400 L/min). We also found that the accuracy of the MiniWright meter deteriorated after 200 uses and worsened further after extensive use, while the Assess meter retained its accuracy after 200 uses.\r"

In order to determine an element helpful for diagnosis, we examined four patients with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, three patients treated with A, without evidence of pulmonary toxicity but with a main underlying pulmonary disease, and four healthy volunteers. Daily and cumulative doses or duration of treatment were similar in the first two groups. Pulmonary function tests (spirometry, CO-diffusing capacity, arterial blood gases), roentgenographic examinations, pulmonary biopsies or immunoallergologic tests (skin reaction, lymphoblastic transformation test and human basophile degranulation test) did not provide any discriminatory element. In APT+, we observed an increased cellularity of the bronchoalveolar lavage. Neither the differential cell count nor the presence of foamy macrophages were distinguishable between APT+ and APT-. The phospholipid composition of BAL fluid showed a decreased total phospholipid and phospholipid/protein ratio in all patients compared to normal subjects. These changes reflect more the severity of pulmonary disease than the specificity of the causative agent. However, we observed that the unique PL which decreases in APT- and remains normal in APT+ is phosphatidyl-serine + phosphatidylinositol (PS + PI). This has to be confirmed and should be evaluated at different stages of the disease to determine an eventual specific element. We conclude that there are no data currently available to establish the diagnosis of APT except perhaps for the analysis of BAL PL content.\r"

The diagnosis was established in all 11 patients from specimens obtained via fiberoptic bronchoscopy (ten) and/or double-lumen catheter lavage (one). Direct stains of sedimented bronchoalveolar lavage were positive for organisms characteristic of Cryptococcus neoformans in nine of 11 patients. Transbronchial biopsies were positive (special histologic stains) in six of eight patients; bronchial washings were positive (direct smear) in seven of ten patients, the bronchial brushings were positive on stain in six of nine patients, and in one patient, a Wang transbronchial needle aspirate was positive on stain. Fungal cultures were positive on the BAL in seven of 11 patients, and on the bronchial washings in four of ten patients; the TBBx culture samples were all negative (zero of three). The serum cryptococcal antigen titer was elevated (median = 1:1024) in all eight patients in which it was assayed. Our data suggest that BAL and bronchial washings have a combined sensitivity on smear equal to that of TBBx and superior to that of TBBx fungal culture. The TBBx does not appear to be necessary in this setting. In addition, an elevated serum cryptococcal antigen titer appears to be an important adjunct in the evaluation of pulmonary infiltrates in AIDS.\r"

In all four cases, acute pulmonary embolism was shown to be the etiology of the defecation-associated events. A retrospective chart review of all patients with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism at our institution over a three-year period yielded five additional patients with the diagnosis of defecation-associated pulmonary embolism. These nine patients accounted for 6.8 percent of all patients with a discharge diagnosis of pulmonary embolism seen at our institution during the three-year study period. Six of the nine patients died from their defecation-associated pulmonary embolism. These six deaths accounted for 25 percent of all deaths from pulmonary embolism seen at our institution during the study period. Based on our experience, we suggest that the act of defecation may trigger the development of acute pulmonary embolism in some patients with deep vein thrombosis.\r"

RIA also showed that the effusions contained various amounts of M-CSF. Daily intrapleural infusion of recombinant IL-2 caused significant increase in the CSF activities and M-CSF levels in pleural effusions.

Elevation of the plasma CPK level was found in six patients who had ischemic ECG changes for at least 7.8 minutes. The duration of ischemia did not exceed 5.4 minutes in any of the patients without CPK elevation. Resolution of the ischemic changes was delayed in patients with CPK elevation and in last vs initial inflations. We conclude that in patients with noninfarcted myocardium, ECG changes follow coronary occlusion and reflow very rapidly, detecting these coronary events with a high sensitivity. Lack of rapid regression predicts lack of reperfusion, and persistence of ischemia for more than 7.8 minutes is sufficient to cause myocardial necrosis.\r"

Peak flow velocity and mean systolic gradient were inversely related to valve size (r = -0.72; r = -0.76) in group 1.

Thus, aortic flow velocity profiles in the low-profile mechanical valve were affected by pressure gradient caused by the valve size, whereas the hydromechanical disadvantage of the high profile mechanical valve affected the left ventricular pump function and Doppler-derived flow velocity profiles.\r"

The familial association of primary lung cancer is most evident among women, nonsmokers, and those with adenocarcinomas. In order to determine whether the relationship between a lower prevalence of atopy among patients with lung cancer compared to control subjects was consistent between histologic cell types, we used seven common allergens to allergy prick skin test 209 community control subjects (46 women), 109 cases with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the lung (25 women), and 67 patients with primary adenocarcinomas of the lung (23 women). We have confirmed earlier reports of an inverse relationship between atopy and lung cancer risk. In analyses focusing on sex and histologic cell type, we found that women with adenocarcinomas were an exception and were as likely to be atopic as control subjects. The evidence does not support a protective role for atopy among these women.\r"

Results of the study did not show any significant difference in any range of the measurements (p greater than 0.1) by the two methods. We conclude that the pen method is as reliable as the traditional palpation method. The sensitivity and the specificity of the two methods are comparable.

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: to characterize gas exchange and cardiopulmonary performance during maximal progressive arm crank exercise. DESIGN: Cardiopulmonary variables were measured and arterial blood gases were determined in blood samples obtained from an indwelling radial arterial catheter during arm crank exercise (34 watts/min). Arm crank exercise was compared to maximal leg exercise performed by a different but comparable group of subjects from a previous study. PARTICIPANTS: 19 healthy young (mean +/- SEM: 20 +/- 1 yr) black males. RESULTS: Peak arm crank exercise resulted in lower values compared to peak leg exercise for: power (129 +/- 2 vs 253 +/- 10 W), VO2 (2.17 +/- 0.04 vs 3.26 +/- 0.14 L/min); VCO2 (2.9 +/- 0.11 vs 4.32 +/- 0.17 L/min); HR (168 +/- 3 vs 189 +/- 3 beats/min); AT (1.15 +/- 0.05 vs 1.83 +/- 0.07 L/min); and VE (101 +/- 2 vs 144 +/- 8 L/min), respectively. Arm crank exercise (baseline vs peak) elicited an impressive improvement in PaO2 (85 +/- 1 to 97 +/- 1 mm Hg), no change in SaO2 (96 +/- 0.2 to 96 +/- 0.2 percent), no significant increase in P(A-a)O2 (3 +/- 0.7 to 5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg) and an appropriate trending decrease in VD/VT (0.22 +/- 0.01 to 0.17 +/- 0.01). Peak arm crank values were significantly different from peak cycle exercise for PaO2 (82 +/- 2.2 mm Hg), SaO2 (93 +/- 0.4 percent), P(A-a)O2 (21 +/- 1.9 mm Hg) and VD/VT (0.08 +/- 0.01). At comparable levels of VO2 for arm crank and cycle exercise (2.17 +/- 0.04 vs 2.26 +/- 0.08 L/min), significant differences were observed for PaO2 (97 +/- 1.4 vs 81 +/- 1.9 mm Hg); SaO2 (96 +/- 0.2 vs 94 +/- 0.4 percent); P(A-a)O2 (5 +/- 0.9 vs 14 +/- 1.5 mm Hg); and VD/VT (0.17 +/- 0.01 vs 0.08 +/- 0.01), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Maximal arm crank exercise represents a submaximal cardiopulmonary stress compared to maximal leg exercise. The differences in gas exchange observed at peak exercise between arm crank and leg exercise for the most part reflect the lower VO2 achieved. However, the persistence of these gas exchange differences even at a comparable level of VO2 suggests that factors other than VO2 may be operative. These factors may include differences in alveolar ventilation, CO2 production, ventilation-perfusion inequality, diffusion, and control of breathing.\r"

Data were collected at baseline, midpoint of infusion, and 2 h following infusion. Vasodilator and vasoconstrictor PG metabolites, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2, respectively, were measured in radial arterial blood samples. Slow Intralipid infusion increased shunt fraction (QS/QT) without changing mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), whereas fast Intralipid infusion increased MPAP without changing QS/QT. Prostaglandin levels did not change significantly during either infusion. However, in both groups when the PG substrate was removed, hemodynamic and metabolite values decreased in parallel. In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate a cause and effect relationship between plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and thromboxane B2 and the observed pulmonary hemodynamic response to slow or fast Intralipid infusion.\r"

  ".W": "There is much interest in the relationship between oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption in the critically ill patient. This interest is occasioned by the observation that patients with sepsis and the adult respiratory distress syndrome have a linear or \"supply-dependent\" relationship instead of the normally observed biphasic or \"supply-independent\" relationship. These relationships are only valid when subjects are at rest, since during exercise, as VO2 increases, so do DO2 and the oxygen extraction ratio (ER, VO2/DO2). We examined the VO2-DO2 relationship in a group of 16 mechanically-ventilated surgical ICU patients while they were at rest and during activities that increase VO2. At low levels of activity, where mean VO2 increased from 207 +/- 38 (SD) ml/min at rest to 241 +/- 44 ml/min, there were significant increases in mean DO2 but not mean ER. With the greater (greater than 50 percent) increases in VO2 seen with chest physical therapy, there were increases in both DO2 and ER. When the VO2-DO2 relationship during low levels of exercise and rest are plotted, a linear pattern emerges that could be misinterpreted as a \"supply dependent\" pattern. Therefore, it is important to pay close attention to the activity state of a patient when examining the VO2-DO2 relationship.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to improve the accuracy of measurement of thermal right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) using the modified Swan-Ganz catheter. Three serial ejection fractions (EFs) (EF1, 2, 3) and the mean were calculated, based on Holt's theory. RVEFs were compared between right ventricular (RV) and atrial (RA) injection in ten intensive care unit (ICU) patients using a modified catheter having RV and RA orifices (15 cm and 30 cm from the distal end, respectively), and paired duplicate (two patients) or triplicate (eight patients) measurements were performed. To determine what factors interfere with RVEF, a model heart (with diastolic volume of 150 ml) was constructed, in which model injection of cold water to the direct inflow tract (RA), to the direct mixing chamber (RV), or through the catheter running in the inflow tract were compared. When EFs were compared between RV and RA injection, those for the former were greater (RV vs RA in EF1 and EFmean: 0.46 +/- 0.15 vs 0.23 +/- 0.11 in EF1, and 0.45 +/- 0.13 vs 0.28 +/- 0.11 in EFmean, mean +/- SD, p less than 0.01). When the serial EFs were compared in each injection type, in the RV injection EF3 was the smallest as was EF1 in the RA injection. The same phenomenon was observed in the model as in the patients, and moreover when cold water was injected in RA through a catheter running through the circuit, EFs were greatly underestimated (EF1 = 0.29 +/- 0.02 at preset EF = 0.4). We conclude that these phenomena were caused by sluggish movement of the cold indicator from RA to RV when injected into RA, and by interference with the cooled cardiac chamber and catheter. Consequently, the first or second EFs obtained from RV injection might be closest to the actual values because of the least interference with those factors.\r"

  ".U": "91114409\r", 
  ".W": "The nadir of SaO2 during an obstructive apnea is dependent upon the apnea's duration and the rate of fall of saturation (dSaO2/dt). We postulated that a low Q, such as in patients with congestive heart failure with sleep apnea, or a reduction in Q, as seen in some humans during obstructive sleep apnea, might steepen dSaO2/dt. The mechanism postulated was lowering of SvO2 with increased pulmonary capillary blood oxygen uptake and faster depletion of alveolar oxygen. This study examines dSaO2/dt following the onset of apnea in eight spontaneously breathing adult baboons. Nonrepetitive obstructive apneas (30, 45, and 60 seconds) were created by clamping an indwelling cuffed endotracheal tube at the end of expiration. Following baseline measurements, the animals were given a bolus of a rapid-acting beta-adrenergic blocker followed by continuous infusion to reduce cardiac output and to limit the cardiovascular response to obstructive asphyxia. Fiberoptic catheters were used for continuous monitoring of SaO2, SvO2, and cardiac output. Esophageal pressure and relative thoracic gas volume (Respitrace) were monitored to insure equivalence of lung volume at the onset of apnea. Beta-adrenergic blockade reduced resting Q by a mean of 25 percent. The blocked vs unblocked dSaO2/dt was 0.73 vs 0.72 percent/s, 0.76 vs 0.73 percent/s, and 0.70 vs 0.71 percent/s for 30-second, 45-second, and 60-second apneas, respectively. Thus, mean dSaO2/dt for all durations of apneas was unaffected by beta-adrenergic blockade. We concluded that dSaO2/dt is not influenced by limited Q preceding or induced by obstructive asphyxia.\r"

  ".W": "To gain a better understanding of the adverse pulmonary response to amphotericin B administration reported in humans, we examined the effects of this agent in the chronically instrumented awake sheep. We measured pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures (Ppa and Pla), lung lymph flow (Qlymph), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), resistance to airflow across the lung (RL), lymph thromboxane B2 (TxB2), lymph 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, peripheral leukocyte counts, and arterial blood gases. After at least one hour of stable baseline (BL) observation, amphotericin B (Fungizone, Squibb, 1 mg/kg) was infused intravenously over 1 h. Measurements were continued for 3 h after the start of infusion. Amphotericin caused an immediate decrease in Cdyn nadiring at 55 percent of BL and an increase in Ppa from 21 +/- 1 mm Hg at BL to 44 +/- 4 at 30 minutes. RL increased to 5.5-fold over BL by 30 minutes into infusion, and lung lymph TxB2 concentrations were increased tenfold compared with BL by the end of the 1-h infusion (p less than 0.05). In this same time interval, there were increases in Qlymph (1.5 ml/15 min at BL to 4.9 +/- 0.8), but 6-keto-PGF1 alpha concentrations did not reach maximum until 2 h after the start of infusion. There was a decrease in peripheral leukocyte count and PaO2 (80 +/- 3 mm Hg at BL to 69 +/- 4 at 1 h) that returned to BL over the remaining 2 h. The temporal relationship of the TxB2 peak with these pathophysiologic changes and previous data describing the effects of thromboxane in the sheep lung suggest that a component of these alterations is due to thromboxane release. We conclude that several pulmonary system abnormalities occur following amphotericin infusion in sheep and that these findings provide a better physiologic basis for explaining the human pulmonary response to amphotericin.\r"

This may need to include the ability to identify the valve roentgenographically when history and records are unavailable. A 53-year-old woman with mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease and status post a reported Bjork-Shiley mitral valve (MV) replacement 17 years prior to hospital admission was referred for evaluation of severe hemolytic anemia. Previous cinefluoroscopy in 1986 at the time of a cerebrovascular accident revealed a normally functioning caged disc prosthesis and not the tilting disc of a Bjork-Shiley prosthetic valve. The valve was not further characterized and she continued receiving warfarin therapy until May 1989 when she presented with laboratory findings showing a marked hemolytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.5 mg/dl and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value of 2100 IU. Echocardiography revealed normal valvular function without evidence of perivalvular leak. The patient was referred for further evaluation with chest roentgenogram at the time of hospital admission revealing a valve configuration characteristic of the Beall model 103/104 series that has been found to manifest progressive disc variance with a high degree of hemolytic anemia (despite normal noninvasive evaluation of MV function), disc tilting with intermittent regurgitation, and catastrophic disc embolization in extreme cases. The precise identification of valvular prosthesis in patients after valve replacement is crucial for optimal management. As in our case, the mere identification of a particular valve may necessitate certain management and therapy based on the natural history of that valve. In the absence of reliable history and/or records, the roentgenographic examination should lead to the precise identification.\r"

We report the unusual occurrence of bilateral pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis in a young male without heart disease. Various hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reexpansion pulmonary edema include increased capillary permeability due to hypoxic injury, decreased surfactant production, altered pulmonary perfusion and mechanical stretching of membranes. This case suggests that forces leading to ipsilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema also affect the contralateral lung.\r"

  ".W": "Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a common disorder occurring in 3-6% of adults in most western populations. In the United States, 29% of patients with diabetes take insulin; of these, 76% have NIDDM. Insulin therapy is usually required at some time in NIDDM. Insulin therapy improves the abnormalities of NIDDM (reduced beta-cell function, increased hepatic glucose production, reduced peripheral glucose disposal, lipid abnormalities). Insulin and sulfonylurea agents have comparable effects on mild forms of NIDDM, but for more severe forms, insulin is usually superior. Combination insulin-sulfonylurea treatment may improve the response to sulfonylureas, although long-term well-controlled trials have not been conducted. Short-term insulin treatment may restore response to sulfonylureas. Other promising treatments (human proinsulin, nasal insulin, somatostatin) have not shown any advantage over conventional insulin therapy. Insulin causes hypoglycemia and peripheral hyperinsulinemia. The hazards of hyperinsulinemia, e.g., weight gain and hypoglycemia, have been overstated, and questions about its atherogenic effects remain to be resolved. The effect of glycemic control on macro- and microvascular complications has not been established; however, maintaining fasting blood glucose levels of less than 6.7 mM may protect against progression of retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy and reduce the severity of ischemic stroke. Dosage algorithms generally use intermediate- or long-acting insulin to control basal glycemia, with regular insulin added before meals if needed to control postprandial glycemia. Effective therapy depends on the patient being informed, cooperative, and willing to self-monitor blood glucose. Insulin treatment intermittency increases the risk for immune complications (resistance and allergy). Overall, patients with NIDDM can benefit from insulin therapy.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of insulin treatment on the pathophysiology of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) are reviewed herein. Short-term studies indicate variable and partial reduction in excessive hepatic glucose output, decrease in insulin resistance, and enhancement of beta-cell function. These beneficial actions may be due to a decrease in secondary glucose toxicity rather than a direct attack on the primary abnormality. Insulin should be used as initial treatment of new-onset NIDDM in the presence of ketosis, significant diabetes-induced weight loss (despite residual obesity), and severe hyperglycemic symptoms. In diet-failure patients, prospective randomized studies comparing insulin to sulfonylurea treatment show approximately equal glycemic outcomes or a slight advantage to insulin. A key goal of insulin therapy is to normalize the fasting plasma glucose level. In contrast to the conventional use of morning injections of intermediate- and long-acting insulin, preliminary studies suggest potential advantages of administering the same insulins only at bedtime. Obese patients may require several hundred units of insulin daily and still not achieve satisfactory control. In some, addition of a sulfonylurea to insulin may reduce hyperglycemia, the insulin dose, or both. However, long-term benefits from such combination therapy remain to be demonstrated conclusively. Established adverse effects of insulin treatment in NIDDM are hypoglycemia, particularly in the elderly, and weight gain. Self-monitoring of blood glucose can identify patients in whom excessive weight gain is caused by subtle hypoglycemia. Whether insulin causes weight gain by direct effects on appetite or energy utilization remains controversial. A potential adverse effect of insulin has been suggested by epidemiological studies showing associations between hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance and increased risk for coronary artery disease, stroke, and hypertension. Although potential mechanisms for an atherogenic action of insulin exist, current evidence does not prove cause and effect and does not warrant withholding insulin therapy (or compromising on dosage) when it is needed.\r"

  ".W": "Intensive insulin therapy is best defined as a comprehensive system of diabetes management with the patient and management team as partners. The system is directed at improvement of glycemia and patient well-being. Glycemic targets should be individually defined. Frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose, probably at least four times per day, is essential for meticulous control. The benefits include improved psychosocial functioning and the potential of lessening the risks of chronic complications of diabetes. The risks relate to problems associated with hypoglycemia, which are increased if meticulous glycemic control is sought. One of the important elements of intensive therapy is a multiple-component insulin program designed to provide effective insulinemia coinciding with each major meal and continuous basal insulinemia throughout the 24-h day. This may be achieved with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple injections with various insulin regimens, although CSII may offer real advantages in terms of the pharmacokinetics of insulin delivery. Other pharmacokinetic issues to be considered involve selection of injection sites, timing of premeal insulin, and mixing insulins. Many studies have shown that, albeit with effort, excellent glycemic control can be achieved by various intensive insulin-therapy regimens. The implementation of a program of intensive therapy involves patient self-management in terms of altering insulin dosages, food intake, and/or activity in an attempt to achieve the target level of glycemia selected. In motivated patients willing to embark on such a course of therapy, intensive insulin therapy can be worthwhile. It should be considered for all patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus.\r"

This volume of Disease-a-Month reviews the triggers and the role of inflammation in asthma, and outlines the treatment of acute asthma as well as the chronic management of reversible obstructive airways disease. There is general agreement that sympathomimetics are the treatment of choice for acute severe asthma. The role of theophylline for acute symptoms has been downplayed, and the role of corticosteroids continues to be debated. However, most authorities agree that patients with severe asthma will benefit from the addition of corticosteroids to the program. For the chronic management of asthma, appreciation that inflammation is a perpetuating feature suggests that treatment should generally be directed toward the inflammation. Corticosteroid aerosols have taken on greater prominence and have been advocated as the first line of approach. New concepts regarding the role of allergy in the perpetuation of asthma and the role of immunotherapy in its amelioration also have emerged. Medications not previously thought to be beneficial are being actively investigated. They include gold, methotrexate, and even intravenous gamma globulin.\r"

  ".W": "Specific insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that may enhance or inhibit insulin-like growth factor (IGF) action are produced in various tissues. In the present study we demonstrated that IGFBPs are synthesized and secreted by rat osteoblast-like cells (UMR 106-01). PTH and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) were potent stimuli for IGFBP production by UMR cells, whereas GH, IGF-I, insulin, epidermal growth factor, and T3 had little or no effect. A maximal 8- to 30-fold increase in IGFBP production was attained at 10(-7)-10(-6) M PTH and PTHrP, with a half-maximal effect at approximately 10(-9) M. By Western blot analysis, PTH and PTHrP markedly and selectively increased the production of 29,000 mol wt (Mr) and, to a lesser extent, 24,000 Mr IGFBPs. Agents that elevate intracellular cAMP by different mechanisms [(Bu)2cAMP, forskolin, and isobutylmethylxanthine] mimicked the effect of PTH and PTHrP on IGFBP synthesis. In comparison, PTH did not stimulate IGFBP production in fibroblasts and ROS 17/2.8 cells, which secrete IGFBPs of 42,000, 38,000, 34,000, 28,000, and 24,000 Mr, but not of 29,000 Mr. The PTH-responsive IGFBPs from UMR cells were nonglycosylated proteins with preferential affinity for IGF-I over IGF-II. These IGFBPs were not immunoprecipitated with antisera against rat IGFBP-2 or human IGFBP-1. Thus, PTH and PTHrP increase the production in UMR 106-01 cells of discrete IGFBP forms with Mr of 29,000 and 24,000 through a cAMP-mediated mechanism, independent of IGF-I synthesis. Taken with the known effects of PTH on IGF production in bone cells, the data suggest that PTH and PTHrP may modulate local IGF action in bone through the regulation of specific IGFBP availability.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the effects of PTH-induced desensitization on second messenger interactions in the rat osteosarcoma cell line ROS 17/2.8. Adenylate cyclase activation was assessed by accumulation of immunoassayable cAMP, and cytosolic calcium ion ([Ca2+]i) concentrations were measured in adherent perifused cells loaded with the Ca2(+)-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin. Preexposure to rat PTH-(1-34) [rPTH-(1-34); 10(-8) M for 48 h, then 10(-7) M for 24 h] dramatically reduced (by 85%) the cAMP response to fresh challenge [2 min; 10(-9)-10(-7) M rPTH-(1-34)], but the peak PTH-induced rise of [Ca2+]i was not diminished significantly (0-20%). Nevertheless, we did observe other changes in the PTH-induced [Ca2+]i response. Exposure of treated cells to (Bu)2cAMP nearly abolished the [Ca2+]i response to PTH (greater than 80% reduction), but had much less effect on the PTH-stimulated [Ca2+]i increment of the naive cells (less than 35% reduction). Treated cells also had a blunted [Ca2+]i response to PTH in the presence of low extracellular calcium (greater than 60% reduction), but in the naive cells, low extracellular Ca2+ did not significantly diminish the peak PTH-induced [Ca2+]i rise, although low extracellular Ca2+ dramatically reduced the area under this [Ca2+]i transient (greater than 50%). Low extracellular Ca2+ had no influence on the peak [Ca2+]i responses of treated cells to bradykinin or prostaglandin F2 alpha. Although the peak PTH-stimulated [Ca2+]i rise of treated cells in normal Ca2+ medium was not significantly attenuated, the time to half-maximum [Ca2+]i concentration was significantly increased (greater than 100%), and the area under the [Ca2+]i transient was diminished. These alterations in the [Ca2+]i response of treated cells were not observed upon challenge with bradykinin or prostaglandin F2 alpha. Thus, 1) the cAMP and [Ca2+]i responses of ROS 17/2.8 cells to rPTH-(1-34) are not obligatorily coupled; 2) the response of naive cells to PTH includes both the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and the entry of extracellular Ca2+; and 3) pretreatment of these cells with rPTH-(1-34) augments the dependence on Ca2+ entry during hormone rechallenge. We propose that the preserved PTH-stimulated [Ca2+]i rise in treated cells results partly from loss of cAMP-mediated inhibition of extracellular Ca2+ entry.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the mechanism(s) during pubertal development by which androgens alter hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression and beta-endorphin content, we used the technique of in situ hybridization histochemistry and the androgen-insensitive testicular feminized (Tfm) rat. We evaluated POMC mRNA levels in the arcuate nuclei and periarcuate regions of 12 coronal brain slices from prepubertal (age, 30 days) and adult (age, 60 days) normal male and Tfm rats (n = 4 for each group). Hybridizations were performed using an 35S-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe complementary to a 30-base sequence within POMC mRNA. The tissue sections were sequentially exposed to x-ray film and photographic emulsion with subsequent analysis by both densitometry and computer-assisted grain counting. beta-Endorphin was measured in hypothalamic tissue blocks from similar animals in each of the four experimental groups. The results of densitometry and grain counting were consistent and revealed an increase in POMC mRNA with pubertal development in both the male and Tfm animals. The concentration of hypothalamic beta-endorphin was greater for the adult Tfm animals than for all other groups, which did not differ from each other. These results suggest that androgens may stimulate POMC gene transcription by their action through estrogen receptors after conversion by aromatase. Alternatively, additional pubertal factors may be responsible for act directly through their respective receptors to alter translation, posttranslational processing, or secretion of beta-endorphin, resulting in diminished intracellular hypothalamic peptide concentration.\r"

  ".U": "91114616\r", 
  ".W": "We investigated pituitary regulation of growth during two critical stages of development in the rat, using hypophysectomy (Hx) with replacement of GH and/or T4. In the neonatal period (Hx on day 6), body weight and tail length were inhibited by 60% and 50%, respectively, while these parameters were inhibited by 80% and 85% by Hx in the juvenile period (Hx on day 45). Administration of T4 alone significantly increased skeletal growth (tail length) in neonatal Hx rats, while T4 alone proved ineffective in promoting somatic growth in juvenile Hx rats. GH effects were greater on body weight than on tail length at both stages of development. Replacement of both GH and T4 restored somatic growth to normal values during both time periods. The brain was the sole organ whose growth appeared to be independent of the pituitary. Hx reduced serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and -II in both age groups, and GH alone restored IGF-I and -II levels to the control range. The major IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) were analyzed by Western ligand blots. The effect of Hx on the predominant IGFBP was greater in the juvenile rat. T4 replacement in the neonate and GH replacement in the juvenile rat restored IGFBPs to control levels. We conclude that somatic growth in the rat is less pituitary dependent in the neonatal period. There are also important age-specific differences in organ response to GH and T4. Serum IGFs and their binding proteins are pituitary dependent even in infancy, and GH is their primary regulator. The neonatal Hx rat is an important model for the study of the dynamic development of the pituitary-dependent growth.\r"

  ".W": "Quiescent Swiss 3T3 cells can be stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by various mitogens used in synergistic combinations with insulin-like growth factors (IGFs). The cells constitutively secrete an IGF-binding protein (IGFBP), which can modulate the interaction of IGFs with their receptors and could, therefore, alter cellular responsiveness to IGFs. We have now characterized the IGFBP secreted by Swiss 3T3 cells and tested whether its secretion is regulated by heterologous mitogens. Ligand blotting using [125I]IGF-I revealed a major IGFBP of 40,000 mol wt, and treatment of the cells with tunicamycin reduced the mol wt of this protein to about 32,000. mRNA from Swiss 3T3 cells hybridized to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (50-mer) complementary to rat IGFBP-3. Taken together, these results indicate that the principal IGFBP secreted by Swiss 3T3 cells is probably the N-glycosylated IGFBP-3. Production of this IGFBP by Swiss 3T3 cells was stimulated by 50-150% by the mitogens bombesin, vasopressin, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and also by IGF-I. The increased production of IGFBP was first detected after 4-6h of incubation and was then maintained for 48-72 h. Agents that elevate intracellular cAMP and the glucocorticoid dexamethasone reduced IGFBP output. In cells in which protein kinase-C had been down-modulated, the stimulation of IGFBP output by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate was abolished, but the stimulation induced by the other mitogens was not prevented. Thus, the production of IGFBP by Swiss 3T3 cells can be regulated by a number of different signalling pathways.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadal steroids have been implicated in the modulation of GH secretory patterns in the rat. We have studied the effects of testosterone (T) or estradiol (E2) on the steady state clearance (Clss) and plasma half-life (t1/2) of GH in male and female rats (n = 4-6/group). A femoral and a jugular cannula were surgically implanted into adult Sprague-Dawley rats. At the time of cannulation some rats were orchidectomized, and a Silastic capsule containing E2, T, or nothing was implanted sc. After recovery from surgery, either purified rat GH or a crude extract of rat pituitary was infused iv to attain steady state plasma GH concentrations. Blood samples were taken every 30 min for 4 h during the infusion, and nine samples were taken at 2.5-min intervals immediately after stopping the infusion. The mean Clss for GH in female rats were significantly (P less than or equal to 0.001) less than that in males, whereas the t1/2 did not differ between the two groups. Neither the Clss nor the t1/2 was affected by castration in males or females. The Clss of GH in E2-treated castrated males was significantly less (P less than 0.001) than that for intact males, but the t1/2 did not differ between the two groups. The Clss for GH was greater in T-treated ovariectomized rats than in intact females, but the t1/2 did not differ with T treatment. These results suggest that 1) the Clss for GH is lower in female rats than in males; 2) 4 weeks of gonadectomy has no effect on the Clss in males or females; 3) under experimental conditions, E2 decreases and T increases the Clss for GH; and 4) the t1/2 for GH is not different in males or females. The steroid-induced changes in Clss in the absence of detectable effects on t1/2 suggest that factors affecting the volume of distribution at steady state (i.e. plasma GH-binding proteins or GH heterogeneity) are involved in the effects of gonadal steroids on GH clearance in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "The development of the thymus and the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis are linked by bidirectional hormonally mediated relationships. In the present study, the direct involvement of the neuropeptide LHRH in the maturation of the thymus and development of the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses were assessed after treatment of neonatal (from post-natal day 1-day 5) female rats with a potent LHRH-antagonist (LHRH-anta, p-Glu-D-Phe 2.6,Pro3-LHRH, 50 micrograms/rat), and the effects compared to those resulting from neonatal castration. Whereas in control animals the maturation of mitogenic potential in thymocyte cultures showed a progressive and age-dependent increase, reaching a maximal activity at 30 days of age and then decreasing after puberty onset, in LHRH-anta-treated rats, the thymocyte's proliferative response was completely blocked at 7 days of age and remained very low at each time interval studied, until 3 months of age. A similar effect of the LHRH-anta treatment on splenocyte cultures was measured. Moreover, a reduced percentage of the T-helper lymphocyte subpopulation followed LHRH-anta administration. By contrast, in neonatally castrated rats, blastogenic activity was significantly higher, compared to control cultures, at each stage studied. Treatment with LHRH-anta produced a significant decrease in thymus wt, an alteration of the maturational pattern characterized by a cellular monomorphism, reduced thymocyte volume, reduction of the cortical area, and depauperation of the epithelial microenvironment. Moreover, a morphometric analysis revealed a selective decrease in the large lymphoid cell population of the subcapsular cortex at 7 and 15 days. On the other hand, neonatal castration produced an opposite effect, leading to a marked hypertrophy of the cortical area, and counteracted the post-puberal thymus atrophy. When LHRH-anta-treated adult (3-month-old) rats were challenged with an antigenic stimulus (multiple sc injections of complete Freund adjuvant and BSA) and antibody (anti-BSA antibodies of the immunoglobulin G class) production measured in the serum after 15 days, a marked and significant decrease in immunoglobulin G levels was observed, compared to the values measured in untreated control. The described immune deficiencies in LHRH-anta-treated rats were associated with a clear inhibition of sexual maturation. This study clearly indicates that the blockade of central and peripheral LHRH receptors during a critical period for maturation of both hypothalamus-hypophyseal-gonadal axis and brain-thymus-lymphoid axis dramatically impairs immune system development, suggesting a potential role of the neuropeptide LHRH in the bidirectional programming of both neuroendocrine and immune functions.\r"

  ".W": "In seasonally breeding mammals, seasonal alterations in day length are perceived via the pineal hormone melatonin. When exposed to short day lengths, hamsters and other long-day breeders undergo gonadal regression. With chronic exposure (greater than 20 weeks) to short days, however, the animals become photorefractory, or insensitive to the inhibitory influence of short-day melatonin patterns, and gonadal recrudescence occurs. In this report, we examined photorefractory Siberian hamsters and long-day housed control hamsters to examine whether this apparent insensitivity to melatonin is due to alterations in melatonin receptors or signal transduction. In vitro autoradiographic assessment of melatonin receptors using 125I-labeled 2-iodomelatonin (I-MEL) revealed that melatonin receptor distribution, affinity, density, and G protein coupling are unaltered in photorefractory animals. In each animal, high-affinity (dissociation constant approximately 40 pM) 2-iodomelatonin binding sites were observed in the hypophysial pars tuberalis, in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and in the thalamus (paraventricular nucleus, reuniens nucleus, and nucleus of the stria medullaris). The nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTP gamma S (100 microM) caused a 10-fold reduction in melatonin receptor affinity in the pars tuberalis in both photorefractory and control hamsters, demonstrating receptor-G protein coupling in both groups. Furthermore, melatonin (10 nM) inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in median eminence/pars tuberalis explants in photorefractory animals, just as previously observed in explants from long-day hamsters. These results suggest that melatonin receptors, receptor-G protein coupling, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by melatonin are not altered in photorefractory hamsters.\r"

  ".W": "Life-long sequential changes in glucose tolerance and insulin secretion were investigated in genetically obese Zucker rats (fa/fa) fed a diabetogenic diet rich in lard and sucrose. Comparisons were made with lean littermates (Fa/-) receiving normal chow diet. At 3-month intervals, seven to nine lean and obese rats had two permanent venous catheters implanted, allowing stress- and pain-free sampling of blood before, during, and after substrate administration. Intravenous glucose, iv arginine, and oral glucose tolerance were tested. The obese rats progressively developed hyperglycemia and severe hyperinsulinemia; their basal glycemia reached 8.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter in the lean rats at 46 weeks of age; respective insulinemia was 287.7 +/- 61.9 and 18.1 +/- 2.8 mU/liter (mean +/- SD). In the obese rats a distinct loss in glucose tolerance was seen with progression of age in spite of rising stimulated insulin secretion, which suggests progressive development of insulin resistance without exhaustion of B-cell secretory capacity. Absence of insulin deficiency was also suggested by immunohistochemical staining of pancreatic tissue specimens from obese rats, which showed large populations of insulin-containing cells. Like the obese animals, lean rats exhibited a decrease in insulin sensitivity with age. Relating basal individual glycemia and insulinemia, a rise by 1 mmol/liter in glycemia was associated with a 8.8-fold rise in basal insulinemia in lean rats, but only with a 1.8-fold increase in obese rats. Similar correlations for stimulated glycemia and insulinemia suggest impaired glucose sensitivity of pancreatic B-cells in obese vs. lean rats. In conclusion, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats on a diabetogenic diet are not characterized by quantitatively deficient B-cell secretory capacity, but, rather, by impaired B-cell sensitivity to glucose with qualitatively intact regulation of glycemia and insulinemia at elevated plasma concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of monosodium glutamate (MSG) to neonatal rodents produces permanent lesions of hypothalamic arcuate neurons that secrete GH-releasing hormone (GHRH). The present study was intended to determine the consequences of GHRH deficiency on the pulsatile GH secretory pattern and growth in MSG-treated female rats and to compare these effects with those observed in male littermates. Male and female rats were injected with MSG [4 mg/g body wt (BW), sc] or saline (controls) on days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after birth. Immunoreactive GHRH concentrations were decreased in the hypothalamus (by 60%) and in the median eminence (by 95%) of adult male and female MSG-treated rats. In contrast, somatostatin concentrations were unaffected. BW and linear growth were severely impaired in male MSG-treated rats, but in MSG-lesioned females BW was not different from controls, and the attenuation of longitudinal growth was less severe and the obesity more pronounced than in males. These sex differences occurred despite similar reductions (by 55%) in serum insulin-like growth factor I concentrations in male and female MSG-treated rats. MSG treatment also produced decreases in pituitary wt and GH content (by 60%), independent of sex. Pulsatile GH secretion was studied by serial blood sampling of chronically cannulated, freely moving rats. Plasma GH patterns were analyzed by the PULSAR program. Compared to controls, treatment with MSG led to a marked inhibition (by 90%) of GH secretion in both sexes. Significant reductions in GH pulse amplitude (-95%) and pulse duration (-62%) were observed in males, whereas pulse amplitude (-85%), pulse frequency (-67%), and baseline GH concentrations (-80%) were markedly reduced in females. The GH responses to an iv bolus injection of rat GHRH (1 microgram/rat) was severely blunted in both male and female MSG-treated rats. This study demonstrates that GHRH deficiency in female rats results in a marked inhibition of GH pulses, as in males, but also causes severe and sex-specific reductions in GH basal secretion and pulse frequency. These observations suggest that hypothalamic GHRH secretion in female rats is more continuous than in males and is a determinant of the elevated interpulse secretion of GH. Moreover, body wt and linear growth are less severely affected by arcuate lesions in female animals, compared to males. These sex-related differences in growth rates may result in part from the tendency of female MSG-lesioned rats to become more obese than males, and the development of obesity, in turn, may antagonize the factors that tend to slow linear growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

During 4 days of culture, 1-1000 nM corticosterone had no significant effect on the increase in dry weight or on DNA content, but 100 and 1000 nM corticosterone did inhibit the increase in calcium content. Light microscopic examination of the 4-day cultures demonstrated a glucocorticoid-induced change in osteoblast shape and organization along the mineralizing front of the bone. A dose-dependent inhibition of fibronectin secretion into the medium was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In control cultures, fibronectin production was 0.105 +/- 0.005 microgram/ml.bone at 24 h and 0.397 +/- 0.037 microgram/ml.bone during the 72- to 96-h interval. The maximal inhibition of fibronectin secretion was 45% at 24 h and 70% at 96 h with 1000 nM corticosterone. Both immunofluorescent visualization of fibronectin staining in the tissue and a Western blot of fibronectin in the tissue showed a decrease in fibronectin levels. At 24 and 96 h, a dose- and time-dependent decrease in fibronectin mRNA transcripts was found. At 24 and 96 h, 1000 nM corticosterone produced a decrease of 42% and 62%, respectively, in fibronectin mRNA levels. Our findings show that glucocorticoids inhibit fibronectin production in developing bone. The decrease in fibronectin synthesis may contribute to altered osteoblast organization and function during bone formation.\r"

On the other hand, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their receptors seem to be involved in the growth of certain breast carcinoma cells by autocrine or paracrine effects. Since the effects of both IGF-I and IGF-II may be modulated by specific binding proteins (IGF-BPs) we examined the possibility that one mechanism by which retinoic acid may inhibit cancer growth is by an alteration in these BPs, thereby blocking IGF's growth effect. Retinoic acid (RA; 1 microM) completely blocked the effect of IGF-I (50 ng/ml) on enhancing proliferation of MCF-7 cells in culture. This effect of RA was not associated with any significant change in specific IGF-I-binding sites on these cells. RA induced a 3-fold increase in IGF-binding activity in conditioned medium, measured using a polyethylene glycol-immunoglobulin precipitation assay and a charcoal absorption assay. This increase was associated with the appearance of 42- and 46-kDa IGF-BPs on ligand blotting. The effect of RA on these IGF-BPs was time and concentration dependent. In contrast, during some experiments the 27- and 36-kDa BPs actually decreased. These findings support the hypothesis that RA may inhibit the growth of certain breast carcinoma cells by increasing the secretion of certain IGF-BPs, which could directly modulate the growth effect of IGFs.\r"

To determine whether the lipocortins affect the release of PRL from human decidua, decidual cells from term pregnancies were exposed to recombinant lipocortin-I for 96 h, with medium changes at 24-h intervals. Lipocortin-I (0.01-100 nM) caused a time- and dose-dependent inhibition of PRL release, with a half-maximal effective dose of 50 nM. PRL release was inhibited by 27%, 62%, 93%, and 98% at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively. The cells exposed to lipocortin-I did not release the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase, indicating that the inhibitory effect on PRL release was not due to cell death. In addition to inhibiting basal PRL release, lipocortin also completely inhibited the stimulation of PRL release by decidual PRL-releasing factor, a 23.5-kDa protein recently purified from human placenta that stimulates the synthesis and release of decidual, but not pituitary, PRL. Hydrocortisone and dexamethasone (0.1-10 microM) had no effect on PRL release, and arachidonic acid (2-100 microM) inhibited rather than stimulated PRL release. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of lipocortin-I in decidual cells and conditioned media. On Northern blot, decidual mRNA hybridized to an oligonucleotide for lipocortin-I. These results strongly suggest that lipocortin-I has an autocrine/paracrine role in regulation of the synthesis and release of PRL from human decidual cells.\r"

Among the variants tested, desialylated hCG (as-hCG) was the most potent inhibitor, followed by alpha-as-beta, as-alpha-beta, and hCG in that order. With respect to their abilities to stimulate cAMP generation in the cells, the activities of all desialylated hCG variants were markedly higher than that of hCG itself, and as in the receptor assay, as-hCG was the most potent stimulator tested. At the same concentration (100 micrograms/ml), as-alpha-beta, alpha-as-beta, and hCG were approximately only 57%, 46%, and 27% as active as as-hCG in activating cAMP production. The findings in the growth assay were entirely consistent with those noted in the cAMP response assay. Among the deglycosylated hybrids examined, alpha-dg-beta was the most effective in activating cAMP release. An equivalent dose (200 micrograms/ml) was about 1.7, 2.7, and 3.8 times as active as dg-hCG dg-alpha-beta, and hCG, respectively. The deglycosylated variants of hCG showed a similar pattern of activity in growth response and cAMP accumulation assays. In both cases, alpha-dg-beta was the most potent stimulator, while hCG was the least active. No significant difference between the potencies of dg-alpha-beta and alpha-dg-beta was discerned in the receptor assay; however, deglycosylated hCG (dg-hCG) was sharply more active. Results of these studies strongly suggest that the optimal expression of in vitro thyrotropic activity of hCG variants in FRTL-5 cells may require an alpha-subunit, with intact carbohydrate, in combination with the deglycosylated beta-subunit. Further, they demonstrate that modification of the hCG carbohydrate moiety alone can transform it from a weak agonist to a potent stimulator of in vitro thyrotropic bioactivity. These results also provide further evidence to support the notion that the degree of expression of thyrotropic activity is strongly affected by the species in which the studies are performed.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin enhances the ability of TSH to induce iodide uptake in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells maintained in 5% serum; however, in cells maintained in 0.2% serum, insulin inhibits the ability of TSH to induce iodide uptake. Since the inhibitory action of insulin is duplicated by 100-fold lower concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), inhibition appears to be mediated by the IGF-I receptor. Insulin and IGF-I inhibit the action of a cAMP analog to induce iodide uptake in a manner identical to TSH, but do not inhibit basal or TSH-increased cAMP levels; inhibition, thus, results from regulation of cAMP signal action rather than cAMP signal generation. Inhibition is associated with a more than 2-fold decrease in the maximum velocity of iodide influx, a less than 15% change in the rate of iodide efflux, and no change in the Km for iodide influx, i.e. inhibition effectively results from a decrease in the number of iodide porters. The inhibitory action of insulin/IGF-I is not additive with hydrocortisone, which, under the same conditions, also inhibits TSH- or cAMP-induced iodide porter activity. Actinomycin-D, given 24 h after TSH, superinduces TSH-induced iodide porter activity and abolishes the inhibition by insulin, IGF-I, and/or hydrocortisone; a similar paradoxical effect of actinomycin-D under these conditions has been explained by its ability to inhibit the action of a cAMP-induced factor that increases mRNA degradation. The inhibitory actions of insulin, IGF-I, and hydrocortisone on cAMP-induced iodide porter activity contrast with their simultaneous and synergistic stimulation of the transcriptional action of cAMP on DNA and thyroglobulin synthesis under these conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Studies in the rat and rabbit indicate that facilitatory effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) as well as norepinephrine (NE) on LH and LHRH release are dependent on the presence of the ovarian steroid estrogen. However, we have previously found the NE and an alpha-1-adrenergic agonist are both stimulatory to pulsatile LHRH release in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys. In the present experiment the effects of NPY on LHRH release were examined in conscious monkeys using a push-pull perfusion method. Twelve gonadectomized monkeys (8 females and 4 males) were used. Perfusate samples from the stalk-median eminence (S-ME) were obtained through a push-pull cannula at 10-min intervals for 12 h, and the amount of LHRH in samples were determined with RIA. NPY dissolved in a modified Krebs-Ringer phosphate buffer solution at concentrations of 10(-8), 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M was directly infused into the S-ME through the push cannula for 10 min at 90-min intervals. Vehicle was infused as a control. Since sex differences in LHRH response to NPY were not present, data from males and females were combined for analysis. NPY infusion into the S-ME stimulated LHRH release in a dose-dependent manner (P less than 0.001). The peak LHRH responses (mean +/- SEM) to NPY at different concentrations were: 10(-8) M = 2.1 +/- 0.4 pg/ml; 10(-7) M = 2.6 +/- 0.5 pg/ml; 10(-6) M = 6.5 +/- 1.1 pg/ml; 10(-5) M = 15.1 +/- 2.9 pg/ml, whereas to vehicle 0.37 +/- 0.17 pg/ml. All NPY doses tested were significantly effective as compared to vehicle (P less than 0.01). The LHRH response to 10(-6) M was greater (P less than 0.01) than that of 10(-8) M or 10(-7) M, and the response to 10(-5) M was greater (P less than 0.01) than that of all lower doses. The results indicate that NPY infusion into the S-ME elicits the release of LHRH in vivo in a dose-dependent manner in the monkey. The data further suggest that LHRH neurons and/or neuroterminals in the monkey are responsive to NPY stimulation in the absence of gonadal steroids. It is concluded that in addition to NE, NPY is an important regulator of pulsatile LHRH release in the nonhuman primate.\r"

  ".W": "These studies characterized the secretion of GH-releasing factor (GRF) and somatostatin (SRIF) into the hypophysial portal circulation in ewes after long term restricted feeding. In addition, we examined the temporal relationship between the concentrations of these two hypothalamic peptides in portal blood and the concentration of GH in jugular blood. Six sheep were fed 1000 g hay/day (normal feeding) and 6 sheep were fed 400-600 g hay/day (restricted feeding). This resulted in a wt loss of 35% in restricted animals compared with 6% in control animals after 20 weeks. Fluctuations in portal levels of GRF indicated a pulsatile pattern of secretion with approximately 60% of pulses coincident with, or immediately preceding, a GH pulse. Similarly, 65% of GH pulses were associated with GRF pulses. Restricted feeding increased (P less than 0.01) mean ( +/- SEM) plasma GH levels (9.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 2.9 +/- 0.6 ng/ml) and mean GH pulse amplitude (7.9 +/- 1.8 vs. 2.8 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) but did not affect mean GH pulse frequency (6.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.7 +/- 1.1 pulses/8 h). The level of feeding had no effect on mean portal concentration of GRF (restricted: 5.5 +/- 0.8, normal: 6.6 +/- 1.4 pg/ml), GRF pulse amplitude (14.7 +/- 2.3 vs. 13.5 +/- 0.7 pg/ml), or GRF pulse frequency (5.3 +/- 1.1 vs. 6.7 +/- 0.9 pulses/8 h). Portal concentrations of SRIF in sheep on a restricted diet were half (P less than 0.01) those of sheep fed a normal diet (10.2 +/- 2.3 vs. 19.6 +/- 1.6 pg/ml). Pulses of SRIF were not significantly associated with changes in GH or GRF concentrations. These data indicate a functional role for hypothalamic GRF in initiating GH pulses. Furthermore, the increase in GH secretion in underfed sheep was most probably due to a decrease in the release of SRIF into hypophysial portal blood. Restricted feeding had no affect on GRF secretion, but because of the reduced exposure of the pituitary gland to SRIF, it is possible that responsiveness to GRF is enhanced.\r"

  ".U": "91114631\r", 
  ".W": "Estrous cycles in mares have several unique characteristics, including the presence of a long period of estrus and the absence of a typical LH surge. Like follicles of other species, equine preovulatory follicles are characterized by their ability to secrete large amounts of 17 beta-estradiol, but it is not clear which follicular cell type is responsible for estradiol synthesis in mares. To better understand the relative roles of theca interna and granulosa cells in follicular steroidogenesis, presumptive ovulatory follicles were obtained from mares during early estrus (first or second day of estrus; n = 4) and during late estrus (fourth or fifth day of estrus; n = 4). Preparations of theca interna and granulosa cells were cultured for 3 days in medium with or without equine LH, FSH, LH plus FSH, or CG (100 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of 0.5 microM testosterone, and culture media were assayed for progesterone, androstenedione, and 17 beta-estradiol. Progesterone was the predominant steroid secreted by granulosa cells in the absence of exogenous testosterone. Its accumulation was significantly higher in cultures of granulosa cells from late vs. early estrus (P less than 0.05), and all gonadotropins stimulated progesterone secretion at both stages of follicular development (P less than 0.05). In contrast, granulosa cells secreted very low amounts of androstenedione in vitro, and only very small amounts of 17 beta-estradiol were produced when cells were cultured in medium without testosterone. However, the addition of testosterone caused a 170-fold increase over control values in estradiol accumulation over 3 days of culture (P less than 0.0001), clearly indicating the presence of a very active aromatase enzyme system in equine granulosa cells. Steroid secretion by theca interna differed in several respects from secretion by granulosa cells. Theca interna from early and late estrous follicles secreted negligible amounts of progesterone in vitro, and equine gonadotropins had no effect on its secretion. Also, theca interna secreted only small amounts of estradiol in vitro, and its accumulation was not increased by the addition of exogenous testosterone. Also, in contrast to granulosa cell cultures, androstenedione was the predominant steroid secreted by theca interna from early and late estrous follicles. In conclusion, this study does not support the current model of equine follicular steroidogenesis, which holds that 17 beta-estradiol biosynthesis derives primarily from the theca interna layer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II)/Mannose 6-P receptor (Man 6-P) is a multifunctional receptor that binds two unrelated ligands, IGF-II and lysosomal enzymes that contain Man 6-P recognition markers. Although this receptor has been extensively characterized in mammalian cells, binding of radiolabeled IGF-II to this receptor in avian cells and tissues has not been reported. In the present study, we demonstrate that chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) bind and internalize lysosomal enzymes in a Man 6-P-inhibitable fashion, and possess a protein immunologically related to the mammalian IGF-II/Man 6-P receptor that binds lysosomal enzymes with Man 6-P recognition markers but does not bind IGF-II. 1) When lysates of biosynthetically labeled CEFs were affinity-purified on beta-galactosidase-Sepharose, an approximately 250 kilodalton protein was observed in the Man 6-P eluate but not in the Glc 1-P or mannose eluates, that was precipitated by antisera to purified rat and bovine IGF-II/Man 6-P receptors, but not by nonimmune serum. 2) When CEFs were incubated with [35S]proteins enriched in lysosomal enzymes, Man 6-P inhibited binding (0 C) and uptake (34 C) in a dose-dependent fashion. Binding was unchanged in the absence of divalent cations. At low sugar concentrations, binding and uptake were inhibited selectively by Man 6-P and the conformationally similar sugar phosphate, Fru 1-P, a specificity similar to that of mammalian cation-independent Man 6-P receptors. 3) When affinity-purified lysates from biosynthetically labeled CEFs were incubated with antiserum to the rat IGF-II/Man 6-P receptor, a 245 kilodalton protein was immunoprecipitated from lysates that had been affinity purified on beta-galactosidase-Sepharose but not after purification on IGF-II-Sepharose. By contrast, a truncated IGF-II/Man 6-P receptor, presumably internalized from the fetal bovine serum used to feed the cells, was purified from lysates of unlabeled CEFs on IGF-II-Sepharose. Thus, CEFs possess a cation-independent Man 6-P receptor that is similar in size and immunological reactivity to the mammalian IGF-II/Man 6-P receptor, and binds and internalizes lysosomal enzymes but, unlike the mammalian receptor, does not bind IGF-II.\r"

  ".W": "Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death that occurs under numerous physiological conditions, including endocrine regulation of specific cell populations. We have investigated the biochemical mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in rat thymocytes. Internucleosomal cleavage of chromatin into oligonucleosomal fragments is common to all forms of apoptosis and precedes the onset of cell death. To identify the endonuclease that is responsible for the specific pattern of DNA degradation in glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, we have developed an assay to measure internucleosomal cleavage activity in thymocyte nuclear extracts. This assay uses nuclei from cells resistant to hormone-induced DNA fragmentation (HeLa cells) as a substrate for nuclear extracts prepared from thymocytes of adrenalectomized rats treated with either dexamethasone (dex) or vehicle (control). After incubation at room temperature for 90 min, the HeLa DNA is purified, and its integrity is analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The appearance of internucleosomal fragments of HeLa DNA is indicative of nuclease activity in the thymocyte nuclear extract. Nuclear extracts prepared from thymocytes of rats treated with dex for 5 h caused internucleosomal cleavage of HeLa DNA, whereas extracts from control rats did not result in any DNA fragmentation. Regulation of nuclease activity by dex was time dependent. Internucleosomal cleavage activity in thymocyte extract from dex-treated animals was detected as early as 2 h after hormone treatment and occurred before any detectable change in cell viability. Maximal extractable nuclease activity was coincident with decreased thymocyte viability and thymic involution. In contrast, extracts from medullary thymocytes, which are the only thymocytes that survive 72 h of glucocorticoid treatment, did not contain nuclease activity by this assay. Regulation of internucleosomal cleavage activity by dex was dose dependent and was specific for the glucocorticoid class of steroid hormones. Furthermore, the dex-induced response was inhibited by pretreating rats with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486, indicating that receptor-mediated processes are involved in the regulation of nuclease activity. The similarities between the regulation of internucleosomal cleavage activity reported here and the previously described degradation of thymocyte DNA in vivo makes this nuclease a likely constituent of the apoptotic process.\r"

This last effect of CRH was blocked by corticotropin inhibiting peptide (CIP), at a concentration (10(-6) M) which was found to completely annul B response of adrenal slices to ACTH (10(-8) M). In light of many findings indicating that adrenal medulla contains and releases CRH and numerous POMC-derived peptides, the hypothesis is advanced that an intra-adrenal CRH/ACTH mechanism may be operative in the control of adrenocortical steroid-hormone secretion.\r"

We have synthesized an IGF-II analog, [Leu27]IGF-II, that is highly selective for the type-II IGF receptor. Receptor binding experiments demonstrate a high affinity for the type-II IGF receptor, analogous to synthetic (syn) and recombinant (rec) IGF-II, but no affinity for the type-I IGF and the insulin receptor at concentrations up to 50 and 200 ng/ml, respectively. The lack of affinity for these two receptors is confirmed by biological studies which demonstrated that this analog, in contrast with synIGF-II, did not stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation in Balb/c 3T3 cells. [Leu27]IGF-II opens new ways to identify which actions of IGF-II are mediated via the type-II receptor and which are due to cross reactivity with the type-I IGF or the insulin receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Peripheral glucose uptake can occur by either insulin- or noninsulin-mediated mechanisms, and the two pathways appear to be regulated independently. Using the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique, we have previously demonstrated that sepsis induces whole body insulin resistance. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether infection also alters noninsulin-mediated glucose uptake (NIMGU) and, if so, which tissues are affected. Studies were performed in chronically catheterized conscious rats under either basal (6 mM glucose, 30 microU/ml insulin) or insulinopenic conditions to determine NIMGU. Hypermetabolic sepsis was induced by sc injections of live Escherichia coli, and 24 h later a tracer amount of [U-14C]deoxy-2-glucose was injected for the determination of the in vivo glucose metabolic rate (Rg) in selected tissues. Our results indicate that NIMGU is the predominant route of glucose disposal in both septic and nonseptic rats, accounting for 79-83% of the total rate of glucose disposal. Because the rate of whole body glucose disposal was increased by sepsis, the absolute rate of NIMGU was 46% higher in septic rats than in nonseptic animals. This increase was the result of the elevated Rg in liver, spleen, ileum, and lung. Sepsis also increased whole body insulin-mediated glucose uptake by 88% under basal conditions, and this was due to an enhanced glucose uptake by muscle and skin. In insulinopenic animals in which the plasma glucose concentration was elevated to 17 mM, whole body glucose disposal increased by 107% in nonseptic animals, but by only 32% in septic rats. The hyperglycemic-induced increment in organ Rg was smaller in all tissues examined from septic animals. However, the absolute rate of whole body and tissue glucose utilization was not different between the two groups. These results indicate that gram-negative infection increases whole body NIMGU, which results from an enhanced rate of glucose utilization by tissues rich in mononuclear phagocytes, including the liver, spleen, ileum, and lung, but not by muscle.\r"

Thus a non-transformed rat clonal osteoblastic cell population CRP 10/30 and the immortalized cell line IRC10/30-myc1 derived from it, which both express the osteoblastic phenotype, were now investigated. Both produced hemopoietic growth activity after treatment with recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor alpha. This activity eluted from diethylaminoethyl Sephacel at 0.2-0.3 M NaCl, and migrated on Sephacryl S-200 at a mol wt of around 30 k, as described for murine GM- and G-CSF. On a Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B column, it was separated into two peaks appearing at position where GM (peak I) and G-CSF (peak II) are expected to be eluted. Antisera against GM-CSF inhibited the activity of peak I. In the colony assay in semisolid medium, peak I induced colonies of the GM-type and peak II of the G-type. These data indicate that cloned osteoblasts produce GM- and G-CSF. Through CSF production, osteoblasts might regulate osteoclast formation, influence hemopoiesis and/or participate in local inflammatory reactions of bone.\r"

In intact rats, this could have resulted from both fast negative feedback, due to the rate of rise of B during the stress in the PM, and delayed negative feedback, due to the high basal concentrations of B before the stress in the PM. However, this diurnal pattern of stress responsiveness was not dependent on B, as the same relative responses to restraint and ip injection were found in ADX rats. To determine whether the lack of response of ADX rats in the PM to stress was due to a loss of sensitivity to endogenous secretagogues, ADX rats were given CRF + arginine vasopressin (AVP) while anesthetized with ether after 30 min of restraint. In both the AM and the PM, the pituitaries were able to respond to exogenous secretagogues. A second novel finding was that in the PM, but not the AM, plasma ACTH concentrations in the ADX rats decreased substantially during the period of restraint, despite the lack of B-mediated negative feedback. In the AM and the PM, ADX rats were restrained for 30 min and then stressed with ether for 6 min. The ACTH concentrations were not different before and after ether, suggesting that, although the pituitaries of ADX rats are able to respond to exogenous CRF + AVP after stress, an additional stress of ether exposure no longer stimulates endogenous CRF and AVP release after 30 min of restraint at either time of day. After 90 min of restraint in the AM and the PM, the relationship between ACTH and B was positive, not negative, providing no evidence of ongoing B-mediated negative feedback in the SHAM rats. Therefore, the same mechanism responsible for the decrease in ACTH secretion in ADX rats may occur in SHAM rats as well. From these results, we conclude that the diurnal rhythm in stress responsiveness and, in the PM in the ADX rats, the decrease in plasma ACTH during stress, are largely independent of B.\r"

Food deprivation for a period of 24 h resulted in a 9.5 +/- 2.0-fold increase in hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance (P less than 0.001). An increase in circulating IGFBP-1 in sera from fasted rats was demonstrated by immunoblotting, and an increased abundance of a 30-kDa IGFBP in sera from fasted rats was apparent when [125I]IGF-I was used in ligand blotting experiments. Refeeding resulted in a prompt decline in hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA. Administration of insulin (0.5-4 U, ip) to fasted rats resulted in profound hypoglycemia, but either increased or had no significant effect on hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance. In contrast, administration of human GH (hGH; 100 micrograms, ip) resulted in a prompt decline in hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA, followed by a late rebound in IGFBP-1 mRNA to levels greater than those in fasted controls. Furthermore, hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA levels were significantly lower in hGH-treated (100 micrograms every 8 h) food-deprived rats than in saline-treated food-deprived rats (2.25 +/- 1.55- vs. 8.99 +/- 3.80-fold increase; P less than 0.005). Similar changes were observed when serum IGFBP-1 was quantitated by immunoblotting. The effects of GH could not be explained by secondary hyperinsulinism, since no significant increase in insulin levels was observed in GH-treated rats. From these observations we conclude the enhanced expression of IGFBP-1 in the food-deprived rat may be a consequence of GH deficiency rather than insulin deficiency.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of various doses of retinoic acid (RA) on the seminiferous epithelium in vitamin A-deficient rats has been studied. Although it was generally thought that RA was not able to reinitiate spermatogenesis in vitamin A-deficient rats, one injection of 5 mg RA strongly stimulated the proliferative activity of A-spermatogonia within 24 h, as evidenced by a 7-fold increase in the number of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled A-spermatogonia. Ten days after RA administration, B-spermatogonia or preleptotene spermatocytes were seen in most of the seminiferous tubules. After 15 days, zygotene spermatocytes were present. Hence, RA is able to induce a massive and synchronized development of A-spermatogonia into spermatocytes. When RA was given once, combined with a RA-containing diet, only few of the zygotene spermatocytes present on day 15 were able to develop into pachytene spermatocytes, which did not develop into spermatids. In subsequent epithelial cycles new B-spermatogonia and spermatocytes were formed, although in lower numbers than during the first cycle after RA injection. When RA was given once a week, the formation of B-spermatogonia and preleptotene spermatocytes continued at a higher level. Also, more pachytene spermatocytes were formed, some of which were able to develop into spermatids. Finally, when RA was injected twice a week, even more pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids were found after 36 days, and after 49 days elongated spermatids were found in all animals. It is concluded that RA, similar to retinol, is able to induce synchronous proliferation and differentiation of A-spermatogonia. When repeated injections are given, RA is able to support the full development of spermatogenic cells into elongated spermatids.\r"

The aim of this study was to determine whether this PRF was involved in the luteotropic PRL surges of early pregnancy. The posterior pituitary was removed from a group of rats at least 4 weeks before the experiment (LOBEX). LOBEX rats were tested for diabetes insipidus and checked postmortem for the absence of posterior lobes. Plasma samples were taken from these chronically LOBEX rats as well as from sham-operated and unoperated controls beginning at noon on day 3 of pregnancy and continuing for 3 days at times most likely to demonstrate the twice daily surges of PRL secretion. PRL in all groups was basal (less than 12 ng/ml) at noon and rose to a diurnal peak at 1800 h. While the unoperated and sham-operated controls then displayed a clear nocturnal surge of PRL, peaking at 300-400 ng/ml at 0300 h, LOBEX rats had a significantly attenuated peak of 102.7 +/- 17.7 ng/ml (P less than 0.001). On subsequent nights the nocturnal peaks were similarly attenuated in LOBEX rats, averaging 80.3 and 42.1 ng/ml on days 5 and 6, respectively. LOBEX rats all had normal sized litters, but lactation yields were depressed. These data support the hypothesis that the posterior pituitary secretes a potent PRL-releasing factor because its removal partially blocked the mating-induced nocturnal surge of PRL.\r"

We have studied the expression of PEA mRNA during thymocyte maturation by identifying the subpopulation of thymocytes that expresses PEA mRNA. PEA mRNA was induced in unfractionated murine thymocytes after in vitro activation of these cells with the T cell mitogen, concanavalin A (Con-A). A slight induction of PEA mRNA was seen after 48 h of Con-A stimulation; however, the maximal response occurred after 72 h of culture with Con-A. Two PEA mRNA bands were present in unfractionated thymocytes which had been cultured with Con-A for 48 and 72 h. The predominant band was 1.4 kilobases (kb), and a second band was approximately 1.7 kb. Fractionation of thymocytes into CD4, CD8, and double negative subpopulations showed that only the 1.4 kb PEA mRNA was inducible in the mature CD4 subpopulation. Induction required the presence of antigen-presenting cells in addition to CD4 thymocytes. Neither the 1.4 kb nor the 1.7 kb PEA mRNA was induced in the CD8 or double negative subpopulations. In contrast to the action of Con-A on murine thymocytes, PEA mRNA was not induced by this mitogen in murine splenic mononuclear cells at 24, 48, or 72 h. The regulated expression of PEA mRNA in murine thymocytes, but not in peripheral T lymphocytes, suggests a role for PEA mRNA and its peptides in thymocyte maturation.\r"

  ".U": "91114651\r", 
  ".W": "Two novel polypeptides known as pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide with 38 residues (PACAP38) and a shorter form of the peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 27 residues (PACAP27) were isolated from ovine hypothalamus. The N-terminal 28 residues of PACAP show 68% homology with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). VIP has been reported to have specific binding sites in lymphocytes and inhibit mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation through a receptor-mediated stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Using concanavalin A-induced proliferation of murine splenocytes as a model system, we now report that both PACAP38 and PACAP 27 can inhibit the proliferation of these cells in the same dose-dependent manner as VIP. The minimal effective concentration of the PACAPs was 10(-10)-10(-9) M. However, neither PACAP affected lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation of murine splenocytes. The binding of [125I]PACAP27 to these splenocytes was rapid, time dependent, reversible, and proportional to the numbers of murine splenocytes. Scatchard analysis of displacement of the bound tracer by unlabeled PACAP27 indicated the existence of two classes of binding sites. The dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.86 +/- 0.24 nM and the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) was 1.13 +/- 0.39 fmol/10(6) cells for the high affinity binding site. The low affinity binding site had a Kd of 0.13 +/- 0.03 microM with a Bmax of 73.5 +/- 9.5 fmol/10(6) cells. PACAP38 and VIP displaced the binding of [125I]PACAP27 in the same manner as PACAP27 and Scatchard analyses indicated the presence of two classes of binding sites with Kd and Bmax similar to those for PACAP27. Furthermore, when [125I]VIP was used as a radiolabeled ligand, PACAP27 and PACAP38 displaced the [125I]VIP binding to the same degree as unlabeled VIP. Scatchard analysis indicated that there was no significant difference of the Kd or Bmax between PACAP and VIP. Taken together, these data suggest that PACAPs bind to a site similar or identical to that used by VIP which inhibit the proliferation of murine splenocytes induced by concanavalin A.\r"

The location of binding sites for NPY in the pars intermedia of the pituitary has now been studied with light microscopic autoradiography, using a dispersed cell labeling method with the specific NPY receptor ligand [125I]Bolton-Hunter NPY. The majority of radioactive labeling was associated with folliculo-stellate cells; the percentage of labeling as well as the mean number of grains were approximately 5 times higher for folliculo-stellate cells than for melanotropes. An excess of nonlabeled NPY drastically reduced radiolabeling of folliculo-stellate cells, but had no effect on the degree of labeling of melanotropes. These results show that folliculo-stellate cells of X. laevis possess specific binding sites for NPY and indicate that NPY exerts its inhibitory action on the release of alpha MSH in an indirect fashion, by acting on the folliculo-stellate cells.\r"

As estrogens seem to have regional influence on adipose tissue, we have compared the effects of long term ovariectomy (3 weeks) on the membranous transducing system controlling lipolysis in two rat fat deposits, the femoral sc and the parametrial adipose tissue. These experiments demonstrate the following. 1) Compared to parametrial adipocytes, sc adipocytes have a reduced cAMP production and a decreased beta-adrenoceptor number associated with a reduced lipolytic activity. 2) In parametrial adipocytes, ovariectomy induces a decrease in cAMP production and in both the beta-agonist-stimulated response and the catalytic activity of adenylate cyclase in association with a decreased lipolysis. In contrast, these parameters are unaltered by ovariectomy in sc adipocytes. This study, which reveals site-related differences in the sensitivity of the fat cell adenylate cyclase system to ovarian status, suggests that these differences may explain some of the sex-related regional specificities of adipose tissue metabolism and distribution.\r"

In the present paper the intracellular signalling pathways involved in regulation of the secretion of immunoreactive (ir) beta-endorphin by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells are described. Activation of protein kinase-C with a phorbol ester rapidly induces secretion of ir-beta-endorphin by T-cells as well as by the non-T cell fraction. Stimulation of protein kinase-A by the addition of (Bu)2cAMP to T-cells or non-T-cells can also induce the secretion of ir-beta-endorphin by these cells. Investigation of the effect of different mitogens or antigen on ir-beta-endorphin secretion by lymphocytes revealed that the nature of the stimulus determines the kinetics of the response and the responding cell type. Induction of ir-beta-endorphin secretion by T-cells after stimulation with a T-cell mitogen is relatively fast; it can be observed within 3 h. In contrast, the response of the non-T-cell fraction to, for example, stimulation with (Bu)2cAMP can only be observed after 18 h of culture. Evidence will be presented that the fast response is mediated via protein kinase-C activation. The response observed after 18 h can be mediated via protein kinase-C as well as protein kinase-A activation.\r"

The NADP+ supply and, thus, NADPH oxidation are the limiting steps of the pentose phosphate pathway. The purpose of this work was to test the hypothesis that H2O2 generation is a limiting step of iodination and NADPH oxidation and, therefore, of the pentose phosphate pathway. H2O2 produced by dog thyroid slices was measured with the homovanillic fluorescence assay. Our data show that H2O2 generation is stimulated by both the cAMP cascade [as activated by TSH, forskolin and (Bu)2cAMP] and the Ca2(+)-phosphatidylinositol cascade (as activated by carbamylcholine, ionomycin, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate). We used several physiological and pharmacological agents that modulate iodide organification. In all cases there was a strict parallelism between effects on H2O2 generation, iodide binding to proteins, and pentose phosphate pathway activity. Moreover, in TSH- or carbamylcholine-stimulated slices, glucose or Ca2+ depletion, which greatly depressed H2O2 generation, also greatly decreased iodide organification and the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway. The glutathione peroxidase-catalyzed H2O2 reduction in the cytosol, which involves NADPH oxidation and, therefore, increases the NADP supply, also enhances the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway. All of these data strongly support the hypothesis that H2O2 generation in dog thyroid controls iodination of proteins; through the NADPH oxidation resulting from H2O2 production and reduction, hydrogen peroxide also regulates the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway.\r"

  ".W": "We determined whether tumor-promoting factor phorbol ester modulates cellular cAMP production and the cellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in response to arginine vasopressin (AVP) in rat renal papillary collecting tubule cells in culture. In the presence of 5 x 10(-4) M 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, AVP increased cellular cAMP production in a dose-dependent manner. A 1-h exposure to 3 x 10(-7)-3 x 10(-6) M phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) significantly attenuated the cAMP response to AVP (1 x 10(-9) M AVP; 474.9 +/- 24.8 vs. 368.1 +/- 22.8 fmol/microgram protein; P less than 0.01). The dose-response relation with AVP thus shifted to the right. Such an inhibition was totally reversed in the presence of 2 x 10(-6) M 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (H-7), an inhibitor of protein kinase-C. Also, 1 x 10(-7) M AVP produced an increase in [Ca2+]i from 99.4 +/- 3.3 to 200.0 +/- 8.6 nM. When cells were preexposed to 1 x 10(-6) M PMA, an increase in [Ca2+]i in response to 1 x 10(-7) M AVP was significantly diminished (75.5 +/- 4.6 to 101.4 +/- 4.3 nM). The inhibition by PMA of AVP-induced increment in [Ca2+]i was significantly attenuated in the presence of 2 x 10(-5) M H-7 compared to that in its absence. Prolonged exposure to PMA did not alter the AVP-induced increases in cAMP production and [Ca2+]i. These results indicate that phorbol ester inhibits the cellular action of AVP mediated through the activation of protein kinase-C and suggest that there is an interaction between cAMP and phosphatidylinositol systems in modulating the AVP action in renal papillary collecting tubule cells.\r"

  ".W": "This laboratory has previously demonstrated that PRL-secreting cells are virtually nonexistent on day 3 but appear in appreciable numbers on day 4 of neonatal life. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this explosive appearance of PRL cells is due to maternal influences specific to the first 4 days of lactation. Litters of 1-day-old rat pups were placed with foster mothers that had been lactating for either 1 or 4 days. Four days later (at 5 days of age), the anterior pituitaries from these pups were removed, dispersed into individual cells with trypsin, and subjected to reverse hemolytic plaque assays for PRL and GH release. We found that the proportion of PRL-releasing cells in pituitaries from pups placed with day 1 mothers (4.2 +/- 0.6%; mean +/- SE; n = 4 experiments) was similar to that in 5-day-old pups that had not been fostered (3.4 +/- 0.6%; n = 3 experiments). In contrast, placing 1-day-old pups with day 4 mothers significantly reduced (P less than 0.01) the fraction that released PRL to 0.6 +/- 0.2% of all pituitary cells (n = 4 experiments). This effect appeared to be specific to PRL cells, since the percentage of all pituitary cells that secreted GH was not different between litters fostered onto day 1 or day 4 dams (40.0 +/- 3.8% and 41.1 +/- 3.9%, respectively; n = 3 experiments). Furthermore, the suppression of PRL cell expression did not result from a gross nutritional deficit, since the rates of body wt gain during the foster period were not different between the two groups (12.4 +/- 0.5 and 12.9 +/- 0.8 g/litter.day, respectively; n = 4 experiments). In a second design, newborn pups were placed with females that had been lactating for 0, 2, 4, or 7 days and analyzed for PRL- and GH-releasing cells at 5 days of age. In two trials of this experiment, the fractions of pituitary cells that secreted PRL were 5.2, 6.3, 5.9, and 1.2%, respectively for trial 1 and 3.3, 4.1, 0.7, and 0.6%, respectively for trial 2. As in the first experiment, the proportion of GH-releasing cells and the rate of growth were not different among the four groups. Taken together, these results indicate that normal differentiation of PRL cells in neonatal rats is triggered by a maternal signal present during the first few days of lactation, and that the magnitude of this signal declines with the progression of lactation.\r"

  ".W": "Gonadotrophs are known to possess voltage-sensitive Na channels. We used two experimental systems, proestrous rat anterior pituitary tissue superfusion and 17 beta-estradiol-treated rat anterior pituitary cells in primary culture, to examine the effect of Na channel inhibition on LH secretion. We found that a blocker of voltage-sensitive Na channels, tetrodotoxin (TTX), significantly augments LHRH- and elevated extracellular [K+]-induced LH secretion 20-90%. The augmentation of LHRH-induced secretion was demonstrable for both experimental systems and was independent of the time of TTX exposure. These results differ from previous studies in which TTX was without effect or was found to inhibit LH secretion. These discrepancies may be explained, in part, by the demonstration that TTX augmentation requires relatively low TTX concentrations (10(-6)-10(-8) M) and is not demonstrable at higher concentrations, requires submaximal LHRH concentrations (10(-10)-10(-9) M), and requires exposure of cultured cells to 17 beta-estradiol. The site of TTX action could be either directly on gonadotroph voltage-sensitive Na channels or indirect via modulation of Na channels of a paracrine modulator of gonadotroph function. The mechanism by which TTX Na channel blockade augments secretagogue-induced LH secretion is unknown; however, the data are interpreted as favoring direct action of TTX on the gonadotroph, with Na channel blockade affecting a site or sites common to both LHRH and elevated extracellular [K+]. Whether the inhibition of Na channels is one of the several effects of LHRH-receptor interaction remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The measurement of serum insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) in serum is complicated by the presence of high affinity IGF-binding proteins. The accurate measurement of IGFs by radioligand binding assays requires that the interference from binding proteins be eliminated. Acid-gel chromatography, the standard method for removing binding proteins, is laborious and time consuming. Alternative methods for extracting serum IGFs include the use of HCl-ethanol treatment and reverse phase minicolumns. However, these methods are unsuitable for use with serum for some species, such as rat and sheep, due to incomplete removal of binding proteins. We developed a fast protein liquid chromatography size-exclusion chromatographic method for characterizing the presence of IGF-binding proteins in physiological fluids and used this method to systematically investigate different combinations of acids and organic solvents as potential extraction methods for IGFs. We developed and validated an improved extraction procedure that uses formic acid, Tween-20, and acetone. The new extraction method was used in conjunction with purified biosynthetic human IGF-II and a commercially available anti-IGF-II monoclonal antibody in the development of an improved RIA for IGF-II. The new RIA is sensitive (5.0 pg/tube), specific (IGF-I cross-reactivity, less than 1%), and reproducible [interassay precision (coefficient of variation), less than 9.2%). We measured the serum concentrations of IGF-II in adults and found a significant difference between normal subjects and individuals with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.\r"

  ".W": "The tissue distribution and developmental patterns of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) have not been investigated in rat tissues, primarily because of the lack of an efficient extraction method for IGF-II and a sensitive RIA. IGF-II was extracted from rat tissues by formic acid, and the extract was heated at an acidic pH and treated with acetone. The removal of binding proteins was demonstrated by fast protein liquid chromatography size exclusion column and the elimination of a dilutional bias in the RIA. Using rat IGF-II as standard, we optimized a RIA for the quantification of IGF-II in rat tissues. In adult rats, IGF-II was found in all 15 tissues examined, with the highest concentration in the pituitary, followed by kidney, seminal vesicles, intestine, and serum. This distribution is not only different from that of IGF-I, but also differs from that reported for IGF-II mRNA and IGF-II receptors, suggesting that the rates of synthesis and/or metabolism of IGF-II are tissue dependent. Developmentally, IGF-II levels fell postnatally in most tissues, a pattern similar to that of IGF-II mRNA and IGF-II receptor. This developmental pattern supports the hypothesis that IGF-II is important in early growth and development. A relatively homogeneous distribution was observed in the adult rat brain, a distribution also different from that reported for IGF-II mRNA. In the pituitary, the highest concentration was found in the posterior pituitary, followed by the intermediate and anterior pituitary. In conclusion, IGF-II is found in many tissues of adult rats. This observation supports an autocrine and/or paracrine roles for IGF-II.\r"

  ".U": "91114665\r", 
  ".W": "Evidence from physiological studies in rats shows that neuropeptide Y (NPY) has marked neuroendocrine effects on anterior pituitary function, and especially on LHRH and LH secretions. However, previous immunohistochemical studies in rats have revealed only scarce NPY-axons of medullary origin in the external zone of the hypothalamic median eminence, the common termination site of neuroendocrine adenohypophysiotropic systems. In view of this apparent contradiction, we used light microscopic immunohistochemistry to reassess the distribution of NPY in the hypothalamus of rodents of both sexes under physiological (estrous cycle in rats, pregnancy in rats, and lactation in both rats and mice) and experimental (gonadectomy in rats and adrenalectomy in both rats and mice) conditions with alterations of reproductive functions. We reasoned that such manipulations could induce changes in immunoreactivity in the NPY system involved in neuroendocrine regulation and would thus make it apparent to us. We show here that immunoreactivity for NPY and its carboxyterminal precursor-associated peptide are dramatically increased in the external median eminence of lactating female animals when compared to the other animal groups. This NYP-precursor-immunoreactivity is present, throughout lactation, in the tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (and therefore possibly dopaminergic) tubero-infundibular system. This immunoreactivity disappears rapidly from the median eminence after pup-removal. These observations suggest a role for NPY-precursor-derived peptides in the control of the suckling-induced PRL secretion and also demonstrate the chemical plasticity of the median eminence during a normal physiological event. Since in nonlactating animals and especially in normal cycling females NPY-precursor-immunoreactivity was detected in the system of medullary origin only, we conclude that, by exclusion, this system might be the one responsible for modulating gonadotropic secretion at the median eminence and/or pituitary levels.\r"

  ".W": "Dexamethasone, a potent synthetic glucocorticoid, has been shown to increase polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) and antigen-specific IgA antibody levels in serum. This response coincided with a decline in IgA and IgG levels in saliva and vaginal secretions after dexamethasone treatment. To investigate the mechanism(s) of glucocorticoid action responsible for the accumulation of polymeric IgA in serum, we undertook in the present study to determine whether dexamethasone alters the production of secretory component (SC). SC is the receptor responsible for transporting IgA from blood and tissues into bile and external secretions. Dexamethasone administered in vivo increased SC levels in serum in a dose- and time-dependent manner. When bile and saliva samples were analyzed, dexamethasone treatment increased saliva SC levels and the production rate of SC by the liver, but had a pronounced inhibitory effect on both bile and salivary levels of IgA. As judged by HPLC, the majority of SC in blood was associated with polymeric IgA and not with monomeric IgA. Immunoblots showed the presence of a 29/27K doublet band of SC in serum from control- and dexamethasone-stimulated rats. These findings indicate that the elevation of polymeric IgA levels in serum after dexamethasone treatment may be due to decreased clearance of IgA into bile. Further, it demonstrates that liver production rate of SC as well as saliva and serum SC levels increase with glucocorticoid treatment. This findings suggests that glucocorticoids, which are known to stimulate hepatocyte SC synthesis in vitro, increase SC levels in blood, possibly as SC fragments that are capable of binding polymeric IgA and retarding its clearance from blood to bile.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study the effects of stimulus deprivation on vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)- and alpha 1-adrenergically mediated amplification of VIP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP accumulation were examined. Dispersed pinealocytes were prepared from either Sprague-Dawley rats maintained for 2 weeks in a normal lighting schedule providing 14 h of light/day (LD cells) or from animals maintained in constant lighting (LL cells). LL treatment enhanced the VIP-stimulated cAMP response up to 2-fold, while reducing the peak VIP-stimulated cGMP by 70%. In LL cells, phenylephrine potentiated the VIP-stimulated cAMP response, but did not potentiate the VIP-stimulated cGMP response. Potentiation of the cAMP response to VIP can be produced in LD cells by treatment with agents that elevate intracellular Ca2+ (depolarizing concentrations of K+ or A23187) or an activator of protein kinase-C [14 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)]. LL treatment abolished the potentiating effects of K+ or A23187 on cAMP and cGMP responses in VIP-treated cells. In contrast, LL treatment augmented the PMA potentiation of VIP-stimulated cAMP response. The potentiation effects of PMA and K+ on the cGMP response in VIP-treated cells, however, were suppressed by LL treatment. To further investigate the involvement of postreceptor mechanisms, forskolin was used to stimulate pineal cAMP and cGMP accumulation. LL treatment had similar effects on the forskolin-stimulated cyclic nucleotide responses, with one exception. Depolarizing concentrations of K+ potentiated the forskolin-stimulated cAMP response while having no effect on the VIP-stimulated cAMP responses. These findings suggest that LL treatment results in a larger VIP-stimulated cAMP response, while its effect on the cGMP response is inhibitory. LL treatment appears to inhibit a step distal to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ which is of importance to the alpha 1-adrenergic potentiation of VIP-stimulated cAMP and cGMP responses.\r"

Although IGF-I has been shown to directly attenuate GH gene transcription, the relationship of IGF-I binding and action in the somatotroph cell remains unclear. Therefore, IGF-I binding and action were compared in two different pituitary cell lines both secreting GH. Recombinant human IGF-I attenuated GH secretion in GC cells by up to 70% after 48 h in a dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, IGF-I failed to suppress GH secretion in GH3 cells, a clonally related pituitary cell line. Binding studies showed that although the KD for IGF-I was similar in both cell types, GC cells contain 3-fold more IGF-I binding sites compared to GH3 cells, possibly explaining their resistance to IGF-I action. Nevertheless, both cell lines possessed abundant and similar binding sites for insulin. These results imply that the IGF-I signal for GH gene regulation is receptor-mediated and directly correlated with the number of pituitary IGF-I binding sites. Availability of pituitary IGF-I binding sites may therefore be important in determining the level of GH expression by the somatotroph.\r"

In this report the various pathways for androgen metabolism in primary cultures of rat ventral prostate epithelial and stromal cells were identified and characterized by in vitro whole cell assays, using HPLC. Confluent cultures of both cell types were incubated with supraphysiological concentrations (50 nM) of tritiated androgens (testosterone, 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha(and 3 beta), 17 beta-diols, and delta 4-androstene-3,17-dione), and the metabolites were analyzed at several time points over a 24-h period. The metabolism studies indicated that 5 alpha-reductase activity, the oxidative reactions of 3 alpha-, 3 beta-, and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases, and the reductive reaction of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase were expressed at significantly higher levels in epithelial cells compared to stromal cells. The reductive reactions of 3 alpha- and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductases were similar in both cell types. In contrast, stromal cells exhibited substantially higher levels of 6 alpha/7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. In addition, stromal cells were capable of metabolizing 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone directly to a new unidentified polar androgen metabolite (HO5 alpha-DHT). Overall, epithelial cells were approximately 29 times more capable than stromal cells of forming the biologically active androgen 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Conversely, stromal cells were more capable of forming biologically inactive polar androgen metabolites.\r"

To determine whether the low serum IGF-I concentrations are responsible for the stunted growth, we infused 4-week-old protein-restricted rats with recombinant human IGF-I (300 micrograms/day) or rat GH (200 micrograms/100 g body wt/day) by osmotic minipump for 1 week. Despite the normalization of serum IGF-I concentrations by IGF-I infusion, carcass growth was not stimulated. In contrast, growth of the spleen and kidney was enhanced (+45% and +28%, respectively). Serum IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), the principal carrier of IGF-I in the serum at this age, is decreased by 34% in protein-restricted animals and restored to normal by IGF-I infusion. Contrary to the selective effects of IGF-I on growth of protein-restricted rats, well nourished hypophysectomized rats infused with 150 micrograms/day recombinant human IGF-I showed a significant growth response, including carcass and organ growth and normalization of IGFBP-3 values. These responses indicate that our IGF-I preparation and mode of delivery were effective. We conclude that: 1) dietary protein restriction causes organ-specific resistance to the growth-promoting properties of exogenous IGF-I; 2) IGF-I mediates the stimulatory effects of growth hormone on IGFBP-3 synthesis; and 3) the absence of carcass growth in the presence of normal serum IGF-I concentrations during infusion of IGF-I suggests that the growth arrest that accompanies protein restriction is mediated in part by resistance to IGF-I.\r"

However, T is metabolized in the brain, and many of the central effects of T are mediated by its metabolites. The experiments reported here were designed to determine whether T affects OT receptor binding directly or through the action of its metabolites 17 beta-estradiol and 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone. Adult male rats were either sham operated or castrated and treated 1 week later with T propionate (TP), 17 beta-estradiol benzoate (EB), dihydrotestosterone benzoate (DHTB), DHTB plus EB, or oil. OT receptor binding was assessed autoradiographically using [125I]d(CH2)5[Tyr(Me)2,Thr4,Tyr-NH2(9)]OVT. In addition, seminal vesicle weights were measured as an index of androgenic activity. These experiments showed that TP and DHTB plus EB increased OT receptor binding in the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus to the levels in intact males. Treatment with EB alone partially reinstated binding to the levels in intact males, while DHTB treatment was without effect. Castrated males treated with either TP or DHTB had seminal vesicle weights comparable to those of gonadally intact males and greater than those of animals in all other steroid conditions, indicating that sufficient levels of circulating steroids were attained in these groups. These data suggest that the induction of hypothalamic OT receptor binding by T is the result of the combined actions of estradiol and dihydrotestosterone. However, the mechanism underlying this interaction is unknown.\r"

However, ovariectomy induces female beta-cell degeneration similar to that in the males. In contrast, castration or the presence of the testicular feminization mutation do not alter the course of the disease in males. Treatment of males and ovariectomized females with estrogen prevents the development of diabetes. These results suggest that testicular androgens and a functional testosterone receptor are not required for the increased susceptibility of male beta-cells to the effects of the Ras oncoprotein, and that the relative resistance of female beta-cells is mediated by estrogen. In addition, a genetic component of female beta-cell resistance to Ras is revealed by crossing the transgenic mice with C3HeB/FeJ mice, which results in a pronounced increase in the incidence of female diabetes.\r"

Both coherent signal and stochastic aspects of the time series were analyzed. Samples were collected at 2- and 15-min intervals in control rats and rats immunoneutralized against CRH. The individual and composite spectral distributions revealed significant structure at both the higher and lower ranges of frequencies studied, with multiple periodicities between 4-220 min in both groups. CRH immunoneutralization consistently reduced the amplitude by 82% and compressed the frequency distribution for waveforms with periods longer than 15 min by 23%. A systematic break in the slopes of the background continua occurred between 10 and 15 min in the 2-min time series. This break was unaffected by CRH immunoneutralization. Digital Fourier transform analysis of our ACTH time series suggests a system with a more complex high frequency structure than has previously been appreciated. Our analyses suggest a biological system with the following characteristics: 1) both a fast and a slow response to a fairly constant unspecified fast forcing; 2) the slow response is initiated by the fast response and represents an imperfect integration due to feedback processes; 3) CRH alters the ability of the fast forcing to elicit a slow response without altering the fast response or ACTH clearance; and 4) this alteration consists of both amplitude and frequency modulation in the signal output. This view of ACTH secretion suggests an adaptive and energy-efficient system.\r"

However, it is not clear whether PYY can be released in the absence of nutrients in the intestine or whether a physiological role exists for endogenous PYY in negative feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion by pancreatic proteases. In the present study we measured plasma PYY concentrations and determined the effects of anti-PYY serum during stimulation of pancreatic secretion by pancreatic juice diversion (PJD). The effect of SMS 201-995 (SMS; an analog of somatostatin), another inhibitor of pancreatic secretion, on regulation of PYY release induced by PJD was also investigated. Male Wistar rats equipped with pancreatic, biliary, duodenal, and jugular venous cannulas were studied 4-6 days postoperatively. After 90 min of basal collection, pancreatic juice was diverted for 4 h with or without infusion of SMS (2 micrograms/kg.h), given either iv or intraduodenally (ID). Plasma PYY concentrations were significantly increased from a basal level of 177 +/- 15 pg/ml to a peak level of 328 +/- 43 pg/ml 2 h after PJD. These increases in PYY concentration paralleled those in pancreatic protein and fluid outputs. Both iv and ID infusion of SMS during the first 2 h of PJD markedly decreased the plasma PYY concentration to 134 +/- 27 pg/ml and 156 +/- 19 pg/ml, respectively; the total incremental PYY release during 4 h of PJD was inhibited by 100% and 84% by iv and ID SMS, respectively. One milliliter of anti-PYY serum given iv significantly augmented the increment in protein and fluid output during PJD. These results suggest that endogenous PYY released by PJD may play a physiological role in negative feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion in rats.\r"

  ".W": "Insulinopenic diabetes mellitus in the rat is associated with reduced circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), resulting primarily from decreased IGF-I synthesis in liver and extrahepatic sites. Plasma GH levels in these animals are also suppressed, with loss of episodic secretion and decreased pituitary synthesis. Intrapituitary IGF-I has been postulated to exert local autocrine/paracrine negative feedback regulation on GH synthesis and secretion. The present studies were designed to examine regulation of pituitary IGF-I peptide content and gene expression in insulinopenic streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats compared to that in liver and testis. Serum IGF-I levels were reduced by 86% in STZ-diabetic rats together with reduction of IGF-I content in liver (53%) and testis (74%; all P less than 0.001 vs. control). Concomitantly, liver and testicular IGF-I mRNA levels were reduced by 90% (P less than 0.001 vs. control). Insulin treatment restored IGF-I peptide levels in serum, liver, and testis toward normal, with a partial but significant increase in liver IGF-I mRNA. In contrast, pituitary IFG-I peptide content increased by 69% in STZ-diabetic rats (P less than 0.001 vs. control), with no change in IGF-I gene expression. Insulin treatment completely reversed the rise of pituitary IGF-I peptide content. These results demonstrate a novel discordance in the regulation of IGF-I gene expression and peptide content between pituitary and other tissues in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Elevated IGF-I levels in the pituitaries of these animals may partly explain the suppressed GH synthesis and secretion seen in STZ-diabetic rats and provide further evidence for a potential autocrine or paracrine role of pituitary IGF-I in GH regulation.\r"

  ".W": "GH is first detectable in the fetal rat pituitary between gestational days 18 and 19. The reasons for the GH surge soon after birth and subsequent postnatal decline to adult levels remain unclear. We therefore determined whether GH gene regulation in the developing pituitary could be distinguished from adult rat somatotroph function. In primary cultures of fetal and neonatal rat pituitary cells, GH secretion was detected by the 20th gestational day. These cells were stimulated by GH-releasing hormone (GHRH), but not by T3 or the morphogen retinoic acid. The stimulatory effect of T3 (0.25 mM) on GH secretion was detected only on the 2nd neonatal day and was similar to that seen in mature rat pituitary cell cultures. GHRH (10 nM) treatment for 24 h caused a 5-fold induction of GH secretion in pituitary cells derived from 2-, 5-, and 12-day-old neonatal rats. The presence or absence of T3 in the culture medium did not alter the response to GHRH. In contrast, only 2-fold induction of GH was observed in adult male pituitary cells during the same time course. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 6.5 nM), the peripheral target hormone for GH, resulted in a modest (20%) attenuation of GH secretion from pituitary cells derived from 20-day-old fetuses. IGF-I, however, produced a 70% reduction in GH levels in adult male pituitary cells grown under similar conditions. The effects of IGF-I on adult pituitary cells grown in T3-depleted medium were blunted. Addition of T3 partially restored the responsiveness of these cells to IGF-I. The results suggest that the high circulating GH levels in the fetal and neonatal rat may be secondary to relative insensitivity of the immature somatotroph to the inhibitory actions of IGF-I in addition to enhanced responsiveness to GHRH compared with the adult rat pituitary. Relative thyroid hormone deficiency in the immature rat may be contributory to this early transient state of pituitary IGF-I resistance.\r"

  ".W": "The steroid hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] induces expression of the gene encoding calbindin-D28K, a protein involved in intestinal Ca2+ transport. Glucocorticoids stimulate intestinal development and function, and presumed interaction with 1,25-(OH)2D3 has been intensively studied. Most studies involved administration of high doses of glucocorticoids in vivo, which inhibits intestinal Ca2+ transport by an unknown mechanism. However, it is now known from studies of the duodenal organ culture model that low concentrations of glucocorticoids enhance 1,25-(OH)2D3-dependent calbindin-D28K biosynthesis and Ca2+ transport. High concentrations mimic the action of administered glucocorticoids in vivo, suggesting that a distinct pharmacological or toxic mechanism causes inhibition of Ca2+ absorption. This report further shows that dexamethasone (DEX) rapidly enhanced calbindin-D28K gene expression, that is de novo calbindin-D28K mRNA biosynthesis. DEX also markedly reduced the actions of RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors on calbindin-D28K gene expression, although no evidence for an action of DEX or 1,25-(OH)2D3 at the translational level was obtained. Ca2+ transport activity was highly correlated with calbindin-D28K concentration regardless of treatment. Washout permitted complete reversal of inhibition, verifying the specificity of inhibitor activity. These results appear to show positive contranscriptional regulation of calbindin-D28K gene expression by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and glucocorticoids. The use of this model should continue to clarify the interactive roles of nuclear-acting hormones on the Ca2+ absorptive mechanism and on complex physiological and pathological processes in general.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated thymosin beta 10 mRNA levels in the PMSG/hCG-treated immature rat ovary. Thymosin beta 10 mRNA was constitutively expressed as a single (greater than 600-nucleotide) abundant transcript in the immature rat ovary. Administration of a single dose (50 IU/rat) of PMSG to immature rats resulted in a gradual increase in steady state ovarian thymosin beta 10 mRNA content detectable as early as 12 h and maximal (2-to 3-fold stimulation above preinjection levels) 48 h after PMSG treatment. Ovarian thymosin beta 10 mRNA levels declined thereafter. In separate experiments treatment of PMSG (50 IU)-primed rats with hCG (25 IU) precipitated a dramatic (80%) inhibition of ambient ovarian thymosin beta 10 protein and thymosin beta 10 mRNA; both parameters remained suppressed for the duration of the hormone-induced pseudopregnancy (15 days). HPLC analysis also indicated the presence in the ovary of thymosin beta 4, a variant member of the same protein family; in general, ovarian thymosin beta 4 levels fluctuated in a manner reciprocal to that exhibited by thymosin beta 10. A luteolytic dose of prostaglandin F2 alpha (500 micrograms/rat) had little impact on ovarian thymosin beta 10 gene expression. These findings show that 1) PMSG stimulation of ovarian thymosin beta 10 biosynthesis involves increased expression of the thymosin beta 10 gene; 2) decreased expression of thymosin beta 10 is associated with luteinization, while increased thymosin beta 4 levels characterize this process; and that 3) thymosin beta 4 and beta 10 are coexpressed in this tissue and may play a significant but, as of yet, undefined role(s) in the ovary.\r"

  ".W": "Pulsatile LH secretion is driven by GnRH, the hypothalamic hormone that is lacking in the hypogonadal mutant mouse. Preoptic area grafts containing GnRH neurons correct many reproductive deficits in hypogonadal mice. In this study we evaluated the pattern of LH secretion in hypogonadal female mice with preoptic area grafts (hpg/POA) and in normal female mice. Normal females were ovariectomized at 10 weeks of age, and hpg/POA mice were ovariectomized 4 months after graft surgery. Three weeks later, all mice received intracardial catheters. The next day, sequential blood samples were obtained every 10 min for 4 h from the awake, freely moving mice. At ovariectomy, normal and hpg/POA ovarian weights were 8.6 +/- 0.9 and 7.1 +/- 1.2 mg, respectively. Significant LH pulses were detected in 9 of 10 normal mice and in 9 of 13 hpg/POA mice. Pulse frequency (normal, 0.86 +/- 0.13; hpg/POA, 0.61 +/- 0.13 pulse/h) and interpeak interval (normal, 81.7 +/- 20.3; hpg/POA, 93.2 +/- 24.0 min) were not significantly different (P greater than 0.2), but mean plasma LH levels (normal, 1.07 +/- 0.16 ng/ml; hpg/POA, 0.49 +/- 0.08 ng/ml; P less than 0.005) and mean LH pulse amplitude (normal, 1.92 +/- 0.53; hpg/POA, 0.63 +/- 0.28; P less than 0.05) were significantly lower in the hpg/POA mice. The lower mean LH level and LH pulse amplitude in ovariectomized hpg/POA mice are consistent with the inability of most of these mice to show increased LH secretion after castration. The findings indicate that preoptic area brain grafts are capable of supporting episodic LH release in the hypogonadal mouse and suggest the presence of a functional GnRH pulse generator in the majority of mice with grafts.\r"

  ".W": "Choriocarcinoma, a highly malignant neoplasm of trophoblastic origin, is remarkable for its marked degree of sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. We treated two cell lines derived from choriocarcinoma patients with two antineoplastic agents, methotrexate and hydroxyurea (HU), both of which cause nucleotide depletion and have been previously shown to be effective against choriocarcinoma, and found pleiotropic regulation of several genes. Three genes, hCG alpha-subunit, beta-subunit, and placental alkaline phosphatase, were all strongly induced by methotrexate and HU. Expression of c-myc, an oncogene associated with proliferation, was reduced to nearly undetectable levels by the drug treatment, while expression of beta 2-microglobulin, a component of the class 1 major histocompatibility locus, was unchanged. In addition, the mechanism of induction by HU of one of these genes, the hCG alpha-subunit gene, was found to occur at the level of transcription. The similar effects of methotrexate and HU, two mechanistically unrelated antimetabolites, on the induction of specific gene expression in choriocarcinoma cells suggest that these effects are due to nucleotide pool alteration, rather than specific ligand effects. Furthermore, the hCG alpha-subunit promoter contains a transcriptionally regulated HU-responsive element.\r"

Rats were prepared with chronic fistulas draining bile and pancreatic juice, which was collected and returned to the duodenum at all times. Six days postoperative rats were fasted overnight, and pancreatic protein and fluid secretion were monitored for 3 h under basal conditions (0.15 M NaCl, intraduodenally) and during 2 h of intraduodenal infusion of a 20% triglyceride emulsion (Liposyn). Solutions were infused at 4.6 ml/h. Rats received a single bolus injection of 0.1 ml antisecretin serum or normal rabbit serum starting in the second hour of the basal period, and the effect on basal and fat-stimulated pancreatic protein and fluid secretion was determined. Antisecretin serum significantly inhibited basal interdigestive pancreatic protein and fluid secretion by 43% and 36%, respectively. Infusion of 20% fat emulsion stimulated a 2.1-fold increase in pancreatic protein and fluid secretion. The stimulation of both protein and fluid secretion was significantly inhibited by 60% by antisecretin serum. Plasma secretin after 2 h of fat infusion was 17.7 +/- 1.8 pM and was greatly reduced by the presence of secretin antiserum. The results support the hypothesis that secretin released by fatty acids is an important mediator of the pancreatic protein and fluid secretory response to dietary fat in the rat.\r"

  ".U": "91114687\r", 
  ".W": "In plasma, glucocorticoids are transported by corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), which is synthesized primarily in the liver. Plasma levels of maternal and fetal CBG fluctuate during gestation, and this may be due to changes in the biosynthesis and/or clearance of the protein. We have, therefore, studied the ontogeny of CBG biosynthesis in the rat by using a solution hybridization assay to measure hepatic CBG mRNA levels. The results indicate that the concentration of CBG mRNA is exceptionally high in 15-day-old fetal livers (55.1 pg CBG mRNA/micrograms total RNA), but declines to very low levels at birth (day 21). During the same period, CBG mRNA levels in maternal livers remained relatively constant (18.9-23.1 pg CBG mRNA/micrograms total RNA). Hepatic CBG mRNA levels were barely detectable 1 week after birth, and a sex difference was apparent by 2 weeks of age, with higher levels in female livers. Although adult CBG mRNA levels were attained by 3 weeks of age, serum CBG concentrations did not reach adult values for an additional 3 weeks. To determine whether age-related differences in the clearance of CBG are responsible for this, CBG from infant or adult animals was radiolabeled and administered iv to infant and adult rats. When this was done, the half-life of CBG in infants (approximately 6.9 h) was consistently less than that in adults (approximately 14.5 h) regardless of the source of the labeled CBG, and we conclude that variations in CBG biosynthesis and clearance may influence glucocorticoid action during fetal and postnatal development.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of experimentally produced hypoprolactinemia and hyperprolactinemia on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA signal levels were examined in dopaminergic neurons ovariectomized rats. TH mRNA signal levels and relative TH quantity in the arcuate nuclei, zona incerta, and substantia nigra were evaluated by in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry, respectively. The catalytic activity of TH in the stalk-median eminence (SME) was determined from the in vitro rate of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation after inhibiting DOPA decarboxylase with brocresine. Chronic administration of bromocriptine (BROMO), a dopamine (DA) agonist, for 3 days reduced circulating rat PRL (rPRL) levels compared to those in the vehicle-treated controls. BROMO treatment decreased TH mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nuclei, the intensity of TH immunostaining in the arcuate-median eminence area, and the rate of DOPA accumulation in the SME. Concomitant administration of ovine PRL (oPRL) reversed the effects of BROMO on TH, resulting in markedly increased TH mRNA signal levels, intensity of TH immunostaining, and rate of DOPA accumulation. Treatment with oPRL by itself for 3 days increased TH mRNA signal levels in the arcuate nuclei and TH activity in the SME, compared to vehicle. Chronic treatment with haloperidol, a DA antagonist, increased circulating levels of endogenous rPRL and increased TH activity in the SME to values similar to those after oPRL treatment. However, in contrast to oPRL, mRNA levels in the arcuate nuclei of haloperidol-treated rats were similar to levels in vehicle-treated animals. To evaluate whether the effect of PRL on TH was species specific, oPRL or rPRL was continuously infused into the jugular vein using an osmotic minipump. TH mRNA levels in the arcuate nuclei were elevated above control levels by either oPRL or rPRL administration. TH mRNA levels in the DA perikarya located in the zona incerta and substantia nigra were not altered by treatment with a DA agonist, a DA antagonist, or PRL. These results indicate that hypoprolactinemia or hyperprolactinemia can selectively reduce or augment, respectively, TH mRNA levels in the tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic neurons. The alterations in TH mRNA content probably contribute to the decrease or increase in TH activity associated with hypoprolactinemia or hyperprolactinemia, respectively.\r"

Indeed, he is remembered primarily for the works that he composed in the last decade of his life. In this paper, Janacek's concept of aging is outlined in three areas: the subject matter of his late operas, the composer's own comments during this period, and the shape of his musical structures. The concept of \"the late style\" is questioned, and the problems of applying models to artistic creativity and productivity are noted.\r"

The Duchamp career speaks to issues of aging because over the span of an entire lifetime of 81 years there was no diminution of quality of innovation, theory, or power.\r"

Current awareness that psoriasis is, at least in part, a T cell-mediated condition has led to the initiation of several studies of cyclosporine's role in the treatment of this disease. The remarkable efficacy of systemically administered cyclosporine, even in severely refractory cases of psoriasis, has not only provided us with a new therapeutic option but also has helped further our understanding of the pathophysiology of psoriasis. Although it has been hailed as a breakthrough, systemic cyclosporine usage is associated with undesirable sequelae, principally hypertension and decreased renal function. These effects limit its more widespread use. This review assesses current knowledge of the capabilities and prospects of systemic cyclosporine in the treatment of psoriasis, as well as the status of topical preparations.\r"

Of six patients with oral bullous diseases treated with topical cyclosporine, four showed a decrease in erythema, partial healing of ulcerations, and a reduction in pain. Three patients relapsed shortly after cyclosporine was discontinued. Four of eight patients with persistent aphthous stomatitis remained virtually free of ulcers during 8 weeks of topical cyclosporine therapy.

  ".U": "91116068\r",

Measurements should be determined as trough levels in whole blood, not plasma or serum. The measurements should be performed with an assay that is specific for the parent cyclosporine compound (e.g., a high-performance liquid chromatography method or a specific monoclonal immunoassay). The results of nonspecific immunoassays that detect cyclosporine as well as its metabolites are difficult to interpret and cannot readily be compared among different studies or laboratories. In psoriasis patients, the circulating concentration of cyclosporine does not correlate reliably with the therapeutic response. Some patients may achieve an excellent response with blood levels in the range of 50 ng/ml; others may show little or no response despite blood levels as high as 200 ng/ml. In patients with a poor clinical response, monitoring of cyclosporine levels may be useful to confirm that the drug has been taken and may provide an estimate of the degree of absorption and metabolism of the parent compound. Because an upper limit of safety for the circulating concentration of cyclosporine has not been clearly defined, one should attempt to achieve a therapeutic response with the lowest possible dose. Clinicians must carefully monitor patients for signs of cyclosporine toxicity, regardless of the circulating concentration of the drug. Whole blood levels exceeding 250 ng/ml should be avoided.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclosporine is not cytotoxic but it inhibits the production of immunologic memory-building growth factors by CD4+ T lymphocytes. It also may have inhibitory effects on the effector phase of certain immune reactions. These inhibitory effects are largely reversible and when treatment is stopped, the immune competence of cyclosporine-treated patients returns to normal. In contrast, conventional cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents tend to exterminate the lymphocyte clones that are activated during therapy, and such clonal deletions may cause permanent loss of immunologic memory to those antigens because T lymphocytes are not readily restored in adults with involuted thymus. Most transplant patients have received cyclosporine in combination with various other immunosuppressive agents, and reports suggest that a combination of this drug and conventional immunosuppressive agents may be associated with increased early appearance of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, possibly, endocrine-related tumors. An increase in cancers has not been observed in patients treated with cyclosporine alone for such conditions as psoriasis and autoimmune diseases. Treatment of adults with cytotoxic immunosuppressive drugs may permanently delete T-lymphocyte clones that are required for control of latent oncogenic viruses or certain malignant cells. Because of this, when such patients are treated with cyclosporine, further suppression of T-cell function combined with impairment of cytokine-mediated stimulation of natural killer cells and cytotoxic macrophages may facilitate tumor growth. Consequently, it is predicted that if cyclosporine monotherapy is associated with an increased incidence of tumors, it would primarily affect psoriasis patients who are treated with cyclosporine after PUVA or methotrexate therapy. Eventually, comparison of cancer incidence in different categories of patients should resolve this issue.\r"

The significant differences found among patients in the daily dose of cyclosporine required to attain target blood levels has been attributed directly to corresponding interpatient differences in the catalytic activities of P-450 IIIA enzymes. Competitive inhibition or induction of P-450 IIIA activity appears to explain most of the clinically significant interactions of drugs with cyclosporine metabolism that have been reported. The critical importance of P-450 IIIA in the body's handling of cyclosporine has made it possible to identify potential drug interactions before they are reported. Future investigations in this field are likely to result in reduction in the cost and toxicity associated with cyclosporine therapy.\r"

Stimulatory and inhibitory factors interact to determine whether the immune response is regulated up or down. Normally, stimulatory signals are counteracted by inhibitory signals to prevent an immune reaction from being initiated. However, exogenous antigens and irritants or endogenous factors and altered immunogenic self-peptides can upset this balance. When that occurs, T cells are activated and an inflammatory skin reaction develops. Lymphokines released from such activated T cells can modify the phenotype and function of normal keratinocytes. They can induce the expression of adhesion molecules and receptors involved in antigen presentation. Furthermore, they can also stimulate keratinocyte proliferation. This may be important in development of the hyperplasia seen in inflammatory skin diseases, especially in psoriasis. Cytokines released from the activated keratinocytes can both stimulate and attract T cells to the epidermis and thereby continue the ongoing immune reaction.\r"

However, a direct activity of this drug on human keratinocyte signal transduction or growth has been difficult to demonstrate at relevant concentrations. Nevertheless, treatment of psoriasis or of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate-treated murine skin with cyclosporine does reverse many epidermal abnormalities that are common to these two systems. This suggests that the compound exerts an indirect effect on epidermal keratinocytes in vivo, perhaps through immunocyte inhibition. During treatment of psoriasis patients, cyclosporine therapy resulted in selective changes in the numbers and functions of certain antigen-presenting cell subsets (which were distinct from Langerhans cells) and T-cell subsets. These changes were accompanied by indirect evidence of decreased T-cell lymphokine release. Lesional activity of cyclosporine-treated psoriasis patients was closely correlated with the degree of T-cell activation caused by antigen-presenting cells. Cyclosporine inhibition of lymphokine or cytokine release may result in decreased recruitment of non-Langerhans antigen-presenting cells into the epidermis and thus decreased immunoreactivity in the lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Since cyclosporine was first reported to improve psoriasis, investigators have been trying to determine its mechanism of action. In addition to the well-documented effects on cytokine production by T lymphocytes, a direct effect on keratinocytes has been proposed. Cyclophilin and calmodulin, two proteins that are present in both lymphocytes and keratinocytes, have been considered as possible intracellular targets for cyclosporine. Cyclophilin binds cyclosporine with high affinity and the ability to bind cyclophilin correlates with the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine analogs. Cyclophilin is identical to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, an enzyme that catalyzes refolding of proteins. The process of protein folding may be important in DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. Calmodulin is an intracellular calcium-binding protein that is important in the regulation of cell proliferation. Cyclosporine binds to calmodulin with low affinity, and such binding of cyclosporine isomers does not reflect their immunosuppressive activity. The physiologic importance of calmodulin-to-cyclosporine binding is controversial.\r"

These models have proven to be particularly valuable in experimental bacterial meningitis, focusing on the bacterial virulence factors responsible for the initiation of infections, CNS invasion, and induction of SAS inflammation. Recent studies have examined the formation of host inflammatory cytokines in response to these virulence factors. These cytokines may be responsible for many of the pathophysiologic consequences of bacterial meningitis (eg. increased BBB permeability, cerebral edema, and increased intracranial pressure). Meningitis due to C. neoformans occurs most commonly in patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS), and the depletion of T helper cells in AIDS patients may allow unrestricted cryptococcal growth. Viral meningitis is an illness of low prevalence when compared with the overall occurrence of viral infections at other sites. CNS infection usually occurs by means of traversal across barriers that normally exclude viral invasion of the CNS, primarily through hematogenous dissemination from initial sites of infection. These advances in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of bacterial, fungal, and viral meningitis may lead to the development of innovative treatment strategies for these disorders.\r"

Analysis of the CSF abnormalities produced by bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections may greatly facilitate diagnosis and direct initial therapy. Basic studies of CSF that should be performed in all patients with meningitis include measurement of pressure, cell count and white cell differential; determination of glucose and protein levels; Gram's stain; and culture. In bacterial meningitis, Limulus lysate assay and tests to identify bacterial antigens may allow rapid diagnosis. Where there is strong suspicion of tuberculous or fungal meningitis, CSF should also be submitted for acid-fast stain, India ink preparation, and cryptococcal antigen; unless contraindicated by increased intracranial pressure, large volumes (up to 40-50 mL) should be obtained for culture. If a history of residence in the Southwest is elicited, complement-fixing antibodies to Coccidioides immitis should also be ordered. Newer tests based on immunologic methods or gene amplification techniques hold great promise for diagnosis of infections caused by organisms that are difficult to culture or present in small numbers. Despite the great value of lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of meningitis, injudicious use of the procedure may result in death from brain herniation. Lumbar puncture should be avoided if focal neurologic findings suggest concomitant mass lesion, as in brain abscess, and lumbar puncture should be approached with great caution if meningitis is accompanied by evidence of significant intracranial hypertension. Institution of antibiotic therapy for suspected meningitis should not be delayed while neuroradiologic studies are obtained to exclude abscess or while measures are instituted to reduce intracranial pressure.\r"

  ".W": "A high index of suspicion of meningitis is needed when evaluating neonates and young infants because clinical findings can be minimal and are often subtle and nonspecific. Analysis of the CSF constitutes the most effective method to document meningeal bacterial infection, although overlap with normal CSF values can occur, especially in newborns and very young infants. The introduction of highly active third-generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and their safety and efficacy in treating a broad array of bacterial pathogens that cause meningitis in all age groups has simplified selection of initial antibiotic therapy. In neonates, however, conventional antibiotic therapy with ampicillin and an aminoglycoside is appropriate because of its proven record of safety and efficacy, and because routine use of cephalosporins in the hospital nursery could lead to selection of resistant strains among gram-negative enteric bacilli. Despite the availability of modern intensive care management of infants and children with bacterial meningitis and the advent of potent antibiotics, case fatality rates and morbidity remain high. Because of this, recent research has focused on the complex interaction between bacteria and the host and on means to attenuate the meningeal inflammatory response. The clinical benefits demonstrated recently with the use of dexamethasone therapy in infants and children with bacterial meningitis underscore the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy to reduce audiologic and neurologic sequelae. Future studies of new methods to modulate meningeal inflammation such as the use of monoclonal antibodies directed against cytokines or of agents that interfere with leukocyte-endothelial interactions are indicated. The implication of routine H. influenzae type b immunization in young infants with the conjugated vaccines and optimal intrapartum prophylaxis against group B streptococcal disease in newborns will have an important impact on the incidence of meningitis in infants and children.\r"

  ".W": "In bacterial meningitis, several pharmacodynamic factors determine therapeutic success-when defined as sterilization of the CSF: (1) Local host defense deficits in the CNS require the use of bactericidal antibiotics to sterilize the CSF. (2) CSF antibiotic concentrations that are at least 10-fold above the MBC are necessary for maximal bactericidal activity. Protein binding, low pH, and slow bacterial growth rates are among the factors that may explain the high antibiotic concentrations necessary in vivo. (3) High CSF peak concentrations that lead to rapid bacterial killing appear more important than prolonged suprainhibitory concentrations, probably because very low residual levels in the CSF prevent bacterial regrowth, even during relatively long dosing intervals. (4) Penetration of antibiotics into the CSF is significantly impaired by the blood-brain barrier and thus, very high serum levels are necessary to achieve the CSF concentrations required for optimal bactericidal activity. Beyond these principles, recent data suggests that rapid lytic killing of bacteria in the CSF may have harmful effects on the brain because of the release of biologically active products from the lysed bacteria. Since rapid CSF sterilization remains a key therapeutic goal, the harmful consequences of bacterial lysis present a major challenge in the therapy of bacterial meningitis. Currently, dexamethasone represents that only clinically beneficial approach to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial lysis, and novel approaches are required to improve the outcome of this serious infection.\r"

The diagnosis of both leak and infection can be obscured by the patient's other injuries, and requires aggressive investigation of symptoms that suggest infection. Although the diagnosis is made with CSF cultures, when clinically suspected, treatment should begin after appropriate cultures have been obtained. Treatment should be directed against the most likely organisms, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and the other organisms common to the upper respiratory tract. There are no good indications for prophylactic antibiotic usage in patients with known CSF leaks. The patient with a shunt or other CNS prosthetic device may have various manifestations of infection, depending on the type of device and its termination. Frank meningitis or ventriculitis is not always present. Diagnosis requires direct culturing of the shunt milieu, with the most frequent isolates being staphylococcal species and gram-negative enteric bacilli. The most effective therapy, for both eradication of the infection and minimization of the duration and morbidity of therapy, involves removal of the infected shunt, external drainage during parenteral antibiotic therapy, and complete replacement of hardware at the time of internalization. The postsurgical patient will not develop meningitis very frequently, but like the posttrauma patient, concurrent factors can make the diagnosis difficult. Differentiating infectious from chemical meningitis must often be initially based on CSF cell counts and chemistries alone. Treatment to cover the most likely organism, staphylococcal species and respiratory flora, should be started before the culture results are finalized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Tuberculous meningitis is an uncommon but potentially devastating form of tuberculosis. Current antituberculous drugs are highly effective when treatment is initiated early, before the onset of altered mentation or focal neurologic deficits. Because the clinical outcome depends greatly on the stage at which therapy is initiated, early recognition is of paramount importance. Patients with the meningoencephalitis syndrome and CSF findings of low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and pleocytosis should be treated immediately if there is evidence of TB elsewhere in the body, or if prompt evaluation fails to establish an alternative diagnosis. Examination of CSF is the best diagnostic approach; with sufficient diligence, serial AFB smears and cultures will usually yield positive results, even days after therapy has been started. The CT scan is an important and highly effective tool for the diagnosis and management of patients with TBM. In a patient with compatible clinical features, the combination of basilar meningeal enhancement and any degree of hydrocephalus is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of TBM. Serial evaluation by CT scanning is useful for following the course of hydrocephalus and tuberculoma, particularly in reference to the need for, or response to, adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids and surgery. The decision to administer corticosteroids should be based on careful correlation of the clinical and radiographic features of the case. Surgical shunting should be considered early in the patient with hydrocephalus and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. Tuberculomas are best treated medically, often in conjunction with corticosteroids where cerebral edema is believed to contribute to neurologic decline. The recommended chemotherapy regimen is isoniazid and rifampin in all patients, together with pyrazinamide for the first 2 months.\r"

  ".U": "91116176\r", 
  ".W": "Fungal meningitis tends to be a subacute or chronic process; however, it may be just as lethal as bacterial meningitis if untreated. There are many similarities between the pathogenic fungi. Most of the fungi are aerosolized and inhaled, and initiate a primary pulmonary infection which is usually self-limited. Hematogenous dissemination may follow the initial infection, with subsequent involvement of the CNS. Rarely, trauma or local extension provides the route to CNS infection. The host is frequently, although not always, immunosuppressed. The hyphae of molds generally cause focal disease with hemorrhagic necrosis secondary to vascular thrombosis. The yeasts tend to cause a more diffuse process with the base of the brain being primarily affected, such that hydrocephalus is seen as a frequent complication of chronic disease. Diagnosis may be difficult, as the CSF may be normal, with negative smears and sterile cultures, although more often there is at least one abnormality indicating disease. Serologies (if available, depending on the fungus) may point towards the proper diagnosis, as may a careful travel history. Currently, amphotericin B is still the drug of choice in most situations; however, the newer azole antifungal agents offer great promise, especially in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis. The precise role of such agents will remain unclear until appropriate large-scale studies of their effectiveness have been completed. The treatment of the unusual CNS mycoses will continue to be based on clinical experience, and reports of the use of new azoles in these diseases need to be critically evaluated.\r"

Furthermore, beta-lactamase produced by other bacteria in the pharynx could potentially inactivate the penicillin, resulting in increased treatment failures or infection relapses. A study was undertaken to compare the efficacy of cefaclor, which is relatively resistant to inactivation by beta-lactamase, with penicillin for eradicating the group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal organism from the throats of 93 patients with pharyngitis. Additionally, extensive cultures for potential beta-lactamase-producing organisms were conducted on 37 patients; 27% of these had one or more pharyngeal organisms that were producing beta-lactamase. No statistically significant difference was found between the clinical responses or the bacteriological cure rates of those treated with cefaclor and those treated with penicillin when stratified by the presence or absence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms. The prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the pharynx, however, was increased after treatment with penicillin, whereas no change was noted following treatment with cefaclor.\r"

Comparisons were made with the data from a telephone survey conducted in 1986. Differences over time were analyzed. By 1988, the percentage of physicians treating or referring patients for possible AIDS had more than doubled in counties outside standard metropolitan statistical areas. The percentage of physicians reporting one or more diagnosed cases of AIDS had tripled, a finding that suggests the importance of AIDS in family medicine is increasing at a rapid rate. In addition, survey results indicate that a majority of those surveyed still lack the AIDS-related knowledge and competency necessary to effectively deal with AIDS.\r"

Results showed that, from pregnancy to the 6th postpartum month, the number of days that mothers were ill because of infections steadily increased. In addition, depressive symptoms for new mothers rose from pregnancy to the 6th week postpartum, and declined thereafter. For women who did not return to work during the period of the study, a significant decline in depressive symptoms was observed from the prenatal period through the 6th postpartum month. These findings demonstrate significant changes in mental and physical health for this group of first-time mothers.\r"

Primary care visits increased to offset these reductions only when gatekeepers were paid on a fee-for-service basis. Increased overall reliance on primary care physicians as opposed to specialists was also observed in the gatekeeper programs. Findings also indicate that enrolled beneficiaries received care from fewer sources than they had prior to enrollment. Although these changes in patterns of use have the potential to assure access to a more stable and structured system of care, the clinical and long-term economic consequences of such changes remain unknown.\r"

The present collaborative study of medical interviewing provided an opportunity to collect interviews from 550 return visits to 127 different physicians at 11 sites across the country. Tape recordings were analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System, and postvisit satisfaction questionnaires were administered to patients. A number of significant relationships were found between communication during the visit and the various dimensions of patient satisfaction. Physician question asking about biomedical topics (both open- and closed-ended questions) was negatively related to patient satisfaction; however, physician question asking about psychosocial topics was positively related. Physician counseling for psychosocial issues was also positively related to patient satisfaction. Similarly, patient talk about biomedical topics was negatively related to satisfaction, while patient talk regarding psychosocial topics was positively related. Furthermore, patients were less satisfied when physicians dominated the interview by talking more or when the emotional tone was characterized by physician dominance. The findings suggest that patients are most satisfied by interviews that encourage them to talk about psychosocial issues in an atmosphere that is characterized by the absence of physician domination.\r"

We have attempted to separate those circumstances when HPV testing may be useful in patient management and when it may not. Routine screening for HPV has not yet been shown to be useful. One must weigh informing 10% of patients that they have a potentially oncogenic virus against the ability of a repeat Papanicolaou smear to detect the lesion. On the other hand, HPV detection in the setting of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear and an acetowhite lesion that on biopsy lacks the histologic features of CIL does predict who is at high risk for CIL. HPV typing should not affect clinical management, and we do not recommend it. HPV detection by in situ hybridization is a very useful adjunct to histological analysis in genital tract lesions that are clinically suggestive of an HPV lesion but where the histological analysis is equivocal. This ability to distinguish true HPV lesions from its mimics is often crucial to the patient, given the implications of having a sexually transmitted disease.\r"

Assessment of these factors should be composed of two parts: (1) psychological factors and (2) psychiatric illness. Psychological factors include all those pain-associated alterations in the patient's environment that reinforce illness behavior. Psychiatric illness includes those syndromes that retard recovery from illness or injury, such as depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and dementia. Psychiatric and psychological interventions can be successfully introduced in the context of a comprehensive rehabilitation effort. Usually these interventions can be accomplished by the family physician in concert with a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist. In severely disabled or resistant patients, referral to a multidisciplinary pain clinic will be necessary.\r"

Some recent observers have additionally suggested the possibility that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the etiologic infectious agent in chronic fatigue syndrome, based on the finding of higher proportions of elevated antibodies to the EBV early antigen in some patients complaining of chronic fatigue. Straus et al reported on 23 patients with chronic fatigue, 83% of whom exhibited persistently elevated antibodies in modest titer to the early antigen. Ten of these patients had never fully recovered from an episode of acute infectious mononucleosis. Other studies had noted similar associations between persistently elevated antibodies to EBV-specific antigens and chronic symptoms in patients who presented with chronic symptoms after mononucleosis. Three important antigen complexes, demonstrable by immunofluorescence procedures, are expressed in EBV-infected cells. The early antigen is thought to function perhaps in early replication of viral DNA. A late antigenic complex, the viral capsid antigen, may represent, in addition to structural capsid proteins, components of the viral enzymatic machinery for late phases of replication or transformation. The Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen is felt to function in viral transformation of host cells.\r"

Results from children's symptom self-reports, as well as from teachers' ratings of children, indicated that children's symptom levels were at levels consistent with national norms. In contrast, parents' (especially mothers') ratings of children were significantly higher than national norms, as were parents' ratings of their own symptoms. Also, parents' own symptom reports showed somewhat stronger relationships with life stressors presumably affecting the child than did the children's and teachers' reports. Results suggest that parents' reports of children's symptoms may be mediated by the effects of military life stressors on the parents, but these stressors do not necessarily result in higher symptoms in the children. Overall results do not support the notion that levels of psychopathology are greatly increased in children of military parents. Further studies of military families should address the effects of rank and socioeconomic status, housing, and the current impact of life stressors on the parents as well as the children in order to avoid drawing erroneous conclusions about parts or all of the military community.\r"

This pilot study had the objective of dissecting the process of care in an attempt to understand outcomes for patients with major affective disorder and for their families. Twenty-four patients with a DSM-III diagnosis of major affective disorder were identified 12 to 18 months after hospital admission in three countries (Italy, Japan, and the United States). The patients, their families, and their doctors were interviewed separately and then together, using instruments measuring delivery of treatment (using an ideal treatment criteria set) and percentage of achievement of treatment goals. These measures were then (using parametric and nonparametric statistics) correlated with resolution of the index episode and the patient's global outcome (using the Global Assessment Scale). The data demonstrated that physicians delivered about half (52%) and, subsequently, achieved about half (54%) of what would be considered ideal care to patients and other family members. The mean resolution of the index episode at follow-up was only 3.0 (on a 0- to 5-point scale). There was a significant positive association between the most important outcome measure, i.e., the resolution of the episode, and the achievement of treatment goals for both the patient (p less than .07) and the family (p less than .005). Patients and families with the best resolutions received significantly more good treatment than those with the worst resolutions (p less than .02), most notably with regard to medication (p less than .002).\r"

  ".W": "From a sample of 2809 mood disorder patients hospitalized between 1913 and 1940, we selected for detailed study 914 patients with at least a 5 year follow-up and 103 patients who committed suicide within 5 years of discharge. Patients with clearly mood incongruent delusions or an onset associated with a physical illness were excluded. Based on the presence or absence of manic symptoms, this cohort of 1017 cases was divided into 297 bipolar and 945 unipolar patients. Bipolar patients had an earlier age of onset and admission and were more likely to be delusional and hallucinated. They also had more sudden onsets, more previous admissions, worse premorbid characteristics, and more problems with alcohol, but more patients were discharged as recovered. Unipolar patients were more often female and married, more likely to have made previous suicidal attempts, and more likely to have experienced a precipitating event. On a mean follow-up of 13.5 years, only 11% of the bipolar and 22% of the unipolar patients experienced no further episodes of mania or depression. Of the bipolar group, 77% had to be rehospitalized, as did 56% of the unipolars. Only 2% of the sample had manic episodes with no lifetime depressions; this small group had the best outcome. One third of all the patients were rated unimproved on follow-up. Thirteen percent committed suicide, usually within 1 year of discharge. Bipolar patients had the worst outcome, with 43% rated unimproved. The sample was split by odd or even case number and one half was used to construct a prognostic scale significantly correlated with long-term outcome. It was cross-validated on the other half of the sample with little shrinkage. Patients with non-drug-treated affective disorders hospitalized half a century ago were found to have polyepisodic illnesses with a frequently chronic course.\r"

  ".W": "Although many clinicians have long believed that personality pathology may interfere with the effectiveness of treatment of axis I disorders, until recently there were no empirical studies on the subject. This report reviews the recent literature with regard to the following questions: a) Does personality pathology predict negative outcome of treatment for axis I disorders? b) If so, are there specific personality traits or disorders that account for such a negative outcome? The literature review reveals a robust finding that patients with personality pathology have a poorer response to treatment of axis I disorders than those without such pathology. Specific axis I disorders reported on include DSM-III major depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Both inpatients and outpatients have been studied. There is too little literature to determine whether certain pathological personality traits are especially important, but there is enough to provide methodological guidance for future studies. Such studies should use standardized measures of personality and outcome, should match personality and nonpersonality groups on severity of the axis I disorder, and should be certain that axis I diagnoses are not confounded by axis II symptoms.\r"

Mean follow-up was 4.9 years. The disease was correctly diagnosed within 2 years of the onset in 80% of cases. Onset of symptoms peaked in the second and third decade in females and fell between 20 and 59 years in males. At first observation 87% of the patients had generalized MG. Maximal worsening was observed within 3 years in 77% of patients. At the last follow-up, 35% of cases were symptom-free (pharmacological remission 24%, remission without treatment 11%). The more severe the disease at the first observation and at the maximal worsening of symptoms, the lower was the proportion of remissions. Steroids were given in 54% and immunosuppressants in 18%. Thymectomy was performed in 72%, mostly in women, younger than age 40, and with generalized MG. Thymectomy seemed to improve the course of the disease, mostly in patients operated on shortly after diagnosis and those with generalized mild-to-moderate disease and with a normally involuted thymus. MG was lethal in 4% of patients, principally men, older than 40, in grade 3 or worse at first observation, with a short history of disease, and with thymona.\r"

Furthermore, at least one of the following accessory signs was present: dysarthria, extensor plantar response and echocardiographic evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Two peaks of onset age were evident at 6-9 and 12-15 years. Analysis of intra-family variation of onset age and absence of clustering of cardiomyopathy and diabetes did not suggest genetic heterogeneity. Peripheral nerve impairment was an early finding and showed slight further progression, whereas involvement of the cerebellar and corticospinal pathways appeared later and mainly accounted for the progressive worsening of the disease.\r"

The primers used were derived from the HTLV-I gag, env and tax genes. Amplified products were separated on agarose gels, blotted onto nylon membranes and hybridized to specific radiolabelled oligonucleotides. The sensitivity of amplification and hybridization was one copy of target DNA in 10(5) cellular genomes. None of the specimens was positive for HTLV-I sequences except the TSP probe. These negative data are all the more significant because brain material from MS patients was used in these studies. Our studies thus fail to support speculations that HTLV-I is involved in the aetiology of multiple sclerosis.\r"

In traumatic dissections aneurysms were common, significantly fewer aneurysms resolved or became smaller and fewer stenoses resolved or improved, whereas more stenoses progressed to occlusion. Traumatic dissections were more likely to leave the patients with neurological deficits. A significantly higher percentage of the patients with spontaneous dissections were asymptomatic at follow-up compared with the traumatic group.

Patients were excluded from the study if there was alcohol or drug abuse, fever and/or opportunistic cerebral infection. The parameters tested were postural tremor of the outstretched hands, most rapid voluntary alternating index finger movements (MRAM) and rise time of most rapid index finger extensions (MRC). Whereas tremor peak frequencies did not differ significantly in the patients and controls, MRAM and rise times of MRCs showed significant slowing in the patient group. Morphologically, the motor test performance of the HIV-infected patients was similar to that of patients with manifest basal ganglia disease (Parkinson's, Huntington's and Wilson's diseases). MRI scans of all patients were normal. It is concluded that in HIV-infected patients there is a very early subclinical central nervous system affection, especially of the basal ganglia, which is detectable with appropriate, quantitative motor function tests. These functional abnormalities precede the structural alterations in the MRI scans.\r"

The first scan showed decreased 123I-IMP uptake in the right frontal lobe. This abnormal image was regarded as the primary focus of his epilepsy on the basis of its regional agreement with focal epileptic discharges on EEGs. In the second scan, he showed normal imaging, while the third scan showed the same abnormal image as before, in the right frontal lobe. The frequency of his clinical seizures was almost unchanged during the intervals between scans and further EEGs recorded soon after each scan showed almost no changes in the basic activities and frequency of the epileptic discharges. Such fluctuations in SPECT brain imaging suggest that the severity of functional inactivation underlying the focal hypoperfusion image as an epileptic focus may fluctuate considerably in the interictal state with no relation to the clinical features of epilepsy.\r"

The chance of obtaining at least one abnormal EP was lower in patients with normal CSF-IG than in patients with abnormal CSF.

  ".U": "91116430\r", 
  ".W": "The sagittal split ramus osteotomy is probably the most frequently used procedure for correction of mandibular skeletal dentofacial deformities. Despite numerous improvements in the technique in the 30 years since the procedure was introduced, a number of troublesome complications still occur. These include unfavorable fracture during surgery, paresthesia, and relapse. The purpose of this study was to determine where fusion of the buccal and lingual cortical plates occurs in the upper mandibular ramus, as it is thought that placement of the horizontal medial osteotomy above the point of fusion (without any intervening medullary bone) may lead to unfavorable fracture during splitting. Forty-nine human mandibles were sectioned vertically at three locations perpendicular to the surface of the ramus and the occlusal plane. Measurements were made to locate vertically the point of fusion of the buccal and lingual cortical plates relative to the lingula and to the depth of the sigmoid notch. The point of fusion occurred between 7.5 and 13.3 mm above the lingula. Only 2% of mandibles had fusion at or below the level of the lingula in the anterior ramus, whereas in the posterior ramus, 6.1% of mandibles were fused at that level. At a level halfway from the lingula to the sigmoid notch, 20% of mandibles were fused in the anterior ramus, whereas in the mid- to posterior ramus, the incidence was as high as 39%. The location of the medial horizontal osteotomy should be at or just above the tip of the lingula. A higher level of cut may be associated with an increased difficulty in splitting or incidence of unfavorable fracture.\r"

Its usefulness was evaluated as a parameter for monitoring therapy as well as recurrence of the tumors. Mean values for serum IS in patients with cancer and patients without were 687 +/- 284 micrograms/mL and 464 +/- 153 micrograms/mL, respectively. Normal healthy controls had a mean value of 431 +/- 105 micrograms/mL, with the cutoff value set at 641 micrograms/mL (mean +2 SD). Patients without cancer who had a severe infectious disease showed conspicuously high serum IS levels, and these values were closely correlated with their C-reactive protein values. The positive rate of IS increased in all patients with oral cancer was 58%. The mean level of serum IS in cancer patients was significantly higher than that of the controls (P less than .01), and the level was found to be more elevated as the stage of the disease advanced (stage I to III, 48%; stage IV, 68%). Histologic analysis of the tumor cells in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) showed that the mean serum IS level of those who had poorly differentiated SCC was much higher (937 +/- 181 micrograms/mL) than that of patients with well-differentiated SCC (616 +/- 159 micrograms/mL). Patients who had recurrent or metastatic cancer, or those who died from the cancer exhibited marked elevation of the serum IS levels, whereas patients who remained free of cancer in the follow-up period showed significantly lower serum IS levels. The rise and fall of the serum IS level was closely correlated with the disease progression and/or remission. These data strongly suggest that serum IS is a useful parameter for monitoring the disease stage as well as the effect of therapy on patients with oral cancer.\r"

As much as possible, standardization of the operating procedure and environment, and of the preoperative and postoperative regimens was observed. After surgery, each case was followed to determine the absence or presence of signs and symptoms of alveolar osteitis. It was found that several factors seem to contribute to the development of alveolar osteitis; however, the most significant related finding was that the reason for the extraction, that is, whether the extraction was undertaken for therapeutic or prophylactic reasons.\r"

In 31 patients with a tumor of the parotid gland, ultrasound scanning detected the presence of the tumor. In determining the location of the tumor, the method is highly specific when it is localized in the superficial lobe (100%), and it is less specific when it is localized in the deep lobe of the parotid gland. Also, it is highly specific in determination of tumor size (96%). In two cases with retention cysts, the ultrasound findings also correlated with the histologic and operative findings. The results obtained show that ultrasound is a reliable diagnostic method for detection of pathologic changes in the parotid gland.\r"

Twenty minipigs received coralline HA blocks for augmentation of surgically created defects in edentulous mandibles. Each block was fixed with two titanium screw implants. Two types of porous HA blocks that differed in pore diameter were used. A high rate of HA loss occurred in the group of animals that had received the HA block with small pore sizes, and fractures of the block occurred in the vicinity of the titanium implants in 12 of the remaining 13 cases. Histologic examination showed that the HA blocks with larger pore size were homogenously penetrated by bone that extended into the central pores and even incorporated the dislocated block fragments. The titanium implants were in close contact with the newly formed bone in these blocks. Little contact between bone and implants was seen in the HA blocks with the smaller pore size. The results indicate that, with improved mechanical properties, a combined augmentation with porous HA blocks and screw implants may be useful in primary reconstruction of bone defects.\r"

Implants of 1) nonporous HA granules (HAG), 2) HA granules hand-mixed with bovine collagen (HACM), and 3) HA granules and purified fibrillar collagen in a preprocessed block (PFC-HA) were randomly placed in subperiosteal pockets created on the cranium and adjacent to the left/right mandibles of each rat. Six rats from each group were killed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postimplantation. Animals killed after 3 weeks showed sporadic bone proliferation and bone resorption, whereas those killed after 6, 12, and 24 weeks showed formation of new bone at the implant/bone interface. Contact of the implant with bone was a requirement for osteogenesis, but bone formed only into the basilar layers of the implants. The ID group showed the greatest inflammatory response as well as the greatest degree of osteogenesis at all intervals of time. The addition of collagen to HA appeared to reduce the inflammatory response. Specimens implanted with HACM showed the least inflammation of the three implanted materials in both ID and ND groups.\r"

  ".W": "From January 1977 to December 1988, 19 patients with biopsy-proven Paget's disease of the vulva underwent simple or radical vulvectomy at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center. All vulvectomy specimens were evaluated immunocytochemically for the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and low-molecular-weight keratins 8 and 18 (LMK), both in areas containing neoplastic cells and in histologically negative surgical margins. Neoplastic Paget's cells stained positively for CEA in all cases; they were positive for EMA and LMK in 18 and 17 cases, respectively. In all eight cases with underlying in situ or invasive carcinomas, CEA, EMA and LMK were localized in the underlying tumors as well. None of the histologically proven negative margins reacted for CEA, EMA or LMK on immunocytochemistry. CEA appears to be a valuable immunocytochemical marker for extramammary Paget's disease; EMA and LMK are also expressed by the majority of such cases. None of these markers, however, is of added value in identifying Paget's cells in surgical margins if those margins appear negative on routine hematoxylin-and-eosin staining.\r"

A weak ER reaction in the basal and parabasal layers was found in only 2 of 17 specimens of keratinizing squamous epithelium. However, no ER was found in any neoplastic tissue of the vulva or the adjacent stroma. The loss of ER in neoplastic cells could explain the clinical experience that antihormonal treatment of vulvar carcinomas produces no appreciable improvement.\r"

A review of the surgical pathology files from Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, from 1983 through 1987 identified eight cases of vulvar GCT. Five of the eight patients had more than one skin and soft tissue lesion. Two of the five had biopsy-proven multicentric GCT with a unique clinical course. One of the patients was a 32-year-old woman with multiple vulvar, lingual, laryngeal, bronchial and pulmonary GCT, necessitating multiple excisions and ultimately pneumonectomy. The second patient had multiple GCTs in the vulva and inguinal area and finally in both lungs, resulting in her death at age 39. No dependable microscopic features could be identified to distinguish benign GCT from its more aggressive variant. However, Feulgen DNA histomorphometry demonstrated aneuploidy in the patient with apparent lung metastases, whereas the tumors from patients with a benign course as well as from the patient with multiorgan involvement were diploid. In three of five patients who could be interviewed there was a history of soft tissue tumors in members of the family. The multifocal nature and possible familial component of GCT need to be explored further.\r"

Premenopausal and postmenopausal vaginal, vulvar and nongenital skin was examined. ER was demonstrated in some but not all of the nuclei of basal and suprabasal differentiated epithelial cells of the vagina. ER was seen in the fibroblasts and smooth muscle, but not in the vessel endothelium, of the underlying stroma. ER was demonstrated in epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts of the vulva and perineum, hair and non-hair bearing, but at a much lower frequency than in the vagina. Specific ER staining was not detected in the majority of skin specimens for extragenital sites. These findings have implications for the hormonal regulation of the vulva and for the use of estrogen cream in managing vulvar conditions.\r"

Twenty-six (87%) of 30 condylomas responded, whereas only 1 (11%) of the 9 cases of micropapillomatosis showed a partial response (P less than .001) to podophyllin and/or interferon. Twenty-six biopsies from condylomas in which sufficient DNA was available for analysis contained human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences that hybridized to an HPV 6 + 16 probe mix under nonstringent conditions. In contrast, HPV DNA sequences could not be detected in any of the nine cases of micropapillomatosis. Immunoperoxidase studies performed on these lesions failed to demonstrate viral capsid antigen. Thus, despite certain similarities in the clinical presentation and microscopic features of condylomas and squamous micropapillomas, it is not clear at present whether micropapillomas are HPV-related lesions.\r"

Fifty-one percent of the cases showed histologic changes suggestive of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection; the mean age of those patients was significantly lower than that of patients without HPV infection. In 15 cases of VIN, HPV DNA testing was performed with Southern blot hybridization; in three (20%) of those specimens HPV 16 episomal DNA was identified. Epithelial alterations surrounding the areas of VIN were found in 24 cases (40%)-23 squamous cellular hyperplasias and 1 lichen sclerosus. Different types of treatment were performed according to the different grades of VIN: medical therapy, diathermocoagulation, local excision, hemivulvectomy and total vulvectomy. Follow-up was possible in 52 cases, with a mean of 33 months (range, 3-98). Two cases of VIN I showed progression of disease over 12-24 months.\r"

One death was attributable to chemotherapy toxicity, and two patients died of intercurrent disease. The overall survival rate at 27 months was 33%.

One of seven patients had groin metastases, none died of cancer, and one of seven developed local recurrence in the vulva. The criteria of the clinically best suited model are tumor not situated on the clitoris and less than 4 cm in diameter, with only slight hyperchromasia.

The progesterone:estradiol ratio showed a similar pattern. We also investigated the effect of the ovarian steroids on the activity of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-phosphodiesterase (cAMP-PDE). Progesterone in pharmacologic doses inhibited the activity of the high-affinity enzyme as much as 72% and the low-affinity form as much as 34%. High-affinity phosphodiesterase from nonpregnant myometrium was the least sensitive to inhibition, and the enzyme from pregnant myometrium obtained from laboring women was the most sensitive. Low-affinity phosphodiesterase from nonpregnant myometrium was less sensitive to inhibition than enzyme from pregnant women with or without labor. The degree of inhibition of the low-affinity enzyme in the two pregnant groups was not different. The type of inhibition was competitive in both the high- and low-affinity forms. Estradiol at similar concentrations did not have any effect on the activity of the enzyme. Progesterone in part may exert its effect on the human myometrium by its effect on cyclic adenosine monophosphate-PDE activity and the metabolism of cAMP.\r"

Optimal therapy provides coverage against aerobes (both gram positive and gram negative and especially the Enterobacteriaceae) and anaerobes (especially the beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative species, such as Bacteroides). A variety of antibiotics provide the broad spectrum of activity needed for these infections, including clindamycin plus an aminoglycoside, cephalosporins and cephamycins, imipenem, extended-spectrum penicillins and the beta-lactam agents combined with a beta-lactamase inhibitor. The cephamycins--cefoxitin, cefotetan and cefmetazole--have been shown to have a high rate of clinical efficacy and bacteriologic response. The cephalosporins are usually used for prophylaxis at the time of obstetric and gynecologic surgery. The cephamycins have recently undergone extensive evaluation for prophylaxis and have demonstrated comparable microbiologic and clinical efficacy. A pharmacokinetic comparison of cefoxitin, cefotetan and cefmetazole points to cefmetazole as a cost-effective alternative to cefoxitin and cefotetan for both prophylaxis and treatment of pelvic infections.\r"

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains are more susceptible to cefmetazole, alone or in combination with fosfomycin, than to any other cephamycins, and cefmetazole is remarkably resistant to the beta-lactamases produced by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The incidence of adverse drug reactions is low (8.8% in the United States, 2.2% in Japan), and the drug has been demonstrated to have cost-containment potential.\r"

  ".W": "Physicians have evaluated the role of antibiotics in the prevention of perioperative infections since these drugs were discovered, but not until it was determined that antibiotics prevented staphylococcal wound infections in the animal model did surgeons consider their use for prophylaxis. In the 1970s, improved techniques in isolating and identifying anaerobic microorganisms and the unacceptably high incidence of infection-related complications convinced obstetricians to study, and ultimately accept, the use of perioperative antibiotic administration to prevent these infections. Recent progress has included refinement of the guidelines for patient selection and drug regimens. Although a single dose of an antibiotic given to the patient undergoing primary cesarean section has been demonstrated to be effective prophylaxis when administered after clamping the umbilical cord, this practice has not been widely accepted. With the discovery of cephamycins the role of these broad-spectrum antibiotics in obstetric and gynecologic surgery was investigated. One of the studies compared the efficacy of cefmetazole with that of cefotetan in preventing post-cesarean section infection. Eighteen patients in each group received a 2-g dose of one of the two drugs when the umbilical cord was clamped. Predetermined elevations in temperature were used to evaluate the presence of ensuing infections. Four subjects in each group developed some type of morbidity. Postoperative complications included wound infection, endometritis, bladder infection and cellulitis. Cefmetazole and cefotetan seemed equally effective in preventing post-cesarean section infections.\r"

Cefmetazole and cefonicid had similar activity against most of the aerobic organisms recovered, but cefmetazole was significantly more active against anaerobic gram-negative microorganisms. The patterns of regrowth of vaginal flora were similar in the two treatment groups. Patient demographic characteristics and surgical procedures were similar in both groups. The difference in primary prophylactic failure (e.g., cuff cellulitis) with the two study drugs (1 of 53 [1.9%] with cefmetazole and 2 of 28 [7.1%] with cefonicid) did not reach statistical significance, and the results were similar for the two routes of hysterectomy. Cefmetazole, at a dose of 1 g intramuscularly preoperatively, is a safe and effective agent for prophylaxis during hysterectomy.\r"

Three hundred eighty-four patients required an infrapopliteal bypass for critical lower extremity ischemia. Of these, 259 were excluded because a short vein bypass was performed or because the vein was considered inadequate. The remaining 125 patients had a randomized vein bypass, 63 reversed, 62 in situ. The two groups were similar with regard to risk factors, indications, graft dimensions, and outflow. Secondary patency at 30 months was similar for both techniques: reversed 67% +/- 9% (+/- SE); in situ 69% +/- 8%. For veins less than or equal to 3.0 mm in minimum distended diameter 24-month patency rates were 61% +/- 22% for 12 in situ veins and 37% +/- 29% for 10 reversed veins (p greater than 0.05). Angiographic evaluation of failing grafts revealed lesions similar in type and frequency in both types of grafts. These included focal (in situ, n = 4; reversed, n = 7) and diffuse vein hyperplasia (in situ, n = 2; reversed, n = 1), and inflow and outflow stenoses (in situ, n = 4; reversed, n = 3). The incidence of wound complications and the mortality rate were similar for the two groups. These data show no significant difference in overall patency rates for the two types of vein grafts at 2 1/2 years.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sites of stenosis included vein conduit (n = 41), anastomoses (n = 20), outflow arteries (n = 15), or inflow (n = 9) arteries. One hundred three secondary procedures consisting of vein-patch angioplasty (n = 31), sequential (n = 21) or interposition (n = 17) graft placement, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (n = 17), or excision of the lesion and primary anastomosis (n = 16) were performed to correct primary (n = 85) or recurrent (n = 18) graft stenoses. Cumulative graft patency after reintervention was 96% at 1 year, and 85% at 5 years. Stenosis or occlusion of revision sites was less after excision (0 of 16) or replacement (1 of 17) of abnormal segments compared to vein-patch angioplasty (8 of 31) or balloon angioplasty (9 of 18). Sequential or jump grafts constructed to improve graft outflow impaired by either myointimal or atherosclerotic occlusive lesions were the least durable secondary procedures. Five of eight graft failures in this series resulted from sequential/jump graft occlusion. All categories of secondary procedures normalized graft and limb hemodynamics, although only one third of patients reported symptoms of limb ischemia before revision. Surveillance of infrainguinal vein bypasses for occlusive lesions is a valid concept to salvage patent but hemodynamically-failing grafts. Secondary procedures that excised the lesion, used autologous tissue reconstruction, and normalized hemodynamics at the revision site and in the vein bypass were associated with a low incidence of restenosis and prolonged graft patency.\r"

Multiple criteria were used to identify patients with multilevel disease likely to benefit from multilevel procedures. The operations were performed by two operating teams in a median time of 240 minutes. Prosthetic grafts were used for eight (13%) distal bypasses, the remainder were autogenous vein. There was one operative death (1.8%). The mortality rate, morbidity rate, and operative time were not significantly different from a group of patients who underwent concurrent, isolated inflow operations (aortofemoral, axillobifemoral, femorofemoral bypass or iliac endarterectomy). Mean follow-up was 14.9 months (range, 0 to 120). The life-table primary patency for the inflow procedures was 92.6% at 24 months, the outflow was 94.9% at 24 months. Cumulative limb salvage was 90.9% at 48-month follow-up. All patients with claudication were relieved of their symptoms. We conclude that complete correction of multilevel disease can be accomplished with operative time, morbidity rate, and patency equal to that of single level repair. Multilevel procedures provide complete relief of symptoms in a higher percentage of patients than has been reported after single level repair.\r"

We reviewed our experience with hot tip laser-assisted balloon angioplasty in 99 occluded or stenotic arterial segments during 80 procedures in 71 patients, ranging from the aortic bifurcation to the tibial-peroneal trunk. Initial failure to successfully recanalize occluded or stenotic segments occurred in 13 instances (16%). Forty-one procedure-related complications occurred in 31 patients (39%). Functional results were evaluated by use of life-table methods on the basis of symptomatic versus hemodynamic improvement. Cumulative patency rates for symptomatic and hemodynamic improvement were 91% and 64% at 1 month, 71% and 48% at 6 months, and 57% and 34% at 1 year, respectively. These data suggest that symptomatic improvement alone gives a misleadingly high estimate of the efficacy of laser angioplasty when compared with more objective hemodynamic criteria (p less than 0.005). Hemodynamic success was more likely in aortoiliac lesions than femoropopliteal lesions (58% vs 18% at 1 year, p less than 0.01). Hemodynamic parameters should be used to evaluate the success of laser angioplasty, which in its present form, is associated with frequent complications and poor long-term success.\r"

Also included in this case-control study was an analysis of a randomized group of 82 patients from the same centers who had noninflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms. Four inflammatory aneurysms were ruptured, compared with 16 in the noninflammatory group (p less than 0.01). A higher proportion of patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms had symptoms that led to radiographic investigations. The median erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 39 mm versus 19 mm (26% of patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms had erythrocyte sedimentation rates greater than 50 mm; p less than 0.001), and the serum creatinine level was increased in 27 and 8 patients (p less than 0.01) in the inflammatory and noninflammatory groups, respectively. Preoperative investigations revealed ureteral obstruction in 19 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 12 had preoperative nephrostomy or ureteral catheter placement. At operation, 20 additional patients exhibited fibrosis around one or both ureters. Although ureterolysis was performed in 19 patients, preoperative and postoperative creatinine levels did not differ between these patients and the conservatively treated ones. Duration of surgery (215 vs 218 minutes), intraoperative blood loss (2085 vs 2400 ml) and complications did not differ significantly between the groups. Overall operative (30-day) mortality was equal (11% vs 12%) but was increased for patients undergoing elective surgery for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms (9% vs 0%; p = 0.03).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Ninety-six percent of these patients had a prehospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg. Management included paramedic field resuscitation and transport, an emergency department diagnostic protocol completed in an average of 12 minutes, rapid transport to a dedicated emergency operating room, aneurysmorrhaphy by general surgery chief residents under the supervision of specialist vascular surgeons, and skilled postoperative intensive care unit care. Nevertheless, 130 (70%) patients died in the first 30 postoperative days--3% in the emergency department, 13% in the operating room, 51% in the intensive care unit, and 3% on the ward or at home. Certain features--age greater than 80 years, female gender, persistent preoperative hypotension despite aggressive crystalloid and blood replacement, admission hematocrit less than 25, transfusion requirements exceeding 15 units--were associated with a greater than 90% likelihood of death. No patient with preoperative cardiac arrest survived more than 24 hours. From this experience we conclude that, although \"optimal\" prehospital, emergency department, operating room, and postoperative care can improve the outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms in shock, most such patients will die. Certain clinical features predict such excessive mortality rates after ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that withholding operation may be reasonable. Screening of patients at high risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm, followed by elective aneurysmorrhaphy, is clearly indicated.\r"

From July 1986 to December 1989, 33 patients (29 men, 4 women) with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent 45 operations. Twenty-eight patients had an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and five patients had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The abdominal aortic aneurysm ranged in transverse diameter from 3.0 to 8.5 cm (average 5.6 cm). Twenty-seven patients underwent a single operation, and six patients had two or more (range of 1 to 6). Operations performed were abdominal (13); cardiothoracic (9); head/neck (2); other vascular (11); urologic (7); amputation (2); breast (1). General anesthesia was used in 29 procedures, spinal/epidural in 6, and regional/local in 10. One postoperative death occurred from cardiopulmonary failure. One patient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at 20 days after coronary artery bypass (1/33 patients [3%]; 1/45 operations [2%]). Fourteen patients had repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysm at a later date, an average of 18 weeks after operation. Four patients had abdominal aortic aneurysm considered too small to warrant resection (average 3.6 cm). Four patients were considered at excessive risk for elective repair. The five thoracoabdominal aneurysm were not repaired. Four patients are awaiting repair. During this same 40-month period, two other patients, not known to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm after another operative procedure, at 21 days and 77 days.

To examine clinical features that facilitate recognition and allow successful repair, a 30-year experience with 20 such fistulas was reviewed. Fourteen fistulas were caused by aneurysm erosion, four followed iatrogenic injury during lumbar disk surgery, and two developed from abdominal gunshot wounds. The interval from presumed occurrence to diagnosis ranged from 3 hours to 8 years. The diagnosis was not recognized before surgery in five (25%) patients. Back pain (70%) was the most common symptom. The presence of a typical abdominal bruit (80%) was the most reliable physical finding, but its significance was occasionally overlooked or misinterpreted. Congestive heart failure was prominent in only seven (35%) patients. Severe lower extremity edema and mottling was the primary manifestation in eight cases, often causing initial confusion with venous thrombosis. Hematuria (5 patients) and oliguric renal failure (4 patients), both fully reversible after fistula repair, also caused diagnostic uncertainty. The mean preoperative cardiac output was 12.2 L/min, falling to 5.4 L/min with fistula repair. Mean blood loss was 5960 ml, supporting use of intraoperative autotransfusion. Two operative deaths (10%) occurred, both in patients not correctly diagnosed before surgery. Despite varied modes of presentation, prompt recognition and use of appropriate operative techniques should achieve successful repair.\r"

To determine the accuracy and clinical utility of intravascular ultrasonography, a flexible catheter-based system was used to generate two-dimensional, cross-sectional vascular images. In 23 arteries of 11 sheep 206 in vivo images demonstrated an echo-free lumen surrounded by three distinct concentric acoustic transitions corresponding to intima, media, and adventitia. Ultrasound measurements of lumen diameter and area correlated significantly with those of corresponding arteriographic measurements obtained by use of digital calipers (r = 0.91, r = 0.86). To evaluate clinical feasibility, intraoperative images (n = 160) were obtained in 10 patients undergoing vascular bypass or hemodialysis access procedures. The images depicted luminal configuration and arterial wall morphologic characteristics. Measurements of lumen diameter and lumen area correlated closely with corresponding intraoperative arteriography (r = 0.81, r = 0.79). The ultrasound images demonstrated arterial stenoses, intimal hyperplasia, intraluminal thrombus, polytetrafluoroethylene graft material, and anastomotic sites. We conclude that flexible catheter-based ultrasonography produces images that accurately demonstrate arterial wall architecture, lumen diameter, and area. Intraoperative application can produce images that provide unique information thus expanding the clinical potential of ultrasonography as a guidance system for vascular procedures.\r"

Fourier transfer analysis is performed on paired Doppler pulse volume recorder waveforms and an impedance score derived for the thigh and calf, respectively. In a retrospective review of 50 nonreversed femoropopliteal/distal grafts performed for limb salvage, postoperative biplanar intraarterial digital subtraction arteriography was compared with impedance analysis. Arteriography showed graft or runoff stenoses in 22 grafts (at risk) and 28 normal grafts (controls). Impedance scores were significantly higher in the at risk group (0.58 + [0.43 to 0.72]*), when compared with the controls (0.34 + [0.30 to 0.38], p less than 0.001*).

This score was then applied prospectively and compared with serial biplanar digital subtraction arteriography in a further 56 femoropopliteal/distal bypasses for limb salvage. Thirty-three of 34 lesions were successfully predicted and impedance scores were significantly higher in the at risk limbs (0.56 + [0.44 to 0.68]*) when compared with the controls (0.38 + [0.35 to 0.41], p less than 0.001*). In this series impedance analysis proved more sensitive than resting or stressed ankle pressures and, unlike Duplex scanning, was able to detect runoff as well as graft stenoses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The internal mammary artery is the preferred conduit for coronary artery surgery. To determine the role, if any, of preoperative duplex imaging in assessing the suitability of this vessel, preoperative noninvasive measurements of internal mammary artery diameter and blood flow were performed in 243 patients. The left internal mammary artery was insonated through the third intercostal space by use of duplex scanner (5.0 MHz probe) before coronary artery surgery. Internal mammary artery diameter (millimeters), peak systolic velocity (centimeters/second), and mean velocity (centimeters/second) were measured, and internal mammary artery flow was calculated from velocity and cross-sectional area. In 45 of these patients the internal mammary artery diameter also was measured during surgery with a sterile caliper, and blood was collected for 30 seconds from the transected internal mammary artery to measure flow. These findings were compared to the preoperative values. In 243 patients the mean internal mammary artery diameter was 2.34 +/- 0.03 mm, and mean peak systolic blood flow was 226.7 +/- 6.3 ml/min. In the 45 patients in whom intraoperative measurements were obtained, preoperative mean internal mammary artery diameter was 2.39 +/- 0.05 mm and was not significantly different from the intraoperative mean internal mammary artery diameter of 2.36 +/- 0.04 mm. Preoperative peak systolic flow was 231.3 +/- 8.1 ml/min, and mean flow was 110.3 +/- 7.1 ml/min; intraoperative flow measured 136 +/- 3.6 ml/min. Noninvasive determinations correlated with operative findings for internal mammary artery diameter (r = 0.87) (p less than 0.05), peak systolic blood flow (r = 0.70) (p less than 0.05), and mean blood flow (r = 0.60) (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fewer than 25% of patients with aortic aneurysmal disease undergo aortic angiographic evaluation at our institution. A prospective clinical study was undertaken to assess the validity of this policy. One hundred patients with clinical or ultrasonographic evidence of aortic aneurysms were evaluated prospectively during the period July 1987 to December 1989. All patients underwent CT scanning as an initial evaluation. Patients were selected for angiography if they fulfilled any of the following criteria: radiographic evidence of thoracoabdominal or juxtarenal aneurysms, or horseshoe kidney; or clinical suggestion of renal artery stenosis, mesenteric arterial insufficiency, aortoiliac occlusive disease, or lower extremity aneurysmal disease. During this period 19 patients (19%) underwent both CT scanning and angiography. The indications for angiography were thoracoabdominal aneurysms (7), juxtarenal aneurysms (2), clinical evidence of mesenteric insufficiency (1) or renal insufficiency (2), evidence of lower extremity aneurysmal disease (3), or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease (4). Eighty-one patients (81%) underwent CT scanning as the only radiographic evaluation. No patient was adversely affected by elimination of angiographic evaluation. CT scanning revealed inflammatory aneurysms (4), retroaortic renal veins (2), and horseshoe kidney (1). This study suggests that most (81%) patients with aortic aneurysmal disease can be adequately evaluated by CT scanning, and that a very selective policy of angiographic evaluation is indicated.\r"

We used magnetic resonance imaging to study 37 patients who had undergone recent renal angiography. Fourteen patients had normal renal arteries by angiography. In 23 patients either unilateral or bilateral stenosis or occlusion was present. The disease process in all patients appeared to be atherosclerosis. The average age of the 37 patients was 68 years. The magnetic resonance scans and angiograms were read independently by two different radiologists, each of whom was blinded to the clinical history and the results of the other study. Renal arterial stenoses found on angiogram and magnetic resonance scans were graded as absent (0% to 24%), mild (25% to 49%), moderate (50% to 74%), or severe (75% to 99%). The magnetic resonance imaging results concurred with the angiographic findings in 70 of 77 arteries (91%). Magnetic resonance imaging predicted the presence of a greater than 50% stenosis of the renal artery with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 94%. Magnetic resonance imaging may prove to be the best noninvasive screening test for proximal atherosclerotic renal arterial stenosis.\r"

Mean arterial pressure, back pressure, and internal jugular vein pressure were measured. Cerebral perfusion pressure (back pressure-jugular vein pressure) and the collateral to hemisphere vascular resistance ratio, (ratio = [arterial pressure-back pressure]/[back pressure-jugular vein pressure]) were calculated. A shunt was used when cerebral perfusion pressure less than 18 mm Hg. Back pressure accuracy was confirmed by test occlusion of the internal carotid artery distal to the plaque. Initial back pressure values were falsely high in 83 (12.5%) carotid endarterectomies. The mean SD (n = 665, mm Hg) were arterial pressure = 84.0 +/- 9.06, back pressure = 41.0 +/- 15.9, jugular vein pressure = 6.2 +/- 3.9, cerebral perfusion pressure = 35.1 +/- 5.7, and resistance ratio = 1.85 +/- 1.44. Perfusion pressure was less than 18 mm Hg in 82 (12.3%), of which 74 (11.1%) were shunted, and 8 (1.2%) had perfusion pressure increased greater than or equal to 18 mm Hg during carotid endarterectomy with phenylephrine. Back pressure was less than 25 mm Hg in 107 (16.1%), less than or equal to 25 in 114 (17.1%), and less than 50 mm Hg in 481 (72.3%). Pressures were continuously monitored during 28 carotid endarterectomies, and all had a positive linear relationship between arterial pressure and back pressure, and minimal variability in the back pressure/arterial pressure and resistance ratios.

After percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty each patient was examined by a surgeon, and then a color-flow duplex scan of the groin was obtained. On the initial scan eight pseudoaneurysms, three arteriovenous fistulas, one combined arteriovenous fistula-pseudoaneurysm, and one thrombosed superficial femoral artery were detected for a major vascular complication rate of 9%. Pseudoaneurysm formation was associated with the use of heparin after removal of the arterial sheath. Seven pseudoaneurysms (initial extravascular cavity size range 1.3 to 3.5 cm) were followed with weekly duplex scans, and all thrombosed spontaneously within 4 weeks of detection. The three patients with isolated arteriovenous fistulas were each followed for at least 8 weeks, and the arteriovenous fistulas persisted. Early surgical intervention for postcatheterization femoral pseudoaneurysms is usually unnecessary as thrombosis often occurs spontaneously. We would advocate an operative approach for pseudoaneurysms that are symptomatic, expanding, or associated with large hematomas. Iatrogenic femoral arteriovenous fistulas should be considered for elective repair, but this may be delayed for several weeks without adverse sequelae.\r"

  ".W": "We have explored the effect of arterial hemodynamics on endothelial cell morphology and low-density lipoprotein metabolism in human saphenous vein segments harvested from tissue donors. An arterial pulsatile perfusion system was used to impose physiologic pressures and flows for 20 hours on saphenous vein and companion (control) femoral artery segments. A venous perfusion apparatus was also employed for the perfusion of a second (control) saphenous vein segment for the same period of time. Calculations of fluid shearing and wall tensile stresses were performed and related to induced changes in endothelial cell geometry and cytoskeletal actin organization and the incorporation, degradation, and localization of intact low-density lipoprotein within the vessel wall. Our results indicate that, compared with native arteries and veins, a 20-hour exposure of test saphenous veins to arterial hemodynamics induced (1) a significant increase in endothelial cell luminal surface area and perimeter independent of alignment with flow, (2) disassembly of the dense peripheral band of actin with a concomitant assembly of stress fibers, and (3) a two- to fourfold elevation in the undegraded low-density lipoprotein content, localized primarily within the subendothelial intima. Although the exact mechanisms underlying these results are uncertain, the focal accumulation of intramural low-density lipoprotein may be related to the loss of normal barrier function during endothelial cell enlargement, which is accompanied by transient cytoskeletal reorganization during the adaptation to arterial flow.\r"
