Only six families were uninformative for any of the DNA polymorphisms. The remaining 49 families can be offered prenatal screening. No obligate recombinations between any of the polymorphic loci and the retinoblastoma phenotype were observed. Four previously unknown cases of non-penetrance were identified. Prenatal testing for the inheritance of mutant alleles was performed in two cases and perinatal screening in two additional cases. One fetus inherited the normal allele from the affected parent and is therefore not at risk of retinoblastoma; the second fetus inherited the mutant allele and will require frequent screening for early detection of retinoblastoma. Both perinatal tests showed the absence of the mutant allele.\r"

Red cell volume was measured either using dilution of autologous fetal haemoglobin with donor adult haemoglobin, or with a new technique using biotin as a red cell label. The two techniques give similar results. Mean (SD) values before transfusion were 27.4 (13.3), and after transfusion 45.0 (13.7) ml/kg. Cardiac output was measured using imaging and Doppler ultrasonography, and fell with transfusion from mean 286 (121) to 251 (95.6) ml/kg/min. The red cell volume before transfusion correlated well with changes in cardiac output following transfusion, infants with a red cell volume before transfusion of less than 25 ml/kg showing a fall in cardiac output, and those with a red cell volume of greater than 25 ml/kg not showing a significant fall. There was no correlation between haemoglobin concentration, packed cell volume, or change in packed cell volume with changes in cardiac output after transfusion. A red cell volume of 25 ml/kg seems to be critical in preterm infants with anaemia, and infants with values below this are those most likely to benefit from transfusion.\r"

In two of these units there is a policy of reducing the amount of artificial light in the low dependency areas at night, and in these the normal mean illuminance was 50 lux. We have measured the general levels of illumination to which a neonate might be exposed; the ocular exposure to light of a neonate depends, however, on both physical and biological factors and more research is required before an accurate estimate can be made.\r"

Headspace and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis of air from the newly constructed houses and from hydroxide-degraded casein revealed the presence of amines in the 0.003-0.013 ppm range and the presence of ammonia and sulfhydryl compounds, all of which in low concentrations can cause the symptoms observed.

These findings are consistent with aldicarb sulfoxide (ASO) illnesses that have occurred in other states. Aldicarb appears to be more toxic than previously suspected.

Specifically, a forced-choice method was compared to a method-of-limits procedure. The method of limits was found to be as reliable as the forced-choice procedure and required less time to administer. The second study was undertaken to determine the magnitude of major effect modifiers on vibrotactile thresholds. Vibration thresholds were determined using a method-of-limits procedure in 131 blue-collar workers who were 29-76 y of age. Equations relating vibrotactile threshold estimated by the method-of-limits procedure to age and height are presented for the upper and lower extremities.\r"

Similar deficits have been reported by other researchers. Unlike other studies, we did not find a significant excess of cancer of any site. Given the healthy worker effect and the small numbers of incident tumors at some sites, the Standardized Cancer Incidence Ratios that were over 100 in value (i.e., lip, melanoma of the skin, prostate, multiple myeloma) merit further investigation.

Six of 12 patients with a previous diagnosis of IPF and a Si/S ratio greater than 0.3 had an exposure history that could imply inhalation of silica/silicates, and the correct diagnosis for these patients is most probably pneumoconiosis.

If this does not occur spontaneously, air can be introduced into the subarachnoid space through a lumbar spinal catheter to produce forced dissection of the suprasellar cisterns and collapse of the tumor capsule (\"pumping technique\"). This method permits complete removal of the neoplastic tissue. In a series of 124 transsphenoidal operations for tumors with suprasellar extension, spontaneous descent of the capsule occurred in only 26 cases. Forced dissection using air distension of the cisterns was carried out in 88 cases, with complete success in 56 cases, partial success in 20, and no effect in 12. There were no complications or unwanted side effects in any patient.\r"

Coronary perfusion pressure and other variables were compared in patients with and without return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Twenty-four patients had ROSC. Initial CPP (mean +/- SD) was 1.6 +/- 8.5 mm Hg in patients without ROSC and 13.4 +/- 8.5 mm Hg in those with ROSC. The maximal CPP measured was 8.4 +/- 10.0 mm Hg in those without ROSC and 25.6 +/- 7.7 mm Hg in those with ROSC. Differences were also found for the maximal aortic relaxation pressure, the compression-phase aortic-to-right atrial gradient, and the arterial PO2. No patient with an initial CPP less than 0 mm Hg had ROSC. Only patients with maximal CPPs of 15 mm Hg or more had ROSC, and the fraction of patients with ROSC increased as the maximal CPP increased. A CPP above 15 mm Hg did not guarantee ROSC, however, as 18 patients whose CPPs were 15 mm Hg or greater did not resuscitate. Of variables measured, maximal CPP was most predictive of ROSC, and all CPP measurements were more predictive than was aortic pressure alone. The study substantiates animal data that indicate the importance of CPP during cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To provide an independent evaluation of seven day weighed dietary records, which are currently accepted as the most accurate technique for assessing habitual dietary intake in studies investigating the links between diet and health. DESIGN--Subjects who had previously participated in the Northern Ireland diet and health study were reselected by stratified random sampling to represent the range of energy intakes in the study as assessed by the seven day weighed dietary record. SETTING--Northern Ireland. SUBJECTS--31 Free living adults (16 men and 15 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Energy intake as measured by the seven day weighed dietary record and total energy expenditure estimated concurrently by the doubly labelled water technique. RESULTS--Average recorded energy intakes were significantly lower than measured expenditure in the group overall (9.66 MJ/day v 12.15 MJ/day, 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 3.53 MJ/day). Among those in the upper third of energy intakes the mean (SE) ratio of intake to expenditure was close to 1.0, indicating accurate records (men 1.01 (0.11), women 0.96 (0.08]. In the middle and lower thirds the ratios for men were only 0.74 (0.05) and 0.70 (0.07) respectively and for women 0.89 (0.07) and 0.61 (0.07). CONCLUSIONS--These results show a serious bias in reporting habitual energy intake. If substantiated they may have wide implications for the interpretation of many nutritional studies.\r"

DESIGN--Semistructured postal questionnaire survey; the questionnaire was enclosed with a letter to explain the purpose of the study and to give patients some information about hormone replacement therapy and osteoporosis. SETTING--Mixed social class, urban general practice with 12,000 registered patients. PATIENTS--All women aged 50, 51, or 52 were selected from the age-sex register; 102 women were identified and 84 (87%) replied to the questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response rates to questions on interest in taking hormone replacement therapy, the importance of preventing osteoporosis, and worries about side effects of the treatment. RESULTS--More than three quarters of the respondents (65) were interested in taking hormone replacement therapy to prevent osteoporosis, but 48 of them would have liked further information. Sixty four women thought that it was very important to prevent osteoporosis. More than half of the respondents (51) were worried about side effects of the treatment, but only 15 women thought that continued menstruation would be a major disadvantage. CONCLUSIONS--There is considerable interest among perimenopausal women in taking hormone replacement therapy to prevent osteoporosis. The resource implications for primary care in meeting this interest are substantial.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-five episodes of central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis developing in 43 of the 329 AIDS cases seen at our institution were diagnosed during a 34-month period and were prospectively studied. Acute episodes were treated with a pyrimethamine/sulfadiazine (P/S) combination for a mean of 21 days. Because of a previously known major allergy to sulfonamides, three episodes were treated with clindamycin instead of sulphadiazine. In those patients who accepted maintenance therapy, a combination of P/S or pyrimethamine and clindamycin (P/C) was administered 2 days per week. Thirty-six patients (83.7%) survived the first episode. Four of these 36 were lost to further study. Six of the 12 (50%) who decided not to undergo maintenance therapy relapsed (mean follow-up: 12 months). Fourteen patients were given P/S and none relapsed while they were on maintenance therapy (mean follow-up: 10.3 months). Six patients received an intermittent maintenance treatment with P/C and one relapsed 2 months after starting the maintenance therapy (mean follow-up: 13.7 months). We conclude that an intermittent (2 days per week) maintenance treatment for CNS toxoplasmosis with P/S was effective in preventing relapses, although prospective randomized studies remain to be done.\r"

Most cases occur in patients with serologic evidence of prior exposure and therefore appear to result from reactivation of a previously acquired infection. Antibody to Toxoplasma gondii was found in 130 out of 411 patients with AIDS (32%). Of these, CNS toxoplasmosis developed in 31 (24%). By survival analysis, the estimated probability of ever developing CNS infection in antibody-positive individuals was 28%, occurring in 26% of patients within 2 years of the onset of AIDS. All patients with HIV infection should be tested for antibody to T. gondii and monitored for any neurologic change. Methods of prophylaxis for CNS toxoplasmosis in these high-risk patients need to be developed.\r"

  ".W": "Human monolayer cells of various origins were shown to be susceptible to infection by HIV-1, HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus obtained from African green monkeys (SIVagm). Immunoperoxidase staining revealed infection of 2-7% of the monolayer cells, although in order to achieve infection approximately 50-fold more virus was necessary than with CD4(+)-permissive lymphoma cells. No CD4-receptor antigen expression by fibroblastoid cells was detectable by immunofluorescence using several monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), although a low level of CD4-specific messenger RNA expression was revealed by Northern analysis (with the exception of Tera-1 and RD cells). Attempts to block viral infection by anti-CD4 MAbs indicated a CD4 receptor-mediated mechanism for all lines tested except RD cells. We conclude that a low level of CD4-receptor expression is sufficient to allow infection of fibroblastoid cells. The infectability of a CD4-negative cell line indicates a second pathway of cellular infection, possibly mediated by a cellular receptor distinct from the CD4 molecule.\r"

A total of 220 methadone-clinic patients without evidence of HIV-related illnesses were given baseline psychological screening tests, as well as serological testing for HIV antibodies. At baseline, 83 (38%) had antibodies to HIV and 137 (62%) did not. On initial testing, controlling for race/ethnicity, age, sex and drug use, the seropositives were more cognitively impaired than the seronegatives. The differences were statistically significant for three subtests on univariate analysis: finger tapping (dominant), digit span (forward) and similarities. Ninety-one patients whose current serological status was known were given follow-up neuropsychological and psychosocial assessments after a mean interval of 7.4 months from baseline testing. At follow-up, seropositives continued to be more cognitively impaired than seronegatives, but there was no deterioration in the performance of the initial seropositives over the time interval.\r"

Current blood transfusion practices were assessed in 1044 patients for whom staff physicians had requested a transfusion between 5 September and 19 October, 1988. Children under 5 years of age with malaria, and pregnant women with acute anaemia requiring blood transfusion were the two highest risk groups. Many of the transfusions were given without an obvious medical indication; 22.7% (214 out of 955) of the recipients were transfused without prior laboratory tests [haemoglobin (Hb) or haematocrit (Hct)], 7.2% with Hb greater than 6g/100ml or Hct greater than 25% and 16.6% without clinical signs of severe anaemia (pulse less than 100/min without shortness of breath). The data of this study were used to organize a workshop for all the physicians responsible for blood transfusions in Kinshasa and two nearby health zones. A consensus statement on the indications for blood transfusion was developed. Subsequently, transfusion centres adopted this consensus statement instead of previous guidelines.\r"

The isolate recovered from a typical zoster lesion before acyclovir, and one obtained from a hyperkeratotic lesion 2 months later, after intravenous and oral acyclovir, were sensitive to acyclovir and produced normal amounts of thymidine kinase. In contrast, virus recovered from lesions 5 months after the onset, when the patient had received repeated courses of acyclovir, was acyclovir-resistant and thymidine-kinase-deficient. Resistance to acyclovir was associated with persistence of lesions which failed to improve with intravenous acyclovir, but was not associated with new lesion formation.\r"

HIV-antibody testing also benefits those who are tested, since people who find that they are seropositive can receive closer medical follow-up, and, in certain cases, medical treatment. However, debates continue about appropriate testing policy. This study concerns the conditions under which people who are currently seeking anonymous testing at an alternative test site would be willing to obtain testing. On self-administered questionnaires all sexual orientation/gender groups expressed reluctance to obtain testing if anonymity were not assured. Bisexual men were especially concerned about seeking testing if there was mandatory reporting. Believing that one was infected with HIV was slightly associated with a decreased inclination to obtain testing under non-anonymous circumstances.\r"

In AIDS patients this transmission delay did not increase further. Instead, the latency prolongation took place proximal to T12. We assume that myelopathy is an integral part of HIV infection that it is asymptomatic in the early disease phase, spreads from the lumbar part the spinal cord in a rostral direction and leads to the development of leg weakness and ataxia during the later stages of the disease.\r"

The complete response rate was 59% (29 of 49), including 67% (eight of 12) with low-grade and 57% (21 of 37) with intermediate-grade disease. The median survival for the entire group was 81 months. The 29 complete responders had a long median survival of 131 months. Forty-five percent (13 of 29) of the complete responders, 27% of the entire group, continue in remission with a median disease-free survival of 76 months. This includes five of 19 patients with diffuse poorly differentiated lymphoma, a disease generally characterized by early relapse. Twelve patients achieved a partial response and had a shorter median survival of 53 months, whereas nonresponders survived a median of less than 5 months. Late relapse was noted in patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade disease. Age (younger than or older than 60 years) was the only predictor of long-term survival. These data indicate very long disease-free survival can be achieved in low-grade and intermediate-grade lymphomas after attaining a complete remission. Intensive doxorubicin containing chemotherapy can be considered as an option for patients with advanced low-grade lymphoma but can only be proven to be superior to single-agent chemotherapy or no initial therapy by controlled randomized trails.\r"

  ".W": "The chemotherapeutic treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck (H & N) has a very dismal prognosis, with survival usually not exceeding 1 year. Reported objective response rates vary between 3% and 70%. This difference appears largely attributable to the heterogeneity of the patient populations included in most published Phase II studies in H & N cancer. They usually include together initially metastatic, recurrent, and post primary treatment metastatic disease patients. These patients respond differently to chemotherapy. Because of this situation, we decided to study a more homogeneous patient population consisting of metastatic patients only. Cisplatin (CDDP) and vindesine (VDS) are active agents in H & N SCC. As VDS has a cycle-specific activity, the therapeutic index may be increased if it is administered in a continuous infusion (CI) schedule. Thirty-three patients with metastatic H & N (69% biopsy proven) were treated with a combination regimen including CDDP (100 mg/m2) day 1 and VDS 0.6 to 1 mg/m2 for 96 hours of CI. Thirty-one patients were evaluable for response: five had a complete response (CR; 16%) and 11 had a partial response (PR; 36%) with an overall rate response of 52% (95% confidence limit: 33% to 70%). Median duration of CR was 6.4 months (3 to 19 months) and 4.4 months for PR (3 to 6 months). A decrease in the leukocytes was the main toxicity encountered with this regimen. This combination regimen containing CDDP and CI VDS was well tolerated and active in H & N SCC. The incorporation of an active vinca-alkaloid in neoadjuvant regimens should be considered.\r"

Regional and systemic side effects were minimal and temporary except in two patients in whom some skin discoloration has remained. Local tumor control and 5-year cures depended on two important factors: whether follow-up mastectomy was used after initial local tumor regression; and whether the carcinoma was classified as \"inflammatory\" with pathologic evidence of tumor invasion of dermal lymphatics. Of 16 patients with noninflammatory carcinoma treated by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and mastectomy local tumor eradication was achieved in 15 and 5-year apparent cure in 11. Of six patients with noninflammatory carcinoma treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy but no mastectomy 5-year local control was achieved in only three and 5-year apparent cure in three.

Nausea and vomiting, WHO Grades I and II, were observed in 46% of all patients. Alopecia, Grades I and II, was seen in 47% and Grade III in 6%. No signs of cardiac dysfunction were detectable, except for cardiac arrhythmia in four patients (11%). Pirarubicin is an active drug in the treatment of pleural mesothelioma with fewer severe side effects than doxorubicin.\r"

  ".W": "Sixteen previously treated (with only one prior regimen) patients with histologically proven metastatic or locally recurrent colorectal carcinoma were treated with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) administered by 30-minute i.v. infusions twice daily for 5 consecutive days every other week for 8 weeks. Patients received 100 micrograms/m2 twice daily on day 1 of cycle 1 with escalation to 150 micrograms/m2 twice daily thereafter. Patients were concomitantly treated with indomethacin 25 mg every 6 hours and acetaminophen 650 mg every 4 hours to obviate fever and chills. Toxicities included: nausea/vomiting (69%), headache (25%), chills (69%), pain at tumor sites (63%), hypotension (31%), and hypertension (38%). Hematologic toxicity included leukopenia less than 2000 cells/mm3 (38%) and thrombocytopenia less than 100,000 cells/mm3 (13%). Liver function abnormalities occurred independently of the site or extent of metastatic disease and inconsistently in each treatment cycle. Four patients developed bilirubinemia greater than 2.5 x baseline values (range, 2.5 to 10.3 U/L); five patients had greater than 2.5 x elevations in alkaline phosphatase (range, 624 to 1663 U/L). Two patients developed retinal vein thrombosis in the absence of hemostatic abnormalities. In both instances, this complication occurred several weeks after completion of therapy. No objective responses were noted in 14 evaluable patients (95% confidence interval: 0 to 0.23). Three patients had stable disease for a median duration of 4.5 months. In conclusion, i.v. rTNF at this dose and schedule has no demonstrable antitumor efficacy. Twice-daily i.v. administration of this agent is associated with more hepatotoxicity than previously reported in trials using subcutaneous or once daily i.v. administration. Retinal vein thrombosis may be a late complication of i.v. rTNF at this dose and schedule.\r"

  ".W": "Preclinical data suggest synergy of interleukin-2 (IL-2) combined with alpha-interferon (IFN). In addition, toxicities of IL-2 may be decreased by intermittent continuous infusion. The purpose of this trial was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of recombinant IL-2 combined with alpha-IFN in patients with renal cancer, colon cancer, melanoma, and malignant B-cell disease. IL-2 was given by continuous i.v. infusion at an initial dose of 5 X 10(5) units (U)/m2/d for 4 days plus IFN at 6 X 10(6) U/m2/d intramuscularly days 1 and 4 weekly for 4 weeks. Patients who achieved a response or stable disease received an additional 4 weeks of therapy. IL-2 doses were increased to 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 X 10(6) U/m2/d with three to eight patients at each dose level, at each of the two participating institutions. The dose of IFN was 6 X 10(6) U/m2 days 1 and 4 for all but five patients whose IFN dose was doubled to 12 X 10(6) U/m2/d. Forty-three patients were entered on this study with 34 completing at least 4 weeks of therapy. Six patients were taken off study because of Grades III or IV pulmonary, neurologic, or cardiac toxicity; one for progressive disease; one for CNS metastases, and one for personal reasons. All of the toxicities were reversible. Chills and fever were universal, especially on days 1 and 4. Mild and moderate nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, and cutaneous erythema were present in most patients. Fluid retention and occasional pleural effusions were observed at the higher IL-2 doses but were not dose-limiting. Significant hypotension associated with oliguria was seen, and these patients were treated with vasopressors and colloids. None of the patients required ICU admission. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for response. There were 4/18 (22%) renal cell patients who experienced a partial response. No responses were seen in patients with melanoma, lymphoma, or colorectal cancer. The combined debilitating symptoms of fatigue, diarrhea, hypotension, fluid retention, and anorexia defined the MTD as 5 X 10(6) U/m2/d of IL-2 and 6 X 10(6) U/m2 of alpha-IFN.\r"

  ".U": "90352496\r", 
  ".W": "The authors evaluated suppressed in vitro functions of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) as a possible tool in the early diagnosis of human lymphoma. In 13 of 22 patients with recent onset of various types of nonleukemic lymphomas (Mb. Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-cell and T-cell origin) the mitogen response of PBL against phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin A (Con A), as measured by 3H-thymidine (3HTdR) uptake, was found to be significantly suppressed, whereas the response to pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was normal in 18 cases. In parallel, cytofluorimetric analysis was done with PBL after 72 hours in culture with and without PHA, using antibodies against the differentiation antigens: CD3, CD8, CD4, CD19, and CDw14 and the activation antigens: interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor (IL-2R, CD25), human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR), and transferrin receptor (TR). Compared with healthy controls and patients with other diseases, a significant reduction of the total T-cell blast response, i.e., the percentage of large T-cells bearing activation markers, was found in all lymphoma cases including those with a normal 3HTdR uptake. Furthermore, a pronounced inhibition in the expression of the activation markers Il-2R and TR, but not of HLA-DR, was detected on CD3+ cells in PHA-stimulated PBL of all lymphoma cases. Thus, polyclonal activation combined with activation antigens seems to give more accurate information about the functional defect(s) of PBL in an early state of lymphoma; these parameters may therefore be valuable diagnostically. The abnormal pattern in the expression of T-cell activation antigens after polyclonal stimulation may help in the understanding the cellular immune defects associated with lymphoma.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of 11 chemotherapeutic agents on superoxide anion (O2-) production were examined in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). All drugs, except predonine, were found to suppress O2- production in PMNL. Adriamycin (doxorubicin), mitomycin C, vindesine, cisplatin, etoposide, nimustine, and pepleomycin suppressed O2- production at relatively low drug concentrations, whereas methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil and vincristine suppressed O2- production at high drug concentrations. Time-dependent suppression of O2- production was evaluated in four drugs, namely Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), cisplatin, vindesine, and methotrexate. Only Adriamycin showed suppressive effect on PMNL-derived O2- production in a time-dependent manner. Production of O2- by PMNL is a fundamental element for its bactericidal activity. The authors' results showed suppression of O2- production in PMNL in the presence of chemotherapeutic agents. This indicates a relationship between chemotherapy drugs and susceptibility to infection. The influence of chemotherapeutic agents on O2- production by PMNL should thus be taken into consideration when assessing defense mechanisms and susceptibility to infection of patients treated with these drugs.\r"

The frequency and distribution of Type IIB IM were similar, irrespective of the disease, when age of the patient was matched and if the extension of the IM was similar. Type IIB IM was usually observed in the mucosa along the lesser curvature of the lower portion of the stomach, particularly in elderly patients and was mainly located in the deeper foveolae and intermingled with or transient to those in other types of IM. These findings suggest that a casual relationship between Type IIB IM and intestinal type carcinoma is dubious.\r"

The beta-HCG-positive cells were located mainly in the antral mucosa and were generally restricted to the neck portion of the pyloric glands, although a few were present in fundic glands of the gastric body. The beta-HCG-immunoreactive cells were found in gastric carcinomas in 53% of the 92 cases examined. These cells were observed more often in advanced carcinomas that were histologically poorly differentiated than in early carcinomas or in well-differentiated tumors, but this prevalence had no statistical significance. The presence of the beta-HCG-positive cells in the gastric carcinomas suggested no appreciable prognostic significance, even quantitatively. In the syncytiotrophoblast-like tumor cells seen in four gastric tumor samples with histologic features of a choriocarcinoma, immunoreactivity to the beta-HCG was striking. There was, however, no recognizable dominance in the number of beta-HCG-reactive cells in the noncancerous mucosa around the tumor.\r"

We studied 102 children with newly diagnosed acute leukemia (50 retrospective: Group A; and 52 prospective: Group B) with prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), thrombin time (TT), fibrinogen (FIB), and fibrin degradation products (FDP). All patients in Group B also had assessment of thrombin activation by measurement of the crosslinked fibrin fragment, D-dimer, and of primary fibrinolysis with the B beta 1-42 peptide. Additionally, ten patients from Group B had Factors II, V, VII, and X measured, and eight of these patients had measurement of tissue factor from sonicated bone marrow cells. Thirty-two percent of Group A and 40% of Group B had totally normal coagulation studies, whereas 20% of Group A and 10% of Group B had a severe coagulopathy on disease presentation. A high percentage of both groups had elevated PT (Group A, 52%; Group B, 27%) and increased FDP (Group A, 39%; Group B, 25%). In Group B, 38% of the patients had a positive D-dimer, whereas only 4% of this prospective group had an elevated B beta 1-42 peptide (P less than 0.00001). Nine of ten patients with a positive D-dimer had low levels of one or more of the extrinsic pathway factors. Three of four patients with the highest tissue factor levels were of monocytoid leukemia cell type. These data indicate that the coagulopathy associated with acute leukemia of childhood is usually mediated by thrombin activation.\r"

More traditional clinical and serologic markers were also evaluated. Univariate analysis showed that all of the biochemical markers mentioned above, the Karnofsky index (KI) and the patient's sex were related to both the stage of disease (limited/extensive disease: LD/ED) and to survival. The strongest marker for the clinical stage was S-TK, whereas TPA showed the strongest relationship with survival. Multivariate analyses produced a model consisting of S-TK, CEA, NSE, and the patient's sex for determining the clinical stage. To compare the prognostic capacity of easily determined biochemical and simple clinical variables to the more resource-demanding variable of the clinical stage, three multivariate analyses in relation to survival were performed: (1) biochemical markers and simple clinical variables; (2) LD/ED and simple clinical variables; and (3) all available variables. The model obtained from the first analysis included TPA, KI, age, and the patient's sex; the model from the second analyses included LD/ED, patient's age, and KI; and the model from the third analysis, TPA, KI, age, sex, and LD/ED. Indices based on these three multivariate models were calculated for each patient and the prognostic capacity of these indices was compared. Pretreatment serum marker levels also had the capacity to predict both the grade and the duration of the response to therapy.\r"

The HPV DNA was isolated from 52% of patients (low-risk types = 4%, high-risk types = 48%). Seventy-five percent had a cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)-condyloma. Low-risk types were infrequent (7%) and high-risk types (41%) predominant in condyloma/CIN I lesions when converse rates were expected. As CIN I lesions harboring high-risk types are at some risk of progressing to a higher grade dysplasia, colposcopic examination and treatment of this subgroup would seem justified. As expected, high-risk types were statistically associated with increasing grades of dysplasia. This hybridization method identified typeable HPV DNA in 60% of patients with a CIN-condyloma, and highlighted a unique HPV profile for this patient cohort.\r"

This was done to define the relationship of aneuploidy to prostatic adenocarcinoma grade, volume, and pathologic stage and to examine its utility in candidates for surgical treatment. Aneuploidy was found in 26 (46%) cases. With one exception, all of the aneuploid cases were found in tumors larger than 4 cc. The percentage of aneuploid cases increased with advancing pathologic stage, and it was highest in those cases with lymph node metastases. This percentage was also higher among more poorly differentiated tumors. However, diploid tumors were also found among these groups, and the relationship between aneuploidy versus pathologic stage and grade did not achieve statistical significance. Except for a 91% specificity for tumor volume greater than 4 cc, the sensitivity and specificity of DNA content analysis to predict these groups was low (50% to 72%). It is concluded that aneuploidy is a later event linked to tumor progression, but it is not a requirement for progression to occur. The overlap in aneuploid and diploid tumor behavior precludes the use of DNA content analysis as an independent predictor to direct preoperative treatment of prostatic carcinoma.\r"

All lesions showed exclusively DNA diploidy, and the S- phase fractions were usually low, ranging from 2% to 13% (mean, 6.9%). The follow-up periods were from 2 to 60 months. Five patients died, with one of the deaths attributed to pulmonary failure resulting from diffuse alveolar damage and Kaposi's sarcoma; the other deaths were attributed to infections. These results indicate that Kaposi's sarcoma is not a high-grade neoplasm and, combined with previously reported evidence, may suggest that Kaposi's sarcoma associated with AIDS is a proliferative process rather than a malignant neoplasm.\r"

  ".W": "Colloid cysts are relatively rare benign tumors comprising less than 2% of all intracranial mass lesions. However, since the advent of computed tomography of the head, these tumors are being recognized more frequently, occasionally before their symptomatic presentation. Much controversy remains as to the true cells of origin and pathogenesis of these cysts. Although a neuroepithelial origin has become increasingly accepted, Rathke cleft cysts, ectopic respiratory tissue, and other endodermal sources have been postulated. The first familial occurrence in middle-aged identical twin brothers was cited recently in the literature. Described here are the first reports of symptomatic colloid cysts in two nontwin brothers, lending further support to the potential for genetic expression of neuroepithelial cysts. Also included are preoperative computed axial tomographic images, histopathologic photomicrographs with case descriptions and comparisons, and suggestions to elucidate further the development and presentation of colloid cysts.\r"

This included limb-salvage procedures in three patients. Additional postoperative chemotherapy was administered. Four patients remain alive and continuously free of disease 3.5+ to 4.5+ years after retreatment with IA-CDP.\r"

Exposure information was obtained through mailed questionnaires to 96 cases, 450 randomly selected population referents, and 200 cancer referents. Odds ratios (OR), were calculated for various occupational groups, and particularly, for occupations with potential exposure to chlorinated phenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols. In the analyses based on population referents, increased risks for soft tissue sarcoma were seen for especially gardeners (OR = 4.1), but also railroad workers (OR = 3.1); construction workers with exposure to impregnating agents (OR = 2.3), asbestos (OR = 1.8), or pressure impregnating agents (OR = 1.7); and unspecified chemical workers with potential exposure to phenoxy herbicides and/or chlorophenols (OR = 1.6). A similar pattern appeared when cancer referents were used although the numerical values of the odds ratios became different. A grouping of jobs resulted in Mantel-Haensel OR from 1.5 to 1.9 for farmers and forestry workers, dependent on referents used and even more increased OR for railroad workers and unspecified chemical workers with potential exposure to phenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols. The results of the study confirm rather than refute that phenoxy herbicides and chlorophenols could be of etiologic importance for STS; the high risk for gardeners, although based on a small number of individuals, was unexpected and remains unclear. Also, since other cancers were used as referents, no definite problems of recall bias should obtain in this material. None of the exposed groups had a higher proportion of smokers than the unexposed group.\r"

Changes made in 1988 with respect to age criteria, intervals for mammography, and which risk factors to include are discussed. The result of these changes is that 83% of women 40 years of age and older are now eligible for regular mammography compared with 57% under the former system. The total use of mammography in any given year remains unchanged. The results of this analysis have implications for other organizations attempting to promote the use of mammography.\r"

The material consisted of 10,181 patients 25 to 69 years of age at diagnosis, whose cancer was diagnosed between 1971 and 1980. The classification of social class was based on occupation. The effects of social class, age, period of diagnosis, and stage of disease on survival were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model; mortality from causes of death other than breast cancer was taken into account using the exact causes of death. Those in the lowest social class had about 1.3 times higher relative excess risk of dying than those in the highest social class. The older the patients, the greater was the difference in survival by social class. Differences in stage distribution explained only a minor proportion of the variation in survival by social class. The Finnish legislation guarantees everyone fairly equal accessibility to health care. The results suggest that more determined efforts should be undertaken to reduce inequity in survival.\r"

In this report the authors describe young woman with acute stem cell leukemia which was terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase positive, and involved the bone marrow and peripheral blood. After induction of remission and a 2-year disease-free interval, she relapsed with involvement localized to the uterus and cervix. At relapse the leukemic cells expressed CD1, CD2, CD5, CD7, and CD4 or CD8, antigens of the common thymocyte compartment. The authors postulate that the T-cell antigens, known extracellular matrix receptors, may have determined the tissue infiltration: an unusual pattern of relapse.\r"

Results of combination remission-induction chemotherapy were compared with 126 patients contemporarily treated for primary AML. The duration of hypoplasia, induced by remission induction chemotherapy, tended to be longer in the sAML and MDS patients when compared to de novo AML, but reached significance only for the duration of thrombocytopenia: 26 days versus 18 days (P less than 0.01). The number of hypoplastic deaths during remission-induction chemotherapy of patients with sAML and MDS was low. Four of the 36 patients treated for sAML or MDS died during hypoplastic phases induced by remission-induction chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR) rates were similar in primary AML (67%), sAML (62%), and MDS (64%). The CR rates of patients younger than 45 years were 75% for de novo AML, 75% for sAML, and 71% for MDS. Remission rates in patients older than 45 years were identical in the three subgroups but significantly (P less than 0.005) inferior to those obtained in younger patients: 56%, 50%, and 57%, in de novo AML, sAML, and MDS, respectively. The remission duration without bone marrow transplant (BMT) was significantly shorter (P less than 0.01) in MDS and sAML when compared with primary AML. Long-lasting CR in MDS and sAML was only obtained in three of the six patients treated with allogeneic BMT. Intensive antileukemic therapy could be considered in young patients with MDS and life-threatening cytopenias or patients with sAML.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, the activity and side effects of high-dose cytosine arabinoside (HD-Ara-C) in combination with mitoxantrone (mitox) (HAM) was evaluated in 32 heavily pretreated patients with refractory Hodgkin's disease. Therapy consisted of HD-Ara-C 3 g/m2 every 12 hours days 1 and 2 and mitox 10 mg/m2/d days 3 to 5. In subsequent steps, HD-Ara-C was escalated to six and eight doses for 3 and 4 days, respectively, and mitox to four doses on days 2 to 5. Thirty-two patients 17 to 55 years of age entered the study. Twenty-five cases presented with extranodal disease and disseminated organ involvement and 21 revealed systemic (B) symptoms. Eighteen patients (56%) responded with five complete and 13 partial remissions, ten patients (31%) had refractory disease, and four patients died from infections during treatment-induced cytopenia. The predominant toxicity was severe myelosuppression in all patients with major infections occurring during 55% of treatment courses. Ten of the responding 18 patients underwent subsequent autologous (n = 9) or allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). Seven of these cases are currently alive at 5+ to 22+ months, six of them without evidence of disease. Among the remaining eight patients not receiving BMT, three are alive at 6+ to 19+ months from the initiation of HAM, two of them in ongoing remissions of 2+ and 5+ months' duration. Two patients died from transplant-related complications and six patients succumbed to progressive disease following relapse. The median survival for all treated patients is 6.2 months. These data indicate that HAM has a significant activity in refractory Hodgkin's disease. However, the substantial side effects and the lack of an obvious superiority to alternative, less intensive regimens limits the further application of the two-drug combination in its present form. Modifications in timing and dosage and the addition of hematopoietic growth factors will be evaluated in subsequent trials.\r"

Silicone gel implants were used in 13 patients and free-injected silicone in one patient. The total radiation dose ranged from 4400 to 6200 cGy using tangential photon fields or an en face electron field by megavoltage equipment. In several cases, electron boost radiation was added to the tumor bed. The majority of the patients tolerated therapy well with minimal transient skin reactions; only three patients required a treatment break secondary to moist desquamation. Three patients developed documented implant encapsulation, although the majority retained good to excellent cosmesis. In summary, when breast carcinoma arises in the augmented or reconstructed breast, conservative management (i.e., limited surgery and definitive irradiation) is feasible without compromising the therapy or the cosmetic result. Thus, conservative management should be offered as an option to patients who are interested in breast prosthesis conservation.\r"

All the patients were treated with 2450 MHz microwaves by means of a generator with 4 magnetrons (250 to 300 W) and arterial applicators delivering 5 to 10 W/cm2. Each applicator is coupled with an infrared thermometer allowing an atraumatic temperature control processed by a PC-compatible computer using a Turbo Pascal program. A temperature of 41.5 degrees C to 42.5 degrees C was maintained for 45 minutes from the skin surface to a 2.5-cm depth within tissues. Hyperthermia alone was done in four patients; hyperthermia was combined with chemotherapy in four patients, and with electrontherapy (2 X 450 cGy or 3 X 350 cGy/week) in 34 patients: tumor dose under 3000 cGy in seven patients and over 3000 cGy in 27 patients. We observed a complete response in 22 patients (52.3%), a partial response (greater than 50%) in 11 patients (26.1%), and no response in nine patients (21.4%). No complete response was observed in patients treated with hyperthermia alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy. The local control was demonstrated to be improved only in patients treated with hyperthermia and radiotherapy. The results were correlated with tumor stage: ten complete responses out of 12 Stage 1, and one complete response out of four Stage 4. We noted nine side effects completely reversible within a month with no late skin reaction. Our results show that hyperthermia can give improved local control without any morbidity in treating chest wall recurrences of breast cancer.\r"

Nine of 17 patients with AML and four of 11 patients with ALL had P-gp-positive results at the initial presentation, and most P-gp-positive patients did not respond to chemotherapy. Four of seven patients at the relapsed stage and all three patients with preceding myelodysplastic syndrome had P-gp-positive results. The expression of P-gp and clinical refractoriness to chemotherapy were highly correlated. These data indicate that the expression of P-gp is closely related to clinical drug resistance in acute leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "The risk of any second malignancy was determined for all patients treated for a primary cancer of the breast without evidence of distant metastasis at Duke University Medical Center between 1970 and 1981. The incidence, 10-year actuarial risk (AR), and relative risk (RR) of a second malignancy developing were calculated for the 407 patients who were treated with surgery alone, 226 who were treated with surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (CT), 140 who were treated with surgery plus adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), and 308 who received all three modalities (CRT). The AR of a subsequent cancer (8.4% for CRT, 8.7% for CT, 8.7% for RT, and 11.7% for surgery only patients) did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The overall second cancer RR was 1.0% after CRT (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4 to 2.0), 1.3% after RT (95% CI, 0.6 to 2.5), 1.6% after CT (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.6), and 1.7% after surgery alone (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.4). Contralateral breast cancers (RR of 4.2%; 95% CI, 2.7 to 6.3) account for the statistically significant excess of second malignancies among the surgery alone patients. The AR for contralateral breast cancer in the surgery group was higher than in either group receiving CT (P less than 0.01), but was not significantly different from the RT group. The RR for solid tumors other than breast cancer was not significantly different from unity in any of the treatment groups. The RR for acute leukemia was 16.7% in the CRT group (95% CI, 0.2 to 92.7), 11.1% in the CT group (95% CI, 0.1 to 61.8), 10.0% in the surgery alone group (95% CI, 1.1 to 36.1), and 0.0% in the RT group (95% CI, 0.0 to 61.1). This study indicated that inclusion of RT and/or CT in the initial treatment of breast cancer did not impact negatively on patients' overall risk for a subsequent malignancy during the first decade after therapy, and that adjuvant CT with or without RT may decrease their risk of a contralateral breast cancer.\r"

The radiologic appearance of the tumors could be divided into intraluminal, wall-thickening, and exophytic forms. Wall-thickening and exophytic forms in this study accounted for 62% of the tumors. This indicates that malignant tumors of the trachea tend to extraluminal invasion. Tomography and computed tomography are the most helpful methods of radiologic examination for tracheal tumors. Bronchoscopy and radiologic examination are complementary procedures. The chief advantage of imaging is the demonstration of tracheal wall thickening and extraluminal changes. Hemoptysis, dyspnea, and cough were the most common symptoms. Four cases (7%) in our series presented as thyroid tumors due to direct extension into the thyroid gland. Fifteen of the 54 cases (28%) were associated with other carcinomas of the head and neck and the lung.\r"

The platelet count at time of catheter placement was significantly lower in the nontransplant group, and the thrombus-free survival was longer in patients whose catheter was placed when their platelet count was less than 150,000, suggesting that thrombocytopenia delays thrombotic complications. Placement of two Hickman catheters resulted in a 12.9% thrombosis rate (21 of 162 patients) and was significantly more likely to be associated with thrombosis than placement of one catheter. Long-term follow-up evaluation of patients treated without successful fibrinolytic therapy showed no residual symptoms of venous obstruction. In those patients presenting with concomitant catheter obstruction resulting from thrombosis, low-dose fibrinolytic therapy was successful in restoring catheter function 70% of the time. Placement of two Hickman catheters is associated with an inordinate incidence of thrombosis. Thrombocytopenia at the time of catheter placement may delay this complication. Thrombotic catheter obstruction can be treated successfully with low-dose fibrinolytic therapy. Even without fibrinolytic therapy, catheter-induced subclavian vein thrombosis rarely causes long-term disability.\r"

Adenomatous polyp counts exceeded those found in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) but were fewer than in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Colon cancer occurred at a later age than in HNPCC or FAP and showed right-sided predominance. The older age of patients with colonic cancer, the right-sided predominance of colon cancer, and the paucity of rectal adenomas make FAP unlikely. Vertical transmission of polyps and colon cancer fit the pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance. A characteristic feature of this phenotype is the predominance of flat adenomas. Molecular genetic studies, with careful description of phenotype, should help clarify classification.\r"

Vessels and vessel convolutes with wide lumina and thin walls are characteristic of the embryonal type. Essential properties of both types of vessel formation are presented, as well as the gradual transformation of giant multinuclear cells.

Indeed, CsA exerts a growth inhibition in vitro of several human and animal, normal and neoplastic cell types. To assess a possible in vivo direct cytostatic activity of CsA, the authors evaluated the proportion of S-phase (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporating) cells of epithelial origin (skin, tongue, esophagus) of congenitally athymic (nude) mice bearing xenografts of human skin and receiving a daily subcutaneous injection of 50 mg/kg of CsA for 3 weeks. As compared with control animals, CsA-treated mice showed a decreased labeling index (LI) of all the epithelial tissues studied, which was statistically significant in the case of epidermis (both human and murine) and the tongue. Because nude mice lack T-cell-mediated immunity, these results suggest that CsA also exerts an immunologically independent antiproliferative activity on epithelial cells in vivo and they also highlight the interest in pursuing studies on cyclosporins as cytostatic agents.\r"

The largest group had malignant fibrous histiocytoma (44%), followed by liposarcoma (24%) and fibrosarcoma (16%). Also represented were clear cell sarcoma, neurogenic sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and alveolar soft part sarcoma (4% each). Of 19 patients treated by wide local excision or simple mastectomy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy, 11 had local recurrence develop, of which one patient died and nine of the remaining ten had metastases develop. Of the remaining eight patients in this group with no local recurrence, only two had metastases develop. Of the six patients treated by radical or Patey mastectomy, none had local recurrence develop, but two died of metastases. No patient had metastases develop more than 5 years after diagnosis. Regional lymph node involvement with tumor was observed in only one patient (with malignant fibrous histiocytoma) despite regional lymphadenopathy in seven. The overall mortality at 5 years is 64% but does not increase thereafter. The authors' findings suggest that failure to establish local control is associated with a poor prognosis and that wide local excision or simple mastectomy does not provide sufficient clearance to be used as first-line treatment. Excision of the axillary lymphatics and adjuvant radiotherapy are unlikely to be beneficial.\r"

This carcinoma was histologically characterized by the sparse population of small nests consisting of poorly differentiated carcinoma cells, widely separated by intervening nondesmoplastic stroma infiltrated uniformly with abundant lymphocytes frequently accompanied by lymph follicles. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that T-cells were evenly distributed throughout the tumor with intimate contact with individual carcinoma cells, except the lymph follicles consisted mainly of B-cells. Because of the similarities of morphologic features and subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes of this carcinoma to the normal lymphoid tissue, an organized immune response combined with cell-mediated and humoral immunities against the invading carcinoma cells seemed to occur in this type of gastric carcinoma, resulting in a excellent prognosis compared with that in ordinary gastric carcinoma.\r"

The DNA ploidy and proliferative pattern of each sample were determined using flow cytometry. In 11 patients, histology of mucosal sections from the same sites also was analyzed. We found a higher frequency of aneuploidy than previously reported in mucosa up to 10 cm from a colorectal cancer; 62% (23/37) of the primary cancers were aneuploid, and of these, 48% (11/23) were associated with adjacent aneuploid mucosa. The mucosa adjacent to the 14 diploid cancers had only diploid characteristics. The proliferative activity (as reflected by synthetic (S) phase fraction) of aneuploid cancers (21.1 +/- 2.0% SEM) and aneuploid mucosa as far as 10 cm away (21.2 +/- 2.1% SEM) was higher than in normal controls (10.2 +/- 0.7% SEM) (P less than 0.0005). Parallel cytology excluded shed cancer cells as an explanation for these findings. Histology showed diffuse, generally mild and reactive, mucosal abnormalities in eight of 11 patients. Ploidy did not correlate with histologic abnormalities. The findings of aneuploidy and high S-phase fraction in uninvolved superficial mucosa provide evidence for a field defect in mucosa adjacent to colorectal cancer and support the concept that the large bowel mucosa behaves as a unit in carcinogenesis.\r"

We conclude that the factors that best predict prognosis are hemoglobin levels and age at presentation. Different approaches including more appropriate chemotherapeutic regimes and comprehensive geriatric assessment with improved supportive treatment need to be developed for the geriatric patient with multiple myeloma.\r"

Among all cases, 26% had initial symptoms characterized by lesions of the nasopharynx and the majority by cervical mass. Among the children, symptoms involving the cranial nerve were rarely observed. There were significant differences between adults and children on histopathology other than the ratio of carcinoma to sarcoma (4:1 for children; 443:1 for adults). Among the poorly differentiated carcinoma cases, vesicular nucleus carcinoma was observed more frequently in children than adults. The prognosis for children with NPC is poor with a 5-year survival rate of 21% in this series. If NPC is diagnosed early and radiotherapy begun promptly (with doses greater than 5000 cGy), the prognosis may be improved.\r"

Interobserver reproducibility of the diagnosis of lymphatic vessel invasion (LVI) was 82% (kappa 0.60). The observers agreed on the presence of LVI in 23 patients (24%), of whom 21 (91%) had positive lymph nodes. Only among patients in whom more than ten emboli were identified was the frequency of positive lymph nodes markedly higher than in the total material. The location of tumor emboli relative to the invasive tumor was of little significance. LVI was a more powerful predictor of lymph node status than tumor size, margin contour, histologic grade and histologic type, and was highly significant also when controlled for these features.\r"

The remaining 12 patients were referred for therapy after receiving primary therapy elsewhere. All episodes of recurrence were observed within 36 months of remission with 50% and 85% before 3 and 18 months, respectively. Fourteen (56%) of 25 patients who achieved secondary remission developed a second recurrence and five (45%) of 11 surviving a second recurrence developed one or more further episodes of recurrent GTD. Nineteen patients (68%) have sustained remission 18 months following therapy for recurrent GTD. Factors relating to development and survival of recurrent disease include: poor prognosis metastatic disease, inadequate initial staging and therapy, lack of adequate maintenance chemotherapy beyond the first negative hCG level, and prolonged intervals between cycles of chemotherapy. Recent regimens introduced have contributed to an increasing salvage rate: 15 of 18 patients treated since 1978 are without evidence of disease whereas only four of ten treated prior to 1978 are currently in remission (P = 0.03).\r"

Twelve postmenopausal and three perimenopausal women with vaginal bleeding due to endometrial hyperplasia received 400 mg/d of danazol orally for 3 months. After 15 to 30 days of continuous danazol therapy, the endometrial glands ceased to grow and became smaller and rounder. The lumina of glands were narrow and contained no secretion. The nucleic mitosis of the glands disappeared. All women showed regression of hyperplastic endometrium within 2 to 3 months of initial treatment. In the 15 cases treated, endometrial hyperplasia could be controlled successfully with danazol without further recurrence and/or progression of the disease. In summary, danazol should be an effective and safe alternative therapy to progesterone for the treatment of endometrial hyperplasia.\r"

The renal response to protein loading of single kidney adults is unclear and it has not been evaluated yet in children. Therefore, we studied 8 children 10.2 +/- 1.1 years old, 6.7 +/- 1.41 years after nephrectomy (SK) and 4 healthy children (C). RPF was estimated by para-amino-hippurate clearance (Cpah) and GFR by inulin clearance (Cin) before and after an oral protein load of 1.5 g protein/kg body wt and expressed in ml/min/1.73 m2 BSA. Mean baseline Cin were similar in SK and in C (90 +/- 8 vs 103 +/- 12) while baseline Cpah was lower in SK (339 +/- 19 vs 481 +/- 36, p less than 0.005). After the meal GFR and RPF increased significantly in C (155 +/- 18 and 783 +/- 68, p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.05 vs baseline values, respectively) whereas no significant GFR and RPF changes were seen in SK (81 +/- 9 and 350 +/- 42, respectively). However, the 3 SK children with lower protein intake showed a mild vasodilating response. We conclude that in single kidney children hyperfiltration occurs at baseline conditions and the renal response to acute protein loading is partially or completely blunted, being modulated by protein intake.\r"

  ".W": "Thyrotropin (TSH) secretion was evaluated in a group of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) undergoing regular maintenance hemofiltration and in normal controls. The study group included 68 patients (39 males and 29 females, age range 39-73 years, mean: 53 years). In all patients blood was drawn at 08:30-09:00 h; in 20 patients the nocturnal (24:00-02:00 h) serum TSH peak was also evaluated; 12 patients underwent stimulation test with synthetic TSH-releasing hormone (TRH). TSH was measured by an ultrasensitive immunoradiometric assay. CRF patients showed a significant decrease in serum total and free thyroxine and triiodothyronine concentrations, which in a substantial proportion of subjects were below the lower normal limit. Serum reverse triiodothyronine and thyroxine-binding globulin values did not differ in the two groups. Despite this trend of thyroid hormones to decrease, no patient had supranormal TSH values as in primary hypothyroidism. While the mean morning TSH concentrations of CRF patients did not differ from those of controls, the mean nocturnal values were significantly reduced in CRF (1.0 +/- 0.2 vs 3.2 +/- 0.4 mU/l, p less than 0.0005) and the nocturnal serum TSH surge was not observed in 18 of the 20 patients (90%) in whom it was evaluated. The mean serum TSH peak value after TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) administration was also reduced in CRF patients, and the TSH response to TRH was blunted in 3 out of 12 patients (25%). The results of this study demonstrate a major impairment of TSH secretion in CRF, which baseline TSH measurements in the morning and the evaluation of the TSH response to TRH may not reveal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eight hemodialysis patients and six healthy control subjects received an intravenous dose of 45calcium and 32phosphate and an oral tracer dose of 45Ca and 32P was administered two weeks later. Timed plasma samples were obtained on each occasion to determine fractional absorption rates and cumulative absorption of either tracer from both tracer sets with deconvolution analysis. Stool collections were analyzed. Calcium absorption in normal subjects peaked at 12% over fifteen minutes at one hour and declined rapidly thereafter. Absorption was essentially complete at four hours and cumulative absorption at this time was 72 +/- 6%. The pattern of phosphate absorption was similar and cumulative absorption at 4 hours was 80 +/- 3%. Calcium absorption in dialysis patients was significantly impaired with a flattened profile, a maximal 15-min absorption rate of 2% and cumulative 4-h absorption of 20 +/- 2%. Phosphate absorption in dialysis patients was also impaired to a comparable degree with a maximal rate of 3.6% and a more delayed cumulative total of 35 +/- 5%. Stool data showed good agreement with deconvolution analysis in volunteers but always overestimated absorption in patients. Sequential double isotope analysis provided a simple and convenient method for the concurrent estimation of calcium and phosphate absorption in humans.\r"

Polyethyleneimine (PEI) was used as a cationic probe. The basement membrane was divided into the peripheral portion (loop basement membrane 7 microns or more from the anchor portion), proximal portion (within 3 microns of the anchor portion), and the paramesangial portion in the paramesangial basement membrane. In each portion, PEI granules per 1 micron of the LRE and LRI were counted. Anionic sites were decreased in the patients with FGS and MPGN, but the damage pattern differed between the two diseases. In the patients with FGS, the decrease in anionic sites was most marked in the peripheral portion with an even greater decrease in the LRI. In the patients with MPGN, the decrease was uniform among the portions. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in any portion between the patients with IgA nephropathy or HSPN and the controls. The portions with decreased negative charge varied among various glomerular diseases, suggesting different developmental mechanisms.\r"

The scale was shown to be a valid measure of barriers to adherence as assessed by its relationship to the barriers to adherence questionnaire and the barriers to adherence portion of the diabetes-care profile. The medication, testing, exercise, and diet subscales of the EBAS were correlated with four corresponding and three noncorresponding measures of self-care behavior from the diabetes self-care behaviors scale. Each subscale correlated well with its corresponding self-care behavior. The internal consistency of the scale and the test-retest reliability were found to be good. The results suggest that the EBAS scale is a valid, reliable measure of barriers to diabetes-regimen adherence.\r"

A test-retest design was used for subjects enrolled in a diabetes in pregnancy program at a university hospital. There were 58 women with overt diabetes (OD; insulin dependent and non-insulin dependent) and 67 women with gestational diabetes (GD). Three forms of the DPKS scale were developed for use with women with OD and women with GD treated or not treated with insulin. Adequate readability, internal consistency (r = 0.71), and test-retest reliability (r = 0.76) were demonstrated with the DPKS. Initial support for the validity of the measure is suggested by its ability to differentiate women with GD versus OD, women on insulin versus those who are diet controlled, and women with shorter versus longer duration of illness. The DPKS may prove a useful clinical tool for diabetes educators working with pregnant women.\r"

The Cough Test (CT), a standardized test that uses a series of coughs with electrocardiographic monitoring, was used to assess the functional integrity of cardiovascular autonomic nerves. In 224 control subjects and 235 diabetic patients, heart-rate (HR) responses were compared with four established tests: lying to standing (LS), standing to lying (SL), deep breathing (DB), and Valsalva maneuver (VM). In control subjects, HR responses declined significantly with age in a curvilinear pattern. Log-transformed indices were used to estimate percentiles. The CT-HR responses were reproducible and significantly associated with other HR-response tests. Sixty-nine (29%) diabetic patients had an abnormal value less than or equal to 1st percentile, whereas only 2 control subjects had such an abnormality. Among diabetic patients, age and duration of diabetes exerted a significant negative influence. With the use of the criteria of two abnormal or one abnormal and two borderline tests (among CT, LS, SL, DB, or VM) as a minimal criteria for cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, CT and LS had the least overlap between the control and diabetic populations and were significantly better than SL or VM (P less than 0.005 for CT, P less than 0.01 for LS). They were not different from DB. We found the CT to be simple to perform, reproducible, and useful for the assessment of cardiovascular autonomic reflexes.\r"

  ".W": "To identify characteristics associated with long-term avoidance of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) complications, subjects taking part in an epidemiologic natural history study of childhood-onset IDDM, with a duration of disease greater than or equal to 25 yr, were studied. Nineteen percent of 175 subjects had avoided overt nephropathy, definite cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease, clinical neuropathy, and proliferative retinopathy. Approximately half of the nonrenal complications occurred in the absence of renal disease. Subjects free of these advanced complications were characterized by a longer duration of disease (P less than 0.05), better lipid profile and blood pressure (P less than 0.01), and considerably lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels (P less than 0.001). Health-related behaviors, including recent medical contact, regular glucose monitoring, physical activity in youth, and avoidance of cigarette smoking, did not relate to complication status, although regular (at least weekly) alcohol consumption was more prevalent (P less than 0.05) in those without complications. We conclude that a lower mean glycosylated hemoglobin level is strongly related to the avoidance of all IDDM complications.\r"

We conducted a study on a subsample of families of subjects in the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study to examine these issues. A sample of 5 White and 5 Hispanic subjects (probands) with diabetic glucose tolerance tests and the same number with normal glucose tolerance were selected. The 20 probands all provided contact information on their 227 primary family members. Ninety-two percent of the family members had interviews completed by themselves or, if deceased, by surrogates other than the proband. Family members were asked by telephone if they had ever been tested for diabetes, when they had been most recently tested, why they had been tested, and if they had ever been told they had diabetes. The results showed that study subjects accurately reported family history of diabetes, because there were no discrepancies between proband and family reports. A positive family history of diabetes was associated with increased reported screening in Hispanics, but a similar effect in White families was not seen. Women were also more likely to report being screened than men regardless of whether there was a positive family history of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The study group consisted of 11 patients with NIDDM and 11 nondiabetic subjects of comparable age and body mass index. All subjects were sedentary and basally normotensive. Bicycle ergometry was used to assess the effect of exercise on blood pressure at a steady state of 70-75 W, with a target duration of 20 min. Blood pressure was measured basally and every 5 min. Greater exercise-induced systolic blood pressure (mean max 208.0 +/- 6.0 vs. 177.0 +/- 3.0 mmHg) occurred in the NIDDM group (P less than 0.001). Neither pulse rate nor diastolic blood pressure differed between the groups before or during exercise. Return to basal pulse and blood pressure was similar. Mild to moderate exercise induces greater systolic blood pressure in sedentary patients with NIDDM. Because exercise is recommended as one therapeutic modality, intraexercise blood pressure should be considered in assessing the safety of this form of treatment.\r"

Goiter was noted in 20% of subjects. Thyroid-specific autoantibody was positive in 19% of subjects. Twenty-seven subjects (7%) had thyroid dysfunction. Autoantibody testing identified subjects with thyroid dysfunction with a sensitivity of 50%, a specificity of 84%, a degree of misclassification of 17%, a positive predictive value of 13%, and a negative predictive value of 97%. We recommend that all children and adolescents be screened shortly after diagnosis of IDDM by determination of thyroid-stimulating hormone (measured by high-sensitivity assay) to identify thyroid dysfunction and by testing for antibody to thyroid microsomal antigen to characterize both risk of future thyroid dysfunction and the need for future testing.\r"

  ".W": "Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to human GH (hGH) were used to correlate the antigenic topography of the hormone with its structure. Competition experiments performed in a solid phase RIA system allowed us to measure the reactivity toward the MAb of the following hGH derivatives: hGH 20K (a natural variant lacking residues 32-46), hGH selectively modified in His or Met residues, hGH with the C and/or N-terminal disulfide bond reduced and carbamidomethylated, and hGH cleaved between residues 142-143. Results indicated that fragment 32-46 participates in the structure of epitopes EB1/EB3 and that the C-terminal bridge is located in epitope 10D6, whereas opening of both disulfide bridges alters the entire hGH antigenic surface. His-151 and Met-170 were placed in epitopes NA71 and AC8, respectively, whereas His-18 and Met-14 would be involved in the hGH antigenic domain formed by overlapping epitopes 3C11, 10C1, and HG3. MAb AE5, AE12, and AC3 define a flexible hGH region related to sequence 134-150; the respective epitopes show high conformational mobility induced by modifications in other regions of the molecule. Binding of the different hGH derivatives to lactogenic receptors from female rat liver gave some insights on the localization of the hormone-binding site. Epitopes EB1/EB3 and 10D6 were discarded because there was not a direct correlation between their drastic immunological alterations and the binding properties of the respective hGH derivatives. In the same way, epitopes AE5, AE12, and AC3 were excluded from the hGH-binding domain because a disruption in those sites did not affect the hGH interaction with receptors. We conclude that the hGH structure defined by epitopes 3C11, 10C1, and HG3 is probably related to the binding properties of the hormone.\r"

  ".W": "A set of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to human GH (hGH) was used to study the hormone binding orientation to its receptors (R) from female rat liver. The hGH antigenic region left exposed after its binding to liver microsomes was detected by measuring the ability of various [125I]MAb to bind to the preformed hGH-R complexes. Results indicated that a cluster of epitopes defined by the MAb, termed AE5, AC8, and AE12, remains accessible in the hGH-R complex whereas overlapping epitopes 3C11 and HG3 would define a hGH region involved in the binding site. Supporting these findings, solubilization and HPLC gel filtration of [125I]MAb-hGH-R complexes showed a radioactive peak of about 450,000 mol wt for MAb AE5 or AC8, but not for MAb 3C11 or HG3. [125I]MAb AE12 behaved differently, suggesting that epitope AE12 may be masked or altered in hGH-R-solubilized complexes. MAb directed to the putative hGH-binding site (MAb 3C11, HG3, and the closely related MAb 10C1 and NA71) failed to inhibit binding of the preformed [125I]MAb AE5-hGH complex to the receptors, suggesting a hormone modification after MAb AE5 binding. Accordingly competition experiments indicated an increase in the affinity of hGH for its receptors induced by this MAb. A higher hGH concentration was required to obtain 50% [125I]hGH binding to liver microsomes in the presence of MAb AE5 than in its absence. As the MAb used define epitopes that were previously correlated with the hGH structure, we concluded that a high flexible region (sequences 134-150) is exposed in the hGH-R complex. Furthermore, some MAb directed to this region enhance the hormone affinity for its rat liver receptors, probably through an induced conformational change.\r"

We demonstrate that within 90 min of administration of recombinant human TNF alpha to rats there is a rapid increase in plasma levels of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) of normal ultracentrifugal flotation rate, apoprotein and lipid composition, and particle size, as assessed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Clearance of radioiodinated VLDL 90 min after TNF administration did not differ from that in control animals, consistent with other observations that increases in plasma triglyceride concentrations after TNF precede detectable reductions in tissue lipoprotein lipase activity. Between 90 min and 16 h after TNF, VLDL levels decline, and there are increases in intermediate (IDL) and low (LDL) density lipoproteins consistent with lipolytic processing of VLDL, although the findings are also compatible with direct secretion of IDL and LDL subspecies. By 16 h, there is a 50% increase in protein mass of LDL of normal composition and subspecies distribution, as assessed by nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. These data suggest that the initial locus of TNF's metabolic effects is the liver, and the resulting increases in secretion and metabolic processing of VLDL may represent an early manifestation of the acute phase response.\r"

The effects of AVP on V2 receptors in the kidney are well characterized. In order to determine whether V1 receptors, coupled to phospholipase C for hydrolysis of PI, are also present in the kidney, we investigated the effects of AVP on PI hydrolysis in tissue slices from the cortex, outer medulla, and inner medulla of the rabbit kidney. We found that 10(-6) M AVP produced a significant increase in PI hydrolysis in the inner and outer medulla but not in the cortex. In the inner medulla, AVP (10(-10) M) produced a greater than 50% increase in PI hydrolysis; the effect was much greater at higher concentrations. AVP-stimulated PI hydrolysis was blocked by a V1 antagonist but not by a V2 antagonist. Increasing the osmolality of the incubation to 600 mosmol/kg water also abolished the effect of AVP on PI hydrolysis in the inner medulla. Furthermore, AVP did not stimulate PI hydrolysis (even in isoosmotic media) in isolated inner medullary collecting duct cells which make a major portion of the inner medulla. Our results indicate: 1) V1 receptors linked to PI system are not present in the inner medullary collecting duct cells but are probably present in blood vessels and/or interstitial cells of the renal medulla; and 2) AVP-stimulated PI hydrolysis in the inner medulla is modulated by the osmolality of the extracellular fluid.\r"

Mice generated from this cross that carry both transgenes express IGF-I in the absence of GH. These mice grew larger than their GH-deficient transgenic littermates and exhibited weight and linear growth indistinguishable from that of their nontransgenic siblings. These results confirm the suspected role of IGF-I in mediating GH's stimulation of somatic growth, including that of long bones, and illustrates the essential role of GH and IGF-I in the modulation of postnatal growth. Analysis of differences in organ growth among these mice, however, suggests that GH and IGF-I also have growth promoting actions that are independent of one another; GH appears to be necessary for the attainment of normal liver size, while IGF-I can stimulate brain growth.\r"

  ".W": "Bovine placental lactogen (bPL) is a glycoprotein hormone that has both somatogenic and lactogenic properties. Purified preparations of the hormone contain many isoforms that are separated by isoelectric focusing. The sequence for bPL contains one consensus site for an N-linked oligosaccharide and many potential sites for O-linked sugars. To determine whether the isoforms are the result of differences in glycosylation, the oligosaccharide portion of bPL was partially characterized. In addition, a number of the isoforms were isolated and enzymatically deglycosylated to determine the effect of O- and N-linked glycosylation on biological activity. Biological activity was assessed in a somatotropin radioreceptor assay and also in the Nb2 lymphoma lactogenic bioassay. The structure of N-linked oligosaccharide was found to be sialylated and triantennary and appeared to be the same for all of the different charge isomers. Compositional analysis suggested that O-linked oligosaccharides were also present. Treatment of the intact hormone with neuraminidase resulted in the loss of some, but not all, of the isoforms, suggesting that a large degree of the charge heterogeneity is due to posttranslational modifications unrelated to glycosylation. Enzymatic removal of N-linked oligosaccharides from native bPL resulted in a 1.2-2.3-fold increase in binding to the somatotropin receptor, whereas receptor binding was unaffected by enzymatic removal of O-linked oligosaccharide. Lactogenic activity was affected very little by the removal of either type of oligosaccharide. The data suggests that glycosylation of bPL may have a small effect on receptor specificity, but that overall its presence does not dramatically affect receptor binding or biological activity.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies in rats have shown that the ratio anterior pituitary nuclear L-triiodothyronine (T3) derived from intracellular deiodination of L-thyroxine [T3(T4)]/plasma T3(T4) is much greater than for exchangeable T3 [T3(T3)]. We have addressed the hypothesis that T3(T4) is either selectively accumulated or selectively retained by nuclei in comparison to exchangeable T3 [T3(T3)] in cultured GC cells. GC cells readily generated T3 from T4. When mean medium T3(T4) was experimentally maintained at a low percentage (less than 16%) of total medium T3, to mimic in vivo conditions, nuclear T3(T4) was 2-fold greater than nuclear T3(T3) and the nuclear: medium ratio for T3(T4) was 11-13-fold greater than for T3(T3). The t1/2 of release of nuclear T3(T4) and T3(T3) were indistinguishable from one another and both sources of T3 distributed similarly between the nuclear and cytosol compartments. Thus, in agreement with previous in vivo studies, T3(T4) is derived from cellular T4 and is a significant source of nuclear T3 in GC cells. No evidence for a separate nonexchangeable T3(T4) pool was found as the almost identical cellular distribution and release rates of T3(T4) and T3(T3) from nuclei suggest that T3(T4) generated in these pituitary tumor cells is fully exchangeable. Our findings suggest that the high concentration of T3(T4) in the nuclear fraction is the result of a high intracellular production rate of T3 from T4 relative to the rate of release of T3 from the cell.\r"

From weeks 3 to 6 of pregnancy, P exhibited a conspicuous and statistically significant diurnal pattern (P less than 0.05), its serum concentration being approximately twice as high at 8:00 am as at 3:00 pm. A similar but nonsignificant trend was observed weeks 2, 7, and 8, and the overall ratio of the am/pm P concentrations was 2.4 +/- 0.28 (P less than 0.001). Rlx, E2, and PRL did not show a diurnal pattern at any time during pregnancy. The glandular sources and regulation of secretion of Rlx were further investigated. Rlx bioactivity was detected in canine placentas and ovaries, providing supportive evidence that these organs may be a dual source of the hormone in canine pregnancy. Injection of ovine PRL in three pseudopregnant bitches significantly increased serum P concentration as compared with seven untreated pseudopregnant controls, but Rlx was not detectable in serum before, during or after PRL treatment. The data support the view that Rlx and P are independently regulated in the bitch; PRL may be a regulator of P, but not of Rlx secretion. However, as PRL showed no diurnal changes in concentration, it does not appear to be directly responsible for the diurnal pattern exhibited by P.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the effects of a series of di- and trivalent cations on various aspects of parathyroid function to investigate whether these polyvalent cations act on the parathyroid cell through a similar mechanism. Like high extracellular concentrations of Ca2+, high levels of barium (Ba2+), strontium (Sr2+), gadolinium (Gd3+), europium (Eu3+), terbium (Tb3+), and yttrium (Yt3+) each inhibited low calcium-stimulated PTH release and showed IC50 values (the concentration producing half of the maximal inhibitory effect) of 1.12 mM, 1.18 mM, 2.2 microM, 2.5 microM, 0.89 microM, and 15 microM, respectively. The inhibitory effects of both divalent (Ca2+ and Ba2+) and trivalent (Gd3+) cations were reversible by 76-100% after removal of the cation, suggesting that the polyvalent cation-mediated reduction in PTH release was not due to nonspecific toxicity. The same di- and trivalent cations produced an 80-90% decrease in agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation with a similar order of potency as for their effects on PTH release. Preincubation overnight with pertussis toxin totally prevented the inhibitory effects of the trivalent cations on cAMP accumulation. The same di- and trivalent cations also increased the accumulation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate. Their effects on this parameter differed from those on PTH release and cAMP accumulation in several respects. First, Ba2+ and Sr2+, rather than being equipotent with Ca2+, were about 2-fold less potent in increasing the levels of inositol phosphates. Second, the trivalent cations were 5-50-fold less potent in raising inositol phosphates than in modulating PTH release and cAMP accumulation, and all were nearly equipotent. These results show that trivalent cations of the lanthanide series mimic the actions of divalent cations on several aspects of parathyroid function, and likely do so by interacting with the cell surface \"Ca2(+)-receptor-like mechanism\" through which extracellular Ca2+ has been postulated to act. The pharmacology of the effects of these polyvalent cations on cAMP and PTH release are similar and differ from that for their actions on inositol phosphate metabolism, raising the possibility that there might be more than one form of the putative Ca2+ receptor.\r"

One to 4% of the perfused 125I-ECBP and 125I-IGFBP-1 crossed the capillary boundary. The ECBPs predominantly localized as intact 125I-BP in connective tissue elements of the heart with less 125I-BP in cardiac muscle. The ratio of 125I-ECBP in connective tissue: muscle (normalized to percent vol of these compartments) was greater than or equal to 10:1. In contrast, the IGFBP-1 had a greater affinity for cardiac muscle with ratios of 125I-IGFBP-1 in connective tissue:muscle of approximately 1:2. When 125I-IGF-I, in the absence of any BPs, was perfused through the hearts approximately 3-5% left the microcirculation and was found in subendothelial tissues. 125I-IGF-I localized primarily to cardiac muscle with a distribution of connective tissue:cardiac muscle of about 1:3. The findings in the isolated perfused heart were confirmed in intact animals. After 125I-IGFBP-1 was injected into anesthetized rats and allowed to circulate for 5 min, substantial radioactivity was associated with the heart. As in the isolated heart, the IGFBP-1 preferentially localized to cardiac muscle with a connective tissue:cardiac muscle ratio of 1:3. We conclude that IGFBPs produced by endothelial cells and the IGFBP-1 contained in amniotic fluid can cross the capillary boundaries of the rat heart, and that the ECBPs preferentially localize in connective tissue elements of the myocardium, whereas IGFBP-1 predominantly localizes in cardiac muscle.\r"

Our previous studies identified two classes of dexamethasone-binding sites on male rat liver nuclear envelopes: a low capacity, high affinity site and a high capacity, low affinity site. The affinity reagent, [3H]dexamethasone mesylate, labeled peptides at 35-85 kDa, which may be the low affinity glucocorticoid-binding peptides, as these peptides showed the same response to hormonal manipulation as the low affinity [3H]dexamethasone-binding sites previously characterized. With dexamethasone mesylate and a monoclonal antibody against the glucocorticoid receptor, we have confirmed that the high affinity binding site on the nuclear envelope is the glucocorticoid receptor. Affinity labeling revealed the presence of a doublet of peptides at 85 and 110 kDa, in the same mol wt range as that reported for the glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, these affinity-labeled peptides responded to hormonal manipulation like nuclear glucocorticoid receptors. The monoclonal antibody identified a doublet of peptides, a major component of 92-94 kDa and a minor component of 98 kDa. Again, both peptides responded to hormonal manipulation like nuclear glucocorticoid receptors. The nuclear envelope-associated glucocorticoid receptor is not extracted by 0.1 M NaCl or 1% Triton X-100. These results show that glucocorticoid hormone interacts with the nuclear envelope via binding to the transformed glucocorticoid receptor, lending support to the two-step model of steroid hormone action.\r"

  ".U": "90353244\r", 
  ".W": "In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that FSH is a primary regulator of testicular inhibin production. However, recent reports suggest that LH may also promote inhibin secretion in vivo. To investigate whether LH regulates inhibin subunit messenger RNA (mRNA) expression as well, we examined the effects of hypophysectomy and LH replacement on the testicular content of inhibin alpha and beta-B subunit mRNAs in sexually immature and adult rats. Twenty- and 60-day-old intact and hypophysectomized rats received saline or 0.25, 2.5, 25.0, or 250 micrograms ovine LH/100 g body wt sc, twice daily for 7 days beginning on the day after hypophysectomy (n = 5/group in three separate experiments). The inhibin subunit mRNA content of each testis was measured for statistical analysis by dot-blot hybridization, and experimental results were confirmed by northern analysis of poly(A) RNA from each sample. In immature animals, the testicular content of both inhibin subunit mRNAs was decreased after hypophysectomy; inhibin alpha and beta-B mRNA levels were decreased to 6.9 +/- 0.9% and 31.7 +/- 2.7% of intact control values, respectively. In adult animals, hypophysectomy resulted in a more modest decrease in inhibin alpha subunit mRNA per testis (44.9 +/- 3.1% of controls) but had no effect on beta-B subunit mRNA. Replacement of LH to immature hypophysectomized animals did not alter levels of mRNA for either inhibin subunit. However, in adults LH restored testicular inhibin alpha subunit mRNA content in testes of hypophysectomized animals to levels seen in intact, saline-treated control animals. LH replacement also slightly but consistently decreased testicular beta-B subunit mRNA content compared to levels seen in hypophysectomized, saline-treated rats. These results indicate that although the response of inhibin subunit mRNAs to pituitary input decreases as a function of sexual maturation, LH may play an important role in regulation of inhibin subunit mRNA expression in adult but not immature testes. The mechanism(s) of LH action on testicular inhibin subunit gene expression is currently unknown, but may involve either direct actions of LH on Leydig cell inhibin subunit mRNAs or indirect actions of interstitial cell factors on Sertoli cell inhibin subunit gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "90353245\r", 
  ".W": "We previously have observed that dexamethasone has a biphasic effect on surfactant protein A (SP-A) mRNA levels in human fetal lung in vitro. At concentrations of 10(-10)-10(-9) M, dexamethasone increases the levels of SP-A mRNA, whereas, at concentrations greater than 10(-8) M, the steroid is markedly inhibitory. In studies to define the molecular mechanisms for these effects, we observed that dexamethasone causes a dose-dependent stimulation of SP-A gene transcription, but paradoxically causes a dose-dependent inhibition of SP-A mRNA stability. In light of the well-characterized inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on prostaglandin (PG) synthesis in a number of tissues, it was our objective in the present study to investigate the role of PGs on SP-A gene expression in human fetal lung in vitro and to determine whether the action of dexamethasone (greater than 10(-8) M) to reduce SP-A mRNA levels could be mediated by its effect to inhibit PG synthesis. We found that dexamethasone 10(-7) M) caused a marked decrease in the secreted levels of the PGE2 and PGF2 alpha, the prostacyclin metabolite, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and the thromboxane A2 metabolite, thromboxane B2. Indomethacin, which also caused a pronounced reduction in the levels of these secreted prostanoids, had a marked effect to reduce SP-A mRNA levels in human fetal lung in vitro. The inhibitory effects of indomethacin were associated with an 73% reduction in cAMP formation by the fetal lung in culture, and were prevented by simultaneous incubation with dibutyryl cAMP or with PGE2. PGE2 markedly increased cAMP formation by the human fetal lung tissue incubated in the absence or presence of indomethacin. Inhibitory effects of dexamethasone and indomethacin also were observed on two morphological indices of lung differentiation, alveolar lumenal volume density, and lamellar body volume density. PGE2 significantly increased lumenal volume density of the human fetal lung explants. The finding that the inhibitory action of dexamethasone (10(-7) M) on SP-A mRNA levels could not be prevented by simultaneous incubation with either PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP and that dexamethasone had no apparent effect on cAMP formation by the fetal lung in vitro is suggestive that the action of dexamethasone (greater than or equal to 10(-8) M) to reduce SP-A mRNA levels is mediated at least in part by actions alternative to its inhibitory effects on PG synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90353246\r", 
  ".W": "Progesterone, which is normally produced in the endoplasmic reticulum, was found to be rapidly degraded in the cytosolic fraction of the guinea pig adrenal cortex in vitro. Assuming this finding reflects what happens in vivo raises a question as to the source of progesterone for interacting with a nuclear progesterone-binding protein (P4-BP) that exists in this model system. It was subsequently found that pregnenolone, which in contrast to progesterone is relatively stable in the cytosol, was converted to progesterone by endogenous nuclear 3 beta-ol dehydrogenase. It was also determined that the nuclear-derived progesterone specifically bound to the nuclear P4-BP which is distinct from the classical progesterone receptor. The guinea pig adrenocortical cytosol contains a specific pregnenolone-binding protein (P5-BP) that could be virtue of its pregnenolone binding activity regulate the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone in the nuclear compartment and thereby reduce the binding of progesterone to the nuclear P4-BP. A partially purified P5-BP preparation markedly inhibited the nuclear conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone and reduced the binding of progesterone to the nuclear P4-BP (P5-BP did not directly inhibit binding of progesterone to the nuclear P4-BP). The ability of P5-BP to inhibit the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone was destroyed by heat and alkaline phosphatase treatment. The binding of pregnenolone to the P5-BP, as previously reported, is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, and alkaline phosphatase-treated P5-BP loses the ability to bind pregnenolone; this process can be reversed by a cytosolic kinase. This provides a mechanism for controlled release of bound steroid. These results suggest that P5-BP regulates the nuclear conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone and thus the binding of progesterone to the nuclear P4-BP.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was designed to characterize the developmental pattern of 5 alpha-reductase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and enzyme activity in intact medial basal hypothalamic (MBH) and preoptic area (POA) tissue fragments of rats during fetal development. 5 alpha-Reductase activity was determined using [3H]testosterone as the substrate and quantifying, by TLC, the radiolabeled 5 alpha-reduced metabolites (dihydrotestosterone [DHT] and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol). Confirmation of the identity of the [3H]5 alpha-DHT formed was demonstrated by recrystallization of the derivatized DHT to constant specific activity. Under saturating substrate conditions (1.7 microM testosterone), there were no significant sex differences (male vs. female) detected in neural 5 alpha-reductase during prenatal, perinatal, or neonatal development. 5 alpha-Reductase activity was low but detectable at gestational day (GD) 15 (approximately 10 pmol/h.mg protein), increased over 3-fold to peak levels at GD 18, and then declined to moderate levels at GD 22 (approximately 22 pmol/h.mg protein) and 4 days after birth (approximately 17 pmol/h.mg protein). In addition, the developmental pattern of 5 alpha-reductase mRNA expression in fetal MBH-POA tissue was determined, by RNA blot hybridization, using a complementary DNA encoding the rat 5 alpha-reductase enzyme. A single mRNA species was detected at 2.5 kilobase in MBH-POA tissue, which is similar in size to adult rat liver and prostate 5 alpha-reductase mRNA. At GD 15, 5 alpha-reductase mRNA was clearly detectable; the abundance increased on GD 17, remained at maximal levels at GDs 18, 19, and 20, and then decreased to moderate levels on GD 22. A correlation calculated between the normalized 5 alpha-reductase mRNA levels and enzyme activities revealed a strong correspondence between mRNA abundance and enzyme activity values during prenatal development, r = 0.80, P = 0.056. These findings indicate that neural 5 alpha-reductase activity may be developmentally regulated, and that the changes in 5 alpha-reductase activity in MBH-POA tissue during late fetal development are regulated, in part, by the levels of mRNA encoding the 5 alpha-reductase enzyme.\r"

While progesterone (P4) had no effect on MOR levels, RU486 increased (t1/2 6-12 h) MOR levels both in D and P segments, particularly in days 12-17, and the levels in the P segment equaled those in the D segment. Estradiol had no effect on MOR levels in days 20-22; in days 16-19 estradiol increased MOR levels particularly in the P segment, and the levels in the latter were higher than in the D segment. Capillary plasma P4 levels were higher in P vs. in D myometrial segments. These results indicate, in the pregnant rat, a local uterine control of D greater than P MOR expression by P4 withdrawal beginning in day 18. We hypothesize that the D greater than P MOR expression determines a role for oxytocin in initiating myometrial contractions in the D segment, while in active labor another class of agent(s) assume that function in more proximal segments.\r"

Plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides are unchanged in hyperthyroid rats. Liver apo-A-I mRNA levels increase 3-fold, whereas intestinal apo-A-I mRNA levels remain constant. Plasma apo-A-I levels almost double after L-T4. Liver apo-B and apo-E and intestinal apo-B mRNA levels are not influenced by L-T4, but plasma apo-B and apo-E decrease significantly. In the liver, apo-A-II mRNA levels decrease, whereas LDL receptor mRNA levels increase more than 50%. HTGL mRNA is not influenced by L-T4. N-Propyl-thiouracil-induced hypothyroidism does not influence plasma triglycerides, but plasma cholesterol levels nearly double. Liver and intestinal apo-A-I mRNA levels and plasma apo-A-I concentrations remain constant after propylthiouracil treatment. Accompanying the increase in plasma apo-B, liver and intestinal apo-B mRNA concentrations rise by approximately 100% and 40%, respectively. Plasma apo-E increases nearly 2-fold, but liver, apo-A-II mRNA rises, whereas HTGL and LDL receptor mRNA levels decrease 20% and nearly 50%, respectively. In conclusion, thyroid hormones regulate rat apo-A-I and apo-A-II gene expression in opposite directions. Furthermore, the LDL receptor is regulated at the mRNA level, whereas HTGL gene expression is relatively resistant to alterations in thyroid status.\r"

  ".W": "Cytochrome P450s, proteins involved in metabolism of sterols, steroids, and a variety of foreign compounds, have been grouped into families based on amino acid sequence. We have identified a microsomal cytochrome P450 in guinea pig adrenal immunochemically related to P450c,d (P450I), induced in rat liver by methylcholanthrene. The inner zone localization, male predominance, and suppression by ACTH of this protein correspond to the ability of the adrenal microsomes to metabolize ethylmorphine. Its immunoreactivity, localization, and regulation distinguish it from P450(17) alpha (P450XVII) and P450(21) (P450XXI), known microsomal steroid hydroxylases. To examine whether other cytochrome P450s homologous to those in liver might be present in the guinea pig adrenal, microsomes were reacted with antibodies to hepatic P450s from families II and III. Each probe detected proteins in microsomes, but not in mitochondria, which were in the lower mol wt range of cytochrome P450s (47-50K). The immunoreactivity of all was diminished in animals treated with spironolactone, a compound which destroys cytochrome P450s in the adrenal, but not in liver. All were present in both outer and inner zones and in both males and females. None was suppressed by ACTH in the inner zone. Thus, only the previously described 52K protein reactive with anti-P450I corresponds in both distribution and ACTH response to the capacity for xenobiotic metabolism in guinea pig adrenal microsomes. On the other hand, unlike the 52K protein, the newly discovered proteins related to P450s II and III were all suppressed in the outer zone following dexamethasone treatment, suggesting that they might be related to dexamethasone-suppressible functions, such as metabolism of sterols and steroids.\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were performed in conscious rabbits with sectioned aortic depressor nerves to determine whether there is an interaction between angiotensin II (Ang II) and the baroreceptor reflexes in the control of arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion. Baroreceptor reflexes were activated by a 5- or 10-min period of bilateral carotid occlusion with or without background infusion of Ang II at 10 or 20 ng/kg.min. Carotid occlusion increased mean arterial pressure, right atrial pressure, and heart rate, but did not change plasma AVP (PAVP) concentration. Infusion of Ang II at 10 ng/kg.min increased PAVP from 4.0 +/- 0.9 to 6.3 +/- 1.8 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). Carotid occlusion during Ang II infusion produced the same cardiovascular changes as before Ang II, but still failed to increase PAVP. Because increased atrial pressure can inhibit AVP secretion, the experiments were repeated in acutely vagotomized rabbits. Vagotomy increased heart rate but did not change mean arterial pressure or PAVP. Carotid occlusion after vagotomy increased PAVP from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 0.5 pg/ml (P less than 0.05). Ang II infusion again increased PAVP but did not enhance the AVP response to carotid occlusion (2.9 +/- 0.4 to 3.9 +/- 0.7 pg/ml). These results provide further evidence for a role of the carotid sinus baroreceptors and vagal afferents in the control of AVP secretion and demonstrate that Ang II stimulates AVP secretion in rabbits. However, they do not reveal any interaction between Ang II and the baroreceptor reflexes in the control of AVP secretion.\r"

This Ca+2-dependent activity did not require the addition of phospholipid and was only minimally affected by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration, suggesting that endogenous phospholipid activation was not responsible for this activity. The addition of phospholipid in the presence of Ca+2 revealed an additional activity in these homogenates which probably represents the Ca+2-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase-C). The diabetic state did not appear to alter that activity. The Ca+2-dependent protein kinase was sensitive to agents known to inhibit calmodulin-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase-C. The IC50 values of the inhibitors for the Ca+2-dependent protein kinase, however, differed from those reported for the other two kinases.\r"

Kinetic studies showed that the stimulation of the 5'-D by T3 was associated with an increase in maximum velocity (Vmax) in [11.9 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SE) and 25.4 +/- 0.9 pmol I-released/mg protein.min, respectively, in control and cultured with 10(-9) M T3 for four days] but without a change in apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) (94.8 +/- 5.3 nM and 105.4 +/- 12.1 nM, respectively). Furthermore, cycloheximide (5 microM) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of T3 on the 5'-D activity. T3 and T4 also enhanced the 5'-D activity stimulated by TSH in a dose-dependent manner. Kinetic studies showed that the stimulatory effect of T3 on the 5'-D stimulated by TSH was again associated with an increase in Vmax (86.0 +/- 4.0 and 166.5 +/- 1.9 pmol I- released/mg protein.min, respectively, cultured with 0.3 U/liter TSH and cultured with TSH plus 10(-9) M T3 for four days) without a change in apparent Km (114.0 +/- 7.4 nM and 111.6 +/- 12.5 nM, respectively). Cycloheximide (5 microM) completely abolished the stimulatory effect of TSH plus T3 on the 5'-D activity. There were no significant differences observed between cells cultured with TSH and with TSH plus T3 in either the intra- or extracellular cAMP contents. Furthermore, T3 enhanced the 5'-D activity stimulated by (Bu)2 cAMP. These results strongly suggest that T3 or T4 was synergistic with TSH in stimulating the 5'-D activity in FRTL-5 cells, and that cAMP production would be an important component of the synergism.\r"

Previously we have reported that interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibits Leydig cell androgen production. In the present study, the effect of IL-2 was investigated. Leydig cells (10(5) cells/ml) from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured with or without IL-2 for 24 h. After medium changes, human CG (hCG), 8-bromo-cAMP, or forskolin was added with or without IL-2. Cultures were continued for an additional 24 h, and testosterone and cAMP levels were measured. IL-2 up to 100 U/ml had no effect on basal testosterone production. hCG-stimulated testosterone formation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the addition of IL-2. IL-2 in a concentration of 100 U/ml decreased hCG-induced testosterone formation from 49.6 +/- 3.6 ng/ml (mean +/- SE) to 8.5 +/- 4.2 ng/ml. The hCG dose-response curve was shifted to the right by the addition of IL-2. Maximal testosterone production in response to hCG was reduced 40% in the presence of IL-2 (50 U/ml) without alteration of median effective dose (ED50). IL-2 also inhibited hCG-induced cAMP formation and 8-bromo cAMP- and forskolin-stimulated testosterone production. However, IL-2 did not alter the binding of [125I]hCG to purified Leydig cells. Furthermore, IL-2 significantly inhibited the conversion of 20-OH-cholesterol, 22-OH-cholesterol, pregnenolone, progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to testosterone but did not alter the conversion of dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione to testosterone. Our results suggest that a T cell growth factor, IL-2, is a potent inhibitor of steroidogenesis. IL-2 may play a paracrine role in modulating Leydig cell function.\r"

  ".W": "The impact of photoperiodic manipulations and testosterone treatments on the adipocyte alpha 2-adrenergic (alpha 2-AR), beta-adrenergic (beta-AR), and A1-adenosine (A1-R) responsiveness, was explored in male Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Moreover, binding studies were performed with appropriate alpha 2-AR, beta-AR, and A1-R radioligands to study receptor changes. Animals were kept for 12 weeks in long day photoperiod (LD: 16 h light (L)-8 h dark (D)), in short day photoperiod (SD: 6L-18D), or in short photoperiod with testosterone treatments (1 mg/animal/day sc) 10 days before sacrifice (SD+T). The antilipolytic effect of the full alpha 2-AR agonist UK14304 and the specific binding of the alpha 2-AR radioligands [3H] RX821002 (antagonist) and [3H]UK14304 were significantly reduced in SD hamsters compared with LD hamsters. The alpha 2-site number and alpha 2-AR responsiveness were completely restored in SD+T hamsters. Whatever the experimental conditions the adipocyte beta-AR receptivity (lipolytic response of isoproterenol and [125I]cyanopindolol binding), and the A1-R receptivity (antilipolytic response initiated by (-)phenylisopropyladenosine and [3H]dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine and [3H]phenylisopropyladenosine binding) remained unchanged. Moreover, the kidney and brain alpha 2-AR densities identified with [3H]RX821002 were not significantly different in LD, SD or SD+T hamsters. These results were obtained without any modification of animal weight, white adipose tissue weight, or white fat cell size. We conclude that, in the Syrian hamster, the expression of the adipocyte alpha 2-AR is under the control of the photoperiod by a testosterone-dependent mechanism probably mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, without any alteration of the animal fat stores.\r"

Coincubation of increasing concentrations of human (h) GH (0.14-4.5 nM) with 4.2 nM recombinant hGHBP-(1-247) in serum-free medium shifted the hGH dose-response curve to the right over the range 0.14-0.9 nM. When the hGH concentration was fixed at 0.45 nM, a dose-dependent inhibition of GH bioactivity was seen over the range of 0.1-11.3 nM GHBP, with an ED50 of 3 nM. The presence of serum had no effect on the inhibitory properties of GHBP. When 2% pooled human serum was added to incubation medium containing 0.45 nM hGH and GHBP (0.6 nM-5.7 nM), the effect of GHBP was again inhibitory, with an ED50 of 1.2 nM. Two percent serum alone was adipogenic, but at this low serum concentration it is likely that some factor other than GH is responsible. In a homologous receptor assay, the binding of [125I]hGH to IM-9 lymphocytes was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by increasing concentrations of hGHBP in the physiological range, providing further support for the idea that GHBP can regulate the bioactivity of GH by blocking the binding of free GH to target tissues in vivo. Our results suggest that one function of GHBP is to dampen the biological effects of pulsatile GH secretion by reducing free GH during secretory pulses. This effect combined with an increased half-life of circulating GH would have the effect of flattening the hormone secretory profile at the target tissue level.\r"

Reduction of plasma calcium was shown to be a function of early (5 h) neutralization of PLP bioactivity in the kidney, whereas the effect of immunoneutralization of PLP in bone appeared later (24-48 h) and was more prolonged. Immunization against PTH in normocalcemic animals resulted in a hypocalcemic episode of smaller magnitude and shorter duration than that achieved in hypercalcemic animals immunized against PLP and appeared to be unassociated with neutralization of distal tubular effects. Neutralization of proximal tubular and skeletal actions of PTH appeared to occur in a manner analogous to that seen for PLP in tumor-bearing animals, but were of shorter duration. These studies suggest that in normal animals the action of PTH in the skeleton and/or on vitamin D metabolism contributes considerably more than renal transport activity to the maintenance of normocalcemia and that compensatory mechanisms rapidly restore homeostasis. PTH appears to be the major modulator of calcium homeostasis in normal rats, with PLP playing a minor role, if any. In tumor-bearing rats, mechanisms to restore calcium levels to baseline are delayed after PLP immunoneutralization, and PLP appears to be both necessary and sufficient for the hypercalcemic state.\r"

  ".U": "90353273\r", 
  ".W": "Chromogranin-A, also referred to as secretory protein-I, is a 50-kDa protein present in and secreted by most endocrine cells together with the native hormone. Porcine chromogranin-A contains a sequence identical to pancreastatin, suggesting that it is the precursor of pancreastatin. Pancreastatin is a potent inhibitor of parathyroid gland secretion, and it and chromogranin-A inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin release by the pancreas. It is possible that chromogranin-A, pancreastatin, or a related peptide is a physiological inhibitor of secretion by the parathyroid as well as other endocrine glands. As a test of this hypothesis, parathyroid cells in culture were incubated with purified porcine chromogranin-A or antisera to chromogranin-A and pancreastatin. In the absence of exogenous chromogranin-A or antisera, secretion of chromogranin-A and PTH at 0.5 mM Ca2+ was about twice that at 3.0 mM Ca2+. When intact chromogranin-A was added to the incubation medium at 0.5 mM Ca2+, secretion was reduced to the basal level obtained at 3.0 mM Ca2+. Chromogranin-A did not affect the secretion of cells incubated at 3.0 mM Ca2+. At 1 h of incubation, 100 nM chromogranin-A was equivalent in potency to 1 nM pancreastatin, but after 3 h the two agents were equipotent. This suggests that chromogranin-A was processed into biologically active peptide(s) during incubation. Antisera directed against chromogranin-A or pancreastatin potentiated the secretion of both chromogranin-A and PTH at 0.5 mM, but not 3.0 mM, Ca2+. This stimulatory action of the antisera was dose dependent from 1:3200 to 1:400 final dilution, was effective within 2 h, and did not shift the Ca2+ set-point for glandular secretion. These results are consonant with chromogranin-A-derived peptides serving as an autocrine inhibitor of parathyroid gland secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Estrogen is important for both the sexual dimorphism of the skeleton during growth and the maintenance of bone balance in adults. This report describes the in vivo effects of estrogen on bone formation and gene expression in the tibial diaphysis of ovariectomized rats. Rats were ovariectomized at 8 weeks of age and were given diethylstilbestrol (DES) or placebo 1 week later as sc sustained release pellets. Histomorphometry revealed that that the periosteal bone formation and apposition rates were reduced at the tibial diaphysis 1 week after beginning estrogen treatment and further reduced after 2 weeks. Interestingly, DES treatment had no effect on endosteal bone formation, but suppressed endosteal bone resorption. Northern analysis of freshly isolated periosteal cells from tibiae and femora revealed that DES treatment resulted in dramatic decreases in steady state mRNA levels for the bone matrix proteins osteocalcin, prepro alpha 2(I) chain of type 1 collagen, osteonectin, and osteopontin as well as the osteoblast marker enzyme alkaline phosphatase. The results suggest that the inhibitory effects of estrogen on radial bone growth in rats are mediated, or at least accompanied, by the inhibition of the expression of bone matrix protein genes in periosteal cells.\r"

  ".W": "The alpha-subunit gene of the glycoprotein hormones is normally expressed in pituitary thyrotropes and gonadotropes and in placental cells. Thus, this gene must contain elements that mediate expression and hormonal responses in different cell types. The localization of DNA regions important for expression and regulation of the alpha-subunit gene in thyrotrope cells has not previously been reported. In these studies luciferase expression constructs containing 1700 basepairs of 5' flanking DNA derived from the mouse alpha-subunit gene were introduced by electroporation into freshly dispersed cells from TSH-producing mouse pituitary tumors (TtT 97). This promoter functioned with greater efficiency in thyrotropes than in nonthyrotrope pituitary GH4 cells and L-cell fibroblasts. Primer extension confirmed that transcription from the alpha-subunit constructs initiated at the same site as the endogenous gene. Studies using 5' truncations showed a progressive loss of alpha-subunit promoter activity in thyrotropes between -480 and -120, with regions upstream of -254 contributing substantially to expression in thyrotrope cells. Thyroid hormone inhibited alpha-subunit promoter activity in a dose-dependent fashion, although in vivo treatment of tumors with thyroid hormone before transfection was necessary to achieve maximal inhibition. Thyroid hormone inhibition of alpha-subunit promoter activity also occurred in GH4 cells, but no effect was observed in L-cells. Studies using 5' truncations localized a region responsible for thyroid hormone inhibition between -62 and +43, encompassing the TATA sequence and the transcriptional initiation site. When this region was compared to the thyroid hormone inhibitory regions of the alpha-subunit genes from other species and the mouse TSH beta-subunit gene, a 6-basepair motif, 5' (G/A)GTG(G/A)G 3', emerged as a possible consensus sequence for a thyroid hormone inhibitory element.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that interleukin-1 possesses not only immunoregulatory action, but also multiple hormone like effects. We studied the action of recombinant interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) on the synthesis of thyroglobulin (TG), the precursor of thyroid hormone. Human thyrocytes dispersed from normal and Graves' thyroid tissues were incubated with TSH with or without IL-1 beta. TSH stimulated TG release from cultured human thyrocytes after 4 days. This effect was mimicked by dibutyryl cAMP (dBcAMP). IL-1 beta had no effect on basal TG release but modulates the TSH-stimulated TG secretion. At low dose (10(-5) to 10(-3) U/ml) IL-1 beta increased the TSH-stimulated TG secretion while higher doses (1-100 U/ml) of IL-1 beta had an inhibitory effect. Similar responses were observed with both normal and Graves' thyrocytes. The effect of IL-1 beta occurred at the gene transcription level as reflected by changes in TG mRNA level. At 100 U/ml, IL-1 beta suppressed TG mRNA level to near unmeasurable level. This biphasic effect of IL-1 beta on TG synthesis is paralleled by a similar change in TSH-stimulated cAMP secretion. We conclude that IL-1 beta possesses hormonal action on TG gene transcription and its effect is mediated via cAMP.\r"

  ".W": "The enzyme complex delta 5-3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/delta 5-delta 4 isomerase (3 beta HSD) is involved in the biosynthesis of all classes of steroids, namely glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone, and sex steroids. To obtain information on the precise localization of 3 beta HSD in rat gonads and adrenal glands, two complementary cytochemical techniques were used; immunocytochemical localization was achieved with antibodies developed against purified human placental 3 beta HSD, while 3 beta HSD mRNA localization was achieved by in situ hybridization performed with a recently cloned rat 3 beta HSD cDNA. In the testis, specific immunostaining was restricted to the cytoplasm of the interstitial cells, while by in situ hybridization, specific silver grains were also seen over the interstitial cells. In the ovary, immunostaining was found in the cytoplasm of cells of the corpus luteum and theca interna, while the granulosa cells of the follicles showed no positive reaction. By in situ hybridization, a specific hybridization signal was observed over granulosa cells of the corpus luteum, which are mainly responsible for progesterone secretion, and to a lesser extent over theca interna cells, known for their role in secreting C19 androgens. In the adrenals, the three zones of the cortex were equally immunolabeled, whereas no staining could be detected in the medulla. Similarly, by in situ hybridization, silver grains were located over the zona glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis, while no specific autoradiographic reaction could be observed on the chromaffin cells of the medulla. The present study provides new information about the precise cellular localization of 3 beta HSD in the adrenal glands and gonads in the rat, thus providing useful information about the site of action of 3 beta HSD, especially in the gonads. Moreover, the approaches used for localization studies, especially quantitative in situ hybridization, should provide a useful tool for assessing the role of hormones on 3 beta HSD expression in the different compartments of the gonads and adrenal glands.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of the expression of the human corticotropin-releasing-hormone gene (hCRH) was studied in a mouse anterior pituitary cell line (AtT20) after transiently transfection with a chimeric gene containing the hCRH gene promoter fused to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Expression of the chimeric hCRH-CAT gene in AtT20 cells was enhanced by the cAMP analog (8-bromo-cAMP) about 5-fold but not by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine also strongly stimulated 15-fold the expression of the chimeric hCRH-CAT gene. Coincubation of cAMP analog and isobutylmethylxanthine resulted in a moderate 2-fold synergistic enhancement of CAT activity. Sequence comparison of the hCRH gene revealed a core sequence for a cAMP responsive element 5'-TGACGTCA-3' at -221 relative to the cap site. This regulatory element also confers cAMP inducibility on a heterologous promoter when placed upstream of the thymidine kinase promoter from herpes simplex virus. Finally, treatment with 0.5 microM dexamethasone reduced CAT activity about 2.0-fold in cAMP-stimulated cells. This result suggests that cAMP and glucocorticoids coordinately control hCRH gene expression.\r"

Different effects were observed after a step increase in osmolality and a gradual increase in the same amount over 24 h. The VP mRNA content of control HNS explants determined from a RNA protection assay was 22 +/- 6 pg. It gradually decreased to 23% and 9% of the control value during 24 and 48 h in culture, respectively. Northern blot analysis revealed a single band of VP mRNA approximately 700 bases long in explants cultured for 36 h. Explants exposed to the step increase in osmolality were maintained in static culture. The control explants were placed directly into isotonic medium (299 mosmol/kg H2O). The explants exposed to the step increase were placed directly into hypertonic medium (greater than 304 mosmol/kg H2O). After 24 h in culture, basal VP release was measured, and all explants were then exposed to a further acute 15 mosm/kg H2O increase in osmolality. The highest basal release of VP was observed in the explants maintained under isotonic conditions (299 mosm/kg H2O). These explants significantly increased VP release in response to the acute increase in osmolality. Basal VP release was lower in explants maintained in hypertonic medium (greater than 304 mosmol/kg H2O), and these explants did not respond to the acute hypertonic pulse. VP mRNA content was significantly decreased in explants maintained for 24 or 48 h in hypertonic medium compared to that in explants maintained in isotonic medium (47 +/- 10% and 57 +/- 6%, respectively; P less than 0.01). No significant difference existed in the VP content of the posterior pituitary between the groups. To achieve a slow increase in osmolality, explants were perifused in individual chambers with medium at 2.1 ml/h. A gradual increase in osmolality (16 mosmol/kg H2O medium) was achieved by increasing the NaCl concentration in the perifusion medium. In response to this stimulus there was a significant increase in VP release, which was sustained for 9 h. VP mRNA content in the hypertonic group was 165 +/- 19% of that in control explants (P less than 0.001), but no difference existed in VP content in the posterior pituitary compared to that in time control explants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90353286\r", 
  ".W": "The mechanism by which angiotensin-II (Ang II) stimulates aldosterone secretion from adrenal glomerulosa cells involves a phospholipase-C-mediated increase in phosphoinositide turnover and diacylglycerol (DAG) production. Because agonist-induced activation of phospholipase-D (PLD) also contributes to elevations in DAG in other cell types, the ability of Ang II to stimulate PLD activity in cultured bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells was examined. Ang II elicited significant increases in the levels of phosphatidic acid and, in the presence of ethanol, of phosphatidylethanol, a more specific marker for PLD activation. The potential role of this increased PLD activity in the regulation of aldosterone secretion was examined by investigating the ability of exogenous PLD to alter secretory rates. PLD alone dose-dependently increased aldosterone secretion from 5.9 +/- 0.5 to 135 +/- 48 pg/min.mg protein. In the presence of the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644, which by itself had only a modest effect on aldosterone production, the stimulatory action of PLD was enhanced, yielding a secretory rate (442 +/- 119 pg/min.mg protein) that was approximately 60% of that elicited by 10 nM Ang II (763 +/- 182 pg/min.mg protein). Exogenous PLD also induced a significant increase in DAG levels (from 0.76 +/- 0.03 to 1.10 +/- 0.1 nmol/mg protein), which was not altered by the addition of Bay K 8644. However, PLD did not stimulate inositol phosphate production. These data indicate that 1) Ang II activates PLD; 2) exogenous PLD can elevate aldosterone secretory rates and DAG levels without eliciting phosphoinositide hydrolysis; and 3) the stimulatory action of exogenous PLD on aldosterone secretion is enhanced in the presence of Bay K 8644. Thus, PLD-induced DAG production may play an important role in the Ang II-mediated stimulation of aldosterone secretion from the adrenal zona glomerulosa.\r"

Circulating concentrations of PTH-related protein (PTHRP) have not been reported in this or any other animal model of HHM. Taking advantage of the marked N-terminal amino acid homology between rodent and human PTHRPs, we have adapted a sensitive two-site immunoradiometric assay developed for measurement of human PTHRP for use in measuring rat PTHRP. Circulating calcium and PTHRP concentrations were serially measured after sc passage of the Leydig cell tumor in rats. Significant hypercalcemia and elevation of PTHRP occurred on day 9 after tumor inoculation. When grouped by tumor size, both plasma calcium and PTHRP levels were significantly elevated in animals with tumor burdens greater than 10 cc. The PTHRP concentration was strongly correlated with both serum calcium (r = 0.88) and tumor size (r = 0.80). Circulating rat PTHRP averaged 12.8 pM on day 9 and 27.5 pM on day 10 or 11. PTHRP was undetectable in the plasma of 19 control rats. In 3 rats, plasma calcium returned to normal, and PTHRP became undetectable within 24 h after tumor excision. Rat milk displayed a PTHRP concentration of 2000 pM, while acid-urea extract of the rat tumor contained 0.32 pmol/mg protein. Dilutions of rat plasma, milk, and tumor extract displayed response curves that were parallel to the human PTHRP-(1-74) standard in the assay. This two-site immunoradiometric assay is a sensitive and easily performed means of measuring rat PTHRP. It should be useful in studying this animal model of HHM and the function of PTHRP in normal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "In peripheral aldosterone target sites (e.g., kidney), 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta-OHSD) metabolizes corticosterone to inactive 11-dehydrocorticosterone and thus protects mineralocorticoid receptors from exposure to corticosterone in vivo. We have investigated whether 11 beta-OHSD could account for the site-specific differences in corticosteroid receptor sensitivity to corticosterone in rat brain. Enzyme activity, estimated as the percentage conversion of [3H]corticosterone to [3H]11-dehydrocorticosterone in the presence of NADP+ (200 microM), was: hippocampus, 55.8 +/- 2.7%; cortex, 52 +/- 3.1%; pituitary; 40 +/- 2%, hypothalamus, 26.1 +/- 1.2%; brain stem, 21.4 +/- 1.7%; and spinal cord, 12.3 +/- 1.8%. Northern blots, using [32P]dCTP-labeled probes from an 11 beta-OHSD cDNA clone derived from rat liver, showed expression of a single mRNA species in all brain areas, of identical size to 11 beta-OHSD mRNA in liver and kidney. Highest expression was found in hippocampus and cortex. In situ hybridization, using [35S]UTP-labeled cRNA probes, localized high mRNA expression to cerebral cortex (particularly parietal cortex, layer IV), hippocampus (highest in CA3), hypothalamic medial preoptic area and arcuate nuclei and anterior pituitary. In conclusion, there is localized 11 beta-OHSD mRNA expression and enzyme bioactivity in rat brain. The distribution of 11 beta-OHSD corresponds to areas of reduced glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptor affinity for corticosterone. Therefore, 11 beta-OHSD may regulate the access of corticosterone to cerebral mineralocorticoid and/or glucocorticoid receptors and thus modulate corticosteroid effects on brain function.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoid excess is associated with growth retardation in both man and experimental animals. We have previously reported that dexamethasone (DXM) inhibits growth hormone induction of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) mRNA in the hypophysectomized rat and reduces steady-state IGF-I mRNA levels in the intact rat. However, in these experiments, DXM had surprisingly little effect on serum IGF-I concentrations. Here, we have examined the effect of DXM on hepatic insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) mRNA levels and on serum IGFBP-1 concentrations. After a single ip injection of DXM, 6 micrograms/100 g body wt, IGFBP-1 mRNA increased 2.24 +/- 0.25-fold, P less than 0.05 at 1 h and declined to normal levels in 6-12 h. A dose-dependent increase in increased hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA abundance was seen in rats killed 1 h after an ip injection of DXM, 0.1 to 60 micrograms/100g body wt. As little as 1 microgram/100g body wt, significantly enhanced hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA levels; 2.02- +/- 0.38-fold, P less than 0.05. This effect appeared to be post-transcriptional, since IGFBP-1 transcription in hepatic nuclei from rats treated with DXM was not significantly different from untreated rats. When DXM, 1 microgram/rat, was administered daily for 6 days a significant increase in IGFBP-1 mRNA was detected; 2.02 +/- 0.39-fold, P less than 0.05. A more marked increase was seen with 6 and 60 micrograms/rat of DXM; 4.47 +/- 1.08- and 10.61 +/- 0.31-fold, respectively. Serum was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-plyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antisera raised against a synthetic peptide derived from the predicted sequence of rat IGFBP-1. The antisera recognized a doublet of approximately 30 kDa. A dose-dependent increase in the abundance of these BPs were seen in the serum from rats treated chronically with DXM. The observations reported here clearly demonstrate that DXM increases hepatic IGFBP-1 mRNA and serum IGFBP-1 concentrations. If IGFBP-1 functions to decrease the bioavailability of IGF-1 in vivo the enhanced expression of IGFBP-1 may be an additional mechanism whereby glucocorticoid excess results in growth retardation.\r"

  ".W": "The neuropeptides substance P, neuropeptide Y, neurotensin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide are present in normal rat anterior pituitary gland and hypothalamus and can influence the secretion of classical pituitary hormones. We investigated the effects of estrogen manipulation on pituitary and hypothalamic expression of these four peptides by specific RIAs and cDNA probe analysis. Surgical ovariectomy produced a significant rise in the pituitary content of substance P immunoreactivity (IR) (130.2 +/- 4.8 fmol/gland vs. control 29.1 +/- 2.2, P less than 0.001), neuropeptide Y IR (34.9 +/- 3.9 vs. 19.6 +/- 2.0, P less than 0.05) and neurotensin IR (85.1 +/- 8.2 vs. 62.4 +/- 7.2, P less than 0.05), while vasoactive intestinal peptide IR showed a fall (201.2 +/- 18.8 vs. 285.4 +/- 25.9, P less than 0.05). These patterns were reversed with estrogen replacement or high dose estrogen treatment. Changes in peptide content were accompanied by parallel changes in the mRNA for each peptide. Treatment with an antiestrogen (tamoxifen) resulted in no change in substance P, neuropeptide Y, and neurotensin expression, while vasoactive intestinal peptide IR content decreased to below the assay detection limit. Hypothalamic expression of these peptides did not change with any of the treatments. These results indicate that: 1) the control of the pituitary expression of the four peptides under the influence of estrogen occurs predominantly at the level of gene transcription and 2) normalization of the castration induced changes by exogenous estrogen replacement suggests the changes to be mediated by the absence of this steroid. The regulation of the pituitary expression of these peptides by estrogen support the possibility of their having an autocrine or paracrine role.\r"

  ".W": "Porcine 32,000 Mr inhibin is a glycoprotein with one asparagine-linked glycosylation site on the alpha-subunit. The presence of carbohydrate on the alpha-subunit was visualized by periodate-Schiff (PAS) staining. This stain for carbohydrate also verified that the beta-subunit of 32,000 Mr porcine inhibin does not contain carbohydrate. When analyzed by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-PAGE) under reducing conditions, the inhibin alpha-subunit consistently existed as a doublet, and by the PAS stain, both bands of the doublet were glycosylated. Analysis by two-dimensional (2D) PAGE further revealed the presence of charge isoforms of the alpha-subunit. The alpha-subunit of inhibin could be deglycosylated by N-glycanase, but not by endoglycosidase F, endoglycosidase D, or endoglycosidase H. When the N-glycanase-treated inhibin was analyzed by either 1D-PAGE or 2D-PAGE, the molecular size of the alpha-subunit was reduced by 3500 Mr. Each doublet band observed with reducing conditions in 1D-PAGE or 2D-PAGE for the alpha-subunit became a single band (spot) in the deglycosylated alpha-subunit. However, the charge heterogeneity detected by 2D-PAGE was retained, indicating that only a portion of this heterogeneity is attributable to the carbohydrate moiety. The in vitro biological activity of the deglycosylated inhibin was not different from the control sample. The composition of the carbohydrate in inhibin was investigated with the Dionex carbohydrate analyzer. Inhibin contains fucose, glucosamine, galactose, mannose, and glucose. Colorimetric analysis revealed the presence of sialic acid. Taken together, this implies some aspect of the peptide portion of the molecule is involved in charge heterogeneity. Inhibin may have an unusual carbohydrate component, as evidenced by the detection of glucose in inhibin samples. The absence of glucose in the carbohydrate moiety of another glycoprotein fraction that accompanied the inhibin through all the same fractionation procedures argues against the artifactual introduction of glucose in the fractionation medium per se.\r"

  ".U": "90353294\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies in rats have demonstrated that 1) aldosterone enhances biosynthesis of renal flavin coenzymes; 2) riboflavin analogs inhibit the synthesis of aldosterone; and 3) adriamycin inhibits flavin coenzyme biosynthesis. In their entirety, these findings suggest that both diminished flavin coenzyme biosynthesis induced by adriamycin and a dietary riboflavin deficiency would result in decreased formation of aldosterone. The present study examined the effects of adriamycin treatment on serum aldosterone in rats consuming either a diet adequate in riboflavin or a riboflavin-deficient diet. Groups of rats fed specially prepared diets were injected for 3 days with adriamycin (cumulative dose range, 6-24 mg/kg BW). Pair-fed controls were given saline. After death, adrenal glands were excised, and blood samples were analyzed for aldosterone levels. No changes in adrenal weights or protein and potassium concentrations were observed after adriamycin treatment. In contrast to initial predictions, in riboflavin-sufficient rats, serum aldosterone levels were markedly enhanced by adriamycin in a dose-related manner. Riboflavin-deficient animals had lower basal aldosterone levels and markedly attenuated responses to adriamycin than did riboflavin-sufficient rats. In separate groups of adriamycin-treated rats fed a normal chow diet, serum aldosterone levels increased, and serum corticosterone levels showed a small but significant decline. In addition, adriamycin treatment caused an increase in urinary potassium excretion and a decrease in sodium excretion. These results suggest that flavins play a decisive role in regulating the levels of aldosterone and raise the possibility that the adriamycin-induced increase in serum aldosterone may be part of the pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity and overall muscular weakness.\r"

  ".W": "Analytical ion microscopy was used to evaluate the quantitative changes in thyroid 127I mapping induced by amiodarone in relation to the iodine intake. Mice were maintained on a normal diet (NID), on a low iodine diet (LID) or on a high iodine diet (HID) during 3 months. They received daily ip injections of amiodarone or NaI during the last 10 days. Microanalysis of iodine was performed on thyroid sections. In NID mice, the cellular 127I concentration (mean +/- SE: 0.90 +/- 0.06 micrograms/mg) was lower than that of follicular lumina (6.99 +/- 0.17). Amiodarone increased cellular concentration (2-fold) and decreased follicular concentration; NaI induced the same results. In LID mice, both concentrations, which were decreased 60- to 70-fold in comparison with NID, were restored by amiodarone, while NaI enhanced follicular concentration more than amiodarone. In HID mice, the follicular concentration (1.5-fold higher than normal) returned to a normal range with amiodarone, but cellular concentration (2.5-fold lower than normal) remained low, while NaI increased the cellular concentration 3-fold. These data show that iodine released by amiodarone has a bioavailability different from that of NaI. They indicate that thyroid response to amiodarone is related to dietary iodine intake, which, in turn, determines autoregulatory mechanisms. They also raise the question of the possible existence of an intrinsic property of amiodarone which would explain the specificity of its activity on thyroid iodine organification and the development of amiodarone-induced human thyroid diseases.\r"

  ".U": "90353297\r", 
  ".W": "The permeability of intercellular spaces within the anterior pituitary (AP) and the influence of folliculo-stellate (FS) cells on compartmentalization within this tissue, has become a matter of debate. In reaggregated pituitary cell cultures as well as in the AP in situ the intercellular gaps and follicle-like structures remain accessible to molecular diffusion, whereas in some studies FS cells were reported to form tight epithelia that impede macromolecular transport through the spaces between the epithelial cells. In the present study the permeability of AP cell reaggregates was examined using fluorescent BSA as a tracer. Using confocal scanning laser microscopy a direct visualization of the permeation process was achieved. Quantitative estimation of the effective diffusion coefficient (Deff) for fluorescein-BSA within the aggregates was obtained using the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique. Deff was 1.33 +/- 0.31 x 10(-7) cm2/sec (mean +/- SD) in aggregates from 14-day-old female rats and 2.45 +/- 0.55 x 10(-7) cm2/sec in aggregates from adult female rats. These values are about three times lower than in free solution. Calculation of the time-dependent concentration distribution inside the aggregate for a Deff = 2 x 10(-7) cm2/sec revealed that the concentration of the fluorescent tracer in the center of the aggregate reaches 90% of the concentration outside the aggregate after 0.5 min for aggregates with a radius of 50 microns and 6 min for aggregates with a radius of 150 microns. Aggregates enriched in FS cells, in which we previously showed a sustained inhibition of secretory responses to stimulatory and inhibitory agents as compared to total population aggregates, showed a diffusion coefficient (Deff = 1.85 +/- 0.77 x 10(-7) cm2/sec) which was not significantly different from that in the total population aggregates. The present study shows that AP cell aggregates are fully permeable to diffusing molecules within minutes and that in a three-dimensional tissue configuration FS cells, which were reported to tonically inhibit AP hormone release in response to various secretagogues, do not impede molecular diffusion to an extent which would account for sustained inhibition of hormone release.\r"

These findings demonstrate that CRF acts via functional Leydig cell receptors to exert autocrine inhibitory actions on Leydig cell steroidogenesis. In the testis CRF acts as an antireproductive hormone and as a major local inhibitory regulator of Leydig cell function.\r"

These IFC respond immediately to bGH with maximal release of glycerol. Using a binding assay established for rat growth hormone (rGH) receptors, we measured the number of GH receptors in IFC from these rats. We demonstrate a 75% increase in GH receptors after preincubation with GH in normal rat IFC, and a 125% increase in GH receptors in diabetic IFC, without preincubation. These data support the concept that enhanced sensitivity to GH is an important feature of diabetes in rats and that this sensitivity is at least in part controlled by up-regulation of GH receptors.\r"

Standard techniques for analysis of IGF-I gene expression are not sufficiently sensitive for studies in early embryos. We have used the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to study IGF-I gene expression in whole chick embryos from the late blastula stage (E0 = laying) through the end of organogenesis (day 8), and in liver, brain and pancreas during mid-late embryogenesis and perinatally (hatching = day 21). Although at low levels in the blastoderm and gastrula, IGF-I mRNA was detectable in the whole embryo in all stages studied, with a tendency of the signal to increase with age during the first week of embryogenesis. In mid- and late embryogenesis, we easily detected IGF-I mRNA transcripts in pancreas and brain while the levels in the liver were barely detectable. Liver IGF-I mRNA increased markedly at the peak of postnatal growth (day 50). These studies suggest that while the major source of postnatal IGF-I may be the liver, extrahepatic tissues may be the predominant source of IGF-I during prenatal chicken development.\r"

  ".W": "Rat liver insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-I) mRNAs encoding the same IGF-I and precursor exist as two predominant size classes of 7.5-7.0 and 1.2-0.9 kilobases (kb). The different sized mRNAs, differ only in length of 3' untranslated sequence (3'UT) and appear to derive from the use of alternate polyadenylation sites. Since the long 3'UT of the 7.5-7.0 kb IGF-I mRNAs contain sequences implicated in mRNA destabilization, we compared decay of the 7.5-7.0 and 1.2-0.9 kb mRNAs, during in vitro incubation in a reticulocyte lysate cell-free translation system. The 7.5-7.0 kb mRNAs decayed to 30% of the initial abundance after 10 min in reticulocyte lysate and were undetectable after 60 min. In contrast, 80% of the 1.2-0.9 kb mRNAs remained after 60 min in reticulocyte lysate. The rapid decay of the large IGF-I mRNAs during incubation in reticulocyte lysate demonstrates that analysis of mRNA translation in cell-free systems must take into account the rate of mRNA decay. Induction and decay of the two rat liver IGF-I mRNAs was also analyzed in vivo in hypophysectomized rats given a single i.p. injection of human growth hormone (GH). While GH induced parallel increases in abundance of the two mRNAs, their decay rates differed. The time taken for decay to 50% maximum abundance was 4 h for the 7.5-7.0 kb mRNAs and 14 h for the 1.2-0.9 kb mRNAs. Differential in vitro and in vivo half-lives of liver IGF-I mRNAs that encode the same protein, derive from the same gene, and differ only in length of 3'UT indicates novel post-transcriptional mechanisms for control of liver IGF-I synthesis. Such mechanisms may have major significance in non-hepatic tissues such as brain where the 7.5-7.0 kb IGF-I mRNAs predominate. These findings with IGF-I mRNAs have general implications for products of other genes with multiple polyadenylation sites.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of dopamine (DA) on voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents were investigated in cultured rat lactotroph cells using the patch clamp recording technique. Each recorded cell was identified by the reverse hemolytic plaque assay. In the whole-cell configuration, two types of Ca2+ currents, L and T, were characterized on the basis of their kinetics, voltage sensitivity, and pharmacology. The L component had a threshold of -25 mV, showed little inactivation during a 150-msec voltage step, and was maximal at +10 mV. Cadmium ions (100 microM) significantly reduced its amplitude (75%). The T component was activated at a membrane potential close to -50 mV, was maximal at -10 mV, and showed a voltage-dependent inactivation between -90 and -30 mV. It was quickly inactivated during a maintained depolarization (time constant, 27 ms at -30 mV) and was strongly reduced (80%) by nickel ions (100 microM). Bath application of DA (10 nM) caused a markedly general depression of inward Ca2+ currents, acting differently on the T- and L-type currents. DA application shifted the voltage-dependence of the L-type current activation toward depolarization values (8 mV) without modifying its time- and voltage-dependent inactivation. In contrast, DA enhanced the inactivation of the T-type current by accelerating its time-dependent inactivation (25% decrease in the time constant of inactivation) and by shifting the voltage-dependence of the T-type current inactivation toward hyperpolarizing values (-63 mV in control vs. -77 mV in the presence of DA). These effects of DA were dose-dependent and involved the activation of a D2 receptor type. They were mimicked by bromocriptine application (10 nM), whereas sulpiride (100 nM) blocked the DA-evoked response. The D1 antagonist SCH 23390 was ineffective up to 100 microM. All of these DA-induced modifications in Ca2+ currents were abolished using a GTP-free pipette solution or after pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin, suggesting that DA can regulate the function of Ca2+ channels through GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Our results show that DA acts simultaneously by reducing both voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents on lactotroph cells. Thus, DA reduces the entry of Ca2+ ions across the surface membrane and thereby influences electrical activity and the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration involved in both basal and evoked PRL release.\r"

Gastric antral biopsy specimens from 1502 patients undergoing gastroduodenoscopy were studied and 892 (59%) were positive for H pylori. H pylori was strongly associated with gastritis: 873 of 1197 (73%) patients with gastritis were positive compared with 19 of 305 (6%) without gastritis (p less than 0.0001). The prevalences of H pylori and gastritis were similar in peptic ulcer patients of different races.

While our results do not help to explain the observed racial differences in peptic ulcer frequency it may be that the pathophysiology of non-ulcer dyspepsia is different in the different races in Singapore.\r"

Duodenal ulcer patients whose age of onset of symptoms was within the first three decades (n = 166) were more likely to be men (77%) and to have a positive family history of dyspepsia (45%) and a history of haemorrhage (46%) when compared with late onset patients (n = 197, men 57%, positive family history 23%, history of haemorrhage 36%). Early onset duodenal ulcer patients also secreted more gastric acid than late onset patients. In contrast, while early onset gastric ulcer patients were more likely to be men, when compared to late onset patients, the two groups were similar in their family history of dyspepsia, their history of haemorrhage, and their gastric acid output. The age of onset of Malay duodenal ulcer patients (mean (SD) 43.6 (16.0] was higher than those for Chinese patients (33.7 (16.1].\r"

The variables measured included polymorphonuclear and mononuclear cells per mm of superficial epithelium and per mm2 lamina propria. Duodenal ulcer crater margin and mucosal biopsy specimens from endoscopically inflamed mucosa in the group with duodenitis but no ulcer showed significantly higher inflammatory cell counts than endoscopically normal non-ulcer dyspepsia and control mucosa. Biopsy specimens from non-ulcer dyspepsia patients showed significantly higher lamina propria polymorphs than control group mucosa. Endoscopically normal duodenal ulcer and duodenitis but no ulcer mucosa also showed significantly higher acute and chronic inflammatory cell counts than controls. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal biopsy specimens was low (0-22%) and unrelated to local inflammatory response. Despite histological appearances, duodenal biopsy specimens from non-ulcer dyspepsia patients showed significantly higher inflammatory cell infiltration than control specimens, suggesting that at least some represent part of a spectrum of subclinical peptic disease.\r"

Normal subjects underwent standard pentagastrin (6 micrograms/kg) (n = 5) and sham feeding (n = 6) tests, with additional collection of urine samples before and two and three hours after the start of the test for measurement of titratable urine acidity. Nine subjects provided urine before and two hours after a test meal. Sham feeding (n = 5) and meal (n = 6) tests were carried out in patients who had had a successful vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. There was a significant correlation of gastric acid response in the standard tests with simultaneous changes in urine acidity (r = -0.79, p less than 0.001) and also with urine acid output after the test meal, on another day (r = -0.73; p less than 0.02). The correlation was insufficient to predict gastric function from changes in urinary acidity, but there was clear separation of the results in normal subjects and patients with vagotomy. Changes in urine acidity after a standardised meal may prove to be useful as a screening test after vagotomy to select patients who are likely to have a persisting high gastric acid response to vagal stimulants.\r"

Emetics and H2 antagonists or antacids were often used for batteries in the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum and laxatives were commonly prescribed for batteries in the small and large bowel. Of the 48.4% who felt batteries should be removed under certain circumstances, 78%, 72%, and 48% extracted them from the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum respectively within 24 hours of ingestion. The main reason for operative removal from the small and large bowel was failure of the battery to progress. Current management is therefore variable. Heavy metal poisoning may be occurring more frequently than is suggested in the published reports.\r"

We purified IgG from 15 patients with pernicious anaemia and 15 healthy controls in an effort to show attenuation of gastrin specific binding in vitro and inhibition of gastrin stimulated acid secretion in vivo. Binding of the IgG fraction was determined in a radioreceptor assay utilising the rat pancreatic carcinoma cell line AR42J which expresses high affinity gastrin binding sites (Kd = 5 x 10(-10)). In comparison with control serum, there was no significant displacement (p = 0.10) of human gastrin-17 binding by pernicious anemia samples at either 0.3 mg protein/ml (control (mean (SEM)) 1489 (131) cpm; patients 1858 (174) cpm) or 3 mg protein/ml (control 1930 (110); patients 2195 (107) cpm). The effect of intravenous and intragastric IgG on acid secretion in the anaesthetised rat was determined over a 60 minute period after stimulation with 1 microgram/kg human gastrin-17. A bolus injection of IgG (60-200 mg/kg) had no significant effect (p = 0.50) on gastrin stimulated acid output (29.21 (1.28) mumol H+/h) compared with control (27.48 (4.70) mumol H+/h). Similarly, instillation of 800 mg/kg IgG directly into the stomach for 90 minutes also failed to influence gastrin stimulated acid output (29.69 (3.22) mumol H+/h). Thus, we have been unable to confirm previous reports of an IgG from patients with pernicious anaemia capable of blocking gastrin receptor binding or gastrin stimulated acid secretion.\r"

To determine the physical factors involved in bowel occlusion, we created an experimental model using New Zealand rabbits in acute experiments under general anaesthesia. At operation a loop of small bowel was isolated and canulated, proximally for perfusion and pressure recording and distally to monitor flow. Having established the physiological pressure and flow conditions in a normal loop of gut, a stenosis was created using circular adjustable rings of determined widths. Pressure and flow were measured constantly and the variables studied were luminal diameter, stenosis length, and perfusate viscosity. This experimental model was reproduced using resected segments of human small bowel. We found a critical point- at 60% of the original diameter-down to which the small bowel is able to maintain normal flow. At a diameter smaller than this, the physiological parameters are rapidly altered up to the point of complete obstruction. In the rabbit model bowel rupture occurs at 30% of the initial size. Increased viscosity of the fluid and length of the stenosis alter this critical point inducing a larger critical diameter. We did not observe any cumulative effect of multiple identical stenoses.\r"

All had xylose and Schilling tests, distal duodenal biopsy, comprehensive barium studies, microbiological examination of six further stool samples, and repeat rectal histology. A microbiological or histological diagnosis of infection was made in 12 patients (multiple organisms in three). Cryptosporidia were identified on five occasions, cytomegalovirus on four, Giardia lamblia on two, and herpes simplex, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, and Entamoeba histolytica once each. No organism was found when weight loss was less than 5 kg or stool volume less than 400 ml/day (n = 9). Pathogens were identified in nine of 13 patients (69%) with weight loss greater than 10 kg and stool volume more than 800 ml/day. Barium studies were normal except for ileal flocculation in two patients with cryptosporidiosis. Evidence for malabsorption existed in 24 patients--impaired xylose absorption (n = 19) and abnormal Schilling test (n = 21). Of the patients with a severely abnormal Schilling test, a pathogen was identified in 11 (79%) (including all five with cryptosporidia, and two of the patients with only moderate diarrhoea and weight loss). A simple scoring system based on degree of weight loss and Schilling test result may help to identify the HIV positive patient with seemingly pathogen-negative diarrhoea in whom further investigations are likely to show a specific cause.\r"

Although patient numbers were small, a trend towards normalisation of rectal sensitivity was also observed in patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. No changes in rectal compliance or distension-induced motor activity occurred in either subgroup nor were any changes in somatic pain thresholds observed. The results suggest that symptomatic improvement in irritable bowel syndrome after hypnotherapy may in part be due to changes in visceral sensitivity.\r"

  ".W": "Sn(tin4+)-protoporphyrin, a potent competitive inhibitor of haeme oxygenase, the rate limiting enzyme in the degradation of haeme to bile pigments, was given intravenously to six patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and to four patients with idiopathic haemochromatosis. Serum bilirubin concentrations decreased in all patients after administration of 1-2 mumol/kg body weight of the metalloporphyrin, given in two doses eight to 24 hours apart. This reduction lasted approximately four to five days after injection of the compound. Excretion of endogenous haeme in bile increased (mean increase approximately two to threefold) in parallel with the decrease in serum bilirubin concentrations in both patient groups, and the highest biliary haeme concentrations were found during the first 48 hours after treatment. Sn-protoporphyrin was cleared rapidly from plasma with a half-life of 3.4 hours. Biliary bilirubin concentrations decreased (mean decrease, 49%) in the haemochromatosis patients after Sn-protoporphyrin administration. No decrease in biliary bilirubin concentrations could be detected in the primary biliary cirrhosis patients under the same conditions. Thus, Sn-protoporphyrin treatment resulted in a decrease in serum bilirubin concentrations and an increase in biliary haeme excretion in patients with haemochromatosis and primary biliary cirrhosis, as has previously been shown in normal subjects. The results indicate that the synthetic haeme analogue inhibits haeme oxidation activity in the two patient groups studied, as it does in normal people and in experimental animals. The lack of effect of Sn-protoporphyrin on biliary bilirubin excretion in primary biliary cirrhosis may be related to a differently affected hepatic clearance system or to a different distribution of tissue bilirubin pools in this condition.\r"

These endoprostheses, however, tend to clog with time. We investigated this problem by undertaking in vitro studies on stents of different designs made of different polymer materials. The stent that performed best was then tested in an in vivo trial. There was a direct relation in vitro between the frictional coefficient of a polymer and the amount of encrusted material. Catheters perfused in bacterially contaminated bile, irrespective of material and design, accrued significantly more sludge than catheters perfused with sterilised bile. The presence of side holes significantly increased the amount of sludge in the stents, but eliminated any differences between the various materials. We therefore investigated the effect of omitting side holes in a clinical trial which consisted of two groups of 20 patients each. The group treated with conventional stents accrued significantly more sludge in the stents than the group treated with experimental stents without side holes (p less than 0.05). The absence of side holes did not cause incomplete drainage or increase morbidity. Side holes are detrimental to stent patency, which is adversely affected by other factors including bacteria and proteins.\r"

There is no effective treatment or method of preventing cholestasis in cystic fibrosis, although beneficial effects have been ascribed to the tertiary bile acid, ursodeoxycholate, in other forms of chronic cholestasis. We evaluated prospectively the effects of a six month course of ursodeoxycholate (15-20 mg/kg per day) in eight, mostly adult, patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic cholestasis. Bile acid treatment improved inflammatory activity (average decrease in alanine aminotransferase, 60%, p less than 0.005) and cholestasis (alkaline phosphatase, 47%; p less than 0.01) in all patients. Quantitative liver function, measured by 45 minute sulphobromophthalein retention and by the 14C-aminopyrine breath test, improved in all patients while galactose elimination capacity showed a slight decrease. Patients' nutritional state improved as evidenced by a 1.8 kg weight gain and an increase in muscle mass suggested by a 26% increase in 24 hour urinary creatinine excretion. Steatorrhea was not affected by bile acid treatment. Ursodeoxycholic acid may be beneficial in the treatment of chronic cholestasis in cystic fibrosis by improving liver function and also the patient's nutritional state.\r"

To prevent bile leakage or haemorrhage from the incision channel, a tissue adhesive was injected into the channel or ceruletid was administered subcutaneously before removing the catheter to induce contraction of the gall bladder. Thus we were able to treat 44 patients without any complications. Nausea and vomiting could be reduced if the treatment time was kept short and the perfusion volume was as low as possible.

  ".W": "The effect of peritoneal lavage with the addition of camostate to the lavage fluid on the outcome of taurocholate pancreatitis in rats was studied. Camostate is a low molecular weight protease inhibitor which has been developed recently. Peritoneal lavage was performed for 12 hours and camostate was added to the lavage fluid in five concentrations. At 0.1 mg/ml the survival rate increased significantly (11 of 20 v controls 4 of 20, p less than 0.05); the maximal effect was observed at 0.2 mg/ml, and no effect was seen at 0.01 and 0.05 mg/ml. Adverse effects occurred at 0.5 mg/ml. The addition of 0.1 mg/ml camostate significantly reduced the acidosis in arterial blood: mean (SD) pH 7.30 (0.035) v controls 7.23 (0.054) (n = 9, p less than 0.01) and arterial base excess: -15.4 (1.26) mmol/l v controls: -17.4 (2.51) mmol/l (n = 9, p less than 0.05). There was no difference, however, in plasma amylase activity and in the histological degree of specific tissue damage to the pancreas. A combination of intravenous camostate and lavage with the addition of camostate to the lavage fluid yielded a significantly improved survival compared with treatment with intravenous camostate alone (10 out of 16 animals v intravenous camostate alone, two out of 16, p greater than 0.01). We conclude that lavage with camostate significantly improves the prognosis of severe necrotising pancreatitis in rats.\r"

The fasting concentrations of all amino acids were reduced. The clearances of alanine, arginine, glycine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, proline, serine, threonine, and tyrosine were increased. The urea synthesis rate during amino acid infusion was 27 mumols/kg per minute (normal range 20-24 mumols/kg per minute). The lean body mass of the patients was reduced to 59% of the expected value. It is suggested that the weight loss of patients with glucagonoma syndrome is partly due to increased hepatic conversion of amino acid nitrogen to urea nitrogen, resulting in decreased blood amino acid concentration, and secondary to this, organ protein catabolism, as shown by the decreased lean body mass.\r"

Coronary angioplasty of multiple vessels was performed in 105 patients 0 to 15 days (mean 5 +/- 4) after recent myocardial infarction. There were 77 men (73%) and 28 women (27%), with a mean age of 57 years. All patients had severe multivessel disease, 68% with two vessel and 32% with three vessel disease. Twenty-eight patients (27%) had successful thrombolysis before angioplasty and 70 (67%) had postinfarction angina. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 58 +/- 10% and was less than 45% in 13 patients (12%). Angioplasty was attempted in 319 lesions (mean 3 lesions per patient, range 2 to 9) and 252 vessels (mean 2.4 vessels per patient, range 2 to 4), with success in 302 lesions (95%) and 237 vessels (94%); angioplasty was done in two stages in 59 patients (56%). Clinical success was achieved in 102 patients (97%). Complications included myocardial infarction in six patients (5.7%) (one Q wave, five non-Q wave), urgent bypass surgery in two (1.9%) and death in one (0.9%); overall, seven patients (7%) had a major complication. All patients had a follow-up duration greater than 1 year (mean 31 months, range 12 to 73). Clinical recurrence developed in 24 patients (23%), of whom 21 had repeat angioplasty, 1 had bypass surgery and 2 were managed medically. Ten patients (9.8%) had a late infarction and 5 (4.9%) died of cardiac death during the follow-up period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90354558\r", 
  ".W": "The relative influences of revascularization status and baseline characteristics on long-term outcome were examined in 867 patients with multivessel coronary disease who had undergone successful coronary angioplasty. These patients represented 83% of a total of 1,039 patients in whom angioplasty had been attempted with an in-hospital mortality and infarction rate of 2.5% and 4.8%, respectively. Emergency coronary bypass surgery was needed in 4.9%. Of the 867 patients, 41% (group 1) were considered to have complete revascularization and 59% (group 2) to have incomplete revascularization. Univariate analysis revealed major differences between these two groups with patients in group 2 characterized by advanced age, more severe angina, a greater likelihood of previous coronary surgery and infarction, more extensive disease and poorer left ventricular function. Over a mean follow-up period of 26 months, the probability of event-free survival was significantly lower for group 2 only with respect to the need for coronary artery surgery (p = 0.004) and occurrence of severe angina (p = 0.04). The difference in mortality was of borderline significance (p = 0.051) and there were no significant differences between groups 1 and 2 in either the incidence of myocardial infarction or the need for repeat angioplasty. Multivariate analysis identified independent baseline predictors of late cardiac events that were then used to adjust the probabilities of event-free survival. This adjustment effectively removed any significant influence of completeness of revascularization on event-free survival for any of the above end points including the combination of death, myocardial infarction and need for coronary artery surgery. Therefore, late outcome in these patients is not significantly influenced by revascularization status but depends more on baseline patient characteristics.\r"

  ".U": "90354560\r", 
  ".W": "There are few in vivo data concerning the mechanisms of balloon inflation during coronary angioplasty. To characterize how lesions dilate, videodensitometry was used to measure the diameter of the inflated balloon across 29 coronary lesions in 27 patients. Pressure-diameter curves for each lesion were derived with use of a standardized incremental inflation protocol in which pressures between 2 and 6 atm in 3 mm low profile balloons approximated normal vessel diameter. The diameter of coronary stenosis before and after angioplasty was also measured. Pressure-diameter curves showed that the most improvement in luminal caliber occurred at low inflation pressure. A distensibility factor was defined as the ratio of the amount of balloon inflation at 2 atm compared with the balloon diameter at 6 atm. Eccentric irregular lesions (n = 11) had a greater distensibility factor (0.49 +/- 0.17) than did lesions (n = 18) without this configuration (0.33 +/- 0.14) (p less than 0.02). The former were soft, presumably because of thrombus in these lesions. In addition, there were no differences in patterns of balloon inflation for lesions requiring additional inflation or for dilations resulting in an intimal crack or dissection after angioplasty. There was often a loss of luminal caliber when balloon diameter at 6 atm was compared with the diameter after angioplasty. This was defined as elasticity or recoil. There was a significant direct correlation between the amount of elasticity and the extent of balloon inflation at 6 atm (that is, lesions more fully dilated at 6 atm showed more elasticity).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One third to one half of such patients demonstrate abnormalities of myocardial perfusion or metabolism when evaluated with invasive techniques. This study was designed to determine whether angina in such patients is attributable to abnormalities of perfusion at rest, maximal perfusion or vasodilator reserve and whether any identified abnormalities were global or regional in nature. Positron emission tomography was performed with oxygen-15-labeled water (H2(15)O) and oxygen-15-labeled carbon monoxide (C15O) before and after intravenous dipyridamole to assess regional myocardial perfusion and perfusion reserve in absolute terms in 16 normal subjects and 17 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries. Eight of the 17 patients had a myocardial perfusion reserve less than 2.5 (the lower limit of normal in studies with positron emission tomography, as well as with other techniques) and 9 of 17 patients had a normal response. In the patients with an impaired perfusion reserve, perfusion at rest was significantly higher than that measured in normal subjects (1.61 +/- 0.38 versus 1.25 +/- 0.28 ml/g per min, p less than 0.02) and maximal flow and perfusion reserve were significantly reduced (2.26 +/- 0.92 versus 4.62 +/- 1.58 ml/g per min and 1.4 +/- 0.5 versus 3.8 +/- 1.1, respectively; p less than 0.001 for both comparisons). Abnormalities of perfusion and perfusion reserve were spatially homogeneous without detectable regional disparities. Thus, nearly half of patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries have abnormalities of myocardial perfusion that are detectable noninvasively with positron emission tomography and H2(15)O.\r"

Right bundle branch block occurred in 86 (85%), left bundle branch block in 5 (4%) and nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect in 9 (11%). One hundred of these 111 patients were successfully matched with others in the study population who had maintained normal intraventricular conduction during the operative period. Patients were matched on the basis of age, gender, absence of preoperative conduction disturbances, left ventricular function and bypass grafts to the same vessels. Follow-up of the two groups for a period of 1 to 76 months (mean 60 months) failed to show any difference in survival or cardiac events such as myocardial infarction, repeat coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty and permanent pacemaker implantation. The appearance of right or left bundle branch block or a nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect after coronary bypass surgery does not appear to have an unfavorable impact on the long-term prognosis of these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of exercise on right ventricular diastolic function were evaluated in 14 patients who underwent supine rest and exercise right ventricular angiography. On the basis of coronary anatomy and exercise left ventricular regional wall motion analysis, these patients were classified into two groups: Group 1 (n = 7) had no or only mild coronary artery disease and Group 2 (n = 7) had significant coronary disease and exercise-induced left ventricular wall motion abnormalities suggesting ischemia. Chamber stiffness at rest was higher in Group 2 (48 x 10(-3) ml-1/m2) than in Group 1 (18 x 10(-3) ml-1/m2, p = 0.006). During exercise, right ventricular filling rate in the second half of diastole was significantly lower in Group 2 (126 versus 276 ml/m2 per s, p less than 0.03). The time constant of right ventricular pressure decay decreased significantly in both groups with exercise; however, both groups displayed a parallel upward shift of the pressure-volume curve with exercise. Because ischemia could not be demonstrated in Group 1, it is an unlikely explanation for this shift. Septal shifting was not a significant factor with exercise. Because of an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume with exercise and a close correlation between right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures (r = 0.96 for Group 1 and r = 0.76 for Group 2), pericardial constraint is the most likely cause for this upward shift of the pressure-volume curve. Therefore, an increase in right ventricular end-diastolic pressure may not be a reliable indicator of ischemia during exercise because this pressure is coupled to changes in left ventricular volume and pericardial constraint.\r"

The mean patient age at the time of operation was 77.4 +/- 7.0 years; 93% had moderate to severe preoperative symptomatic limitation. Compared with preoperative studies, Doppler echocardiographic evaluation before hospital discharge revealed a significant reduction in the mean aortic valve pressure gradient (45.3 +/- 16.2 to 14.4 +/- 6.5 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001) and improvement in aortic valve area (0.62 +/- 0.17 to 1.33 +/- 0.33 cm2, p less than 0.0001). There was no initial change in aortic regurgitation grade. Follow-up Doppler echocardiographic evaluation was possible in 43 patients alive at 9.3 +/- 3.9 months. A small but statistically significant trend toward aortic restenosis was found; only one patient had severe restenosis. Severe aortic regurgitation had developed in 26% of patients and moderate aortic regurgitation in 37%. Aortic valve replacement was performed in six patients (14%) with severe symptomatic aortic regurgitation. Significant deficiency in central coaptation as a result of cusp scarification and retraction appeared to be the mechanism of postdecalcification regurgitation. Attempted salvage of the native aortic valve in severe calcific stenosis by ultrasonic decalcification adequately relieves stenosis but leads to an unacceptable incidence of significant aortic regurgitation at follow-up study.\r"

Accordingly, this study examined the validity and relative usefulness of the Doppler valve gradient and area measurements in 31 patients (mean age 69 +/- 10 years) 20 +/- 4 months after implantation of a given type of aortic bioprosthesis ranging in size from 19 to 29 mm. Valve area data obtained with both the standard and simplified continuity equations were compared with known in vitro prosthetic valve area measurements and an excellent correlation was obtained between the standard and simplified continuity equations (r = 0.98, SEE +/- 0.07 cm2, p less than 0.0005) and between in vivo and known in vitro prosthetic valve areas (r = 0.86, SEE +/- 0.16 cm2, p less than 0.0005). Peak gradient ranged from 10.8 to 75.0 mm Hg (mean 35 +/- 16) and mean gradient from 7.6 to 43.7 mm Hg (mean 20.5 +/- 9.5). The correlations between prosthetic valve gradient and in vivo area were r = -0.53, SEE +/- 14 mm Hg and r = -0.49, SEE +/- 8.63 mm Hg for peak and mean gradient, respectively. These relations were improved by indexing valve area by body surface area. The best correlations were obtained between indexed valve area and a quadratic function of the gradient (r = -0.72, SEE +/- 11.72 mm Hg and r = -0.70, SEE +/- 7.28 mm Hg for peak and mean gradient, respectively), reflecting a curvilinear relation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular filling (as assessed by Doppler echocardiography) has previously been shown to depend in a complex fashion on ventricular diastolic function (compliance and relaxation) as well as other variables, such as atrial pressure and compliance, ventricular systolic function and mitral valve impedance. To study the effect of isolated physiologic alterations on individual Doppler indexes, a mathematic model of mitral flow was analyzed. By varying one physiologic variable at a time, it was shown that mitral velocity acceleration is affected directly by atrial pressure and inversely by the ventricular relaxation time constant, with relatively little impact of chamber compliance. Deceleration rate was directly influenced by mitral valve area, atrial pressure and ventricular systolic dysfunction and inversely affected by atrial and ventricular compliance relations, with little impact of relaxation unless it was so delayed as to be incomplete during deceleration. Peak velocity was directly affected most strongly by initial left atrial pressure, and lowered somewhat by prolonged relaxation, low atrial and ventricular compliance and systolic dysfunction. Strikingly different filling patterns emerged when the primary physiologic alterations were accompanied by simultaneous compensatory changes in atrial pressure designed to maintain stroke volume constant. Low ventricular compliance with preload compensation produced characteristic E waves with very short acceleration and deceleration times and high peak velocity. Thus, mathematic analysis of ventricular filling helps to explain the physical and physiologic basis for the transmitral velocity curve.\r"

Patients were categorized according to the rhythm induced at baseline drug-free electrophysiologic testing. Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 39 patients (16%) (Group 1), sustained ventricular tachycardia in 66 patients (27%) (Group 2) and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in 34 patients (14%) (Group 3); 102 patients (42%) (Group 4) did not have an arrhythmia inducible at baseline electrophysiologic testing.

At a mean follow-up time of 30 +/- 15 months, recurrent sudden cardiac death or nonfatal ventricular fibrillation occurred in 11 (28%) of 39 patients with inducible ventricular fibrillation (Group 1), 14 (21%) of 66 patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group 2), 4 (12%) of 34 patients with inducible nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (Group 3) and 16 (16%) of 102 patients without inducible arrhythmias (Group 4). Actuarial analysis revealed a 2 year cumulative arrhythmia-free survival rate of 65% for patients in Group 2, 71% for patients in Group 1, 79% for patients in Group 3 and 81% for patients in Group 4 (p = 0.02). Actuarial survival of patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation suppressed by electrophysiologically guided drug therapy was not significantly different from that in patients whose arrhythmia was not suppressed. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that only the presence of congestive heart failure was an independent predictor of outcome in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventeen percent of patients receiving an AICD at The Johns Hopkins Hospital also had a permanent pacemaker implanted before (16 patients), at the same time as (2 patients) or after (12 patients) AICD implantation. Four types of interactions were noted: 1) transient failure to sense or capture immediately after AICD discharge (seven patients); 2) oversensing of the pacemaker stimulus by the AICD, leading to double counting (one patient); 3) AICD failure to sense ventricular fibrillation resulting from pacemaker stimulus oversensing (three patients, one only at high asynchronous output); and 4) pacemaker reprogramming caused by AICD discharge (three patients). No clinical sequelae of these interactions were noted during follow-up study. Thus, potentially adverse clinical interactions are common and routine screening is recommended. With proper attention to lead placements and programming of the devices, clinical consequences of these interactions can be avoided.\r"

Among the 19 patients with symptoms, the initial symptom was syncope in 13 (69%), aborted sudden death in 5 (26%) and near drowning in 1 (5%). There were three deaths during a combined follow-up period of 67 patient-years (average annual mortality rate 4.5%). Patients who did not respond to therapy with a beta-adrenergic blocker and those who died were significantly younger than the remaining patients at the time of diagnosis (p less than or equal to 0.05 for both). Analysis of 44 treadmill exercise tests performed by 16 patients revealed significant prolongation of the median corrected QT (QTc) interval in response to exercise, with maximal prolongation present after 2 min of recovery (median QTc interval 0.52 s versus a baseline value of 0.47 s, p less than 0.001). Characteristic changes in T wave configuration were noted in 8 of 15 patients on at least one occasion during ambulatory Holter electrocardiographic monitoring, including T wave alternation in two patients, both of whom died shortly afterward. It is suggested that the congenital long QT syndrome is associated with a significant mortality rate in childhood despite the use of conventional therapy in symptomatic patients. Ambulatory Holter monitoring and treadmill exercise testing may be helpful, both in confirming the diagnosis of a long QT syndrome and in monitoring the adequacy of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Medical treatment was pursued up to the use of amiodarone with a type Ib or Ic antiarrhythmic drug unless the patient became hemodynamically unstable. Patients underwent surgery when these drug regimens failed or when moderate congestive heart failure was present. Seven patients were successfully treated medically and seven underwent surgical treatment. Of those treated surgically, five had cryothermic lesions and two had excisions. Five of the surgically treated patients required temporary additional medical treatment. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 53 months (mean 28). Eleven of the 14 patients are currently not taking any antiarrhythmic medication. No patient required a pacemaker, none received anticongestive medications and none died.\r"

  ".W": "Previous methods used to assess atrial baffle function after correction of transposition of the great arteries have included precordial echocardiography and cardiac catheterization. To evaluate whether single plane transesophageal echocardiography might provide additional information, its findings were correlated with information derived from both precordial echocardiography and cardiac catheterization in 15 patients (14 Mustard procedures, 1 Senning procedure) aged 4.2 to 33 years (mean 16.3). Precordial ultrasound with combined imaging, color flow mapping and pulsed Doppler ultrasound visualized the supramitral portion of the common systemic venous atrium in every case but could identify only superior limb obstruction in three of six patients, mid-baffle obstruction in zero of two and inferior limb obstruction in zero of two patients. Transesophageal studies with use of the same range of ultrasound methods demonstrated superior limb obstruction (severe in four, mild in two) in six of six patients, mid-baffle obstruction in two of two and inferior limb obstruction in two of two patients. The entire pulmonary venous atrium was equally well interrogated by either ultrasound approach, with both identifying three cases (two mild, one moderate) of mid-pulmonary venous atrium obstruction. However, individual pulmonary vein velocity profiles could only be recorded by transesophageal pulsed Doppler ultrasound. Precordial studies identified baffle leaks (1 large, 2 small) in only three patients, whereas transesophageal studies identified 11 such baffle leaks (1 large, 10 small), which were multiple in two patients. It is concluded that transesophageal echocardiography provides a more detailed and accurate assessment of atrial baffle morphology and function than is provided by either precordial ultrasound or cardiac catheterization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "During reperfusion of a myocardial infarct, development of microvascular occlusion may result in regional hypoperfusion (\"no reflow\") despite a patent infarct-related artery. This study examined the extent and time course of no reflow with use of rubidium-82 positron emission tomography. In 12 anesthetized dogs, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 90 min and then freely reperfused. Regional myocardial perfusion was imaged by serial rubidium-82 positron emission tomography during coronary occlusion and every 30 min during reperfusion. After 4 h of reperfusion, infarct size and no reflow zone were measured postmortem by triphenyltetrazolium and thioflavin staining, respectively. Perfusion defects evident on rubidium-82 images during coronary occlusion rapidly resolved during the early reflow period. However, a recurrent perfusion defect appeared after 1 to 2 h of reflow in all dogs. The severity of recurrent perfusion defects progressed with time; after 5 min of reflow, relative perfusion in the left anterior descending artery territory was 97 +/- 6% of that in the normal circumflex artery region, but perfusion decreased progressively to 68 +/- 5% after 2 h (p less than 0.05) and to 55 +/- 4% after 4 h of reperfusion (p less than 0.05 versus 2 h). As measured by radioactive tracer microspheres, endocardial blood flow decreased similarly in the postischemic left anterior descending artery region from 1.2 +/- 0.2 ml/min per g after 5 min of reflow to 0.4 +/- 0.1 ml/min per g after 3 h of reflow (p less than 0.01). Residual infarct perfusion, measured by rubidium-82 after 4 h of reflow, was related to both infarct size (r = -0.88) and the extent of the no reflow zone (r = -0.84) in the postmortem left ventricular sections. Thus, serial positron emission tomography with rubidium-82 demonstrates a progressive loss of infarct perfusion, beginning 1 to 2 h after initial restoration of blood flow despite patency of the infarct-related artery. This phenomenon is probably a manifestation of progressive microvascular occlusion within the reperfused myocardium.\r"

  ".U": "90354582\r", 
  ".W": "Pressure-volume relation analysis was used to independently quantify changes in ventricular contractile performance and vascular loading in intact anesthetized dogs before and after a single bolus of intravenous amrinone. Ventricular systolic property changes were characterized by the end-systolic elastance (Ees = slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation) and arterial properties by the effective arterial elastance (Ea = end-systolic pressure/stroke volume ratio). Pressure-volume data were obtained by the conductance catheter technique with loading varied by transient inferior vena cava occlusion. Amrinone induced a 27% increase in ejection fraction at 10 min (from 44% to 56%) as a result of both a significant rise in contractility (mean Ees 4 +/- 2 to 6 +/- 3 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.001) and simultaneous reduction in arterial loading (Ea reduction from 6 +/- 2 mm Hg/ml to 5 mm Hg/ml, p less than 0.001). Over the subsequent 30 min, Ea revealed a significant recovery toward baseline, whereas Ees was less altered. Mean percent changes (% delta) in both variables were linearly correlated: % delta Ea = -1.6 x % delta Ees + 3.1, r = 0.96, p less than 0.001. In addition to separating ventricular from vascular property changes, the pressure-volume coupling framework was used to predict net pump performance (ejection fraction). Model predictions showed good agreement with experimental data. Thus, pressure-volume relations can be used to separately quantitate simultaneous changes in ventricular and vascular loading properties in vivo produced by pharmacologic agents with complex actions. Use of this approach in drug testing in humans should simplify data interpretation regarding mechanisms of action in specific clinical settings.\r"

  ".W": "Seven of 17 patients with incessant supraventricular tachycardia caused by an accessory pathway with a long retrograde conduction time were seen with symptoms or echocardiographic signs of a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Three patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II with dyspnea and four were in class III. Eight patients (six with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy) underwent surgery because of failure of medical treatment (including one patient in functional class I) and one underwent direct current catheter ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) node. In six patients echocardiograms recorded before and after the procedure were available. Before surgery or direct current ablation the mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 36.3 +/- 8.7%, the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 55.7 +/- 7.6 mm and the left ventricular end-systolic diameter 44.3 +/- 7.8 mm. A mean of 21.6 +/- 6.8 months after the procedure the mean left ventricular ejection fraction increased to 58.6 +/- 8.0%, the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased to 49.0 +/- 3.6 mm and the left ventricular end-systolic diameter decreased to 32.2 +/- 2.7 mm; all six patients were in functional class I. These results confirm that control of incessant tachycardia leads to a regression of symptoms and signs of cardiomyopathy and progressive normalization of the dimensions of the heart. Because of these findings, surgery should be considered early in patients with an accessory AV pathway and incessant tachycardia. The presence of a tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy should therefore be an indication for surgery rather than a contraindication.\r"

Pace mapping and catheter activation mapping of the spontaneous and isoproterenol-induced ventricular tachycardia located the tachycardia origin in the right ventricular outflow tract. Ablation dramatically reduced spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and ectopic activity (from 50,000 to less than 100 ectopic beats/24 h). The patient has remained symptom free and without ventricular tachycardia recurrence for 3 years. These observations and review of previous studies suggest that catheter mapping can easily locate the arrhythmia focus in the right ventricular outflow tract and that catheter ablation can be performed at low risk. Catheter ablation is a viable option for the treatment of right ventricular catecholamine-sensitive tachycardias that are unresponsive to antiarrhythmic drugs.\r"

In men and women, strenuous exercisers had significantly (P less than .01) higher age-adjusted high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels than nonstrenuous exercisers, and male strenuous exercisers also had lower plasma triglyceride levels. Adjusting for differences in cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, or obesity did not alter these results. A subgroup of 498 consecutive men and 615 consecutive women that completed a more detailed exercise questionnaire were classified into categories of light, moderate, heavy, or no exercise. In men, age-adjusted HDL cholesterol levels were higher and triglyceride levels lower with higher exercise-intensity categories (P for trend less than .001). In the heavy exercise category, HDL cholesterol levels were 15% higher and plasma triglyceride levels were 41% lower than in the sedentary group. In women, HDL cholesterol levels were significantly higher and triglyceride levels lower at the more moderate levels of exercise. In both genders results among exercise-intensity groups did not change after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. In men, adjusting for obesity did not significantly alter the intergroup differences, whereas in women adjusting for body mass index or waist-to-hip ratio reduced differences in HDL cholesterol levels between exercising and sedentary participants to nonsignificance. We conclude that exercise levels attainable by older adults may significantly improve HDL cholesterol levels and could theoretically reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease.\r"

  ".W": "Standard functional assessment instruments often fail to capture subtle impairment in community-dwelling older persons. To create a scale to measure function at the Advanced Activities of Daily Living (AADL) level, we chose three questions to separate a community sample into four levels: frequent vigorous exercisers (8.0%), frequent long walkers (10.8%), frequent short walkers (23.7%), and nonexercisers (57.5%). These levels of exercise formed a hierarchical scale that correlated positively in a graduated manner with progressively advanced social activities of daily living, current health status, and mental health. At 1-year follow-up, 20% of persons declined in exercise level, 63% showed no change in exercise level, and 17% improved their exercise level. Changes in exercise level in both directions were associated with changes in mental health status. The Advanced Activities of Daily Living scale may be a sensitive measure of earlier functional decline, but longer follow-up will be necessary to determine its clinical usefulness.\r"

The members of both groups were randomly assigned into trial and control groups. Serum Ca, creatinine, and calcidiol levels were measured before and after the trial. The regimen consisted of 1.558 g of Ca and 45 micrograms (equal to 1,800 IU) of vitamin D administered daily in addition to the normal diet. The controls received no treatment. A majority of the elderly subjects living independently had ensured their Ca, and a quarter of them also their vitamin D intake on their own initiative. The mean serum calcidiol concentration before the trial was 24.1 nmol/L in the institutionalized and 38.5 nmol/L in the elderly subjects living independently (P less than .001). After the trial, serum calcidiol was 10.4 nmol/L in the institutionalized control subjects and had decreased (P less than .001) in both control groups, but increased (P less _han .001) in both treatment groups. The safety indicators, serum Ca, creatinine, and calcidiol, did not indicate any group or individual side effect.\r"

A high incidence of postoperative complication, revision, and mortality with poor quality of life confirm the serious prognosis of these individuals. Regression analyses indicated that peripheral vascular disease and prolonged preoperative hospitalization were associated with complications. Preoperative gangrene and peripheral vascular disease were associated with the need for revision. Complications, a low body mass index, and multiple diseases were related to death. Those with multiple diseases and extensive atherosclerosis were less likely to walk. Ability to perform activities of daily living was the most important predictor of quality of life. Patients at higher risk for these adverse outcomes need to be identified early in their hospital stay. The involvement of the patient or his or her surrogate in decisions regarding the course of treatment and the level of amputation is essential.\r"

  ".W": "Serum concentrations of parathyroid hormone are frequently increased in elderly subjects. How much this increase may contribute to the development of osteoporosis in such subjects is unknown. Long-standing hypoparathyroidism has been reported to be accompanied by an increase in skeletal density. In seven consecutive women, aged 40 to 83 years, with hypoparathyroidism of at least 18 years duration, the mineral density in the lumbar vertebrae was measured by quantitative computed tomography (QCT) and dual photon absorptiometry (DPA). In these subjects, the bone mineral density by dual photon absorptiometry was 1.4 to 6.2 standard deviations above mean values for age-matched normal women. However, the mineral density of vertebral trabecular bone as determined by quantitative computed tomography was only slightly increased above values reported for normal women. The differences between the values determined by dual photon absorptiometry and quantitative computed tomography indicate that most of the increase in mineral density was a reflection of increased cortical bone. Roentgenograms of the metacarpals did not reveal consistent differences between normals and the hypoparathyroid subjects. These findings suggest the possibility that control of parathyroid function might be of value in treating osteoporotic patients.\r"

Eleven patients were considered to be at high risk for surgery due to chronic cardiorespiratory or renal problems. The outcome of these patients was compared with that of 20 consecutive elderly patients with gallstone pancreatitis treated at the same time by means other than endoscopic sphincterotomy. Endoscopic sphincterotomy resulted in an immediate clinical improvement in all patients, except in one patient who developed transient cholangitis; there was no mortality. In contrast, there was one death (5%) and 20% morbidity in the controls. Mean hospitalization period was shorter in patients undergoing sphincterotomy (6 compared with 9.5 days), although the patients managed by sphincterotomy were initially more seriously ill than controls. Only two of the 11 high-risk patients underwent elective cholecystectomy; all others were well during a mean follow-up of 22 months. It is concluded that early endoscopic sphincterotomy is highly effective and safe in acute attacks of gallstone pancreatitis in elderly high-risk patients.\r"

Discharge records and laboratory rotavirus detection for 1979-1989 at the Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, were evaluated to determine the impact of rotavirus gastroenteritis at a large children's hospital. The availability since 1983 of diagnostic assays less expensive than electron microscopy was associated with increased rotavirus detection. Only 67% of rotavirus-positive samples came from children likely to have had community-acquired acute gastroenteritis. Combined laboratory results and ICD-9 discharge diagnosis codes (008.6, 008.8, and 558.9) measured rotavirus activity better than either alone. A case definition for hospitalization for rotavirus infection resulted in an estimate that an average of 473 children were hospitalized for rotavirus infection at Texas Children's Hospital each year over the 10-year period. These cases accounted for 3.0% of all hospital days and $1.5 million per year in bed costs at this hospital. Hospitalization rates and the impact of hospital costs for the USA were estimated by extrapolation.\r"

IgG1 and 3 were the dominant subclasses among patients with primary and recurrent infections; IgG1 was also prevalent in the CSF samples. The VZV IgG subclass distribution patterns did not allow differentiation between primary and recurrent infections. However, seroconversions for IgG2, 3, or 4 were observed among patients with recurrences who were negative for specific IgM, suggesting that qualitative tests for serum IgG subclass antibody could be helpful for diagnosis in such cases. Herpes simplex virus-specific IgG was found in CSF samples from several patients with meningitis.

HHV-6 most closely resembled cytomegalovirus in that it was relatively resistant to the antiviral effects of acyclovir and bromovinyl-deoxyuridine but sensitive to ganciclovir and phosphonoacetic acid. From these results, it appears more likely that HHV-6 infections would respond to ganciclovir and foscarnet than to acyclovir should treatment be deemed advisable, although the low toxicity of acyclovir may allow for its use at doses that might affect replication of HHV-6.\r"

Lymphoblastoid cell lines were established from 26 HIV-positive subjects and analyzed for the presence of A- or B-type EBV by Southern analysis and immunoblotting. Some 19% of HIV-positive persons were infected with B-type EBV, 69% with A-type, and 12% with both types. Analysis of the individual strains of EBV harbored by the HIV-positive subjects showed that HIV-induced immunosuppression had not led to increased susceptibility to repeated EBV infections. However, the occurrence of B-type infection in HIV-positive subjects was sixfold higher than that in the general community, indicating that HIV-induced immunodeficiency or HIV itself specifically enhanced the expression of the B-type EBV.\r"

  ".W": "A serologic survey for human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection was conducted on nearly half of the entire 260-member Hagahai population, a hunter-horticulturist group occupying the northern banks of the Yuat River Gorge in Madang Province of Papua New Guinea. For comparison, sera from two neighboring groups, the Pinai and Haruai, were tested. As determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and verified by Western immunoblot, IgG antibodies against HTLV-I were detected in 17 of 120 Hagahai, giving an HTLV-I seroprevalence of 14%, which is as high as that found in HTLV-I-endemic regions such as southwestern Japan and the Caribbean basin. Infection tended to cluster in family groups and was more common with increasing age. The majority of ELISA-positive (45/61) Hagahai sera were indeterminate, with 62% (28/45) exhibiting reactivity to three or more gag-encoded proteins. The clinical significance of the high frequency of indeterminate HTLV-I Western immunoblots is unknown, but it is not unlike that encountered in other Melanesian populations. Whether this reflects incomplete specific reactivity to HTLV-I or the existence of HTLV-I-related retroviruses in Papua New Guinea is being investigated.\r"

Between 15 June and 3 July, 93% of case-patients ate at a specific restaurant compared with only 3% of the local community. An intravenous drug user who worked as a cook was identified as the source. A case-control study was done to identify the vehicle of transmission. Case-patients were more likely than controls to have eaten hamburger buns and pickles, the only foods routinely handled after cooking. Of the restaurant patrons included in the study, 12 microwaved their food before consumption; none developed clinical illness despite eating large amounts of food handled after cooking. Sandwiches that were not microwaved were significantly associated with illness (odds ratio = 9.6; P less than .02). This epidemiologic evidence suggests that microwaves inactivate hepatitis A virus in food.\r"

Increased age and more severe underlying illness were associated with increased risk of C. difficile carriage and diarrhea. Multivariate models adjusting for age and severity of underlying disease associated two risk factors with asymptomatic C. difficile carriage: stool softeners (relative risk [RR] = 2.04) and antacids (RR = 1.80). Five risk factors were associated with C. difficile-associated diarrhea: cephalosporin use (RR = 2.07), penicillin use (RR = 3.41), enemas (RR = 3.26), gastrointestinal stimulants (RR = 3.06), and stool softeners (RR = 1.74). C. difficile was a common nosocomial infection on this ward, resulting in asymptomatic carriage more often than diarrhea and accounting for one-fifth of all cases of nosocomial diarrhea.\r"

Similar significant differences were found for verbal and performance IQ scores. For the Metropolitan Achievement Test, we found that middle ear disease in the first 3 years of life was associated with significantly lower scores in mathematics and reading. Similar differences were found for articulation and use of morphologic markers. After considering time spent with MEE during the first 3 years of life, time spent after age 3 years was not a significant predictor of scores on any of the tests administered.\r"

Thirty-six patients harbored mixed aerobic and anaerobic microbial flora, and the anaerobic gram-positive cocci were the predominant isolates recovered. The mean microbial recovery for patients with an acute abscess was 2.9 isolates, while in patients with chronic infections the mean microbial recovery was 5. The anaerobic populations outnumbered facultative isolates by two to one, and 34% of anaerobic isolates were recovered from subculture. These findings demonstrate that, contrary to previous reports, nonpuerperal breast infections involve a mixed infection that is primarily anaerobic.\r"

The relative efficacy of each antibiotic was compared to vancomycin in a rabbit model of aortic valve endocarditis caused by either a methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant strain of beta-lactamase-producing S. aureus. beta-lactamase inhibitors clavulanate and sulbactam were used in combination with ticarcillin and ampicillin, respectively. All beta-lactam antibiotics were effective against the susceptible strain. beta-lactam antibiotic activity in vitro and in vivo against the resistant strain correlated with its affinity for binding to PBP 2a. Lack of efficacy of beta-lactam antibiotics for the resistant strain was due to an inability to eradicate the resistant subpopulation of cells. Vancomycin was the most effective agent.\r"

Neutralizing antibodies were detected against the HIV-IIIB laboratory strain of HIV-1 and against a clinical isolate from another HIV-1-infected individual. Sera from the subject under investigation possessed differential ability to enact viral neutralization, depending on which homotypic clinical isolate was used. In general, it appeared that effective neutralization capacity was present in serum against homotypic viral isolates of HIV-1 only if these isolates were obtained at or before serum collection. These data suggest that variants of HIV-1 in infected individuals may not be effectively neutralized by antibodies that have been generated in these same people against previously dominant viral strains.\r"

Eighty-eight of them had received a mean of 18.6 transfusions of red blood cells between 1978 and 1985, and none was positive for the HIV antibody. Of 116 patients, 9 (7.8%) tested positive for HTLV-I antibodies. HTLV-I-positive patients were similar to those without HTLV-I antibody with respect to age, number of transfusions, and proportion of patients with greater than 40 transfusions. However, 3 of the 9 HTLV-I-positive patients came from West Africa or from the Caribbean, whereas this proportion was much lower (7/107) in the HTLV-I-negative group (x2, 7.564; P less than .01). Our analysis suggests that the risk of HIV infection in transfused sickle cell disease patients is low. Although HTLV-I antibodies in these patients may not be related to blood transfusions, it seems prudent to screen blood donors for HTLV-I infection.\r"

Detergent-soluble envelope glycoproteins were used as vaccine antigens for intranasal immunization of hamsters. The immunized animals showed complete protection from challenge infection with prototype live virus but failed to demonstrate a significant level of protection against either human parainfluenza type 1 or type 3 virus. The sera and bronchial lavages of immunized animals also showed type-specific neutralizing antibodies. A similar type-specific protective immune response was also noted after primary infection with live virus. The results indicate that a multivalent parainfluenza virus vaccine is probably required for protection against natural infection.\r"

The half-lives of drug leakage in human plasma and in 0.9% NaCl were 15 and 47 h, respectively. After intraventricular injection with a stereotaxic apparatus, DDC levels within the central nervous system decreased exponentially, with a half-life of 1.1 h for the unencapsulated DDC and 23 h for the liposome-encapsulated DDC. There were no abnormalities observed in the behavior of the rats. Encapsulation of a more hydrophilic antiviral agent is expected to increase the half-life even further. The results of this study offer the possibility of a practical intrathecal drug delivery for drugs that do not cross the blood-brain barrier.\r"

Adaptation of new isolates to continuous cell culture growth has been much more successful in HL cells. Centrifugation of inoculum and incorporation of cycloheximide in the medium enhanced the infectivity. Microscopic observation of cultures from days 2 to 6 showed that C. pneumoniae undergoes a second cycle of growth in HL cells. However, the optimal time of harvesting is 3 days after inoculation.\r"

Also, four reference borderline-susceptible isolates from the Centers for Disease Control belonged to phage group 94/96 and possessed pBW15. Screening of 43 other phage group 94/96 isolates demonstrated that 36 (84%) contained pBW15 and exhibited the borderline phenotype. In contrast, pBW15 was not identified among 10 penicillin-susceptible, 10 methicillin-resistant, and 40 penicillin-resistant but non-borderline-susceptible S. aureus. These data show a close association between pBW15, phage group 94/96, and the borderline-susceptible phenotype. Furthermore, these isolates were associated with infections in multiple institutions, suggesting the widespread dissemination of a clinically important and pathogenic strain of S. aureus.\r"

Of the 95 sera containing antibodies to total parasite protein, 95% demonstrated antibodies to the 170-kDa heavy subunit but not to the 35-kDa light lectin subunit. All sera (n = 253) were tested by ELISA for antibodies to lectin: 99% from liver abscess patients and all 4 from individuals asymptomatically infected with pathogenic E. histolytica were positive; all from the 40 healthy American controls and the 29 infected with other parasites were negative (P less than .01). The prevalence of serum anti-lectin antibodies was identical (25%) in asymptomatic South Africans with either a nonpathogenic infection or a negative stool culture for E. histolytica.

  ".W": "Placenta eluted gamma globulins (PEGG) contain antibodies against class II HLA antigens and have been used for treating patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In view of the potential use of antibodies to class II HLA for treating autoimmune diseases we looked for the immunobiological effects of PEGG injections in patients. No modulation of class II HLA was seen at the surface of circulating mononuclear cells after one week of daily PEGG injections. In some patients, antibodies to F(ab')2 fragments of PEGG-IgG were produced. These antibodies reacted against F(ab')2 of any IgG as well and did not prevent anticlass II HLA antibodies from binding to class II HLA, thus showing no characteristics of classical antiidiotypic antibodies. The appearance of anti-F(ab')2 antibodies was not correlated with the clinical course of the disease. Their significance is discussed.\r"
