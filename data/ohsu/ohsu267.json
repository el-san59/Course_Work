Hospitalized children with acute lower-respiratory-tract infection (ALRI) were studied to determine case-fatality rates (CFR) and predictors for mortality. Incidence rates were highest in infants, 3.2-4.0 per person, followed by children one to four years of age, with corresponding rates of 3.0-3.4 per person. The risk factors for ARI morbidity were low socioeconomic status and age less than one year. A CFR of 5% in children with ALRI was observed. Malnutrition and a positive culture of blood were significant risk factors for mortality. These identified risk factors underscore the value of primary health care interventions, such as the standard ARI case management, immunization, health education, promotion of breast-feeding, and vitamin A supplementation, as strategies for reducing ARI mortality in developing countries.\r"

Age greater than 65 y (199 patients) and heart (90 patients) and metabolic diseases (151 patients) did not increase the relative frequency of febrile RI, and vaccine administration caused no apparent reduction in frequency of RI. During the influenza B period, no differences in RI were observed between the groups, and the frequency of RI was unrelated to vaccination. Variability in virus and vaccine specificities may have been important. Except for one subset of specific virus and host conditions, no overall reduction in influenza-like or total RI was observed from vaccinating ambulatory, high-risk patients.\r"

Twenty-six individuals had rises in titer of antibody to F glycoprotein, 27 to G glycoprotein, and 28 had rises in titer of neutralizing antibody. The antibody responses to homologous and heterologous F glycoproteins were not significantly different. In contrast, homologous vs. heterologous antibody responses to G glycoprotein were significantly different, with 7.3% relatedness between the G glycoproteins of subgroups A and B.

The duration and magnitude of replication of human and bovine PIV-3 in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of New World monkeys was similar, and animals infected with bovine PIV-3 developed resistance to challenge with human PIV-3. The replication of two bovine strains of PIV-3 was restricted 100- to 1000-fold in Old World primates but was sufficient to induce high levels of neutralizing antibody to human PIV-3. The combined properties of restricted replication and induction of a protective immune response to human PIV-3 in nonhuman primates make bovine PIV-3 a promising candidate for a live-virus vaccine to protect humans against disease caused by PIV-3.\r"

None had evidence of recent infection. Next, 192 women with unknown exposure to B19 who had stillbirths or spontaneous abortions were studied. Two patients and two controls had evidence of recent B19 infection. In a second case-control study of women who had stillbirths after outbreaks of erythema infectiosum in area schools, none of the 20 patients or 26 controls were IgM positive at the time of delivery. The rate of infection, as demonstrated by IgM positivity, among 267 pregnant control subjects was approximately 1%.

RV strains infecting older, symptomatic children from the infant-toddler ward were used for comparison. Among the 39 patients enrolled in the study, RV was detected in the stools of 13 (33%), 11 (86%) of whom were asymptomatic. Three different electropherotypes were seen among the newborns who were RV positive; these electropherotypes were identical to those identified in older children with community-acquired diarrhea and nosocomial-acquired diarrhea who were hospitalized on the infant-toddler ward during the same study period. Each of the three strains was first identified in the general ward and subsequently detected in the room with newborns within three to six days. We failed to identify a particular strain that exclusively infected newborns.\r"

Intraperitoneal administration of 225 mg of intravenous human immune globulin (IVIG) immediately after intrapulmonic inoculation of GBS significantly lessened the degree of neutropenia and prevented depletion of the neutrophil storage pool and death. No effect of IVIG on neutrophil production was observed in vitro, in cultures of granulocytic progenitor cells, or in vivo, as assessed by quantifying circulating and storage pools in normal neonatal rats injected with IVIG. IVIG, however, markedly hastened release of neutrophils from the reserves into the blood and hastened the arrival of neutrophils at the site of the bacterial injection (the right lung). Specific antibody to GBS, as opposed to a nonspecific IgG effect, appeared to be responsible for the improvements in neutrophils kinetics and for survival of the animals.\r"

Quantitative cultures of blood and kidney from the animals were performed to evaluate protection. Immunization with whole bacteria protected mice against infection with the homologous strain. Mice immunized with PCP were protected when challenged intravenously with either a highly encapsulated S. aureus strain or a microencapsulated mutant but not with an unencapsulated mutant. Protection correlated with capsular antibody levels in the immunized animals. Immunity to staphylococcal infection could be passively transferred to naive animals by using immune serum. These experiments suggest that the S. aureus capsular polysaccharide merits further study as a potential vaccine candidate for preventing staphylococcal infection.\r"

Nineteen infants received DTP-AC vaccine, and 20 infants received DTP-WC vaccine. Significantly more infants who received DTP-WC vaccine manifested fever, swelling, and/or total reactions than did infants who received DTP-AC vaccine. Infants who received DTP-AC vaccine had comparable antibody titers to LPF and significantly higher titers to FHA after three immunizations, as compared with the infants who received DTP-WC vaccine (P less than or equal to .001). The DTP-WC vaccine stimulated higher pertussis agglutination titers (P = .04) than did DTP-AC.

The polypeptides were examined as antigens for reaction with pre- and postvaccination sera from infants receiving either a Bordetella pertussis whole-cell vaccine or a vaccine containing pertussis toxoid. An elevated serum titer was noted upon vaccination with both types of vaccines when bovine serum albumin conjugates of five synthetic peptides were used as antigens. Similarly, mice immunized with whole-cell pertussis vaccine showed an elevated titer against all five peptides that were reactive with human sera.

Mean activity in infected HCVE was 662 +/- 149 (mU/10(5) HCVE +/- 1 SD) versus 221 +/- 78 in control HCVE; surface-expressed activity was 57 +/- 25 in infected monolayers and undetectable (less than or equal to 10) in controls.

The second was a strain of Streptococcus mitis recovered from the bloodstream of a leukemic patient with neutropenia. Both patients failed to respond to penicillin. The mechanism of resistance in these strains was associated with diminished affinity for penicillin of their penicillin-binding proteins, as compared with those of penicillin-susceptible control strains. We conclude that penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci may cause serious infections even in patients not receiving chronic penicillin therapy, that this resistance is clinically significant and may result in failure of penicillin therapy, and that the mechanism of resistance in these strains is associated with diminished affinity of the penicillin-binding proteins for penicillin.\r"

Of three subjects (household contacts of patients with leprosy) who later developed the disease, one with lepromatous and one with indeterminate leprosy were seropositive by ELISAs using the three antigens before the clinical onset of disease; one who developed borderline tuberculoid leprosy was seronegative. The predictive value of a positive result for the test was very low (less than 2.4%) and the predictive value for a negative result was high (greater than 99.9%) because of the low prevalence of leprosy in French Polynesia (1.78 per 1000). The high sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency of the tests using the three antigens confirmed their great value for serodiagnosis of leprosy, especially the multibacillary form; the ELISA using NTP seems to be more specific and sensitive for detecting the paucibacillary form.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical trial of Q fever vaccine in four South Australian abattoirs showed apparently complete protection against natural infection; however, only 50%-60% of vaccinees developed complement-fixing or immunofluorescent antibody after vaccination. Cell-mediated immunity to Coxiella burnetii antigens, as measured by an index of lymphoproliferative responses (LSI) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, was therefore assessed. Eighty-five percent of 13 subjects with \"low risk\" of exposure to Q fever and with an initially negative LSI converted to a positive LSI after vaccination; conversion was noted nine to 13 days after vaccination, and positive values were obtained for at least 96 d. Only 35% of this group seroconverted. In a \"high-risk\" group (abattoir workers), higher rates of positive LSI (greater than 95%) and of antibody (50%-70%) were observed after vaccination; greater than 95% of vaccinees in this group, who had been vaccinated five years previously, had positive LSI values.\r"

Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect IgG, IgM, and IgA to G. lamblia trophozoites, we tested sera from 29 patients with AIDS (15 without and 14 with G. lamblia infection); 20 healthy homosexual men; and 91 immunocompetent heterosexual subjects, 25 of whom were infected with G. lamblia. Heterosexual subjects infected with G. lamblia had significantly higher levels of all three classes of specific antibody than did the uninfected subjects (P less than .0001). Patients with AIDS who had acute symptomatic giardiasis had significantly lower levels of all antibodies than did the heterosexual subjects who had giardiasis; specific IgM was absent in all but one patient with AIDS. The symptomatically infected patients with AIDS had low levels of G. lamblia-specific antibodies that were similar to those of the uninfected patients with AIDS. Patients with AIDS do not have to suffer from prolonged symptomatic G. lamblia infections, however, because available therapy is effective against the parasite, independent of a patient's immune status.\r"

  ".W": "Sera from hemophiliacs were analyzed for antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP), western blotting (WB) with nonreducing buffer (NR), and WB with reducing buffer (R). We analyzed envelope gp160, gp120, and gp41; pol gene proteins p64, p53, and p34; and gag gene protein p24. Of 215 samples positive for reactivity to gp160 and gp120(RIP), antibodies to p24 were undetectable in 2 (0.9%), to gp41 in 9 (4.2%), to the pol antigens in 5 (2.3%), to gp120(NR) in 3 (1.4%), and to gp120(R) in 55 (25.6%). By sequential analysis of samples, antibodies to gp120(NR), gp120(R), p24, gp41, p64/53, and p34 were observed later in the course of infection than were antibodies to gp120(RIP) or gp160. This result suggests caution against reliance on WB as the \"gold standard.\" A significantly higher rate of progression to AIDS-related complex was found for individuals lacking antibodies to gp120(R). It is possible that antigenic domains represented by gp120(R) may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether a group of family physicians in an academic medical center followed recent recommendations in the recognition and treatment of young patients with elevated cholesterol levels. Patient charts were reviewed retrospectively in 94.1 percent of the 1,129 patients aged between 30 and 39 years seen in the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Family Health Center over a one-year period. Only 346, or 32.6 percent, of the charts reviewed contained the patient's cholesterol values. Ninety-nine patients had serum cholesterol levels greater than the recommended treatment level of 5.70 mmol/L (220 mg/dL). Of patients with elevated cholesterol levels, only 34.1 percent were treated. There was no difference in the treatment rates of faculty members' patients as compared with residents' patients. The incidence of treatment increased linearly with respect to rising cholesterol values. This study identified the relative infrequency with which cholesterol levels appear in the charts of patients aged 30 to 39 years. It also illustrated that significantly more physician effort is required to meet suggested treatment guidelines for patients with elevated cholesterol levels. The cholesterol \"normal ranges\" that are reported on laboratory result sheets, which are not age-specific, may be misleading, and consequently affect patient care.\r"

Participants completed a survey and a test of commonly used medical vocabulary. The two populations did not differ significantly in education level or in vocabulary test scores. Deaf patients were often less able to speak to their physician in their customary language (sign language); as a result, they perceive greater difficulties in expressing themselves to their physicians and reexplain themselves less frequently in response to misunderstandings. It is clear that deaf patients should be recognized as a subset of non-English-speaking patients who are at increased risk for poor physician-patient communication.\r"

This study examines detection rates in terms of the patient's presenting complaint, the clinical encounter, and the resident's attitudes. Over four months 218 patients of the family practice center of a large community hospital completed a survey that included the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (SMAST). Chart audits of each patient's visit assessed each resident's behavior in recording questions about the patient's use of alcohol. After the first four months, each resident completed a survey of his or her experiences and attitudes concerning alcoholism. Using the SMAST scores and chart audits, 25 of the 218 patients were identified as alcoholic. The residents detected only 12 of the 25 alcoholics. Of 51 patients who presented for physical examinations, the residents recorded asking only 28 about their drinking; of 157 patients who presented for more limited visits, the residents recorded asking only six about their drinking. Residents rated the alcoholic patient as less motivated, more dangerous, less hopeful, and much sicker than the average person. First-year residents rated alcoholics much more negatively than did upper-level residents. The SMAST again proved to be much more effective than clinical interviews in detecting alcoholism in patients.\r"

Time constraints, however, often make it difficult for the physician to explore these areas in detail with every patient. One approach that can be helpful is the use of a simple questionnaire that can be completed by the patient in advance of seeing the physician. The use of one questionnaire, the Multifactor Health Inventory (MHI), in filling the need for such an instrument is detailed. The MHI helps the physician screen for psychophysiologic, psychiatric, attitudinal, and substance abuse problems. It also provides direction for productive follow-up interviewing. Research has shown that many patients with psychosocial problems are not identified by the physician. A questionnaire can help increase physician awareness of these patients and their problems.\r"

Two years after this randomization, follow-up data were obtained on 194 of the 198 subjects to assess the program's effectiveness. Fifty-one of the subjects had died. There were an increased number of deaths in the experimental group (30 percent) compared with the control group (21 percent), although this difference was not statistically significant. No statistically significant differences were found between the remaining 143 experimental and control group patients in function or well-being. Patients in the experimental group had a significantly higher number of hospitalizations, although there was no difference in the number of days spent in the hospital. Although methodologic considerations limit the ability to draw policy conclusions from this follow-up study, this home visit program did not have a measurable sustained impact on health outcomes or utilization of health services.\r"

Thirty six \"control\" patients were admitted in the same time period with low back pain and sciatica but with subsequently \"normal\" myelograms and no surgery. The aim of this paper was to relate history and clinical signs to the myelograms and surgical findings. Ninety nine per cent of our patients presented with sciatica (controls 94%). The most frequently found sign in patients with a disc protrusion was reduction of ipsilateral straight leg raising (98%). However, 55% of controls also showed this sign. There were three signs that, when present, particularly indicated a disc protrusion; \"crossed straight leg raising\" (pain on contralateral straight leg raising), measured calf wasting and impaired ankle reflex: the latter being especially indicative of an L5-S1 disc protrusion. There were two further important signs, weakness of dorsiflexion of the foot and scoliosis of the lumbar spine. However, such signs occurred in about half the patients and so clinical diagnosis in the remaining half depended on obtaining a good history of sciatica, and paying due regard to severity of the pain, the mobility of the patient, the ability and desire to work and the overall personality. Satisfactory results of surgery simply depend on finding and removing a definite disc protrusion. Using these methods of selection, 98% have returned to their original employment, 86% within 3 months of the operation. For a patient with no abnormal signs and a normal myelogram, surgical treatment should not be advised.\r"

  ".W": "High voltage percutaneous electrical stimulation over the lumbosacral spinal column was used to assess conduction in the cauda equina of 13 normal subjects. Electromyographic activity elicited by such stimulation was recorded from various muscles of the lower limbs. The stimulating cathode was placed over the spinous process of each vertebral body and the anode kept on the iliac crest contralateral to the studied limb. Shifting the cathode in a rostro-caudal direction shortened the response latency in quadriceps, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum brevis muscles. At moderate intensities (60% maximum), this occurred abruptly when the cathode was placed at levels corresponding to the exit sites from the spinal canal of the roots innervating these muscles. At these intensities, the size of the response in each muscle was largest when the cathode was placed over the conus medullaris or at or below the exit of the motor roots from the spine. Latencies were always equal to or shorter than those obtained with F-wave measurements, suggesting that peripheral motor axons, rather than intraspinal structures were activated by the stimulus. Collision experiments demonstrated that activation occurred at two sites: near the spinal cord and at the root exit site in the vertebral foramina. Recordings made from soleus indicated that larger diameter proprioceptive afferent fibres also could be activated. This technique might have useful clinical applications in the study of both proximal and distal lesions of the cauda equina and provide a non-invasive method of localising such lesions electrophysiologically.\r"

In order to evaluate the reliability of various \"radicular SEP patterns\" as described in the literature, absolute latencies and side-to-side differences of the brachial plexus component from the supraclavicular fossa (N9), the medullary component (N13) from the cervical vertebra Cv7, and the primary cortical component (N20, P25) were assessed. Side-to-side differences of the amplitudes of N20/P25 and of the conduction times across the intervertebral fossa (interval N9-N13) were analysed. After nerve stimulation, 68% of the patients had false negative findings on the symptomatic, while 36% had positive findings on the asymptomatic side. After segmental stimulation, 72% of the patients had false negative findings on the symptomatic, while 22% had positive findings on the asymptomatic side. It is concluded that SEPs following nerve and segmental stimulation do not reliably confirm clear-cut already established diagnoses of unilateral radiculopathy with sensory and motor deficit. Therefore, they will not be helpful in the electrophysiological investigation of cervicobrachialgias of unknown origin.\r"

Physostigmine allowed 75 patients to ejaculate and 15 of them procreated. The possibility of ejaculation after physostigmine mainly depended on the integrity of the T12-L2 metamers. The testicular volume was significantly smaller in patients with a lesion including the T12 metamer than in patients with a lesion sparing the T12 metamer. Six patients with a lesion including the T12 metamer had testicular atrophy. This suggests that T12 segment plays a role in testicular function in paraplegic patients.\r"

Recordings of movement-related potentials in one patient showed an attenuated Bereitschaftspotential and a greater asymmetry of the NS' component of the premotor negativity with left finger than with right finger movement. The impairment of bimanual motor control and associated abnormal motor behaviour of the right hand in these cases are postulated to be due to involvement of the supplementary motor area and related areas of the medial frontal cortex.\r"

Despite greater bimanual movement initiation asynchrony and overall bradykinesia, the Parkinson's disease subjects were affected by the experimental manipulations in the same way as controls. Symmetrical and, more especially, asymmetrical bimanual movements required more preparation time and were executed more slowly by both groups than were unimanual movements. Both groups also showed temporal linkage of movements to targets of different extents--movements which have different movement times when performed unimanually, as well as of the faster and slower limbs. A majority in both groups over-compensated for asynchrony in bimanual movement initiation by modulation of movement times, but there was no group difference in this tendency. The results are discussed in terms of underlying motor control processes and with regard to previous evidence for impaired control of simultaneous movements in Parkinson's disease.\r"

  ".W": "Normal subjects performed bilaterally symmetric rapid elbow flexions or extensions (\"focal movements\") while standing. Specific patterns of electromyographic activity in leg and trunk muscles (\"associated postural adjustments\") were seen for each type of movement. The biomechanical significance of these postural adjustments was analysed by means of the ground reaction forces and motion of the various body segments. Experimental data were compared with that from a theoretical model of the body consisting of a six segment kinetic chain with rigid links. Distinct patterns of the ground reaction forces with elbow flexion were opposite in direction to those seen with elbow extension. Movements of the various body segments were small and specific for a certain focal movement. Dynamic perturbations arising from the arm movement in an anteroposterior direction were found to be compensated by postural adjustments, whereas vertical perturbations were not compensated. The muscular activity acting about different joints in the different movements was found to correlate with the predictions of activity needed to compensate for net joint reaction moments arising from the focal movement. Motion of the various body segments could be understood as resulting from the interplay of the net reaction moments and the net muscular moments at the different joints. Dynamic postural requirements are accomplished by a precise active compensation initiated before the focal movement.\r"

However, only one (2%) of these patients was demented according to DSM III criteria. Dementia was more frequent in patients with equivalent disease duration, but with late onset of disease (over 60 years); 13 of such patients (25%) were demented. The present study supports previous findings which show that dementia increases with advancing age in Parkinson's disease. It also suggests that cognitive changes are also found in patients with early onset of disease.\r"

An ischaemic exercise test produced a slow and incomplete rise in lactate. Histological examination showed non-specific myopathic changes in some quadriceps femoris muscle fibres. Investigation of muscle metabolism by spectrofluorometric analysis of muscle enzyme activity and by muscle fibre incubation studies revealed a severe defect in glucose phosphorylation, associated with an electrophoretically abnormal hexokinase. Further metabolic studies suggest that the block in glucose metabolism is by-passed via an enhanced phosphorylation of fructose by the abnormal hexokinase.\r"

In all, 41% of all multiple sclerosis cases showed some evidence of vein damage. Occasional control cases showed haemosiderin deposition in the brain but, unlike the multiple sclerosis cases, these were diffuse and almost entirely related to coexistent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease. Haemosiderin deposition was common in the substantia nigra and other pigmented nuclei in all cases. It is concluded that the cerebral vein wall in multiple sclerosis is subject to chronic inflammatory damage, which promotes haemorrhage and increased permeability, and constitutes a form of vasculitis.\r"

Forty six patients had bilateral angiography from which it was possible to assess collateral filling of the internal carotid and middle cerebral arteries. As expected, patients with no CT scan evidence of infarction more frequently had transient ischaemic attacks or retinal infarcts than did those with visible cerebral infarcts. Patients with small cortical ischaemic lesions usually had appropriate neuropsychological or neurological deficits. Three patients with cortical watershed infarcts had a fluctuating deficit. Of the patients with bilateral angiograms 67% showed some filling via collaterals of the middle cerebral artery, and 43% of the internal carotid artery in the siphon. Those with collateral filling were mostly found to have normal CT scans or evidence of peripheral cortical lesions. By contrast most watershed and full territory infarcts were found in individuals whose angiograms showed no collateral filling. It is suggested that in many cases infarction occurs despite collateral flow and is due to distal embolism and that this may be relevant to the recently reported failure of the EC/IC bypass operation.\r"

One son, with systemic carnitine deficiency causing muscle weakness and recurrent episodes of severe hepatic encephalopathy, died at 3 years of age. His brother had mild proximal muscle weakness associated with low muscle carnitine levels. He was successfully treated with L-carnitine and prednisone. A daughter is asymptomatic, but with low serum and muscle levels of carnitine. The marked heterogeneity of carnitine deficiency states within one family, where both parents had low muscle carnitine levels, suggests an autosomal recessive inheritance with variable expression.\r"

The ratio of MAG3 to OIH clearance was 0.61 +/- 0.08 as a result of its smaller volume of distribution, ratio 0.65 +/- 0.09, for the clearance half-lives were similar, ratio 1.09 +/- 0.12. A Phase II study performed serially in 20 patients with equal doses of [99mTc]MAG3 and [123I]OIH gave images of equal quality. The relative renal functions were highly correlated (r = 0.97, p less than 0.001) and transit time analyses gave good correlations: parenchymal transit time index r = 0.81, p less than 0.05. We conclude that [99mTc]MAG3 has some advantages over [99mTc]DTPA and is a suitable replacement for [123I]hippuran in routine renal imaging, relative function, and transit time studies, but not for the accurate estimation of the renal plasma flow.\r"

The FPRNA regurgitant fraction (RF) was computed in 26 individuals: 13 patients (eight mitral, three aortic, and two mitral-aortic) and 13 controls. The reference method was contrast ventriculography (CV) performed within 1 hr after FPRNA. In 19 patients, CV was preceded by the determination of cardiac output, using indocyanine green dye (n = 16) or thermodilution technique (n = 3), to determine a catheterization regurgitant fraction (CATH-RF). Lung and left ventricular (LV) time-activity curves were gathered by factor analysis and the FPRNA regurgitant fraction assessed by a lagged normal deconvolution of these curves. In valvular regurgitation, the LV deconvolved curve demonstrates the appearance of a long transit time component that is amenable to quantification. The presence of regurgitation was determined by contrast ventriculography. With a 10% RF as an acceptable upper limit of normal for nonregurgitant patients, FPRNA yielded one false-negative and no false-positive studies (n = 26), while CATH-RF yielded two false-negative and four false-positive determinations (n = 19). The following are results of quantitative determination of RF (mean +/- s.d.): FPRNA 0.39 +/- 0.19 (n = 13 Valvular), 0.01 +/- 0.03 (n = 13 Controls); CATH 0.34 +/- 0.24 (n = 11 Valvular), 0.13 +/- 0.12 (n = eight controls). FPRNA was able to differentiate (p less than 0.001) between control patients (CV grading 0) and mild/moderate regurgitation (CV grading 1+ or 2+) and severe regurgitation (3+ or 4+) (p less than 0.025).\r"

Dual photon absorptiometry was used to examine the spine, femoral neck, Ward's triangle, and greater trochanter while the radius and ulna were studied with single photon absorptiometry. All studies were performed on the same day. Concurrent measurements were available for the spine and hip in 197 patients, for the spine and forearm in 151 patients, and at all three sites for 146 patients. Variable degrees of correlation were found among the mineral content values from the six sites, with r values ranging from 0.40 to 0.93. The femoral neck and Ward's triangle showed the highest degree of correlation (r = 0.93); the ulna and lumbar spine demonstrated the poorest correlation (r = 0.40). Relationships between distant anatomic sites exhibited a large amount of variability (large standard error of the estimate) even when highly correlated. Useful predictions of bone mineral content could be obtained only for sites in close proximity. These results suggest that bone mineral content determinations in the upper extremities by single photon absorptiometry may not be useful for predicting mineralization in clinically more significant areas such as the lumbar spine and hip.\r"

In 25 rats bearing Walker-256 carcinomas tumor-to-muscle glu uptake averaged 6.34 +/- 2.84 (s.d.) prior to interventions and the respective uptake of but was 6.79 +/- 3.08 (y = 0.03 + 0.94x). One hour after selective intraarterial administration of methotrexate (mtx), glu uptake fell by 47%, whereas blood flow remained within the pretreatment range (N = 9). Four hours after mtx, perfusion was reduced by approximately 40%, and 2 days later both perfusion and glu uptake reached extremely low levels. No significant difference in the effect of 10 and 50 mg/kg mtx was observed. Regional tissue mtx uptake estimations using 77Br-labeled bromomethotrexate did not reveal any significant uptake in muscle. The relationship between tumor-to-muscle uptake of glu and but (13N/11C-index) was 0.94 +/- 0.015 (s.e.m., N = 25) before intervention. After methotrexate (1 hr, 4 hr, and 2 days) this index was 0.58 +/- 0.06 (N = 9), and 0.85 +/- 0.04 (N = 11) and 1.03 +/- 0.05 (N = 5), respectively. These values demonstrate an early mtx-induced uncoupling of glu uptake with respect to perfusion.\r"

At the time of maximum tumor concentration of nonradioactive antibody, the blood is quickly cleared of excess circulating nonradioactive antibody using a special i.v. \"chase\". The radiolabel then is given and imaging done in 1 to 3 hr. The use of short lived tracers (hours) to image antibodies that localize slowly (days) in-vivo is made possible by this method.\r"

The lumbar spines of 13 cadavers were used. BMC and BMD were measured in situ and on the excised vertebrae in a solution of water/ethanol; and covered with ox muscle/porcine muscle/lard. The actual mineral weight and areal density were determined after chemical maceration, fat extraction, drying to a constant weight, ashing for 24 hr at 600 degrees C, and correction for the transverse processes. The true are was measured by parallax free X rays and planimetry. All measurements of BMC or BMD were highly interrelated (r = 0.94-0.99). The standard error of estimate (s.e.e.) of BMC in situ versus BMC in water/ethanol was 5.2%. The agreement between the BMD values of the two scanners was very good (s.e.e. = 2.9%). BMC in situ predicted the actual vertebral mineral mass with an s.e.e. of 8.1%. BMD in situ and BMD in water/ethanol predicted the actual area density with s.e.e.s of 10.3% and 5.0%, respectively. This study discloses the correlation and accuracy error of spinal DPA measurements in situ in whole cadavers versus the actual BMC and BMD. The error, which is underestimated in in vitro studies, amounts to 10%.\r"

First-pass radionuclide angiography (FPRA) was performed and results were compared to those obtained with FPRA using a multicrystal camera (MCC) and 99mTc in 38 patients. The overall left ventricular count sensitivity (counts/mCi/sec/millisteradians [msr]) was significantly higher with MWGC/178Ta (176 +/- 132 versus 108 +/- 49, p less than 0.001) yielding images of higher statistics with higher resolution collimation (31 versus 63 msr). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.54 +/- 0.18 by MWGC and 0.54 +/- 0.18 by MCC with an excellent correlation between the two techniques (r = 0.94, s.e.e. = 0.06). The detection of wall motion abnormality was virtually identical with the two techniques. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility by MWGC was excellent (r = 0.99 and 0.99, respectively). Thus, this new technology provides first-pass studies of higher statistical quality and improved resolution, affording more precise assessment of left ventricular performance and likelihood of further substantial improvement by use of even higher doses of 178Ta.\r"

The distribution and rotation of washout abnormalities seen over the cavity when viewed en face, and the long delay between the termination of stress and post-exercise image acquisition, suggest that apparent cavitary dilation is often related to improved visibility of the 201T1 deficient blood pool due to relative ischemia of the overlying myocardial wall.\r"

Twenty-five patients with previously documented disease received an intravenous infusion of 2.5 to 40 mg of monoclonal antibody with 1 mg of the antibody labeled with 5 mCi of 111In. There were no acute reactions. Patients were scanned without computer enhancement or background subtraction techniques at 24 and 72 hr after injection. Imaging detected tumor in 14/18 (78%) patients with active disease, identified 24/44 (77%) of lesions greater than 1 cm and changed or specifically directed patient management in 22% (4/18) patients with tumor. There was a prolongation in blood clearance associated with decreased liver and spleen activity following administration of 20 and 40 mg of antibody compared to the three lower antibody dose levels. Assuming a biodistribution similar to [111In]ZME-018, the radiation dose delivered to normal tissues by [90Y]ZME-018 would restrict its use as a routine vehicle for radioimmunotherapy; however, it may be possible to deliver substantial tumor doses in selected patients.\r"

The synthesis requires approximately 30 min after the end of 11CO2 collection and gives alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan in a 20-25% radiochemical yield calculated at the end of the synthesis and without correction for radioactive decay. The specific activity of the final radiopharmaceutical, measured at the end of the synthesis, was around 2,000 Ci/mmol. Data confirming the stereospecificity of the synthesis are also presented.\r"

Nine of ten subjects were studied with a nonimaging Nal probe, and the tenth with a high-resolution Germanium detector. Placing multiple energy windows over the energy spectra, EF was found to vary with the energy window selected. Moving a 20% window across the photopeak produced a roughly linear increase in EF with energy (2.3 EF units per 10 keV increase in energy) in eight of the ten subjects. Dividing the photopeak into a low (126-140 keV) and high-energy (140-154 keV) portion gave significantly different EFs (high energy exceeding low energy by 17%). Increasing the width of a narrow window centered about the photopeak produced negligible change in EF. Examining the energy spectra showed that the small-angle scattered radiation (126-139 keV) was proportionately greater at end systole than at end diastole, after normalizing the spectra to the same photopeak area.\r"

Recent excretion models have calculated that breast feeding could safely resume 56 days following a 5 microCi (0.185 MBq) 131I maternal tracer dose. We studied a postpartum patient with Graves' disease following first an uptake dose of 8.6 microCi (0.317 MBq) and then for 38 days following a 9.6 mCi (355 MBq) therapy dose of Na131I. We calculated from our data that although nursing could not be safely resumed for 46 days following the 8.6-microCi uptake dose, nursing could resume in this patient 8 days after a 100-nCi (3.7 KBq) dose. Extrapolating this data to impure 123I (p, 2n or p, 5n) we feel that standard 100-microCi (3.7 MBq) doses of either 123I preparation is not suitable if nursing is to be resumed.\r"

Nursing administrators are responsible for minimizing the negative impact of a merger on nurses while simultaneously promoting merger goals. Despite this increase in mergers and the subsequent challenge to clinicians, little information is available about how to manage mergers. This article reviews the impact of the merger between the Veterans Administration Medical Center and the Kirtland Air Force Base Hospital in Albuquerque, New Mexico. A nursing perspective is used to understand what problems arise and how nursing administrators can effectively manage these problems.\r"

A total of 237 previously healthy febrile infants were seen at the Pediatric Emergency Room over 17 1/2 months. One hundred forty-eight infants (63%) fulfilled the criteria for being at low risk: no physical findings consisting of soft tissue or skeletal infections, no purulent otitis media, normal urinalysis, less than 25 white blood cells per high-power field on microsopic stool examination, peripheral leukocyte count 5000 to 15,000/mm3 with less than 1500 band cells/mm3. One infant appeared too ill to be included, and had sepsis and meningitis. None of the 148 infants at low risk had bacterial infections, versus 21 of 88 (24%) of those at high risk (P less than 0.0001); eight of 88 (9%) had bacteremia. Of the 148 infants classified as being at low risk for having bacterial infection, 62 (42%) were discharged to home, and 72 (49%) were initially observed for less than or equal to 24 hours and then discharged. Seventeen infants (11%) were hospitalized: in six, low risk became high risk; six had indications other than fever; and five because the study physicians could not be found. The 137 nontreated infants were closely observed as outpatients. The duration of fever was less than 48 hours in 42%, and less than 96 hours in 91%. All infants were observed for at least 10 days after the last examination. The fever resolved spontaneously in all infants but two, with otitis media, who were treated as outpatients. Our data suggest that management of fever in selected young infants as outpatients is feasible if meticulous follow-up is provided.\r"

Asymptomatic rotavirus excretion occurred in 50% of children tested on the day before diarrhea occurred, 31% two days before diarrhea, and 9% in days 3 through 5 before diarrhea. Two children had positive specimens 11 and 13 days, respectively, before illness. During the week after cessation of diarrhea, 32% had positive specimens; 12% had positive stool specimens during the second week after diarrhea episodes. Electrophoretic testing of rotavirus RNA from stool specimens showed different electrophoretic migration patterns of the genomic RNA among the pairs tested, but the genomic RNA was the same within each pair of symptomatic and asymptomatic specimens. Excretion of rotavirus before and after diarrhea is common in children in DCCs; the role that asymptomatic excretion plays in the spread of this disease within DCCs is unknown.\r"

Three of these strains infected 44 DCC children and apparently were transmitted within the DCC environment. Only children younger than 3 years of age acquired the DCC-associated CMV strains. Of 75 seronegative children in this age group, 34 acquired DCC-associated CMV strains, and four were infected with unique strains. Among 23 children older than 3 years of age, none acquired the DCC-associated strains, although six were infected with unique strains. Of 18 seronegative mothers, six acquired CMV infections within 3 to 7 months after their children became infected; the strains were identical to those isolated from their children and were DCC associated. Four fathers, three seropositive mothers, and two caretakers also shed DCC-associated strains of CMV. None of the 31 mothers whose children were not infected shed CMV. There was no apparent CMV-associated morbidity. These results prove the frequent transmission of CMV within the DCC environment and from DCC children to their parents. They further suggest that caretakers do acquire CMV from DCC children.\r"

A significant deterioration in CF clinical status, based on NIH score, became apparent 2 years before onset of overt IDDM (P less than 0.05 at 2 years prior, P less than 0.01 at IDDM diagnosis). Total glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) was significantly (P less than 0.001) higher for the total CF population (7.3% +/- 1.2%) than for the general non-CF population (6.5% +/- 0.7%), and in the IDDM-CF group (P less than 0.05) compared with normoglycemic CF control patients. Female patients had a higher mean HbA1 after 12 years of age than their male counterparts did (P less than 0.02). HBA1 did not predict the development of IDDM, but there was a weak inverse relationship between HbA1 and both NIH clinical score (r = -0.41, P less than 0.02) and standard pulmonary function tests (forced vital capacity, r = -0.25, P less than 0.01) in the general CF population. Therefore, impaired carbohydrate tolerance in CF is associated with progressive clinical deterioration.\r"

Type of rounds was alternated in 2-week blocks for 4 months. The impact of the two types of rounds of 35 parents and children was studied. Parents preferred bedside rounds to standard rounds, and perceived increased opportunities to obtain information and ask questions. Parents and children differed in their reports of how much bedside rounds upset children. Older children, compared with younger children, more strongly disliked standard rounds; this appeared to be related to feelings of exclusion. The two types of rounds differed in their effectiveness in providing specific types of education to residents. The findings suggest that bedside rounds have a positive impact on parents' attitudes toward physicians, that they do not dilute the child's sense of relationship with the primary attending physician, and that they contribute to certain aspects of resident education.\r"

Compared with the controls, patients in cohorts 1 and 2 receiving a strict low-phenylalanine (phe) diet (average phe concentration less than 600 mumol/L) were 1.5 and 1.7 times, respectively, more likely to have deviant behavior; those receiving a less well controlled diet were 2.5 and 1.9 times, respectively, more likely to show such behavior. Patients more often had mannerisms, hyperactivity, and signs of anxiety and were less responsive and more solitary than were controls. On the other hand, they were not more aggressive, untruthful, or disobedient, nor absent from school more frequently. The increased frequency of deviant behavior may be the result of both psychologic stress and neurologic impairment.\r"

We found decreased free carnitine and increased acylcarnitine levels in the serum, a decreased free carnitine content and an elevated acyl/free carnitine ratio in the liver, and increased excretion of free and acylcarnitine in the urine. Analyses of urinary acylcarnitine using the secondary ion mass spectrometry technique revealed increased amounts of acetylcarnitine and dicarboxylic acid derivatives. These data suggest that the patients had a secondary carnitine deficiency, possibly an aggravating factor in urea cycle dysfunction. After oral administration of L-carnitine (50 to 100 mg/kg/d) in two patients, hyperammonemic episodes were less frequent. Blood ammonia levels decreased significantly, accompanied by an increase in serum free carnitine levels.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to assess the duration of ductal shunting after birth in healthy preterm infants (30 to 37 weeks gestational age) without evidence of respiratory distress. Thirty-six infants were evaluated in the first 12 hours of life by means of two-dimensional echocardiography and color flow Doppler techniques, and then once daily until no ductal flow was detected (defined as functional closure). Preterm infants were subdivided into two groups by gestational age: group 1 = 30 to 33 weeks (n = 12); group 2 = 34 to 37 weeks (n = 24). Sixteen full-term infants (38 to 41 weeks) were similarly evaluated as control subjects (Group 3). One infant from each group had a closed ductus at the time of the first study (performed at a mean of 7.7 +/- 3.2 hours). Subsequent studies for the entire group were performed at a mean of 31.3 +/- 5.4 hours (day 2), 55.0 +/- 4.5 hours (day 3), and 80.3 +/- 6.1 hours (day 4). For the three groups, the rates of ductal closure ranged from 50.0% to 58.3% on day 2 and 81.3% to 87.5% on day 3. For the entire group, all but one infant had demonstrated closure of the ductus arteriosus by day 4. Within the range of gestational ages studied, we conclude that prematurity, in the absence of respiratory distress syndrome, does not prolong the initial duration of physiologic ductal shunting.\r"

Seven infants (group 1) received indomethacin to treat a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), and eight infants (group 2) received indomethacin prophylactically at 24 hours of age because of their high risk for PDA. Diastolic cardiac function was assessed using instantaneous rates of change of left ventricular (LV) cavity dimension, derived from M-mode echocardiography. The maximum velocity of lengthening of the LV cavity dimension, an index of early diastolic function, fell from 63 +/- 19 mm/sec before indomethacin to 48 +/- 16 mm/sec 1 hour after indomethacin in group 1 (P less than 0.01), with the ductus still patent and the LV chamber still dilated, and also decreased in group 2, from 52 +/- 7 mm/sec to 38 +/- 6 mm/sec (P less than 0.01). This index, when normalized for loading conditions, was decreased 1 hour after indomethacin at 12 +/- 2 sec-1 and 12 +/- 1 sec-1 for groups 1 and 2, respectively, compared with values before indomethacin of 15 +/- 3 sec-1 and 15 +/- 2 sec-1. There was no effect of indomethacin on the indices of systolic function. We conclude that indomethacin decreases early diastolic function in premature infants.\r"

Measurements of growth and macronutrient utilization were similar to those obtained in a previous study of infants fed a preparation of fortified human milk that contained lower levels of calcium and phosphorus. However, unlike the relative hypophosphatemia, hypophosphaturia, and hypercalciuria noted in the infants in our earlier study, normal serum and urine phosphorus and urine calcium values were observed in this study. Postnatal calcium and phosphorus retentions correlated significantly with respective intakes, the absorption of fat, and the retention of nitrogen. The relationships among calcium and phosphorus intake and retention predict that 160 mg/kg/d and 94 mg/kg/d, respectively, must be fed to achieve retention equivalent to intrauterine estimates. Although postnatal retention of calcium and phosphorus may be increased to levels accumulated by the fetus, technical considerations for the preparation of a formula with sufficiently high levels of calcium and phosphorus must be resolved.\r"

Esophageal manometry was performed before and after one intravenous dose of metoclopramide (0.125 mg/kg), and esophageal pH was monitored over a 24-hour baseline period, followed by oral metoclopramide therapy (0.125 mg/kg four times a day, for 24 hours.) During pH monitoring, patients received diet for age and were kept in the prone position with the head elevated 45 degrees while sleeping. Eight patients entered a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of metoclopramide. Metoclopramide significantly (P = 0.04) increased end-expiratory LES pressure, from 14.9 +/- 7.5 mm Hg to 18.6 +/- 6.8 mm Hg. However, there was a significant (P less than 0.05) increase in the number of reflux episodes/24 hours, and no significant change in percentage of time pH was less than 4, number of episodes lasting greater than 5 minutes, or the longest episode of reflux between the 24-hour baseline and M periods. LES pressure did not correlate well with any of these measurements (r = 0.2). In the controlled trial, the three patients receiving metoclopramide, but none of those receiving placebo, were withdrawn by their parents because of exacerbation of GER symptoms and marked irritability (P = 0.01). In the placebo group, symptoms improved in four infants, but did not change in one. The use of metoclopramide in the treatment of GER of infancy needs to be reconsidered.\r"

At concentrations of 25 mM and above, ethanol produced a dose-dependent inhibition of muscarine-stimulated release of [3H]NE. The inhibition of muscarine-stimulated transmitter release occurred in the absence of any detectable effect of ethanol on [3H]NE uptake or on muscarinic binding to the cells. However, ethanol produced an inhibition of muscarine-stimulated elevation of intracellular free Ca++ which corresponded with the inhibition of transmitter release. At concentrations greater than 100 mM, ethanol produced an increase in the basal release of [3H]NE. Intracellular free Ca++ also was increased by ethanol concentrations greater than 100 mM. The elevation of basal transmitter release and intracellular free Ca++ by concentrations of ethanol greater than 100 mM occurred independently of the inhibition by ethanol of muscarine-stimulated elevation of intracellular free Ca++ and transmitter secretion. These results suggest that the effects of ethanol on neurotransmitter release are associated with the effects of ethanol on intracellular free Ca++.\r"

  ".W": "The source of Ca++ responsible for contraction was examined in muscle cells isolated separately from the circular and longitudinal muscle layers of guinea pig and human intestine. Contraction was measured by scanning micrometry and cytosolic-free Ca++ ([Ca++]i) with the fluorescent indicator, quin2. In both species, contraction induced in circular muscle cells by cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) and acetylcholine was not affected by withdrawal of Ca++ from the medium or addition of the Ca++ channel blocker, methoxyverapamil, whereas contraction induced by both agonists in longitudinal muscle cells and by depolarizing concentrations of K+ in both cell types was abolished. Depletion of intracellular Ca++ stores with caffeine in Ca++-free medium abolished the response in circular muscle cells. Readdition of Ca++ to the medium for 30 sec restored the response in longitudinal but not circular muscle cells. [Ca++]i, measured in guinea pig muscle cells, increased 3- to 4-fold above resting levels (circular, 70.8 +/- 8.1 nM; longitudinal, 77.4 +/- 9.7 nM) in response to all three contractile agents. The increase in [Ca++]i induced by CCK-8 and acetylcholine in circular muscle cells was not affected by withdrawal of Ca++ from the medium or addition of methoxyverapamil, whereas the response to both agonists in longitudinal muscle cells and to 20 mM K+ in both cell types was abolished. It was concluded that cells from adjacent muscle layers of the intestine mobilize Ca++ differently during agonist-induced contraction, i.e., by Ca++ release in circular and Ca++ influx in longitudinal muscle cells.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that RBL-1 cells express membrane receptors for leukotriene (LT)D4 and that agonist stimulation of these receptors results in mobilization of intracellular calcium ([Ca++]i). We have used this LTD4 receptor-mediated event to examine the effects of homologous desensitization in RBL-1 cells. Prior exposure of RBL-1 cells to LTD4 resulted in a 40% reduction in the amount of maximal [Ca++]i mobilization. This desensitization was concentration- and time-dependent, with an EC50 of 1 to 3 nM and with 50% of the desensitization occurring after 7.5 min of pretreatment. SKF 104353 (100 nM), a high affinity, LTD4-receptor antagonist, blocked completely LTD4-induced desensitization of RBL-1 cells. The LTD4-induced desensitization was stereospecific, as the (5R,6S)-enantiomer of LTD4 was at least 100 times less potent than LTD4. Pretreatment of RBL-1 cells with LTD4 did not alter the ability of thrombin or ATP to induce [Ca++]i mobilization, suggesting that the desensitization was of the \"homologous\" type. The density of [3H]LTD4 receptors in RBL-1 cell membranes was decreased 23% by prior treatment of RBL-1 cells with LTD4. These results demonstrate that the [Ca++]i mobilization induced by LTD4 can be desensitized as a result of prior exposure to LTD4 and that the LTD4 receptor and/or second messenger systems can be specifically down-regulated.\r"

Daily i.p. injections, imipramine at 10 mg/kg or saline at 1 ml/kg b.w., were given during the 2 weeks before the deoxyglucose experiment. TX reduced glucose utilization in the limbic, motor, endocrine and auditory systems. Imipramine reduced glucose metabolism in the median eminence, both habenular nuclei and several limbic regions including the amygdala, hippocampus and parietal cortex. Five structures showed significant interactions between TX and imipramine. In three of these regions, the supraoptic nucleus, central amygdala and lateral habenula; TX and/or imipramine individually reduced metabolism and the combined treatment raised it back to within the normal range. In the dorsal raphe, TX and imipramine tended to increase metabolism and the combined treatment resulted in a decrease to within normal range. The neurohypophysis, unaffected by TX alone, showed a significant increase in activity when TX was combined with imipramine. These data indicate, in part, that both hypothyroidism and imipramine treatment alone depress metabolism in limbic forebrain and the major limbic-brainstem relay nuclei. Combined treatment normalizes metabolism in many of these limbic pathways. Hypothetically, hypothyroidism may alter central catecholamine function in such a way that the metabolic response to imipramine is reversed or altered.\r"

  ".U": "88155361\r", 
  ".W": "The possible role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in catecholamine secretion was studied by using bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. NPY produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of nicotine-stimulated norepinephrine and epinephrine release from bovine chromaffin cells with IC50 (concentration of NPY which inhibits 50% of maximum release of catecholamines) values of 1.8 x 10(-9) M and 1.7 x 10(-9) M, respectively. Catecholamine release induced by 56 mM KCl was not inhibited by NPY at these concentrations but was inhibited by high concentration (2 x 10(-6) M) of NPY. This inhibition was not affected by the concentration of nicotine used for catecholamine release or the presence of alpha, beta adrenergic and muscarinic antagonists. A structurally related peptide, human pancreatic polypeptide, showed a similar inhibitory effect on catecholamine release, but peptide YY or avian pancreatic polypeptide had little or no effect. N-propionyl[3H]NPY binds to a single class of saturable binding sites on bovine adrenal medulla membranes with a KD = 0.32 +/- 0.07 nM and Bmax = 63 +/- 16 fmol/mg of protein. The rank order of potency of NPY and other structurally similar peptides to displace N-propionyl[3H]NPY from binding is human pancreatic polypeptide greater than or equal to NPY much greater than peptide YY greater than avian pancreatic polypeptide, and is correlated with their potency to inhibit catecholamine release. These results suggest a modulatory role for NPY through a specific NPY receptor in the secretion of catecholamine from the adrenal.\r"

Phentolamine, a nonselective alpha adrenergic antagonist, relaxed rat aortic rings that were previously contracted with an EC80 dose of phenylephrine, in a concentration-dependent manner. Removal of the endothelium significantly reduced the sensitivity but not the amplitude of the response. The presence of endothelium also enhanced the vascular relaxation induced by yohimbine, a specific alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist (10(-8)-10(-6) M), and by prazosin, a specific alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (10(-11)-10(-9) M). Both methylene blue (10(-5) M), an inhibitor of soluble guanylate cyclase, and eicosatetraynoic acid (3.2 X 10(-5) M) blocked the endothelial augmentation of vascular relaxation to phentolamine. Vessels precontracted with potassium chloride were slightly relaxed by phentolamine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) only with the endothelium was intact. Both methylene blue and eicosatetraynoic acid also inhibited the response to phentolamine in the intact vessels precontracted with potassium chloride. Prazosin (10(-9)-10(-7) M) and yohimbine (10(-8)-10(-6) M), unlike phentolamine, failed to induce relaxation in potassium chloride-precontracted vessels. When the vessels were precontracted with the thromboxane analog U46619 none of the three alpha antagonists induced vascular relaxation. These results indicate that the endothelium has a significant role in promoting relaxation induced by the three alpha adrenergic antagonists tested.\r"

The derivatives were chosen to test the effects of the structural and physicochemical differences between lidocaine and procainamide on the kinetics of sodium channel block. Three derivatives were similar to lidocaine with a rapid onset of use-dependent block at fast stimulation rates and short time constants of recovery at normal resting potentials. Seven derivatives were similar to procainamide having slower rates of block development and longer recovery time constants. In order to quantify the differences in sodium channel block the data were analyzed by a model based on the modulated receptor hypothesis. This hypothesis proposes that each of the sodium channel states (rested, open and inactivated) has characteristic association and dissociation rate constants for each sodium channel blocker, drug bound channels do not conduct sodium and have altered inactivation kinetics. This model was solved for the dissociation constants of the drug for the rested and open states, the association and dissociation rate constants for the inactivated channels and the voltage shift of the inactivation kinetics for drug-bound channels. Quantitative structure-activity analysis on the derived parameters revealed that the affinity of the drugs for the open channel state is related to the compounds lipid solubility, the degree of voltage shift was proportional to molecular weight and the dissociation from the inactivated channels was correlated with both the molecular weight and charge.\r"

  ".W": "Morphine sulfate in doses of 90 to 150 micrograms/3 microliters evoke a prominent behavioral syndrome characterized by 1) periodic bouts of spontaneous agitation during which the rat scratches and bites at the skin of the caudal dermatomes and 2) vigorous agitation, vocalization and coordinated efforts to bite and escape evoked by a light tactile stimulus applied to the flank, suggestive of a pain state (allodynia). The phenomenon is not reversed by naltrexone or is it subject to tolerance. The ordering of activity of an opioid alkaloid related agent in producing this touch-evoked agitation is: noroxymorphone-3-glucuronide, morphine-3-glucuronide, morphine-3-ethereal sulfate, dihydromorphine, noroxymorphone dihydrate, hydromorphone, dihydrocodeine tartrate, morphine sulfate, dihydroisomorphine, morphine-HCl, 6-acetylmorphine, N-normorphine-HCl and (+)-morphine. The following agents were essentially without effect at the highest doses examined: 3,6-diacetylmorphine, N-normeperidine-HCl, nalorphine-HCl, alfentanil, sufentanil, naloxone, naltrexone, methadone, dextrorphan tartrate, meperidine-HCl, oxycodone, levorphanol, oxymorphone, codeine phosphate, thebaine, nalbuphine and naltrexone-3-glucuronide. The observations that the sulfated and conjugated metabolites are 10 to 50 times more potent than their unmetabolized precursor suggest the possibility that, in high concentrations certain phenanthrene opioid alkaloids with a free 3-OH position, an ether bridge and no N-methyl extension will be subject to conjugation and this metabolite will alter the processing of otherwise innocuous tactile stimuli. The fact that the phenomenon appeared at least partially stereospecific may reflect upon the fact that other laboratories have shown that glucuronyl transferase may preferentially convert (-)-morphine to the 3-glucuronide and (+)-morphine to the 6-glucuronide which may be less active.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

[3H]LTD4 binding to the enriched plasma membrane receptor was specific, stereoselective and saturable. LTE4 and high affinity receptor antagonists bound to the receptors with a rank-order potency that was expected from previous smooth muscle contraction studies. In the [3H]myoinositol labeled cells, LTD4 and LTE4 induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The biosynthesis of [3H]inositol-trisphosphate was rapid and the induction of biosynthesis of [3H]inositol-monophosphate by LTs was stereoselective and specific and was inhibited specifically by a receptor antagonist, SKF 104353. In the fura-2 loaded smooth muscle cells, LTD4 and LTE4 induced transient intracellular Ca++ mobilization. The fura-2/Ca++ transient was stereoselective and specific and was inhibited by receptor antagonist, SKF 104353. These results suggest that the cultured sheep tracheal smooth muscle cells have plasma membrane receptors for LTD4. These receptors were coupled to a phospholipase C that, when activated by agonists, induced hydrolysis of inositol containing phospholipids. The hydrolysis products, e.g. diacylglycerol and inositol-trisphosphate, may serve as intracellular messengers that trigger or contribute to the contractile effect in sheep tracheal smooth muscle.\r"

Both rimantadine and, to a lesser extent, amantadine were transported principally across the blood-brain barrier by a saturable transport system with a one-half saturation concentration of about 1.0 mM (either rimantadine or amantadine). The permeability surface area constants were 8.5 x 10(-2) sec-1 (rimantadine) and 1.1 x 10(-2) sec-1 (amantadine) with concentrations of less than 1.0 microM in the perfusate. The extraction of rimantadine and amantadine from the perfusate at low concentrations (less than 1.0 microM) was 88 and 26%, respectively, of the extraction of diazepam which is 100% extracted. Amantadine and rimantadine transport through the blood-brain barrier was significantly inhibited by weakly basic drugs (e.g., diphenhydramine) but not choline (10 mM), probenecid (1 mM) or leucine (1 mM). Inasmuch as both the pKa and percentage ionized at pH = 7.4 of rimantadine (10.4 and 99.9%, respectively) are much higher than that of amantadine (pKa = 9.0 and 97.5%, respectively), and inasmuch as rimantadine is transported into brain much more readily than amantadine, our results suggest that the carrier-mediated transport of the ionized moiety is the crucial process determining the penetration of amantadine and rimantadine through the blood-brain barrier.\r"

The following was found: 1) the increased saline infusion (saline) largely prevented an LPS-induced fall of inulin clearance and partially prevented a fall of blood pressure and p-aminohippurate and Cld clearance; 2) as a result, saline prevented slightly elevated late serum and cortical Cld concentrations in LPS-treated animals; 3) the tubular necrosis and elevation of serum creatinine caused by Cld alone was reduced slightly and that produced by the combination of LPS plus Cld was reduced greatly by saline; 4) the comparable mitochondrial respiratory toxicity found after Cld and LPS-plus-Cld was prevented by saline infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the presence of 10(-10) M VP, norepinephrine and the selective alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, B-HT 933, produced almost total inhibition of VP-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Half-maximal inhibition occurred at 1 x 10(-8) M and 6 x 10(-7) M for norepinephrine and B-HT 933, respectively. Cirazoline, a selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, had no significant effect on VP-stimulated cAMP accumulation. The inhibitory effects of norepinephrine and B-HT 933 were antagonized by rauwolscine but not by prazosin. The antagonism of B-HT 933-induced inhibition of VP-stimulated cAMP accumulation was competitive with an antagonist dissociation constant (KB) of 10.9 x 10(-9) M. Preincubation of papillary collecting ducts with pertussis toxin (1 microgram/ml for 1 hr at 37 degrees C) attenuated, by 65%, the inhibitory effect of B-HT 933 on VP-stimulated cAMP levels. These results demonstrate that alpha-2 adrenoceptors capable of inhibiting VP action are present on the papillary collecting duct. Furthermore, the alpha-2 adrenoceptor-induced inhibition of VP-stimulated cAMP accumulation is pertussis-toxin sensitive. This suggests that alpha-2 adrenoceptors are coupled negatively to adenylate cyclase, via the guanine nucleotide binding protein, in the collecting tubule.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated the relative contributions of Ca++ influx and C-kinase activation to the sustained contraction of smooth muscle of rabbit aorta. In physiological salt solution (PSS), the alpha adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PhE), induced a rapid initial contraction followed by a maintained tonic contraction whereas the C-kinase activator, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), caused only a slow tonic contractile response. Both PhE- and TPA-induced contractions were accompanied by a significant increase in the unidirectional 45Ca influx. The tonic phase of PhE contraction and the slow contractile response of TPA also were reduced, but not abolished completely in Ca++-free solution containing 2 mM ethylene glycol bis-(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N'-tetraacetic acid. In addition, the relatively specific C-kinase inhibitor, H-7 [1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine], reversibly inhibited the TPA-induced contraction in PSS and almost abolished the TPA response in Ca++-free solution. On the other hand, H-7 caused only partial inhibition (30.2% +/- 4.09, n = 5) of the PhE sustained contraction in PSS and abolished completely the residual PhE maintained response in Ca++-free solution. The H-7 inhibition of the PhE sustained contraction was reversible in both PSS and Ca++-free solution. Furthermore, TPA alone could not maintain the contractile response initiated by a high K+ depolarizing solution upon replacement of the high K+ solution by normal PSS. These findings emphasize the importance of Ca++ influx and suggest only a minor role of C-kinase in maintaining the tonic contraction of vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Synaptic excitability was assessed by measuring the effects of opioids on stimulus-response relationships and on the generation of afterpotentials as detected by extracellular recording. Opioids increased the excitability of both dentate granule and CA1 pyramidal cells in a naloxone-reversible manner. In the dentate gyrus, opioids changed the stimulus-response curve of the primary evoked response from a biphasic to a sigmoid shape and, in CA1, opioids shifted the sigmoid stimulus-response curve to the left without altering the maximal amplitude of the response. Multiple population spikes were evoked by orthodromic stimulation in the presence, but not the absence, of opioid agonists in both regions. Analysis of relative agonist potencies and antagonist sensitivities revealed mu, delta and kappa receptors in the dentate gyrus, but only mu and delta receptors in CA1. Mu-selective agonists had greater maximal effects than delta- or kappa-selective agonists in both regions. The effects of opioids on dentate granule cell excitability were similar to those of the gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonists bicuculline and pentylenetetrazole, thus opioids appear to act via a disinhibitory mechanism in the dentate gyrus as has been proposed in CA1. Our results suggest that endogenous opioid peptides may act by inhibiting interneurons, thereby disinhibiting dentate granule cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in OK cells, an opossum kidney-derived cell line. In membrane saturation binding experiments, [3H]rauwolscine (Kd = 74 pM) was 3-fold more potent than [3H]yohimbine (Kd = 230 pM). Each labeled a single class of binding sites with densities of 135 and 124 fmol/mg of protein for [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]yohimbine, respectively. Inhibition of [3H]rauwolscine and [3H]yohimbine binding by several alpha adrenergic agonists and antagonists demonstrated the radioligands labeled an alpha-2 type adrenergic receptor with a pharmacological profile similar to the alpha-2B receptor subtype. The rank order of potency for antagonist inhibition of binding was yohimbine greater than prazosin = phentolamine greater than chlorpromazine = corynanthine, whereas the rank order of agonist potency was oxymetazoline = clonidine greater than or equal to UK-14,304 greater than or equal to (-)-epinephrine greater than (-)-norepinephrine. The oxymetazoline, clonidine and antagonist inhibition curves were routinely monophasic and modeled best as a single class of binding sites. For the other agonists, inhibition binding curves were biphasic with approximately 35% of the binding sites existing in a high affinity state. These curves were shifted to the right in the presence of 0.1 mM GTP, and in general modeled as a single class of binding sites. UK-14,304, (-)-epinephrine, (-)-norepinephrine and oxymetazoline attenuated parathyroid hormone-stimulated cyclic AMP production by up to 70% in whole cell monolayers in a dose-dependent manner via a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. With the exception of oxymetazoline, this inhibition could be reversed with alpha adrenergic antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Aluminum is a neurotoxin capable of altering membrane structure and function. We investigated whether aluminum also can affect saturable transport across membranes using the blood-brain barrier as our model. Mice were given i.p. or i.v. aluminum (up to 100 mg/kg) as the chloride salt and the disappearance from the brain of several centrally administered substances was measured. We found that aluminum rapidly and profoundly inhibited the saturable system that transports the small, N-tyrosinated peptides Tyr-MIF-1 and the enkephalins from the brain to the blood by acting as a noncompetitive inhibitor. In contrast, the disappearance from the brain of technetium pertechnetate (a substance also transported out of the brain by a different saturable system), albumin or D-Tyr-MIF-1 (a stereoisomer of Tyr-MIF-1 that was confirmed not to be transported by the carrier system) was not affected by aluminum. Aluminum also did not alter either the saturable or nonsaturable component of the uptake of Tyr-MIF-1 by erythrocytes. These findings suggest that one mechanism by which aluminum may induce neurotoxicity is by selective alteration of the transport systems of the blood-brain barrier.\r"

In brain and other organs, cholinergic agents have been shown to produce their actions through the phosphoinositide (PI) second messenger system. To determine if cholinergic agents also produce activation of the PI messenger system in the kidney, we investigated the effects of carbachol (a stable analog of acetylcholine) on PI hydrolysis in the cortex, outer medulla and inner medulla of the rabbit kidney. PI hydrolysis was determined by measuring the formation of inositol phosphates in response to stimulation by carbachol in the presence of 8 mM lithium. Carbachol, 1 mM, was able to stimulate PI hydrolysis in the inner medulla and outer medulla (622 and 388% over control values, respectively), but not the cortex. The response to carbachol in the inner medulla was concentration-dependent (EC50 = 10(-5) M). The response was blocked by 1 microM atropine and not by 1 microM hexamethonium. The nicotinic agonist, 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium iodide did not stimulate PI hydrolysis. The effect of carbachol was dependent upon the presence of calcium ions. Substitution of alpha-ketoglutarate for glucose inhibited the response to carbachol in the inner medulla, suggesting a specific substrate requirement in PI metabolism. It is concluded that cholinergic agents produce stimulation of PI hydrolysis through muscarinic receptors in the inner medulla. Whether PI second messenger system in the kidney is involved in the diuretic effect of cholinergic agents remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "The imidazobenzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 has a high affinity for central benzodiazepine binding sites and has been shown to antagonize certain effects of ethanol. The purpose of the present study was to determine if Ro 15-4513 would attenuate the discriminative stimulus properties of ethanol and the other central nervous system depressants pentobarbital and oxazepam. Different groups of mice were trained to discriminate 1.0 or 1.5 g/kg of ethanol, 20 mg/kg of pentobarbital or 10 mg/kg of oxazepam from saline injections in a two-lever operant task. Stimulus generalization tests were conducted with Ro 15-4513 alone (0.01-20 mg/kg) and in combination with the training drugs. The discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol and oxazepam, but not of pentobarbital, were blocked by Ro 15-4513. When given alone in each of the different drug-training groups, Ro 15-4513 did not produce drug-lever responding but decreased overall response rates in a dose-related fashion. Although the alcohols, barbiturates and benzodiazepines share discriminative stimulus properties under many conditions, the selective blockade of their stimulus effects provides further evidence that their actions may be mediated by different cellular mechanisms. These data also show that Ro 15-4513 may attenuate behavioral effects of ethanol relevant to its abuse.\r"

A single injection of 10.0 or 32.0 mg/kg of morphine 24 hr before naltrexone produced 3- and 10-fold decreases, respectively, in the dose of naltrexone required for complete generalization. When morphine (10.0-100.0 mg/kg) was administered 48 hr before naltrexone, pigeons were not more sensitive to naltrexone as a discriminative stimulus but continued to be more sensitive to the rate-decreasing effects of naltrexone. Conditions that produced the largest increase in sensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects of naltrexone (32.0 mg/kg of morphine 24 hr before the session) also increased sensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects and rate-decreasing effects of naloxone, but did not affect the discriminative stimulus effects of diprenorphine, nalorphine or morphine. Increases in sensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects of naltrexone and naloxone after single injections of morphine approached in magnitude the increases reported previously in pigeons treated chronically (once/daily) with large doses of morphine. However, the lack of generalization to naltrexone after pretreatment with still larger doses of morphine, as well as the failure of nalorphine and diprenorphine to substitute for naltrexone as discriminative stimuli under conditions in which sensitivity to naltrexone was increased, support the view that naltrexone does not produce its discriminative stimulus effects in nondependent animals exclusively through an opioid antagonistic action. The results suggest that morphine induced, acute supersensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects of naltrexone differs from the supersensitivity to antagonists observed during chronic morphine treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

(+)-Alpha-cyclazocine and both (+)- and (-)-beta-cyclazocine substituted for PCP. Neither (+/-) nor (-)-alpha-cyclazocine substituted for PCP, although both compounds had potent, response-rate decreasing effects. When these two drugs were tested in combination with naltrexone, rate-suppressing effects were somewhat attenuated and both then resulted in substantial PCP-lever responding. Thus, PCP-like effects in the alpha series can be masked by opiate effects. (-)-Beta-cyclazocine was the most potent compound for mimicking the PCP discriminative stimulus, being 4 to 5 times more potent than PCP itself. The (+)-isomers in both the alpha and beta series were equipotent and over 10 times less potent than PCP. Thus, both stereoisomers of beta-cyclazocine have PCP-like discriminative stimulus properties and the (-)-isomer, in particular, is a very potent, selective, PCP-like compound. The stereoisomers of beta-cyclazocine have over a 50-fold potency difference for PCP-like effects, evidencing greater stereoselectivity for these actions than is commonly obtained with 6,7-benzomorphans. The stereoisomers of beta-cyclazocine should prove to be useful tools for studying the PCP/sigma-like effects of opioids.\r"

Administration of PGE1 (100 ng/kg/min into the left atrium) to dogs beginning 10 min after left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) occlusion and continuing up to 2 hr of reperfusion resulted in a 43% reduction in infarct size expressed as a percentage of the area at risk: control infarct, 44.3 +/- 3.2%, n = 15; PGE1, 27.3 +/- 3.2%, n = 19, P less than .0005. Regional myocardial blood flow (measured with tracer-labeled microspheres in six dogs from each group) was similar between treatment groups at base line, 5 min after LCCA occlusion, 80 min after LCCA occlusion and 1 hr after LCCA reperfusion. In another group of anesthetized dogs, PGE1 was tested for its ability to decrease neutrophil migration into skin lesions. PGE1 at the same concentration that reduced infarct size, decreased the number of neutrophils (assessed by myeloperoxidase activity) that accumulated in skin lesions after intradermal injection of C5a by 63%. In addition, PGE1 inhibited the production of superoxide anion in vitro by zymosan-stimulated canine neutrophils in a concentration-dependent manner. Thus, PGE1 reduces myocardial infarct size and inhibits neutrophil function in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the reduction in infarct size by PGE1 may be due to multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of neutrophil migration and activation at the site of tissue injury or 2) reduction in blood pressure which reduces myocardial oxygen demand.\r"

Approximately 62% of the total muscarinic binding sites in human peripheral lung bind [3H]PZ with high affinity. There was no significant effect of the guanine nucleotide, guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate, on the inhibition of [3H](-)-quinyclidinyl benzilate binding by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in peripheral lung membranes. If the muscarinic receptor with high affinity for PZ has an important role in bronchoconstriction, its characterization could result in the development of more selective bronchodilators.\r"

The principal mechanism of anemia and thrombocytopenia is impaired hematopoiesis. Despite pancytopenia in the peripheral blood, bone marrow cellularity and morphology remained normal. Upon replacement of D2O with tap water, platelet and neutrophil concentrations returned to normal within 48 to 72 hr. In contrast, blood lymphocyte concentrations remained low for several weeks. B-lymphocytes may be more affected by deuteration than other lymphocyte subsets. In vivo reticuloendothelial cell function, as assessed by 51Cr-labeled sheep erythrocyte clearance, was unaffected by D2O. Although a dose-dependent decrease in fluid intake occurred during deuteration, hematocytopenia was not a consequence of dehydration. In view of the known kinetics of D2O in biological systems, the rapid response of myeloid elements to deuteration must be due primarily to the solvent (nonmetabolic) isotope effect. Prolonged deuteration has proven toxic when included in regimens for treatment of neoplasia, including leukemia, in animal models. The present study shows that modulation of hematopoiesis by D2O is possible without invoking the toxicities associated with prolonged deuteration.\r"

  ".W": "Systemic administration of morphine in rats produces an anti-natriuretic effect that is at least partially dependent on renal nerves. The present studies were carried out in order to assess the renal response to central administration of morphine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically prepared with arterial, venous and bladder cannulas. In addition, a guide cannula was placed into the lateral ventrical and secured to the surface of the skull. Experiments were carried out at least 3 days after surgery. Renal clearance measurements were 30 min each. After a basal period, morphine sulfate (4 micrograms/4 microliters) or vehicle was injected into the lateral cerebral ventricle. Two clearance measurements were obtained, followed by central administration of naloxone HCl (4 micrograms/4 microliters) or vehicle and two more clearance periods. Morphine administration had no effect on blood pressure or heart rate but caused a sharp reduction in sodium excretion (3200 +/- 958 vs 970 +/- 158 nEq/100 g/min in period 5; P less than .05). This response was reversed by the addition of naloxone (3280 +/- 583 nEq/100 g/min in period 5; P less than .05). Furthermore, morphine had no effect on renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Naloxone increased the renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate in morphine-treated rats, whereas it had no effect in controls. It is concluded that central administration of morphine in conscious rats enhances renal tubular sodium reabsorption by an opiate receptor-dependent mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of antidepressant drugs, administered with and without a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) antagonist that is not selective for 5-HT receptor subtypes, were assessed in rats responding under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-second (DRL 72-s) schedule of reinforcement. The increases in reinforcement rate seen after low dose tricyclic antidepressant drug administration were antagonized by the 5-HT antagonist methysergide. Methysergide did not antagonize either the increases in reinforcement rate or the decreases in response rate induced by the atypical antidepressant trazodone or the putative antidepressant clenbuterol. In addition, the effects of 5-HT receptor antagonists with varying selectivity for the 5-HT2 relative to the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes were assessed when administered alone. The rank order potency series for the maximal increase in the reinforcement rate after administration of the 5-HT antagonists was ketanserin greater than pipamperone greater than trazodone greater than cyproheptadine greater than cinanserin greater than metergoline greater than methysergide, in close agreement with the selectivity of these drugs for the 5-HT2 relative to the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. In addition, the specificity of the DRL 72-s schedule was further assessed with the alpha adrenergic antagonists phentolamine and phenoxybenzamine which both decreased the response rate but did not increase the reinforcement rate as do antidepressant drugs. These results suggest that the therapeutic effect of atypical antidepressants such as trazodone and mianserin may be related to selective antagonism of 5-HT2 receptors. Furthermore, agonist action at a 5-HT1 receptor and antagonist action at 5-HT2 receptors both appear to contribute to antidepressant-like activity on the DRL 72-s schedule.\r"

The epithelium was stripped from one-half of each trachea by mechanical means, and immunologic responses were evaluated by paired analysis. Removing the epithelium potentiated antigen-induced contraction, as reflected by a 5-fold leftward shift in the antigen dose-response curve, but the maximum response to antigen was not altered. This potentiation was not inhibited by pretreating the tissues with indomethacin (5 X 10(-6) M). At maximum concentrations of antigen removing the epithelium had no effect on the magnitude or kinetics of release of immunoreactive sulfidopeptide leukotrienes, prostaglandin (PG) D2, PGF2 alpha or thromboxane B2. Removing the epithelium did, however, significantly decrease the release of PGE and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, a prostacyclin metabolite. Antigen-induced histamine release was enhanced by removing the epithelium; this effect varied inversely with antigen concentration. Selectively exposing either the luminal or serosal surface of an intact, superfused trachea to antigen resulted in the release of less than 5% of the total tissue histamine. Removing the epithelium from the intact trachea increased histamine release to approximately 25% following luminal but not serosal exposure to antigen. These studies demonstrate that the tracheal epithelium can act to inhibit antigen-induced airway contraction in vitro. This may in part reflect the role of the intact epithelium as a diffusion barrier which can limit the rate of influx of antigen molecules and thereby influence tissue mast cell activation.\r"

The objectives were to determine the systemic pharmacokinetics, urinary and biliary excretion and degree of enterohepatic circulation (EHC) of these compounds. Trial conditions were: A: EHC intact, with blood and urine, but not bile, collected after i.v. drug administration; B: EHC interrupted, with blood, urine and bile collected after i.v. drug administration; and C: bile infused, EHC open, without i.v. drug administration, with bile collected from trial B (containing biliary excreted drug) infused into the duodenum via the T-tube, followed by collection of blood, urine and bile. At least 2 weeks elapsed between trials. Interruption of the EHC caused lorazepam plasma half-life to shorten (3.4 vs. 2.3 hr with the EHC intact, P less than .1), clearance to increase (9.2 vs. 12.3 ml/min/kg, P less than .1) and total area under the plasma concentration curve for lorazepam glucuronide to decrease (210 vs. 310 ng/ml X hr, P less than .06). Recovery of lorazepam as its glucuronide in bile was 24.5% of the i.v. injected dose. Urinary elimination of lorazepam glucuronide was reduced from 41 to 36% of the dose due to bile collection. Subsequent duodenal infusion of collected bile, containing an average of 2.45 mg of lorazepam as glucuronide, was followed by urinary excretion of 0.48 mg of lorazepam as glucuronide in urine and 0.36 mg re-excreted into bile.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We examined the effect of the muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 (4-m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy-2-butynyl trimethyl ammonium) on in vitro preparations of rat small intestine. McN-A-343 (0.1-10 microM) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of duodenum, jejunum and ileum. This effect was due to activation of muscarinic receptors of the M1 subtype, inasmuch as it was antagonized by atropine (pA2, 8.93) and by the selective M1 antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine with high affinity (pA2, 8.09 and 8.14, respectively). Tetrodotoxin, but not hexamethonium, abolished McN-A-343 relaxation indicating involvement of neural pathways and absence of nicotinic transmission. Moreover, in the presence of apamin (0.1 microM) McN-A-343 induced a contractile response. Unlike McN-A-343, acetylcholine contracted the rat duodenum; its concentration-response curve was significantly potentiated by tetrodotoxin, suggesting stimulation of the McN-A-343 sensitive receptor by acetylcholine (P less than .01). Prior treatment of animals with reserpine reduced the potency of McN-A-343 only by 2.5-fold. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist bicuculline inhibited McN-A-343 with an affinity comparable to that found for GABA(A) receptors (pA2, 5.52), indicating involvement of GABAergic fibers. ATP is also likely to play a role, as desensitization experiments showed that alpha-beta-methylene ATP induced a comparable decrease of both McN-A-343 and its own response. In contrast, desensitization induced by GABA occurred to a minor extent. Thus, in the rat duodenum, activation of an M1 muscarinic receptor induces relaxation by releasing GABA, and possibly ATP, from myenteric neurons.\r"

  ".W": "Comparative studies of the benzisoxazole derivative risperidone (R 64 766) were made with ritanserin, a selective centrally acting serotonin-S2 antagonist and with haloperidol, a selective centrally acting dopamine-D2 antagonist. Risperidone like ritanserin shows activity in all tests related to serotonin-S2 antagonism, but at even lower doses (peripheral S2-antagonism at 0.0011 mg/kg, central S2-antagonism at 0.014 mg/kg). Like haloperidol, risperidone shows activity in all tests related to dopamine-D2 antagonism; activity in rats for both compounds starts at 0.016 mg/kg, but some central nervous system controlled functions, including the induction of catalepsy, are relatively much less affected by risperidone. Qualitatively, risperidone is a mixed serotonin-dopamine antagonist. Quantitatively, its study in dogs reveals potent dopamine-D2 antagonistic activity with excellent p.o. bioavailability and a relatively long duration of action. From the obtained pharmacological data, risperidone could be expected to possess the complementary clinical effects of a ritanserin-like serotonin-S2 and an haloperidol-like dopamine-D2 antagonist. Serotonin-S2 antagonism may improve the quality of sleep, reduce negative and affective symptoms in schizophrenic patients and decrease extrapyramidal symptoms induced by classical neuroleptics. Because risperidone is a dopamine-D2 antagonist, antidelusional, antihallucinatory and antimanic actions are expected. The first clinical studies indicate that two additional therapeutic targets, which are not reached with classical neuroleptics, may be obtained with risperidone in the monotherapy of schizophrenia and related disorders: very important contact and mood-elevating properties and extrapyramidal symptoms-free maintenance therapy.\r"

Two groups of remnant kidney rats, one fed a standard protein diet and one a low protein diet, heavy proteinuric rats (adriamycin) and diabetic rats, each with their own control group, were treated with increasing doses of gentamicin, given as a continuous infusion over 6 hr. The relationship between increasing steady-state serum levels (ranged from 1 to 100 micrograms/ml) and the cortical gentamicin concentrations at the end of the infusions was examined by means of Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The uptake curves were compared to their respective control curves. It was demonstrated that gentamicin uptake was reduced in remnant kidney rats fed standard diet (showing hyperfiltration and heavy proteinuria), in adriamycin rats (showing heavy proteinuria in the absence of hyperfiltration) and in diabetic rats. Uptake of gentamicin in remnant kidney rats fed low protein diet (showing hyperfiltration and slight proteinuria) was comparable to controls. It appeared that among the pathophysiological factors examined, proteinuria is the most important in decreasing the cortical uptake of gentamicin. It is suggested that high levels of proteins in the proximal tubular fluid interfere with the adsorptive endocytic process, involved in the uptake of both proteins and gentamicin.\r"

  ".W": "We found four new phenylcarbamoyl-substituted 1,4-dihydropyridines which produced vasoconstrictor and vasopressor effects and we further investigated the mode of vasoconstrictor action of one of the derivatives, 2-(2-pyridil)ethyl-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2,6-dimethyl-5-phenylcarbamo yl-1, 4-dihydropyridine-3-carboxylate (YC-170). In anesthetized dogs. YC-170 (0.1-3 mg/kg i.v.) produced dose-dependent increases in blood pressure, total peripheral resistance and maximum dLVP/dt with slight reductions of heart rate and aortic blood flow. Intracoronary injection of YC-170 (10-1000 micrograms) produced not only a decrease in coronary blood flow but also an immediate reversal of the coronary vasodilation induced by nicardipine (3 micrograms). YC-170 (0.1-3 mg/kg i.v.) also produced a dose-dependent and reversible vasopressor effect in both anesthetized and pithed rats. The vasopressor response to YC-170 in pithed rats was not attenuated by either hexamethonium, prazosin, yohimbine, ketanserin or reserpine but was antagonized by either nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil or diltiazem. In isolated rabbit aorta, YC-170 (3 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-5) M) induced a dose-dependent and reversible contraction which was not affected by either phentolamine, prazosin, mepyramine, ketanserin or atropine but removed by either nicardipine, verapamil or a Ca++-free medium. YC-170 (1 X 10(-6) to 3 X 10(-5) M) displaced [3H]nitrendipine binding to the canine cardiac membrane in an apparently competitive manner with a Ki value of 1.7 X 10(-6) M. The results suggest that the new phenylcarbamoyl-substituted dihydropyridines, including YC-170, exert a direct vasoconstrictor effect, which appears to be associated with an influx of Ca++ through Ca++ channels.\r"

The high potency and the low solubility in cellular membranes of this compound led us to prepare [3H]52770 RP. This ligand was characterized by a binding which was rapid, reversible, confined to a single site, saturable, specific and stereoselective. Its Kd and Bmax were 4.2 +/- 0.3 nM and 181 +/- 11 fmol/2.5 X 10(6) PMNs, respectively. The stereoselectivity of the binding was suggested by the 600- and 1050-fold higher potency of the d-enantiomer with respect to l-52770 RP in displacing [3H]52770 RP or [3H]PAF, respectively. Several PAF analogs (e.g., lyso-PAF, 2-O-methyl-lyso-PAF), which are poorly active as PAF receptor agonists in functional tests, were weak displacers of [3H]PAF and [3H]52770 RP. Furthermore, for a series of 14 known PAF receptor agonists or antagonists belonging to different chemical families, there was an excellent correlation (r = 0.98) between their ability to displace [3H]PAF and [3H]52770 RP. Thus, [3H]52770 RP and [3H]PAF appear to interact with the same binding site on human PMNs which is proposed to be the PAF receptor mediating functional responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Maximum relaxations to isoproterenol (ISO), fenoterol and norepinephrine were less in hypertensive than in normotensive tissues. Mean negative log EC50 values of ISO and norepinephrine, but not fenoterol, were smaller in femoral and mesenteric strips from hypertensive rats than those from oil-water-treated rats. In thoracic aortas from hypertensive rats, the mean negative log EC50 values of ISO and fenoterol decreased, whereas those of norepinephrine increased as compared with those in oil-water-treated rats. In oil-salt- and deoxycorticosterone-water-treated rats, hypertension did not develop nor were the responses to ISO reduced. Relative potencies of the beta adrenoceptor agonists and Schild plot data for atenolol and butoxamine indicate that femoral arteries of normotensive and hypertensive rats possess beta-1 adrenoceptors mediating relaxation. It also is suggested that the mesenteric artery and thoracic aorta of both normotensive and hypertensive rats predominantly possess beta-2 adrenoceptors mediating relaxation. The present results suggest that an elevation in blood pressure is associated with the reduction of beta-1 adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in femoral arteries and of beta-2 adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation in mesenteric arteries.\r"

We have previously demonstrated dose-related covalent binding and toxicity of reactive intermediates of sulfonamides generated by a murine hepatic microsomal activating system. We hypothesized that hydroxylamine (H/A) metabolites might be likely candidates for mediating such toxicity; accordingly, we synthesized chemically the H/As of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole. Synthesis was performed using 4-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride and either 2-aminopyrimidine or 3-amino-5-methylisoxazole, respectively, as starting materials. The resulting nitro derivatives were reduced to the corresponding H/A with hydrogen in the presence of a poisoned platinum catalyst. After synthesis and purification, toxicity of the H/As to lymphocytes of normal volunteers was evaluated using three cytotoxicity assays: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide dye conversion, trypan blue dye exclusion and propidium iodide dye exclusion. The H/As of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole displayed dose-related toxicity. 1.6 mM sulfadiazine H/A produced 82% cell death, whereas 400 microM sulfamethoxazole H/A produced 62% cell death; the parent sulfonamides were not toxic to cells. The toxicity of sulfamethoxazole H/A was decreased by coincubation with glutathione or N-acetylcysteine; there was a 47% decrease in toxicity when coincubated with 100 microM glutathione, whereas there was a 55% decrease displayed when coincubation was done with 500 microM N-acetylcysteine. H/A metabolites of the sulfonamides or their nitroso derivatives, normally detoxified by conjugation to glutathione, may be the proximate toxins mediating sulfonamide hypersensitivity.\r"

Evaluation of angiogenesis was performed by placing a thin plastic coverslip inscribed with concentric circles on the CAM and counting the number of vessels intercepting the circles. The rate of BM collagen biosynthesis was monitored using [U-14C] proline incorporation into CAM proteins and determining the collagenase-digestible protein fraction. A marked depression in the vascular density was observed in the CAM area under a plastic disc containing GPA1734 as compared to control discs placed on the CAM about 1 cm apart from days 9 to 12 of incubation. A concomitant decrease in collagenous protein biosynthesis was observed in the area under the discs containing GPA1734 and [U-14C]proline as compared to control discs containing only the radiolabeled proline. The forementioned effects of GPA1734 on CAM were specific because no similar effects were observed with a closely related compound, 9,10-dihydroxy-7-methyl-benzo[b]quinolizinium bromide or with GPA1734 plus Fe++, which did not affect the rate of BM collagen biosynthesis. These results suggest that inhibitors of BM collagen biosynthesis prevent angiogenesis by interfering with the formation of an essential component of the vessel wall. The search for such inhibitors may be a new approach in the development of antiangiogenic agents.\r"

Ranitidine is thought to spare phase I hepatic metabolism mediated by cytochrome P-450, unlike its counterpart H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine. The aim of the present study was to determine, in eight human subjects, the effect of ranitidine on the disposition of the potassium-sparing diuretic triamterene, which undergoes renal tubular secretion, hepatic hydroxylation and subsequent sulphate conjugation to a pharmacologically active metabolite. Multiple blood and urine samples were collected throughout a dosing interval after chronic administration of triamterene alone, ranitidine alone or the two in combination. Ranitidine significantly (P less than .05) reduced the renal clearances of triamterene (51%) and p-hydroxytriamterene sulphate conjugate (47%), the clearance by hydroxylation of triamterene (30%) and the apparent absorption of triamterene (52%). In turn, triamterene reduced the renal clearance of ranitidine (14%). The interaction resulted in a small attenuation of the pharmacodynamic response to triamterene. These results necessitate consideration of the underlying mechanisms of the interactions and fall outside of our present understanding of the renal clearance of sulphate conjugates and the metabolic inhibitory effects of ranitidine. Competition for translocation across membranes is postulated as a common mechanism for the observed renal and hepatic interactions.\r"

The brain-, salivary gland- and liver extraction of [3H] cyclosporine relative to [14C]butanol were studied with an intracarotid and a portal vein injection technique; the kidney extraction of [3H]cyclosporin relative to p[14C]aminohippuric acid was measured after a rapid injection in the aorta. The injection vehicles were a Ringer's solution [Ringer-4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid], rat plasma, human plasma, human red blood cells (RBC) suspension and human blood. The brain extraction (1-4%), the salivary extraction (25-74%) and the kidney extraction (8-47%) varied markedly depending on which blood components were added to the injection solution. The effect of RBC binding on tissue extraction was by far more pronounced than that of plasma protein binding. The binding of cyclosporin to RBC retards particularly the uptake of this drug by kidney. Moreover the kidney penetration of cyclosporin was confirmed by thaw-mount autoradiography after injection of the labeled drug in the aorta; the micrographs showed that the renal clearance of cyclosporin was restricted largely to the glomerular route. In contrast the hepatic extraction of [3H]cyclosporin was high (48-84%) and generally nonlimited by its binding to blood components; this could explain the high concentrations of drug observed in this tissue. In summary, cyclosporin binding to RBC and plasma proteins reduces drug uptake by brain, kidney and salivary gland, but causes little inhibition of hepatic uptake of cyclosporin.\r"

  ".W": "Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity represents an example of a life-threatening adverse drug reaction. Our study examined 10 subjects with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and determined that cells obtained by BAL demonstrated marked increases in various phospholipids compared to control subjects (n = 7). Bis monoacylglycerol phosphate and phosphatidylglycerol were significantly increased in both relative and absolute amounts (P less than .01). Several other phospholipids also were significantly increased in absolute amounts within the cell fraction. In contrast, the cell-free BAL fluid revealed only minor differences in phospholipid content. There was a strong direct correlation between concentration of amiodarone and its primary metabolite, desethylamiodarone in BAL cells (r = 0.98), and also a direct correlation between either the concentration of amiodarone or desethylamiodarone and the accumulation of phospholipids in the cells (r = 0.97, both determinations). This study indicates that findings from BAL in human subjects may provide specific and quantifiable evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis, and suggests the concentration of the drug or its primary metabolite in BAL cells is a major determinant for the degree of phospholipid accumulation in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of quinidine (0.01-20 micrograms/ml) on spontaneous action potentials and membrane current systems of the rabbit atrioventricular node were studied. At therapeutic concentrations, this drug decreased the action potential amplitude, the maximal diastolic potential, the threshold potential as well as the maximal rate of depolarization and showed a negative chronotropic action. Quinidine, at 5 micrograms/ml, decreased the peak slow inward current by 30.2%, increased its time constant of inactivation by 27.3%, shifted the steady-state inactivation curve toward more negative membrane potentials by 2.8 mV and decreased its fully activated current. Quinidine exerted not only resting but also use-dependent blocking actions on the slow inward current. The depression of the action potential upstroke can thus be explained by the reduction in this current. The outward K+ tail current was decreased by 65.4% and its deactivation time constant was increased by 19.0%. These effects may have contributed to the prolongation of the action potential duration, the reduction in the maximal diastolic potential and the slowing of diastolic depolarization. Quinidine shifted the steady-state activation curve for this K+ current toward hyperpolarization by as much as 7.8 mV. It decreased the hyperpolarization-activated inward current by 16.3% and increased its activation time constant by 10.1%, but this current appeared to play a small role in reducing the rate of diastolic depolarization. These observations indicate that, depending upon dose, quinidine has the potential to decrease all of the time- and voltage-dependent ionic currents in atrioventricular nodal cells.\r"

However, although the medical records mentioned hypertension in 43 percent and diabetes in 12 percent of the patients 65 or over, dementia and incontinence were recorded in only 0.4 percent and 2 percent, respectively. This finding suggests either that these elderly patients were extremely atypical or that their geriatric problems were unrecognized.\r"

Contrary to the investigators' expectations, there was no significant association among high stress, social phobia, and choice of least stressful specialties. Certain students who indicated that stress was unfavorable nevertheless chose high-stress specialties. Implications of these findings are discussed, and the findings are compared with outcomes of related studies.\r"

The goal of the program was to help impaired house staff members to continue their training in a nonpunitive environment. An approach to reviewing allegations of impairment and a legal agreement between the hospital and the recovering resident were implemented. Because no residents were reported for impairment during its first two years, the program's emphasis was shifted from an investigative to an educational, assistive role. Major problems in carrying out the program have been the program's lack of authority to ensure cooperation by program directors and by impaired residents; a widespread unfamiliarity with intervention procedures despite efforts to inform residents, their spouses, faculty members, and administrators about the program; and misconceptions that the program is punitive. Further impediments are lack of a budget to provide educational activities, inadequate socializing between the faculty and the house staff that would enable faculty members to recognize early signs of impairment; and inadequate health insurance coverage for long-term treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The type I interferons [both partially purified human leukocyte interferon (HuIFN-alpha) and recombinant alpha interferon] and the type II interferons have been shown to increase the expression of tumor-associated antigens in vitro. To determine whether HuIFN-alpha could increase tumor acquisition of the antimelanoma antibody 96.5 in vivo, five patients with metastatic malignant melanoma were treated with HuIFN-alpha at a dose of 3 X 10(6) units daily by im administration. Twenty-four hours after the first dose of HuIFN-alpha, 1 mg of antibody 96.5 labeled with 5 mCi of 111In was coadministered with 19 mg of unlabeled 96.5. Five patients matched for metastatic site and lesion size who had not received HuIFN-alpha were also given a dose of 5 mCi of radiolabeled 96.5 at the same total antibody dose (20 mg). In patients treated with HuIFN-alpha, there was a statistically significant increase in the plasma half-life of the 111In label (39.7 +/- 3.3 hr) compared to the untreated control group (29.8 +/- 3.2 hr). In addition, there was an increase in the apparent volume of distribution of the antibody in the HuIFN-alpha group (5.56 +/- 0.67 L) compared to controls (3.15 +/- 0.5 L) suggesting both an increased immediate extravascular distribution of radiolabeled antibody and a decrease in the subsequent rate of clearance of antibody from plasma. These two phenomena result in a 28% decrease in the area under the concentration curve in the HuIFN-alpha-treated group compared to controls. Computer analysis of whole-body scans from patients showed a threefold increase in radiolabeled antibody distributed to tumor relative to blood pool but no change in organ:blood ratios for liver, spleen, bone, or kidney compared to controls. This pilot study suggests that treatment of patients with HuIFN-alpha results in an improved distribution of radiolabeled antibody to tumor target without a concomitant increase of label in normal nontarget tissues. In addition, this change in whole-body distribution of antibody is manifested by changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters measured for monoclonal antibody.\r"

  ".W": "The contribution of lipid peroxidation to the killing of human breast cancer cells by gamma-linolenate (GLA) was examined. Other fatty acids of different cytotoxic potential containing 2, 4, 5, and 6 double bonds were also tested for comparison. It was found that the cytotoxic potential varied with the ability of the fatty acids to stimulate the production of superoxide radicals. Neither hydrogen peroxide nor hydroxy radicals are significantly involved in cell killing. As nonspecific indicators of lipid peroxidation, measurements of the loss of unsaturated fatty acid in the phospholipids together with the generation of hydroperoxide breakdown products were done with the use of the thiobarbituric acid test. The results of these experiments showed that the effectiveness of a given fatty acid in killing cancer cells correlated with the intracellular thiobarbituric acid-reactive material (TBARM) content: GLA and arachidonate with 3 and 4 double bonds generated the most TBARM and were the most cytotoxic fatty acids, whereas docosahexaenoate with 6 double bonds was the least effective either in raising TBARM or in killing the malignant cells. Iron and copper accelerated the rate of cell death, whereas antioxidants such as vitamin E and butylated hydroxyanisole inhibited the effect of GLA dose dependently. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of endoperoxide formation, did not reduce either cell kill or TBARM amounts. In contrast, the addition of vitamin E acetate to the cancer cell cultures challenged with eicosapentaenoate reduced both cell killing and TBARM content. These results suggest that the effectiveness of a given fatty acid in killing cancer cells correlated with the extent of lipid peroxidation of the added fatty acid in the cells.\r"

This series is the one from which the analogue N,5-dimethyl-9-[(2-methoxysulfonylamino)phenylamino]-4-acridinecarboxamide (CI-921), presently in clinical trial, was chosen. The analogues also were tested in vitro by comparing growth inhibition data [IC50 values (concentration required to reduce growth of cultured cells to 50% of that of untreated cultures)], using L1210 murine leukemia cells and HCT-8 human colon carcinoma cells. Determined IC50 values were highly dependent on the culture medium used, and it was found that the presence of ascorbate in the medium had a major effect on the stability of compounds to oxidation. A survey of 115 analogues of amsacrine indicates that a low ratio of IC50 values (HCT-8/L1210) is necessary but not sufficient for good antitumor activity against the solid tumor. DNA binding constants did not in themselves predict activity, although they were related to dose potency. Other factors, such as drug lipophilicity, acridine base strength, and drug solubility, also are involved, probably in providing effective drug distribution. It is concluded that in vitro assay data provide information useful for drug design but that other factors also are important for in vivo activity.\r"

Peak carboxyhemoglobin levels averaged 37% during a mean exposure time of 33 minutes. All animals survived the 24-hour study period, and showed only transient abnormalities in lung fluid balance and gas exchange, with no change in lung mechanics or plasma eicosanoid (TxB2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) levels. However, extravascular lung water at 24 hours was increased 33%, suggesting the presence of some airway edema and retained secretions. We feel this model fairly represents the majority of clinical smoke inhalation cases. This model is compared to other large animal inhalation injury models producing more severe lung injury.\r"

Eight of 12 patients with \"lethal\" CN levels (greater than 1.0 mg/L) died. All had sublethal levels of COHb. A separate group of patients who were DOA following fatal burn injuries were also studied. Lethal CN levels were found in 12 of 14 victims with lethal COHb levels and in 14 of 20 victims with sublethal COHb levels. The results show that elevated CN levels are frequent in patients with smoke inhalation and suggest that cyanide toxicity is a contributor to severe inhalation injuries. In some cases, CN was the primary measured toxicant.\r"

Profound depression of cell-mediated immune response (CMIR) is a characteristic effect of burn injury, and was evaluated using the popliteal lymph node assay for graft-versus-host and host-versus-graft responsiveness in mice. Preservation of CMIR after burn injury was observed in animals treated with 40 mg/kg ibuprofen and in mice given anti-PGE antibody. It appears that PGE is a central immunoregulatory mediator of suppressed CMIR following thermal injury and that treatment resulting in inhibition of PGE production or neutralization of PGE with anti-PGE antibody prevented burn-induced immunosuppression.\r"

The CAK grafts were placed on surgically excised wounds rather than mature granulation tissue. This technique guaranteed that permanent skin coverage derived from cultured cells, and not residual epidermal cells from surviving dermis. Graft take was variable, ranging from zero in the case of one of the children to 85%. Long-term assessment noted adequate permanent coverage, confirmed by biopsy. Electron micrographs demonstrated no well formed anchoring fibrils, which may account for the graft fragility which has been reported as much as 1 year postgraft. Advantages of using CAK are that an acceptable permanent wound closure can be achieved without depending on donor site availability. An almost unlimited quantity of skin is available because the original biopsy can be expanded manyfold in the laboratory.\r"

The precise mechanisms involved in the induction of protease release has not been determined. We show here that sera from burn patients with greater than 40% TBSA have significantly elevated levels of active elastase which correspond with significantly increased levels of suppressor active peptide (SAP) and suppression of neutrophil chemotaxis. The elastase inhibitory capacity of serum from burned or blunt trauma patients was within normal range, suggesting that the primary elastase inhibitor, alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, is functionally active. Additionally, granulocytes exposed to suppressor active peptide in vitro resulted in a markedly elevated release of elastase into the culture supernatants. These data suggest that the suppressor peptide is capable of not only suppressing immune function but is also a potent mediator for the induction of proteolytic enzyme release from leukocytes.\r"

None with PE were ICU patients and none had lower-extremity IV lines. Two patients had embolic events after discharge from the hospital. No ICU patients who died unexpectedly had a PE. Only two patients had significant risk factors; they were obese with leg burns. Three had no risk factors; normal weight and upper body burns without prolonged bed rest. The incidence of pulmonary emboli and resulting morbidity do not justify routine prophylactic heparinization of all burned patients.\r"

An immersion pattern was present in 59%; six patients had a classic forced immersion injury. Fourteen children had nonburn trauma. Four patients died: all had tap water immersion burns. Inflicted burns are usually manifested by characteristic patterns of injury, which must be correlated with the given history. When compared with accidentally burned children, abused children were significantly younger, had longer hospital stays, and had a higher mortality. A team approach to child abuse with the addition of a specially trained group is important to insure prompt recognition, more objective appraisals, and further followup.\r"

Twenty-five patients suffered blunt and four had penetrating trauma. Twenty-seven patients had preoperative arteriography which showed at least one interrupted tibial artery. In nine patients, immediate and successful reconstruction was done. Since the foot was viable in 20 patients, immediate reconstruction was not carried out in spite of the diagnosis of tibial arterial injury. Three of 20 underwent primary amputation. Fifteen of the remaining 17 patients required further angiographic evaluation for arterial reconstructions 2 to 12 months later for nonhealing of wounds, malunion of fractures, and soft-tissue defects. Delayed reconstructions were generally more complex. In 13 patients both viable and functional feet were eventually achieved. Bypass with autogenous vein was mandatory for success. Our experience has shown that most tibial arterial trauma will require immediate repair for success. Delayed repair was more difficult and was associated with substantial limb loss.\r"

The role of the physician in routine triage is disputed and his/her value has not been documented. This study explored the severity of injury of three groups of trauma patients triaged by different guidelines to a Level I urban trauma center. Results showed that with physician input in the triage process, patients chosen for helicopter transport to the trauma center had a significantly higher median level of injury severity than patients triaged to the trauma center without physician involvement. The results have implications for controlling overtriage of patients to trauma centers.\r"

No major arterial injury was discovered in either group. Exclusion of these patients would have improved the extremity angiographic yield from 25% to 58% while missing no patients with major arterial injury. We conclude, based on the negligible yield, that clinical observation of these patients is a safe alternative if adequate followup is assured; elective angiography may be performed if followup is questionable. Nineteen of 20 (95%) patients with an absent distal pulse and clinical signs of extremity ischemia had a major arterial injury. All extremity arterial injuries occurred within 5 cm of bullet fragments, bone fragments, entrance wound, or exit wound. Given the virtual assurance of finding major arterial injury, patients with unifocal injury and a threatened limb may proceed directly to the operating room to minimize ischemic time.\r"

  ".W": "The pathophysiology of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) seems to be based on a cybernetic imbalance of the central nervous system (CNS), with activation of secondary peripheral effectors (PE). Lung vascular hyperpermeability is a crucial feature of PE actions in ARDS. Kinins (Bk), as PE, are important vascular hyperpermeability-inducing factors, with potential participation in ARDS induction. To test this hypothesis, we produced experimental ARDS in male Wistar rats using the anterior hypothalamic nuclei lesion model. Adrenalectomy, adrenal demedullation and denervation, alpha-adrenergic blockade, and catecholamine (CA) depletion reduced ARDS severity whereas beta-adrenergic blocking and CA uptake I inhibition resulted in a potentiated aspect. The Bk depletion or inhibition of the generation of these peptides resulted in attenuation of the pathologic features of ARDS. Bk half-life prolongation produced intense potentiation of the respiratory syndrome. This work suggests that Bk and CA systems are interactive and interdependent in their pathogenic actions on lungs in ARDS, involving, probably, a reciprocally-activating mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative angiography is widely used to estimate runoff before peripheral vascular bypass surgery. The Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards for the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery recently proposed an angiographic scoring system that grades the quality of vessels distal to the proposed bypass site and calculates an overall runoff score after adjusting each vessel score by an arbitrary weighting factor. We compared this score with intraoperatively measured runoff resistance in 67 patients undergoing infrainguinal bypass. Correlation between overall runoff score and measured resistance varied with the distal bypass site and was reasonably predictive for femoropopliteal above-knee bypasses (r = 0.67, p = 0.004, N = 17) and femoroposterior tibial bypasses (r = 0.73, p = 0.03, N = 9), but not for femoropopliteal below-knee (r = 0.05, p = 0.76, N = 34) or femoroperoneal (r = 0.57, p = 0.18, N = 7) bypasses. When multiple linear regression was used to calculate the weighting factors (rather than using arbitrarily assigned factors), the correlation between overall angiogram score and measured resistance improved substantially for femoropopliteal above-knee (r = 0.85, p = 0.00006), femoropopliteal below-knee (r = 0.50, p = 0.03) and femoroperoneal (r = 0.83, p = 0.02) bypasses. Correlation for the entire group of 67 patients improved from r = 0.30 (p = 0.02) to r = 0.64 (p = 0.0001). We conclude that the committee's scoring system correlates with measured runoff resistance but can be improved by the use of multiple linear regression to calculate weighting factors for each vessel in the outflow tract.\r"

The internal elastic lamina area was considered to be a measure of artery size or potential lumen area. Artery size correlated strongly with intimal plaque area at each LAD level (p less than 0.0001). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that plaque area was the principal determinant of artery size at each LAD level (r2 = 0.20 to 0.33). Sections of arteries with the most intimal plaque (highest quartile) were compared with those with the least plaque (lowest quartile) at each sample site. In the proximal LAD artery, the most severely diseased arteries increased in size 62% but lumen area decreased 25%. In the midportion of the LAD artery, plaque area was 10 times greater in the most diseased arteries, but lumen area remained normal because of an 80% increase in artery size. In the most severely diseased distal LAD artery sections, despite a fourteenfold increase in plaque area, lumen area almost doubled because of a marked increase in artery size. If no enlargement had occurred, the most severely diseased arteries in the proximal LAD segment would have developed a 92% lumen stenosis rather than the observed 25% lumen stenosis. In the distal LAD artery, without enlargement there would have been a 65% lumen stenosis rather than the 85% increase in lumen area that was found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although standard contrast angiography has been considered the diagnostic study of choice to identify pseudoaneurysms, isotope angiography has been described as an alternative method. In this study, we examined the role of 99mTc-tagged red blood cell scans in the diagnosis of traumatic pseudoaneurysm. Forty patients underwent scans; 25 scans were reported as abnormal and 15 as normal. There were no false-negative results; one scan had false-positive results (2.5%). The presence of pseudoaneurysm among the patients with abnormal scans was verified at operation in 23 of 25 patients. The one false-positive test was verified by ultrasound. All patients with normal scans were followed up for verification. Follow-up time ranged from 2 to 28 months. Radionuclide vascular flow study appears to give information similar to that of conventional angiography. With a series false-positive rate of 2.5%, the examination has a high specificity. The 99mTc-tagged red blood cell scan is a viable alternative to conventional angiography for the diagnosis of traumatic pseudoaneurysms and is associated with less radiation and morbidity.\r"

Laboratory methods were used to determine the stress caused by pressure, the surgeon's knot, and that resulting from longitudinal extension of the sutured vessel. Results showed that the stress from the surgeon's knot accounts for more than 95% of total load on the suture, the remainder resulting from pressure and geometry. At 100 mm Hg in a 10 mm carotid artery at in situ length, 5-0 Prolene suture is loaded to 22%, 6-0 to 32%, and 7-0 to 42% of their respective breaking stresses. When the cervical spine is hyperextended, the carotid artery is stretched up to 6%.

  ".W": "Controversy has surrounded the role of local hypothermia as a preoperative treatment in amputations of the lower extremity. A study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of amputation under cryoanesthesia in decreasing postoperative morbidity and mortality in below-knee (BK) amputations. Of 154 BK amputations, only 91 with unreconstructable vascular disease, gangrene, or both, were included in this study. Group I consisted of 48 patients (mean age 63.9 years) who had undergone a routine BK amputation; group II consisted of 43 patients (mean age 65.7 years) who were acutely ill and too unstable to undergo a major surgical procedure. Group II patients were treated by amputation while under cryoanesthesia before any definitive operative intervention. The patients in group II were significantly (p less than 0.05) more ill preoperatively than those in group I. Group II patients had a higher prevalence of previous myocardial infarction, previous stroke, diabetes mellitus, osteomyelitis, and wet gangrene. Seventy percent of the patients in group II had three or more risk factors vs. 46% in group I. Early postoperative mortality rates did not differ significantly between groups (group I, 8%; group II, 9%); the average length of hospital stay for group I patients was 24.2 days compared with 17.7 days in group II. Group II patients sustained slightly more postoperative complications. Amputation under cryoanesthesia appears to be of value in reducing postoperative morbidity and mortality and length of hospital stay in the acutely ill patient with unreconstructable vascular disease, gangrene, or both.\r"

All patients had been managed with support hose, elevation, elastic wraps, Unna's paste boots, and graduated compression stockings. Because of multiple recurrences of their ulcers, the patients were offered surgical treatment to reduce the venous hypertension in the areas of ulceration. The 27 patients had 32 modified Linton procedures. Five had bilateral procedures. At the time of operation, 18 limbs had medial malleolar ulcers, five had bimalleolar ulcers, four had lateral ulcers, three had posterior ulcers, and two patients were free of ulcer. Medial incisions were used in 20 limbs, lateral incisions in six, medial and lateral incisions in three, and midposterior incisions in three. Split-thickness skin grafts were placed on six limbs the day of surgery and on 22 limbs 4 to 7 days later. Postoperative complications included deep venous thrombosis in two, partial flap necrosis in three, and cellulitis of the lower leg in three patients. Follow-up has ranged from 6 months to 10 years. During the most recent clinic visits, 21 limbs were completely healed, whereas six limbs had a recurrence of the ulcer. Five patients have been lost to follow-up. The good long-term results in 78% of the cases indicate that patients with recurrent venous stasis ulcers may receive lasting benefit from modified Linton procedures.\r"

The clinical and laboratory features at the time of the acute illness and during four years of follow-up are described. The agent, A pullulans, was identified as a contaminant of the heating-cooling ventilation units containing open waterspray chambers. Control was accomplished by replacement of the ventilation systems. A secondary source of antigen was found to be corrugated cardboard. Some sensitized employees required removal from work exposure to corrugated cardboard to prevent recurrent symptoms.\r"

To understand this role further, the current study determined the stability and evolution of specialty preferences between the time of the Medical College Admission Test and the senior year of medical school. The study included 10,321 US medical school graduates in 1983. Eighty percent changed their specialty preference during this interval, demonstrating the substantial effects that medical schools have on specialty selection. The stability of early preferences ranged from 41% to 1%. Interest in primary care specialties declined among both men and women; interest in specialty care and supporting services increased during this five-year longitudinal study. These findings parallel shifts away from primary care among US medical school graduates in 1978 and 1983.\r"

Patients were randomized to metoprolol (n = 1609, 8110 patient-years) or a thiazide diuretic (n = 1625, 8070 patient-years). The median follow-up time was 4.2 years. The mean dose of metoprolol was 174 mg/d, and of thiazide diuretics, 46 mg/d of hydrochlorothiazide or 4.4 mg/d of bendroflumethiazide. Identical control of blood pressure was achieved using a fixed therapeutic schedule. Total mortality was significantly lower for metoprolol than for thiazide diuretics because of fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Total mortality was also significantly lower in smokers randomized to metoprolol. The benefit demonstrated in patients treated with metoprolol seems to have important implications for clinical practice.\r"

We reviewed information reported to the International Air Transport Association on in-flight deaths that occurred during commercial air travel for the eight years between 1977 and 1984. Of the 120 airlines in the International Air Transport Association, 42 carriers reported deaths during these eight years. A total of 577 in-flight deaths were recorded, for a reported average of 72 deaths per year. Deaths occurred at average rates of 0.31 per million passengers, 125 per billion passenger-kilometers, and 25.1 per million departures. The majority of those who died were men (66%, 382/577) and middle-aged (mean age, 53.8 years). Most of the individuals (77%, 399/515) reported no health problems prior to travel. Physicians aboard the aircraft offered medical assistance for 43% (247/577) of the deaths. More than half of the deaths (56%, 326/577) seemed to be related to cardiac problems. Sudden unexpected cardiac death was the cause of death in 63% (253/399) of the apparently healthy people and seems to be the major cause of death during air travel. These observations support the initiation of programs to train cabin personnel in the skills of basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and in the use of automatic external defibrillators.\r"

We hypothesized that energy conservation measures that tighten buildings also increase risks of respiratory infection among building occupants. At four Army training centers during a 47-month period, incidence rates of febrile acute respiratory disease were compared between basic trainees in modern (energy-efficient design and construction) and old barracks. Rates of febrile acute respiratory disease were significantly higher among trainees in modern barracks (adjusted relative risk estimate, 1.51; 95% confidence interval, 1.46 to 1.56), and relative risks were consistent at the four centers. These results support the hypothesis that tight buildings with closed ventilation systems significantly increase risks of respiratory-transmitted infection among congregated, immunologically susceptible occupants.\r"

At the time this finding was described, a proportion of the SC cohort had been treated for periods as long as 6.7 years, but comparable RC and SC mortality data beyond five years were not available. These data, which are described herein, indicate that the 6.7-year life-table mortality rates were 95.1/1000 participants for SC vs 116.3/1000 participants for RC, a larger mortality difference than was observed at five years. This favorable finding for SC extended to all major subgroups, including white women and those aged 30 to 49 years at trial entry. Six months after the close of the treatment trial, a two-year posttrial surveillance study, which extended mortality follow-up to 8.3 years, was conducted. The posttrial use of antihypertensive medication declined in SC and increased in RC participants so that by the end of the posttrial period, there was little difference in the percentages of SC and RC participants taking medication. Control of blood pressure, indicated by mean diastolic blood pressure and by percent of participants with a pressure of 90 mm Hg or less, was slightly better for SC than for RC participants (SC group, 86.5 mm Hg and 68% controlled; RC group, 87.8 mm Hg and 62% controlled). The absolute mortality advantage found at 6.7 years persisted and increased throughout the posttrial period of follow-up despite discontinuation of the formal SC therapy program. It is postulated that regression of hypertensive end-organ changes brought about by the more effective SC treatment caused this favorable outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple offenders are at high risk for continued drunken driving. Massachusetts, therefore, mandated that individuals convicted of a second drunken driving offense either be committed for a minimum of 7 days in a house of correction or enter a 14-day residential alcoholism treatment program for second offenders. A 2-year follow-up study of arrest rates assessed the impact of the two sentencing options on subsequent arrests for driving under the influence of liquor (DUIL). The incarcerated sample (N = 190) was slightly younger, had more prior DUIL charges and exhibited greater criminality than those who entered treatment (N = 199). Offenders admitted to the 14-day program were significantly less likely to be rearrested for drunken driving (10 vs 20%). A summary odds ratio suggested that when adjusted for differences in prior arrests, the risk of rearrest was 1.9 times greater among incarcerated offenders. Although a 2-year follow-up is insufficient to assess the complete impact of the 14-day program, the two-fold difference in the risk of rearrest suggests that mandated short-term residential treatment may provide an effective intervention among repeat offender drunken drivers.\r"

The questionnaire was distributed to five different A.A. groups. Subjects were asked to rate themselves, using a Likert scale, on their level of involvement in the A.A. program and were also asked to state if they had relapsed during the course of their involvement with A.A. and if so, to indicate their most recent relapse. Depending on their answers to the relapse question, subjects were placed in either a relapse or a no relapse group. The level of involvement in A.A. was found to be related to whether relapse occurred. Those in the relapse group rated themselves lower in every area of involvement listed on the questionnaire than those in the no relapse group. The most significant area of involvement, where the greatest differences between subjects in each group were found, was in reaching out to other members of A.A. for help and in the use of a sponsor.\r"

A total of 384 adolescents completed a self-report survey instrument. Zero-ordered correlations and regression procedures indicated that adolescents in this age group have a high frequency rate of riding with drinking drivers, and that social learning variables are important in explaining the behavior. Four of the five social learning subsets were accepted as significant in understanding the social dynamics of the problem. Prevention efforts that focus on predriving youth and account for social learning variables hold promise for the development of prevention strategies.\r"

In stage one of the study, the flushing reaction to low doses of alcohol was produced in Orientals. Most subjects experienced a cutaneous flush, an increase in skin temperature, a decrease in blood pressure, an increase in pulse rate and subjective symptoms such as dizziness, sleepiness, anxiety, headache, generalized weakness and nausea. Before the administration of alcohol, one-half of the subjects were given 50 mg of diphenhydramine (H1 receptor antagonist) and 300 mg of cimetidine (H2 receptor antagonist). The second half received placebo tablets. The clearest difference between the antihistamine group and placebo group was in the skin flushing reaction. The antihistamine group showed a significant reduction in the skin flush. The antihistamine also neutralized the systolic hypotension induced by the administration of alcohol. The possible importance of histamine in the expression of sensitivity to alcohol is considered. The relevance to genetic susceptibility for development of alcoholism is discussed.\r"

A random sample of 218 adult Chinese men was interviewed using a schedule based on a national study of drinking behavior. The stereotype of Chinese as limited drinkers was partially supported by the data. Approximately 22% of the sample were abstainers whereas only 14% were heavy drinkers. Light drinkers were the modal category. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the relative importance of the significant characteristics of drinkers and abstainers. Parents' drinking behavior influenced respondent's drinking behavior, and drinkers tended to like to go to parties. Chinese men with higher education were more apt to be drinkers. A second logistic regression model was used to identify the predictive variables related to the level of drinking. Chinese men who go to bars and who have friends who drink were the most likely to be heavy drinkers.\r"

Approximately 50% of the female sample were abstainers while 80% of the men were drinkers. Heavy drinking was almost exclusively a male activity. Thus, two models of Filipino drinking were examined. Logistic regression was used to identify social factors distinguishing female drinkers from abstainers. A second model clarified the influence of similar characteristics on male Filipinos who drank limited amounts of alcohol and those who drank heavily. The only variable significant in both models was regular participation in religious service.\r"

Analyses of data from 410 university students who completed the Student Alcohol Questionnaire and the Self-Control Questionnaire indicated that both internal and external self-control strategies were significantly correlated with alcohol-related problems and alcohol consumption variables. Self-control strategies were also found to be applied differentially across drinking patterns and problem status. It was concluded that college students naturally attempt to control their alcohol consumption or the unwanted consequences related to drinking. Further research is needed to detail the self-change attempts of college-aged drinkers.\r"

There was no consistent evidence of carryover effects from curriculum exposure on subsequent use of alcohol, cigarettes or other drugs. The curriculum was ineffective in attaining its goals.\r"

  ".U": "88156250\r", 
  ".W": "Junior and senior high-school students completed a questionnaire, either once or twice (in successive years), providing measures of variables in three principal sets: (1) curricular variables, those typically addressed in contemporary alcohol education programs (knowledge about alcohol, attitudes toward alcohol, decision-making skills and self-esteem); (2) drinking behavior; and (3) noncurricular variables (demographic and social-psychological traits that typically characterize students before they are exposed to alcohol education programs). Bivariate analyses suggested that the curricular variables are related to drinking behavior, whereas multivariate analyses indicated that these same variables contribute little to the explanation of adolescent drinking when adjusted for the noncurricular variables, most of which are logically and/or chronologically prior to curriculum exposure. It is concluded that contemporary alcohol education programs do address variables that, when considered alone, appear to be related to drinking. However, these same variables make such a small independent contribution to drinking behavior that it is unlikely even a highly successful classroom intervention directed at these variables would do much to prevent alcohol use or abuse by youth.\r"

Subjects (N = 83) completed and returned an open-ended questionnaire by listing the physiological and psychosocial patient problems, factors and interventions. Selected demographic and biographic data were also collected. A nursing diagnosis classification described by others served as a basis and was adapted for the nursing diagnosis categories. Nominal data were analyzed using frequency distributions and percentages. The most difficult physiological problems in caring for alcoholic persons were categorized from subjects' responses using the nursing diagnoses of \"potential for injury,\" \"alterations in nutrition-elimination\" and \"fluid volume deficit.\" The nursing diagnosis categories of \"ineffective individual coping,\" \"ineffective family coping\" and \"noncompliance\" comprised the most difficult psychosocial patient problems. A majority of subjects reported having limited classroom and clinical experience with alcoholism; 80% expressed a need for additional inservice education. It is recommended that nursing educational programs include didatic and clinical content about alcoholism, focusing on problem areas identified and on family dynamics, communication, coping strategies and time-management strategies.\r"
