Heroin use is increasing as abusers of cocaine seek a drug to prolong cocaine's effects while blunting the postcocaine depression. Clandestine chemists have created newer, more powerful compounds--designer drugs--whose potencies are many-fold that of the presently available opioids. Aggressive airway support and use of naloxone enable the emergency physician to salvage many of these patients, leaving the many medical complications of parenteral and inhalational use as the greatest management challenge.\r"

Most have effects similar to those of more popular synthetic drugs but can cause unpleasant side effects and unpredictable results. Identification of the offending botanic agent can be problematic. These plants are still used because most are legal to possess, and they do produce desired hallucinogenic and stimulant effects. Because the active ingredients are similar pharmacologically to agents such as LSD and amphetamine, required treatment is often similar. The challenge for the Emergency Department physician is to recognize the potential for abuse of these botanic agents, their probable side effects, and the need for appropriate, usually supportive, treatment. There are many more plants with abuse potential than can be discussed in detail in an article of this size. Table 1 lists a number of other agents that might be misused. Phenylamine hallucinogens occur in several species and include N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), N-monomethyltryptamine (MMT), 5-methoxy-N-N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), 5-methoxy-N-monomethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), 5-methoxy-N-monomethyltryptamine (5-MeO-MMT), 5-hydroxy-N-N-dimethyltryptamine (bufotenine or 5-H-DMT), and N,N-dimethyltryptamine-N-oxide (DMT-N-oxide).\r"

Although it may be easy to recognize \"skid row\" alcoholics, a drug abuser with track marks on his (or her) arms or with a perforated nasal septum, the executive alcoholic, the elderly patient on chronic diazepam therapy, or the \"blue collar\" worker using cocaine may be more common and more elusive. Because most drug abusers use and can be dependent on multiple drugs, detoxification may need to proceed with one drug or one class of drugs at a time. Although our discussion has concentrated on the acute presentation and treatment of these symptoms for the emergency physician, we recognize that the acute treatment of withdrawal symptoms is only a small but vital part of withdrawal treatment. These patients will require chronic treatment, including social and psychologic counseling. As emergency physicians, by performing our jobs of recognition, stabilization, and counseling, we will fulfill the first critical link in the treatment of these patients.\r"

Two important trends may hamper our understanding of the potential reproductive risks of recreational drugs: 1. The clustering of many other risk factors in the same women. 2. A tendency to publish studies showing adverse reproductive fetal effects while discouraging reports of no effects by drugs and chemicals. Although short-term research has addressed some of the immediate postnatal physical and behavioral performance of these babies, much more work is needed to address the difficult questions of long-term neurobehavioral outcome in babies exposed to recreational drug abuse in utero.\r"

Do pharmacologic relationships exist? In ordering test requests, the laboratory should allow the physician to order limited test combinations, and the physician can assist the laboratory in the search for unknowns by indicating the running diagnosis and suspected drugs. Only a few drugs require quantitation in serum in order to assist in therapeutic decisions. Urine drug screening is useful in documenting intoxications due to drugs and frequently demonstrates more drugs or drugs other than those clinically expected. The impact of findings from emergency drug screening upon diagnosis and therapy appears to be low. Although comprehensive drug screening in the emergency setting has a better positive predictive value (\"rule-in\") than negative predictive value, toxicologic screening may be useful as a \"rule-out\" test in other diagnostic applications of lower prior probability. Future directions in laboratory diagnosis of the intoxicated patient are likely to include growth in new immunoassays with limited applications, but with rapid turnaround within the Emergency Department. Also, with improvements in technology, screening of serum drugs will become more common, including the discovery of more quantitative relationships between serum concentration and toxic effects.\r"

In contrast, under conditions where cellular ATP levels are well preserved (i.e. high albumin concentration in the medium), the inhibition of transport was reduced to about 30%, but that of insulin binding was not. Because depletion of the cellular ATP level by more than 60% by metabolic inhibitors induced 40% or more inhibition of insulin-stimulated MeGlc transport, the greater inhibition of the transport with the low albumin concentration appears to be caused in part by the secondary effect of ATP loss. The relationship between the amount of cell-bound insulin and hormone-stimulated transport activity showed that glucagon does not modulate insulin action at the step of insulin binding to its receptors. Furthermore, glucagon suppressed insulin-stimulated MeGlc transport, mainly through an attenuation of the hormone-induced increase in maximum velocity. The data show that glucagon modulates the process of signal transduction of insulin action. However, the possibility that glucagon directly modulates the process of translocation or the intrinsic activity of the glucose transporters cannot be eliminated.\r"

These peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into mice and rabbits to develop antibodies to hPR. Antibodies to the undenatured form of PR were elicited only by the peptide with amino acid sequence 533-547. Fusion of SP2/0 myeloma cells with spleen cells from mice immunized with this peptide produced several active clones. Rabbit sera from immunized animals produced one antiserum that reacted with the undenatured form of PR. One monoclonal antibody (PR-AT 4.14) and one antiserum (PR-AT533) raised against peptide-(533-547) were characterized. Binding of these antibodies to the undenatured form of PR was demonstrated by analysis of the antibody-receptor complexes on sucrose density gradients and by immunoprecipitation techniques. Binding of PR to the antibodies was inhibited by excess peptide. The antibodies did not react with estrogen, glucocorticoid, or androgen receptors, but recognized PR from human breast cancer as well as calf, rabbit, mouse, and rat uteri, indicating that this epitope was conserved among these species. Based on sucrose density gradient analysis of PR prepared and labeled in the presence of proteolysis inhibitors and sodium molybdate, the antibodies bound to a site on the intact undenatured PR, but failed to bind to partially degraded steroid-binding form of the receptor, suggesting that the antibody-binding domain is at or near a site sensitive to proteolysis.\r"

Extracellular fluids usually contain a mixture of IGFBPs, three of which have been cloned, sequenced, and designated IGFBP-1, -2, and -3. We used Western ligand blotting, immunoprecipitation, and competitive binding analysis to characterize IGFBPs found in fetal and adult rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and IGFBPs produced by cultures of neonatal rat choroid plexus, astrocytes, and C6 glial cells. Pooled rat CSF contains primarily IGFBP-2 (a narrow band at Mr = 29,000), lesser quantities of IGFBP-3 (a multicomponent broad band at Mr = 37,500-43,000), and trace amounts of low mol wt IGFBPs. Conditioned medium from cultures of choroid plexus cells contained a single binding protein corresponding to IGFBP-2, whereas C6 cells made predominately an IGFBP corresponding to IGFBP-3. Astrocytes secreted two IGFBPs corresponding to IGFBP-2 and -3, primarily IGFBP-3. Neonatal CSF contained substantially more binding activity corresponding to IGFBP-2 than did adult CSF. In all samples showing Western ligand binding profiles corresponding to IGFBP-2, identification was established by immunoprecipitation. Competitive binding analysis performed on choroid plexus IGFBP showed preferential high affinity binding for IGF-II compared with that for IGF-I. In conclusion, CSF contains a mixture of distinct IGFBPs, primarily IGFBP-2. The other IGFBPs found in CSF are capable of being synthesized locally within the central nervous system by glial cells and neurons, suggesting that they are not derived from plasma by transport across the blood-brain barrier.\r"

  ".W": "Glandular epithelial cells of the rat ventral prostate undergo programmed cell death in vivo following androgen ablation. Fragmentation of the prostatic DNA is an irreversible commitment step in this programmed cell death process. The amount of prostatic DNA fragmentation thus is a quantitative measure of the number of androgen-dependent prostatic glandular cells undergoing programmed death. An in vitro organ culture system was devised for determining rates of prostatic programmed cell death based upon the daily percentage of prostatic DNA fragmentation. To do this, rats were castrated and 2 weeks later treated in vivo for 3 days with exogenous androgen replacement to maximally stimulate DNA synthesis (i.e. proliferation) of the ventral prostatic glandular cells. In vitro organ cultures were established from these ventral prostates and the DNA of these explants was 125I-labeled by incubation in media containing [125I]iododeoxyuridine [( 125I]IDU). Using this in vivo-in vitro DNA labeling technique, greater than 85% of the [125I]IDU radioactivity was incorporated into DNA of the prostatic explants glandular cells. The decrease in 125I-radioactivity from prostatic explants was determined for over a 10-day period of organ culture. Using regression analysis of these data, the daily rate of programmed cell death of the glandular cells was determined. To test the validity of the method, organ cultures were maintained in media capable of inducing either necrotic (i.e. HgCl2-containing media) or programmed cell death (i.e. media lacking testosterone) and the daily decrease in the percentage of [125I]IDU retained in the tissue determined. In addition, the morphologic appearance of necrotic vs apoptotic cell death (i.e. programmed) was quantitated and compared to the [125I]IDU data. These studies demonstrated that this [125I]IDU labeled rat prostatic organ culture system can be used as an in vitro screen to quantitate the ability of various test agents to activate the programmed cell death pathway in prostatic glandular cells.\r"

  ".W": "Serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in rats are reduced dramatically in the latter half of pregnancy, decreasing from 1758 +/- 356 ng/ml at 12 days of pregnancy (mean +/- SD) to 761 +/- 192 ng/ml at 15 days. After parturition, IGF-I increases to nonpregnant values in 4 days. Using ligand blotting, we have demonstrated that most of the serum IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) are concurrently reduced during pregnancy. IGFBP-3, the predominant IGFBP in nonpregnant serum, is reduced to 1.3% of nonpregnant values by 21 days of pregnancy and begins to rise within 1 h postpartum (PP). The sera of 21-day pregnant (but not nonpregnant) rats degrade IGFBP-3 in vitro, and this degradation is prevented by the protease inhibitor antipain. Decreased serum IGF-I concentrations during pregnancy, therefore, may result from reduced IGFBP-3 concentrations causing increased IGF-I clearance. In addition, steady state IGF-I mRNA and peptide levels in liver are decreased in 21-day pregnant rats (37% and 42% of 4 day PP levels, respectively), suggesting that decreased synthesis of IGF-I may also lead to lower serum IGF-I concentrations. After bolus injection, [125I]IGF-I is cleared from the serum of pregnant rats nearly 5 times faster than that of 4 day PP rats (1.21 vs. 0.25 ml/min/kg, respectively). Urinary clearance is relatively insignificant (less than 4%), and [125I]IGF-I does not cross the placenta. The intermediate distribution phase of IGF-I is slower in pregnant rats than in PP rats (t1/2 alpha, 17.1 vs. 5.4 min), whereas the terminal elimination of IGF-I is twice as fast (t1/2 beta, 228.1 vs. 106.4 min). The prolonged IGF-I distribution phase in the pregnant rats may result from decreased concentrations of 34,000 and 30,000 mol wt IGFBPs, which may transport IGF-I to tissues. The faster serum elimination half-life may result from diminished IGFBP-3, leading to greater IGF-I availability to tissues in pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "Human placenta and IM-9 lymphocytes contain subpopulations of atypical insulin receptors which differ from classical insulin receptors in their higher binding affinity for insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II). Both types of insulin receptors may be derived from different but related genes, or may represent alternative post-translational modifications of the same gene product. To test these possibilities, we have examined the IGF binding characteristics of the human insulin receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells which had been stably transfected with cloned human insulin receptor cDNA (CHO-T cells). The parent CHO cells contained 3 x 10(3) rodent insulin receptors/cell, and the CHO-T cells, 2.0 x 10(6) human insulin receptors/cell. Competition binding studies showed that the binding of [125I]IGF-I and [125I]multiplication stimulating activity (MSA/rat IGF-II) to parent CHO cells was primarily to type I and II IGF receptors, which cross-react poorly or not at all with insulin. However, competition binding studies with CHO-T cells showed that [125I]IGF-I binding was displaced 60-70%, and [125I]MSA binding, 50-55%, by low concentrations of insulin (20 ng/ml) and no further by higher concentrations of insulin (500 ng/ml). The insulin-insensitive IGF binding sites corresponded to the rodent type I and II IGF receptors; the insulin-sensitive IGF binding sensitive sites resembled the human atypical insulin receptors in that they bound IGF-I and MSA with moderately high affinity and reacted with insulin, MSA, and IGF-I in that order of potency. Atypical insulin receptors were also demonstrated by insulin-sensitive [125I]IGF-I and [125I]MSA binding to solubilized CHO-T proteins adsorbed to microtiter wells coated with monoclonal antibodies specific for the human insulin receptor. These results suggest that atypical human insulin receptors are generated by differential post-translational processing of the same gene product as classical human insulin receptors.\r"

Spent medium from MCF-7 203P cells, grown in the absence of serum, was found to contain immunoreactive alpha 1-AT and alpha 1-ACHY by Western blotting. In the presence of 10(-8) M estradiol, levels of both inhibitors were increased 3- to 6-fold. Incubation of spent medium with [125I]trypsin or [125I]chymotrypsin resulted in the formation of stable 75- and 90-kDa complexes identical to the complexes formed between these proteases and the protease inhibitors in plasma, showing the release of active protease inhibitors by MCF-7 cells in culture. Immunoprecipitation of 35S-labeled proteins from the medium of cells grown in the presence of [35S]methionine yielded comparable results, confirming hormonally sensitive synthesis of both protease inhibitors. Northern blot analysis suggests that stimulation of estradiol occurs at the level of transcription. Tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (50 ng/ml) also stimulated alpha 1-AT and alpha 1-ACHY synthesis 2- to 4-fold, suggesting the involvement of protein kinase-C. Comparison studies with MCF-7 cell sublines ML, BK, 203P, and 300P (a variant spontaneously appearing after 100 passages of 203P) show a wide variation in synthesis of alpha 1-AT and alpha 1-ACHY proteins; sublines 203P and 300P synthesize both inhibitors, the ML subline synthesizes detectable amounts only of alpha 1-ACHY, while no detectable synthesis of either inhibitor was seen in the BK subline. Similar results were obtained for protease inhibitor mRNA transcription by Northern blotting, although low levels of alpha 1-AT mRNA transcription by the ML subline and of alpha 1-AT and alpha 1-ACHY mRNA transcription by the BK subline could be detected.\r"

  ".W": "These studies determined whether endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) secretion affects LHRH neuronal responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE). The intracerebroventricular (icv) infusion of either bicuculline or phaclofen (GABA-A or GABA-B receptor antagonists, respectively) into ovariectomized (OVX) estrogen-treated rats did not affect basal LH levels (95 +/- 8.5 ng/ml) obtained over the 120 min of this study. When NE was infused icv, it produced a modest rise in plasma LH, which peaked within 15 min (240 +/- 25 ng/ml) and then declined toward baseline over the next 90 min. In contrast, if bicuculline was given icv at about time zero, and NE was infused (icv) 15 min later, plasma LH secretion was markedly increased and reached a peak concentration of 723 +/- 98 ng/ml within 15 min after NE treatment. Similarly, when bicuculline was infused into the medial preoptic area (MPOA), and NE was given 15 min later (icv), a peak LH level of 726 +/- 105 ng/ml was obtained within 15 min. If phaclofen was given icv at about time zero, and NE was infused 15 min later, LH rose dramatically to reach a peak concentration of 844 +/- 126 ng/ml within 15 min; a similar amplified LH response occurred when the GABA-B antagonist was infused into the MPOA and icv NE was given 15 min later. Comparisons of the LH responses obtained over the 120 min of the study suggest that icv infusions of the GABA-B receptor antagonist were more effective in sustaining peak LH secretion than the GABA-A receptor antagonist. In other groups of rats, the MPOA was electrochemically stimulated (ECS), and the effects of icv NE alone or combined with GABA receptor antagonists were evaluated. MPOA ECS alone induced a significant rise in plasma LH, which peaked between 35-45 min and then declined to approach basal levels by 150 min. In a second group, the MPOA was ECS, and at 30 min NE was infused icv. Plasma LH levels in these rats remained significantly elevated for the next 30 min before beginning their decline. In other animals, the MPOA was stimulated, and 15 min later either bicuculline or phaclofen was infused icv. Neither drug affected the patterns or concentrations of LH obtained after MPOA ECS alone. However, when rats received MPOA ECS plus either icv bicuculline or phaclofen, and these treatments were followed 15 min later by icv infusions of NE, LH secretion patterns and levels were altered significantly.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90353279\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies suggest two roles for estradiol in inducing the LH surge in ewes: a neural action to evoke a sudden release of GnRH and a pituitary action to maximize response to GnRH. We tested two hypotheses: a follicular phase estradiol rise induces a GnRH surge; and the surge-inducing action of estradiol does not vary with season. In the breeding season, ewes in the midluteal phase of the estrous cycle were ovariectomized and treated with implants producing luteal phase levels of estradiol and progesterone, and an apparatus was surgically installed for later sampling of pituitary portal blood. At the normal time of luteolysis (1 week later), progesterone implants were removed, simulating luteal regression. Ewes were divided into two groups: estradiol implants also removed (n = 6) and estradiol implants added 16 h after progesterone removal to produce a rise in estradiol to levels that mimic those that circulate in the late follicular phase (n = 6). In anestrus, the estradiol rise treatment was replicated in ewes (n = 5) after an artificial luteal phase produced by sequential insertion and subsequent removal of progesterone implants. Regardless of season, the LH surge induced by estradiol was invariably accompanied by a massive GnRH surge, ranging from 73- to 394-fold over presurge values. The GnRH and LH surges began together, but the GnRH surge continued well beyond the surge of LH. There was no seasonal difference in time course or amplitude of the GnRH surge. Control ewes not treated with estradiol exhibited regular pulses of LH and GnRH every 1-2 h, but no surge of either hormone. We conclude that, regardless of season, a rise in estradiol to late follicular phase levels initiates a large and abrupt GnRH surge coincident with the onset of the LH surge. The LH surge ends despite continued elevation of GnRH.\r"

We examined the ontogeny and pituitary regulation of testicular GHRH-like mRNA (t-GHRH mRNA) and compared this to expression of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF-II mRNA in developing testis. t-GHRH mRNA was measured by dot blot hybridization and quantitated using a hypothalamic GHRH cRNA standard. t-GHRH mRNA was not detectable in Northern blots in fetal testis on day 19 of gestation, but was present in low but detectable amounts in testicular dot blots on day 2 of life (0.44 pg/micrograms total RNA). Levels of the RNA increased beginning on day 21 (1.72 +/- 0.23 pg/micrograms total RNA) and reached adult levels by day 30 (4.96 +/- 0.84 pg/micrograms total RNA). The GHRH species on Northern analysis was about 1750 nucleotides at all ages examined; there was a larger species of about 3350 nucleotides seen on days 65 and 90. There was no correlation between the ontogeny of t-GHRH mRNA and either IGF-I or IGF-II mRNAs, which were maximally expressed in the testes of day 2 animals and decreased with age. To examine the influence of the pituitary gland on t-GHRH mRNA, levels of the mRNA were measured in the tests of hypophysectomized animals and age-matched controls. In animals hypophysectomized on day 21 and killed on day 42 and in animals hypophysectomized on day 42 and killed on day 63, there was marked diminution of t-GHRH mRNA (19 +/- 5% and 9 +/- 2% of age-matched controls, respectively). In contrast, in animals hypophysectomized on day 65 and killed on either day 80 or 90, there was a much smaller difference in levels of t-GHRH mRNA compared to values in control animals (73 +/- 20%). This was unlike the effect of hypophysectomy on testicular IGF-I mRNA, where uniform diminution was seen in all three groups. Because GH is important in the regulation of hypothalamic GHRH mRNA, we examined the effects of administration of recombinant human GH on the reinduction of t-GHRH mRNA after hypophysectomy and compared this to the reinduction of IGF-I mRNA. Neither t-GHRH mRNA nor testicular IGF-I mRNA increased in hypophysectomized animals treated with GH. Our results indicate that t-GHRH mRNA is developmentally regulated, and that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is important in its expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Ovariectomized ewes were treated with 100 IU insulin, iv, which caused reductions in blood sugar and plasma LH concentrations. The effect was prevented by the infusion (iv) of glucose, suggesting that neuroglycopenia and not a direct action of insulin was the cause of reduced LH secretion. An iv infusion of naloxone (40 mg/h for 2 h), which commenced 25 min before the insulin injection, blocked the inhibitory effect of insulin on LH secretion, but it did not prevent the decrease in plasma glucose concentrations. In this treatment group and in a group treated only with naloxone, the opioid antagonist significantly stimulated LH secretion. To determine whether CRF might be involved in the insulin-induced decrease in LH secretion, 50 micrograms CRF were injected into ovariectomized sheep. Despite producing very high circulating concentrations of CRF within 2 min of injection and the stimulation of cortisol secretion during most of the 4-h posttreatment period, plasma LH levels were not affected. In addition, the intracerebroventricular administration of 10 micrograms CRF or 10 micrograms CRF plus 10 micrograms arginine vasopressin (AVP) did not affect LH secretion. These observations suggest that insulin-induced hypoglycemia decreased LH secretion by neuroglycopenia. This may involve an opioidergic mechanism, but does not involve activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis.\r"

Since islet tissue is composed of endocrine as well as nonendocrine cells, we examined whether the DNA synthesis that is detectable in intact islets in vitro corresponds to an activity of islet B cells, islet endocrine non-B cells and/or nonendocrine islet cells. DNA synthesis was quantified by [3H]thymidine incorporation in trichloracetic acid precipitable material, by nuclear thymidine labeling in autoradiographs, and by nuclear bromodeoxyuridine fluorescence. Adult islet endocrine purified B cells, as well as other endocrine islet cells, incorporated 1 to 2 fmol thymidine/1000 cells, which is 3 times lower than intact islet tissue and 30 times lower than nonendocrine islet cells. Addition of 10% fetal calf serum did not increase DNA synthesis in purified endocrine islet cells but doubled it in intact islets and enhanced it 8-fold in nonendocrine islet cells. The higher thymidine incorporation in intact islets was due to the presence of nonendocrine cells. An increase in medium glucose concentration from 100 to 200 mg/100 ml doubled the thymidine incorporation in purified islet B cells, but not in other endocrine islet cells; no concomitant increase in the number of thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine-labeled nuclei was observed. A phenomenon of glucose-stimulated DNA repair was not excluded. Using three different methods, we have found no evidence for a proliferating activity of adult rat islet B cells under the selected in vitro conditions of this study.\r"

Human colonic mucin glycoproteins were isolated by Sepharose 4B gel filtration chromatography, they were proteolytically degraded with trypsin, pronase, and papain, and the glycoprotein fractions were reisolated by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration chromatography. Binding of the mucin glycoprotein fractions to amoebae was quantitated by the inhibition of adherence of Chinese hamster ovary cells to the surface of the amoebae. Trypsin and papain digests caused 40 and 20% reductions, respectively, in the excluded fractions (void volume) that contained all the carbohydrates; pronase digests resulted in extensive degradation of the mucin glycoprotein with the carbohydrate fractions eluting over 40% of the gel bed volume. 3H-labelled mucin glycoprotein and sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the presence of the high molecular weight carbohydrate-rich glycoproteins with no subunits in the excluded fractions and the absence of sugars in the included peptides. Only the high molecular weight carbohydrate-containing fractions bind amoebae and inhibit amoebic adherence to Chinese hamster ovary cells. The trypsin digested mucins in the excluded volume were more efficient than the native undigested mucins in binding amoebae.

In the healthy volunteers and patients with non-pancreatic digestive disease pancreatic stimulation caused a significant decrease (p less than 0.001) in plasma amino acid concentration, whereas in patients with chronic pancreatitis the decrease did not occur or was only slight. In six healthy volunteers and 24 patients with chronic pancreatitis (nine mild to moderate, 15 severe) repetition of the test using caerulein alone showed no significant differences from combined stimulation. Using the maximal per cent decrease in plasma amino acid concentration as an index of pancreatic function (lower normal limit 14%), 20 of the 25 patients with mild to moderate pancreatitis (80%) and 32 of the 35 with severe pancreatitis (91.4%) had values clearly below normal. The overall sensitivity of the test (86.7%) was significantly greater than that of the pancreolauryl test (64.2%) (p less than 0.02) and that of faecal chymotrypsin (66%) (p less than 0.05). None of the patients with non-pancreatic digestive disease had abnormal values. We conclude that the assessment of the decrease in the plasma amino acid concentration during pancreatic stimulation with secretin and caerulein is a simple, sensitive, and highly specific test of pancreatic function. The data obtained using caerulein stimulation alone suggest that the test can be further simplified, and made less costly, by eliminating the use of secretin.\r"

The predictive value for a benign diagnosis was 0.25 for histological specimens for both examiners and 0.33 and 0.45 for the two evaluations of the cytological specimens. False benign diagnoses seemed to be related to both sampling error and difficulties in interpreting the biopsy specimens. The intraobserver and interobserver kappa values concerning reproducibility of diagnoses were higher for histological specimens (0.80 and 0.74) than for cytological specimens (0.70 and 0.61). Consistent malignant diagnoses, however, occurred more often with cytological specimens (51 cases) than with histological specimens (39 cases) (p less than 0.05) and consistent diagnoses of insufficient material were more common with histological specimens (18 cases v six cases).

  ".W": "In a multicenter study, 390 patients with sustained symptomatic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation late after acute myocardial infarction were prospectively followed up to assess determinants of mortality and recurrence of arrhythmic events. Patients were given standard antiarrhythmic treatment, which consisted primarily of drug therapy. During a mean follow-up period of 1.9 years, 133 patients (34%) died; arrhythmic events and heart failure were the most common cause of death (41 patients [11%] died suddenly, 31 [8%] died because of recurrent ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation and 23 [6%] died of heart failure). One hundred ninety-two patients (49%) had at least one recurrent arrhythmic event; 85% of first recurrent arrhythmic events were nonfatal. Multivariate analysis of data from patients who developed the arrhythmia less than 6 weeks after infarction identified five variables as independent determinants of total mortality: 1) age greater than 70 years (risk ratio 4.5); 2) Killip class III or IV in the subacute phase of infarction (risk ratio 3.5); 3) cardiac arrest during the index arrhythmia (risk ratio 1.7); 4) anterior infarction (risk ratio 2.2); and 5) multiple previous infarctions (risk ratio 1.6). Multivariate analysis of data from patients developing the arrhythmia greater than 6 weeks after infarction identified four variables as independently predictive of total mortality: 1) Q wave infarction (risk ratio 2.1); 2) cardiac arrest during the index arrhythmia (risk ratio 1.7); 3) Killip class III or IV in the subacute phase of infarction (risk ratio 1.7); and 4) multiple previous infarctions (risk ratio 1.4). The results of the two multivariate analyses were used in a model for prediction of mortality at 1 year. The average predicted mortality rate varied considerably according to the model: for 243 patients (62%) with the lowest risk, it was 13%, corresponding to an observed mortality rate of 12%; for 92 patients (24%) with intermediate risk, it was 27%, corresponding to an observed rate of 28%; for 55 patients (14%) with the highest risk, it was 64%, corresponding to an observed rate of 54%. This study shows that patients with symptomatic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation late after myocardial infarction who are given standard antiarrhythmic treatment have a high mortality rate. The predictive model presented identifies patients at low, intermediate and high risk of death and can be of help in designing the appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for the individual patient.\r"

  ".W": "The accuracy of catheter-based intravascular ultrasonography to define luminal size in humans in vivo and its sensitivity to describe lesion morphology have not been previously reported. Vessel diameter, cross-sectional area and lesion characteristics assessed by digital subtraction angiography and intravascular ultrasonography (20 MHz) were compared in 86 human arterial segments. The same arterial segments were imaged and analyzed by digital subtraction angiography and intravascular ultrasonography at 49 femoral, 3 renal, 5 iliac, 7 pulmonary and 22 aortic sites. Digital subtraction angiographic diameter and area were determined geometrically by an automated algorithm. Intravascular ultrasonographic diameter and area were determined by planimetry. Linear correlation for diameter by the two techniques was 0.97, standard error of the estimate (SEE) = 1.83 mm, and for cross-sectional area it was 0.95, SEE = 0.65 cm2. Intravascular ultrasonography identified 24 sites in which plaque was present; 11 (46%) of these segments appeared normal by digital subtraction angiography. Conversely, digital subtraction angiography demonstrated irregularities in 18 segments of which 5 (28%) appeared normal by intravascular ultrasonography. These data indicate an excellent correlation between intravascular ultrasonography and digital subtraction angiography for in vivo assessment of human arterial dimensions in normal and minimally diseased segments. However, intravascular ultrasonography is more likely to identify atherosclerotic plaque that may be angiographically \"silent.\"\r"

  ".W": "Some studies suggest that abnormal behaviors are associated with increasing cognitive loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Other studies do not show this association. We examined the relation of cognitive loss, represented by Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, with abnormal behaviors in 680 patients with probable AD. Six behaviors were examined: agitation/anger, personality change, wandering, hallucinations/delusions, insomnia, and depression. All but depression were associated with declining MMSE score. The number of abnormal behaviors present in each patient was also related to declining MMSE score. Several other associations were also found: hallucinations/delusions were associated with age and race; agitation/anger was related to male gender; and wandering was associated with increased age. Although these data support the general notion that five of the six abnormal behaviors studied are more likely to occur with increasing cognitive loss, the correlations are small and it is suggested that other as yet unproven factors may play an as large or greater role than MMSE score in predicting such behaviors.\r"

There is evidence that alterations in the synaptic availability of particular neuropeptides occur in certain neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and affective disorders. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting a sizable proportion of our aging population. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques in the central nervous system. Postmortem studies have provided evidence that several neuropeptide-containing neurons are pathologically altered in this disorder. The purpose of this article is to describe recent advances in neuropeptide biology with a focus on the role of neuropeptides in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.\r"

Stool samples were collected from children hospitalized during 1979-1989 at Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, and from children from a more rural population hospitalized during 1981-1989 in the north-central USA. The predominant serotype varied from year to year in Houston, with serotypes 1, 3, and 4 each predominant in 1 or more years. In the north-central population only serotype 1 was predominant each year. Within a single rotavirus season in the Houston area, serotypes were not equally distributed by week of the season or county of residence. These differences in the distribution of serotypes have broad implications for the design and interpretation of vaccine programs.\r"

Each strain exhibited one to three major protein bands in the 35- to 41.5-kDa range and one or two protein bands of lesser density in the 24.5- to 28-kDa range. Eleven OMP patterns were distinguished among the strains. While oral strains obtained from periodontally healthy and diseased subjects exhibited diverse OMP patterns, five of six strains from extraoral sites of infection expressed an identical OMP pattern. Comparison of the electrophoretic mobilities of LPS from these same strains revealed that E. corrodens LPS consists primarily of low apparent molecular mass forms. Sixteen different LPS phenotypes were differentiated among the strains, with no apparent correlation between LPS phenotype and clinical setting. Strains expressing the same OMP pattern frequently expressed variable LPS phenotypes and vice versa. Analysis of OMP or LPS pattern by SDS-PAGE may be useful in taxonomic and epidemiologic studies of E. corrodens. Additional studies assessing the potential influence of OMP composition on invasiveness of this organism appear warranted.\r"

Laboratory review detected 71 infants with early-onset disease (1.09 cases/1000 live births) and 37 infants with late-onset disease (0.57 cases/1000 live births). Compared with the 64,858 births in Atlanta in the same period, infants with early-onset GBS disease were more often black, less than 2500 g, and born to teenage mothers. A history of miscarriage increased a woman's risk of delivering an infant with early-onset disease. Black infants had 35 times the risk of late-onset disease that nonblack infants had. Thirty percent of early-onset disease and 92% of late-onset disease could be attributed to black race, independent of other risk factors. Most case-mothers (96%) received prenatal care, suggesting that prevention strategies such as prenatal screening or maternal immunization could reach nearly all the population at risk.\r"

At the completion of treatment, there was resolution or marked improvement in symptoms in 57 (95%) of 60 ciprofloxacin-treated patients, 23 (88%) of 26 ampicillin-treated patients infected with an ampicillin-susceptible strain of Shigella, and 15 (43%) of 35 ampicillin-treated patients infected with an ampicillin-resistant strain of Shigella (ampicillin-R group) (P less than .01, ciprofloxacin or ampicillin groups vs. ampicillin-R group). Bacteriologic failure was less common (P less than .025) in the ciprofloxacin group (0/60) than in the ampicillin (3/26, 12%) or ampicillin-R groups (5/35, 14%). Ciprofloxacin-treated patients had a mean of 29 stools during the study, compared with 46 for ampicillin-treated patients (P = .004). Thus ciprofloxacin seems to be an effective, and perhaps superior, alternative to ampicillin in treating patients with shigellosis.\r"

The effect in vitro (ER) was defined as the difference between the growth rate without antibiotic and the growth rate at the steepest part of a 3-h growth curve in the presence of an antibiotic. The relation between concentration and ER was described with the Hill equation. Using pharmacokinetic parameters of the plasma concentrations in vivo and those of the Hill equation the corresponding time course of ER was calculated and by integration with respect to time (0tERdt), an estimate was obtained of the effect on bacteria. For all four antibiotics this estimate was significantly correlated with the actual values of the effect in vivo (EN), defined as the difference in numbers of bacteria between controls and antibiotic-treated animals at 4 h.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of opportunistic infections in AIDS patients is changing rapidly as new drugs become available and new studies of old drugs are completed. I have tried to use the AIDS commentaries to keep up with these advances. Since fluconazole has just recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, I asked Dr. Robert A. Larsen, an active clinical investigator at the University of Southern California School of Medicine, to review his current recommendations for the use of the azoles in AIDS patients. The response to therapy of the various mycoses in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is dramatically different from that in other patient populations and has different end points in each group. Cure is uncommon in HIV-infected patients, and relapsing infection when antifungal therapy is stopped is the rule. Control of infection with relief of symptoms and return to productive, high-quality life is therefore a commendable goal and a reasonable end point. Thus, the azoles, especially fluconazole, are important additions. From the data presented here it appears that amphotericin may still have an edge over fluconazole for acute therapy of cryptococcal meningitis in sicker patients, at least for the first several weeks (although fluconazole may be as good and is certainly less toxic and easier to administer for patients who can take oral medications). Whether 5FC should be added when amphotericin is used for acute therapy is still controversial. Dr. Larsen appears to favor it while my group feels that the potentiation of bone marrow toxicity without any clear evidence of enhanced efficacy in AIDS patients argues against its use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since oral administration of antigens has been described to induce suppressor cells, our results suggest that the development of AIA is controlled by suppressor mechanisms, which fail to be activated in the susceptible strain, but are stimulated by the oral administration of BCG.\r"

  ".U": "90355254\r", 
  ".W": "The following study was done to assess whether fibrin glue-antibiotic suspension (FGAS) can prevent infection of a PTFE vascular graft in a contaminated wound. METHODS: FGAS was made by combining cryoprecipitate with a mixture of bovine thrombin, aminocaproic acid, and tobramycin (5 mg/cc thrombus). Antibiotic activity was documented by in vitro kinetics which revealed initial elutions to be greater than 8,000 mu gm/cc and elutions at 4 days to be greater than 2 mcg/cc. Twelve dogs had a 1-cm section of infrarenal aorta replaced with a PTFE graft that had been bathed in a 2-cc solution of E. coli 3 x 10(8) CFU/ml and S. aureus 3 x 10(8) CFU/ml. Both organisms were sensitive to tobramycin and cefonicid. Dogs were divided into three groups of four. Group I had a contaminated PTFE graft placed and no further therapy. Group II had a contaminated PTFE graft placed and sealed with fibrin glue. Group III had a contaminated PTFE graft placed and sealed with FGAS. All three groups received daily IV cefonicid. RESULTS: Group I: Four of four dogs were reoperated on the fourth day for suspected sepsis and all four had pseudoaneurysms (one ruptured). Three of four were culture positive for S. aureus and two of four positive for E. coli. Group II: Four of four died of anastomotic disruption by the third day. Four of four were culture positive for S. aureus and E. coli. Group III: All four dogs survived and were sacrificed on Day 17: all anastomoses were normal. Animal survival was significantly associated with the treatment given (p = 0.0025). Three of four tissue cultures of the grafts were weakly positive for S. aureus and one of four for E. coli and Pseudomonas. Serum tobramycin levels were negligible at 12, 24, 72, and 96 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The data show that FGAS was associated with a reduction in vascular graft infection and pseudoaneurysm formation after exposure to a standardized bacterial inoculum. Whether complete eradication of all organisms can be achieved with higher doses of tobramycin is as yet undetermined.\r"

  ".U": "90355255\r", 
  ".W": "We evaluated 35 consecutive patients treated with temporary intraabdominal packing for control of bleeding to determine factors that could improve hemorrhage control, morbidity from infection, and mortality. Twelve patients could not be resuscitated from hemorrhagic shock and died in the operating or recovery room. Bleeding was controlled in the remaining 23 patients; however, five (22%) died of complications other than hemorrhage. Intra-abdominal abscesses occurred in seven of the 21 patients who survived longer than 5 days and were more frequent in patients who had gastrointestinal perforation (50% versus 27%) and selective hepatic artery ligation (80% versus 19%). Four patients with either retrohepatic vena cava injury, hepatic vein injury, or both, were packed without attempted repair; three underwent delayed repair and survived. Coagulopathy occurred in 55% of patients who received greater than 15 units of blood before packing but in only 17% who received less than 15 units. The abdomens of ten patients were closed with a prosthetic mesh which did not prevent hemorrhage control, and only one patient developed a wound infection compared to 42% of patients with primary suture closure. We therefore conclude: 1) packing is more effective if instituted early (when less than 15 units of blood have been transfused) and is not contraindicated before either repair of retrohepatic vena cava injury, hepatic vein injury, or both; 2) selective hepatic artery ligation should be avoided if packing alone stops bleeding; 3) abdominal closure with a synthetic mesh decreases the incidence of wound infection; and 4) patients should be returned to the operating room for repacking if 24-hour postoperative blood requirements exceed 10 units.\r"

Phagocytosis was studied in a receptor-specific fashion looking at the interrelationship between FcRIII-, complement receptor (CR1)-, and complement receptor 3 (CR3)-mediated phagocytosis. Twelve swine underwent either sham laparotomy (n = 5) or laparotomy with cecal ligation and incision (n = 7) to induce intra-abdominal sepsis. PMN phagocytosis was assayed on POD 1, 4, and 8. In animals undergoing sham laparotomy, FcRIII-mediated phagocytosis was less than 10% on all days and was augmented with the addition of C3b or C3bi to the target particles (FcR + CR1 or FcR + CR3 greater than FcR alone). In animals undergoing cecal ligation and incision, baseline FcRIII-mediated phagocytosis increased between POD 1 and 4 and fell between POD 4 and 8. No increase in phagocytosis was seen on POD 4 or 8 with the addition of C3b or C3bi to the target particles (FcR + CR1 or FcR + CR3 = FcR alone). Preligation of the FcRIII but not FcRII or FcRI receptor with a monoclonal antibody (3G8) markedly reduced phagocytosis in the animals with intraabdominal sepsis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Melanocytes were identified by immunohistochemistry based on a monoclonal antibody (MEL-5) that has previously been shown to react specifically with melanocytes. During the first 7 days of growth in primary culture, the total number of melanocytes in the epidermal cultures decreased to 10% of the number present in normal skin. Beginning on day 2 of culture, bipolar melanocytes were present at a mean cell density of 116 +/- 2/mm2; the keratinocyte to melanocyte ratio was preserved during further primary culture and through three subpassages. Moreover, exposure of cultures to mild UVB irradiation stimulated the melanocytes to proliferate, suggesting that the melanocytes growing in culture maintained their responsiveness to external stimuli. When the sheets of cultured cells were enzymatically detached from the plastic culture flasks before grafting, melanocytes remained in the basal layer of cells as part of the graft applied to the patient.\r"

The best computer-assisted learning programs are fully adaptive; their design anticipates the responses a user can make, classifies them, and provides feedback for each. This paper reports on two recent attempts to achieve this level of sophistication in computer-assisted drug prevention. One program seeks to prevent heroin relapse among currently abstinent prisoners, and the other promotes controlled drinking in alcohol abusers. Given the fact that most drug users can be expected to opt for self-help materials over the offer of formal therapy, and that most (licit) drug users who solve their addiction problems do so without recourse to professional help anyway, the use of computer-assisted drug prevention programs like these provides an important new direction in substance abuse treatment.\r"

  ".W": "In the final analysis the major question that arises is whether urinary diversion to the intact colon should be performed at all for benign conditions in which a relatively long life expectancy may be anticipated. In answer to this question we believe that if exstrophy is the problem early primary closure with the staged reconstruction should be attempted first. If such efforts are marred by persistent incontinence management with an artificial urinary sphincter should be considered. In individuals with multiple bladder dehiscences after attempts at primary bladder closure, or in an individual with persistent incontinence despite multiple procedures surgical alternates should include diversion by a bowel conduit, continent urinary diversion, a variant of the ureterosigmoidostomy or standard ureterosigmoidostomy. Indeed, despite the appropriate concern regarding the development of tumor in ureterosigmoidostomy, this diversion may still have a major role in the educational process of urology throughout the next decade. Specifically, we must apply the knowledge gained from our clinical and laboratory investigations of ureterosigmoid diversion to the current more popular means of diversion. Of particular concern are the clinical findings of adenocarcinoma in enteric augmentations. This discovery must serve as a warning for the possibility of urocolonic tumors developing within alternative continent urinary diversions within the next 20 to 30 years. Certainly, at least annual evaluations of any diversions are mandatory until we can define accurately the morbidity and mortality arising from our interventional management.\r"

Of the 63 patients 54 underwent nephrectomy and 9 were treated with the primary kidney tumor in place. Many of the patients underwent associated procedures, such as regional lymphadenectomy (11), venacavotomy with extraction of tumor thrombus (9), hepatic resection (2), pulmonary wedge resection (2), cholecystectomy (2), splenectomy (2), distal pancreatectomy (1), omentectomy (1) and contralateral adrenalectomy (1). Of the 54 patients 20 were not able to enter therapy because of tumor-related (17) or other medical (3) reasons that developed between the operation and therapy, while 34 were able to receive immunotherapy postoperatively. The 20 patients who were treated with either high dose interleukin-2 or interleukin-2 plus lymphokine activated killer cells soon postoperatively (mean 2.1 months) were able to tolerate roughly the same amount of interleukin-2 as the 74 who had undergone nephrectomy before referral to our institute and who were treated for a mean of 22 months after nephrectomy. Further studies, including a prospective, randomized trial, will be required to define the role of nephrectomy in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma before treatment with interleukin-2 based immunotherapies.\r"

With the Dornier HM4 device we performed 447 treatment sessions in 319 patients (483 stones). The mean number of shock waves was 1,848 per patient. The re-treatment rate was 1.17 per patient. After 3 months 85% of the patients were free of stone. Auxiliary procedures were performed in 27.6% of the sessions. From September 20, 1988 until August 30, 1989 we used the Dornier MPL 9000 lithotriptor on 246 patients with 407 stones in 354 treatment sessions. The mean number of shock waves per session was 1,654 per patient, 1.11 treatments were performed per patient and the rate free of stones after 3 months was 85%. Auxiliary measures before and after lithotripsy were performed in 33.6% of the sessions. The experience with both of these machines is discussed in regard to performance, as well as the specific advantages and disadvantages of the different imaging systems.\r"

There were 70 patients evaluated: 38 in the heparin and 32 in the control group, respectively. The recurrence rate (heparin 74%, control 66%) and the median number of recurrences (heparin 3, range 1 to 15 and control 3, range 1 to 30) were similar (p greater than 0.05) in the 2 groups of patients.

Patients received either low dose (10 million units) or high dose (100 million units) recombinant alpha-2b-interferon weekly for 12 weeks and then monthly for a maximum of 1 year. Of the 47 high and 38 low dose patients 20 (43%) and 2 (5%), respectively, achieved a complete response. Additionally, partial responses (cytology results positive with no histological evidence of carcinoma in situ) were noted in 23% of the high dose group. Notably, 6 of 9 patients who had failed prior intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy responded to alpha-2b-interferon treatment. Preliminary assessment has shown that among the complete responders 18 of 20 (90%) in the high dose group have maintained responses for at least 6 months after the completion of treatment (10 for more than 12 months). Seven patients in each treatment group have undergone radical cystectomy. All 14 patients had progressive disease except 1 who chose cystectomy although she was still responding to treatment. The median intervals from initial treatment to cystectomy were 18 and 32 weeks in the low and high dose groups, respectively. Local irritation or toxicity did not occur and other adverse effects were rare except for mild to moderate flu-like symptoms (8% in the low dose and 17% in the high dose groups). No patient discontinued therapy due to treatment-related adverse effects. Intravesical alpha-2b-interferon demonstrated a high level of activity in the treatment of carcinoma in situ of the bladder with the 100 million unit dose producing a significantly greater response rate (43% complete response, p less than 0.0001) than the low dose (5% complete response). Safety and tolerance were excellent with no local irritative toxicity.\r"

In 3 patients urinary tract infections recurred with new pathogens at 6, 560 and 820 days after post-therapy negative prostatic fluid cultures. Bacterial prostatitis with the original pathogen recurred in 5 patients within 2 months of completing therapy. The bacteria remained susceptible to norfloxacin but could not be eradicated with 30 to 90 days of additional norfloxacin therapy. Cures were achieved in 9 of 12 patients with Escherichia coli, none of 2 with Pseudomonas prostatitis and 3 of 5 with prostatic calculi. No patient experienced significant adverse effects.

  ".U": "90355324\r", 
  ".W": "Human renal cell carcinomas show a high degree of intrinsic multidrug resistance. In experimental cell lines, the membrane bound P-170 glycoprotein and the glutathione redox cycle seem to contribute to this phenomenon. P-170 may be inactivated by calcium antagonists; the glutathione redox cycle by buthionine sulfoximine. We studied the resistance patterns of 35 human renal cell carcinomas against vinblastine, doxorubicin and carboplatinum in a tetrazolium-based microculture assay. Concomitantly, P-170 expression was traced immunohistochemically using moab C219 and the glutathione content was determined enzymatically. Reversal of multidrug resistance was examined by applying the R-stereoisomer of verapamil and/or by addition of buthionine sulfoximine. A high degree of chemoresistance was seen in 27 tumors against vinblastine, in 30 tumors against doxorubicin and in 31 tumors against carboplatinum. Chemoresponse was found in eight, five or four cases respectively. P-170 was detected in 70% of highly vinblastine resistant and in 63% of highly doxorubicin resistant tumors, but in none of the less resistant cases. Resistance against carboplatinum and doxorubicin was significantly associated with elevated glutathione levels as compared to less resistant renal cell carcinomas. R-verapamil lead to a strong reversal of vinblastine resistance and to a distinct circumvention of doxorubicin resistance, but revealed no effect in carboplatinum resistance. Buthionine sulfoximine overcame carboplatinum resistance and modified doxorubicin resistance, but had no influence on vinblastine resistance. The combined application of R-verapamil and buthionine sulfoximine reversed doxorubicin resistance but did not act synergistically in vinblastine or carboplatinum resistance. Both mechanisms, P-170 and glutathione, occurred independently of each other and may well explain multidrug resistance of human renal cell carcinomas.\r"

Early testicular infarction was observed in association with epididymal inflammation. Serial transcrotal ultrasounds of infected animals showed progressive increase in epididymal size and a late decrease in testicular size. Serum and epididymal drug concentrations were assayed following a single dose of the antibiotic amdinocillin. Fifteen minutes following the peak serum level, the drug concentration in infected epididymis was 2.3-fold higher than the contralateral, non-infected epididymis. These data suggest that acute inflammation enhances antibiotic penetration into the infected epididymis. The model described provides a rapid, reproducible method to study epididymal drug delivery in normal and diseased states.\r"

  ".W": "To study the biochemical mechanisms of bladder tumor invasion, we analyzed specimens of invasive transitional cell carcinoma cell line EJ and non-invasive transitional cell carcinoma cell line RT4 which had been implanted into the bladders of nude mice. Using immunoprobes specific to basement membrane laminin, we observed that superficial but not invasive tumors were surrounded by intact laminin. With immunoprobes specific to cathepsin B, a cysteine proteinase which has the ability to degrade laminin, we demonstrated that cathepsin B is localized in discrete cytoplasmic granules in the non-invasive tumors, and in a more diffuse cytoplasmic pattern in the invasive tumors. Subcellular fractionation followed by immunoblot analysis and enzymatic analysis confirmed that the invasive EJ cells had active cathepsin B localized to its plasma membrane, while non-invasive RT4 cells had cathepsin B confined to lysosomes. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis revealed that invasive EJ cells had the mature form of cathepsin B with a molecular weight of 25 kD, while non-invasive RT4 cells had predominantly precursor forms with molecular weights between 30 and 35 kD. In vitro degradation assays with plasma membrane fractions isolated from invasive EJ cells and non-invasive RT4 cells demonstrated that the plasma membrane of EJ cells but not that of the RT4 cells had the ability to degrade purified laminin, and that the degradative products were similar to those obtained with purified cathepsin B. We conclude that invasive tumor cells have enhanced cathepsin B in their plasma membranes which may be used to degrade basement membrane components such as laminin and thereby facilitate tumor invasion.\r"

Using logistic regression to control for demographic, clinical, and hospital factors, we found that the odds that privately insured patients received angiography were 80% higher than uninsured patients; the odds were 40% higher for bypass grafting and 28% higher for angioplasty. Medicaid patients experienced odds similar to those of uninsured patients for receiving angiography and bypass, but had 48% lower odds of receiving angioplasty. In addition, the odds for Medicaid patients were lower than for privately insured patients for all three cardiac procedures. These findings suggest that insurance status is associated with the utilization of cardiac procedures. Future studies should determine the implications these findings have for appropriateness and outcome and whether interventions might improve care.\r"

This trend, which we refer to as the \"Medicaidization\" of AIDS, occurred among whites as well as blacks and Hispanics and increased the burden on public hospitals and emergency rooms. \"Medicaidization\" jeopardizes access to office-based primary care because of very low reimbursement rates that are paid to physicians by Medicaid relative to private insurance. Policies designed to prevent the loss of employment-based private insurance would slow or reverse the trend to public financing. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement will improve access to care.\r"

  ".W": "Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the most common cause of hypersomnolence in patients referred to sleep disorders centers. This type of sleep apnea is characterized by loud snoring, nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation, and disrupted sleep that leads to daytime hypersomnolence. The anatomic configuration of the pharynx and the physiologic responses to occlusion of the upper airway play a major role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. Polysomnography can accurately identify obstructive sleep apnea, and the multiple sleep latency test allows an objective measurement of daytime alertness. Weight loss and training the patient to sleep in a lateral position are frequently used to alleviate mild cases. Nasally applied continuous positive airway pressure is an extremely effective modality for treating moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnea. Surgical correction of obvious anatomic defects has a role in diminishing obstructive sleep apnea, but the exact role of surgical intervention in patients without obvious anatomic defects remains unknown. The choice of therapy should be tailored to the individual patient with sleep apnea, and careful follow-up is essential to ensure a positive response to therapy.\r"

Nasal obstruction may produce greater physiologic effects during sleep than during the awake state. A complete examination of the upper respiratory tract should be done in all patients with obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. The degree of nasal obstruction is not directly correlated with the severity of symptoms and findings.\r"

In attempts to correlate pathologic tumor stage and PSA levels, tumors of higher stage (pathologic stages C1, C2, D1, and D2) have been associated with elevated PSA levels. Increased PSA levels have also been found in patients with benign prostatic diseases (benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostatitis). PSA has been shown to be an excellent marker after radical prostatectomy and for monitoring of radiation therapy. Patients with a persistently elevated PSA level for more than 6 months postoperatively should be assessed for residual or recurrent local or systemic disease. Thus far, routine use of PSA testing as a mass screening modality for prostatic cancer has not been considered cost-effective.\r"

A healthy adolescence is one that reflects flexibility within established boundaries, adaptation to change, and growth, all manifested through an increased sense of well-being.

  ".W": "The establishment of a well adolescent schedule needs to be developed similar to the scheduled clinical visits in pediatric care. However, providing adolescent wellness visits without appropriate financial reimbursement for time expended and without increased provider training may make \"well\" adolescent visits an unrealistic expectation. However, two major trends will significantly impact on the future of adolescent health care. These include a sharp increase in numbers of adolescents beginning in 1990 and the poverty within the adolescent population. These data suggest that obstacles, whether personal, financial, or educational, need to be addressed quickly in order to resolve these problems because of increasing numbers of adolescents and related morbidities through the year 2000. The increasing trend of juvenile poverty in this population has been significantly associated with a number of the new morbidities such as substance abuse, STD, pregnancy, and the latest morbidity, AIDS. Without a wellness schedule, it is likely that adolescents will continue to represent an underserved population; as a consequence, mortalities and morbidities will increase through the year 2000. The issue of adherence to prescribed medical regimens in the adolescent population is an interesting, complex, and especially challenging one when faced with the social morbidities. Although preliminary work in this area has progressed in the last 15 years, greater attention must be paid to the needs of adolescents in order to determine effective strategies that can minimize the effects of the current morbidities. It is important for the primary care physician not to become overwhelmed with the scope of problems that adolescents have or become discouraged because anticipatory guidance seems ineffective. Repeated dosages of anticipatory guidance should not be viewed as limitations or failures but rather as necessary and standard care. One should consider such interventions as similar to immunizations, in which certain vaccines result in life-long immunity. One would not eliminate the tetanus vaccine because the patient must receive periodic boosters. Similarly, as health care professionals, we should not consider interventions designed to preclude behavior or mental health problems as failures if periodic and developmentally appropriate relevant \"boosters\" are necessary. Anticipatory guidance is an extremely effective tool that every primary care physician has at his or her disposal to assist in the diagnosis of problematic behavior in adolescents and to preclude problems. Future research needs to focus on documenting strategies that can be utilized by physicians on a daily basis without excessive time or financial constraints.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Given the high prevalence of risk-related sexual behaviors, many adolescents are likely to become HIV infected, thus requiring extensive medical and psychosocial services. Other adolescents will lose a parent, relative, or friend to AIDS, and these adolescents will similarly require special services and psychological counseling. Thus, there is an immediate need for the development of methods for (1) providing all adolescents with age-appropriate and culturally relevant interventions for prevention and risk reduction, (2) identifying high-risk adolescents and triaging them to different levels of care and risk reduction counseling, and (3) providing ongoing medical and psychosocial treatments. Accessing adolescents at risk for HIV infection will require networking between the health care system and youth-serving and community-based agencies, particularly agencies servicing high-risk adolescents. We must begin addressing these needs now, in order to prevent further infection and to provide appropriate care for those adolescents who are or will become infected with HIV.\r"

Abnormal uterine bleeding usually is the result of anovulatory cycles. However, complications of pregnancy, systemic illnesses, and local pathology must be considered. Significant bleeding usually responds to hormonal therapy. Amenorrhea may result from abnormalities affecting the hypothalamus, pituitary, or ovaries.

Although the event is rare, and rates have stabilized and even shown slight reduction in recent years, suicide has nevertheless become the second leading cause of morbidity among youths aged 15 to 24, which is otherwise a robust and relatively disease-free population. Although research on predictive factors has yielded increasingly sensitive indices of who the high-risk adolescent might be, the inherent difficulty of predicting rare events from common ones has made sensitive and specific prediction most elusive. Current neurobiologic research holds promise for the use of biologic markers in the identification of high-risk adolescents, and pharmacologic research may yield further advances in the treatment of affectively disordered youths. At this point, the most promising approaches to treating adolescent suicide appear to be (1) treatment of disorders antecedent to suicide crises, such as depression, substance abuse, family conflict, and conduct disturbance, and (2) prevention efforts targeting known high-risk groups, such as affectively disordered young men with accompanying alcohol and drug involvement and other antisocial behavior.\r"

Focusing on weight loss as a short-term goal is unreasonable because of individual variation in the physiologic potential to lose weight. Short-term goals and rewards are related to adopting daily habits that will lead to a decrease in energy storage in the long term. Support for changing habits and improving psychosocial adjustment is a necessary component of effective treatment, enabling patients and their families to make changes.\r"

In anorexia nervosa, the immediate danger is related to the effects of voluntary starvation, including hypophosphatemia, bone marrow failure, cardiac decompensation, and shock. Patients with bulimia nervosa more often experience severe fluid and electrolyte abnormalities resulting in hypovolemia, secondary hyperaldosteronism, depletion of total body potassium, and cardiac arrhythmias. Immediate management of medical complication and correction of nutritional deficits are necessary before patients can benefit from psychotherapy. The need for continued involvement of the internist in the ongoing care of the eating disorder patient is stressed. The high mortality and the likelihood of chronicity without early intervention underscore the need for early recognition and skilled management of eating disorders.\r"

As acute medical interventions are becoming more sophisticated and successful, more teenagers are surviving such accidents. However, cognitive deficits frequently result in weaknesses in intelligence, memory capacity, and abstract thinking. Such weaknesses can emerge in cases of mild head trauma as well. These cognitive deficits can have a profound impact on the adolescent's academic, social, and family functioning.\r"

In the 1970s, the search for adult risk factors in juveniles began in earnest. In the 1980s, adult risk factors were identified in juveniles and correlated with pathologic changes. The therapeutic issues that involve life-long compliance in high-risk children and adolescents are unique to this age group.\r"

Screened and control groups otherwise had the same antenatal care, which included ultrasonography according to usual practice. Screened women made fewer visits to the antenatal outpatient clinic than did women in the control group (2.3 vs 2.6). There were no differences in the number of labour inductions or mean birthweights in the two groups. Perinatal mortality was significantly lower in the screened than in the control group (4.6/1000 vs 9.0/1000); this 49.2% reduction was mainly due to improved early detection of major malformations which led to induced abortion. All twin pregnancies were detected before the 21st gestational week in the screening group compared with 76.3% in the control group; perinatal mortality in the small series of twins was 27.8/1000 vs 65.8/1000, respectively.\r"

The frequency of hypoglycaemia (blood glucose below 2.2 mmol/l) did not differ significantly between malarial and control patients (5.2% vs 11.2%) nor between the comatose (11.1% vs 18.8%) and conscious (1.6% vs 7.0%) malarial and control subgroups. Compared with normoglycaemic patients, hypoglycaemic patients had appropriately low serum insulin (3.0 vs 8.2 mU/l) and C-peptide (0.13 vs 0.42 mmol/l) and high plasma non-esterified fatty acids (1.42 vs 0.83 mmol/l). Hypoglycaemia, the level of consciousness, and death were all significantly associated with the time since the last meal. Hypoglycaemia is not a specific complication of malaria but is found in severely ill fasted children, resulting from glycogen depletion and perhaps impaired hepatic gluconeogenesis. It should be sought in all severely sick children. A single bolus dose of glucose may not be enough to correct it.\r"

The CAGE questionnaire was highly sensitive (76%) and specific (94%) for recognition of alcohol dependence (positive predictive power 87%). None of the discriminant laboratory functions gave recognition rates greater than chance alone. Until the sensitivities, specificities, and positive predictive powers of computer-assisted methods improve, brief interview alone remains the best screening method for general hospital populations.\r"

Poor adherers had an increased risk of death whether they were on propranolol (OR = 3.1) or placebo (OR = 2.5). Furthermore, this increased risk of death for poor adherers was not accounted for by measures of the severity of myocardial infarction, sociodemographic features (eg, race, marital status, education), smoking, or psychological characteristics (high life-stress or social isolation).\r"

Rarely, chronic relapsing inflammatory polyneuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies appear. Clinical evidence of glandular involvement is often minimal or absent when patients with SS develop peripheral neuropathy; and the diagnosis of the underlying condition is elusive. We review clinical and laboratory features of this disorder and suggest appropriate evaluation of patients with neuropathy and suspected SS.\r"

To extend the comparison of these differences, insulin effects on amino acid uptake and protein metabolism were studied in soleus muscles subjected to denervation or unweighting. Denervated muscle showed insulin resistance of both 2-deoxy[1,2-3H]glucose and alpha-[methyl-3H]aminoisobutyric acid uptake whereas unweighted muscle showed an increased or normal response, respectively. Atrophy was greater in denervated than in unweighted muscle, apparently due to faster protein degradation. The stimulation of protein synthesis and the inhibition of protein degradation by insulin was generally less in denervated than in unweighted muscle. Since metabolic measurements in denervated-unweighted muscles did not differ from those in denervated-weight-bearing muscles, effects of denervation must be independent of leg posture.\r"

  ".W": "BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Specific chromosomal abnormalities have been shown to affect the overall survival of patients with acute leukemia, but the possibility that specific chromosomal defects may influence the course of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is controversial. We assessed this possibility as follows: blood mononuclear cells from 433 patients with B-cell CLL in five European centers were cultured with B-cell mitogens, and banded metaphases were studied. RESULTS. Three hundred ninety-one patients could be evaluated cytogenetically, and 218 had clonal chromosomal changes. The most common abnormalities were trisomy 12 (n = 67) and structural abnormalities of chromosome 13 (n = 51; most involving the site of the retinoblastoma gene) and of chromosome 14 (n = 41). Patients with a normal karyotype had a median overall survival of more than 15 years, in contrast to 7.7 years for patients with clonal changes. Patients with single abnormalities (n = 113) did better than those with complex karyotypes (P less than 0.001). Patients with abnormalities involving chromosome 14q had poorer survival than those with aberrations of chromosome 13q (P less than 0.05). Among patients with single abnormalities, those with trisomy 12 alone had poorer survival than patients with single aberrations of chromosome 13q (P = 0.01); the latter had the same survival as those with a normal karyotype. A high percentage of cells in metaphase with chromosomal abnormalities, indicating highly proliferative leukemic cells, was associated with poor survival (P less than 0.001). Cox proportional-hazards analysis identified age, sex, the percentage of cells in metaphase with chromosomal abnormalities, and the clinical stage of the disease (Binet classification system) as independent prognostic variables. CONCLUSIONS. Chromosomal analysis provides prognostic information about overall survival in addition to that supplied by clinical data in patients with B-cell CLL.\r"

It is now shown that stimulation of the antigen receptor of T lymphocytes causes a rapid activation of p21ras. The mechanism seems to involve a decrease in the activity of GAP, the GTPase-activating protein, on stimulation of protein kinase C. In lymphocytes, p21ras may therefore be an important mediator of the action of protein kinase C.\r"

  ".U": "90356122\r", 
  ".W": "The ras genes are required for normal cell growth and mediate transformation by oncogenes encoding protein tyrosine kinases. Normal ras can transform cells in vitro and in vivo, but mutationally activated ras does so much more efficiently, and highly transforming mutant versions of ras have been isolated from a variety of human and animal tumours. The ras genes encode membrane-associated, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that are active when GTP is bound and inactive when GDP is bound. The slow intrinsic GTPase activity of normal mammalian Ras proteins can be greatly accelerated by the GTPase-activating protein (GAP), which is predominantly cytoplasmic. This activity of GAP, which can increase with cell density in contact-inhibited cells, suggests that it functions as a negative, upstream regulator of ras. Other studies, however, show that GAP interacts with a region of ras-encoded protein implicated in ras effector function, which raises the possibility that GAP might also be a downstream target of ras. Mutationally activated ras-encoded proteins also interact with GAP, although they are resistant to its catalytic activity. In an attempt to define the role of GAP in ras-mediated transformation, we examined the effects on transformation of normal or mutant ras when cells overexpress GAP. We found that GAP suppresses transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by normal Ha-ras (c-ras) but does not inhibit transformation by activated Ha-ras (v-ras). These results support the hypothesis that GAP functions as a negative regulator of normal ras and make it unlikely that GAP alone is the ras target.\r"

Cyclins have been implicated in the induction of mitosis and are associated with the serine-threonine protein kinase p34cdc2 as components of mitosis promoting factor (MPF). On the basis of conserved sequence motifs cyclins can be divided into A or B types. We recently cloned a human cyclin B and showed that cyclin B expression is regulated transcriptionally and post-translationally during the cell cycle, and that cyclin B associates with p34cdc2. Here we report that human cyclin A messenger RNA and protein levels also vary during the cell cycle, and increase and decrease in advance of cyclin B levels. Cyclin A is associated with a protein of relative molecular mass 33,000 that is related to, but distinct from, p34cdc2, and this complex has histone H1 kinase activity in vitro. Cyclin A is identical to p60, a protein that associates with p34cdc2 in interphase cells and with adenovirus E1A in transformed cells.\r"

  ".W": "Cancer of the pancreas is rising in incidence and will strike 27,000 Americans this year. There is no curative therapy for most patients, so palliation of symptoms should be the prime concern. Severe pain is very common, and often difficult to treat. Neurolytic celiac plexus block (NCPB) is claimed by some to be the most effective way to treat pancreatic cancer pain (PCP), yet only a minority of patients undergo this procedure. We have reviewed the literature on NCPB to determine if it has been adequately evaluated in the management of PCP. There have been 15 published series since 1964 on NCPB for PCP. A total of 480 patients with cancer of the pancreas were reported; at least a satisfactory response to NCPB was reported in 418 (87%). We found major deficiencies in these reports. None described the pre-NCPB analgesic history. Post-NCPB data were also limited. No information was given concerning post-NCPB analgesic dosages, and only 4 series stated that most patients did not require opiates. Information on whether NCPB was effective until death was lacking or incomplete in 12 series. Many claimed additional benefits of NCPB such as decreased nausea, decreased constipation, and increased appetite, but none provided any data to support these claims. We conclude that the data available on NCPB for PCP are insufficient to judge for efficacy, long-term morbidity, or cost effectiveness, and rigorous evaluation of the technique is required.\r"

When compared to babies who received a complete and timely course of antenatal glucocorticoids, those whose mothers received no glucocorticoids were at prominently increased risk of BPD (odds ratio = 3.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 8.2). Babies whose mothers received a partial course of glucocorticoids were not at increased risk of BPD (odds ratio = 1.3; 95% confidence interval = 0.4, 4.3). Stratification by gender and birth weight at 1 kg showed a benefit of therapy in all strata except that of extremely low birth weight male infants.

Seventy-four emergency room patients (aged 7 to 54 months) who were treated for acute asthma were studied. Treatment included, in addition to salbutamol inhalations, a single dose of intramuscular methylprednisolone (4 mg/kg) or normal saline as placebo. The patients were reevaluated 3 hours after initiation of treatment. At that time, patients were either admitted or discharged based on a clinical decision. Only 8 (20%) of 39 patients treated with steroids were admitted, compared with 15 (43%) of 35 in the placebo group (P less than .05). Sequential analysis of 33 pairs, matched by age and severity of symptoms, revealed statistically significant reduced admission rates in patients treated with steroids. In the younger patients (6 to 24 months), admission rate was significantly lower for those treated with steroids (18%) as compared with those treated without steroids (50%) (P less than .05). In the older group (24 to 54 months), the trend was similar but not statistically significant: 23% vs 31% in the steroid and placebo groups, respectively. These data indicate that corticosteroid treatment combined with an adrenergic agent, given early during an acute asthmatic episode, significantly reduces the hospital admission rate of infants and toddlers.\r"

In a patient treated in Manchester, a parasitaemia of 2.10 X 10(6) microliters (42 per cent) was virtually eliminated over eight hours by a 3.5 litre exchange blood transfusion. However, the equipment and amounts of compatible blood required for total exchange are rarely available in areas endemic for malaria and the risks of the procedure, including transfusion-related infections, are high. Partial exchange transfusion with one to two litres of blood carried out over two to seven hours, reduced Plasmodium falciparum parasitaemias of 0.33-1.48 X 10(6)/microliters (13-38 per cent) to 0.11-0.81 X 10(6) (4-17 per cent) in six Thai patients who were receiving intravenous quinine. The reduction in parasitaemia ranged from 0.13-0.67 X 10(6) microliters (9-12 per cent) within six hours. During the same period, parasitaemia in 13 patients with cerebral malaria treated with chemotherapy alone showed little reduction from initial levels of 0.20-1.74 X 10(6)/microliters (11-42 per cent). One of the patients who were treated with exchange transfusion died with intractable hypotension before the procedure could be completed and two others developed oliguric renal failure which was controlled by peritoneal dialysis. Partial exchange transfusion is a promising and practical alternative to total exchange where facilities are limited. It deserves further assessment in the rural tropics.\r"

The three-phase radionuclide bone scan allows the radiologist to judge the acute or chronic nature of the abnormality being assessed. Subluxations involving the distal radioulnar joint are relatively easily recognized with CT scanning through that joint. These abnormalities are seen infrequently and are unreliably diagnosed from the plain film examination alone. Although the triple injection arthrogram seems to be a sensitive and accurate tool for identifying ligamentous perforations including those of the triangular fibrocartilage, the potential for those diagnoses to be made with MR imaging is increasingly recognized.\r"

  ".W": "Many different imaging modalities are available to assist in the evaluation of hip disease. One must choose the image or series of images that not only provide the most diagnostic and clinical information, but also remain the simplest and most cost effective for the patient. The initial examination should be the conventional radiograph. This will provide, in most instances, the most diagnostic information for arthritic disease, stress and insufficiency fractures, infection, and bone tumors. If the conventional radiograph is normal, or if more information is needed, bone scintigraphy should be done next. Bone scintigraphy will confirm the presence of disease, demonstrate its anatomic location, and give some information as to its physiologic state. Computed tomography does not play an important role in the evaluation of hip disease except in acute fractures involving the acetabulum. MR imaging is the modality of choice for diagnosing and staging osteonecrosis, searching for marrow disease, assessing cartilage abnormality, and evaluating the extent of soft-tissue disease.\r"

Other imaging modalities may occasionally be helpful in the evaluation of specific problems including CT in tibial plateau fractures, real-time ultrasound for the confirmation of a popliteal cyst or popliteal artery aneurysm, and arthrography for the detection of prosthetic joint loosening.\r"

Sixty patients with preexisting renal insufficiency were prospectively randomized into two groups. Patients in the treated group (n = 30) received an infusion of dopamine for 12 hours starting at the beginning of arteriography. Patients who received placebo infusion with arteriography (n = 30) served as controls. The study was conducted in two different time intervals. In the first interval, serum creatinine levels and 12-hour creatinine clearance values were obtained before and immediately after arteriography in 12 patients in the dopamine group and 13 patients in the control group. In the second interval, the same variables were measured before arteriography and for 3 consecutive days after arteriography in 18 patients in the dopamine group and 17 patients in the control group. Serum creatinine levels became significantly elevated in the control group on the 1st day and remained so on the 3rd day after arteriography, whereas the dopamine group did not show significant elevation of these levels. Creatinine clearance decreased in the control group on the 1st day, but this deterioration was not sustained on the 3rd day. In the dopamine group, there was no deterioration in creatinine clearance on either day, and mean effective renal plasma flow during and after arteriography was greater.\r"

Portal vein pulsatility was also evaluated in 17 healthy adults. A pulsatility score (scale, 1-5) based on a ratio of minimum to peak portal vein velocity was assigned. A score of 1 indicated continuous, monophasic flow, while a score of 5 indicated that flow reversal was observed with each cardiac cycle. All 17 healthy volunteers had portal vein pulsatility scores of 2 or less. Among the 17 patients suspected of having congestive heart failure, seven had normal right atrial pressure (less than 10 mm Hg) and pulsatility scores of 2 or less. Among the 10 patients with a right atrial pressure of 10 mm Hg or greater, six had pulsatility scores of 3 or greater (sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 100%). Greater than 50% of the variation in portal vein score is explained by changes in right atrial pressure. Review of echocardiograms in 13 of 17 patients showed no significant correlation between the degree of tricuspid regurgitation and portal vein score. Portal vein pulsatility is a sign of elevated systemic venous pressure.\r"

With use of the criterion of a peak-systolic Doppler shift frequency of 2.5 kHz or greater as evidence of neovascularity, 26 of 37 malignant lesions demonstrated tumor signals (70% sensitivity). Thirty-one of 33 benign lesions lacked tumor signals (94% specificity). Both of the false-positive lesions were infections with inflammatory masses, with peak frequencies of 3.0 and 3.7 kHz. Tumor vascularity in most malignant renal mass lesions gives rise to abnormal, high-frequency, Doppler-shifted signals that can aid the differential diagnosis of renal masses.\r"

MR imaging enabled correct classification of the anomaly in each patient and identification of coincidental gynecologic disease in 10 patients (34%). MR imaging results influenced clinical treatment in six (24%) of 25 patients referred prospectively. Of particular value was the ability to characterize septal tissue (myometrium versus fibrous tissue), identify the patients in whom the septum of bicornuate uteri had both fibrous and myometrial components, and establish that suspected adnexal lesions were actually components of obstructed MDAs.\r"

The biopsy gun employs a needle (18 gauge) smaller than that usually used for renal biopsies. In all seven cases it provided a core biopsy specimen that contained enough glomeruli to make a definitive histologic diagnosis of renal parenchymal disease. Use of the biopsy gun eliminated the more complicated movements needed to obtain samples with the conventional manual biopsy techniques. No major complications occurred, and in only one case a minor complication, trace hematuria determined by means of dipstick analysis, was found. The time required to obtain the tissue samples was decreased with use of this technique. Because of the advantages of the biopsy gun, the authors now use it exclusively in percutaneous US-guided biopsy of native pediatric kidneys and recommended that this method be considered by other institutions performing similar biopsies.\r"

The gun biopsy yielded the correct diagnosis in four cases involving a lesion (including one cancer) that was missed at the surgical biopsy. Nine cases in which the lesion was missed at gun biopsy can be related to insufficient needle size, the greater difficulty in using one of the two stereotactic devices, and early inexperience with the technique. A 14-gauge needle was used in the last 29 biopsies, the results of which agreed with the surgical pathologic findings in 28 cases (97%). With greater experience, stereotactic-guided large-gauge automated percutaneous biopsy may prove to be an acceptable alternative to surgical biopsy in women with breast masses suspected at mammography.\r"

The value of the method lies in its ability to demonstrate fluid collection in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursal system, with gradual distention of the bursa and lateral pooling of fluid to the subdeltoid portion while the arm is elevated. In 102 of 381 patients studied, surgical diagnosis was available for correlation. Among this group there were seven false-negative and three false-positive sonographic findings. A comparison of sonographic with surgical findings demonstrated a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 95% in stages I-III, and a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 96% in early stages I and II of the impingement syndrome. The results of dynamic shoulder sonographic examination with fluoroscopic radiography provide valuable information in patients with suspected early-stage impingement syndrome.\r"

Highly basic polypeptide regions emerge from the zipper to form a linked set of DNA contact surfaces. In the recently proposed a \"scissors grip\" model, the paired set of basic regions begin DNA contact at a central point and track in opposite directions along the major groove, forming a molecular clamp around DNA. This model predicts that C/EBP must undertake significant changes in protein conformation as it binds and releases DNA. The basic region of ligand-free C/EBP is highly sensitive to protease digestion. Pronounced resistance to proteolysis occurred when C/EBP associated with its specific DNA substrate. Sequencing of discrete proteolytic fragments showed that prominent sites for proteolysis occur at two junction points predicted by the \"scissors grip\" model. One junction corresponds to the cleft where the basic regions emerge from the leucine zipper. The other corresponds to a localized nonhelical segment that has been hypothesized to contain an N-cap and facilitate the sharp angulation necessary for the basic region to track continuously in the major groove of DNA.\r"

Antiphospholipid antibodies and lupus anticoagulants are the most frequently identified acquired states associated with ischemic stroke. Polycythemia vera, sickle cell anemia, sickle-C disease, and essential thrombocythemia are the major disorders of formed blood elements causing stroke. Special, step-wise screening for occult prothrombotic entities in stroke patients is recommended for young persons with stroke of uncertain cause, for those with prior venous thrombosis, for those with a family history of unusual thrombosis, and for those with no other explanation for recurrent stroke. Acquired, perhaps transient, abnormalities of platelets, coagulation inhibition, and fibrinolysis may contribute importantly to brain ischemia in synergy with other mechanisms, but at present these remain ill-defined. The contribution of prothrombotic diatheses to stroke is probably underrecognized and warrants further investigation.\r"

Empiric studies done by professionals from diverse backgrounds have shown that physicians who use educational strategies can be effective in gaining the cooperation of patients to follow their recommendations. The educational model that currently is most familiar to physicians and the one they use most frequently when educating patients is pedagogy, the theoretic basis for teaching children. Andragogy, a theoretic basis for teaching adults, is now being suggested by medical educators as an alternative model. To illustrate the clinical relevance and application of the andragogic approach, studies focusing on physician behaviors associated with behavioral measures of adherence were reviewed, analyzed, and categorized according to a framework called the \"ADULT\" model. Physicians in a postgraduate training program who have had exposure to this framework and have incorporated it into their practices report less difficulty functioning as patient educators. The systematic use of this approach can have a positive effect on patient adherence.\r"

The initial result of hyperestrogenism is the development of endometrial hyperplasia, which is reversible in most cases by appropriate hormonal therapy. Persistent stimulation eventually leads to atypical hyperplasia with nuclear atypia and invasive carcinoma. Because there is no cost-effective screening method for the detection of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma, it is essential to survey the high-risk population with appropriate diagnostic techniques. After diagnosis, therapy should be individualized based on pathologic findings (cell type and histologic grade) and extent of disease (International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians stage, depth of myometrial invasion, and pelvic and para-aortic lymph node status). Recent studies suggest that sex hormone receptors and nuclear DNA ploidy patterns provide useful prognostic information independent of histologic grade.\r"

Although the efficacy is good (77.4% to 100%) for the treatment of 1- to 2-cm stones in select patients, ESWL may require the assistance of adjuvant procedures in as many as 26% of patients and may need repeating in as many as 32% of patients. These represent more difficult situations in which larger, more numerous, or harder stones may be present and in which ureteral stones are manipulated before treatment. The predominant adverse effect of ESWL treatment is the microvascular disruption of the tissues through which the shock waves pass. In addition, the procedure is painful, with many patients requiring narcotic analgesia. Long-term complications such as the new onset of hypertension have occurred in as many as 8% of treated patients, but much speculation about the long-term effects remains.\r"

  ".W": "We applied an automated computer program capable of simultaneous geometric (through border detection) and densitometric quantitation of digital angiograms for evaluation of the results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in different phases of the same cardiac cycle. Digital subtraction coronary angiograms (DSA) of 28 patients who had undergone PTCA to a total of 30 lesions, were analyzed in diastole, in systole, and in the middle of the cardiac cycle to test the variability in coronary quantitation resulting from random frame selection relative to cardiac phase. Before PTCA there was a low degree of variation between measurements obtained from the same lesion in different phases of the cardiac cycle, in both geometric (coefficient of variation between cardiac phases = 4.2%) and densitometric (coefficient of variation between cardiac phases = 5.1%) quantitation. After PTCA, however, there was a wider variation of values in different cardiac phases, which predominated in the densitometric measurements (coefficient of variation between cardiac phases = 33.6%, compared to 20.6% for geometric measurements). There was less agreement between different post-PTCA phases in densitometry, and discrepancies as large as 47% could occur in densitometric evaluation of the stenotic areas when different phases of the cycle were used. We concluded that border detection or densitometric quantitation of the postangioplasty lumens is subject to greater variation resulting from random frame selection relative to cardiac phase, as compared to preangioplasty assessment. This variation predominates in densitometric quantitation, which seems to be dependent not only on the radiographic projection but also on the cardiac phase. The usefulness of densitometric techniques for the evaluation of PTCA results appears to be questionable.\r"

Fifty-four patients fulfilling the criteria for idiopathic VF, including 14 patients investigated at our institution, are described. The mean age of patients for studies that reported age data was 36 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2.5 to 1. Over 90% of the patients required resuscitation, while syncope due to nonsustained VF occurred in the rest. Diagnosis of VF was preceded by syncope in one fourth of the patients. Holter monitoring and exercise stress tests were often unrewarding. Available electrophysiologic data revealed a 69% inducibility rate of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias using nonaggressive protocols of ventricular stimulation in most cases. Induced tachyarrhythmias were poorly tolerated, and were mostly of polymorphic configuration. Class IA antiarrhythmic agents were highly effective in preventing reinduction of these arrhythmias. Available figures suggest an 11% rate of sudden death within 1 year of diagnosis. Appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy appears to improve prognosis. Reviewed data suggest that idiopathic VF represents an underestimated cause of sudden cardiac death in ostensibly healthy patients. An international registry of patients with idiopathic VF is warranted.\r"

These agents are effective in chronic stable angina and unstable angina. In chronic myocardial ischemia, the beta-blockers timolol, metoprolol, atenolol, and propranolol have cardioprotective effects, reducing overall mortality and the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction. Calcium channel blockers, which reduce myocardial oxygen demand and improve oxygen supply, are effective in the treatment of chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina, and unstable angina. Although calcium channel blockers generally have no effect or adverse effects when used as primary therapy for acute myocardial infarction, diltiazem (when used concomitantly with nitrates or beta-blockers) has been shown to reduce the incidence of reinfarction in patients after non-Q wave myocardial infarction.\r"

This article discusses the phenomena underlying the factors that produce spontaneous (non-effort-related) ischemia. These include local arterial phenomena, arterial plaques, endothelial phenomena, neural phenomena, and circadian patterns. The clinical spectrum of myocardial ischemia can be viewed as an interplay among supply, demand, local arterial reactivity, and acute plaque disruption. In addition, neural phenomena and circadian patterns of multiple cardiovascular phenomena combine to make the coronary circulation susceptible to an increased concentration of events in the morning hours, around the time of awakening. With this extension of our understanding of myocardial ischemia, we have reasonable assurance that methods of treatment will advance significantly in the near future.\r"

This strategy is appropriate for use with isosorbide dinitrate, as well as intravenous or transdermal nitroglycerin. Transmucosal nitroglycerin has not been associated with tolerance; the lack of such an effect may be a result of rapid increases and decreases in drug levels. In the future, sulfhydryl donors may also prove useful in prevention or reversal of nitrate tolerance.\r"

During the 1-yr follow-up, patients were assessed clinically every month, and flexible sigmoidoscopy with a rectal pinch biopsy specimen and laboratory data were carried out every 3 months. Two patients in the 5-ASA group chose to withdraw from the study, one relapsed, and 12 remained in remission. In the placebo group, one patient chose to withdraw, 11 relapsed, and three remained in remission. The cumulative remission rate at the 12th month was 92% in the 5-ASA group and 21% in the placebo group. Log rank test showed a significant difference in the relapse rate between the two groups (chi 2 = 14.26, p less than 0.001). No side effects were observed.

Endoscopy was carried out at baseline and at the end of treatment. We took biopsies from the gastric body (twice) and antrum (six times) at each endoscopy in order to determine grade and extent of gastritis and Helicobacter pylori colonization. Both treatments induced a marked regression of active gastritis (sucralfate group: p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.0001, respectively, in body and in antrum; sulglycotide group: p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively). Conversely, Helicobacter pylori colonization remained unchanged at the end of the treatments. At baseline, a close relationship was found between grade of active inflammation in each biopsy and Helicobacter pylori density. After therapy, the association was lost in each treatment group. These results suggest that there can be a remission of active gastritis in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia even without changes in Helicobacter pylori colonization. This result can be achieved by enhancing the protective properties of the gastric mucosa.\r"

In the patients with elevated plasma des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin levels, both immunoreactive prothrombin and des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin significantly increased in hepatoma tissues compared with non-cancerous liver tissue. On the other hand, no significant difference was observed in the endogenous vitamin K (K1, MK-4, MK7) concentrations between hepatoma and noncancerous portions, in either the cases with or without increase of plasma des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin.

The PBF/BW in healthy volunteers showed a log-normal distribution, while the distribution was irregular and showed two peaks in patients with cirrhosis. This irregular distribution was thought to reflect their complex physiopathological state. We next analyzed the relationship between PBF/BW and the data from hepatic function tests (serum albumin, total bilirubin, indocyanine green 15-min retention rate, and indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate) in 48 patients with liver cirrhosis. The patients were divided into four groups according to their portal blood flow: group A with a hepatofugal or stagnant portal blood flow, group B with a hepatopetal PBF/BW of less than 12 ml/min/kg, group C with a hepatopetal PBF/BW of 12 or more but less than 20 ml/min/kg, and group D with a hepatopetal PBF/BW of 20 ml/min/kg or more. Among patients with cirrhosis, group A showed the worst results in hepatic function tests, group D the second worst, and group C the best. The effective hepatic blood flow was thought to have decreased because of the development of extrahepatic portosystemic shunts in the patients in groups A and B, whereas it decreased because of the development of intrahepatic shunts in patients in group D. The results of hepatic function tests deteriorated as a consequence of the decrease in the effective hepatic blood flow.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the factors which determine the transmission level of falciparum malaria, entomological and parasitological surveys were conducted from October 1988 to February 1990 in Manarintsoa in the central highland plateaux of Madagascar. Mosquitoes were collected for 928 man-nights in pit shelters and indoor resting sites. Malaria vectors were Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus, with no evidence of the presence of An. gambiae sensu stricto. Vectors were mainly exophilic and zoophilic. The index of stability was less than 1.5. The sporozoite rate was 0.11 for An. gambiae sensu lato and 0.47 for An. funestus. The transmission level was low, with an inoculation rate of 0.91 infective bites/person/year and an infection risk of 0.62. Malaria transmission occurs 7 months of the year in this area, from November to May. Human parasite rates fluctuated from 29% in October to 53% in May.\r"

Both were applied to plasmas of (a) acute patients, (b) people living in malarious areas, (c) blood donors at risk (travelers), and (d) sedentary blood donors without risk. With 1 of the 2 combinations, the percentage of positive answers was 68.4% (n = 38) for a, 62.6% (n = 206) for b, 4.5% (n = 398) for c, and 0.8% (n = 485) for d; with the other combination, the percentage of positive answers was 68.4% for a, 46.1% for b, 1.5% for c, and 0% for d. Using 2 combinations simultaneously, the positive results were 94.7% for a, 70.4% for b, 5% for c, and 0.8% for d. The 2 assays are complementary and the pair can be used for maximum Plasmodium falciparum antigen recognition in prospective donors.\r"

Of the mosquitoes collected, 7,244 (67%) of the An. gambiae s.l. and 8,511 (87%) of the An. funestus were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the presence of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite (CS) protein. ELISA positivity rates were 8.2% for An. gambiae s.l. and 6.1% for An. funestus. Both An. gambiae and An. arabiensis were detected among 432 ELISA-positive and 668 ELISA-negative An. gambiae s.l. identified to species with a ribosomal DNA probe. The species-specific infection rates were calculated to be 9.6% for An. gambiae and 0.4% for An. arabiensis. These results confirm that An. gambiae and An. funestus are the primary malaria vectors in western Kenya and that An. arabiensis is a relatively minor vector.\r"

The immunofluorescence (IF) test was used to detect specific IgG (IF-IgG). The patients were from an outbreak of trichinellosis in Salsomaggiore (northern Italy) in 1986. The parasite was isolated and isoenzymatically typed as Trichinella sp. 3. The specificity of our tests was greater than 95%. During the 1st period of infection, all tests used gave practically the same positivity rate (78.2-86.9%). One year after infection, ELISA-IgG gave the highest positivity rate (55%). With the other tests, the positivity rate was 20-38.5%. At the 2nd month of infection, the IF-IgG test was the most discriminating in patients with confirmed and suspected trichinellosis, but ELISA-IgG proved the most reliable test for detecting specific immunoglobulins in late human trichinellosis infection.\r"

Identification of the infected cell receptor sites may also lead to novel methods for treatment of acute cerebral malaria.

Knobs which appear on the membrane of the infected erythrocytes adhere to the endothelium, causing the obstruction of cerebral microvessels. Protein molecules such as CD36, thrombospondin, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, which are present on the membrane of endothelial cells, may act as receptors for the attachment of knobs of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Each of these candidate host molecules for infected-cell recognition and attachment are expressed in microvessels of the human brain. The presence of HRP1 and HRP2 in the cerebral microvessels of cerebral malaria patients may indicate the involvement of knob proteins in the pathogenesis of cerebral malaria. Owl monkeys infected with P. falciparum do not develop cerebral malaria. There is no blockage of cerebral microvessels by infected erythrocytes and knob proteins are absent. These findings support the contention that cerebral microvessel blockage and the presence of knob proteins are the probable causes of cerebral malaria.\r"

Sequestration protects infected erythrocytes from destruction in the spleen and contributes to the pathogenesis of severe and complicated malaria. The use of in vitro parasite culture and cytoadherence assays that measure the binding of infected erythrocytes to target cells has enabled the identification of host proteins that are putative receptors to which infected erythrocytes bind. Three such receptors have been identified: the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin, the leukocyte differentiation antigen CD36, and the intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1. Infected erythrocytes can bind in vitro to each of these proteins. Thrombospondin and CD36 bind to one another, but each also binds to infected erythrocytes independently. Triggering of the CD36 receptor on platelets and monocytes activates these cells in vitro, and stimulation of endothelial cells with cytokines that upregulate ICAM-1 expression can increase the binding of infected erythrocytes to endothelial cells. Studies of these and perhaps other host receptors to which infected erythrocytes bind may contribute to our understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms in malaria.\r"

After informed consent was obtained, a CIP and, within twenty-four hours, a venography of the symptomatic lower limb were performed in each patient. The results of CIP were compared with the results of contrast venography, which was considered as the gold standard. As far as the diagnosis of both proximal and distal DVT was concerned, the accuracy of CIP was 88.5%; the sensitivity and specificity were 95.1% and 83.6%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 81.2% and 95.8%, respectively. When the diagnosis of only proximal deep vein thrombosis was considered, the accuracy of CIP was 88.8%; the sensitivity and specificity were 97.1% and 83.6%, respectively; the positive and negative predictive values were 79.0% and 97.8%, respectively. The authors conclude that the newly developed CIP has a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of traditional impedance plethysmography. Moreover, being completely automated and portable, CIP can play an important role in the bedside diagnosis of DVT.\r"

Furthermore, a possible change in peripheral vascular tone was provoked by hyperventilation. The walking distance rose after both verapamil (40%) and placebo (31%) (p less than 0.01 for both) but tended to increase only after verapamil (7%) as compared with placebo. Blood pressure fell equally after both verapamil and placebo (p less than 0.05 for both). Verapamil did not influence the ankle-branchial blood pressure index. No signs of vasoactivity in the lower extremities were seen after hyperventilation. Although the greatest individual improvements in walking distance were seen after verapamil administration, it was not possible to predict positive responders among the patients.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred twenty-six patients with clinically suspected acute deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity (DVT) were examined comparatively with ultrasound and venography. In total, 174 lower extremity venograms were obtained. Ultrasonic examinations were performed on patients in the supine position. The venous segments were evaluated almost exclusively with transversal scanning. In the thigh, the only criterion for DVT was the reduced or absent compressibility of the venous lumen when gently compressed with the transducer. In the calf, normal unobstructed veins can usually not be viewed in the supine patient, whereas thrombotic veins appear as sonolucent, incompressible channels. Eight-three of the 174 lower extremity venograms were positive for DVT. In the majority of cases (53 of 83) the thrombotic process had involved two or more segments in combination. The sites of involvement of the different venous segments were distributed as follows: 24 occlusions of the common femoral vein, 52 of the superficial femoral vein, 56 of the popliteal vein, and 71 of the calf veins. Ultrasound had a sensitivity of 100% for thrombosis of the common femoral vein, 96% for the superficial femoral veins, 98% for the popliteal vein, and 93% for the calf veins. For the entire lower extremity, in regard to the diagnosis of thrombosis, the overall sensitivity was 95%. In 90% the extension of the occlusion was foreseen correctly. In no cases were false-positive results reported. Thus the overall specificity was 100%. The authors conclude that real-time ultrasound is a highly accurate method for the diagnosis of DVT of the lower extremity. It is the only indirect method capable of evaluating the venous system of the thigh, as well as that of the calf, with high accuracy. It should be the first choice of diagnostic imaging method in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremity.\r"

The signals from patients with old myocardial infarction (MI, N = 7) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD, N = 1) were amplified and passed through a bandpass (100-300 Hz) filter. The departure maps, LP isopotential maps, and LP30 area maps were generated and superimposed. The LP30 duration was determined as the section between the filtered QRS endpoints and points thirty milliseconds (ms) before. Isopotential maps of the LPs showed distinct positive and negative regions. In 7 cases with MI, the extreme was related to the zones indicated by the departure maps, and the LP30 area maps also corresponded to the departure areas. In 1 case of ARVD, endocardial fragmented activity directly recorded at the right ventricle closely corresponded with the region on the LP30 area map. In conclusion, body surface LP isopotential maps and LP30 area maps may provide useful information concerning the spatial distribution of endocardial fragmentation.\r"

Seventy-six patients were enrolled; three were excluded from analysis due to incomplete data. Thirty-four patients were randomized to receive antacid and 39 to receive GI cocktail. Patients rated their baseline pain at 6.4 +/- 2.8 cm in the antacid group and 6.7 +/- 2.7 cm in the cocktail group (P greater than .50). Improvement in pain score with treatment was 0.9 +/- 2.9 cm in the antacid group compared with 4.0 +/- 3.4 cm in the GI cocktail group (P less than .0001). Assessment of pain relief using a five-point rating scale also indicated greater relief with GI cocktail therapy compared with antacid alone (P = .004). No adverse effects were noted with either treatment. We conclude that a single dose of antacid and viscous lidocaine provides a significantly greater degree of immediate pain relief than antacid alone in patients with dyspepsia.\r"

In vitro, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for fluconazole was greater than 80 micrograms/ml, for SCH39304 40 micrograms/ml, and for amphotericin B 0.29 micrograms/ml. Beginning 1 day after challenge, groups of 10 mice were treated orally, twice daily, for 15 days with Noble agar (control), SCH39304, fluconazole, or amphotericin B at various doses. For lung tissue counts of A. fumigatus, mice were similarly challenged and treated only for 5 days with SCH39304, fluconazole, or amphotericin B. Only SCH39304 significantly reduced the number of A. fumigatus in the lung. SCH39304 at doses of 5 mg/kg or higher significantly prolonged the survival of mice, as did amphotericin B at 3 mg/kg. Fluconazole did not significantly prolong survival at doses of 15 or 30 mg/kg. SCH39304 appears to be as effective as amphotericin B in murine pulmonary aspergillosis and warrants further evaluation for aspergillosis in humans.\r"

The risk and prognosis factors for developing NP during MV were studied using both univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. Multivariate analysis selected the following variables significantly associated with a higher risk for developing ventilator-associated pneumonia: more than one intubation during MV (p = 0.000012), a prior episode of aspiration of gastric content (p = 0.00018), a MV period longer than 3 days (p = 0.015), the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p = 0.048), and the use of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) during MV (p = 0.092). The presence of an ultimately or rapidly fatal underlying disease (p = 0.0018), worsening of acute respiratory failure caused by pneumonia (p = 0.0096), the presence of septic shock (p = 0.016), an inappropriate antibiotic treatment (p = 0.02), and the type of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization (noncardiac surgery and nonsurgical ICU compared with post-cardiac surgery ICU) (p = 0.08) were those factors selected by a stepwise logistic regression analysis as independently worsening the prognosis. The overall fatality rate was 23% (73 of 322). The mortality of patients with NP was higher (33%; 26 of 78; p less than 0.01) when compared with fatality rates of patients without NP (19%; 47 of 244).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to inhaled histamine has often been cited as the gold standard in asthma diagnosis, but recently this has been questioned. This report assesses the relationship of BHR to asthma symptoms and asthma diagnosis in a large community-based sample of children. A total of 2,053 children 7 to 10 yr of age were randomly sampled from Auckland primary schools and assessed by a questionnaire and histamine inhalation challenge. In all, 14.3% had had asthma diagnosed, 29.6% reported having had one of the four respiratory symptoms in in the previous 12 months, and 15.9% had BHR (PD20 less than or equal to 7.8 mumol histamine). After a cumulative dose of 3.9 mumol histamine, the percent change in FEV1 from postsaline FEV1 was unimodally distributed, with those in whom asthma had been diagnosed dominating the severe end of the spectrum. However, 53% of those with BHR had no asthma diagnosis, and 41% had no current asthma symptoms. On the other hand, 48% of all subjects with diagnosed asthma and 42% of children with diagnosed asthma and current symptoms did not have BHR. Although severity of BHR tended to increase with wheezing frequency, all grades of severity (including no BHR) were found for any given frequency of wheeze. An existing diagnosis of asthma identified symptomatic children more accurately than did BHR, regardless of the criteria used for BHR or for \"symptomatic\" and irrespective of ethnic group. In conclusion, BHR is related to, but not identical to, clinical asthma. Bronchial challenge testing is an important tool of respiratory research, but cannot reliably or precisely separate asthmatics from nonasthmatics in the general community.\r"

In the present study, evaluating efficacy and possible development of tachyphylaxis after SM, 12 patients with stable asthma were included after the demonstration of reversibility in FEV1 of at least 15% to 200 micrograms salbutamol (SB) or 20% to 500 micrograms SB. At inclusion all patients were receiving treatment with inhaled beta 2-agonists, and 11 of the 12 patients were also receiving inhaled corticosteroids. The patients were treated for two 2-wk periods with either inhaled SM 50 micrograms twice a day or SB 200 micrograms four times a day, following a double-blind, double-dummy, randomized design. The treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 1 wk. Dose-response curves to inhaled SB were obtained the day before and the day after each treatment period. On each of these days, basal FEV1, tremor, heart rate, and blood pressure were recorded and were then followed after the inhalation of 100 + 300 + 900 micrograms SB to obtain a cumulative dose-response curve. During the treatment periods, as well as during the washout week after each treatment, the patients recorded their morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) each day before the inhalation of the study drug. Subjective asthma symptoms were monitored by a visual analog scale after each treatment period. The dose-response curves to SB revealed no signs of a reduced response to SB after any of the treatments, but significant increases in basal FEV1 and FVC were seen after the SM period (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the hypothesis that furosemide inhibits indirect bronchoconstrictor challenges by altering airway epithelial ion transport, we studied its effects on indirect bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled metabisulfite (MBS) and nasal potential difference (PD) in seven subjects with mild asthma. Its effect on direct bronchoconstriction by the inhaled muscarinic agonist methacholine (MC) was studied in six of these subjects. Each subject inhaled furosemide, 30 mg, in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled fashion immediately before challenge with MBS (0.3 to 160 mg/ml in increasing doubling concentrations) and, in another study, MC (0.125 to 32 mg/ml) aerosols from a nebulizer attached to a dosimeter. PC20MBS and PC20MC, the concentration of each agent needed to lower FEV1 by 20%, were calculated by linear interpolation of the log dose-response curves. Furosemide had no effect on resting lung function, but it caused a significant threefold reduction in sensitivity to MBS (PC20MBS: GM +/- GSEM, 15.1 +/- 1.6 mg/ml after placebo and 40.7 +/- 1.7 mg/ml after furosemide; p less than 0.001) with a protective index of 64.8 +/- 10.7%. Furosemide caused no change in sensitivity to MC (PC20 MC:GM +/- GSEM, 2.37 +/- 1.61 mg/ml after placebo and 2.19 +/- 1.751 mg/ml after furosemide; NS). In a third study, furosemide, 30 mg, and placebo were inhaled through the nose in a randomized double-blind fashion immediately prior to inhalation of a PC20 concentration of MBS through the nose. Nasal PD was measured before and after placebo or furosemide, and again after MBS inhalation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of oxidant inhalation on allergic illness is of interest because allergic patients often report increased respiratory symptoms during episodes of poor air quality, and epidemiologic studies demonstrate an association between increased levels of the air pollutant ozone and exacerbations of asthma. The purpose of this study was to characterize the upper respiratory response to ozone inhalation in asymptomatic, allergic subjects and to determine whether ozone pre-exposure increased the acute response to nasal challenge with antigen in these subjects. A group of 12 asymptomatic subjects with a history of allergic rhinitis were exposed in a randomized, cross-over design, at rest, on each of 2 days, separated by 2 wk, to 4 h of clean air or 0.5 ppm ozone in an environmental chamber. Following the exposure period, subjects underwent nasal challenge with four doses of antigen (1 to 1,000 PNU ragweed or grass). Symptoms were rated and nasal lavage performed after each dose. Measurement of histamine and albumin concentration and TAME-esterase activity and determination of cell counts and differentials were performed. Exposure to ozone caused significant increases in upper and lower respiratory symptoms, a mixed inflammatory cell influx with a sevenfold increase in naval lavage neutrophils, a 20-fold increase in eosinophils, and a tenfold increase in mononuclear cells, as well as an apparent sloughing of epithelial cells. There was a significant increase in nasal lavage albumin concentration on the ozone exposure day and a small increase in nasal lavage histamine concentration on both the ozone and clean air exposure days. TAME-esterase activity showed no significant increase overall, but increased at least twofold in 5 of 12 subjects. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Smokers in Group 1 received 900 international units of Vitamin E (VE) daily for 6 wk, whereas 40 mg of beta-carotene (BC) daily was administered to those in Group 2 for the same period. Subjects in Group 3 were treated with a matched placebo. Plasma levels of VE and BC as well as circulating leukocyte counts, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), and the luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (LECL) responses of blood phagocytes activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and FMLP with cytochalasin B (FMLP/CB) were measured prior to the administration of the antioxidant/placebo after 4 and 6 wk of supplementation and 12 wk after cessation of treatment. SCEs and leukocyte counts remained unchanged throughout the trial in all three treatment groups. Administration of VE for 4 wk was accompanied by decreased FMLP/CB-activated (p less than 0.005) and PMA-activated (p less than 0.005) LECL responses. However, with PMA as stimulant, the inhibition of LECL was transient, with partial recovery observed after 6 wk despite continued administration of VE. Administration of BC was associated with progressive inhibition of both FMLP/CB-activated (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01 after 4 and 6 wk, respectively) and PMA-activated (p less than 0.025 after 6 wk) LECL. No alterations in LECL responses were observed in Group 3 (placebo). VE appeared to inhibit the generation of oxidants by activated phagocytes, whereas BC scavenged oxidants generated by the myeloperoxidase/H2O2/halide system.\r"

I. Du Pont de Nemours, Wilmington, Del) for the recovery of these organisms. The blood culture records were reviewed, and the proportion of positive blood cultures yielding less than 1 colony-forming unit per milliliter of M avium-intracellulare or C neoformans was calculated. To determine consistency, a period of potentially detectable septicemia was defined as the period between 1 week before the first positive blood culture and the last positive blood culture, providing consecutive positive blood cultures were separated by less than 2 weeks. All positive and negative blood cultures obtained during the period of potentially detectable septicemia were considered in the data analysis. Overall, 40 (16.9%) of 236 cultures positive for M avium-intracellulare and 36 (57.1%) of 63 for C neoformans yielded less than 1 colony-forming unit per milliliter. Mycobacteremia was detected in 52 of 57 periods of potentially detectable septicemia in the first culture and in 56 of 57 in the first two (cumulative detection rates of 91.2% and 98.2%, respectively). Cryptococcemia was detected in 12 of 17 periods of potentially detectable septicemia in the first culture and in 15 of 17 in the first two (cumulative detection rates of 70.6% and 88.2%, respectively). Because of the sensitivity of the blood culture system and the consistency of M avium-intracellulare bacteremia and C neoformans fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, it appears that two blood cultures are sufficient for the detection of most septic episodes caused by these organisms.\r"

However, the phenotypic attributes of the small-cell population in this neoplasm have not been well characterized, and its relationship to \"precartilage mesenchyme\" remains unclear. In an attempt to address this issue, we performed an immunohistochemical analysis of nine cases, using antibodies to vimentin, S100 protein, Leu-7 antigen, neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, desmin, muscle-specific actin, cytokeratin, and epithelial membrane antigen, and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) method. The small cells of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma failed to express S100 protein, whereas all components of the tumors (small cells, lacunar chondroblasts, and chondroid matrix) stained for Leu-7 antigen in six cases. Neuron-specific enolase was identified in the small cells of four cases and in the lacunar cells of seven. None contained desmin, actin, cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, or synaptophysin. The immunophenotype of mesenchymal chondrosarcoma resembled that of embryonic cartilage and thus did not contradict the premise that this tumor was the neoplastic counterpart of fetal chondroid tissues. However, immunohistologic studies are not overly helpful in the differential diagnosis between mesenchymal chondrosarcoma and other small round cell lesions.\r"

The latter included (1) partially developed media; (2) two layers of the media separated by a well-formed internal elastic membrane; (3) total or partial disarray of the muscle coat; and (4) partial absence of the media. Previously described large capillaries proved to be postcapillary venules by virtue of having a distinct muscular layer. Serial sectioning indicated that the previously described \"polypoid projections\" of the media are mostly artifacts and the concept of \"arterialization of veins in arteriovenous malformations\" could not be substantiated. The actin method proved to be a useful adjunct to the conventional stains for accurate and selective detection of smooth-muscle cells.\r"

Removal of either CD8+ or CD4+ lymphocyte markedly decreased the spontaneous in vitro production of polyclonal IgG and of antigen-specific (anti-double-stranded DNA and antinucleoprotein) antibodies by SLE peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The CD8+ lymphocytes that sustained IgG production were CD3+, HLA-DR+, and their activity was abrogated by preincubation with anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody. When both CD4+ and CD8+ cells were removed, the readdition of either subset partially restored polyclonal IgG production, but both cell subsets were required to reconstitute autoantibody production. Purified SLE B cell cultures, which generated only 15% of the IgG produced by unseparated PBMC, were fully reconstituted only by mixtures of CD4+ with CD8+ cells, and with CD8-, CD4-, CD16+ cells. At least part of the support for spontaneous IgG production can be attributed to endogenous interleukin-2 and interleukin-6.\r"

Twenty-eight patients with myositis and serum translation-related autoantibodies anti-Jo-1, anti-PL-7, anti-PL-12, anti-KJ, and anti-SRP were studied for HLA class II specificities by Southern blotting with HLA-DR beta, DQ beta, and DQ alpha probes. The association of HLA-DR3 (DRw17) with anti-Jo-1 antibodies in white myositis patients was confirmed (P = 0.003, relative risk 8.9). However, HLA-DRw52 haplotypes, regardless of subtype, were present in all of the white and black patients with serum anti-Jo-1 and other translation-related autoantibodies. Moreover, one anti-Jo-1 positive patient had HLA-DRw8, an HLA-DRw52 haplotype on which the DR beta 3 gene has been partially deleted. No HLA-DQ specificity or allele was common to all patients. The HLA-DR3, DR5, DRw6, and DRw8 haplotypes, which bear the HLA-DRw52 specificity, share the most homology in the DR beta 1 first hypervariable region at amino acid positions 9-13. Thus, this DR beta 1 region appears to be the most likely candidate \"epitope\" for translation-related autoimmune responses in inflammatory myositis.\r"

Based on clinical and histologic criteria, 15 of these 53 patients were classified as having systemic necrotizing vasculitis of the polyarteritis group, 11 patients were classified as having Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and 14 were classified as having idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis. The remaining 13 patients did not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for these disorders, although most of these patients had clinical symptoms compatible with these disorders. While all patients with WG had renal involvement, only 4 of the 15 patients with systemic necrotizing vasculitis of the polyarteritis group had glomerulonephritis. The sensitivity of autoantibodies to MPO for either systemic necrotizing vasculitis of the polyarteritis group, WG, or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis was further tested in all our patients with these disorders (n = 104). Twenty-seven of 104 patients had autoantibodies to MPO. Furthermore, 69 of the remaining 77 patients had autoantibodies specific for the 29-kd serine protease, which has been reported to be specifically associated with WG. Sera from 8 patients were negative for either of these antibodies (92% sensitivity of autoantibodies to MPO and/or the 29-kd serine protease). The specificity of autoantibodies to MPO for either systemic necrotizing vasculitis of the polyarteritis group, WG, or idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis was also tested in selected groups of patients who had closely related diseases. Two of 144 patients had autoantibodies to MPO (specificity 99%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Of these 32 MAbs, 20 reacted with p26 and the other MAbs recognized p15 of the HIV-2[GH-1] isolate. From the results of serological characterization by these MAbs, p26 and p15 were identified as capsid proteins and matrix protein, respectively, of HIV-2[GH-1] gag products. In addition to two gag proteins, a 55-kD protein corresponding to the primary translational product of gag gene and 39-kD protein corresponding to an intermediate product of cleavage of p55 were recognized by these MAbs in the lysate of HIV-2[GH-1]-infected cells. Moreover, these MAbs were used to analyze the number of antigenic epitopes on p26 and p15 of HIV-2[GH-1] isolate. The results of cross-reactivity with different HIV-1, HIV-2, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates and competitive binding assay suggest that there are at least four and five antigenic epitopes in p26 and p15, respectively, of the HIV-2[GH-1] isolate. The biological activity of MAbs was studied by performing syncytium inhibition assay and infection inhibition assays. However, our MAbs could not inhibit syncytium formation and infection by cell-free virus.\r"

  ".W": "Mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against the transmembrane proteins of HIV-1 or HIV-2 provided site-directed, unambiguous discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody-positive sera, when employed in immunoassays as competitive probes against serum antibodies. These monoclonal antibodies mapped to epitopes outside of the well-characterized immunodominant regions (IDR) of the transmembrane proteins. The monoclonal competitive immunoassay was a superior method for discrimination compared with immunoprecipitation of metabolically radiolabeled HIV envelope glycoproteins, Western blot against viral envelope glycoproteins, or noncompetitive enzyme immunoassays employing HIV recombinant transmembrane proteins or synthetic IDR peptides as serological targets. The monoclonal competitive assay was not affected by antigenic cross reactivity or nonspecific reactivity exhibited by selected serum samples toward envelope proteins or peptides, respectively. Results of the monoclonal competitive immunoassay were supported by results of a peptide inhibition assay employing free IDR peptides in competition with IDR peptides on a solid support for binding of serum antibody. IDR peptide inhibition clearly demonstrated non-cross-reactive antigenic specificity of sera toward either the HIV-1 IDR or the HIV-2 IDR. The monoclonal competitive assay also identified samples containing antibody to both HIV-1 and HIV-2 transmembrane proteins. Analysis of these samples by IDR peptide inhibition indicated they contained two distinct, non-cross-reactive populations of antibodies, one directed to the HIV-1 IDR and the other directed to the HIV-2 IDR.\r"

We demonstrate that DMP inhibited transactivation directed by tat protein, which is a metal containing transcriptional transactivating factor and also interfered with viral production. Furthermore, treatment and pretreatment of cells with DMP strongly reduced their sensitivity for HIV-1 infection through unknown mechanisms. These results indicate that DMP reveals pleuripotent effects on HIV-1 infection and production in vitro and thus may provide an exploitable hypothesis for designing new drugs against AIDS.\r"

Of 29 HIV-1 antibody-positive sera, 6 reacted with decapeptides corresponding to the C-terminal amino acid sequence VEMGVEMGHHAPWDVDDL of the \"out\" (vpu) protein. This oligopeptide was synthesized by the solid phase method and used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for screening of 243 HIV-1-seropositive and 75 HIV-1-seronegative sera. It was found that 26% of the HIV-1 antibody-positive sera were reactive in the \"out\" (vpu) peptide ELISA, whereas none of the HIV-1-negative sera reacted with the oligopeptide. Correlation of reactivity of sera with the Walter Reed (WR) staging classification demonstrated that individuals classified WR 1 (36%) and WR 2 (42%) were more often reactive than patients classified WR 3-6 (11%).\r"

Eight out of 30 biopsies from patients with lichenoid lesions had linear C3 deposition at the basement membrane zone (BMZ); four of these patients had bullae and fulfilled the criteria for lichen planus pemphigoides. C9n immunoreactivity was detected as a linear or an intermittent linear/granular band at the BMZ only in these four patients, suggesting a role for the membrane attack complex of complement (MAC) in the pathogenesis of blister formation in lichen planus pemphigoides. Faint linear deposition of vitronectin, in addition to C9n, at the BMZ was seen in two of the four cases of lichen planus pemphigoides and three of six cases of bullous pemphigoid. This suggests that vitronectin may be deposited in association with C9n not only as part of the non-lytic SC5b-9 complex, but also as a regulatory step following the lytic action of MAC. A regulatory function for vitronectin in limiting tissue damage following activation of MAC is supported by our finding of a heavy deposition of vitronectin in association with C9n in a lichen planus pemphigoides patient in whom bulla formation had ceased.\r"

EGF receptors were seen in proliferating layers, where DNA replicating cells localize, but p21ras was found in the more differentiated layers.

There were differences between centres in the recording of patients' symptoms and disability, psoriasis type, and in the number of visits before discharge to general practitioners care. Both centres had a poor record of communication to general practitioners following patient default from the clinic. In both centres, the patient had only a one in 8 chance of subsequently being seen by a consultant if at the first visit they had been seen by a non-consultant.

The success rate is lower than the lowest reported, overall success rates for each cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and very much lower than cumulative term pregnancy rates for tubal surgery reported by most other authors. Patients with distal tubal occlusion but minimal adhesions had the best prognosis. Our results suggest that, provided in vitro fertilization is available, only those patients with good prognostic factors should undergo tubal surgery.

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To evaluate a structured, behavioural change, smoking cessation intervention designed for use within general practice. DESIGN--Randomised controlled clinical trial. SETTING--General practices in Newcastle, Australia. PATIENTS--311 Patients identified as smokers by a screening question were enrolled in the study. Of these, 101 were assigned to a structured behavioural change programme, 104 to a simple advice programme adapted from previous research, and 106 to a control group. No significant differences were found between groups for demographic and smoking related variables before the study. INTERVENTIONS--Patients in the simple advice group received a brief statement of advice from the general practitioner as well as three pamphlets; those in the structured intervention group were given strategies which included attitude and behavioural change programmes as well as techniques to aid compliance. The amount of smoking in all groups was assessed by self reports with validation by measurement of salivary cotinine concentrations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Significant increase in cessation rates. CONCLUSIONS--Significant differences between controls and the structured behavioural change group were found at the one month follow up, but only for self reported abstinence. The simple advice programme did not produce any significant differences over the control group. General practitioner evaluation of the structured programme highlighted difficulties in relation to the duration of the intervention. Overall the structured programme in its present form did not appear to be an effective programme for use within general practice.\r"
