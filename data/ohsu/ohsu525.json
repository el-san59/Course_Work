  ".W": "Since the licensing of measles vaccine in 1963, the incidence of reported measles in the United States has declined to less than 2 percent of previous levels. To characterize the current epidemiology of measles in the United States, we analyzed measles outbreaks that occurred during 1985 and 1986. There were 152 outbreaks (defined as five or more cases related epidemiologically), which accounted for 88 percent of the cases reported during those two years. There were two major types of outbreaks: those in which most of the cases occurred among preschool-age children (those under 5 years of age) (26 percent) and those in which most of the cases occurred among school-age persons (those 5 to 19 years of age) (67 percent). The outbreaks among preschool-age children ranged in size from 5 to 945 cases (median, 13); a median of only 14 percent of the cases occurred in vaccinated persons, and a median of 45 percent of the cases were classified as preventable according to the current strategy. Outbreaks among school-age persons ranged in size from 5 to 363 cases (median, 25); a median of 60 percent of the cases occurred in vaccinated persons, and a median of only 27 percent of the cases were preventable. The outbreaks among preschool-age children indicate deficiencies in the implementation of the national measles-elimination strategy. However, the extent of measles transmission among highly vaccinated school-age populations suggests that additional strategies, such as selective or mass revaccination, may be necessary to prevent such outbreaks.\r"

  ".W": "We describe a focal epidemic of Lyme disease, which spread from a nature preserve and affected an adjacent community of permanent residents in coastal Massachusetts. The attack rate from 1980 through 1987 was 35 percent among 190 residents living within 5 km of the nature preserve and was greatest (66 percent) among those living closest to the preserve. The risk of infection bore little relation to sex or age. Late Lyme disease, which clustered near the preserve, occurred mainly in residents infected early in the epidemic who did not have a history of erythema migrans and did not receive antibiotic therapy. All the residents with serologic evidence of infection had early or late clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, or both, during the period of study. The seasonal risk of infection was bimodal--greatest in June, with a secondary peak in October--and corresponded to periods of increased transmission. In the nature preserve, the density of the vector tick, Ixodes dammini, exceeded that in other New England sites. The zoonosis rapidly became endemic, and the severity of its impact correlated with the abundance of deer. This epidemic of Lyme disease demonstrated that outbreaks can be focal and can spread rapidly within a community of permanent residents.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the acquisition and transmission of Clostridium difficile infection prospectively on a general medical ward by serially culturing rectal-swab specimens from 428 patients admitted over an 11-month period. Immunoblot typing was used to differentiate individual strains of C. difficile. Seven percent of the patients (29) had positive cultures at admission. Eighty-three (21 percent) of the 399 patients with negative cultures acquired C. difficile during their hospitalizations. Of these patients, 52 (63 percent) remained asymptomatic and 31 (37 percent) had diarrhea; none had colitis. Patient-to-patient transmission of C. difficile was evidenced by time-space clustering of incident cases with identical immunoblot types and by significantly more frequent and earlier acquisition of C. difficile among patients exposed to roommates with positive cultures. Of the hospital personnel caring for patients with positive cultures, 59 percent (20) had positive cultures for C. difficile from their hands. The hospital rooms occupied by symptomatic patients (49 percent) as well as those occupied by asymptomatic patients (29 percent) were frequently contaminated. Eighty-two percent of the infected cohort still had positive cultures at hospital discharge, and such patients were significantly more likely to be discharged to a long-term care facility. We conclude that nosocomial C. difficile infection, which was associated with diarrhea in about one third of cases, is frequently transmitted among hospitalized patients and that the organism is often present on the hands of hospital personnel caring for such patients. Effective preventive measures are needed to reduce nosocomial acquisition of C. difficile.\r"

  ".W": "Rest homes have become a major component of the health care system for frail elderly persons and deinstitutionalized psychiatric patients. Although psychoactive medications are frequently used in rest homes, there is little detailed information about the extent of such use, its supervision, or its effects. In a survey of a random sample of 55 rest homes in Massachusetts, we found that 55 percent of the residents were taking at least one psychoactive medication. Antipsychotic medications were being administered to 39 percent; of these, 18 percent were receiving two or more such drugs. In a follow-up investigation, we studied 837 residents in 44 rest homes with particularly high levels of antipsychotic-drug use. About half the residents had no evidence of participation by a physician in decisions about their mental health during the year of the study. A third of the residents had performance deficits on mental-status testing that indicated serious cognitive impairment, although the causal relation of such impairment to medication use could not be determined. Six percent had evidence of moderate or severe tardive dyskinesia, probably as a side effect of medication. An assessment of staff competence revealed a low level of comprehension of the purpose and side effects of commonly used psychoactive drugs. We conclude that psychoactive drugs are widely used in rest homes, with little medical supervision or understanding by staff members of their possible side effects.\r"

Regardless of the subjects' status with respect to atopy or their age group, the prevalence of asthma was closely related to the serum IgE level standardized for age and sex (P less than 0.0001), and no asthma was present in the 177 subjects with the lowest IgE levels for their age and sex (greater than 1.46 SD below the mean). The log odds ratio increased linearly with the serum IgE level after we controlled for possible confounders and the degree of reactivity to skin tests. In contrast, allergic rhinitis appeared to be associated primarily with skin-test reactions to common aeroallergens, independently of the serum IgE level. We conclude that asthma is almost always associated with some type of IgE-related reaction and therefore has an allergic basis, although not all the allergic stimuli that cause asthma appear to have been included in the battery of common aeroallergens we used to assess atopic status. These findings challenge the concept that there are basic differences between so-called allergic (\"extrinsic\") and nonallergic (\"intrinsic\") forms of asthma.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the parathyroid hormone-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D) axis in osteoporosis by administering phosphate to 8 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (49 to 78 years old) and to 10 normal women matched for age (50 to 74 years). All subjects responded with a similar increase in the serum phosphorus concentration (women with osteoporosis, 1.15 +/- 0.06 to 1.79 +/- 0.09 mmol per liter; controls, 1.14 +/- 0.05 to 1.73 +/- 0.08 mmol per liter) and a fall in the ionized calcium concentration (women with osteoporosis, 1.12 +/- 0.03 to 1.06 +/- 0.03 mmol per liter; controls, 1.17 +/- 0.01 to 1.11 +/- 0.02 mmol per liter). Parathyroid hormone levels rose 2.5-fold in the control group (15.4 +/- 2.2 to 37.9 +/- 6.1 pg per milliliter) but increased by only 43 percent in the group with osteoporosis (14.8 +/- 2.8 to 21.2 +/- 4.1 pg per milliliter), an increase similar to that previously reported in young normal subjects (53 percent). In healthy older and younger subjects, the levels of 1,25(OH)2D did not change; in the subjects with osteoporosis, however, they decreased significantly (50 percent). We conclude that older women require a greater parathyroid hormone stimulus than younger women to maintain vitamin D homeostasis, because of an age-related decline in the formation of 1,25(OH)2D in response to parathyroid hormone, and that in osteoporosis the age-appropriate parathyroid hormone response to the same hypocalcemic signal is diminished. Our results are consistent with the presence of an abnormality in parathyroid hormone secretory function in osteoporosis in addition to the universal decline in 1,25(OH)2D responsiveness associated with aging.\r"

It can be converted to the less toxic urea, but this is a metabolically expensive process found only in terrestrial vertebrates that cannot readily excrete ammonia and marine fish that use urea as an osmotic filler. Freshwater fish mostly excrete ammonia with only a small quantity of urea. It seems the ornithine cycle for urea production has been suppressed in all freshwater teleosts except for some airbreathers which, when exposed to air, increase urea synthesis via the cycle. Here we show that the tilapia fish Oreochromis alcalicus grahami, the only fish living in Lake Magadi, an alkaline soda lake (pH = 9.6-10) in the Kenyan Rift Valley, excretes exclusively urea and has ornithine-urea cycle enzymes in its liver. A closely related species that lives in water at pH 7.1 lacks these enzymes and excretes mainly ammonia with small amounts of urea produced via uricolysis. It dies within 60 min when placed in water from Lake Magadi. We suggest that urea production via the ornithine-urea cycle permits O. a. grahami to survive the very alkaline conditions in Lake Magadi.\r"

These ideas are not yet empirically supported as data quantifying the relationship between female mate choice and female reproductive success are lacking. Only in one case, in Colias butterflies, has it been demonstrated unequivocally that females choose 'good genotypes' as mates and there is only one study, on Drosophila, demonstrating that mate choice increases one component of offspring fitness. Spur length of male pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) correlates with various fitness-related properties. We here present the first experimental field data showing that female pheasants select mates on the basis of male spur length and that female mate choice correlates with female reproductive success.\r"

Glutamate activates cation conductances that lead to membrane depolarization whereas GABA controls chloride conductances that produce hyperpolarization. Here we report that the GABAA-activated conductance in hippocampal pyramidal cells is enhanced by glutamate at concentrations below that required for its excitatory action. The GABA-potentiating effect can be induced, with comparable potency, by several glutamate analogues such as quisqualate, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), kainate and, surprisingly, by D-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV), an antagonist for NMDA receptors. Data from dose-response curves show that glutamate enhances the GABAA conductance without significantly changing GABA binding affinity. The low concentration of glutamate needed to enhance GABAA responses raises the possibility that glutamate modulates the strength of GABA-mediated transmission in the cortex.\r"

RNase protection assays have shown that this AChR-inducing activity (ARIA) increases the amount of mRNA encoding the alpha-subunit of the AChR, with little or no effect on the amounts of gamma- and delta-mRNAs2. Here, we report that the mRNAs encoding the alpha- and gamma-subunits of the receptor detected by in situ hybridization are concentrated around nuclei in cultured myotubes. Consistent with previous results, ARIA selectively increased the amount of alpha-subunit mRNA, but we now find that all nuclei were not activated to the same extent, with a substantial number not responding at all. Assuming that ARIA is released by motor nerve terminals, our results indicate that only a subset of muscle nuclei are capable of contributing to the accumulation of AChRs at developing neuromuscular junctions.\r"

  ".W": "Tissue position-dependent or address-dependent expression of cell adhesion molecules has been proposed to play a part in cellular positioning in a variety of systems, for example during neural development, the metastasis of neoplasms, and the tissue-specific homing of lymphocytes. The extravasation of blood-borne lymphocytes is regulated by interactions with the endothelium of specialised venules, such as the high endothelial venules (HEV) in organized lymph nodes and mucosal lymphoid tissues. At least three separate lymphocyte-HEV recognition systems have been described, one mediating tissue-selective lymphocyte interactions with HEV in peripheral lymph nodes, another in mucosal lymphoid organs, and a third in inflamed synovium. We have previously identified a tissue-specific 'vascular addressin' in the mouse which is selectively expressed by venules mediating lymphocyte-homing into mucosal tissues. To determine whether this addressin is a specific adhesion molecule for lymphocytes, we have isolated it by monoclonal antibody-affinity chromatography and inserted it into supported phospholipid planar membranes. Lymphocytes bind to membranes containing the addressin, but not to phospholipid bilayers or to control glycophorin-reconstituted membranes. Only those lymphocytes and lymphoma cell lines capable of binding to mucosal HEV adhere well to the isolated addressin; peripheral lymph node HEV-specific or HEV-non-binding cell lines do not bind. Binding is blocked by anti-addressin antibody MECA-367. We conclude that the mucosal vascular addressin is a tissue-specific endothelial cell-adhesion molecule for lymphocytes, and suggest that it could regulate lymphocyte traffic into mucosal tissues by mediating attachment of blood-borne cells to endothelium.\r"

We report the identification of the smaller component as beta 2-microglobulin. Association of beta 2-microglobulin with p51 was confirmed by crosslinking in intestinal epithelial cell brush borders. We have cloned a cDNA encoding the presumptive Fc-binding subunit, p51, and its predicted primary structure has three extracellular domains and a transmembrane region which are all homologous to the corresponding domains of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. This is the first time a function has been assigned to an MHC antigen-related molecule.\r"

The in vivo conformation of DNA is usually thought to be the B form, but there is recent evidence that other conformations may be important in DNA-protein recognition. Different fragments of DNA crystallized under virtually identical conditions can form A, B or Z helices. A fragment that adopted an A conformation in a crystal was found in the B conformation in solution, whereas NMR spectroscopy of A-DNA films revealed the presence of a substantial amount of disordered B-DNA. Until now, however, a DNA fragment of a given sequence has not been crystallized in more than one global conformation. We report here an X-ray diffraction study of crystals of the DNA octamer dGGBrUABrUACC. In addition to a 'framework' of A-DNA, which gives discrete X-ray reflections, there are partially disordered B-DNA helices, recognized by their diffuse scattering features.\r"

  ".W": "Like a number of plants, some mammals commonly produce more progeny than they can afford to rear, terminating investment in some or even all of their offspring once the resources available for breeding are known. Adaptive interpretations of juvenile wastage rely on the argument that the costs of gestation are small compared to those of feeding offspring. Though energetic evidence supports this conclusion, it is unsafe to assume that the relative costs of gestation and lactation to the mother's survival and future reproductive success follow the same pattern because lactation commonly coincides with the period of maximum food availability. Controlling for individual variation, we show that in wild red deer (Cervus elaphus L) any costs of gestation to the mother's subsequent survival and reproductive success are slight compared to those of lactation.\r"

  ".U": "89097273\r", 
  ".W": "It is now well established that pathogens such as viruses, fungi bacteria and protozoans can have profound effects on the dynamics of their invertebrate host populations. Theoretical models of invertebrate host-pathogen interactions which assume uniform structure of the pathogen population may reasonably explain the oscillatory behaviour observed in some systems, but do not adequately describe the existence of more constant populations found in other host-pathogen interactions. An examination of the literature relating to these relatively stable systems suggests that the common thread is the eventual transmission of some of the more protected, longer-lived stages of the pathogen occurring in reservoirs, such as the soil, host cadavers on trees, or the live host itself. In this letter, I propose a new theoretical model which incorporates this population structure and accounts for the range of dynamics observed in natural systems. In particular, I show that host populations may be regulated to low and relatively constant densities if sufficient numbers of pathogens are trans-located from pathogen reservoirs to habitats where transmission can occur. An understanding of pathogen reservoirs may be of value in the design of biological control programmes and may greatly increase the effectiveness of pathogens as biological control agents.\r"

The most well-known function of IFNs is their antiviral activity; viral infections result in induction of the transcription of the IFN-alpha and IFN-beta genes. Recently we isolated the gene encoding a transcription factor, IRF-1, that may play a part in the induction of IFN genes. Interestingly, the IRF-1 gene itself is virus-inducible, suggesting the importance of de novo production of IRF-1 in IFN gene induction. Here we show that high-level expression of the cloned mouse IRF-1 gene in monkey COS cells results in the induction of endogenous IFN-alpha and IFN-beta genes without viral stimulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the induction of these genes by an IRF-1/yeast GAL4 chimaeric transcription factor. This may be the first demonstration of the specific induction of silent chromosomal genes by transfection of a single transcription factor gene in mammalian cells.\r"

Nuclear proteins larger than relative molecular mass 20,000-40,000 are probably actively transported across the envelope through the nuclear pore complex and are directed by specific nuclear location sequences (NLS) in the proteins. NLS mediate the nuclear import of isolated nuclear proteins after microinjection into whole cells and the nuclear accumulation of chimaeric proteins or of non-nuclear proteins conjugated to synthetic peptides. The best-characterized NLS is the simian virus 40 large T-antigen sequence. We have identified two proteins of rat liver by chemical cross-linking that interact with a synthetic peptide containing this sequence: this interaction is specific for a functional NLS, is saturable, and high affinity. The binding proteins are present in a post-mitochondrial supernatant, in nuclei and in a nuclear envelope fraction, which is consistent with a role in the transport of nuclear proteins from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.\r"

  ".U": "89097281\r", 
  ".W": "In the traditional view of molecular evolution, the rate of point mutation is uniform over the genome of an organism and variation in the rate of nucleotide substitution among DNA regions reflects differential selective constraints. Here we provide evidence for significant variation in mutation rate among regions in the mammalian genome. We show first that substitutions at silent (degenerate) sites in protein-coding genes in mammals seem to be effectively neutral (or nearly so) as they do not occur significantly less frequently than substitutions in pseudogenes. We then show that the rate of silent substitution varies among genes and is correlated with the base composition of genes and their flanking DNA. This implies that the variation in both silent substitution rate and base composition can be attributed to systematic differences in the rate and pattern of mutation over regions of the genome. We propose that the differences arise because mutation patterns vary with the timing of replication of different chromosomal regions in the germline. This hypothesis can account for both the origin of isochores in mammalian genomes and the observation that silent nucleotide substitutions in different mammalian genes do not have the same molecular clock.\r"

Severe pattern deficiencies are observed that are restricted to a single body region, the trunk. The mutation may directly affect mesoderm, as somites do not form in the trunk. Head and tail structures, including tail somites, are relatively undisturbed. The earliest detected expression of the mutation is during gastrulation, when movements of mesodermal cells occur incorrectly. We injected prospective trunk mesodermal cells with lineage tracer dye and observed that in mutants these cells may enter a new body region, the tail, and there may express a new fate appropriate for the changed position.\r"

Biochemical analysis of the actions of NGF upon peripheral neurons has been hampered by the lack of a preparation of neuronal cells that are responsive to NGF but do not require it for survival. We report here that in adult dorsal root ganglion neurons, which can be isolated, enriched and maintained in culture in the absence of neuronal growth factors, the expression of mRNAs encoding the precursors of two neuropeptides, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide is regulated by NGF. Our results provide the first direct evidence of a continuous dynamic role for NGF in regulation of peptide neurotransmitter/neuromodulator levels in mature sensory neurons.\r"

In both insects and mammals, however, all the cells derived from a single spermatogonial cell develop within a common syncytium formed as a result of incomplete cytokinesis at each of the mitotic and meiotic cell divisions. It has been proposed that the intercellular bridges connecting the cells, which are about 1 micron in diameter, permit the sharing of cytoplasmic constituents, thus ensuring the synchronous development of a clone of cells and gametic equivalence between haploid spermatids. By analysing the product of a transgene which is expressed exclusively in post-meiotic germ cells in hemizygous transgenic mice, we have shown that genetically distinct spermatids share the product of the transgene and hence can be phenotypically equivalent.\r"

The retrotransposon family is thought to transpose through an RNA intermediate and has many similarities to vertebrate proretroviruses. In plants, retrotransposons have been described in maize, Arabidopsis and wheat, and non-viral retroposons in maize. Most of these elements, however, have been found as non-mobile integrated units. Here, we report the isolation of the first tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transposable element, Tnt1, which seems to be the most complete mobile retrotransposon characterized in higher plants. Tnt1 has been isolated after its transposition into the nitrate reductase (NR) structural gene of tobacco, and transposition events have been detected through in vitro selection of spontaneous NR-deficient (NR-) mutant lines in cell cultures derived from tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. Tnt1 is 5,334 nucleotides long, contains two 610-base-pair-long terminal repeats and a single open reading frame of 3,984 nucleotides. Comparison of the Tnt1 open reading frame coding potential with those of the Drosophila melanogaster copia retrotransposon, yeast Ty retrotransposon, and vertebrate proretroviruses revealed that Tnt1 is closely related to copia and carries all the functions known to be required for autonomous transposition by reverse transcription.\r"

  ".W": "It is generally accepted that chloroplasts arose from one or more endosymbiotic events between an ancestral cyanobacterium and a eukaryote. Such an origin fits well in the case of the chloroplasts of rhodophytes that, like cyanobacteria, contain chlorophyll a and phycobilin pigments. The green chloroplasts from higher plants, green algae, and euglenoids however, contain chlorophyll b as well as chlorophyll a, and lack phycobilins. Consequently, it has been suggested that they arose independently of the rhodophyte chloroplasts, from an ancestral prokaryote containing that complement of pigments. The 'prochlorophytes' Prochloron didemni (an exosymbiont on didemnid ascidians) and Prochlorothrix hollandica (a recently discovered, free-living, filamentous form) have been suggested to be modern counterparts of the ancestor of the green chloroplasts because they are prokaryotes that also contain both chlorophylls a and b, and lack phycobilins. We report here a 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic analysis of P. hollandica. The organism is found to fall within the cyanobacterial line of descent, as do the green chloroplasts, but it is not a specific relative of green chloroplasts. Thus, similar pigment compositions do not necessarily reflect close evolutionary relationships.\r"

One option, vaginal birth after one previous cesarean, has come to be recognized as an acceptable alternative to routine elective repeat cesarean delivery. The purpose of this report was to evaluate whether women with two previous cesareans can safely undergo a trial of labor. Between July 1, 1982 and June 30, 1986, data were collected prospectively on all women with previous cesareans. Those with a known classical incision or a medical or obstetric contraindication to a trial of labor were excluded from an attempted vaginal delivery. During this period, 67,784 patients were delivered, of whom 6250 (9.2%) had had a previous cesarean. Of the 6250 previous-cesarean patients, 1088 (17.4%) had had two previous cesareans; of these, 501 (46%) underwent a trial of labor and 346 (69%) delivered vaginally. Whereas the overall rate of uterine dehiscence was 3%, the rate in those women who attempted a vaginal delivery was 1.8%, versus 4.6% in those who did not. Overall, oxytocin was used in 284 (57%) and was associated with a dehiscence rate of 2.1%, versus 1.4% in the no-oxytocin group. Successful vaginal delivery was related significantly to the use of oxytocin and to a previous vaginal delivery. Trial of labor in patients with two previous cesareans appears to be a reasonable consideration.\r"

The availability of home uterine tocodynamometric systems permitted monitoring of uterine contractility for three 60-minute time periods related to coitus. A significant increase in uterine contractility in the immediate postcoital period was observed for the high-risk women, but not for the controls. This increased uterine activity subsided spontaneously within 2-3 hours, returning to baseline. These initial preliminary observations of uterine response to coitus in a home environment are interesting; however, further research is suggested to establish their clinical implications.\r"

Magnesium content of monthly blood samples was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Socioeconomic data and information on use of supplements, medicines, tobacco, and alcohol were obtained by interview and medical chart review. Erythrocyte magnesium levels in both groups remained stable during pregnancy, whereas plasma magnesium showed a slight decline (P less than .08). Plasma and erythrocyte magnesium did not differ significantly between the normal pregnant (N = 30) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (N = 12) groups. Overall, mean arterial pressure was not significantly related to plasma or erythrocyte magnesium values. Within the pregnancy-induced hypertension group, there was a slight (P less than .05) inverse relationship between mean arterial pressure and plasma magnesium. The two groups were similar for socioeconomic characteristics, gynecologic age, previous use of oral contraceptives, and use of tobacco and magnesium-containing supplements. Pregnancy-induced hypertension subjects reported more alcohol use than did normal pregnant subjects (P less than .02). In conclusion, there was no evidence of magnesium depletion among teens who developed pregnancy-induced hypertension, by measurement of erythrocyte or plasma magnesium.\r"

At birth, of the 74 newborns with normal electronic fetal heart rate (FHR) tracings, eight (11%) had an umbilical arterial pH less than 7.20. There was a significantly higher frequency of acidemia (defined as pH less than 7.20) in newborns with both baseline and periodic FHR abnormalities. Although there was a significant difference (P less than .05) in the frequency of meconium found below the cords in these neonates with an umbilical artery pH less than 7.20 compared with those with values exceeding 7.20, there was no significant difference in the frequency of clinical meconium aspiration syndrome.

As a private institution providing obstetric care to such a population of women, we undertook an anonymous HIV cord blood serosurvey to estimate the number of childbearing women at our institution at risk for perinatal transmission of the virus and to assess the success of our voluntary screening program to identify seropositive women. Between November 1987 and January 1988, cord blood samples from all clinic deliveries were analyzed for the presence of HIV antibody. For each sample obtained, the mother's age and site of prenatal care were known. Overall, 2.7% (six of 224) of the samples tested were seropositive; two of the 34 samples (5.9%) from teenage mothers were seropositive. All positive samples were from women who received prenatal care; none were identified through a voluntary screening program based on patient self-acknowledged risk-behavior assessment. This confirms that risk factor history elicited by personal interview is not a reliable screening tool for initiating HIV antibody counseling and testing. The high seropositive rate in teenagers is disturbing and needs further assessment.\r"

Ninety-two percent of the mothers felt fetal movements with the stimulus; all but three had a reactive non-stress test (NST). These three women were taking multiple antihypertensive drugs and were less than 33 weeks' gestation. Of 88 patients with no maternal perception of sound-provoked fetal movement, ten had nonreactive NSTs. Ultrasound confirmed the absence of fetal movement to the stimulus. The outcome in nine of these ten cases suggested some evidence of fetal compromise. Maternal perception of sound-provoked fetal movement correlated well with the results of the NST; the sensitivity (76.9%), specificity (92.8%), and negative predictive value (99.7%) were all high, although the positive predictive value was only 11.4%. Maternal perception of sound-provoked fetal movement may suffice as an inexpensive and simple method of evaluating antenatal fetal well-being in risk situations. When the mother is doubtful or does not feel the sound-provoked fetal movement, NST is indicated to evaluate the fetal health.\r"

Twenty-five nonfertilized IVF patients were compared with 57 successfully fertilized IVF patients. Patients were matched for age, ovulation-induction protocol, and cycle. The two groups were similar with respect to infertility etiology, peak estradiol, and total oocytes retrieved at laparoscopy. There was a greater incidence of primary infertility (64 versus 49%) and mean years of infertility (5.4 +/- 0.4 versus 4.6 +/- 0.3) in the nonfertilization group, although these differences were not statistically significant. Most important, the nonfertilization patients had a greater incidence of an atypical LH rise prior to hCG administration (60 versus 18%; P less than .001) and fewer mature oocytes (2.0 +/- 0.3 verus 3.4 +/- 0.3; P less than .01). Stepwise linear regression analysis yielded four primary factors for predicting fertilization failure: infertility duration, primary infertility, number of mature oocytes, and presence of LH rise. These findings help characterize several potential factors other than oligozoospermia that are associated with nonfertilization, and support LH monitoring in IVF and gamete intrafallopian tube transport patients.\r"

Complete follow-up was obtained for 1 year in 60 patients and through the first pregnancy in 64. The 70 patients were divided into three groups based on obstetric history prior to surgery: 1) 40 with only first-trimester losses, 2) 15 whose histories included second-trimester losses or premature delivery, and 3) 15 with primary infertility. Long-term follow-up indicated no significant gynecologic abnormalities. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative obstetric outcomes indicated the following: 1) Hysteroscopic metroplasty was very effective in treating patients with septa and a history of first-trimester abortion; 2) patients with first-trimester loss and either second-trimester abortion or preterm birth benefited from metroplasty but were still at risk for preterm labor; and 3) hysteroscopic metroplasty does not \"cure\" unexplained infertility. When compared with abdominal metroplasty for efficacy, morbidity, and cost, hysteroscopic metroplasty appears to be the treatment of choice in patients with uterine septa associated with pregnancy loss. Those patients with a history of second-trimester loss and third-trimester preterm delivery continue to require close monitoring in subsequent pregnancies.\r"

The risk of ectopic pregnancy in women with a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion was about fourfold that of controls (relative risk adjusted for age and number of pregnancies = 4.3; 95% confidence interval 1.4-14.7). This association was confirmed by comparing the observed number of extrauterine pregnancies in women with recurrent spontaneous abortions with the expected number computed from regional data on the frequency of ectopic pregnancies; the estimated relative risk was 3.7, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.2-7.0. The present report found an association between spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies, suggesting some common risk/etiologic factors for these two reproductive failures.\r"

Macroscopic evidence of the needle entry was found in 37 cases, including one giant hematoma of the cord. Within 48 hours after the procedure, microscopic examination of transverse sections taken at the puncture site revealed distinct perforation of the vessel wall, associated in four cases with a small hematoma encircling the vessel. One week after cordocentesis, the vessel wall was partially reformed. There were no histologic differences between needle entry in a vein or in an artery. No thromboses of the umbilical vessels were found.\r"

The fetus was paralyzed with pancuronium (0.3 mg/kg sonographic estimate of fetal weight) for diagnostic cordocentesis on 19 occasions (intravascularly in 17 and intramuscularly [IM] in two). Pancuronium (intravascularly in 16; IM in three) and furosemide (4 mg/kg intravenously) were administered during each transfusion. There were no significant differences between the first and second measurements for any of the three indices in the control group. Significant reductions were documented in the S/D ratio (P less than .0001), the pulsatility index (P = .043), and the resistance index (P less than .0001) after diagnostic cordocentesis. Pancuronium administration did not alter the magnitude of the decline, nor was there an association between the decline and the volume of blood removed. Significant relationships were observed between the magnitude of the decline and several respiratory blood gas measurements. As in the diagnostic cordocentesis group, there were significant reductions in each Doppler index after transfusion (S/D ratio, P = .003; pulsatility index, P = .002; resistance index, P = .0001). In addition, there was a significant relationship between gestational age and S/D ratio (r = 0.70, P = .002) in fetuses undergoing intravascular transfusion. The S/D ratio was most sensitive to changes in fetal oxygenation. We conclude that both diagnostic cordocentesis and intravascular transfusion as performed at the University of Iowa acutely lower the studied Doppler waveform indices.\r"

Diagnostic categories included uteroplacental insufficiency (N = 7) and uteroplacental insufficiency with associated fetal structural abnormality (N = 7), aneuploidy (N = 5), and congenital infection (N = 2). The mean (+/- 1 SEM) gestational age was 29.3 +/- 1 week. Compared with the control group matched for gestational age, the growth-retarded fetuses had higher hematocrits regardless of etiology. The platelet count was reduced in growth-retarded fetuses with aneuploidy (P less than .05). Leukopenia was observed in a fetus with congenital infection and in the group of fetuses with uteroplacental insufficiency unassociated with a structural abnormality (P less than .05). Leukocytosis was seen in growth-retarded aneuploid fetuses (P less than .01). The pH, pO2, and percent oxygen saturation were each lower in growth-retarded fetuses with either uteroplacental insufficiency or aneuploidy, and the pCO2 and bicarbonate were higher compared with controls (each P less than or equal to .05). Appropriately grown aneuploid fetuses had normal hematologic and respiratory blood gas measurements but were significantly more likely not to be trisomic (P = .04). Fetuses with uteroplacental insufficiency unassociated with a structural anomaly had significantly higher umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratios than both the control group (P = .0002) and the group with uteroplacental insufficiency and a structural anomaly (P less than .008). This investigation confirms previous studies of fetuses suffering uteroplacental insufficiency and extends the observations to other etiologies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine the accuracy, safety, and usefulness of fine-needle aspiration in this setting, we retrospectively reviewed pathologic and clinical data from 62 consecutive aspirates of inguinal lymph nodes in 48 gynecologic patients, of whom 42 had cancer. Aspirates from 37 patients yielded diagnostic material. Aspirated tumor cells consistently reflected the primary tumor histology. Tumors included carcinomas of the vulva, vagina, and cervix, and carcinomas and mixed mesodermal cancers of the corpus and ovary. Node excision and clinical observations provided adequate follow-up for 19 positive and 15 negative aspirates, and identified no false positives and two false negatives. The role of fine-needle aspiration varied with the tumor type and stage. It provided the first microscopic diagnosis of cancer in six patients and the first diagnosis of metastasis in six others. Decisions concerning surgery, radiation ports, and chemotherapy frequently depended on the results of fine-needle aspiration. There were no complications from the procedure. Fine-needle aspiration is an accurate, safe, and useful method for assessing clinically suspicious inguinal nodes.\r"

A mathematic relation was then derived to transform these measurements to the maximum resolutions that could have been obtained with radiographs under similar conditions. The results indicate that radiographs of rigid structures such as bones and teeth can be taken with reasonable resolution at exposure times much longer than normally used in clinical practice. It was also found that radiographs taken with the film rigidly fixed to the object being studied will exhibit remarkably less blurring from patient motion than radiographs taken when the patient and the film are not coupled. In addition it was found that motion artifacts are reduced to a minimum when the plane of the film is perpendicular to the radiation beam.\r"

A classification of disk shapes was devised by means of corrected lateral cephalometric arthrotomograms and histopathologic sagittal sections. Five basic shapes were identified: bow tie (normal), straight, funnel, bulge, and Y. Statistical analyses were performed. The normal condyle-disk-fossa relationship and slight-to-moderate disk displacement occurred with disk shape 1 (bow tie). Severe disk displacement without reduction occurred predominantly with disk shape 4 (bulge). Beaking of dye in the anterior recess of the inferior joint space was an indicator of abnormal disk morphology and displacement.\r"

  ".W": "Fifteen patients with temporomandibular joint disk displacement in whom a normal condyle-disk relationship could be established were treated with occlusal changes to maintain the disk in a recaptured position. Occlusal changes were achieved by prosthodontics in 11 patients and by orthodontics in four patients. Follow-up after about 3 years showed that joint function was improved, intensity of pain was reduced, and joint and muscle tenderness were less frequent than before treatment. Intermittent locking, use of analgesics, sleep disturbances, and absence from work because of temporomandibular joint symptoms were also less frequent. Radiographic examination performed in 11 patients at follow-up demonstrated anteroinferior condylar position in the majority of the patients, but only minor hard tissue changes. Arthrography showed the disk to be in a correct position relative to the condyle in 82% (9 of 11) of the patients. These results suggest that permanent change of the occlusion with the objective of eliminating abnormal disk position may be effective treatment for disk displacement when conventional methods of treatment have failed to alleviate the symptoms. The extent of dental treatment needed to maintain the disk in a correct position should, however, be considered relative to the severity of the symptoms.\r"

Although the cause remains obscure, a wide range of antigens and factors, including herpesvirus and other infections, has been suggested as triggering the disease. In the present study of 95 patients, we found that patients with oral involvement alone tend to predominate over those who have oral and lip, or oral, lip, and skin disease. There were also more women than men. Our study further confirmed that erythema multiforme cannot be characterized solely as a disease that is cyclical and self-limiting. The dramatic response to corticosteroids and to the immunoregulating agent levamisole, as well as the fact that patients with erythema multiforme are otherwise essentially healthy, suggests that erythema multiforme may be caused by a transient autoimmune defect, possibly triggered by multiple factors. Because 19 patients with oral candidiasis responded to antifungal therapy, a possible antigenic role for these organisms is suggested.\r"

Staining for PKK1-detectable keratin was absent in tumor epithelial cells and that with KL1 and TK immunoreagents was confined to squamous cells, being strong in the keratinized cells. In view of the results, the squamous odontogenic tumor appears to arise from the rests of Malassez in periodontal tissue rather than from oral squamous epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of two nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents--piroxicam and diclofenac--to control endodontic pain was compared with that of a placebo control in a double-blind study of 267 patients requiring endodontic therapy. Endodontic treatment was carried out over three visits with an interval of 5 to 7 days between each two consecutive visits. All patients were clearly instructed to take the medication only if they experienced pain, between the visits or postoperatively, for 3 consecutive days. The patients subjectively rated their pain on a scale of 1 to 4 as none, mild, moderate, or severe. The ratings were done preoperatively and at 2, 4 and 8 hours after the initial dose of medication was taken, as well as on the second and third days. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that both piroxicam and diclofenac significantly reduced the mean pain score at the end of all observations and were significantly superior to the placebo until the end of the study. More than 90% of the patients treated with piroxicam and more than 80% of the patients treated with diclofenac showed complete relief of pain. Overall, piroxicam was clearly more effective than diclofenac or the placebo. It provided more consistent relief of pain, beginning 2 hours after the initial dose, and it continued to do so at every interval thereafter. Diclofenac required longer time to reach maximum effectiveness. Piroxicam's superiority was greater at the first and second days after the initial dose of medication was taken. With respect to side effects, piroxicam was better tolerated by the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nurses were perceived as educated, autonomous and compassionate individuals whose role is vital in health care. These findings might be explained by the high degree of personal contact that the sample had with nurses. It is possible that personal contact with nurses may mediate against the negative media image of nursing. As one respondent wrote, \"Nursing care after recent surgery certainly erased all stereotyped notions....\" The implications are tremendous for the role of the nurse in every encounter with the public. Nursing's energies might be best directed toward promoting nursing, not as it is portrayed in the media world of make-believe, but as it is lived by real nurses and their clients. Nurses must convey an image of caring, competent professionals who are capable of addressing society's health care needs. In the words of another respondent, \"Unfortunately, the American public does not know the reality of professional nursing and the nurses have been treated unfairly, far from what they deserve.... I hope the American public will look on nursing as one of the most respectable professions and give the nurses credit for their efforts, devotion, and knowledge....\"\r"

Work status and infant difficultness were related to perceived stress. Neither had direct effects on maternal identity, but were related to it through the mediating effects of perceived stress. While health practices did not show buffering effects between stressors and perceived stress, these did contribute additively to the prediction of stress perception. Also, health practices contributed additively to the prediction of identity. Notable among the health practices predicting identity were self-actualizing expression, nutrition, interpersonal support, and stress management. These findings support a stress process model of parenting in which: (a) effects of stressors on maternal identity are mediated by perception of stress, and (b) health practices contribute positively and directly to maternal identity.\r"

Ninety-seven battered women were compared with 96 nonbattered women who were also having serious problems in an intimate relationship with a man. The two groups were similar on the majority of model variables, including self-esteem (TSCS), self-care agency (DSCAI), self-blame, depression (BDI), and control in the relationship. Both groups scored significantly below normative groups in self-esteem. The battered women had more frequent and severe physical symptoms of stress and grief and had thought of or tried more solutions to the relationship problems. Both models had significant explanatory power, especially for battered women, and were equally applicable for formulating theory and nursing care interventions.\r"

Older widows (n = 100) and widowers (n = 59) were identified through church burial records and interviewed using the Ways of Coping Checklist, Sickness Impact Profile, and questionnaires to assess appraisal of bereavement and resources. Path analysis indicated that lower threat appraisal, more problem-focused and less emotion-focused coping, greater resource strength, and younger age had direct effects on reducing psychosocial health dysfunction, explaining 30% of the variance. Higher threat appraisal influenced the use of more problem- and emotion-focused coping strategies. Greater resource strength directly influenced lower threat appraisal. Sex and type of death affected psychosocial health dysfunction through their effect on resource strength.\r"

Both specificity of support and the distinction between perceived and received support were examined. The sample consisted of 529 pregnant women who completed written questionnaires and telephone interviews. Analyses showed that specific perceived and received support were significant and largely independent predictors of all three behaviors. General social support, however, was not a significant predictor of any of the behaviors. Although others have found perceived support rather than received support to be the critical component of social support in its stress-buffering effects on health, this study offers evidence that received support is also important for facilitating positive health behaviors.\r"

One trained observer blind to both automatic and direct measurements obtained all indirect MS measurements. All direct and indirect measurements were made on the same arm. Direct measurements were obtained from 10-second strip chart recordings. In normotensive patients both indirect measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP) underestimated the direct SBP; however, only the SBP value obtained with the automatic device (106 mm Hg) was significantly different, p less than .05, from the direct SBP value (120 mm Hg). No significant difference was noted between methods in measurement of normotensive diastolic blood pressure. In hypertensive patients direct SBP was significantly greater, p less than .05, from both values obtained by indirect measurement. In patients without hypotension the automatic device may be substituted for the MS and direct blood pressure methods. The automatic device may offer the advantage of decreasing observer bias and variability in blood pressure measurement.\r"

Videotaped interactions of 85 physicians and 42 nurse practitioners in either joint or solo practice were analyzed. Tests of a priori hypotheses using hierarchical log-linear modeling yielded the following significant results: Males and physicians in solo practice used more command statements and fewer consequence statements than females and nurse practitioners in solo practice, who used fewer command statements and more consequence statements. All groups used more command/consequence statements than concordance statements.\r"

All introns interrupt protein coding regions of the gene. The 11 exons encoding the alpha subunit of the receptor are dispersed over greater than 90 kbp, whereas the 11 exons encoding the beta subunit are located together in a region of approximately 30 kbp. Three transcriptional initiation sites have been identified and are located 276, 282, and 283 bp upstream of the translation initiation site. In addition, a 247-bp fragment from the promoter region possessing 62.6% of the maximal promoter activity has been identified. This promoter-active fragment lacks a TATA-like sequence but has two possible binding regions for the transcriptional factor Sp1. Comparison of the exon structure of the tyrosine kinase domain of the INSR with the corresponding regions of the human SRC, ROS, and ERBB2 (NGL) protooncogenes indicates that the exon-intron organization of this region has not been well conserved.\r"

Chromosome replication initiates in the daughter stalked cell but is repressed in the daughter swarmer cell until later in the cell cycle. To study cell-type-specific DNA initiation, chromosome replication was directly analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Analysis of Dra I restriction fragments of DNA taken at various times from synchronized cell cultures labeled with 2'-deoxy[3H]guanosine has allowed us to determine the origin of DNA replication, the rate and direction of fork movement, and the order of gene replication. The first labeled Dra I fragment to appear contains the site of replication initiation. Based on the correlation of the physical and genetic maps derived by Ely and Gerardot [Ely, B. & Gerardot, C. J. (1988) Gene 68, 323-333], the origin was localized to a 305-kilobase fragment containing the rrnA gene. Furthermore, the sequential replication through unmapped Dra I fragments has enabled us to localize their positions on the genome. The order of appearance of labeled restriction fragments revealed that the chromosome replicates bidirectionally at a fork movement rate of 21 kilobases per minute.\r"

The 3' end of the attenuated RNA is capable of forming a hairpin structure that is followed by a stretch of uridines. To distinguish whether the attenuated RNA is formed as a result of processing, pausing, or termination and to dissect structural elements, factors, or mechanisms that are involved in its formation, we used in vitro systems: isolated nuclei and cell-free extracts from HeLa cells. The results of the in vitro studies show that the attenuated RNA is a result of pausing or termination and not processing. Additionally, a salt-soluble factor and RNA secondary structure were implicated in the process of termination.\r"

Exposure of platelets to the TxA2 receptor agonists U46619 and SQ 26,655 (1.4 microM) resulted in a 60-90% decrease in subsequent TxA2 receptor-stimulated aggregation, calcium release, and protein kinase C activation. The desensitization was rapid, with a half-time of 2-3 min. The sequence of events involved in TxA2 receptor desensitization involves initial uncoupling of the receptor from a guanine nucleotide binding (G) protein followed by eventual receptor down-regulation. Consistent with this hypothesis were (i) a 60-70% decrease in SQ 26,655-stimulated platelet GTPase activity, (ii) a shift to the right of the dose-response curve for U46619-stimulated release of calcium [EC50, 275 +/- 51 nM (control)] vs. 475 +/- 71 nM (desensitized); P less than 0.01], and (iii) a delayed loss of receptor sites. In summary, exposure of platelets to TxA2 receptor agonists results in rapid desensitization of the biochemical and functional responses to interaction with its receptor in human platelets. The kinetics of these events are consistent with the hypothesis that this icosanoid functions in the regulation as well as amplification of platelet activation in vivo.\r"

The mutant enzyme D52N exhibits approximately 5% of the wild-type lytic activity against Micrococcus luteus cell walls, while there is no measurable activity associated with E35Q (0.1% +/- 0.1%). The measured dissociation constants for the chitotriose-enzyme complexes were 4.1 microM (D52N) and 13.4 microM (E35Q) vs. 8.6 microM for wild type, indicating that the alterations in catalytic properties may be due in part to binding effects as well as to direct catalytic participation of these residues. The mutant lysozymes have been expressed in and secreted from yeast and obtained at a level of approximately 5 mg per liter of culture by high-salt elution from the cell walls.\r"

In early night phase, when bioluminescence is increasing and LBP levels are rising in the cell, pulse labeling experiments show that LBP is being rapidly synthesized in vivo. At other times, the rate of LBP synthesis is at least 50 times lower, while the rate of synthesis of most other proteins remains the same. The LBP mRNA levels, as determined by in vitro translations and by RNA (Northern) hybridizations, do not vary over the daily cycle, indicating that circadian control of bioluminescence in this species is mediated by translation.\r"

We have examined the role of RNA in chromatin organization, using selective detergent extraction of cells, RNA synthesis inhibitors, and enzymatic digestion of nuclear RNA. Comparison of extracted and unextracted cells showed that the important features of chromatin architecture were largely unchanged by the extraction procedure. Normally, chromatin was distributed in small heterochromatic regions and dispersed euchromatic strands. Ribonucleoprotein granules were dispersed throughout the euchromatic regions. Exposure to actinomycin led to the redistribution of chromatin into large clumps, leaving large empty spaces and a dense clustering of the remaining ribonucleoprotein granules. When the nuclei of extracted cells were digested with RNase A, there was a rearrangement of chromatin similar to but more pronounced than that seen in cells exposed to actinomycin. The inhibitor 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidizole also inhibits RNA synthesis but by a different mechanism that leaves no nascent RNA chains. The drug had little effect on chromatin after brief exposure but resembled actinomycin in its effect at longer times. We also examined the structure of the nuclear matrix to which most heteronuclear RNA remains associated. Pretreatment of cells with actinomycin or digestion of the nuclear matrix with RNase A caused the matrix fibers to collapse and aggregate. The experiments show a parallel decay of chromatin and of nuclear matrix organization with the depletion of nuclear RNA and suggest that RNA is a structural component of the nuclear matrix, which in turn may organize the higher order structure of chromatin.\r"

While CpG frequency has fallen to its lowest levels in DNA that is transcriptionally silent, TpA is most stringently excluded in DNA destined to be expressed as mRNA in the cytosol. This observation suggests that the selective pressures leading to the removal of CpG and TpA operate at different levels. With respect to TpA, dinucleotide scarcity may reflect a requirement for mRNA stability and may indicate the action of UpA-selective ribonucleases. We propose that, by reason of its instability, UpA must have been very rare in primordial RNA. Therefore, tRNA with the anticodon for this dinucleotide may have failed to evolve, making UpA the primordial doublet \"stop\" codon. The modern triplet code has faithfully conserved this arrangement in the two universal stop codons, UAA and UAG.\r"

Genomic DNA from 24 normal, unrelated individuals was digested and separated into fragments ranging from 23 kilobases (kb) to 2 megabases (Mb) in length. Digestion with 12 different restriction enzymes with 4- to 8-base-pair recognition sequences and hybridization with alphoid sequences revealed chromosome-specific hybridization patterns. Similarities in the organization of the centromeric regions of the three chromosomes included NotI, SfiI, and SalI fragments of greater than 2 Mb and Sau3A1 and Alu I fragments of less than 150 kb. Each restriction enzyme with a 6-base-pair recognition sequence (Ava II, BamHI, HindIII, Hpa I, Pst I, Sal I, Sst I, and Xba I) detected polymorphic DNA fragments of 50 kb to 2 Mb. Forty percent or more of the individuals screened revealed a unique hybridization pattern with these enzymes and at least one of the three chromosome-specific alphoid probes. Five individuals differed from one another in hybridization pattern for each of the three enzymes HindIII, HpaI, and SstI and for each of the three centromeric probes. All 24 individuals could be distinguished on the basis of unique hybridization patterns with only two enzymes and one chromosome-specific alphoid probe. Family studies showed that these polymorphisms are inherited. The high frequency of these macro restriction fragment length polymorphisms illustrates the high degree of variability of the centromeric region among normal individuals and demonstrates its usefulness for DNA fingerprinting and pericentromeric mapping by linkage analysis.\r"

One of eight transgenic mice was a high producer for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV e antigen (HBeAg) in the serum. The HBV genomes were transmitted to the next generation and these F1 mice also produced HBsAg and HBeAg. mRNAs of 3.5, 2.1, and 0.8 kilobases were detected in the livers and the kidneys of these mice. In addition, a 0.8-kilobase RNA was detected in the testis. Single-stranded and partially double-stranded HBV DNAs were shown to be produced in the cytoplasm of the liver and kidneys. These HBV DNAs were associated with the core particles, indistinguishable from nucleocapsid produced in an infected human liver. Viral genome DNA was detected in the serum. These results demonstrate that the HBV genome integrated into the mouse chromosome acted as a template for viral gene expression, allowing viral replication. Thus, these transgenic mice should be useful for detailed studies of the replication and expression of HBV and for pathological studies of hepatitis, including the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The 3' flanking region of the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene contains a hypervariable region consisting of a variable number of tandemly repeated short A + T-rich DNA sequences (VNTRs). We present a general method that utilizes the polymerase chain reaction to rapidly and accurately type this and other VNTR loci. We use tailored oligonucleotides and thermostable Taq polymerase to amplify the targeted region. The amplification products are directly visualized after agarose gel electrophoresis. Twelve alleles were readily identified in a sample of 125 unrelated individuals. The alleles differ with respect to the length of the amplified gene region. This genetic variability is inherited in an autosomal codominant manner. DNA sequence data indicate that individual alleles differ in the number of repeat units and the sensitivity of the technique is such that alleles differing in length by only 32 base pairs are readily distinguishable. A system of nomenclature based on the number of repeat units is suggested; an allele containing 37 repeat units is designated 3' beta 37, one containing 35 units is 3' beta 35, and so on. The frequency distribution of the 12 apoB VNTR alleles is bimodal with peaks at 37 and 47 repeat units and a nadir near 43 repeat units. We estimate that the 3' apoB VNTR locus has a heterozygosity index of 0.75 and a polymorphic information content of 0.73. It is a highly informative marker for genetic linkage studies on chromosome 2 and clinical and epidemiological studies involving the apoB gene. The high sensitivity and inexpensive nature of this technique make it superior to traditional Southern blot analysis for typing the 3' apoB VNTR. The method described is also directly applicable for rapid typing of other VNTRs in the human genome.\r"

By monitoring the processed product with three site-directed antibodies, it was shown that microsomal extracts from CHO cells that contain other recognized processing activities also remove the carboxyl-terminal signal peptide from the preproenzyme in an apparently selective manner. This peptidase-like cleavage may be brought about by the action of a specific transamidase acting on the nascent protein in the absence of an appropriate phosphatidylinositol glycan cosubstrate.\r"

The induction of lethal point mutations with the potent germ-line mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea has been reported. One lethal mutation of prime interest is an allele at the quaking locus on chromosome 17. To map this mutation, quaking(lethal-1), we have intercrossed hybrid mice that carry distinct alleles at many classical and DNA marker loci on proximal chromosome 17. From this cross we have obtained 337 animals recombinant in the T to H-2 region. This number of crossovers provides a mapping resolution in the size range of single mammalian genes if recombinational hot spots are absent. DNA samples obtained from these recombinant animals can be used retrospectively to map any restriction fragment length polymorphism in the region. This set of DNA samples has been used to map the molecular marker D17RP17 just distal of quaking(lethal-1). With the nested set of crossover DNA samples and appropriate cloning techniques, this tightly linked marker can be used to clone the quaking locus.\r"

  ".W": "Autoantibodies to nucleolar components are a common serological feature of patients suffering from scleroderma, a collagen vascular autoimmune disease. While animal models, which spontaneously develop abundant anti-nucleolar antibodies, have not yet been described, high titers of such antibodies may be induced by treating susceptible strains of mice with mercuric chloride. We have identified the nucleolar autoantigen against which the HgCl2-induced IgG autoantibodies from mice of strain B10.S are directed. It is a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 36 kDa and a pI value of approximately 8.6, which is associated with the nucleolar small nuclear RNA U3, and by these criteria must be identical with a polypeptide called fibrillarin. It is striking that scleroderma patients spontaneously produce autoantibodies against the same U3 ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The HgCl2-induced murine and the scleroderma-specific human anti-U3 RNP autoantibodies were indistinguishable in their reactivities toward fibrillarin. They further resemble each other insofar as both recognize epitopes on the 36-kDa protein, which have been highly conserved throughout evolution. Our results provide a basis to investigate at the molecular level whether similar immunoregulatory dysfunctions may lead to the preferential anti-U3 RNP autoantibody production in the animal model and in scleroderma patients.\r"

We have isolated a cDNA coding for a fourth CD1 molecule from a human thymocyte library and termed this molecule CD1d. Reported here are the complete nucleotide sequence and genomic organization of CD1d. They predict that this molecule is related to the previously identified CD1a, -b, and -c molecules and to MHC class I molecules, with three external domains, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The sequence of CD1d is the most divergent among the CD1 molecules in the membrane-distal alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains and in the 5' untranslated region. In contrast, all four CD1 molecules are highly homologous in the membrane-proximal alpha 3 domain, which is likely involved in beta 2-microglobulin binding. A comparison of CD1 and MHC class I sequences suggests that these molecules each evolved to interact with a distinct set of cell surface proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) is a 749-amino acid type II integral membrane protein expressed by most acute lymphoblastic leukemias, certain other lymphoid malignancies with an immature phenotype, and normal lymphoid progenitors. A computer search against the most recent GenBank release (no. 56) indicates that human CALLA cDNA encodes a protein nearly identical to the rat and rabbit neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (\"enkephalinase;\" EC 3.4.24.11). This zinc metalloendopeptidase, which has been shown to inactivate a variety of peptide hormones including enkephalin, chemotactic peptide, substance P, neurotensin, oxytocin, bradykinin, and angiotensins I and II, had not been identified in lymphoid cells. To determine whether CALLA cDNA derived from human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (Nalm-6 cell line) encodes functional neutral endopeptidase activity, we generated CALLA+ stable transfectants in the CALLA- murine myeloma cell line J558 and analyzed them for enzymatic activity in a fluorometric assay based upon cleavage of the substrate glutaryl-Ala-Ala-Phe 4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide at the Ala-Phe bond. Total lysates as well as whole-cell suspensions of the Nalm-6 line and of the CALLA+ transfectants, but not of the CALLA- J558 cells, possessed neutral endopeptidase activity. This enzymatic activity was associated with the cellular membrane fraction and was abrogated by the specific neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon. The unequivocal identification of CALLA as a functional neutral endopeptidase provides insight into its potential role in both normal and malignant lymphoid function.\r"

As control of the rodent host is impracticable at present, the best immediate prospect is vaccination. We tested as potential vaccines in rhesus monkeys a closely related virus, Mopeia virus (two monkeys), and a recombinant vaccinia virus containing the Lassa virus glycoprotein gene, V-LSGPC (four monkeys). Two monkeys vaccinated with the New York Board of Health strain of vaccinia virus as controls died after challenge with Lassa virus. The two monkeys vaccinated with Mopeia virus developed antibodies measurable by radioimmunoprecipitation prior to challenge, and they survived challenge by Lassa virus with minimal physical or physiologic disturbances. However, both showed a transient, low-titer Lassa viremia. Two of the four animals vaccinated with V-LSGPC had antibodies to both Lassa glycoproteins, as determined by radioimmunoprecipitation. All four animals survived a challenge of Lassa virus but experienced a transient febrile illness and moderate physiologic changes following challenge. Virus was recoverable from each of these animals, but at low titer and only during a brief period, as observed for the Mopeia-protected animals. We conclude that V-LSGPC can protect rhesus monkeys against death from Lassa fever.\r"

This manuscript describes the isolation of the genes that code for the methyltransferase, the two subunits of the corrinoid/Fe-S protein, and the two subunits of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. These five genes were found to be clustered within an approximately 10-kilobase segment on the Clostridium thermoaceticum genome. The proteins were expressed at up to 5-10% of Escherichia coli cell protein, and isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside had no effect on the levels of expression, implying that the C. thermoaceticum inserts contained transcriptional and translational signals that were recognized by E. coli. The methyltransferase is expressed in E. coli in a fully active dimeric form with a specific activity and heat stability similar to the enzyme expressed in C. thermoaceticum. However, both the corrinoid/Fe-S protein and carbon dioxide dehydrogenase, although expressed in high amounts and with identical subunit molecular weights in E. coli, are inactive and less heat stable than are the native enzymes from C. thermoaceticum.\r"

These investigations have further revealed that the antibodies are directed against distinct polypeptide fractions (100 kDa, 76 kDa, 59 kDa, 57 kDa, 54 kDa) that have been covalently modified by the reactive trifluoroacetyl halide metabolite of halothane. In this paper, the trifluoroacetylated (TFA) 59-kDa neoantigen (59-kDa-TFA) recognized by the patients' antibodies was isolated from liver microsomes of halothane-treated rats by chromatography on an immunoaffinity column of anti-TFA IgG. Antibodies were raised against the 59-kDa-TFA protein and were used to purify the native protein from liver microsomes of untreated rats. Based upon its apparent monomeric molecular mass, NH2-terminal amino acid sequence, catalytic activity, and other physical properties, the protein has been identified as a previously characterized microsomal carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1). A similar strategy may be used to purify and characterized neoantigens associated with other drug toxicities that are believed to have an immunopathological basis.\r"

PMEA also inhibits Moloney murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV)-induced transformation of murine C3H embryo fibroblasts. Moreover, PMEA causes a dose-dependent suppression of tumor formation and associated mortality in mice inoculated with Mo-MSV. At a dose of 50 or 20 mg/kg per day PMEA effected a 90-100% protection of the mice against Mo-MSV-induced tumor formation and mortality. Even with a PMEA dose as low as 1 to 5 mg/kg per day, tumor formation was significantly delayed and the survival rate was significantly enhanced. In parallel experiments, azidothymidine exhibited a comparable inhibitory effect on Mo-MSV-induced tumor formation and associated death only at a 25-fold higher dose than PMEA. Because PMEA has stronger in vivo antiretrovirus potency and selectivity than azidothymidine and various other compounds currently being subjected to clinical trials, PMEA studies should be pursued to assess the potential of this compound in the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other retrovirus infections in humans.\r"

The present studies were aimed at establishing genetically engineered cell lines that overexpress amyloid immunoreactivity and that may be relevant to amyloid accumulation in the Alzheimer disease brain. We used cloned amyloid cDNA that contains a region encoding A4 (beta-polypeptide) amino acids along with recently developed tumor virus vectors derived from simian virus 40 to prepare transformed cells. After transient and permanent transfection, a variety of cell types overexpressed A4 immunoreactivity that was detected by highly specific monoclonal antibodies. We observed that the use of an amyloid subdomain containing the A4 region, but lacking the sequence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor found in amyloid precursor protein variants, was sufficient to obtain cells that overproduced an A4 epitope. The transformed cells were readily propagated in culture and may provide an experimental medium to elucidate aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. The cellular models may also serve as tools for deriving potentially useful therapeutic agents.\r"

Neurons that are immunopositive for phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (S-adenosyl-L-methionine:phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.29) are present in the central nucleus of the amygdala as well as in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.

The phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase immunopositivity disappears by day 35, while a small amount of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells still can be found in the adult. In situ hybridization reveals tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA in the above nuclei in both young and adult animals. The number of the positive cells decreases in adulthood. RNA blot-hybridization analysis showed the presence of phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase mRNA in the amygdala and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis in the young and in the adult rat brain.

In stochastic models such as thermodynamic ones, the probabilistic input-output function of a formal neuron is sigmoid, having its maximal slope inversely related to a variable called \"temperature.\" Our results indicate that, for a biological neuron, the probability that given excitatory input signals reach threshold is also sigmoid, allowing definition of a temperature that is proportional to the mean number of quanta comprising noise and can be modified by activity in the presynaptic network, a notion which could be included in neural models. By introducing uncertainty to the input-output relation of central neurons, synaptic noise could be a critical determinant of neuronal computational systems, allowing assemblies of cells to undergo continuous transitions between states.\r"

Retinal ganglion cells in newborn Syrian hamsters were made to project permanently to the main thalamic somatosensory (ventrobasal) nucleus. When the animals were adults, single unit recordings were made in the somatosensory cortices, the principal targets of the ventrobasal nucleus. The somatosensory neurons responded to visual stimulation of distinct receptive fields, and their response properties resembled, in several characteristic features, those of normal visual cortical neurons. In the visual cortex of normal animals and the somatosensory cortex of operated animals, the same functional categories of neurons occurred in similar proportions, and the neurons' selectivity for the orientation or direction of movement of visual stimuli was comparable. These results suggest that thalamic nuclei or cortical areas at corresponding levels in the visual and somatosensory pathways perform similar transformations on their inputs.\r"

To examine the bases for the different degrees of desensitization, cat-Torpedo AcChoR hybrids were formed by injecting oocytes with cat denervated muscle mRNA mixed with a large excess of cloned Torpedo AcChoR subunit mRNAs. Hybrid AcChoRs formed by coinjection of cat muscle mRNA with the Torpedo beta or delta subunit mRNAs desensitized as slowly as cat AcChoR. In contrast, the hybrid AcChoRs expressed by coinjection with the Torpedo gamma subunit mRNA desensitized much more rapidly than cat AcChoR. The AcChoRs expressed in oocytes injected with cat muscle mRNA together with the Torpedo beta, gamma, and delta subunit mRNAs desensitized as rapidly as Torpedo AcChoR, indicating that the cat alpha subunit does not play an important role in determining the slow rate of desensitization. It is concluded that the difference in the rates of desensitization of cat and Torpedo AcChoRs is determined mainly by differences in their respective gamma subunits.\r"

This construct was injected into fertilized mouse eggs, and expression was analyzed in 16-day fetal livers and brains. All 11 fetuses that contained intact copies of the transgene expressed correctly initiated human alpha-globin mRNA in the erythroid fetal liver but not in brain. Levels of expression ranged from 4% to 337% of endogenous mouse beta-globin mRNA. A human alpha-globin construct that did not contain super-hypersensitive sites was not expressed. These results demonstrate that human beta-globin locus activation sequences can stimulate high levels of human alpha-globin gene expression in erythroid tissue of transgenic mice. The results also provide a foundation for experiments designed to coexpress human alpha- and beta-globin genes in transgenic mice and suggest a feasible approach for production of a mouse model for human sickle cell disease.\r"

  ".W": "The action of botulinum neurotoxin on acetylcholine release, and on the structural changes at the presynaptic membrane associated with the transmitter release, was studied by using a subcellular fraction of cholinergic nerve terminals (synaptosomes) isolated from the Torpedo electric organ. Acetylcholine and ATP release were continuously monitored by chemiluminescent methods. To catch the membrane morphological changes, the quick-freezing method was applied. Our results show that botulinum neurotoxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from these isolated nerve terminals in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ATP release is not affected. The maximal inhibition (70%) is achieved at neurotoxin concentrations as low as 125 pM with an incubation time of 6 min. This effect is not linked to an alteration of the integrity of the synaptosomes since, after poisoning by botulinum neurotoxin type A, they show a nonmodified occluded lactate dehydrogenase activity. Moreover, membrane potential is not altered by the toxin with respect to the control, either in resting condition or after potassium depolarization. In addition to acetylcholine release inhibition, botulinum neurotoxin blocks the rearrangement of the presynaptic intramembrane particles induced by potassium stimulation. The action of botulinum neurotoxin suggests that the intramembrane particle rearrangement is related to the acetylcholine secretion induced by potassium stimulation in synaptosomes isolated from the electric organ of Torpedo marmorata.\r"

This study describes the use of a monoclonal antibody we have developed to study mechanisms of sexual differentiation of brain structure and function. Used as a marker in immunocytochemistry, antibody AB-2 revealed subsets of cells, including radial glia, transiently during the perinatal period. Peak reactivity in radial glia was on embryonic day 19 in males and on postnatal day 1 in females. On postnatal day 1, AB-2 immunoreactivity in radial glia was 2-fold greater in females than in males. Greater activity was detected in males on one side of the brain than the other (2- to 4-fold, depending on the region). To test the hormone dependence of this sex difference, pregnant rats were injected with testosterone propionate to expose fetal females to androgen on embryonic day 18. This resulted in lower levels of AB-2 immunoreactivity in radial glia of the treated female offspring on postnatal day 1 relative to control females, and the pattern was bilaterally asymmetric, approaching that of males. Thus the difference between sexes in immunoreactivity with AB-2 as a marker was hormone dependent in a predictable manner. Whether this marker is revealing a sex difference in accessibility of antigen by immunocytochemistry or a sex difference in intrinsic antigen levels is not yet resolved. In either case these results support the hypothesis that certain hormone-dependent molecular events occur transiently during development.\r"

Aldosterone stimulated electrogenic Na absorption, as measured by amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current (Isc), and reduced net K absorption from +2.5 +/- 0.2 microEq/cm2 per hr to +0.8 +/- 0.3 microEq/cm2 per hr (mean +/- SEM). Amiloride addition to the mucosal solution did not enhance net K absorption, as expected if inhibiting active Na absorption would reduce active K secretion as in the distal nephron. The amiloride-insensitive Isc was -1.0 +/- 0.2 microEq/cm2 per hr (mean +/- SEM) and was inhibited by mucosal addition of Ba, a K channel blocker. Addition of bumetanide to the serosal solution also inhibited this negative Isc, and K transport returned to the control level of net absorption. Thus, the amiloride-insensitive, negative Isc is consistent with active K secretion stimulated by aldosterone. This stimulation of an active K secretory pathway by aldosterone occurred without altering the active K absorption pathway that also is present. These results indicate that the aldosterone-stimulated K secretory pathway operates independently of the amiloride-sensitive Na absorption pathway, which also is stimulated by aldosterone.\r"

To define the recognition sequence of the dioxin receptor and its relationship with that of the glucocorticoid receptor, oligonucleotides derived from dioxin-responsive elements of the rat cytochrome P-450c gene were tested for their ability to form specific protein-DNA complexes in a gel retardation assay. We found that a previously defined sequence motif that is similar to the glucocorticoid-responsive element and exhibits strong enhancer activity in response to dioxin receptor ligands bound a dioxin-inducible factor with high specificity but was not recognized by the DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor. Binding to this element was only observed in nuclear extracts of wild-type mouse hepatoma cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner and not in nuclear extracts from a nonresponsive mutant cell line deficient in DNA binding of the dioxin receptor. The specific DNA-binding activity in wild-type nuclear extracts comigrated in a Superose size-exclusion column and cosedimented on sucrose gradients with the in vivo labeled dioxin receptor. These experiments strongly suggest that the dioxin receptor is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein and is not only biochemically but also functionally similar to the steroid receptor family.\r"

Results are consistent with the currently accepted mechanism of peptide chloromethyl ketone inhibition of serine proteases, in that MSACK cross-links the catalytic residues His-57 and Ser-195. The structure of the HNE-MSACK complex is compared with that of porcine pancreatic elastase in complex with L-647,957, a beta-lactam inhibitor of both elastases. The distribution of positively charged residues on HNE is highly asymmetric and may play a role in its specific association with the underlying negatively charged proteoglycan matrix of the neutrophil granules in which the enzyme is stored.\r"

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified dA/dT sequence-binding protein in the presence of NaDodSO4 showed a single protein band of 62 kDa. Nitrocellulose filter binding assays using homopolydeoxynucleotides indicated that the purified protein preferentially binds to dA/dT sequences in single-stranded or duplex DNAs. Gel mobility shift assays with a variety of DNAs showed that the purified protein specifically binds to a fragment of simian virus 40 DNA containing the minimal (core) origin for replication. The binding occurred in a protein-dependent manner and in the presence of a vast excess of competing DNAs lacking the simian virus replication origin. The origin binding was reduced, however, when DNA fragments from simian virus 40 deletion mutants containing deletions within the 17-base-pair A + T-rich tract in the core DNA replication origin were used in the assays. These results indicate that the dA/dT sequence-binding protein preferentially binds to the 17-base-pair A + T-rich tract and suggest a possible role for the protein in the initiation of DNA replication.\r"

By mRNA analysis we have shown that the heme oxygenase gene is also induced in cultured human skin fibroblasts by UVA radiation, hydrogen peroxide, cadmium chloride, iodoacetamide, and menadione. The known antioxidant properties of heme catabolites taken together with the observation of a high level of induction of the enzyme in cells from an organ not involved in hemoglobin breakdown strongly supports the proposal that the induction of heme oxygenase may be a general response to oxidant stress and constitutes an important cellular defense mechanism against oxidative damage.\r"

The saline-extractable soluble immunoreactivity shares at least three epitopes in common with the native pancreatic form of the protein; the Mr varies from approximately 17,000 to 20,000. Quantitative measurements of PTP immunoreactivity in various regions of several AD brains revealed levels varying from 12 to 295 ng/g of tissue (mean, 116 ng/g) compared with 1-11 ng/g of tissue (mean, 5 ng/g) found in comparable areas of control brains. Immunocytochemistry performed with the anti-PTP monoclonal antibodies demonstrate PTP immunoreactivity within large pyramidal neurons--many of which contain neurofibrillary tangles in both AD and Down syndrome. Less accumulation was observed in astrocytes, and some PTP immunoreactivity was found extracellularly. The highest number of labeled cells in AD and Down syndrome was seen in the hippocampal formation. Fewer positive-staining cells were noted in normal and disease control brains. We conclude, therefore, that an exocrine pancreatic protein is present in the central nervous system of normal individuals at low levels; in AD brain concentrations of this protein are much higher.\r"

Purified released peptides and the residual disulfide-linked core were monitored at each step by use of amino acid analysis, gas-phase sequencing, and mass spectrometry. The approach included application of gas-phase sequencing to assign disulfide pairs in peptides containing multiple disulfides. The results demonstrate that neurophysin disulfides are paired in two distinct domains--an NH2 domain (residues 10-54) containing four disulfides and a COOH domain (residues 61-85) containing three disulfides. The specific disulfide bridges are Cys-10 to Cys-54, Cys-13 to Cys-27, Cys-21 to Cys-44, Cys-28 to Cys-34, Cys-61 to Cys-73, Cys-74 to Cys-79, and Cys-67 to Cys-85. The results place the internally duplicated segments of neurophysin (residues 12-31 and 60-77) in separate domains. Disulfide-pairing patterns within each domain are homologous with the exception of the Cys-10 to Cys-54 bond, which is unique to the NH2 domain and which links the two ends of this domain together. The potential role of the Cys-10 to Cys-54 bond in organizing the hormone-binding site is discussed.\r"

The worldwide ethnic and geographic distribution of certain albumin genetic variants appears to be nonrandom. Moreover, we have found that structurally identical variants may occur at different frequencies in ethnically distinct populations, presumably owing to independent mutations. In this study, albumin B and two types of proalbumins, which as a group are the most common European albumin variants, have also been found in Asians. We have identified the amino acid substitution characteristic of albumin B (glutamic acid----lysine at position 570) in alloalbumins from six unrelated individuals of five different European descents and also in two Japanese and one Cambodian. The two types of proalbumins most common in Europe (Lille type, arginine----histidine at position -2; Christchurch type, arginine----glutamic acid at position -1) also occur in Japan. These results provide evidence for independent mutations at single sites in the albumin genome. The clustering of these and of several other amino acid exchanges in certain regions of the albumin molecule suggests two possibilities: that certain sites are hypermutable or that mutants involving certain sites are more subject to selection than mutants involving others.\r"

The sequence-specific interactions between Cro repressor and the operator DNA occur at the symmetrically disposed outer 7-base-pair positions of each half operator and at the central base-pair position. The binding of Cro is almost symmetrical with respect to the pseudo-twofold symmetry of the binding site. The binding free energy changes calculated from the affinity changes are mostly additive for specific Cro binding. Also the binding affinities of Cro to the operators or any other DNA sequences can be predicted by simple addition of free energy changes of single base substitutions. We isolated cro mutants by site-directed mutagenesis and studied their DNA binding to the wild-type and base-substituted mutant operators. The sequence-specific contacts derived from such studies are significantly different from the models proposed by Ohlendorf et al. [Ohlendorf, D. H., Anderson, W. F., Takeda, Y. & Matthews, B. W.

This was associated with an increase in intranuclear free Ca2+ concentration as measured with the fluorescent dye 1-[2-(5-carboxyoxazol-2-yl)-6-aminobenzofuran-5-oxy]-2-(2'-a mino-5'- methylphenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (fura-2). Inhibitors of microsomal and mitochondrial Ca2+ translocases had no effect on nuclear Ca2+ sequestration, indicating that it was distinct from previously known intracellular Ca2+-transporting systems. Ca2+ uptake and the associated increase in intranuclear free Ca2+ concentration were prevented by calmidazolium, a potent calmodulin antagonist. Partial characterization of the ATP-stimulated nuclear Ca2+ uptake showed that maximal rates of Ca2+ uptake and increase in intranuclear free Ca2+ level occurred at concentrations of Ca2+ normally present in the cytosol of mammalian cells. Together, these results show that a distinct, ATP- and calmodulin-dependent Ca2+ uptake system exists in liver nuclei. This system may play an important role in the regulation of intranuclear Ca2+-dependent processes.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously shown that nuclear transcripts of the multifunctional enzyme, carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamylase, dihydroorotase RNA can be released from nuclei of Syrian hamster cells as compact ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles that sediment at the 200S region in a sucrose gradient. The 200S nuclear RNP particles contain U1, U2, and U6 small nuclear RNPs, which are known to be required for splicing of pre-mRNA, as integral components of the particles. In this study we demonstrate that nuclear transcripts of dihydrofolate reductase in Syrian hamster cells and of beta-actin in both Syrian hamster and human cells are also released from the respective nuclei as 200S particles--despite the difference in length of these RNAs. Electron microscopy of the 200S particles revealed discrete compact composite structures with a cross section of approximately 50 nm. Finding that two more nuclear RNAs from two different cell types and two different species are released as 200S RNP particles suggests a general mode for packaging of heterogeneous nuclear RNA in large compact RNP particles the size of which is independent of the RNA length.\r"

  ".W": "Skeletal muscle degeneration associated with mitochondrial damage was found after marked depletion of glutathione produced by administration to mice of buthionine sulfoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase. No mitochondrial damage was found in heart. These studies show that in the absence of applied stress (such as ischemia, drug toxicity), very marked depletion (to approximately 3% of the controls) of glutathione must occur before skeletal muscle mitochondria are affected and thus suggest that muscle has a large excess of glutathione. Depletion of glutathione followed a biphasic pattern in skeletal muscle and heart, probably reflecting, in the slow phase, loss of glutathione from mitochondria. Skeletal muscle degeneration did not occur when glutathione monoisopropyl ester was given together with buthionine sulfoximine; it did occur, however, when glutathione was given together with buthionine sulfoximine. Administration of the glutathione monoester (but not of glutathione) prevented the marked decline of mitochondrial glutathione produced by buthionine sulfoximine in skeletal muscle and increased the level of glutathione in heart mitochondria to values higher than the controls. The findings suggest that glutathione monoesters may be useful agents for protection of heart and skeletal muscle against toxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Two B apolipoproteins (apo) are present in human plasma, designated apoB-100 and apoB-48, and represent translational products from mature apoB mRNAs that differ by a single base. Either the glutamine codon encoded by the single-copy apoB gene at nucleotide 6666 is transcribed and translated to produce apoB-100 or an RNA-editing mechanism substitutes a uracil for cytosine, altering this glutamine codon (CAA) to a stop codon (UAA), prematurely terminating translation to produce apoB-48. In the present report, editing of rat apoB transcripts was evaluated by amplification of RNA with the polymerase chain reaction by use of primers based on the apoB cDNA cloned from a rat liver cDNA library. The combined results of this study show that (i) a single copy of the apoB gene exists in the rat; (ii) the rat apoB gene encodes only the glutamine codon for the synthesis of apoB of higher molecular weight (apoBH); (iii) rat apoB transcripts undergo RNA editing; (iv) apoBH and apoB of lower molecular weight (apoBL) in the rat represent structural equivalents of apoB-100 and apoB-48 in humans, respectively; (v) RNA editing occurs in both the liver and intestine of the rat; (vi) rat hepatic apoB RNA is more extensively edited than is human hepatic apoB RNA, which is consistent with the marked increase in apoBL secretion by the rat liver when compared with human; and (vii) the definitive identification of apoBH mRNA as well as apoBL mRNA in the rat intestine provides a mechanism for the biosynthesis of both apoBH and apoBL by the rat intestine.\r"

  ".U": "89098964\r", 
  ".W": "Recently, a number of aspartic acid mutants of bacteriorhodopsin have been shown to be defective in steady-state proton transport. Here we report time-resolved measurements of light-induced proton release and uptake for these mutants. Proton transfers between the protein and the aqueous phase were directly monitored by measuring changes in the bulk conductivity of a micellar solution of bacteriorhodopsin. For the Asp-96----Asn mutant, proton uptake was slowed by greater than 1 order of magnitude with no observable effect on the release step. For Asp-85----Asn, H+ uptake occurred with normal kinetics, but the yield was significantly lower compared with either the Asp-96----Asn mutant or wild type, especially at pH 6. Substitution of glutamate for Asp-85 or Asp-96 had smaller but detectable effects on the kinetics and quantum yield of proton movements. Both asparagine and glutamate substitutions of aspartates at positions 115 and 212 lowered the proton quantum yields. Of these, only the Asp-115----Asn mutant showed an effect on the proton release step, and only the Asp-212----Glu mutation decreased the proton uptake rate. These experiments imply an obligatory role for Asp-96 in H+ uptake in the normal operation of the bacteriorhodopsin proton pump. The results also indicate that the amino acid substitutions affect the kinetics of either H+ release or H+ uptake, but not both. This implies that the two steps occur independently of each other after initiation of the photocycle.\r"

A 32P-labeled protein with an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with antiserum to ADP-ribosylated elongation factor 2 (EF-2). The 32P labeling of the protein was enhanced by culturing cells in medium containing 2% serum instead of 10% serum. The 32P label was completely removed from the protein by treatment with snake venom phosphodiesterase and the digestion product was identified as [32P]AMP, indicating the protein was mono-ADP-ribosylated. HPLC analysis of tryptic peptides of the 32P-labeled 97-kDa protein and purified EF-2, which was ADP-ribosylated in vitro with diphtheria toxin fragment A and [32P]NAD, demonstrated an identical labeled peptide in the two proteins. The data strongly suggest that EF-2 was endogenously ADP-ribosylated in pyBHK cells. Maximum incorporation of radioactivity in EF-2 occurred by 12 hr and remained constant over the subsequent 12 hr. It was estimated that 30-35% of the EF-2 was ADP-ribosylated in cells cultured in medium containing 2% serum. When 32P-labeled cultures were incubated in medium containing unlabeled phosphate, the 32P label was lost from the EF-2 within 30 min.\r"

The purified proteins exhibit antiviral activity on bovine and human cells similar to that of the unmodified IFN-alpha A. The IFN-alpha A-P proteins can be phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase with [gamma-32P]ATP to high specific activity (2000-5000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq) with retention of biological activity. The 32P-labeled IFN-alpha A-P proteins bind to cells and can be covalently bound to the IFN-alpha/beta receptor with a bifunctional reagent as can human IFN-alpha A. The introduction of phosphorylation sites into proteins provides a procedure to prepare a large variety of radioactive proteins for research and clinical use.\r"

Our analysis yields two noteworthy results. First, biocultural games show a greater diversity of dynamical behaviors than their purely biological counterparts, including multiple fully polymorphic equilibria. Second, biocultural games on average exhibit greater equilibrium strategy diversity because of the countervailing influences of cultural transmission and natural selection. Therefore, knowledge of a strategy's influence on Darwinian fitness is not sufficient to infer the evolutionary consequences of biocultural games. Further, our results suggest that cultural transmission in the presence of natural selection may be an important mechanism maintaining behavioral diversity in natural populations.\r"

The disorder appears to result from a mutation in the gene for apoB-100. Extensive sequence analysis of the two alleles of one subject heterozygous for the disorder has revealed a previously unreported mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 that results in the substitution of glutamine for arginine. This same mutant allele occurs in six other, unrelated subjects and in eight affected relatives in two of these families. A partial haplotype of this mutant apoB-100 allele was constructed by sequence analysis and restriction enzyme digestion at positions where variations in the apoB-100 are known to occur. This haplotype is the same in three probands and four affected members of one family and lacks a polymorphic Xba I site whose presence has been correlated with high cholesterol levels. Thus, it appears that the mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 (CGG----CAG), a CG mutational \"hot spot,\" defines a minor apoB-100 allele associated with defective low density lipoproteins and hypercholesterolemia.\r"

The VL region is very similar to that of CRIA-positive anti-p-azobenzenearsonate antibodies as is VH, except for its third complementarity-determining region, which is three amino acids longer; it makes a loop, unique to R19.9, that protrudes into the solvent.

The injection of a synthetic analog of [Met]enkephalin [( D-Ala2,Met5]enkephalinamide, DAMA; 10(-6) M) had a stimulatory, naloxone-reversible effect on the directed migration of immunocompetent hemocytes. Incubation of hemolymph in the presence of exogenous or endogenous opioid material significantly enhanced the adherence of hemocytes on albumin-coated slides as demonstrated by use of indirect Zeiss-Zonax reflectance computer analysis. Conversely, hemocyte adherence was markedly reduced by the addition of naloxone (10(-8) M) to the incubation medium, either alone or in combination with DAMA. The antagonistic effects of naloxone on the stimulatory activities of opioids indicate that, like those previously reported in mammals, they are receptor-mediated. The presence of an endogenous [Met]enkephalin-like material was demonstrated in cell-free hemolymph as well as sequestered hemocytes by use of high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay. These results demonstrate that the capacity of immunocytes to release and respond to opioid neuropeptide messengers is not restricted to mammalian organisms but was developed early in the course of evolution.\r"

  ".W": "An inherited deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase [porphobilinogen ammonia-lyase (polymerizing), EC 4.3.1.8] in humans is responsible for the autosomal dominant disease acute intermittent porphyria. Different classes of mutations have been described at the protein level suggesting that this is a heterogeneous disease. It was previously demonstrated that porphobilinogen deaminase is encoded by two distinct mRNA species expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Analysis of the genomic sequences indicated that these two mRNAs are transcribed from two promoters and only differ in their first exon. The first mutation identified in the human porphobilinogen deaminase gene is a single-base substitution (G----A) in the canonical 5' splice donor site of intron 1. This mutation leads to a particular subtype of acute intermittent porphyria characterized by the restriction of the enzymatic defect to nonerythropoietic tissues. Hybridization analysis using oligonucleotide probes after in vitro amplification of genomic DNA offers another possibility of detecting asymptomatic carriers of the mutation in affected families.\r"

We have studied the effect of apoE on the metabolism of plasma cholesterol by injecting apoE intravenously into rabbits deficient in low density lipoprotein receptors [Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits]. Approximately 30 mg of apoE was injected per rabbit; a total of five WHHL rabbits were used. One hour later, plasma cholesterol levels fell 8.3% (from 488 +/- 192 to 446 +/- 174 mg/dl). After 3 hr, cholesterol levels had fallen by 19% (to 392 +/- 152 mg/dl). The reduced levels were maintained for at least 8 hr after injection of apoE. Cholesterol in very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and intermediate density lipoproteins fell rapidly during the first 2 hr after injection, followed by a reduction in the low density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Changes in apolipoprotein B levels in each lipoprotein fraction were very similar to those of cholesterol. Plasma apoE levels 3 min after injection were elevated 3-fold to 22.8 +/- 6.3 mg/dl and returned to initial levels 8 hr after injection. The rate of removal of intravenously injected 125I-labeled VLDL that had been incubated with apoE was 3-fold higher than that of unmodified VLDL. From these results, we conclude that the injected apoE is incorporated into VLDLs and that VLDL particles carrying more apoE are removed from the blood more rapidly, resulting in reduced formation of low density lipoprotein and lowered cholesterol levels.\r"

This assay measures the frequency in persons of blood type MN of variant erythrocytes that lack the expression of one allelic form of glycophorin A, presumably due to mutational or recombinational events in erythroid precursor cells. Samples of blood from persons with BS showed dramatic 50- to 100-fold increases in the frequency of variants of three types, those with a hemizygous phenotype, those with a homozygous phenotype, and those with what appears to be partial loss of the expression of one locus. The high frequency of homozygous variants, genetic evidence for altered allelic segregation of a specific biochemical locus, provides evidence for increased somatic crossing-over in vivo in BS. An increased generation of functional hemizygosity and homozygosity in their somatic cells may play an important role in the extreme cancer risk of persons with BS.\r"

This is in agreement with the \"onion skin\" model, based on amplification of genes in cultured cells and primary tumors. The amplification was absent in the grandparents but present at the same extent in one of their sons and in a grandson, with similar DNA blot hybridization patterns. In situ hybridization experiments localized the amplified sequences to the long arm of chromosome 3, close to the site where we previously mapped the CHE gene. Altogether, these observations suggest that the initial amplification event occurred early in embryogenesis, spermatogenesis, or oogenesis, where the CHE gene is intensely active and where cholinergic functioning was indicated to be physiologically necessary. Our findings demonstrate a de novo amplification in apparently healthy individuals within an autosomal gene producing a target protein to an inhibitor. Its occurrence in two generations from a family under prolonged exposure to parathion indicates that organophosphorous poisons may be implicated in previously unforeseen long-term ecological effects.\r"

This pattern of endothelial cell expression may indicate a physiological role for P-glycoprotein in regulating the entry of certain molecules into the central nervous system and other anatomic compartments, such as the testes. These tissues, which limit the access of systemic drugs, are known pharmacologic sanctuaries for metastatic cancer. P-glycoprotein expression in capillary endothelium of brain and testes and not other tissues (i.e., kidney and placenta) may in part explain this phenomenon and could have important implications in cancer chemotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of cells of Staphylococcus aureus to fibronectin, which may represent a mechanism of host tissue adherence, involves a fibronectin-receptor protein present on the bacterial surface. Cloning of a gene coding for a staphylococcal fibronectin-binding protein and construction of a fusion protein with fibronectin-binding properties was previously reported from our laboratory. We have now sequenced the gene and deduced a primary sequence of the fibronectin-binding protein. The protein resembles other cell-wall-associated proteins on Gram-positive bacteria in that it (i) appears to be anchored in the cell membrane via its C-terminal end, (ii) contains a proline-rich repeating unit outside the membrane anchor, and (iii) contains a long (36-amino acid) signal sequence at the N terminus. The fibronectin-binding activity has been localized to a domain composed of a 38-amino acid unit repeated completely three times and partially a fourth time; the identity between the three 38-amino acid sequences varies from 42 to 87%. Three synthetic peptides mimicking the structure of each 38-amino acid unit were constructed. All three peptides interacted with fibronectin, as indicated by their ability to inhibit binding of fibronectin to staphylococcal cells, whereas an unrelated 37-amino acid peptide showed no inhibitory activity.\r"

The reduction in retinal dopamine is evident only during light adaptation and is accompanied by a decreased rate of dopamine biosynthesis. To test whether the alteration in dopamine metabolism is related to eye growth, agents known to interact with dopamine receptors were administered locally to deprived eyes. Remarkably, the expected growth in the axial dimension was reduced, while that in the equatorial dimension was not. Therefore retinal dopamine may participate in the pathway linking visual experience and the postnatal regulation of the eye's growth in the axial dimension. The mechanism for control of chick eye growth in the equatorial dimension remains unknown.\r"

We have found that this peptide induces a voltage- and time-dependent conductance in bilayers formed by a mixture of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. This conductance is activated when the cis side is made positive, with an apparent gating charge of 3. The results are consistent with the idea that this segment plays a role in determining the voltage sensitivity of the Na channel.\r"

To our knowledge, the presence of thebaine in mammalian tissue has not been demonstrated previously. Codeine and morphine were also found to exist in ovine brain. The presence of thebaine in ovine brain provides strong evidence that morphine and codeine, in various mammalian tissues, are of endogenous origin and actually biosynthesized from a precursor.\r"

  ".W": "Angiotensin II has been implicated in the regulation of adrenocorticotropin and vasopressin secretion. Angiotensin II may influence the secretion of these hormones either directly at the pituitary gland or by increasing corticotropin-releasing hormone or vasopressin release from cells that are located in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus. Pituitary hormone release may also be influenced by circulating angiotensin II through receptors outside the blood-brain barrier in the subfornical organ. We have used alterations in angiotensin II receptors in hypophysectomized, adrenalectomized, and vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats as indicators of the activity of angiotensin II in the regulation of adrenocorticotropin and vasopressin secretion. Angiotensin receptor number in the paraventricular nucleus and the subfornical organ, but not in the anterior pituitary gland, was significantly decreased by adrenalectomy, and this effect was reversed by corticoids. Vasopressin deficiency decreased angiotensin receptors in the subfornical organ and increased them in the anterior pituitary gland but did not affect angiotensin II binding in either magnocellular or parvocellular subnucleus of the paraventricular nucleus. Our results suggest that angiotensin II may have a corticoid-dependent role in the regulation of corticotropin-releasing hormone secretion, which could be important in the adaptation to elevated corticosterone secretion in stress.\r"

  ".W": "The neural pathways that relay information from cutaneous receptors to the cortex provide the somatic sensory information needed for cortical function. The last sensory relay neurons in this pathway have cell bodies in the thalamus and axons that synapse on neurons in the somatosensory cortex. After cortical lesions that damage mature thalamocortical fibers in the somatosensory cortex, we have attempted to reestablish somatosensory cortical function by grafting embryonic neocortical cells into the lesioned area. Such grafts survive in adult host animals but are not innervated by thalamic neurons, and consequently the grafted neurons show little if any spontaneous activity and no responses to cutaneous stimuli. We have reported that transection of peripheral sensory nerves prior to grafting \"conditions\" or \"primes\" the thalamic neurons in the ventrobasal complex so that they extend axons into grafts subsequently placed in the cortical domain of the cut nerve. In this report we present evidence that the ingrowth of ventrobasal fibers leads to graft neurons that become functionally integrated into the sensory circuitry of the host brain. Specifically, the conditioning lesions made prior to grafting produce graft neurons that are spontaneously active and can be driven by natural activation of cutaneous receptors or electrical stimulation of the transected nerve after it regenerates. Furthermore, oxidative metabolism in these grafts reaches levels that are comparable to normal cortex, whereas without prior nerve cut, oxidative metabolism is abnormally low in neocortical grafts. We conclude that damage to the sensory periphery transsynaptically stimulates reorganization of sensory pathways through mechanisms that include axonal elongation and functional synaptogenesis.\r"

We have isolated and sequenced cDNAs representing the two major classes of PAM mRNA in the adult rat heart atrium. The two types of cDNA, rPAM-1 and rPAM-2, are identical except for the deletion of a 315-base-pair segment within the protein coding region in rPAM-2, suggesting that rPAM-1 and rPAM-2 arise by alternative splicing. Northern analysis using a cDNA probe derived from within the 315-base-pair region deleted in rPAM-2 visualized the larger of the PAM mRNAs in adult rat atrium and not the smaller, indicating that the presence or absence of this 315-nucleotide segment is a major feature distinguishing the two size forms of PAM mRNA. The 105 amino acid segment that distinguishes the two forms of atrial PAM contains a consensus N-glycosylation site and a paired basic amino acid site of potential importance in endoproteolytic processing. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of rat, frog, and bovine PAM cDNAs reveals an extremely well conserved segment in the 3' untranslated region. The high degree of conservation in amino acid sequence throughout the catalytic, intragranular, and cytoplasmic domains of rat atrium, bovine pituitary, and frog skin PAM suggests that both the catalytic and noncatalytic domains of the protein subserve important functions.\r"

In rats, these neurones responded to oxytocin at 50-1000 nM by a reversible increase in firing rate. The oxytocin-induced excitation was suppressed by a synthetic structural analogue that acts as a potent, selective antioxytocic on peripheral receptors. Nonpyramidal neurones were also excited by carbachol at 0.5-10 microM. The effect of this compound was postsynaptic and was blocked by the muscarinic antagonist atropine. In guinea pigs, by contrast, nonpyramidal neurones were unaffected by oxytocin, although they were excited by carbachol. Light microscopic autoradiography, carried out using a radioiodinated selective antioxytocic as a ligand, revealed labeling in the subiculum and in the CA1 area of the hippocampus of rats, whereas no oxytocin-binding sites were detected in the hippocampus of guinea pigs. Our results indicate (i) that a hippocampal action of oxytocin is species-dependent and (ii) that a positive correlation exists between neuronal responsiveness to oxytocin and the presence in the hippocampus of high-affinity binding sites for this peptide.\r"

Stepwise regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between each torque-dependent variable and the following potential predictor variables: age, sex, side of lower extremity dominance, height, weight, percentage of body fat, and thigh girth. The investigators generated two sets of models designed to predict preinjury knee strength. Clinicians can use one set of models by assessing predictor variables before or immediately following injury. The second set of models involves the assessment of predictor variables postinjury, excluding an assessment of percentage of body fat and thigh girth. The results indicated that peak knee torque production can be predicted with statistically significant accuracy (multiple R = .78-.87). The predictive models generated in this study can be used to establish muscle strength goals for patient rehabilitative programs.\r"

Thirty-six healthy adult subjects were videotaped during 10 trials of rolling from a supine to a prone position. Written descriptions of each subject's movements were reduced to general categorical descriptions of movement patterns for three body regions (upper extremities, lower extremities, and head and trunk). Stage theory criteria were used in an attempt to order the movement patterns into developmental sequences. The most common combination of movement patterns was used to describe adults' rolling action. Although stage theory criteria were not met, developmental sequences of movement patterns were proposed for the three body regions. Subjects were quite variable in their rolling movements. The most common form of rolling occurred in less than 12% of the subjects' trials. The descriptions of adults' rolling action gathered in this study provide physical therapists with a variety of movement patterns for teaching patients to roll.\r"

An understanding of this anatomy allows one to develop safely a variety of penile skin flaps for difficult reconstructive problems.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1981, we have been able to modify the mathematical patterns of projection geometry to reshape the skull in craniofacial surgery. Unlike burring, morcellization, rotation, and plate switching, this technique actually changes the shape of individual sections of the skull by changing their radius of curvature. The technique is an adaptation of the principles used by engineers to build complex structures such as ships' hulls, airfoils, and domes. The result is a rigid form of the desired shape that becomes permanent with healing. This has several advantages: 1. An increase in the level of safety of craniofacial procedures for remodeling the skull. This is so because there is no need to dissect normal areas as in the standard plate-switching techniques. 2. Decreased operating room time. 3. An increased range of surgical manipulations. No longer is the surgeon limited to the shape of the material present. 4. Relief of edge pressure on the frontal lobes during scalp closure. 5. Creation of a solid bony form over which the pericranial scalp flap can be draped to form new layers of bone.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine if implantation of Elvax pellets containing exogenous laminin distal to site of lesion could promote regenerative responses in vivo in the adult rat peripheral (sciatic) and central (optic) nerve. In peripheral nerve preparations, Elvax pellets containing laminin or collagen were assessed for their ability to \"lure\" transected axons into 5-mm-long silicone tubes. In optic nerve studies, laminin pellets were inserted distal to site of nerve crush, and the extent of axonal elongation 2.5 mm to the injury site was assessed. Laminin-containing pellets appeared to support appreciable axonal elongation in both systems. This effect was dose-dependent and not exerted by collagen pellets, substrate-free pellets, or pellets containing irradiated laminin. Collagen IV had some beneficial effect in peripheral, but not central, nerve preparations.\r"

It is a trigeminal-vagal-mediated reflex arc. The oculocardiac reflex was noted to occur in 25 of 100 patients (25 percent) undergoing blepharoplasty. A data sheet designed and distributed for use in the operating room identified a reflex-prone patient (RPP) as a young, anxious female, with a cardiac history, operated on under light anesthesia with aggressive fat pad resection. The oculocardiac reflex was more likely to occur in a reflex-prone patient during traction on the medial fat pads and in the left eye. Despite anticipating the fatigue phenomenon in those patients who exhibited a profound bradycardia (35 to 40 beats per minute), it was necessary to release traction in order to permit the heart rate to return to normal. Awareness and treatment of this potentially life-threatening oculocardiac reflex are necessary. Careful patient surveillance and monitoring are mandatory.\r"

The deep temporal fascia and superficial temporal fat pad are anatomically important structures which adjoin the periosteum of the zygomatic arch and lie deep to the frontal nerve.

We describe our approach, which utilizes formal planimetry, cephalometric tracings, and Panorex mandibular radiographs. We utilize the intraoral approach and use an oscillating saw to resect the predetermined segment of bone. In 18 of the 42 patients, we resected muscle as well. We also describe using the preauricular incision in a patient undergoing a concomitant rhytidectomy. Our cosmetic results have been generally satisfactory, with only one inaccurate osteotomy.

Our results demonstrate that a 1-tesla static magnetic field has no statistically significant effect on nerve regeneration as determined by myelinated axon counts and electrophysiologic studies. Also, the specific orientation of the sciatic nerve with respect to the magnetic field has no influence on axonal growth or nerve conduction. Periods of restraint of 12 hours per day for 4 weeks significantly inhibit weight gain but have no effect on peripheral nerve regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that altered collagen metabolism is a contributing factor in the apparent delayed wound healing in denervated regions of spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, a tissue implant (PVA) was used to directly measure collagen deposition. Sterile PVA implants were placed subcutaneously in the inner aspect of the upper arm above the cord injury (innervated) and in the inner aspect of the upper leg below the cord injury (denervated) of 20 spinal cord injury patients and compared to eight healthy volunteers. On day 14, the implants were removed and analyzed histologically by trichrome stain and biochemically for hydroxyproline as a measure of collagen deposition. No remarkable histologic differences were observed in the sponge material removed from the upper regions compared to the lower denervated regions of the spinal cord injury patients. Sponges from both areas were infiltrated with fibroblasts containing well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum and large quantities of trichrome-positive collagen. Likewise, upper and lower histology of controls was identical and nondistinguishable from the corresponding sections obtained from the spinal cord injury patients. Quantitation of the hydroxyproline in the arms of the spinal cord injury patients (n = 20) showed 4.3 +/- 0.7 nmol hydroxyproline per milligram of sponge compared to 4.1 +/- 0.4 nmol/mg in the denervated regions of the lower limb. The hydroxyproline content in the arms of control volunteers was 5.2 +/- 0.7 nmol/mg compared to 3.9 +/- 0.8 nmol/mg in the leg (n = 8). These observations suggest that fibrogenic processes in denervated regions are not reduced significantly compared to innervated regions.\r"

Subdivided Z-plasties proved to be the most effective for lengthening. The finite-element method provided a good simulation of Z-plasties on a skin with complex properties. The lengthening and shortening effects on anisotropic skin were influenced not by the degree but by the direction of the anisotropy, whereas the total force required for transposing the two flaps was vice versa. The finite-element method was found to be useful for finding analytical solutions for biomechanical skin problems.\r"
