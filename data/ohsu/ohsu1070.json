  ".W": "PURPOSE: To determine the relative potency in healthy individuals of the vagally mediated reflexes used clinically to inhibit sinoatrial and atrioventricular node function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease performed face immersion in cold water and the Valsalva maneuver twice, to maximum endurance and to the subjective point of first discomfort, and face immersion in warm water and the Muller maneuver to maximum endurance only. Right and left carotid massage and left, right, and bilateral eyeball compression were each performed for 15 seconds. Change in heart rate was taken as baseline minus the rate over the slowest three consecutive QRS cycles elicited by each maneuver. Fisher's least-significant-difference multiple comparison procedure was used to analyze heart rate responses. Significance was defined as p less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: Maximum pulse decrements from baseline and 95% confidence intervals in beats/minute were as follows: cold-water face immersion to maximum endurance 15.5 (12.3 to 18.5), cold-water face immersion to first discomfort 10.1 (6.7 to 13.1), Valsalva maneuver to maximum endurance 9.2 (6.3 to 12.4), Valsalva maneuver to first discomfort 8.3 (5.0 to 11.3), right carotid massage 7.3 (4.3 to 10.3), left carotid massage 5.2 (2.3 to 8.4), right eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), left eyeball compression 6.6 (3.6 to 9.5), bilateral eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), warm-water face immersion 7.0 (3.2 to 9.8), and Muller maneuver 1.6 (-1.3 to 4.9). Bradycardia was significantly greater for cold-water immersion of the face performed to maximum endurance than for all other maneuvers. CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, the diving reflex is the most potent of the vagally mediated reflexes utilized in clinical practice. Immersion of the face in cold water may prove effective at the bedside when other maneuvers fail to augment vagal tone adequately.\r"

  ".W": "The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was formally defined in 1988 to describe disabling fatigue of at least 6 months' duration of uncertain etiology. Reports of CFS have emerged from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Spain, and France. The disease primarily affects individuals between 20 and 50 years of age, and there is a preponderance of females. Although a triggering infectious illness is reported by most patients with CFS, there is no convincing evidence causally linking any currently recognized infectious agent to CFS. Multiple minor immunologic aberrations are frequent but inconsistent and of uncertain significance. There is no consistent evidence for myopathy or physical deconditioning. Depression is found in approximately 50% of CFS patients, with depression preceding the physical symptoms in half of the cases. No therapy has been proved effective in controlled clinical trials with prolonged follow-up, although antidepressants have not been formally evaluated. The long-term prognosis of patients with CFS has not been well studied, but CFS appears to be a disease of prolonged duration with considerable morbidity but no mortality. Further research into the pathogenesis and treatment of CFS is necessary.\r"

  ".W": "A 55-year-old woman who had been receiving treatment with amiodarone for recurrent supraventricular tachyarrhythmias became thyrotoxic after 30 months of treatment. The thyroid gland was not enlarged or tender. Amiodarone was discontinued, and thyrotoxicosis gradually abated. A thyroid scan performed at that time revealed a gland of normal size and texture. Six months later, amiodarone treatment was reinstated due to life-threatening tachyarrhythmia; however, the patient remained euthyroid. Three years later, multinodular goiter began to develop, and 5 years after that, the patient became hypothyroid. Tests for thyroid autoantibodies, as well as inhibitory and stimulatory antibodies, were negative, and fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed an adenomatous goiter. Treatment with amiodarone was continued; however, therapy with L-thyroxin was initiated, followed by a complete regression of the goiter. The patient has since required a maintenance dose of L-thyroxin. The possible mechanisms by which iodine-containing drugs induce thyroid disfunction are reviewed, suggesting this case was caused by an alteration in the sensitivity of the intrinsic autoregulation of the thyroid gland to iodine.\r"

The literature on endocarditis caused by S. epidermidis is also reviewed and the clinical features of patients with native valve endocarditis due to this organism are compared with those of patients from a general series of infective endocarditis cases. Compared with infective endocarditis caused by other organisms, S. epidermidis endocarditis tends to occur more frequently in male patients. Patients with S. epidermidis endocarditis exhibit fewer embolic complications and skin manifestations. The frequency of congestive heart failure is lower in this group. The relative indolent course and apparent rarity of native valve S. epidermidis endocarditis necessitate a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis.\r"

One objective of these studies was to determine the extent to which A. melanimon was biologically capable of serving as a horizontal arbovirus vector. Daily survivorship was estimated to be 0.90 and 0.84 in MRR studies conducted in September 1987 and August 1988, 0.89 based on changes in the parity state and abundance of the native population in August 1988 and 0.82 using summer-long parity data in 1988. Gonotrophic cycle length (GCL) was estimated to be five days in three studies. Aedes melanimon densities were estimated to be approximately 1,000,000 and 15,000 females per hectare in September 1987 and August 1988 respectively. Parous A. melanimon females were collected on each sampling occasion from April to November 1988, suggesting that A. melanimon maintained a continuous presence in the study area throughout the summer. The results of these studies suggest that A. melanimon has the potential to be an efficient horizontal vector of western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), based on high adult survivorship, short GCL, high abundance and a continuous presence across the summer. This supports the concept of a WEE transmission cycle in the Sacramento Valley involving Ae. melanimon as an important vector. Aedes melanimon also can be an efficient horizontal vector of California encephalitis virus (CE), though the importance of horizontal transmission to the maintenance of CE virus is unclear.\r"

The morbidity associated with dengue infection on Hainan Island was 1,913 per 100,000 residents, with a case fatality rate of 0.25%. Severe disease was more prevalent in the 10-29-year-old age group. Principal clinical features in laboratory-confirmed cases were fever, osteoarthralgia, hemorrhage and/or shock, and thrombocytopenia. Complications such as acute intravascular hemolysis, diffuse intravascular coagulation, hemoconcentration, pleural effusion, altered mentality, and pneumonia were also observed. One hundred twenty-five isolates of dengue 2 virus were recovered from acute-phase serum samples from 278 patients, and 5 strains of this same virus serotype were isolated from 5 pools of adult Ae. aegypti.\r"

  ".W": "We studied Aotus lemurinus, Panamanian night monkeys, for susceptibility to Toxoplasma infection and for their capacity to develop immunity using either sufadiazine prophylaxis or the non-persistent ts-4 vaccine. The animals were highly susceptible to infection with a mouse pathogenic (T265) and a mouse nonpathogenic (T163) Toxoplasma isolate. A calculated single bradyzoite by mouth gave rise to infection which was fatal in nine to 12 days. Chemoprophylaxis with 60-300 of sulfadiazine mg per day for up to 40 days protected the animals; however this was followed by fatal reactivation of infection between 11 and 70 days after treatment was stopped. Vaccination was carried out in two or three doses subcutaneously. Challenge was performed in 26 animals using both Toxoplasma isolates. Five monkeys (19%) survived for over a year, 10 died after a prolonged illness, and 11 died as rapidly as the seven controls. Safety tests showed the vaccine to be nonpathogenic in 111 adults except for slight fever and local inflammation, although one of four juveniles died from disseminated infection. Vaccination of 25 pregnant monkeys was non-pathogenic; however two of 25 fetuses were aborted, one of which was infected and one newborn had microphthalmia, retinitis and a cataract; four of the offspring were not tested. When six lactating monkeys were vaccinated, Toxoplasma was not transmitted to the infants. The high susceptibility to Toxoplasma and the low immunizability was circumstantially attributed to absence of exposure and lack of selection by Toxoplasma of these arboreal monkeys even though about 50% of terrestrial animals from the same area were infected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Significant improvements in the clinical and hematological parameters were observed in 547 (98%) of the unconfirmed VL cases. On the basis of the parasitological findings or positive response to specific anti-Leishmania chemotherapy, the sensitivity and specificity of the DAT were 99.6% and 97.7% respectively. The results supported the reliability of DAT for diagnosis of VL at levels below that of parasitological detection.\r"

Three patients completed therapy, healed their lesions, but relapsed at the six or 12 month follow-up. Three patients terminated therapy prematurely because of liver enzyme elevations in conjunction with either EKG abnormalities or musculoskeletal complaints; none of these patients were healed.

There was no relationship between the severity of nephropathy and intensity of parasitemia. The intensity of parasitemia was the same in the vaccinated and control groups.

When splenic hydatidosis was diagnosed, the spleen was the first and only localization of hydatid disease in three cases. One of these patients underwent surgery for a pulmonary cyst four years later. Splenic cysts were asymptomatic in six patients. The most frequent clinical sign of splenic hydatidosis was a painful mass in the left upper abdominal quadrant. Ultrasonography and axial computed tomography (axial C.T.) were the most useful diagnostic tools. The complications arising from splenic hydatidic cysts were infection, rupture in the abdominal cavity and fistulization to the colon. A splenectomy was performed in every case. There was no mortality and morbidity was principally related to the hepatic-associated hydatidosis. It is concluded that splenic involvement is a rare manifestation of hydatid disease but should be looked for in a systematic way in patients with this diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Skin lesions of leprosy have become a rich source of new information about the mechanisms involved in the uniquely broad spectrum of human responsiveness to M. leprae. Recent technological advances in immunology and molecular biology have been applied to the study of skin lesions using 3 approaches: immunohistologic studies of skin biopsies from leprosy lesions, correlated assessment of cell subsets and soluble immunologic mediators, and studies of the effects of the inoculation of exogenous lymphokines into the lesions. Results from these studies suggest that an immunologic equilibrium may exist among long-established lesions across the spectrum so that, although T-helper and -suppressor cells are present in different proportions, immunologic activity is at a low, similar level in all types of lesions. Exogenous lymphokines can alter this equilibrium and temporarily change the histologic picture. Spontaneous immunologic changes occurring in acute leprosy reactions may also lead to changes in T cell subsets and quantities of lymphokines.\r"

Experimental multibacillary leprosy was established in 24 of 36 mangabey monkeys, 7 of 34 rhesus monkeys, and 15 of 19 African green monkeys following intravenous and intradermal inoculation of Mycobacterium leprae. The experimental disease strongly resembles leprosy in humans clinically, histopathologically, and immunologically. Thus, in addition to nine-banded armadillos in Louisiana and Texas, chimpanzees and sooty mangabeys in Africa, in the wild or in captivity, may serve as a zoonotic source of M. leprae. Investigators using chimpanzees and monkeys should be alerted to the possibility of naturally-acquired leprosy.\r"

  ".W": "Analyses of recombinant proteins isolated from genomic libraries of pathogenic organisms represent the beginning of identifying immunologically-reactive epitopes. The induction of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to any pathogen begins with the uptake and processing of antigen by antigen-presenting cells and the display of specific epitopes to the immune system of the host. Little emphasis is placed on the molecular mechanisms underlying transport of foreign proteins into antigen-presenting cells and factors that influence degradation to the peptides which represent the epitopes that associate with newly synthesized class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex. These cellular processes are crucial to the design of any new generation vaccine. We describe our analysis of the 18 kDa protein antigen of Mycobacterium leprae and consider a possible role for antibody in antigen-processing. In both macrophage/dendritic cells and B lymphocytes, we suggest that antibody plays a directional role in antigen uptake, subcellular compartmentalization, and antigen degradation to yield peptides. These steps will all have an impact on the construction of new generation vaccines.\r"

A hematocrit of at least 25% was required for study participation. General endotracheal inhalational anesthesia, supplemented with neuromuscular blockade and controlled ventilation, was used. No barbiturates or opioids were administered. Respiratory pattern and heart rate were recorded for at least 12 h postoperatively using an impedance pneumograph. Tracings were analyzed for evidence of apnea, periodic breathing, and/or bradycardia by a pulmonologist unaware of the hematologic profile of the infant. Nineteen patients had a hematocrit of 30% or greater (group 1). Their mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) gestational age was 33.5 +/- 2.7 weeks and postconceptual age 45.5 +/- 4.6 weeks. Five infants had a hematocrit less than 30% (group 2). Their mean gestational age (+/- SD) was 32.4 +/- 3.2 weeks and postconceptual age 43.6 +/- 5.5 weeks. Anemic infants had an 80% incidence of postoperative apnea versus 21% in infants with a normal hematocrit (P less than .03). In the infants who developed postoperative prolonged apnea and/or bradycardia, a prior history of apnea was equally present in both groups (21% in group 1 and 20% in group 2). This study shows that anemia in former preterm infants can be associated with an increased incidence of postoperative apnea.\r"

The authors hypothesized that increased left ventricular (LV) wall stress during periods of spontaneous ventilation (SV) could alter myocardial perfusion in these patients. Using thallium-201 (201TI) myocardial scintigraphy, the authors studied the occurrence of myocardial perfusion abnormalities during periods of SV in 15 MV-dependent patients (nine women, six men; aged 71 +/- 7 yr, mean +/- SD). Fourteen of these patients were studied once with 201TI myocardial scintigraphy during intermittent mechanical ventilation (IMV) and again on another day, after at least 10 min of SV through a T-piece. One patient was studied during SV only. Thirteen of 14 of the patients (93%) studied during MV had abnormal patterns of initial myocardial 201TI uptake, but only 1 patient demonstrated redistribution of 201TI on delayed images. The remainder of the abnormalities observed during MV were fixed defects. SV produced significant alterations of myocardial 201TI distribution or transient LV dilation, or both, in 7 of the 15 patients (47%). Four patients demonstrated new regional decreases of LV myocardial thallium concentration with redistribution of the isotope on delayed images. The patient studied only during SV also had myocardial 201TI defects with redistribution. Five patients (3 also having areas of 201TI redistribution) had transient LV dilation during SV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The current study was designed to investigate the effect of glucose infusion on concentrations of plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), triglycerides, ketone bodies, and insulin and to determine whether the use of solutions containing less than 5% glucose would maintain physiologic plasma glucose concentrations during tympanoplasty lasting about 6 h. Forty-five children aged between 1.5 and 9 yr were divided randomly into three groups of 15 patients each to receive the following intravenous solutions: LR groups, lactated Ringer's solution (LR) alone; D2LR group, 2% glucose in LR; and D5LR group, 5% glucose in LR. All fluids were infused at a rate of 6 ml.kg-1.h-1 until 1 h after anesthesia. In the LR group, the plasma glucose concentrations remained unchanged perioperatively compared with basal values, whereas in the D2LR group they showed a gradual increase during surgery but remained normoglycemic. On the other hand, in the D5LR group, the plasma glucose concentrations increased markedly both during and after the operation. Furthermore, 3 of 15 patients showed hyperglycemia of more than 300 mg.dl-1 during anesthesia. There was no evidence of lipid mobilization or impaired secretion of insulin, since plasma NEFA, triglycerides, ketone bodies, and insulin remained within normal concentration ranges throughout the sample period in the three groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sixty unpremedicated outpatients undergoing elective extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using an unmodified Dornier HM-3 lithotriptor were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous infusion of either alfentanil or ketamine as an adjuvant to midazolam for sedation and analgesia. Although both drug regimens allowed the maximal number of shock waves and energy level, the alfentanil group had significantly better calculi fragmentation (78% vs. 50% of patients with fragments less than 2 mm). Ketamine infusion provided superior intraoperative cardiorespiratory stability; however, it was associated with more disruptive movements (22 vs. 5) and dreaming (35% vs. 5%) during the procedure (P less than 0.05). Postoperatively, confusion also occurred more frequently in the ketamine-treated patients (31% vs. 5%, P less than 0.05). Alfentanil infusion was associated with more episodes of hemoglobin oxygen desaturation to less than 90% (12 vs. 2, P less than 0.05), itching (23% vs. 4%, P less than 0.05), and ability to recall intraoperative events (45% vs. 12%, P less than 0.05). The incidence of postoperative nausea was decreased (not significantly) in the alfentanil group (32% vs. 54%). The mean anesthesia time was similar in both groups; however, discharge times (means +/- standard deviations) were shorter in the alfentanil group (142 +/- 42 min vs. 161 +/- 31 min, P = 0.05). These data suggest that although both techniques proved effective for anesthesia in outpatients undergoing immersion lithotripsy, alfentanil is superior to ketamine as part of a sedative-analgesic technique because of the improved recovery profile and calculi fragmentation.\r"

Three percent chloroprocaine (plain) was used as the local anesthetic. The epidural analgesia was allowed to dissipate following the T8 and T4 levels of block. After the C8 level the block was reinforced to study the effect of a \"top-up\" dose. Blood samples were drawn from a central venous catheter. Plasma concentrations of norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined by the single isotope radioenzymatic method. Despite extensive block, hemodynamic alterations were minimal, and no significant decrease in plasma epinephrine was observed as the level of analgesia was raised to the C8 dermatome. When the level of analgesia was raised above T8, there was a trend for norepinephrine to decrease, but this decrease did not become statistically significant until analgesia reached the C8 dermatome. Reinforcing the epidural block at the C8 level of analgesia resulted an insignificant decrease in epinephrine and norepinephrine NE. Under the conditions of the present study, epidural block with a sensory analgesia level as high as C8 did not significantly decrease the plasma concentration of epinephrine in unstressed volunteers. The plasma concentration of norepinephrine significantly decreased only when the level of sensory analgesia was approximately C8.\r"

Twenty patients had been treated with beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs for at least 3 weeks before the study; 11 unblocked patients served as control group. The extent of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade was quantified using the isoproterenol sensitivity test. The dose of isoproterenol required to increase heart rate by 25 beats per min was defined as the chronotropic dose 25 (CD25), representing the degree of beta-adrenoceptor blockade. Geometric mean CD25 per 70 kg was 3.0 micrograms in the control group and 21.8 micrograms in the patients receiving beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs. The authors found a significant inverse relationship between CD25 values and changes in cardiac index in response to three epinephrine infusion rates (0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 micrograms.kg-1.min-1), the correlation coefficients being -0.71, -0.81, and -0.86, respectively. Compared to unblocked patients, almost no change, or even a decrease, of the cardiac index was observed at greater degrees of clinical beta-adrenoceptor blockade, particularly in patients receiving nonselective blockers. Moreover, there was a significant linear correlation (r = 0.76-0.86) between CD25 values and the effects of epinephrine on systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI); i.e., SVRI significantly decreased in control patients but markedly increased in patients with high degrees of preoperative beta-adrenoceptor blockade. This unmasked vasoconstrictive response to low doses of epinephrine was observed despite the fact that the majority of our patients had received cardioselective adrenergic blocking drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Awake shunt (VA/Q less than 0.005) was 0.6 +/- 0.4% (+/- standard deviation [SD]) before, versus 3.9 +/- 2.0% after PI-3 infection (P less than 0.05). Awake arterial O2 tension (PaO2) was 139.9 +/- 14.0 mmHg before and 114.5 +/- 8.7 mmHg after infection (P less than 0.05). Mean PAP increased from 6.0 +/- 1.9 mmHg before to 11.5 +/- 1.6 mmHg after infection (P less than 0.05). Anesthesia shunt increased to 5.7 +/- 2.3% before and 11.2 +/- 3.4% after PI-3 (P less than 0.05 for the change from awake, and P less than 0.05 for a PI-3 anesthesia shunt difference). PAP was not significantly different from awake, either before or after infection. Anesthesia also produced an average 14.8 +/- 3.8% FRC reduction before and 17.4 +/- 6.4% reduction after infection (P less than 0.05 for FRC reduction with anesthesia, not significantly different for PI-3). Three of the six sheep developed shunt at higher FRCs after infection, both awake and during anesthesia; however, the average slope of the shunt/FRC response to anesthesia was unchanged, suggesting that this was not a neurogenic form of auto-PEEP. We therefore conclude that viral infection significantly enhanced the pulmonary effects of anesthesia.\r"

  ".W": "Volatile anesthetics inhibit phagocytic cell function, yet little is known about their effects on target tissues or on the target tissue response to stimulated phagocytes. Experiments were performed to determine how exposure to halothane and isoflurane changes rat pulmonary artery endothelial cell (RPAEC) viability in response to the toxic oxygen metabolites produced by stimulated phagocytic cells. RPAECs were grown in monolayer culture. The monolayers were treated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) -stimulated human neutrophils at an effector-to-target ratio of 20:1 after equilibration with 0.4% or 1.7% halothane or 0.7% or 2.8% isoflurane. As measured by percent-specific release of incorporated 51Cr label (mean +/- SE), cytotoxicity in the presence of 1.7% halothane (75.3 +/- 3.4%) was significantly greater (P less than 0.02) than cytotoxicity in 5% CO2 in air (44.7 +/- 3.3%) and in 0.4% halothane (57.3 +/- 4.7%). Also, cytotoxicity in 1.7% halothane was significantly greater than in 0.4% halothane (P less than 0.02). The authors found that RPAECs incubated in isoflurane exhibited significantly greater release of 51Cr than cells incubated in the MAC equivalent concentrations of halothane: 78.2 +/- 2.6% in 0.7% isoflurane (P = 0.0004) and 83.8 +/- 1% in 2.8% isoflurane (P = 0.005). Because early neutrophil cytotoxicity has been found to be mediated primarily by hydroxyl radical (HO.) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the authors measured H2O2 production by similar numbers of PMA-stimulated neutrophils under similar exposure conditions. In carrier gas, PMA-stimulated neutrophils produced 20.5 +/- 1.3 nmol H2O2.10(6) cells-1.h-1. At the higher concentrations of halothane, H2O2 production actually was inhibited in comparison with carrier gas (15.4 +/- 1.4 nmol H2O2.10(6) cells-1.h-1 in 1.7% halothane and 16.8 +/- 0.8 in 2.8% halothane), but the degree of inhibition did not reach statistical significance. In isoflurane, however, H2O2 production was not different from that seen in carrier gas. In other experiments, the monolayers were treated with 0, 200, 500, and 1,000 microM H2O2 after equilibration with 0.4%, 1.7%, and 2.8% halothane or 0.7%, 2.8%, and 5% isoflurane in 5% CO2 in air. Efficiency of replating was used to measure degree of injury. Both halothane and isoflurane enhance the sensitivity of the RPAEC monolayers to injury by H2O2. The sensitizing effect of halothane was reversed by removing the anesthetic. Halothane and isoflurane thus enhance RPAEC sensitivity to injury by both H2O2 and PMA-stimulated neutrophils. In increasing RPAEC sensitivity to injury by oxygen metabolites, halothane and isoflurane may be inhibiting processes involved in intracellular antioxidant defenses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Basophil granulocytes released less than 5% of their histamine content when incubated with any one of the muscle relaxants tested. In contrast, mast cells showed a significant heterogeneity in response to different muscle relaxants. Succinylcholine did not induce histamine release from any type of mast cell, and only high concentrations of d-tubocurarine (10(-3) M) caused histamine release from skin and lung mast cells. Vecuronium concentration-dependently induced histamine release from skin and lung--but not from heart mast cells--to a maximum of 7.2 +/- 2.1% and 4.9 +/- 1.4%, respectively. Atracurium concentration-dependently caused significant histamine release from skin and lung mast cells to a maximum of 46.2 +/- 15.1% and 30.6 +/- 6.0%, respectively. Atracurium (5 x 10(-5) - 2 x 10(-4) M) also induced histamine release from heart mast cells. The histamine release process from both lung and skin mast cells caused by atracurium and vecuronium was extremely rapid (t1/2 = less than 1 min). The releasing activity of atracurium and vecuronium on lung and skin mast cells was not reduced, and not abolished, by lowering the temperature of the incubation buffer to 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Extracellular calcium did not affect the capacity of atracurium and vecuronium to induce histamine release from lung and skin mast cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of these anesthetics on left ventricular pressure (LVP), CF, percentage of O2 extraction, O2 delivery (DO2), and myocardial O2 consumption (MVO2) were examined in 47 isolated guinea pig hearts perfused at constant pressure. An increase in DO2 from control relative to MVO2 was used to indicate attenuation of autoregulation, and a decrease in MVO2 relative to DO2 to indicate a reduction of myocardial work and O2 utilization. Each heart was exposed to 0.51, 0.70, and 1.20 vol% halothane (n = 16); 0.91, 1.41, and 2.04 vol% enflurane (n = 16); or 0.45, 0.87, and 1.22 vol% isoflurane (n = 15). Adenosine (2 mM) was given to test maximal CF in arrested and in paced hearts. Mean results for increasing concentrations of each agent were as follows: LVP (average control 92 +/- 5 mmHg) (standard error of mean [SEM]) decreased by 15%,* 25%,* and 34%* with halothane; 13%,* 24%,* and 34%* with enflurane; and only 3%, 7%, and 13%* with isoflurane (*P less than 0.05 vs. controls).

Diastolic function has been shown to significantly influence systolic performance, but the effects of volatile anesthetics on diastolic function have not been extensively examined. Since autonomic nervous system function may significantly influence hemodynamic actions of anesthetics in vivo, experiments were performed in the presence of pharmacologic blockade of the autonomic nervous system. Three groups comprising a total of 23 experiments were performed using 11 dogs instrumented for measurement of aortic and left ventricular pressure, rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt), subendocardial segment length, and cardiac output. Systemic hemodynamics were recorded in the conscious state and after 30 min equilibration at 1.0 and 1.5 MAC desflurane, isoflurane, or halothane. Ventricular relaxation was described using invasively derived time constants of isovolumetric relaxation with zero (To) or nonzero (Tn) assumptions of asymptotic decay. Chamber and myocardial stiffness the viscoelastic properties of the ventricle, were described using exponential relationships relating ventricular pressure to segment length and end-diastolic pressure to Lagrangian strain, respectively. Desflurane produced a significant (P less than 0.05) and dose-dependent increase in isovolumetric relaxation as a evaluated by both time constants (To, 22.2 +/- 2.0 during control to 33.9 +/- 3.5 ms at 1.5 MAC; Tn, 33.1 +/- 1.6 during control to 45.1 +/- 4.3 ms at 1.5 MAC). Similar degrees of prolongation of isovolumetric relaxation were produced by isoflurane (Tn, 35.6 +/- 1.5 during control to 47.1 +/- 2.9 ms at 1.5 MAC) and halothane (Tn, 31.7 +/- 2.2 during control to 42.3 +/- 3.9 ms at 1.5 MAC). Halothane also caused an increase in regional passive chamber stiffness (Kp, 0.46 +/- 0.07 during control to 0.88 +/- 0.17 mm-1 at 1.5 MAC) indicating a decrease in ventricular compliance. No changes in chamber stiffness were observed with desflurane or isoflurane. In addition, no significant changes in myocardial stress-strain relationships as evaluated by nonlinear elastic coefficients, alpha (gain) and beta (myocardial stiffness), were observed with any anesthetic. Although the effects of volatile anesthetics on systolic function could not be entirely excluded from the analysis, the results indicated that desflurane, isoflurane, and halothane produce equivalent degrees of prolongation of isovolumetric relaxation. Halothane also caused a decrease in compliance during passive filling as evaluated by chamber stiffness, but no change in compliance was observed at end diastole as assessed by stress-strain relationships.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Initial studies included the measurement of lung resistance (RL) and dynamic compliance (Cdyn) with and without propranolol pretreatment in 5 BG and 5 mongrel dogs. A single dose of propranolol (2 mg/kg) did not significantly alter airway reactivity in the mongrels. The dose of methacholine needed to increase RL by 200% (ED200RL) was 0.20 +/- 0.05 mg/ml (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]) in untreated and 0.18 +/- 0.04 mg/ml in propranolol-treated mongrels. In contrast, propranol significantly increased methacholine-reactivity in the BGs. The ED200RL for methacholine was 0.17 +/- 0.03 mg/ml in untreated and 0.05 +/- 0.02 mg/ml (P less than 0.05) in propranolol-treated BG dogs. Following the initial studies, the 5 BG dogs were given methylprednisolone (2 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 4 weeks, after which time propranolol no longer increased methylacholine reactivity in the BGs. The ED200RL was 0.16 +/- 0.03 mg/ml after 4 weeks of methylprednisolone and 0.22 +/- 0.06 mg/ml after propranolol administration in the BGs given 4 weeks of methylprednisolone treatment. The attenuation of propranolol-induced bronchoconstriction by corticosteroids may be a clinically useful intervention in asthmatic patients receiving beta-adrenergic antagonists in the perioperative period. However, further studies are needed to define the effective dose and duration of corticosteroid therapy that is needed.\r"

  ".W": "Since blockers of excitatory transmission have been shown to reduce anoxic and ischemic neuronal damage, augmentation of inhibitory transmission by agents such as midazolam might have a similar protective effect. Rat hippocampal slices were maintained in vitro and used to determine whether and by what mechanism midazolam improves recovery of evoked responses after anoxia. The Schaffer collateral pathway in the slice was stimulated electrically, and an extracellular potential, the evoked population spike, was recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cells, which are postsynaptic. The slices were made anoxic by substituting artificial cerebrospinal fluid aerated with 95% nitrogen-5% carbon dioxide for fluid aerated with 95% oxygen-5% carbon dioxide. Percentage recovery was expressed as the amplitude of the evoked population spike 60 min after anoxia divided by its preanoxic amplitude. Protection in this model is defined as a significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in percentage recovery compared to the recovery of untreated slices. There was no recovery of the response recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells after 5 min of anoxia (4 +/- 2%) (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). Slices were treated with midazolam 10 min before, during, and 10 min after anoxia. Midazolam (1 microM) did not enhance recovery after anoxia when dissolved either in water (3 +/- 3%) or in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1 +/- 1%). A higher concentration of midazolam (100 microM) did enhance recovery when dissolved in DMSO (27 +/- 7%) but not when dissolved in water (5 +/- 2%). To test whether prolonged pretreatment with midazolam dissolved in water would enhance recovery, slices were treated for 30 min prior to anoxia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

I believe our specialty is in a golden era that will benefit from the past and be nourished by new discoveries and understanding. We as clinicians must accept the challenge of recognizing what new information deserves incorporation into our practice, what old information deserves to be sustained, and what merits new scrutiny and perhaps should be discarded. If I had one wish, it would be that anesthesiologists would never lose their zeal to be students--their thirst for new information--as the continuum of anesthesia education is indeed a life-long process. That wish, ladies and gentlemen, is my challenge to all anesthesiologists.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous magnesium supplementation is often used to control cardiac arrhythmias and coronary artery vasospasm resulting from disturbances of magnesium homeostasis after coronary artery bypass surgery. Many such patients also require inotropic drug support of depressed myocardial function. However, increased serum magnesium concentrations directly depress cardiac contractility in animals and may interfere with catecholamine actions. To determine whether small intravenous doses of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) interfere with the cardiotonic actions of epinephrine, we examined the hemodynamic effects of MgSO4 and epinephrine infusion in 17 cardiac surgical patients on their 1st postoperative day in a prospective, controlled study. In 11 patients, infusion of MgSO4 (7-mg.kg-1 bolus followed by 10 mg.kg-1.h-1 as a continuous infusion) increased serum magnesium concentrations by 44% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM] of 0.8 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.1 mM; P less than 0.01) but had no significant effect on heart rate; mean arterial, central venous, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressures; or cardiac output. Epinephrine infusion (30 ng.kg-1.min-1) significantly increased cardiac index (2.7 +/- 0.1 to 3.1 +/- 0.21.min-1.m-2; P less than 0.05); this effect was not altered by MgSO4 administration (n = 11). However, MgSO4 significantly blunted epinephrine's hypertensive action and prevented a significant increase in mean arterial pressure during concurrent MgSO4-epinephrine administration. Six placebo control patients were given two sequential infusions of epinephrine separated by a placebo infusion to rule out an effect of time on the hemodynamic response to epinephrine. Mean arterial pressure and cardiac index responses to epinephrine were identical before and after placebo infusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this randomized, double-blinded study, we investigated the effects of desmopressin on hemodynamics, coagulation, and postoperative blood loss in patients undergoing primary elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). After reversal of heparin effect, 20 patients received desmopressin 0.3 micrograms.kg-1, infused over 15 min, and 20 patients received a placebo. Desmopressin produced a small but significant decrease in diastolic blood pressure when compared with the placebo (50.8 mmHg vs. 57.6 mmHg for the desmopressin- and placebo-treated groups, respectively; P = 0.0372). A 20% or greater decrease in mean arterial pressure was observed in 7 of 20 patients receiving desmopressin, whereas only one patient in the placebo-treated group experienced a decrease of this magnitude (P = 0.0177). Reductions in arterial pressure were secondary to decreases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (mean SVR before and after the drug infusion, 1,006 and 766 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the desmopressin-treated group; and 994 and 1,104 dyn.s.cm-5, respectively, for the placebo-treated group; P = 0.0078).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In each patient, anesthesia was induced with thiopental 4.0 mg.kg-1, and after the effect of succinylcholine had dissipated, isoflurane 0.3% end-tidal concentration in 70% nitrous oxide was begun to maintain anesthesia. The isoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of preoperative values, and fentanyl was given if the end-tidal isoflurane concentration exceeded 1.5%. In all groups, blood pressure and heart rate increased after tracheal intubation. However, the increase in blood pressure and heart rate was significantly less in the higher dexmedetomidine (0.6 micrograms.kg-1) group than in the saline group (P less than 0.01). Also, the postintubation increase in heart rate was significantly less (P less than 0.05) in the dexmedetomidine 0.6 micrograms.kg-1 group (increase of 18 +/- 3 beats per min) compared to the fentanyl group (increase of 26 +/- 3 beats per min). In patients receiving dexmedetomidine 0.3 micrograms.kg-1, the increase in blood pressure or heart rate did not differ from that of the saline group.

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Revascularizing procedures like percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) aim at reducing the incidence and severity of myocardial ischemia. To evaluate this, continuous Holter ST analysis is a possible method. DESIGN: 41 patients (35 men, 6 women) with stable angina pectoris had continuous twenty-four-hour two-channel Holter registration (V5/aVF-analogous leads) recorded before and after PTCA. Transient myocardial ischemia (TM) was defined as 0.1 mV ST depression or more 80 msec after the J point for one minute or more. FINDINGS: PTCA was successful for 37 patients (90%). Eleven of these had a total of 53 episodes of TM, 36 (68%) before and 17 (32%) after PTCA (p less than 0.05). Fifteen episodes (28%) were symptomatic, and 38 (72%) were asymptomatic. Six patients had TM after successful PTCA, 5 of whom had one-vessel disease and a clinically uncomplicated course. One patient had multivessel disease, with only one vessel dilated. Follow-up angiograms for 9 of the 11 patients with TM revealed 5 restenoses. There was no significant correlation between TM after PTCA and subsequent restenosis (p greater than 0.05). IMPLICATIONS: TM is common in patients with stable angina pectoris. The incidence significantly decreases after successful PTCA, but TM is seen also with a clinically uncomplicated course. In multivessel disease this is consistent with incomplete revascularization, whereas in single-vessel disease the most likely cause is intermittent spasm or thrombosis. TM after successful PTCA does not seem to be a predictor of restenosis.\r"

Among 569 consecutive patients who underwent CABG surgery in the same institution, a total of 80 cases from Group A and 80 cases from Group B were selected for this study after application of exclusion criteria. Excluded from this study were the following: patients with preexisting or prior history of SVTs, significant left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40%), postoperative myocardial infarction, drug toxicity or electrolyte imbalance, and advanced chronic obstructive lung disease. Group A consisted of 63 men and 17 women and Group B consisted of 52 men and 28 women. All patients were monitored either in ICU or by telemetry for a period of three to six days after surgery and all had a predischarge 12-lead electrocardiogram. Both groups were fairly comparable in most of their clinical profile and number of grafts. The incidence of SVTs in Group A was 31% (25 of 80 patients) and in Group B was 24% (19 of 80 patients). Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative pericarditis was noted in 35% (28 of 80 patients) of Group A and in 19% (15 of 80 patients) in Group B. The authors conclude that male tobacco smokers of Group A tended to have a significantly higher incidence of postoperative pericarditis with a higher trend for postoperative SVTs than patients from Group B.\r"

The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents. Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic. Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes. Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly. The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication. In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies. The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively.\r"

Aortic cusps thickening was found in 11 Group 1 (48%) and 2 Group 2 (9%) patients (p less than 0.001). Aortic root and aortic arch size were similar in the two groups. Maximum aortic flow velocity was significantly greater in Group 1 (200 60 cm/sec) than in Group 2 (120 20 cm/sec) (p less than 0.001). Left ventricular outflow systolic maximum velocity was similar in the two groups. A bilateral neck murmur was heard in 10/23 Group 1 patients (43%); in this group, patients with cervical SM had a greater maximum aortic flow velocity than those without cervical SM (230 + 60 cm/sec vs 172 + 32 cm/sec, p less than 0.001). In Group 1, 3 patients had a cervical SM louder on one neck side; only in these 3 patients were ipsilateral obstructive CA plaques found. A unilateral neck SM was heard in 4/22 Group 2 patients (18%); in these 4, ipsilateral obstructive CA were found. Conclusions: (1) in the elderly, precordial ejection SM is related to mild increase in maximum aortic flow velocity and thickening of aortic cusps; (2) in patients with precordial SM radiated to both neck sides, maximum aortic flow velocity tends to be more markedly increased; (3) in patients with precordial SM, a cervical SM louder on one neck side should suggest coexistent ipsilateral CA stenosis.\r"

The mechanism of action of CGRP is still, however, not clear, and in particular it is not known whether vasodilation by CGRP occurs by changes in cutaneous or in muscular blood flow, or both. The aim of the study was, therefore, to evaluate the cutaneous and muscular blood flow, at rest and after ischemic test, induced by an IV bolus 25 micrograms human CGRP infusion in 5 healthy normotensive volunteers, using a strain gauge plethysmographic procedure with venous occlusion. Human CGRP provoked a transient but significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, associated with tachycardia, marked flushing, a significant increase in plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, and cyclic AMP levels, and a slight, but significant, decrease in serum total calcium. Moreover, a significant increase in the carpal cutaneous blood flow at rest was observed, with no significant change in the lower extremity muscular blood flow at rest and after ischemic test. Finally human CGRP produced a significant increase in the venous partial O2 pressure and in the hematocrit and a significant decrease in the venous partial CO2 pressure. The results of the present study confirm the acute cardiovascular and metabolic effects of CGRP. In fact, hypotension, tachycardia, flushing, and the increased cutaneous blood flow indicate a systemic vasodilation by the neuropeptide, with a secondary sympathetic response, as documented by the augmented catecholamine and cyclic AMP plasma levels.\r"

Limbs with CVI due to primary varicose veins showed a higher expelled volume and a more shortened refilling time than limbs with simple varicosities. With application of tourniquets, the refilling time normalized in limbs with CVI, as well as in limbs with simple varicosities. These results indicate that a high degree of venous congestion in the distal part of the calf and valvular incompetence of the superficial vein system might cause CVI due to primary varicose veins.\r"

Conditions secondary to connective tissue disorders did not demonstrate much improvement based on instrumental data alone, possibly because of the intrinsic limitations of the techniques used for evaluating peripheral blood flow.

Thirty-seven PVOD patients (mean age 69.2 +/- 0.8 years) rested supine for twenty minutes, followed by a progressive treadmill walking test at a constant speed of 2 mph. The initial grade was 0%; this increased 2% every two minutes until maximal claudication pain (n = 19) or until the occurrence of such limiting symptoms as volitional fatigue (n = 6), ST segment depression (n = 4), dyspnea (n = 3), multiple premature ventricular contractions (n = 2), and angina (n = 2). Patients then rested supine for fifteen minutes. Foot TcPO2 was recorded before, during, and after exercise, whereas ankle SBP was measured before and after exercise. At rest, a curvilinear relationship was found between foot TcPO2 and ankle SBP (foot TcPO2 = 41.89 + 0.22(ankle SBP) + 0.0005 (ankle SBP2); SEE = 9.2, R = 0.64, R2 = 0.41, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the relationship was stronger and more linear during recovery, particularly at the sixth minute (foot TcPO2) = 8.33 + 0.35 (ankle SBP); SEE = 13.6, R = 0.86, R2 = 0.73, p less than 0.001). At rest, foot TcPO2 and ankle SBP characterized different aspects of PVOD because they shared only 41% common variance. During recovery, they provided similar information because up to 73% of the variance was shared. It is concluded that foot TcPO2 should also be used to assess PVOD patients because unique information is obtained at rest and values can be recorded during exercise.\r"

No relationship existed between the side of bruit and side of symptoms in those with lateralized symptoms. The authors found more severe degrees of carotid stenosis in two symptomatic groups (vertebrobasilar insufficiency [VBI] and definite lateralized) compared with asymptomatic patients. Those with VBI had more high-grade stenosis, whereas those with lateralized symptoms had more occlusions, which tended to be ipsilateral to the symptoms.\r"

  ".W": "During the past decade, technological advances have made it possible to measure regional cerebral hemodynamics in individual patients. Studies performed with these techniques have demonstrated that the degree of carotid stenosis correlates poorly with the hemodynamic status of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation. The primary determinant of cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow under these circumstances is the adequacy of collateral circulatory pathways. Since collateral circulation varies from patient to patient, there is no critical degree of carotid stenosis that consistently produces hemodynamic compromise of the cerebral circulation. It is, thus, time to abandon the concept of the hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis as it relates to the pathogenesis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Measurements of regional cerebral hemodynamics have provided new insight into the pathogenesis of transient ischemic attacks and generated some preliminary data on the prognostic and therapeutic importance of chronic reductions in regional cerebral perfusion pressure. Further investigations into the importance of hemodynamic factors in ischemic stroke can now be based on accurate assessment of cerebral (not carotid or vertebrobasilar) hemodynamics in the context of other coexisting epidemiological, clinical, hematological, and angiographic risk factors.\r"

  ".W": "The serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 8 women with ataxia, 6 of whom also had eye movement abnormalities believed to be opsoclonus, were found to contain a highly specific antineuronal antibody we call anti-Ri. Seven of the 8 women also had or developed cancer: carcinoma of the breast in 5, adenocarcinoma in an axillary lymph node in 1, and carcinoma of the fallopian tube in 1. Four patients presented with the neurological disorder; the cancer was diagnosed first in the other 4. Immunohistochemical studies using serum or CSF from all 8 patients revealed a highly specific antibody interaction with central nervous system neuronal nuclei but not with glial or other cells; the titer ranged from 1:5,000 to 1:320,000 in serum and from 1:2,000 to 1:16,000 in CSF. Biotinylated IgG from the patients' serum reacted with the tumors of 3 of 4 patients with anti-Ri antibody but not with breast cancers from patients without anti-Ri antibody. Immunoblots against cerebral cortex neuronal extracts identified protein antigens of 55-kd and 80-kd relative molecular mass. Serum titers by immunoblot ranged from 1:500 to more than 1:40,000 and CSF titers, from 1:10 to 1:2,000. The relative amount of anti-Ri was always higher in CSF than in serum. The antibody was not present in sera from normal individuals; patients with breast cancer without opsoclonus; other patients with opsoclonus; or patients with other paraneoplastic syndromes related to breast, ovarian, or small-cell lung cancer. We conclude that the presence of anti-Ri antibody identifies a subset of patients with paraneoplastic ataxia and eye movement disorders (opsoclonus) who usually suffer from breast or other gynecological cancer; the antibody when present is a useful marker for an underlying malignancy.\r"

In an attempt to better understand the mode of transmission, parent-child concordance for MS was studied in two large, population-based MS clinic populations. Among 75 parent-child pairs concordant for MS, we found 40 mother-daughter pairs, 13 mother-son pairs, 21 father-daughter pairs, and 1 father-son pair. Controlling for the known female preponderance in MS, the data show a paucity of father-son pairs. These data have implications for understanding the mechanisms of inheritance for MS susceptibility as well as for risk counseling in families of patients.\r"

  ".U": "91254006\r", 
  ".W": "Cholinergic replacement therapies have yielded little or no clinical improvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since the number of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors remains unchanged in the cerebral cortex, the involvement of other neurotransmitter systems may account for this limited efficacy. Alternatively, there may be a defective coupling of the muscarinic receptor with its nucleotide-binding protein in AD, which would severely limit the ability of cholinergic agonists to activate intracortical second messengers. To address this possibility, we assessed the ability of the putative M1 muscarinic receptor to form high-affinity agonist-receptor complexes with guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins in postmortem frontal cortex. Agonist affinity states of the M1 muscarinic receptor were measured by carbachol/[3H]-pirenzepine competition. M1 muscarinic receptors exhibited both high (KH) and low (KL) affinities for the agonist carbachol. High-affinity agonist binding to M1 receptors in postmortem frontal cortex samples from subjects with AD was reduced, demonstrated by an increase in the KH value. Low-affinity agonist binding (KL value) was unchanged in AD and was not significantly different from the KL value for the uncoupled receptor determined in the presence of guanine nucleotides. The increase in the KH value resulted in a 70% decrease in the average KL/KH ratio for AD as compared to control samples. Choline acetyltransferase activities correlated significantly with the KL/KH ratios (r = 0.73, p less than 0.001). These data suggest that the KL/KH ratio for muscarinic agonists may serve as a neurochemical marker of disease severity. The reduced ability of the M1 receptor subtype to form a high-affinity agonist state in AD may account for the failure of cholinergic replacement therapies to improve specific features of memory and cognition.\r"

We evaluated 12 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, computed tomography scans, clinical neurological examinations, and neuropsychological tests. Regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (rCMRGlc) values for white matter were lower in the older long-term survivors (greater than 18 years old) treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy than in normal control subjects or survivors who had been treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. The ratio of white matter: cortex rCMRGlc values was lower than control values in the long-term survivors treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy, regardless of age, but not in those treated with intrathecal chemotherapy alone. By contrast, thalamic rCMRGlc values were lower than control values in older survivors regardless of treatment, and the ratio for thalamus:cortex rCMRGlc values was lower in all the treatment groups than in the control subjects. The highest rCMRGlc values were found in the youngest children, indicating an important effect of age on cerebral glucose metabolism. No neuropsychological deficits were identified in patients treated only with intrathecal chemotherapy; however, lower IQ scores were found in the long-term survivors who had been treated with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy. Treatment of the central nervous system with cranial radiation and intrathecal chemotherapy may cause prolonged alterations in white-matter and thalamic rCMRGlc, which may permit the identification and assessment of neurotoxicity in long-term survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography.\r"

This procedure results in a 50 to 75% reduction in endoneurial blood flow within the distal sciatic nerve as measured by the iodoantipyrine method. Nerve conduction velocities in sciatic nerves ipsilateral to the shunt fell by 25 to 30% within 2 weeks after creation of the shunt and did not recover for up to 10 months after the procedure. Morphological studies of the ischemic nerves showed structural abnormalities at nodes of Ranvier and mild axonal atrophy. Neither segmental demyelination nor axonal degeneration were evident. These results indicate that reduced endoneurial blood flow, insufficient to cause infarction, may result in measurable functional and morphological abnormalities in peripheral nerves.\r"

Combining conventional histopathological and immunocytochemical staining with neuronal counts, a peculiar form of neuronal pathology was characterized. Although neurons and neurites in the lateral tuberal nucleus of AD specimens were heavily stained by Alz-50, silver and thioflavine-S stains disclosed few neurofibrillary tangles or neurites. The numbers of neurons in the lateral tuberal nucleus of patients with AD (67,450; SEM = 5,050) were no different from those of control subjects (58,900; SEM = 2,450). In the AD patients, few plaques were present and were almost exclusively of the amorphous variety. We conclude that neurons in the lateral tuberal nucleus show an early stage of AD-related cytoskeletal pathology (Alz-50 positivity), but without plaques or neuronal death.\r"

There was no change in peripheral nervous system myelin as shown by immunostaining for Po glycoprotein. Double immunoperoxidase staining for herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens and glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that most of the infected cells were astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was completely lost in the inferior medial portion of the trigeminal root entry zone at 6 days after herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculation, a time when central nervous system myelin was preserved as indicated by immunostaining for myelin basic protein. The pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining did not change and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were no longer detected after day 8. There was a progressive loss of myelin basic protein staining within the area unstained by glial fibrillary acidic protein antisera on days 8 to 14. This pattern of astrocyte loss before central nervous system demyelination is strikingly different from the reactive astrocytosis seen in other demyelinating lesions, such as acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or acute multiple sclerosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice provides an unusual model of acute central nervous system demyelination preceded by a loss of astrocytes.\r"

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an abnormal cortical-white matter architectonic pattern in 2 patients with moderate cortical dysplasia. In the remaining 3 patients, magnetic resonance imaging findings were unremarkable.

Forty-four percent of these patients had significant levels of antibody (30-1,466 pM) compared with healthy control individuals (less than 15 pM). The incidence of positive sera in patients without associated small cell lung carcinoma (61%) was greater than in those patients with small cell lung carcinoma (28%). Results correlated strongly with results obtained using voltage-gated calcium channels extracted from the small cell lung carcinoma line, MAR5. Anti-voltage-gated calcium channel antibody titers did not correlate with disease severity across individuals, but longitudinal studies in 2 patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy showed a clear inverse relation between antibody titer and an electromyographic index of disease severity. The incidence of positive sera among patients with other neurological disorders was not significant, but 8 of 12 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had raised titers (30-82 pM). We conclude that the antibodies detected in this assay are heterogeneous and that some of them are likely to be implicated in this disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The assay should prove useful as an additional diagnostic aid in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome.\r"

Left-handers had a significantly lesser degree of leftward planum temporale asymmetry than right-handers. Thus, a structural-functional relation exists in cerebral asymmetry. The correlation is likely to reflect language representation. Because familial sinistrality influenced the anatomical pattern in left-handers and planum temporale asymmetry is already present in the newborn, prenatal factors must play an important role in the development of functional laterality.\r"

A further 4 relatives, now decreased, were affected by history. Overall, 25% of index patients had relatives with dystonia. The results of segregation analysis suggested the presence of an autosomal dominant gene or genes with reduced penetrance as a common cause for focal dystonia. Segregation ratios were not significantly different from those ratios observed in generalized or segmental dystonia in the United Kingdom, and it is possible that a single autosomal dominant gene mutation is responsible for inherited dystonia in the majority of patients irrespective of distribution or severity.\r"

The concentrations of somatostatin, cholecystokinin octapeptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and dynorphin A 1-17 were determined in hippocampal tissue resected from patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy, a common seizure disorder originating in or near the hippocampus. Control tissue was obtained from cadavera or epilepsy patients in whom the hippocampus was removed during the resection of temporal lobe tumors. Peptide determinations were performed on extracts of punch biopsy specimens taken from six different hippocampal regions. A significant decrease in immunoreactive somatostatin concentration was identified in the dentate gyrus and in region cornu ammonis 4 of cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy specimens. No significant changes were present in any other hippocampal region or in the levels of other peptides. In situ hybridization studies performed on cryostat sections from similar patients confirmed a marked loss of neurons expressing the somatostatin gene, which was restricted to the dentate hilus. The density of specific 125I-somatostatin binding to cryostat sections, as determined by semiquantitative in vitro autoradiography, was significantly increased in the dentate gyrus of the cryptogenic epilepsy patients, compared with tumor control specimens. We conclude that a loss of somatostatin-producing interneurons with an upregulation of dentate somatostatin receptors is a specific and characteristic element in the pathophysiology of human cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsy.\r"

The findings from a number of surgical series of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty are summarized. Certain trends are evident. Perioperative mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and other complications, while declining, remain somewhat higher in elderly patients. However, the impact of age alone is slight. In both coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, complications are more closely correlated with the presence of serious concomitant disease. Long-term survival and pain relief after coronary artery bypass grafting are excellent in older patients, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may be the treatment of choice in some elderly patients with coronary artery disease. As in younger patients, prolongation of survival should not be the exclusive goal. Rather, a focus on quality of life and freedom from dependency should be seriously considered.\r"

Although 71% of the physicians had cared for a patient with AIDS and 90% had been involved in ordering the human immunodeficiency virus antibody test, only about a third of them took appropriate sexual histories of new patients and only about a quarter (28%) counseled new patients about reducing the risk of contracting AIDS. Multivariate analysis revealed that physician knowledge about AIDS prevention was associated with younger age, more positive attitude toward homosexual males and intravenous drug users, confidence that counseling would result in behavioral change among patients, and specialty other than obstetrics-gynecology. Results indicate a need for increased training and education of primary care physicians about AIDS prevention.\r"

In 31 of the 33 cases, hospital costs for the entire admission exceeded reimbursements, with a median net loss of $5800 per case. Eleven randomly selected pneumonia cases were compared with control patients matched by diagnosis related group, age, sex, and service. Cases had significantly longer hospital stays, had greater total hospital costs, and caused greater net losses than did matched controls. We conclude that hospitals are seldom reimbursed adequately for Medicare patients who develop nosocomial pneumonia. With the advent of the prospective payment system, hospitals now have substantial financial incentives for implementing cost-effective measures for preventing nosocomial pneumonias.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the incidence and clinical features of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis after cardiac transplantation, we identified 27 (16%) of 171 consecutive recipients in whom CMV pneumonitis was confirmed by strict diagnostic criteria. Cytomegalovirus pneumonitis occurred in 6 (30%) of 20 patients treated with azathioprine and prednisone, and 8 (25%) of 32 patients treated with azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone, but only 13 (11%) of 119 patients treated with cyclosporine and prednisone. The incidence of CMV pneumonitis was not related to recipient preoperative CMV titers or to postoperative cardiac rejection, but there was a trend toward increased CMV pneumonitis in patients who received organs from CMV-positive donors. Mean onset of CMV pneumonitis was 2.9 +/- 1.6 (SD) months after transplantation. In the azathioprine-prednisone group, CMV was always associated with at least one other respiratory pathogen (Aspergillus, n = 5; Pneumocystis carinii, n = 2). In the two cyclosporine groups, CMV was either the sole respiratory pathogen (n = 9), or associated with P carinii (n = 11). Roentgenographically, diffuse bilateral hazy pulmonary opacities were present in 19 (70%) of 27 patients, but focal subsegmental opacity (26%), small pleural effusion (26%), and lobar consolidation (7%) were also observed. When bronchoscopy was performed, bronchoalveolar lavage was the most sensitive technique for detecting CMV (72%), whereas transbronchial biopsy (39%) and combined washings and brushings (33%) were relatively insensitive techniques. Respiratory failure and death occurred in 52% and 44%, respectively, of patients with CMV pneumonitis. In this population of immunocompromised hosts: (1) CMV pneumonitis, alone or with other respiratory pathogens, was a major cause of morbidity and mortality; (2) localized roentgenographic opacity did not exclude CMV pneumonitis; (3) bronchoalveolar lavage was the most sensitive bronchoscopic technique for detecting CMV pneumonitis.\r"

There was good overall correlation between all of these objective measures and weekly mean capillary glucose values. However, considerable scatter was seen in the data such that none of the glycated protein measurements was an ideal predictor of home glucose values. For example, all markedly elevated home glucose levels (greater than 11.1 mmol/L) were associated with elevated glycated protein levels, but moderately high blood glucose levels (8.3 to 11.1 mmol/L) were associated with one or more normal glycated protein values in some patients. Similar correlations were obtained whether glycemia was estimated by 1-week or 6-week home averages. Random serum glucose level also correlated with average home glucose level; however, there was wide fluctuation within individual subjects. All three glycated protein measurements (hemoglobin A1c, glycated hemoglobin, and fructosamine) appear equally useful as a supplement to home glucose monitoring in the assessment of glycemic control. Of the three types of glycated protein assays, fructosamine, with its advantage of speed and simplicity, may offer a more cost-effective alternative.\r"

During 8 years of follow-up (889 255 person-years), we identified 338 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 111 coronary deaths, 259 strokes, 238 cardiovascular deaths, and 1349 deaths from all causes. Diabetes was associated with a markedly increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3 to 8.4), ischemic stroke (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3 to 9.0), total cardiovascular mortality (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 4.6 to 8.6), and all-cause mortality (RR = 3.0; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.7). A major independent effect of diabetes persisted in multivariate analyses after simultaneous control for other known coronary risk factors (for these end points, RR [95% CI] = 3.1 [2.3 to 4.2], 3.0 [1.6 to 5.7], 3.0 [1.9 to 4.8], and 1.9 [1.4 to 2.4], respectively). The absolute excess coronary risk due to diabetes was greater in the presence of other risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. These prospective data indicate that maturity-onset clinical diabetes is a strong determinant of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality among middle-aged women. The adverse effect of diabetes is amplified in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, many of which are modifiable.\r"

Pilocarpine hydrochloride (5-mg capsules, three times daily) was given for 5 months and a placebo was randomly assigned for 1 month in a double-blind fashion. Objective measurements of major salivary gland output, subjective impressions of oral moisture, treatment-related side effects, and a number of physiologic measures were assessed monthly. Pilocarpine significantly increased salivary output in 21 of the 31 patients. Subjective improvement in the feeling of oral dryness, speaking, chewing, and swallowing were reported by 27 individuals. Side effects, while common, generally were mild and tolerable. There were no significant alterations in cardiovascular or other physiologic measures. We conclude that pilocarpine is an effective and safe treatment for salivary gland hypofunction and xerostomia in selected patients. The increase in major gland output provides beneficial natural secretions and relief of oral dryness.\r"

We have found that while the majority of physicians believe strongly that HIV prevention is important and that physicians should play a prominent role in education, the incorporation of such measures in their practice lags far behind other areas of health prevention. Positive educational behavior was correlated with direct experience with HIV-infected patients and postgraduate education on HIV infection.\r"

Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover study comparing low doses of n-3 fatty acid supplementation with n-6 fatty acids on blood pressure in 33 subjects with mild hypertension. After a 6-week stabilization period, subjects ingested either 2.04 g/d of n-3 fatty acids or safflower oil (4.8 g/d of linoleic acid) for 12 weeks, then crossed over to the alternative encapsulated oil for another 12 weeks, after a 4-week washout period. All antihypertensive drug therapy had been discontinued. For the combined data, there were significant reductions from pretreatment values for supine diastolic (-2.4 mm Hg) and sitting systolic (-4.1 mm Hg) blood pressure after fish oil; no significant changes occurred after safflower oil control. Compared with safflower oil, fish oil supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean supine diastolic blood pressure of 3.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -7.3 and 0.1). Sitting diastolic and mean arterial pressures showed a sequence effect; therefore, only the initial period was used in an analysis of their responses. There were significant decreases from pretreatment values for sitting diastolic (-4.4 mm Hg), mean arterial (-5.1 mm Hg), and systolic (-6.5 mm Hg) blood pressure after fish oil. The differences between groups after the 12-week period remained statistically significant for sitting diastolic and sitting mean arterial blood pressures. No adverse changes were noted in plasma levels of lipid-related measures.\r"

Dietary lipids were assessed through a single 24-hour recall at the initiation of follow-up in 1966 to 1969. In the younger cohort, there were significant positive associations between the incidence of CHD and the proportion of dietary energy intake from total fat and monounsaturated fatty acids. The proportion of energy intake from saturated fatty acids had a marginally significant positive association with CHD. The associations remained even after adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, including serum cholesterol level, suggesting that their effects are at least partially independent of other established risk factors. In contrast to the younger cohort, none of the dietary lipids were associated with CHD in the older cohort. Dietary intervention for the prevention of CHD in younger men is supported by these findings.\r"

All patients had marked elevations of aminotransferases and sometimes remarkably high prothrombin times at, or shortly after, presentation. In five of six cases the diagnosis was missed by the physicians initially caring for the patient. The apparent reasons for the missed diagnosis were insufficient history regarding the use of acetaminophen, an inappropriate reliance on blood acetaminophen levels, and lack of knowledge regarding typical aminotransferase elevations in alcoholic hepatitis vs acetaminophen toxicity. The initial clinical presentation of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in chronic alcoholics is easily recognized clinically and is distinct from acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in suicide ingestions and from alcoholic hepatitis. Internists and other physicians should be aware of this entity and rely on the clinical picture and the history of acetaminophen use to confirm the diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Pneumocystis carinii is a frequent cause of interstitial pneumonitis in patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies. Extrapulmonary P carinii infection is a rare manifestation of disease caused by this organism. Nevertheless, reports of extrapulmonary P carinii infection are increasing in the setting of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). We report two cases of extrapulmonary P carinii infection in patients with AIDS and review the literature on this subject. We identified 37 such cases: in 19 cases, P carinii pneumonia was present concurrently; in 18 cases, involvement was exclusively extrapulmonary. A minority of patients were receiving aerosolized pentamidine isethionate therapy. Most patients had a history of P carinii pneumonia, and other AIDS-related illnesses, such as cytomegalovirus infection, mycobacterial disease, candidiasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and cryptococcosis were common. Concurrent cytomegalovirus infection indicated a poor prognosis, while otic pneumocytosis was associated with a favorable outcome. Pathologic evidence suggested that extrapulmonary pneumocystosis occurred by hematogenous and lymphatic dissemination from the lungs in most cases. In other cases, extrapulmonary pneumocystosis appeared to be due either to reactivation of latent infection in extrapulmonary sites or to primary infection of these sites. Further studies are needed to determine the true frequency of extrapulmonary involvement in P carinii infections and to define risk factors for acquisition of extrapulmonary pneumocytosis.\r"

The hemolysis and thrombocytopenia probably developed as a result of flow through the fibrin deposition in the plexiform lesions in the pulmonary circulation and subsequent shearing of red blood cells and platelets.\r"

The cumulative probability of a retinal detachment 1 year after the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus retinitis was 50%. Detachments were associated with increased size of the cytomegalovirus lesion and with lesions extending anteriorly up to the ora serrata. Treatment with an anticytomegalovirus drug appeared to delay the time to detachment. Median survival time after the diagnosis of retinal detachment was 9 months. In our study, vitrectomy with silicone oil as the initial surgical procedure was the most effective approach. Successful anatomic reattachment of the retina was achieved in 70% of patients undergoing this procedure. Despite the success of surgery, the visual outcome was disappointing, with only 20% of eyes achieving a final visual acuity of 5/200 or better.\r"

The final visual acuities were 20/25 or better in 48 eyes (90.6%), 20/30 to 20/100 in four eyes (7.5%), and 20/200 in one eye (1.9%). Although the final visual acuity was good, 33 eyes (62.3%) were symptomatic with blurred vision, metamorphopsia, or scotomas. Thirty-six eyes (67.9%) had significant central visual field defects on follow-up examination. There were no recurrences after the initial month of symptoms. The chorioretinal scars did not enlarge with time. Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy has a good longterm prognosis for visual acuity, although most patients have residual symptoms and paracentral scotomas.\r"

Apraclonidine caused a 30% reduction of mean (+/- SD) aqueous flow during the daytime from 2.84 +/- 0.61 microL/min, similar to what has been observed for beta-adrenergic antagonists. Apraclonidine, like acetazolamide and unlike timolol maleate, was able to suppress the aqueous flow of sleeping subjects below the spontaneous nocturnal rate of 1.15 +/- 0.40 microL/min to 0.84 +/- 0.28 microL/min, a 27% change. When apraclonidine and timolol were given together in the daytime, no clinically significant or statistically significant additive effect was observed. The range of flows with either drug alone or the combination of the two measured from 2 to 4 PM was 1.41 to 1.78 microL/min. This result contrasts with studies of the effect of apraclonidine on patients who have received long-term beta-blockers where an additive effect is observed. The lack of an additive effect on flow in previously untreated normal subjects suggests that the two drugs act at least in part via a common pathway.\r"

Eighteen normal volunteers participated in this six-armed, randomized, double-masked, crossover study. All subjects received the first study medication, either bilateral 0.3% flurbiprofen or placebo (its vehicle), every 30 minutes for four applications. They next received the second study medication: either 0.5% timolol maleate (Timoptic), 1% apraclonidine hydrochloride, or placebo in both eyes. We measured IOP before the instillation of the first study medication and the second study medication (baseline), and then at 1, 3, and 6 hours later. All subjects underwent all six treatment arms. Flurbiprofen alone had no effect on IOP. Maximum IOP lowering occurred between 3 and 6 hours after timolol and apraclonidine administration. There was no difference in IOP lowering between timolol- and apraclonidine-treated eyes. Pretreatment with flurbiprofen did not affect the IOP lowering that was obtained with timolol or apraclonidine administration.\r"

  ".W": "Flurbiprofen's effect on the ability of apraclonidine hydrochloride (para-aminoclonidine) to reduce aqueous humor flow was studied in 20 healthy human volunteers. Flurbiprofen sodium, in a 0.03% concentration, was administered topically to one eye and a placebo to the contralateral eye of each subject in a random, double-masked fashion. A total of four drops was administered to each eye during a 30-minute period beginning at 7 AM. Thirty minutes later, one drop of 1% apraclonidine was instilled into each eye. Flow rates were measured with fluorophotometry from 7 AM to noon. The mean (+/- SD) rate of flow after administration of flurbiprofen and apraclonidine at the peak of apraclonidine's effect was 1.56 +/- 0.50 microL/min, and after administration of placebo and apraclonidine was 1.53 +/- 0.43 microL/min. With a sample size of 20 and a coefficient of variation of flow measurement of 15%, there is a 95% chance of detecting a difference in flow rate of 15% or greater using the techniques employed in this study. Since there was no statistically significant difference between the rates of flow under the two conditions, we conclude that flurbiprofen has no appreciable effect on apraclonidine's ability to suppress aqueous flow.\r"

The longest FAZ diameters of 38 patients (51 eyes) with sickle cell disease were compared with those of the 48 patients (60 eyes) in the control group. The average of the longest FAZ diameter in the patients with sickle cell disease was 1.00 mm compared with 0.61 mm for the controls. This difference was statistically significant (P less than .00001). Within the sickle cell group, there were no significant differences in the FAZ diameters with respect to degree of retinopathy, type of sickle hemoglobinopathy, or visual acuity. Thus, an enlarged FAZ diameter in patients with sickle cell disease is confirmed.\r"

Intraocular pressure was measured at baseline, immediately after contact lens removal or displacement, and 5 minutes thereafter. The method of lens removal was either sliding displacement (51 eyes) or plucking (51 eyes). Right eyes were used for the test, and left eyes served as controls. Compared with baseline measurements, mean intraocular pressure immediately after plucking the lens was 0.8 mm Hg lower (P less than .01) and after sliding the lens was 0.5 mm Hg higher (P less than .05). Intraocular pressure changes of 4.0 mm Hg or more occurred in eight (15.6%) of 51 eyes in the pluck group vs four (7.8%) of 51 control eyes and in two (3.9%) of 51 eyes in the slide group vs zero of 51 control eyes. Compared with baseline, significant differences (P less than .05) were not found 5 minutes later. Clinicians who wish to minimize the influence of contact lens removal on tonometry readings should wait several minutes after contact lens removal before measuring intraocular pressure.\r"

Corneas that had radial keratotomy exhibited a polygonal pattern not seen in normal eyes; this occurred in 59% of corneas. All normal corneas demonstrated a cross-sectional shape configuration that was steeper centrally than peripherally; 79% of corneas after radial keratotomy had a shape that was flatter centrally than peripherally. After radial keratotomy, the dioptric power increased from the center to the periphery (radius of approximately 4.6 mm) by 2.8 +/- 2.2 diopters (mean +/- SD), with a sharp inflection zone (\"paracentral knee\") 2.7 mm from the center; normal corneas showed a smooth decrease in power from the center to the periphery of 1.9 +/- 0.5 diopters.\r"

We report the clinical and histopathologic findings in two cases of bilateral xanthelasmas and bilateral orbital infiltrates in association with Erdheim-Chester disease. The first patient was a 38-year-old man with cardiovascular and renal disease and severe retroperitoneal fibrosis. The massive orbital infiltration produced bilateral blindness. The second patient was a 77-year-old man with severe cardiovascular disease and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The diagnosis was confirmed in both patients with retroperitoneal and orbital biopsies. Both patients had the unusual occurrence of bilateral xanthelasmas with bilateral, diffuse orbital masses, eye findings that should alert the clinician to the possibility of this serious systemic disease.\r"

Therapeutic keratectomy was then performed on 28 eyes at a fluence of 180 mJ/cm2, a repetition rate of 10 Hz, and 500 pulses per eye. Solutions of 0.3% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose 2910 and a 0.1% dextran 70 solution, 1% carboxymethylcellulose sodium solution, or 0.9% saline solution were applied to the corneal surface of 21 eyes. Seven control eyes underwent ablation without the addition of fluid. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that corneas treated with dextran 70 had the least surface irregularity, and those treated with carboxymethylcellulose or saline solution had intermediate surface irregularity. Corneas that were ablated without additional fluid had the greatest surface irregularity. The application of a moderately viscous solution during therapeutic excimer laser keratectomy enhances the smoothing effect of surface ablation.\r"

One eye of each pair was then assigned randomly to antibiotic rinse/storage and the other eye to 3-minute immersion in 1% povidone-iodine. Both antimicrobial treatments decreased the numbers of positive cultures, with povidone-iodine showing an advantage that did not reach significance. These results demonstrate that saline irrigation of donor eyes in situ does not reduce surface contamination and that povidone-iodine immersion should be considered as an alternative for donor eye decontamination.\r"

Excision of all rectus muscles caused a generalized corneal flattening (-1.42 +/- 0.13 D; P less than .001). A computerized, finite element model of the globe, including the rectus muscles, demonstrated corneal deformation as a result of extraocular muscle tension; recession of an extraocular muscle in this model caused corneal flattening in the quadrant of the recessed muscle. These data suggest that corneal topography is affected by extraocular muscle tension, corroborating clinical reports of refractive change after strabismus surgery.\r"

Maximum accommodative response to corneal (iontophoretic) carbachol hydrochloride, baseline outflow facility, and the facility response to strong but submaximal intracameral doses of pilocarpine hydrochloride all declined with age. The correlation between accommodative response to carbachol and facility response to pilocarpine was slightly stronger than that between age and facility response. Since the ciliary muscle plays a major role in controlling both outflow facility and accommodation, and since histologic and videographic techniques demonstrate an age-related decline in rhesus ciliary muscle excursion induced by topical pilocarpine or electrical stimulation of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, the present data support the hypothesis that an age-related decline in ciliary muscle mobility is associated, perhaps causally, with an age-related decline in facility and facility responsiveness to cholinergic drugs.\r"

Ptc,O2 was also used to assess two methods of ulcer prophylaxis. Measurements were made over the gaiter skin, the healed ulcer and the upper arm. The results were expressed as a ratio of the lower limb readings over those taken from the arm. Patients were randomized, after the ulcer had healed, to elastic stockings and stanozolol, or elastic stockings and surgical ligation of incompetent superficial veins. Patients who declined to participate in the study were prescribed elastic stockings only. Those limbs remaining healed at 12 months had Ptc,O2 ratios remeasured. The Ptc,O2 ratios from limbs that reulcerated were not significantly lower than those from limbs remaining healed. The Ptc,O2 ratio was significantly increased in limbs treated by stanozolol and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05) and by surgery and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in Ptc,O2 in limbs treated by elastic stockings alone. In those treated by surgery and elastic stockings, there was a significant improvement in limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01), but not in limbs with post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. Although these two methods of ulcer prophylaxis improve the Ptc,O2 ratio, a high ratio has not been shown to be beneficial in preventing ulcer recurrence.\r"

One hundred eight medical students obtained 182 blood specimens from each other by means of standard methods. Each specimen was inoculated into two culture bottles. The first bottle was inoculated with the needle used for phlebotomy, and the second was inoculated after needle change. Four (2.2%) of 182 bottles were contaminated when the needle was not changed, compared with one (0.6%) when the needle was changed. This small difference was not statistically significant, and the likelihood of having failed to detect a 5% difference in contamination rate was small.

Like most diagnostic tools, radiographs can provide valuable information, but they also have the potential to be abused. One of the first tasks in ensuring optimal use of any procedure is to establish criteria for proper patient selection. This article is a review of general and specific indications for office radiographs on both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients based on published expert consensus and studies that have examined indications for radiographs using clinical criteria. For symptomatic patients, indications are discussed for the following radiographs: extremities (traumatic and nontraumatic), skull, abdomen, chest, orbits, sinuses, facial bones, and spine. Indications for asymptomatic patients are discussed with specific attention to lumbosacral spine and chest radiographs. When appropriate indications are followed, the physician can avoid the problem of overuse and its consequent radiation and economic burdens, as well as the problem of underuse with its risk of incomplete evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the accuracy of the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer two studies were done with subjects with a wide range of blood pressure. When readings made by one observer on the UK model of the Hawksley sphygmomanometer were compared with readings by two independent observers on separate mercury sphygmomanometers, the Hawksley device underestimated systolic readings by a mean (SD) of 2.0 (2.4) and 0.5 (3.6) mm Hg and diastolic readings by a mean of 3.7 (2.7) and 2.8 (2.9) mm Hg. When readings made on the UK and US models of the Hawksley sphygmomanometer were compared with those made on mercury sphygmomanometers, with observers exchanging devices half way during the experiment, the UK Hawksley device underestimated systolic pressure by a mean of 3.8 (SD 3.5) mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure by 7.5 (3.8) mm Hg; and the US model by 2.6 (3.4) mm Hg for systolic pressure and 6.2 (3.7) mm Hg for diastolic pressure. There was better agreement between two observers using standard sphygmomanometers than between an observer using the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer and an observer using a standard sphygmomanometer. Thus, the quantitative aspects of blood pressure in epidemiological and intervention studies in which the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer was used need re-evaluation. Moreover, the Hawksley random zero sphygmomanometer, in its present design, should not be used in hypertension research.\r"

Mean (+/- SEM) blood pressure fell to the same degree following treatment with either nifedipine (147 +/- 3/98 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) or atenolol (149 +/- 3/99 +/- 2 to 135 +/- 2/86 +/- 3 mm Hg). Circulating plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, before and after breakfast (8:00 AM), and at lunch time (noon). The response to treatment was different in the two groups. Specifically, plasma glucose concentration were unchanged and insulin concentrations were higher in association with atenolol treatment. In contrast, nifedipine-treated patients had similar plasma insulin, but lower plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations after four months of therapy. The changes in day-long plasma glucose and insulin responses suggested that resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake had increased in association with atenolol treatment and decreased following nifedipine. This conclusion was supported in that measurement of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal showed a decrease in atenolol-treated patients and an increase in nifedipine-treated patients. Finally, plasma lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not change following atenolol therapy, whereas plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in association with nifedipine administration. These data show that changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism observed with treatment of mild hypertension can vary significantly as a function of the drug used, despite similar beneficial effects on blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to define the angiotensin II receptor subtype responsible for prostaglandin release, we studied the effects of the nonpeptide, subtype 1 (or B) selective angiotensin II antagonist, DuP 753. Release of prostaglandin E2 produced by angiotensin II from rat C6 glioma, human astrocytoma, or porcine aortic smooth muscle cells in culture was blocked by the addition of the 10(-7) M of DuP 753. In contrast, the release of prostacyclin, as assessed by measurement of the stable metabolite 6-keto PGF1 alpha, was not attenuated by addition of Du P 753. However, DuP 753 either alone or in combination with angiotensin II, produced dose-dependent increases in prostacyclin release with doses as low as 10(-8) M. In the absence of angiotensin II, DuP 753 also increased prostaglandin E2 release at high doses but the magnitude of the potentiation was substantially less than for prostacyclin release (50 to 250% v 400 to 2800% above basal). Thus, we clearly show that angiotensin II stimulates PGE2 release via subtype 1 (or B) angiotensin receptors. Whether the effect of DuP 753 on prostaglandin release is a result of agonistic properties or intrinsic effects unrelated to blockage of angiotensin II receptors remains to be determined. The marked stimulatory effect of DuP 753 release precludes characterization of the receptor subtype that mediates the Ang II-induced release of prostacyclin. Nonetheless, potent stimulation of prostacyclin release by DuP 753, especially in vascular smooth muscle cells, requires reevaluation of the mechanisms that participate in the anti-hypertensive effects of the compound.\r"

  ".W": "Blood pressure and heart period variability have been measured directly in 142 subjects with mild hypertension over 24 h. The variabilities have been expressed as the standard deviation of 2 min averages of all beats over 24 h. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed in 102 subjects by the phenylephrine method. Blood pressure varies over a range of approximately 40% around the mean by day and by approximately 20% at night. The variability of blood pressure by day was inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the baroreflex (r = -0.33, P less than .001), while the variability of heart period was directly related to the sensitivity of the reflex (r = 0.27, P less than .01). Neither of these relationships was significant at night. An inverse relationship between heart period and blood pressure was shown by regression analysis of blood pressure and heart period averages over 24 h. The steepness of the slope of the heart period-systolic blood pressure relationship was strongly correlated with the baroreflex sensitivity (r = -0.55, P less than .001), suggesting that blood pressure variations are substantially buffered by changes in heart frequency. Thus, a more stable heart rate that results from an ineffective baroreflex is associated with a more variable systolic blood pressure.\r"

Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR) were recorded during two tasks, a mental arithmetic task involving serial subtraction and the cold pressor test. Significant cardiovascular responsivity was observed during both tasks as measured by substantial elevations in SBP, DBP, and HR from resting periods to task periods. Heritability estimates were statistically significant for SBP and DBP but not HR levels during pretask baseline periods and during both tasks. Genetic variance was maintained for blood pressure reactivity to the mental arithmetic task after adjustments for baseline and performance. No genetic variance for SBP or DBP reactivity to the cold pressor test was evident.\r"

In the hypertensive subjects compared to the normotensive subjects mean arterial pressure was 25% higher (P less than .001), systemic vascular resistance 23% higher (P less than .01), proximal compliance 19% lower (P less than .01), and distal compliance 72% lower (P less than .001). The reduction in distal compliance was highly age-dependent. In the youngest age range (45 to 54 years) little overlap appeared between hypertensive and normotensive groups, whereas in the oldest subjects studied (65 to 75 years) distal compliance was comparably low in the two groups. Thus, distal vascular compliance provides a sensitive and specific marker for the abnormal vasculature associated with hypertension and may be particularly useful in identifying the disease in young individuals with borderline blood pressure.\r"

Recent in vitro studies suggest that theophylline might act as an antagonist of adenosine. This hypothesis was tested in hypertensives by assessing the effect of theophylline on adenosine mediated vasodilation. Drugs were infused into the brachial artery while forearm blood flow (venous plethysmography) was continuously monitored. Adenosine, infused cumulatively (5, 15, and 50 micrograms/min for 3 min each; n = 5), caused a dose-dependent vasodilation that was clearly blunted in the presence of theophylline in a dose not affecting basal arterial flow (1000 micrograms/min for 20 min). On the contrary, papaverine, a selective phosphodiesterase activity inhibitor, infused at two increasing doses (100 and 300 micrograms/min for 20 min, n = 5), did not affect adenosine mediated vasodilation. Our data show that theophylline acts as a specific antagonist of adenosine in humans, an effect which might be relevant for its pharmacological action.\r"

All these effects were abolished by the simultaneous intrarenal infusion of a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (LNMMA). Furthermore, the intrarenal infusion of this inhibitor alone also produced a significant decrease in basal renal blood flow. The administration of L-arginine, a precursor of nitric oxide, prevented the inhibitory effect of LNMMA on the renal vasodilatory and excretory response to BK. Glomerular filtration rate and mean arterial pressure did not change throughout the experiment. It is concluded that the renal vasodilatory and excretory responses to intrarenal BK in meclofenamate-treated dogs are largely dependent on endothelium-derived nitric oxide.\r"

In WKY, blood pressure (BP) and extracellular NE content 24 h after SAD were significantly higher than those of sham-operated rats.

Low density lipoprotein cholesterol (15 micrograms/mL) induced an elevation of intracellular Ca2+ from 85 to approximately 210 nmol/L in vascular smooth muscle cells from rat aorta in the absence or in the presence of 15 micrograms/mL monoclonal antibodies against the classical low density lipoprotein receptor or in the presence of apolipoprotein B-100. Moreover, in both human cultured fibroblasts from normocholesterolemic individuals and from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia homozygote class 1, LDL induced a dose-dependent rise of free intracellular calcium and a biphasic change of intracellular pH. Since homozygote class 1 fibroblasts are classical LDL receptor negative, and as antibodies against this receptor, as well as apolipoprotein B-100, did not attenuate the LDL-induced elevation of cytosolic calcium, we conclude that LDL might modify vascular activity via the observed intracellular changes without involving the classical low density lipoprotein receptor.\r"

Hypertension tends to occur in association with other risk factors which augment the risk and need to be considered in evaluating the hazard of hypertension, the urgency for treatment, and the choice of treatment. Elevated blood pressure is often accompanied by blood lipid abnormality, obesity, electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormality, glucose intolerance, and elevated fibrinogen and hematocrit, all of which enhance the risk of cardiovascular sequelae of hypertension. Hypertensive patients at particularly increased risk of cardiovascular events are those with an increased total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, ECG abnormality, impaired glucose tolerance, or the cigarette smoking habit. The risk of a cardiovascular event among hypertensive patients varies over more than a 10-fold range depending on the number of these coexistent risk factors. Multivariate risk formulations are available to allow a composite estimate of the joint conditional probability of a cardiovascular outcome in hypertensive patients with multiple risk factors. Since some antihypertensive agents can adversely affect blood lipids, glucose tolerance, or uric acid values, the risk profile must also be taken into account in choosing the optimal antihypertensive therapy. Also, hypertension is commonly associated with angina, myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke, or cardiac failure. These too must be taken under consideration in judging the urgency for treatment and the choice of agents. Thus, hypertension is best regarded as a component of a cardiovascular risk profile in implementing optimal therapy and in assessing its efficacy.\r"

Treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in young SHR reverses the renovascular abnormalities more effectively than simple vasodilators, suggesting that the resistance changes may depend on angiotensin II. Perindopril treatment during the development of hypertension causes a reduction in blood pressure as a result of a fall in total peripheral resistance, which persists long after treatment is stopped. These long-term effects can be prevented by replacing angiotensin during perindopril treatment. Not all organs share the long-term resistance changes following perindopril treatment, which are most marked in the renal, splanchnic, and cerebral circulations. The heterogeneous patterns of regional vascular resistance during the development and after prevention of hypertension with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in SHR suggest that local factors, for example, angiotensin II related to the tissue renin-angiotensin system or local adrenergic activity, may be important in the genesis of high blood pressure in this genetic model.\r"

Following oral perindopril, plasma perindoprilic acid and the pattern of inhibition of plasma ACE activity were maximal at 1 to 2 h, but recovered over 24 h. However, inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin I was more prolonged, being 95% at 4 h, but had not fully recovered by 24 h. Acutely, ACE was markedly inhibited in renal proximal tubules, lung parenchyma, and aortic wall. At 24 h, ACE in these tissues had only partially recovered. Angiotensin converting enzyme in vascular endothelium of other organs showed a similar pattern of inhibition. In contrast, ACE in testicular seminiferous tubules was unaffected by perindopril. After chronic (14 days) administration of perindopril, total plasma ACE increased 3-fold, of which 49% was occupied by the inhibitor. Total tissue ACE in kidney and aorta did not change, and the pattern of inhibition observed acutely was maintained during chronic treatment. These results demonstrate a prolonged effect of ACE inhibitors on tissue ACE that may better explain the time course of these drugs than the changes in plasma ACE or plasma levels of the drugs.\r"

However, when given to rings of canine basilar and coronary arteries, increasing concentrations of perindoprilat potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxation to bradykinin. In addition, the drug potentiated the endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine and thrombin in preparations of canine left anterior descending coronary arteries. In contrast, perindoprilat did not cause changes in tension when given in the presence of either adenosine diphosphate, serotonin, or arginine-vasopressin. The compound did not modify the endothelium-dependent contractions evoked by the calcium ionophore A23187 and acetylcholine in canine basilar arteries. It also did not alter endothelium-dependent contractions to arachidonic acid or to hypoxia in canine pulmonary veins or to acetylcholine in the aorta of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, systemic and coronary hemodynamics, and mechanical cardiac performance in renovascular hypertensive rats (Goldblatt, two-kidneys, one-clip). Systemic and coronary hemodynamics, before and after carbochrome infusion, were assessed by radioactive microspheres injection via an atrial catheter in conscious rats. Mechanical performance was measured on isolated papillary muscle from the same animal. Twelve treated hypertensive rats were compared with 10 nontreated hypertensive rats and nine sham-operated normotensive rats of the same age. Perindopril treatment induced a complete control of blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 156 +/- 22 mm Hg in the untreated group to 100 +/- 24 mm Hg in the treated group (P less than .01), compared to 106 +/- 18 mm Hg in the sham group). This was associated with a nearly complete regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass/body weight 2.26 +/- 0.38 mg/g in the treated group v 3.1 +/- 0.6 in the untreated group [P less than .01], compared to 2 +/- 0.25 mg/g in the sham group [p = NS]). Minimal left ventricular coronary resistances after carbochrome were slightly higher in the hypertensive group compared both to sham and treated group. A reversal of impaired myocardial mechanical parameters towards control values was observed, except for some parameters of relaxation. We conclude that perindopril allows in this model a complete control of blood pressure, and a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with normalization of coronary hemodynamics and contractile function.\r"

In both strains, a significant blood pressure reduction was observed. In normotensive rats, the hemodynamic changes involved significant increase in systemic arterial compliance whereas slight changes in left ventricular weight and aortic medial thickness were observed. In hypertensive rats, the increase in compliance was relatively small, whereas there was a major reduction in medial thickness. Furthermore, the reduction of the media thickness was much more pronounced than that of the left ventricular hypertrophy. The present results suggest that the cardiac and arterial changes observed following long term converting enzyme inhibition do not strictly parallel the blood pressure changes in hypertensive rats. Dissociation between cardiac and arterial changes may be observed.\r"

Blood pressure was measured via a chronically implanted arterial cannula and CBF by hydrogen clearance. Chronic renovascular hypertension, like spontaneous hypertension, caused a marked shift in the lower limit of CBF autoregulation but did not alter basal CBF. In SHR, acute administration of perindopril did not diminish CBF in spite of the fact that BP fell to a level below the lower limit of CBF autoregulation (determined by hypotensive hemorrhage). Chronic treatment of renovascular hypertensive rats with perindopril normalized BP and restored CBF autoregulation.\r"

Since hyperfiltration consecutive to the decreased number of nephrons may be damaging to the kidney, we investigated how fasting and CEI compare in lowering glomerular filtration rate in partially nephrectomized rats. Male Wistar rats were subjected to 3/4 nephrectomy and chronically catheterized. A week after surgery, the animals were separated into two groups, one control and one treated with the converting enzyme inhibitor perindopril (1 mg/kg/24 h) for ten days. In the control untreated 3/4 nephrectomized rats, successive measurements of kidney function in the same animal showed that renal blood flow and glomerular filtration were 30 to 50% higher in fed than in fasted animals. In the group treated with perindopril, there was no longer any such difference in the renal blood flow and filtration rate. These results indicate that, by blunting postprandial hyperfiltration, chronic converting enzyme inhibition is as effective as food restriction in reducing the load delivered to the kidney.\r"

  ".W": "The systemic and regional hemodynamic effects of angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been investigated using different experimental methods (pulsed Doppler, radioactive microspheres), either in rats (normotensive NT or genetically hypertensive SHRs) or in humans (healthy volunteers or patients with congestive heart failure CHF). All ACEIs decreased systemic vascular resistance but the profile of their peripheral vasodilating properties was heterogeneous. ACEI-induced vasodilation primarily affected the kidney in rats and in humans and this effect was accompanied by a strong and consistent increase in renal blood flow. This occurred even at non-hypotensive doses in SHRs and CHF patients and resulted in a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the kidney. In the muscular vascular bed, ACEIs also decreased local vascular resistance in rats and in humans, whether normotensive or hypertensive. In humans, this vasodilation affected both the arterioles and the large conductance vessels, more markedly in CHF patients than in normotensive subjects. Muscular blood flow was increased and a favorable redistribution of cardiac output towards the muscle occurred. Cerebral blood flow in SHRs and carotid blood flow in humans were augmented, whereas hepatosplanchnic blood flow was increased in rats but not modified in humans. There was no major difference between the regional vasodilating profiles of the different ACEIs, but captopril was somewhat less active at the muscular level. In conclusion, ACEI-induced regional vasodilation is heterogeneous, preferentially affecting the kidney and the muscle. In the latter, both arterioles and large conductance vessels are dilated.\r"

  ".U": "91254658\r", 
  ".W": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has long been regarded as a classical hormonal system, with angiotensin II (ANG II) being the circulating effector peptide. In recent years, evidence for additional RAS in various organs, including vascular wall, kidney, adrenal gland, heart, and brain, has been obtained. Drugs interfering with the RAS such as the converting enzyme (CE) inhibitors may, therefore, not only inhibit the plasma RAS but also inhibit these tissue RAS. Such a \"tissue\" RAS inhibition has been repeatedly demonstrated in animal experiments, and in some cases it correlated better with the cardiovascular actions of the CE inhibitors than did inhibition of plasma RAS. In the vascular wall, a local inhibition of ANG II synthesis may contribute not only to the reduction of vascular tone but also to the marked regression of media hypertrophy seen after CE inhibitor treatment. Vascular ANG II generation by CE appears to occur almost exclusively at the luminal surface of the endothelium. Locally formed ANG II may then contribute to the pool of circulating ANG II (endocrine ANG II) or feed back to adjacent cells without being transported by the blood (paracrine ANG II). Thus, CE inhibitors may not have to penetrate into deeper layers of the vascular wall to inhibit the vascular RAS, but may rather prevent the paracrine actions of locally generated ANG II.\r"

Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed three factors predicting inflammatory trachoma in children: the absence of a latrine in the household, school-age siblings with inflammatory trachoma, and additional same-age siblings (with or without disease) in the household. In the Egyptian setting the presence of pit latrines in all houses, even when full and unscreened, might result in a reduction in trachoma prevalence in this population from the current 49% to 35%. The construction of pit latrines may offer the simplest and most acceptable environmental method for reducing trachoma in this trachoma endemic area.\r"

Five such patients were treated with a combination of steroids and low-dose cyclosporin therapy, and in all cases the scleritis remained under control on a much lower dose of steroids than when steroids were used alone. Cyclosporin is therefore a useful drug in the management of younger patients dependent on high-dose steroids to control their scleral inflammation.\r"

Computer analysis of this scattered light can distinguish cells (expressed as cell count) from protein (expressed as photon count/ms), and in-vitro work with albumin solutions has shown that the photon count/ms is linearly related to protein concentration. This study of 106 normal eyes (53 subjects) assesses the accuracy and sensitivity of the instrument and the factors affecting the interpretation of its results. Using in-vitro solutions of human albumin we found a highly significant linear correlation (r = 1, p = 0.0001) between photon count and protein concentration. The results show that the instrument has a photon count/ms reproducibility of 8.26% and that there is a within-subject variability in photon count/ms (aqueous flare) of 12.2% in normal eyes. No significant difference in photon count/ms (aqueous flare) was found to exist between right and left eyes (p greater than 0.4), between sexes (p greater than 0.5), or between irides of different colour (p greater than 0.8). There was also no statistically significant variation in photon counts/ms with time of day over the period of measurement (1000-1900 h) (p = 0.4). There was, however, an increase in photon count/ms with age (r = 0.57, p less than 0.001) and a decrease with pupillary dilatation at both 30 and 60 minutes after instillation of tropicamide 1% (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seventy-four cases of retinal disease and 202 control patients were studied. Patients with retinal disease had a significantly higher incidence of toxoplasma seropositivity than the control group. This was because some patients with retinal disease had acquired the infection congenitally. Half the patients investigated for toxoplasmosis were seronegative. Possible explanations for these findings included misdiagnosis, clinical uncertainty, or, the use of serology testing in the confirmation of other diseases. An excess of IgM reactivity among the retinal disease group may indicate low level immunoglobulin-M production associated with an acute exacerbation of ocular toxoplasmosis. There is a need to consider invasive procedures in cases of ocular infection and for novel techniques to aid the diagnosis of toxoplasma retinochoroiditis.\r"

  ".W": "Two elderly women have each received a monofocal intraocular lens in one eye and a 3M diffractive bifocal intraocular lens in the other eye. Both eyes were shown to have equivalent retinal/neural function by measuring contrast sensitivity to laser interference fringes which bypassed refractive and other defects of the ocular media. The eyes with a bifocal intraocular lens displayed a much greater depth of focus, though at the expense of diminished contrast sensitivity compared with the normal values expected for that age. Simulation experiments suggested that the observed reduction in contrast sensitivity was not adequately explained by a simple reduction in retinal illumination of the in-focus image as might intuitively be expected from the bifocal separation of incident light to two simultaneous focal points. The simultaneous superimposition of the out-of-focus image on the in-focus image must also be considered, since this caused a significant reduction in contrast sensitivity when the retinal illumination was insufficiently above the photopic luminance threshold.\r"

Before firm attachment, leukocytes are observed rolling slowly along the endothelium in venules of most tissues accessible to intravital microscopy. The molecular mechanism underlying this early type of leukocyte-endothelial interaction is unknown. Leukocyte rolling was investigated in venules (diameter, 40 microns) of the exposed rat mesentery. Micro-infusion of a recombinant soluble chimera (LEC-IgG) of the murine homing receptor lectin-like cell adhesion molecule 1 (LEC-CAM 1; gp90MEL) into individual venules reduced the number of rolling leukocytes by 89% +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM, n = 20 venules), while a similar CD4 chimera (CD4-IgG) had no effect (inhibition 14% +/- 7%, n = 25). Rolling was also greatly reduced by a polyclonal serum against LEC-CAM 1 (inhibition 84% +/- 3%, n = 35); preimmune serum was ineffective (11% +/- 13% inhibition, n = 28). These findings indicate that LEC-CAM 1 mediates the adhesive interaction underlying leukocyte rolling and thus may play an important role in inflammation and in pathologic conditions involving leukocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Platelets contain proteins with biochemical properties that are well adapted to promoting hemostasis. One important adhesive protein is von Willebrand factor (vWF), which is a very large protein comprised of a series of multimers, ranging from 860,000 to over 10 million daltons. In this report we describe a second platelet protein, p-155, which has a similar unique multimeric composition. Using agarose-acrylamide gel electrophoresis, platelet p-155 was shown to be composed of multimers ranging from less than 450 Kd to many million daltons. Based on this unique structure, we propose that the native molecule be designated as multimerin. Comparison with vWF showed that multimerin contained less of the very high molecular weight multimers. Differential reduction demonstrated that the smallest multimer is a trimer, composed of three 155-Kd subunits. Platelet releasate was demonstrated to contain mainly the smaller multimers, suggesting that the larger multimers bind to the platelet surface. Other studies indicate that multimerin and vWF are the two largest platelet proteins and the only two platelet proteins exhibiting a complex, disulfide-linked multimeric composition with variability in multimer size.\r"

  ".W": "Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for advanced hematologic malignancies is associated with high relapse rates. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represent a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality that might prevent or delay relapses if used early after ABMT at a time when the tumor burden is minimal. However, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and ABMT might increase patients' susceptibility to IL-2 toxicity, and might interfere with immunologic responses to IL-2 in vivo. Therefore, to determine safety, tolerance, and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 therapy early after ABMT, IL-2 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 16 patients 14 to 91 days (median, 33) after ABMT for acute leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating IL-2 \"induction\" doses (0.3 to 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 1 to 5), and all patients received a nonescalating IL-2 \"maintenance\" dose (0.3 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 12 to 21). Most patients exhibited mild to moderate fever, nausea, diarrhea, and/or skin rash with IL-2 infusions. The maximum tolerated \"induction\" dose was 3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d; dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and thrombocytopenia. All toxicities reversed on stopping the IL-2 infusions, and all patients completed \"maintenance.\" Postinfusion lymphocytosis was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. With the higher IL-2 doses, increased percentages of patients' PBMC expressed CD16 and CD56, with augmented lysis of K562 and Daudi, reflecting the induction of natural killer and circulating LAK effector activities. Increased LAK precursor activity was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. Thus, the IL-2 therapy regimen was safely tolerated after ABMT, and pronounced immunomodulatory effects were observed with the higher IL-2 doses. These studies support the planned use of IL-2 and LAK cells after ABMT in an attempt to reduce relapses of advanced hematologic malignancies.\r"

We studied the biologic properties and the globin synthetic profiles of JCML erythroid cells both in vivo and in vitro from a total of 24 patients. In these cases we observed the exuberant colony-forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M) colony growth, as reported previously. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, we found significant erythroid colony growth in most of our cases (average: 1,182 burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFUe] per 10(5) plated cells, range: 40 to 6,927). This growth was by and large erythropoietin-dependent and was not greatly influenced by other added cytokines. By several criteria all erythroid colony growth detected in vitro was derived from JCML progenitors. The globin synthetic profile of JCML erythroid cells showed high levels of fetal hemoglobin both in vivo and in vitro (gamma/gamma + beta: 53% to 94% in reticulocytes, 62% to 98% in BFUe-derived cells). In addition (in seven cases studied) we detected embryonic globins (epsilon and zeta) at the protein and messenger RNA level, a novel finding for primary leukemic cells. We speculate that the transformed erythroid cells in JCML harbor a trans environment supporting expression of developmentally earlier genes (fetal, embryonic). However, in contrast to other acute or subacute leukemias, JCML erythroid cells also have the ability to reach full maturation to the red cell level, thus allowing detection of this primitive program in vivo.\r"

We characterized the native Epo receptor on erythroleukemia cell lines by ligand blotting. Solubilized cell membrane proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and probed with 125I-Epo. Specificity was demonstrated by inhibition of 125I-Epo binding by unlabeled excess Epo but not other peptide growth factors and by the cellular distribution of the Epo binding protein. A single membrane protein of 61 Kd +/- 4 Kd was sufficient to bind 125I Epo in both human (OCIM2, K562) and murine (GM979, Rauscher, DA-1) cell lines. This finding is consistent with the predicted size of the Epo receptor from the murine cDNA clone. However, chemical crosslinking of 125I-Epo to its receptor has identified two Epo binding proteins of 105 Kd and 85 Kd. This difference may occur because the receptor is size fractionated before Epo binding in the ligand blot, but after Epo binding in crosslinking studies. Ligand blotting demonstrates that the native Epo receptor is composed of a single 61-Kd Epo binding protein, and suggests the presence of additional proteins of 20 to 25 Kd that associate with the receptor after Epo binding.\r"

We examined EP receptor expression during normal human erythroid differentiation and maturation from the burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) to the reticulocyte level. In contrast to previous studies, we assessed EP receptor number and affinity in erythroid precursors immunologically purified from fresh bone marrow aspirates or fetal liver samples and in reticulocytes purified from peripheral blood. EP receptors were quantitated by equilibrium binding experiments with 125I EP. We found that purified primary erythroblasts from both adult and fetal sources exhibited a single high-affinity (kd 100 pmol/L) binding site for EP under our experimental conditions, and 135 or 250 receptors per cell, respectively. Reticulocytes were devoid of EP receptors. We compared these data to in vitro-derived BFU-E progeny at both early and late stages of maturation. Cultured BFU-E progeny also displayed a single class of receptors of slightly lower affinity (210 to 220 pmol/L). Preparations enriched in colony-forming units-erythroid (CFU-E) and proerythroblasts (day 9 BFU-E progeny) displayed approximately 1,100 receptors per cell, whereas populations containing mature erythroblasts (day 14 BFU-E progeny) exhibited approximately 300 receptors per cell. Furthermore, information from binding experiments was complemented by autoradiography in both enriched BFU-E preparations, cultured BFU-E progeny (days 9 and 14), and marrow mononuclear cells. These studies are consistent with a peak in EP receptor expression at the CFU-E/proerythroblast stage and a decrease with further maturation to undetectable levels at the reticulocyte stage. These data examining EP receptor characteristics on freshly isolated erythroid precursor cells complement previous data on EP receptor biology using culture-derived erythroblasts.\r"

Immature cells were subdivided based on the expression of antigens found on hematopoietic progenitors (CD34, HLA-DR, CD33, CD19, CD45, CD71, CD10, and CD7). CD34+ cells were present in the circulation in about one-tenth the concentration of BM (0.2% v 1.8%) and had a different spectrum of antigen expression. A higher proportion of PB-CD34+ cells expressed the CD33 myeloid antigen (84% v 43%) and expressed higher levels of the pan leukocyte antigen CD45 than BM-CD34+ cells. Only a small fraction of PB-CD34+ cells expressed CD71 (transferrin receptors) (17%) while 94% of BM-CD34+ expressed CD71+. The proportion of PB-CD34+ cells expressing the B-cell antigens CD19 (10%) and CD10 (3%) was not significantly different from BM-CD34+ cells (14% and 17%, respectively). Few CD34+ cells in BM (2.7%) or PB (7%) expressed the T-cell antigen CD7. CD34+ cells were found to be predominantly HLA-DR+, with a wide range of intensity. These studies show that CD34+ cells and their subsets can be identified in normal PB and that the relative frequency of these cells and their subpopulations differs in PB versus BM.\r"

We investigated the effects of G-CSF on myeloid progenitors and primitive stem cells in a mouse bone marrow transplantation (BMT) system. Lethally irradiated mice received BM cells from untreated or 5-fluorouracil-treated mice, and then were administered G-CSF or carrier buffer (control) for 5 days from immediately after BMT. A pre-CFU-S assay was performed by the repeated transplantation of BM cells from the first BMT recipients to other mice. By the method of polymerase chain reaction, most of the spleen colonies in the secondary recipients were confirmed to be derived from the first donors. G-CSF did not increase the peripheral white blood cell count significantly, but did increase the number of immature myeloid cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells in the BM. The number of erythroid cells in the BM was initially suppressed and then increased by G-CSF treatment. In addition, the pre-CFU-S assay showed an increase in pre-CFU-S cells due to G-CSF administration. The number of spleen colonies of first BMT recipients did not increase, but a higher percentage of them were committed to a certain lineage by G-CSF treatment. These findings suggest that G-CSF has important roles in the early stages of hematopoiesis.\r"

There was no difference in DNA synthesis between winter and summer. A significantly higher DNA synthesis was demonstrated for samples obtained from sternum as compared with the iliac crests, but the same circadian pattern was demonstrated for both localizations. By taking circadian stage-dependent variations in DNA synthesis into account it may be possible to reduce BM sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy, to increase the effect of hematopoietic growth factors as well as increase the fraction of proliferating cells with careful selection of time of day for harvesting BM cells for auto- or allografting.\r"

  ".W": "We compared the development of B-cell progenitors with that of myeloid progenitors in fetal liver cells at various gestational ages. Day 12 to 14 fetal liver cells did not form pre-B-cell colonies. Pre-B-cell colonies were developed from day 15 fetal liver cells. The incidence of colonies increased with increases in gestational age and reached a maximum on days 18 to 19. In contrast, the incidence of myeloid colonies formed in the presence of interleukin-3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin did not change significantly during days 13 to 21 of gestation. After coculturing day 13 fetal liver cells with IL-7-producing stromal cell line ST-2, they could respond to IL-7 and proliferate. Analysis of the phenotypes showed that day 13 fetal liver cells were B220-, IgM-, while culturing day 13 fetal liver cells with ST-2 and untreated day 18 fetal liver cells contained the population of B220+ cells. Even in the presence of IL-7-defective stromal cell line FLS-3, IL-7-responsive cells could be induced from day 13 fetal liver cells. IL-7 acted on B220+ cells and induced pre-B-cell colonies that contained IgM+ cells in the methylcellulose culture. IL-7 mRNA was expressed in days 13 and 18 fetal liver cells but not in pre-B cells or adult liver cells. From these findings, it is suggested that stromal cells or stromal-derived factors but not IL-7 were required for the differentiation from B220- cells to B220+ cells. In the second stage, B220+, IgM- cells proliferated and some of them differentiated to IgM+ cells in the presence of IL-7 alone. The two-step model can apply to in vivo early B lymphopoiesis.\r"

  ".U": "91255680\r", 
  ".W": "Erythropoietin (EPO) plays a critical role in stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells. EPO is heavily glycosylated with three asparagine (N)-linked tetraantennary oligosaccharides that may contain N-acetyl-lactosamine repeats and a single serine (O)-linked oligosaccharide. EPO expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells exhibits biologic properties and amino acid and carbohydrate composition similar to natural urinary EPO. The importance of the complex N-linked and the O-linked carbohydrate was studied by expressing EPO in cells that are deficient in UDP-galactose/UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine 4-epimerase activity. In these cells, the ability to add galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine to glycoproteins can be controlled by the addition of these sugars to the culture medium. The results demonstrate that a block in O-linked glycosylation and/or the ability to process N-linked carbohydrate to completion does not alter EPO secretion. EPO produced without O-linked carbohydrate exhibits normal in vitro and in vivo biologic activity and in vivo clearance. However, EPO produced with incompletely processed N-linked oligosaccharides exhibits normal in vitro activity but is at least 500-fold less effective in stimulating erythropoiesis in vivo. Studies on the survival of bioactive EPO remaining in the circulation demonstrated that EPO with incomplete N-linked oligosaccharides exhibits a sevenfold increased rate of clearance. However, this increased clearance may not fully account for the 500-fold loss of in vivo activity. These results suggest a potentially important unique requirement for appropriate complex N-linked oligosaccharides for the intrinsic biologic activity of EPO in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "During the course of structural gene analyses for protein C deficiency, we have confirmed that a T or G nucleotide variation is present at exon 6 of the protein C gene. This single-base substitution was located at the third nucleotide coding for Ser (TCT) at 99 residue, and neither produces an amino acid substitution nor creates a new restriction enzyme site. By using mutagenic primers that could introduce A instead of G at the third nucleotide 3' to the de novo polymorphic site, we have created the polymorphic Xba I site (T/CTAGA) in a more-frequent allele. Polymerase chain reaction using these mutagenic primers and subsequent Xba I digestion of 20 normal Japanese genomic samples showed that the frequency of this new sequence polymorphism designated as PC-493 was 0.18 and that the estimated heterozygosity rate was 28.9%. In Caucasians, the frequency of this polymorphism was 0.25, and a significant difference did not exist between Japanese and Caucasian populations. The examination of the haplotype inter-relationships with PC-493 and the Msp I polymorphism 5' to the protein C gene established that PC-493 gave a 16.7% chance of new information per individual for people who were previously homozygous for the Msp I polymorphism. We have performed a family study of the protein C-deficient pedigree using this sequence polymorphism, and found that the PC-493 DNA polymorphism was a useful marker for tracing the affected gene in protein C-deficient family members.\r"

  ".U": "91255683\r", 
  ".W": "Activation of human platelets considerably enhanced their ability to accelerate factor Va inactivation by activated protein C (APC). The anticoagulant activity of platelet suspensions was markedly dependent on the kind of agonist used to activate platelets. APC-catalyzed factor Va inactivation in free solution was characterized by an apparent second-order rate constant of 2 x 10(5) (mol/L)-1 (seconds)-1. Nonstimulated platelets (2.4 x 10(8)/mL) and platelets stimulated with adenosine diphosphate or adrenalin accelerated factor Va inactivation fourfold. Rates of factor Va inactivation were increased 11-fold by thrombin-stimulated platelets, 29-fold after platelet stimulation with the Ca(2+)-ionophore A23187. At low platelet concentrations (3 x 10(7)/mL) only background levels of anticoagulant activity were observed in platelet suspensions that were nonstimulated or stimulated with thrombin or collagen. However, when such reaction mixtures were stirred during the activation procedure, platelet anticoagulant activity was increased more than 10-fold. Independent of platelet stimulation and stirring conditions, exogenously added purified plasma protein S increased platelet-dependent factor Va inactivation approximately twofold. Addition of a neutralizing antiprotein S antibody had little effect on the anticoagulant activity of platelets. This indicates that, under the reaction conditions tested, platelet-released protein S did not contribute to factor Va inactivation. Approximately 25% of the anticoagulant activity of stimulated platelet suspensions appeared to be associated with microparticles that were released on platelet activation. Such microparticles may provide an important source of anticoagulant activity. A similar distribution of procoagulant, ie, prothrombinase, activity between platelets and microparticles was observed for the same platelet suspensions. Because platelet stimulation and stirring also had the same overall effects on the ability of platelets and platelet microparticles to promote prothrombin activation and factor Va inactivation, it appears likely that the generation of potential platelet anticoagulant and procoagulant activities is coupled to the same platelet stimulation reactions.\r"

  ".W": "Glycoprotein (GP) IIIb (also termed GPIV or CD36) is an integral platelet membrane protein, and has been identified as a binding site for thrombospondin, collagen, and malaria-infected erythrocytes. PAS-IV is an integral membrane protein found in lactating mammary epithelial cells and capillary endothelial cells. The N-terminal sequence of PAS-IV is nearly identical to that of GPIIIb and monospecific anti-PAS-IV antibody reacts with GPIIIb, indicating that PAS-IV is structurally related to GPIIIb. In this study, human platelet GPIIIb and bovine epithelial PAS-IV were compared in terms of structural, immunologic, and functional characteristics. The two-dimensional tryptic peptide map of both intact and deglycosylated PAS-IV was highly similar but not identical to that of GPIIIb. PAS-IV and GPIIIb reacted to an equal extent with monoclonal antibodies OKM5 and OKM8 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GPIIIb bound to surface immobilized thrombospondin (TSP) in a concentration-dependent and saturable manner, with approximately 60% reduction in binding in the presence of EDTA. PAS-IV bound to TSP with similar characteristics except that maximum binding was consistently approximately 50% of that of GPIIIb and binding was not inhibited by EDTA. GPIIIb supported adhesion of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (PRBC) in a dose-dependent manner while no significant adhesion of PRBC to PAS-IV was observed. Our data demonstrate that while epithelial PAS-IV and platelet GPIIIb are structurally and immunologically related, there are significant differences in their functional properties. Whether this result is due to different posttranslational glycosylation modifications or that PAS-IV and GPIIIb represent a family of related cell adhesive protein receptors remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Binding of anti-phospholipid antibodies to circulating platelets and its consequences on platelet activation and aggregation was investigated in 11 patients with anti-phospholipid antibodies. Seven patients had mild thrombocytopenia. Nine healthy donors served as controls. Binding to platelets was investigated by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with phospholipids as antigen on platelet eluates. Platelet activation was measured by flow cytofluorometry using monoclonal antibodies to an activation-specific lysosomal membrane protein. Findings in ELISA were compared with results of a conventional immunofluorescence method to detect platelet autoantibodies. In seven patients antibodies to negatively charged phospholipids were present in platelet eluates. In all thrombocytopenic patients and controls the platelets were not activated and aggregation was not impaired. There was a positive concordance of 50% between the results of immunofluorescence and ELISA. No apparent relation was found between the results of ELISA or immunofluorescence and platelet counts. It is concluded that anti-phospholipid antibodies can bind to circulating platelets. This binding is not associated with measurable aggregation abnormalities nor with platelet activation characterized by exposure of lysosomal membrane proteins. More studies are necessary to determine the exact role of anti-phospholipid antibodies in the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis.\r"

We have developed a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein (alpha 2M-Kal) complex using an F(ab')2 derivative of a monospecific polyclonal antibody against alpha 2 M as the capture antibody and a unique murine monoclonal antibody, 13G11, against the heavy chain of kallikrein as the detector antibody. The assay does not detect complexes in normal plasma but reacts with complexes generated by activating normal plasma with dextran sulfate at 4 degrees C in a range of 5 to 375 nmol/L. A close correlation of the ELISA with an amidolytic assay for alpha 2M-Kal was documented. Patients with sepsis syndrome but negative bacterial blood cultures did not show elevated plasma complexes, whereas a majority of those with positive blood cultures did show modest elevation and a single patient with septic shock showed a very high level of alpha 2M-Kal complex. Similarly, a patient with classic hereditary angioedema (HAE) showed increased concentration of complexes on three separate occasions during attacks but normal levels between attacks. Two other HAE patients did not show elevated levels at quiescent periods. The ELISA for alpha 2M-Kal appears to be sensitive, specific, and quantitative, and it can be used to reflect the degree of contact system activation in human sepsis and in HAE attacks.\r"

We have investigated the frequency with which drug-induced antibodies bind to GPIIb/IIIa and the nature of their target epitopes. In studies of sera from 13 patients sensitive to quinidine or quinine, we found that 10 contained IgG antibodies specific for both GPIb/IX and GPIIb/IIIa, two reacted with GPIb/IX alone, and one reacted with GPIIb/IIIa alone. In all cases, the presence of drug was required for binding of IgG to target GPs. By immunoabsorption, we found that each of five polyspecific sera contained at least two different antibodies, one reactive with GPb/IX and the other with GPIIb/IIIa. Further studies with eight drug-dependent antibodies (DDAb) specific for GPIIb/IIIa showed that three recognized the GPIIb/IIIa complex only, one recognized GPIIb alone, and three recognized GPIIIa alone. The eighth serum appeared to bind to both GPIIIa alone and to an epitope determined by the GPIIb/IIIa complex. The three antibodies specific for GPIIIa alone also reacted with GPIIIa deglycosylated with endo-H, and with the major (61 Kd) fragment obtained by chymotryptic digestion of GPIIIa but failed to react with reduced GPIIIa. These findings demonstrate that, in drug-induced, immunologic thrombocytopenia, the anti-platelet immune response is typically directed against epitopes on both GPIb/IX and GPIIb/IIIa. The three DDAb we studied that were specific for GPIIIa alone recognize epitopes resistant to chymotrypsin and endo-H treatment that are dependent on intrachain disulfide bonding.\r"

We recently isolated FcRIII cDNAs from NA1NA1 and NA2NA2 homozygotes and determined that they differ only at five nucleotides, predicting four amino acid substitutions. To determine whether the cDNAs that we isolated actually encode proteins that differ structurally and that react appropriately with anti-NA1 and anti-NA2 antibodies, we transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with constructs containing either the NA1 FcRIII cDNA or the NA2 FcRIII cDNA. The receptors on transfected CHO cells were then compared with the receptors on normal human neutrophils from an NA1NA2 heterozygote. After immunoprecipitation and treatment with N-glycanase, receptors isolated from surface-labeled CHO cells transfected with the NA1 FcRIII cDNA had an apparent molecular mass of 29 Kd after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), while the receptors isolated from CHO cells transfected with the NA2 FcRIII cDNA had an apparent molecular mass of 33 Kd. Identical 29-Kd and 33-Kd bands were observed when receptors isolated from surface-labeled neutrophils of an NA1NA2 heterozygote were treated similarly. Using a cell-free rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, we translated NA1 FcRIII and NA2 FcRIII RNAs in vitro and also found differences in the apparent molecular masses of the two forms of the receptor. Finally, reactivity of transfected CHO cells with anti-NA monoclonal and alloantibodies confirmed that the cDNAs we isolated actually encode the NA1 and NA2 forms of neutrophil FcRIII.\r"

Long-term cultures of stromal cells have been developed from the BM of nine patients with MM. These cells were mostly fibroblast-like elements, interspersed with a proportion of scattered macrophages and rare osteoclasts. BM stromal cells were CD54+, produced high levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and measurable amounts of IL-1 beta, and were used as feeder layers for autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). After 3 weeks of cocultures, monoclonal B lymphocytes and plasma cells, derived from PBMC, developed and the number of osteoclasts significantly increased. Both populations grew tightly adherent to the stromal cell layer and their expansion was matched by a sharp increase of IL-6 and by the appearance of IL-3 in the culture supernatant. These data attribute to BM stromal cells a critical role in supporting the growth of B lymphocytes, plasma cells, and osteoclasts and the in vivo dissemination of MM.\r"

These eosinophils show a chemotactic response toward PAF, LTB4, and C5a, but not to NAF/IL-8 and FMLP. Preincubation of the eosinophils with picomolar concentrations of GM-CSF caused a significant increase in the response toward LTB4 and induced a significant chemotactic response toward NAF/IL-8 and FMLP. Preincubation of the eosinophils with picomolar concentrations of IL-3 also induced a chemotactic response toward NAF/IL-8 and FMLP, and enhanced the PAF-induced chemotaxis response toward C5a was not influenced by both cytokines.

At these concentrations both GM-CSF and IL-3 acted as chemotaxins for eosinophils were washed after pretreatment with GM-CSF and IL-3 the potentiation of the chemotactic response remained, whereas the inhibitory mode of action disappeared. Our data indicate that at picomolar concentrations the cytokines GM-CSF and IL-3 can modulate eosinophil chemotaxis and at nanomolar concentrations these cytokines can act as chemotaxins for eosinophils.\r"

The effects of MC 540 on the lymphoid components in the marrow are unknown. This study evaluates the treatment of lymphocytes by MC 540 (15 micrograms/mL) and light (70 W/m2) on: (1) phytohemagglutinin and Con A-induced proliferation; (2) allogeneic mixed lymphocyte cultures (MLC); (3) the regulation of Ig synthesis by T cells; and (4) the ability of B cells to produce polyclonal Igs as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-plaque assay. The results show that MC 540 and light treatment reduced Con A-stimulated T-cell proliferation greater than 50% after 30 minutes and greater than 80% after 60 minutes of MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation. Ninety minutes of MC 540 and light exposure (designated treatment) inhibited MLC greater than 90%. In polyclonal Ig synthesis, T-cell helper activity could be abrogated by 90 minutes of treatment in cocultures containing untreated B cells. Purified B cells treated for 90 minutes cocultured with normal T cells did not produce Ig. Treatment of B cells completely inhibited Epstein-Barr virus-stimulated Ig synthesis. These data show that T- and B-cell immunity is suppressed by the MC 540-sensitized photoirradiation. Treatment of bone marrow with MC 540 and light may have profound effects on immune reconstitution in autologous marrow graft recipients. More provocative is the fact that the same immunomodulatory effects may be applicable to partially mismatched marrow transplant situations as a means of reducing graft-versus-host reactions.\r"

  ".U": "91255694\r", 
  ".W": "Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates both the proliferation and functional properties of normal and leukemic myeloid cells via cell surface receptors. The postreceptor mechanisms for these two actions, and the extent to which they represent overlapping biochemical pathways, have not been fully clarified. We have examined the actions of GM-CSF on the expression of c-myc, an early response oncogene associated with the proliferative stimulus of growth factors. GM-CSF reduced the population doubling time of HL-60 leukemia cells from 32 hours to 25 hours, and, at concentrations that were correlated with mitogenicity, induced a rapid twofold increase in the level of c-myc mRNA. Nuclear runoff studies indicated that GM-CSF approximately doubled the transcription rate of c-myc by reversing the transcription attenuation that occurs at the exon 1-intron 1 junction. GM-CSF had no effect on the half-life of c-myc messenger RNA. The biochemical basis for the modulation of c-myc expression by GM-CSF was explored. GM-CSF treatment caused intracellular alkalinization of the cells as measured using the fluorescent probe 2', 7-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The sodium channel blocker amiloride prevented the GM-CSF-induced change in pH, but did not affect the stimulation of c-myc transcription by GM-CSF. Agents that increase cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (prostaglandin E2 and cholera toxin) blocked the actions of GM-CSF on c-myc; however, these agents also reduced the basal level of c-myc expression. GM-CSF caused a rapid (5 minutes) and transient decline in cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, and a slower (30 minutes) and transient decrease in cellular cAMP levels. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the declines in cAMP and cGMP are associated with a stimulation of HL-60 proliferation, while previously reported manipulations that elevate cyclic nucleotides are related to an inhibition of HL-60 proliferation and the potentiation of differentiation.\r"

While neutrophils carry NE, they cannot produce it; the NE gene is expressed only in bone marrow granulocyte precursor cells. Protection of normal tissues from the destructive capacity of NE is provided by alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1 AT), a 52-Kd serine antiprotease produced by hepatocytes and mononuclear phagocytes. In the context of the broad destructive capacity of NE, we evaluated the concept that human neutrophils may be able to modulate the extracellular activity of NE by synthesizing and secreting alpha 1AT. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that the neutrophil contains alpha 1AT. Northern analysis and in situ hybridization with alpha 1AT-specific probes demonstrated the presence of alpha 1AT messenger RNA transcripts within neutrophils. [35S]methionine-labeling of neutrophils followed by immunoprecipitation of the supernatant with an anti-alpha 1AT antibody and sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel analysis demonstrated that neutrophils can synthesize alpha 1AT de novo and secrete the synthesized molecule. In the presence of major neutrophil degranulation, the antiprotease effect of neutrophil alpha 1AT is overwhelmed, allowing the NE to act unopposed in the extracellular microenvironment. However, in conditions where small amounts of NE are released by neutrophils, at least some of the secreted newly synthesized alpha 1AT was capable of complexing with NE. Thus, despite the fact that the neutrophil cannot synthesize NE, it can synthesize and secrete alpha 1AT, the inhibitor of NE, ie, the neutrophil is capable, to some extent, of modulating NE activity in the local milieu without the help of antiproteases produced by other cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and characterized a 2.4-kb cDNA clone encoding human neutrophil collagenase (HNC), a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases restricted to secondary granules within neutrophils. Partial amino acid sequence was used to deduce oligonucleotide probes. These probes were used to screen a human granulocyte cDNA library derived from messenger RNA (mRNA) from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia. Cell-free translation of RNA produced from the cDNA produced a 52-Kd protein that was recognized by anti-HNC antibody. The cDNA clone was sequenced and shown to encode a 467-residue protein whose sequence matched those regions currently known for HNC. The enzyme exhibits 58% homology to human fibroblast collagenase and has the same domain structure. It consists of a 20-residue signal peptide, and an 80-residue propeptide that is lost on autolytic activation by cleavage of an M-L bond. Other regions identified include the autolytic degradation site, the \"cysteine switch\" residue that is involved in latency and activation, and a putative zinc binding sequence. HNC has six potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The cDNA hybridized to a 3.4-kb mRNA in RNA from a patient with chronic granulocytic leukemia, but not to RNA from uninduced HL60 cells or HL60 cells that had been induced to undergo granulocytic or monocytic maturation with dimethyl sulfoxide or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, respectively. These results parallel those seen with lactoferrin and transcobalamin I, two other secondary granule proteins.\r"

  ".W": "The adhesion of monocytes to vascular surfaces is central to inflammation and atherogenesis; however, very little is known about regulatory factors that can prevent these processes. Here we report the inhibition of human monocyte adhesion to human endothelial layers and plastic by interleukin-4 (IL-4), a T-cell-derived glycoprotein with pleiotropic activities. The inhibitory effects of IL-4 were seen with basal and cytokine-stimulated monocyte adhesion, were apparent at low concentration, and were abolished by inactivating IL-4. No direct toxic effect of IL-4 on monocytes was detected. Inhibition of adhesion was accompanied by small increases in monocyte surface expression of the leukocyte-functional antigen group of adhesion structures, suggesting that absolute levels of expression may be less important than the functional status of such molecules in the regulation of monocyte adhesion. In addition, inhibition by IL-4 of cytokine-stimulated monocyte adhesion was not associated with changes in the surface expression of cytokine receptors. These results suggest a role for IL-4 in the regulation of monocyte adhesion, and may provide for a common mechanism for the inhibitory effects of IL-4 on monocyte function.\r"

  ".W": "Neutrophils exposed to fluoride ion (F-) respond with a delayed and sustained burst of superoxide anion release that is both preceded by and dependent on the influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium. The results of this study demonstrate a similarly delayed and sustained generation of 1,2-diglyceride in F(-)-treated neutrophils, over 90% of which was 1,2-diacylglycerol. Diacylglycerol generation was not dependent on the presence of extracellular Ca2+. Conversely, in contrast to results obtained with other agonists, removal of extracellular Ca2+ markedly potentiated synthesis of diacylglycerol in F(-)-treated neutrophils. This effect was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the recovery of phosphatidic acid. In either the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+, phosphatidic acid accumulated before diacylglycerol in F(-)-treated cells, suggesting the latter was derived from the former. Consistent with this hypothesis, the phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase inhibitor, propranolol, suppressed generation of diacylglycerol as it potentiated the accumulation of phosphatidic acid in F(-)-treated neutrophils. This effect was observed both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Moreover, high levels of propranolol (160 mumol/L) effected complete inhibition of diacylglycerol generation in F(-)-treated neutrophils with a corresponding increase in phosphatidic acid generation. Phosphatidylethanol accumulated in neutrophils stimulated with F- in the presence of ethanol. The extent of phosphatidylethanol accumulation at all time points after addition of F- corresponded to decreased levels of both phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, indicating that phosphatidylethanol was derived from the phospholipase D-catalysed transphosphatidylation reaction. The results indicate that F- activates a Ca(2+)-independent phospholipase D, which appears to be the major, if not sole, catalyst for both phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol generation in F(-)-treated neutrophils. Ca2+, mobilized as a result of F- stimulation and possibly as a consequence of phospholipase D activation, exerts a profound effect on cellular second messenger levels by modulating the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol.\r"

  ".W": "Subtle peroxidative perturbation of normal red blood cells (RBC) using t-butylhydroperoxide creates a leak pathway for monovalent cations that is reversibly activated by cell deformation. To determine what factor promotes expression of this unique membrane defect, we have dissected \"peroxidation\" into components that can be evaluated separately by comparing K leak from suitably modified RBC during elliptical deformation and parallel control incubation. Selective introduction of phospholipid hydroperoxides into normal RBC membranes successfully induces a deformation-dependent leak pathway having the same phenomenology as that previously documented for cells treated with t-butylhydroperoxide itself (fully recoverable; calcium-independent; inhibited at lower pH; K efflux balanced by Na influx). This leak pathway occurs in the absence of detectable secondary peroxidative change and appears to reflect a direct influence of lipid hydroperoxide. Using micropipette examination of vesicular bilayers reconstituted from RBC lipid extracts, we find that lipid from peroxidized RBC exhibits only a slight tendency to be less cohesive than normal lipid, apparently precluding isolated lipid properties as an explanation for altered permeability barrier function. However, addition of a hydrophobic membrane-spanning peptide to these same lipids significantly diminishes bilayer cohesion, an effect that is exacerbated further by the presence of peroxidized lipid. These observations suggest that lipid hydroperoxide is a necessary, but perhaps not sufficient, factor for induction of this unique leak pathway. Our results may be relevant to the abnormal cation homeostasis of sickle RBC in which deformation of an oxidatively perturbed membrane occurs during the sickling phenomenon.\r"

Following treatment with AET, erythrocyte MIRL and CR1 were no longer recognized in situ by antibodies, and antibody binding to DAF was diminished by approximately 50%. These studies indicated that the structural integrity of the three complement regulatory proteins was either partially (DAF) or completely (MIRL and CR1) disrupted by AET. Subsequent experiments showed that functional inactivation paralleled the structural disruption. Treatment of normal erythrocytes with AET induced susceptibility to cobra venom factor-initiated hemolysis, indicating that the functional activity of MIRL had been destroyed. The capacity of erythrocyte CR1 to serve as a cofactor for factor I-mediated cleavage of iC3b to C3c and C3dg was lost following treatment with AET. C3 convertase activity increase markedly following treatment of erythrocytes with AET, but convertase activity on AET cells was approximately 50% less than that observed when DAF function on normal cells was completely inhibited by antibody. Susceptibility of AET cells to acidified serum lysis was shown to be due primarily to inactivation of MIRL. Unexpectedly, in acidified serum the activity of the amplification C3 convertase of the APC was found to be controlled by MIRL as well as by DAF. These studies show that AET induces susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis by disrupting the structural and functional integrity of membrane constituents that regulate the activity of both the C3 convertases and the membrane attack complex of complement.\r"

We evaluated the fifth kindred with hereditary erythrocyte (RBC) AK deficiency. The proband had chronic hemolytic anemia. Her RBC had undetectable AK activity when measured spectrophotometrically, whereas those of her parents had half-normal AK activity. AK electrophoresis showed only AK-1 in the parents. The activities of pyruvate kinase and phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase were decreased given the young age of the proband's RBC. Despite the absence of spectrophotometric AK activity, the proband's RBC were able to incorporate 14C-adenine into 14C-adenine nucleotides at 50% of the rate expected for her young RBC population, suggesting the possibility of an alternative pathway for the formation of ADP from AMP. Normal hemolysate had AMP:guanosine triphosphate (GTP) phosphotransferase activity, which produced ADP at 8% to 9% of the rate of AK (6.8 +/- 0.8 IU/mL RBC). AMP:GTP phosphotransferase activity was not detectable in the proband's or parent's hemolysates. These additional biochemical defects in the AK-deficient RBC further support the concept that AK deficiency per se may not cause hemolytic anemia. We propose that defects occur in multiple phosphotransferases in the AK-deficient RBC and that these other biochemical defects may produce deleterious lesions that promote the shortened RBC survival in AK deficiency.\r"

Analysis of JT's serum by a monoclonal antibody-antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method showed the presence of anti-HPA-5b (anti-Bra) antibodies directed against an epitope on platelet glycoprotein (GP) la of the GPIa/IIa complex. The patient's serum immunoprecipitated two proteins from 125I-labeled HPA-5b positive platelets that migrated under both nonreducing and reducing conditions on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels at molecular weights characteristic of GPIa (150 Kd and 165 Kd, respectively) and GPIIa (120 Kd and 145 Kd, respectively). These bands were not precipitated when 125I-labeled HPA-5b negative platelets were used. Platelet typings performed on JT and her three children showed that the patient was HPA-5b negative and one of her children was HPA-5b positive. Platelets obtained from one of the donors who provided blood for the inciting transfusion also typed as HPA-5b positive. These findings demonstrate that posttransfusion purpura may be induced by antibodies directed against an alloantigenic epitope, namely HPA-5b (Bra), located on GPIa/IIa. Moreover, clinically significant bleeding can be associated with antibody reactions directed against this GP complex.\r"
