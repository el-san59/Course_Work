Clinical data are presented from 71 children aged 12 years or younger who constituted 2.7% of 2598 spinal cord-injured patients admitted to the authors' institutions from June, 1972, to June, 1986. The 47 children with traumatic spinal cord injury averaged 6.9 years of age and included 20 girls (43%). The etiology of the pediatric injuries differed from that of adult injuries in that falls were the most common causative factor (38%) followed by automobile-related injuries (20%). Ten children (21.3%) had spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA), whereas 27 (57%) had evidence of neurological injury. Complete neurological injury was seen in 19% of all traumatic pediatric spinal cord injuries and in 40% of those with SCIWORA. The most frequent level of spinal injury was C-2 (27%, 15 cases) followed by T-10 (13%, seven cases). Upon statistical examination of the data, a subpopulation of children aged 3 years or younger emerged. These very young children had a significant difference in level of injury, requirement for surgical stability, and sex distribution compared to 4- to 12-year-old children.\r"

Progressive neurological deficit occurred in all patients, but the clinical course and outcome were extremely variable. Myelography revealed an intramedullary lesion in two cases but was completely normal in three; magnetic resonance imaging was diagnostic in these patients. Subtotal removal was accomplished in two cases, and myelotomy and biopsy were carried out in three. Four of the cavernous angiomas were located in the cervicothoracic region, whereas one was found in the thoracolumbar cord. All of the patients exhibited characteristic gross and microscopic features as well as hemosiderin-laden macrophages indicating remote hemorrhage. The diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic implications of this rare condition are discussed.\r"

In a study of 41 cases of cerebellar astrocytoma and a review of the literature, no gross or microscopic factors that correlated with either of these two outcomes could be identified other than brain-stem involvement. The effect of radiation therapy in the treatment of primary or recurrent cerebellar astrocytomas was not detectable when analyzed the same way. Malignant recurrence of cerebellar astrocytoma and primary malignant tumors of the cerebellum are so rare that the possibility should not be taken as a reason to substitute radiation therapy for surgical excision repeated as necessary.\r"

  ".U": "88089879\r", 
  ".W": "Mortality due to epidural hematoma is virtually restricted to patients who undergo surgery for that condition while in coma. The authors have analyzed the factors influencing the outcome of 64 patients who underwent epidural hematoma evacuation while in coma. These patients represented 41% of the 156 patients operated on for epidural hematoma at their centers after the introduction of computerized tomography (CT). Eighteen patients (28.1%) died, two (3.1%) became severely disabled, and 44 (68.8%) made a functional recovery. The mortality rate for the entire series was 12%, significantly lower than the 30% rate observed when only angiographic studies were available. A significant correlation was found between the final result and the mechanism of injury, the interval between trauma and surgery, the motor score at operation, the hematoma CT density (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous), and the hematoma volume. The patient's age, the course of consciousness before operation (whether there was a lucid interval), and the clot location did not correlate with the final outcome. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients operated on within 6 hours or between 6 and 12 hours after injury than in those undergoing surgery 12 to 48 hours after injury. Compared with the patients operated on later, the patients undergoing surgery in the early period were, on the average, older and had more rapidly developing symptoms, more pupillary changes, lower motor scores at surgery, larger hematomas, a higher incidence of mixed CT density clots, more severe associated intracranial lesions, and higher postoperative intracranial pressure (ICP). The mechanism of trauma seems to influence the course of consciousness before and after surgery. Passengers injured in traffic accidents had a lower incidence of a lucid interval and longer postoperative coma than patients with low-speed trauma, suggesting more frequent association of diffuse white matter-shearing injury. The duration of postoperative coma correlated with the morbidity rate in survivors. Forty-eight patients (75%) had one or more associated intracranial lesions, and 70% of these required treatment for elevation of ICP after hematoma evacuation. An ICP of over 35 mm Hg strongly correlated with poor outcome; administration of high-dose barbiturates was the only effective means for lowering ICP in nine of 15 patients who developed severe intracranial hypertension after surgery. This study attempts to identify patients at greater risk for presenting postoperative complications and to define a strategy for control CT scanning and ICP monitoring.\r"

They were compared with CT scans in 14 cases of asymptomatic subdural pneumocephalus. In this study, two new CT findings were identified that suggest increased tension of the subdural air. Subdural air separates and compresses the frontal lobes, creating a widened interhemispheric space between the tips of the frontal lobes that mimics the silhouette of Mt. Fuji. The presence of air between the frontal tips associated with massive air inclusion over the frontal lobes presumably indicates increased tension of the subdural air. The \"Mt. Fuji sign\" was seen in four of the five cases with subdural tension pneumocephalus. The other finding was the presence of multiple small air bubbles scattered through several cisterns (\"air bubble sign\"). It is postulated that these air bubbles enter the subarachnoid space through a tear in the arachnoid membrane caused by increased tension of air in the subdural space. This finding was seen in four cases with subdural tension pneumocephalus. These two CT findings are helpful in making a diagnosis of subdural tension pneumocephalus following surgery for chronic subdural hematoma.\r"

Implantation was performed using computerized tomography-guided placement of afterloading catheters, and the 252 Cf sources were removed after approximately 300 neutron rads were delivered. Patients then received 6000 to 7000 conventional photon rads by external beam. The total photon-equivalent dose to the tumor ranged from 8100 to 9100 rads. The median survival time was 10 months, with 18-and 24-month survival rates of 28% and 19%, respectively. The results of reoperation or autopsy showed that patients had recurrence of the tumor but that radiation necrosis was restricted to the area of the original tumor. Serious complications occurred in five patients (9%) and consisted of wound infections in three, cerebral edema in one, and radiation necrosis beyond the original tumor margin in one. Previous studies using external-beam neutron radiation have shown that neutrons are capable of totally eradicating malignant gliomas; however, in most cases, unacceptable widespread radiation necrosis has resulted. Neutron implants are a logical way to increase the dose to the tumor and decrease the dose to normal brain. Interstitial neutron radiation can be given safely with 252Cf, and the survival results achieved by radiation alone using relatively low doses of interstitial neutron radiation from 252Cf implants plus conventional photon radiation were equal to the results attained with any currently available conventional therapy.\r"

Irradiated tumors contained lower PA activity than nonirradiated tumors. Finally, a slight but definite correlation between brain edema and PA activity was detected. The future role of brain-tumor PA's for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is discussed.\r"

Loss of vision with optic nerve atrophy is the most common neurological finding and is traditionally believed to be the result of optic nerve compression within the compromised optic canal. However, retinal degeneration has recently been described and is hypothesized to be the etiology of the visual loss (thus challenging the value of surgical decompression). The authors report their experience with six children suffering from osteopetrosis and severe visual loss. All six patients underwent bilateral microsurgical optic nerve decompression through a supraorbital craniotomy. Improvement in visual acuity occurred postoperatively in five patients, and none had complications. Two technical points are emphasized: 1) optic nerve decompression should be wide and include not only unroofing of the canal but also drilling along both sides of the optic nerve, and 2) the thick, irregular, and highly domed orbital roof should be smoothed down by high-speed drilling to facilitate surgical exposure with minimal retraction of the frontal lobe.\r"

Experimental exponent (A) values lay in the range -0.28-0.64 with a mean of -0.43 while intercept (B) values varied from 3 to 18. Spherical and cylindrical tumor models implied exponents of -0.33 and -0.5, respectively. Comparison of three implantation sites of the human LS174T xenograft revealed a narrow range of exponents (-0.38- -0.46) indicating a consistent geometry for this tumor. Blood flow to the lesion site and inside its volume (as dictated by tumor size) are factors in tumor uptake. Our results indicate that biodistribution data should include the variation of tumor uptake with mass. For less than 10 g lesions, we predict that radiation absorbed dose will be highly dependent upon tumor size.\r"

To detect gastric urease, we examined 32 patients who were being evaluated for possible peptic ulcer disease. Fasting patients were given 10 microCi (370 kBq) of 14C-labeled urea. Breath samples were collected in hyamine at intervals between 1 and 30 min. The amount of 14C collected at these times was expressed as: body weight X (% of administered dose of 14C in sample)/(mmol of CO2 collected). The presence of C. pylori colonization was also determined by examination of multiple endoscopic gastric biopsy specimens. On average, patients who were proven to have C. pylori infection exhaled 20 times more labeled CO2 than patients who were not infected. The difference between infected patients and C. pylori negative \"control\" patients was highly significant at all time points between 2 and 30 min after ingestion of the radionuclide (p less than 0.0001). The noninvasive urea breath is less expensive than endoscopic biopsy of the stomach and more accurate than serology as a means of detecting Campylobacter pylori infection. Because the test detects actual viable CP organisms, it can be used to confirm eradication of the bacterium after antibacterial therapy.\r"

A successful technique consists of ethyl acetate extraction of the metabolites from tissue samples acidified with perchloric acid, separation of the mixture by high performance liquid chromatography, and quantitation of the radioactive components with a sensitive scintillation detector. Metabolism of iofetamine HCI 123I proceeds sequentially from the N-isopropyl group on the amphetamine side chain. The first step, dealkylation to the primary amine p-iodoamphetamine (PIA), occurs readily in the brain, lungs, and liver; activity in the brain and lungs consists of only IMP and PIA even 24 hr after administration. The rate-limiting step appears to be deamination to give the transitory intermediate p-iodophenylacetone, which is rapidly degraded to p-iodobenzoic acid and conjugated with glycine in the liver to give the end product of metabolism, p-iodohippuric acid, which is excreted through the kidneys in the urine.\r"

It appears that the scintigraphic study with quantitation of duodenal-gastric reflux after corrections for the overlap of the stomach by the liver and bowel is more reliable, noninvasive, and physiologic. Fifty-four patients were divided into groups according to their clinical presentation; seven asymptomatic volunteers, 20 patients with duodenal-gastric reflux gastropathy (DRG), 16 patients with recurrent ulcers of the duodenal bulb (RUD), and 11 patients with Moynihan's disease. Each of the 47 dyspeptic patients underwent an endoscopic examination and a scintigraphic study with [99mTc]disofenin for detection and quantitation of duodenal-gastric reflux. Endoscopy revealed the presence of bile in the stomach of 16 out of 20 DRG and four out of 16 RUD, while ten out of 11 patients with Moynihan's disease had clear gastric juice. Most of the DRG cases (15 out of 20) and half of the RUD (eight out of 16) presented reflux greater than 1.5%, while of the 11 Moynhihan, ten presented reflux less than 1.5% and all the asymptomatic volunteer subjects less than 1%. This quantitation method allowed us to perceive clearly the low % of reflux in the \"normal asymptomatic\" subjects compared with the DRG-type of dyspeptic patients. Among the dyspeptic, the distinction seems more evident between the DRG type and the Moynihan type. Occasionally, the scintigraphic method permits identification of patients with slower gallbladder evacuation (eight out of 47 dyspeptic in our study), adding valuable information for the diagnostic approach to dyspeptic patients.\r"

We found that in acute infection the sensitivity of GRAN and MIX were both high and not statistically different. In chronic infections the sensitivities were lower than for acute infections. Again, there was no significant difference between GRAN and MIX with the borderline significant exception of MIX being superior to GRAN in chronic soft tissue infections (p = 0.06). We then had independent observers blindly grade the degree of lesion visualization. We found that delayed images visualized the lesions better than early images (p = 0.0001) and acute infection was better visualized than chronic infection (p = 0.03). We concluded that, in routine clinical practice, MIX is probably the agent of choice for three reasons: (a) easier preparation, (b) comparable sensitivity in acute infection and, (c) borderline superior sensitivity in chronic infection.\r"

Four quantitative parameters were defined as follows: (a) hemovelocity and (b) blood pool (determined from the Fourier processing of angiographic data); (c) early (3-5 min) and (d) delayed (2-3 hr) bone fixation. Three significant stages of RSD were demonstrated scintigraphically. Stage I (0-20 wk from onset) demonstrated increases in velocity, blood pool, and early and delayed fixations. At stage II (20-60 wk) blood velocity and blood pool were normalized, but early and delayed hyperfixation persisted. During stage III (60-100 wk) blood velocity and blood pool were reduced on the affected hand, and early and delayed fixations were normalized. Such abnormality of decreased hemodynamic parameters may become associated with bone hypofixation in stage III. Early treatment of RSD (as compared with delayed treatment) has been demonstrated to induce normalization of hemovelocity (p less than 0.05), blood pool (p less than 0.02), and joint stiffness (p less than 0.001) without any change in the bone fixation; therefore, three-phase bone scanning may provide useful information regarding the pathophysiologic and clinical evolution of RSD.\r"

Technetium-99m (V)DMSA demonstrated most of the tumor sites in eight patients with proven metastases, with an overall sensitivity of 95% in lesion detection. Iodine-131 MIBG showed definite uptake in some of the tumor sites in three of the nine patients imaged, with equivocal uptake seen in a further one patient, with sensitivity of only 11% for lesion detection. Technetium-99m MDP demonstrated bony metastases only, in four of the patients imaged yielding a sensitivity of 61%. Technetium-99m (V)DMSA has been demonstrated in this study to be a useful imaging agent in patients with MCT, showing uptake in significantly more lesions and with better imaging qualities than [131I]MIBG, and with the ability to detect soft tissue as well as bony metastases.\r"

Patients received a fixed dose of 1 mg of [111In]9.2.27, with no additional 9.2.27 (five patients), or co-infused with 49 mg (five patients) or 99 mg (one patient) of unlabeled, unconjugated 9.2.27. Higher doses resulted in prolonged blood-pool retention, less uptake in spleen and bone marrow, and appeared to have a positive effect in improving tumor imaging. A dose of 1 mg of 9.2.27 permitted detection of tumors in two of five patients and two of ten lesions, while with greater than or equal to 50 mg, tumors were detected in all patients and in 24 of 32 lesions. Human gamma globulin injected prior to administration of [111In]9.2.27 failed to block the prominent liver, spleen, and bone marrow uptake. No toxicity was observed. These results indicate the feasibility of imaging metastatic melanoma with [111In]9.2.27 and suggest that antibody dose may be a critical determinant of biodistribution and tumor uptake.\r"

  ".W": "Hexakis (2-methoxy isobutylisonitrile) technetium-99m [(99mTc]MIBI), a new tracer of myocardial blood flow, was compared with 201TI CI in cultures of myocardial cells of newborn rats. The kinetics of uptake and release of both tracers were assessed in basal conditions and in the presence of 5 mM cyanide, an inhibitor of the respiratory chain, 0.1 mM iodoacetate, an inhibitor of glycolysis, 10 microM ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na-K ATPase, or with various pH values. The amplitude and frequency of contractions of the cells were also monitored in the same conditions. Results show that the washin and washout kinetics of [99mTc]MIBI are slower than 201TI(T1/2) of the washout curves were, respectively, of 28 min and 6 min). The kinetics of release of both tracers were not influenced by any of the inhibitors. There was a strong effect of the pH on the 201TI uptake only. Moreover 201TI uptake was decreased by 34% in the presence of cyanide plus iodoacetate. Otherwise the uptakes of 201TI and [99mTc]MIBI were not decreased by any of the drugs. The cellular contractility was significantly diminished by cyanide and it was abolished by cyanide plus iodoacetate. It is concluded that (a) impaired contractility can be associated with normal 201TI and [99mTc]MIBI kinetics in myocardial cells in culture, (b) that 201TI uptake may depend on the level of ATP devoted to the maintenance of membrane integrity, (c) that [99mTc]MIBI shows slower kinetics but is less sensitive to metabolic inhibitors than 201TI.\r"

  ".W": "Cellular kinetics and binding characteristics of hexakis(carbomethoxyisopropylisonitrile) technetium(I) (Tc-CPI), a new cationic, highly lipophilic myocardial perfusion imaging agent, were evaluated in chick embryo heart cells grown in monolayer culture. Myocytes showed uptake of Tc-CPI to a plateau level with a half-time (t1/2) of 4.1 +/- 0.7 min (mean +/- s.e.m.; n = 6); t1/2 appeared independent of extracellular Tc-CPI concentration. Plateau level Tc-CPI uptakes (10(-16) to 10(-11) mole Tc-CPI/mg cell protein) were a linear function of extracellular Tc-CPI concentration (range: 10(-13)M to 10(-8)M, respectively). Tracer 99mTc-CPI uptake (binding) was not competitively displaced by carrier 99Tc-CPI. Uptake was temperature-sensitive; however, several inhibitors of cationic membrane transport (ouabain, amiloride, bumetanide, and verapamil) showed no significant effect. Extreme alkalinization of external load solution (pHo approximately 8.5) partially inhibited Tc-CPI uptake; however, intracellular pH changes showed no effect. Washout from contractile preparations could be described by a two component system: a fast component (myocytes) with a t1/2 approximately 4.5 min and a slow component (fibroblasts) with a t1/2 approximately 40 min. Cell fractionation experiments showed most of the activity to be associated with the cell membrane fraction. The data do not demonstrate a specific mechanism for uptake of Tc-CPI; however, results suggest binding to myocytes in a manner proportional to the delivery of the complex to the extracellular spaces. Such properties would be desirable for a myocardial perfusion imaging agent.\r"

A new complex has been synthesized, [99mTc(DEPE)2(CNR)2], +(DEPIC), where R = t - butyl isocyanide, which in three animal species images the myocardium very well, but in humans it remains primarily in the blood pool. One reason for the difference in the behavior of these complexes in different species could be the characteristics of their binding to plasma proteins. The protein binding characteristics of DEPIC and two other well-known complexes have therefore been studied. Whereas the other complexes bind nonspecifically to many proteins both in animal and human plasma, DEPIC binds almost exclusively to prealbumin in humans but nonspecifically to other proteins in the rabbit. The binding sites in human plasma appear to be those normally occupied by thyroxine on the prealbumin tetramer and these can be blocked by sodium salicylate.\r"

Synthesis of this novel branched-chain fatty acid was accomplished by copper-catalyzed addition of tetradecylmagnesium bromide to diethylisopropylidenemalonate. Subsequent saponification and decarboxylation afforded 3,3-dimethylheptadecanoic acid (DMHDA) that was converted to the corresponding alkyl bromide by means of a modified Hunsdiecker reaction. Carboxylation of 2,2-dimethylhexadecylmagnesium bromide with 11CO2 gave [11C]DMHDA. Carbon-11 DMHDA showed moderate myocardial uptake in fasted rats, albeit lower than that reported for the 3-monomethyl analog. Considerable washout of radioactivity from the heart was also observed over the first 30 min postinjection. Imaging in dogs likewise showed disappointing heart uptake with much higher localization in the lung. These data suggest that gem-dimethyl substitution of the beta-position in long chain fatty acids is not only insufficient for enhanced myocardial uptake and retention, but also, may be deleterious when compared with beta-monomethylation.\r"

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (chiefly T cells) had the highest levels in the blood and lymph nodes, a relatively higher level in intestine and a lower level in the spleen than other suspensions. Thymocytes cleared promptly from the blood, accumulated markedly in the liver, moderately in the spleen, but very poorly in other organs, including the thymus. Splenic cells (rich in B cells) sequestered predominantly in the spleen and liver. Splenic cells nonadherent to nylon wool (T-cell enriched) had a relatively high uptake in lymph nodes and marrow. Splenic cells from thymectomized rats (NK cell enriched) localized predominantly in the liver and spleen, and poorly in lymph nodes. We conclude that the source organ for harvesting rat lymphocytes is an important determinant in their localization, as well as other factors such as the techniques of isolation, the toxicity and stability of the radioactive label and the cell radiation dose from internalized radioactivity.\r"

Growth and feed efficiency were reduced significantly by lead. The lead-associated growth depression was less severe in chicks fed the low niacin diet as indicated by a significant lead X niacin interaction. The relative weights of two brain regions (telencephalon and diencephalon) and the adrenal glands were greater in lead-treated chicks than in their nonlead-treated counterparts. Plasma and telencephalon tryptophan were lower in lead-treated chicks than in nonlead-treated chicks. Diencephalon tryptophan was lower in chicks fed the LN diet than in chicks fed the control diet. Brain serotonin was lower and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was higher in both brain regions of lead-treated chicks than in nonlead-treated chicks. The data indicate that tryptophan and serotonin metabolism were altered by lead treatment, whereas niacin was without effect. The interaction of lead and niacin on growth does not appear to be related to alterations of serotonin metabolism in the central nervous system.\r"

Percentage of absorbed Na excreted in urine was correlated with the rise in blood pressure of SHR but not of WKY rats during the first 4 wk of the study. At 13 wk balances of all four nutrients still tended to be higher in SHR. During the 16th wk of life, after onset of hypertension, Na, Ca and P balances were similar in SHR and WKY rats, but Mg balance was significantly lower in SHR. The percent urinary excretion of absorbed Na was lower in SHR at 9 wk of age, but after onset of hypertension it was similar to that in WKY rats. Food intake was always greater in SHR, whereas growth during the study was less, and absorption of Ca, Mg and P declined more rapidly with age in SHR than in WKY rats. The data suggest that nutrient malabsorption in SHR, if it occurs at all, is most likely an effect of, rather than a cause of, hypertension.\r"

Histologic examination showed a normal aspect of the thoracic aorta from HC rats, whereas in HP, moderate signs of vascular aging--thicker intima and media with hypertrophy of smooth muscular cells (smc) with collagen enrichment and diffuse fibrosis--were observed. Aortas from MET rats also exhibited thicker intima and media due to smc hypertrophy. Some smc presented degenerative aspects and necrosis; other smc were replaced by chondroid cells and foci of fibrosis, resulting in a loss of the distension capacity of the aorta.

Lymph containing [3H]retinyl esters and small amounts of [3H]retinol and [3H]retinaldehyde was collected from these rats and an aliquot was injected into the jugular vein of a second group of mesenteric lymph duct-cannulated rats. The total radioactivity recovered in 24-h lymph collections from recipient rats was only 1.6% of that injected, and the [3H]retinyl esters, [3H]retinol and [3H]retinaldehyde recovered was only 0.9% of that injected. Thus, the amount of vitamin A recovered in the enterohepatic route in forms that can be reutilized by the body for vision and reproduction appears to be very small. Notable differences were observed in the composition of mesenteric lymph containing newly absorbed vitamin A and mesenteric lymph containing recycled vitamin A. In the former, 87% of the total lymph radioactivity was associated with retinyl esters, 5% with retinol, 3% with retinaldehyde and 5% with unidentified mostly nonpolar compounds.

Here the absorption, retention, tissue distribution and tissue levels of iron were compared in lean (+/?) and obese (ob/ob) C57BL/6J mice to examine the impact of obesity on the iron status of this animal model. Obese mice absorbed and retained approximately twice as much 59Fe as lean mice after receiving a solution containing 1 mumol iron per os. This difference was independent of age, severity of obesity and mass of the gastrointestinal tract. Obese mice fed ad libitum had higher levels of 59Fe in blood and fat pads, but lower amounts of 59Fe in the skeletal-muscular system, than lean mice 6 d after subcutaneous injection of 1 mumol of the metal. At least 30% of carcass 59Fe was present in the liver of obese and lean mice 6 d after injection. Despite significantly lower concentrations of iron in liver and bone, blood hemoglobin and hematocrit were significantly higher in obese mice fed ad libitum than in lean mice at 10 wk of age. Plasma iron and transferrin were not affected by chronic obesity. Although several characteristics of iron metabolism differed in obese and lean mice, the results indicate that ob/ob mice were not iron deficient when fed a diet containing an adequate level of this micronutrient. The increased absorption of iron by obese mice probably represents an adaptive response that is required to supply additional micronutrient for the expanded blood volume in these animals.\r"

Net absorption of zinc from the duodenum before and after ligation of the common bile duct averaged 596 and 574 ng.min-1.cm-1, respectively. Zinc absorption was greater (P less than 0.01) from the duodenum than from the jejunum (251 ng.min-1.cm-1) or ileum (404 ng.min-1.cm-1). Four other dogs (group 2) experienced perfusion of approximately equal segments of the duodenum (in two animals the common bile duct was ligated, and in another two it was not), proximal jejunum and distal ileum for 4 h. No change in absorption of zinc with time was noted, nor was any difference in absorption by the duodenum with and without ligation of the common bile duct observed. The data indicate that the duodenum has the greatest capacity for zinc absorption, followed by the distal ileum and proximal jejunum, and that pancreatic secretions do not appear to be necessary for adequate zinc absorption in the dog duodenum.\r"

Body weight gain (mean +/- SEM) with 0-PYR was 70 +/- 9.0 and 81.2 +/- 4.2 g for FF and C, respectively. All other groups gained 170-180 g. Urinary excretion of 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA), a major B-6 metabolite, for FF groups was 1.31 +/- 0.22, 2.26 +/- 0.28 and 6.39 +/- 1.73 micrograms/24 h, at 0-, 2- and 6.9-PYR, respectively. Rats fed WB diets excreted 4.99 +/- 0.58 and 9.81 +/- 0.76 micrograms/24 h (3.9- and 5.5-PYR, respectively) and those fed C diets excreted 1.46 +/- 0.34 and 2.69 +/- 0.72 micrograms/24 h (0- and 2-PYR). There was increasing turnover and shorter biological half-life of [14C]pyridoxine (1 mu Ci injected on d 1) with increasing dietary B-6. Growth, 4-PA and 14C turnover data indicated that WB contributed to B-6 intake of these rats. Cellulose acted as a simple dietary diluent and had no effect on indices of B-6 status. These data suggest that dietary fiber, as cellulose or the indigestible component of wheat bran, does not adversely affect the bioavailability of vitamin B-6.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of lactose supplementation on endochondral bone growth, bone development and mineralization in weanling rats fed a vitamin D-deficient diet. Rat pups were weaned from vitamin D-deficient dams and fed a vitamin D-deficient diet containing sucrose as the primary carbohydrate source or a similar diet but containing 20% lactose. After 4 wk, body weights, serum calcium levels and endochondral bone elongation rates in the lactose-fed animals were higher than in rats fed the sucrose diet. In addition, bone weights, bone calcium content, percent bone ash of bone dry weight, percent metaphyseal osseous tissues and bone osteoid content in the lactose-fed rats were different from those in the rats fed the sucrose diet. In all cases the changes in osseous tissues that were observed in the animals fed the lactose-supplemented diet were toward normal values as observed in age-matched animals fed a vitamin D-replete diet. The improvements in bone growth and development due to lactose supplementation occurred independent of the vitamin D endocrine system and are likely the result of improved calcium absorption in the intestine.\r"

All provided 6.4-6.7% of energy as protein and 9.3-10.1% as fat. Balances were carried out during the last 6 d of the three 9-d amaranth periods and during the four control periods. Fecal wet and dry weights during amaranth diets were 129-157% of those during casein control diets; fecal energy, fat and carbohydrate from the toasted flour periods were 193, 268 and 256%; from the popped grain 253, 586 and 195%; and from the flakes 225, 356 and 255% of those during casein diets. Apparent N absorptions were 84.1-84.6% of the casein values (P less than 0.001); apparent retentions from toasted, popped and flaked amaranth were 70.9, 65.9 and 59.0% of casein (P less than 0.001). The last of these was significantly lower than the first (P less than 0.05). Fecal fat was much higher (P less than 0.001) from the popped than from the flaked grain and the toasted flour. Toasted flour was then added to maize meal so that amaranth provided 20 or 30% of the protein. Seven young children received diets in which 6.4% of total energy came from one of the above mixes, or from casein, as protein. Soya-cottonseed oils completed 25% lipid energy in all three diets; balance of energy was from sucrose in the experimental diets and from sucrose, corn syrup solids and cornstarch in the casein diet.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirteen groups of ddY male mice were fed purified diets covering the entire range (0-100%) of protein concentration on a gross energy basis for 68 d. The food intake and body weight data in each group were analyzed by nonlinear regression to obtain values of the six parameters in Parks' feeding and growth equations. These parameters, found as a function of the protein content of diet, were then used to construct the response surfaces of food intake and body weight over the dietary protein versus age space. At every protein level the daily energy intake rose rapidly with age to a plateau at about 7-14 d after weaning and was maintained throughout the experiment. Daily energy intake was independent of the dietary protein content except at very low dietary protein contents. Consequently, from 21 to 89 d of age daily protein intake was directly proportional to dietary protein level. These results imply that mice ate for energy rather than protein when fed diets varying in protein content in the range of 10-80%. Body weight as a function of time after weaning increased to a plateau at every dietary protein level, but the details of the pattern of growth were affected by the dietary protein level. Further, the response surface of body weight versus dietary protein level and age was analyzed to find the protein requirement of mice for maximal growth during a given interval from weaning.\r"

The remaining two groups went through three cycles of pregnancy/lactation (PL-3) or pregnancy/no lactation (PNL-3) and were then killed for carcass composition analysis. Two virgin groups (CON-1, CON-3) served as age controls and were killed at the appropriate time. There was a gradual reduction in food intake from cycle 1 to cycle 3 for all groups. PL-3 rats ingested significantly more food than PNL-3 rats in pregnancies of cycle 2 and cycle 3. At the end of cycle 1, there was no difference in body weight, carcass weight, fat content and fat cell cellularity in parametrial and subcutaneous fat pads between three groups of rats. However, after three cycles, the PL-3 group had significantly reduced carcass fat content because of a significant reduction in fat cell number. Repeated pregnancy followed by no lactation resulted in greater carcass fat content and fat cell number in the subcutaneous pad than observed in lactating rats, although these increases failed to reach significance when compared with virgin controls. Thus lactation may not only be beneficial to the offspring but also enhances maternal weight loss and prevents obesity in multiparous individuals.\r"

In experiment 1, 25 male Long-Evans rats were each implanted with two gelatin capsules containing mineralized bone (MB) powder subcutaneously in the thorax region. At 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 d after implantation the acid phosphatase activity (resorption) increased significantly (P less than 0.01), whereas alkaline phosphatase activity (formation) did not change. In experiment 2, both MB and demineralized bone (DB) powder were implanted on contralateral dorsal sites of the thorax in 40 male Long-Evans rats and harvested after 7, 9, 11 and 13 d. Enzyme, mineral and histological assessment indicated bone formation in DB implants with bone resorption in MB implants. In experiment 3, the effects of dietary calcium (0.2 or 1.0%) and vitamin D (cholecalciferol at 300 ng/d or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25(OH)2D3] at 75 ng/d) were examined using 40 male Long-Evans rats. These rats were implanted with both DB and MB powders and the implants were harvested on d 12. Both low (0.2%) dietary calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulated resorption of MB implants. Therefore, the physiological processes of bone formation and resorption were mimicked in this system of bone powder implants. Further, dietary calcium and 1,25(OH)2D3 were shown to modulate these processes.\r"

Blood lead levels ranged from 13 to 97 micrograms/dL. To determine whether a threshold exists between blood lead level and maximal motor nerve conduction velocity, we conducted three regression analyses on these data: a \"hockey stick\" regression, a logistic regression, and a quadratic regression. We found evidence for a threshold in all three analyses: at a blood level of 30 micrograms/dL in the \"hockey stick\" regression, at 20 micrograms/dL in the logistic, and at 25 to 30 micrograms/dL in the quadratic. Neither age, sex, socioeconomic status, nor duration of residence near the smelter significantly modified the relationship. These analyses confirm that asymptomatic increased lead absorption causes slowing of nerve conduction, but they also indicate that measurement of maximal motor nerve conduction velocity is an insensitive screen for low-level lead toxicity.\r"

There was no difference between the two groups in the regimen used to treat relapses, steroid responsiveness, number of patients with relapses, and frequency of toxic reactions to steroids. However, the number of patients with a relapse within 6 months after initial therapy and the number of those with frequent relapses or steroid dependence were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (P less than 0.05 for both).

All infants were observed with their mothers during maternal visits to the nursery and during home visits 1, 3, 6, and 9 months after discharge. The mothers' reactions to their infants were rated at these times. All the children were followed up at a neonatal clinic, and detailed clinic records were used to document the time when a physician first suspected a delay and when this delay was first mentioned to the mother. The results indicate that parents had usually been told of their child's handicap by the time the child was 6 to 9 months old; yet mothers of the delayed children changed the interaction with their children as early as 1 month after discharge from hospital. These mothers initially touched, smiled at, and talked to their developmentally delayed infants significantly more often, but by 9 months they did so much less often than mothers of nondelayed children. The degree of change in mothers' behavior was related to their psychosocial background, with better-adjusted mothers showing the most change. We conclude that mothers' statements about their infants are usually valid and that physicians may share their potential concerns about infants more freely.\r"

The groups were balanced for gestational age, sex, neonatal risk factors, and maternal age, parity, socioeconomic status, and race. Behaviors indicative of infant feeding difficulties were coded for mother and infant. The SGA mothers had higher frequencies of these behaviors than did their AGA counterparts. Qualitative ratings of interactive behavior were recorded for mother and infant: SGA infants had ratings indicative of less optimal interactions than those of the AGA group. Infant caloric intake (calories per kilogram per feeding) was calculated by first dividing the change in infant weight in grams before feeding and immediately after feeding by the infant's weight before feeding and then converting it to calories. Although no difference in caloric intake was observed between the two groups, infant behaviors and ratings were associated with caloric intake. These data suggest the importance of including neonatal behavior during feeding in the risk assessment of potential growth failure in SGA infants.\r"

Postnatal growth failure and microcephaly, observed in a significant proportion of patients (46.7% and 30%, respectively), could be attributed to chronic illnesses and to progressive central nervous system lesions in HIV-infected patients. There were however, no significant differences between patients and controls with regard to the incidence of craniofacial features and dermatoglyphics, and the incidence of other anomalies was not different from that expected in the population. The patients born to drug-using mothers were not different from those born to non-drug-using mothers in relation to the studied criteria. We could not confirm the presence of characteristic craniofacial dysmorphism in children exposed to perinatal HIV infection.\r"

We studied 13 infants with BPD but without other medical problems that could contribute to growth failure at 6 months' corrected age. We measured resting oxygen consumption (Vo2), Pao2, airway resistance, specific airway conductance, and dynamic pulmonary compliance (Cdyn) by body plethysmography and growth. Growth failure was defined as height and weight less than the tenth percentile of the Babson growth curves. Vo2 in infants with growth failure and BPD was markedly elevated compared with that in control infants and infants with BPD and normal growth. Vo2 showed an inverse correlation with body weight in infants with BPD but not in control infants. Although Vo2 was inversely related to Cdyn, the total work of breathing only partially explained the increased metabolic demands of the growth failure group. We speculate that growth failure in infants with BPD is partially the result of increased metabolic demands from increased work of breathing but that other mechanisms may act to elevate the metabolic expenditure of these infants.\r"

The first intravenous dose of 15 mg/kg was given at a mean age of 110 minutes, followed by 15 mg/kg after 4 hours and then by 5 mg/kg at 24-hour intervals for 5 days. The overall incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage was 32% in treated and 46% in control infants, a nonsignificant difference. An ultrasound brain scan at 9 months old revealed no significant difference in the incidence of ventricular dilatation between treated (19%) and control (29%) infants. At 27 months, a similar incidence of mild (10%) and severe (10%) neurodevelopmental handicaps was found in both treated and control groups. Since beneficial effects could not be documented by any of the criteria used, we conclude that routine administration of phenobarbital to low birth weight infants is not justified.\r"

Ventilation was measured in 12 healthy preterm infants (postconceptional age 34 +/- 2 weeks) by employing a nasal mask pneumotachygraph that separated airflow between the left and right nasal passages. In the midline supine position, the percent of total tidal volume (%VT) through the right nasal passage ranged from 31% to 64% and varied by less than 5% between active and quiet sleep in any infant. Lateral positioning of the head caused %VT to increase on the dependent side and decrease through the upper nasal passage. When the right side was dependent, mean %VT on that side increased from 52 +/- 9% to 67 +/- 14% (P less than 0.01) and decreased to 43 +/- 10% (P less than 0.05) when the right side was up. In the midline position, the presence of a nasogastric tube caused %VT through the nasal passage with the tube to fall from 54 +/- 8% to 39 +/- 8% (P less than 0.01). The %VT fell farther, to 25 +/- 10% (P less than 0.01), when the nasal passage with the nasogastric tube was up. Despite these changes in VT distribution, total VT remained constant during these maneuvers. We speculate that when supine preterm infants adopt a lateral head position, the decrease in airflow through the upper nasal passage results from partial obstruction of the oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway on that side.\r"

  ".W": "To characterize the responses of the canine coronary artery to serotonin, rings with and without endothelium were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Serotonin evoked an endothelium-dependent relaxation of prostaglandin F2 alpha-contracted rings which was inhibited by antagonists with affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1 and 5-HT2 receptors, methiothepin and metergoline, but was not mimicked or antagonized by the 5-HT1A-selective ligand, 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino tetralin. This relaxation is not mediated by 5-HT1B receptors as it was not antagonized by cyanopindolol; similarly, lack of inhibition by ketanserin and MDL 72222 rule out contributions of 5-HT2 receptors or 5-HT3 receptors. Rings without endothelium contracted to serotonin; this contraction was not blocked by cyanopindolol and was only weakly inhibited by ketanserin, but was antagonized in an apparently competitive fashion by methiothepin and was mimicked by 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino tetralin (although at higher concentrations than would be expected for its action at a 5-HT1A receptor). At high concentrations, serotonin evoked a relaxation of endothelium-denuded rings, which was blocked by very low concentrations of methiothepin but was unaffected by ketanserin or cyanopindolol. Thus, there appear to be three different serotonergic receptors in the coronary artery. Although available agents do not allow their precise classification as yet, none of them is of the 5-HT2 type.\r"

A 1-hr i.v. infusion of phenylephrine (3 mg/kg/hr) resulted in a sustained 50% increase in diastolic blood pressure and 5% increase in heart rate. Chronic (6-day) infusion (3 mg/kg/hr) utilizing Alzet mini-osmotic pumps maintained plasma concentrations of phenylephrine at 1.0 microgram/ml, depleted myocardial norepinephrine stores 8-fold and resulted in a modest cardiac hypertrophy. Density and affinity of myocardial adrenoceptors and calcium channels were quantified by analyzing saturation isotherms of radioligand binding. [3H]Prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine bound specifically and with high affinity to cardiac alpha-1 and beta adrenoceptors and calcium channels, respectively. As measured by Scatchard analyses, phenylephrine infusion significantly decreased the maximum number (Bmax) of specific [3H]prazosin binding sites by 39% (430 +/- 20 vs. 263 +/- 16 fmol/mg of protein; P less than .05). Chronic phenylephrine treatment also decreased the Bmax for [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding by 31% (124 +/- 3.3 vs. 86 +/- 6.6 fmol/mg of protein; P less than .05) and the Bmax for [3H]nitrendipine binding by 32% (342 +/- 8.8 vs. 235 +/- 6.7 fmol/mg of protein; P less than .05). Binding affinities (Kd) of [3H]prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol and [3H]nitrendipine remained unchanged. Administration of vehicle alone or surgical manipulation due to osmotic pump implantation did not affect either the density or affinity of [3H]prazosin, [3H]dihydroalprenolol or [3H]nitrendipine binding. Contractile responses to phenylephrine were studied in isolated ventricular strips to determine the functional significance of alpha-1 adrenoceptor down-regulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Based upon binding studies with 5-HT2 receptors in brain cortical membranes and block of 5-HT-induced contractions in the rat jugular vein, LY281067 showed high affinity at 5-HT2 receptors with a dissociation constant of approximately 1 nM. Furthermore, LY281067 was a highly selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist without appreciably binding to 5-HT1, D1 or D2 receptors or interacting with histamine (H1), cholinergic, beta adrenergic or alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle. LY281067 had modest affinity at alpha-2 receptors with a dissociation constant of approximately 100 nM. Oral bioavailability of LY281067 in spontaneously hypertensive rats was excellent with an oral to i.v. dose ratio approximating 4, based upon blockade of pressor responses to 5-HT as an in vivo estimate of 5-HT2 receptor antagonist activity. Furthermore, LY281067 blocked quipazine-induced increase in serum corticosterone concentration, an increase thought to be mediated by activation of central 5-HT receptors. After oral administration to rats, LY281067 antagonized vascular 5-HT2 receptors with a relatively long duration of action (greater than 6 hr), an observation likely to be related to plasma concentrations of both the parent and an active metabolite. Lastly, LY281067 was relatively nontoxic, possessing a therapeutic index of approximately 1000 after oral administration to rats. In summary, LY281067 is a potent and highly selective, orally active 5-HT2 receptor antagonist with a relatively long duration and wide margin of therapeutic safety.\r"

  ".W": "This study examines stimulus-induced overflow of endogenous catecholamines from the isolated perfused kidney of rats after epinephrine (EPI) administration at 100 micrograms/kg/hr for 6 days via s.c. implanted osmotic minipumps. This regimen resulted in the incorporation of EPI into renal catecholamine stores and the co-release of EPI with norepinephrine during periarterial nerve stimulation. Stimulus-induced (1 Hz) absolute and fractional overflows of neurotransmitter were significantly greater in the EPI-treated rats. These differences in overflow were not altered by uptake blockade. Alpha adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine (10(-9)-10(-5) alone increased overflow in a dose-dependent manner in both groups, although to a greater extent in the EPI-treated group. However, in the presence of 1 microM propranolol the effect of phentolamine in the EPI-treated group was greatly reduced such that, in the presence of propranolol, phentolamine was less effective in the EPI-treated vs. vehicle-treated rats. Beta adrenoceptor blockade alone with propranolol (10(-9)-10(-6) M) did not alter stimulus-induced overflow in either group but propranolol dose dependently reduced fractional overflow in the EPI-treated rats when the experiments were done in the presence of 10 microM phentolamine. It is concluded that the enhanced fractional overflow observed in the kidneys of EPI-treated rats was not due to beta adrenoceptor activation, but rather, a reduced influence of the prejunctional alpha adrenoceptor-mediated negative feedback loop. Beta adrenoceptor activation by neurally released EPI does not appear to modulate stimulus-induced overflow unless the dominant inhibitory alpha adrenoceptor mechanism is inactivated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Oxmetidine is also cytotoxic to isolated rat hepatocytes through inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The purpose of this investigation was to test a variety of H2-receptor antagonists that are structural analogs of oxmetidine in an attempt to identify a critical structural component or a physicochemical property of the molecule which may be responsible for cytotoxicity. Six histamine receptor H2-antagonists were tested. The minimum drug concentrations that caused 100% cell death (leakage of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase and loss of intracellular potassium) ranged from 0.87 to 22.50 mM for the analogs tested. At toxic concentrations, two of the least potent analogs, SK&F 92909 and SK&F 9205A both caused a rapid decrease in hepatocyte O2 consumption and ATP content which occurred before any evidence of cell injury. The potency of these molecules as cytotoxicants to isolated hepatocytes did not correlate with their potency as histamine H2-receptor antagonists whereas there was a significant correlation between increasing potency and increasing octanol/water partition coefficients. These data suggest that lipid solubility may be a key factor in the cytotoxicity of this class of drugs to isolated rat hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "The hemolytic anemia which frequently accompanies treatment of individuals with dapsone and other arylamine drugs is believed to be caused not by the parent drugs per se, but rather by metabolites which are formed during the clearance of the drugs in vivo. To determine whether the N-hydroxyarylamine metabolites of dapsone could be responsible for dapsone-induced hemolysis, dapsone, dapsone hydroxylamine (DDS-NOH) and monoacetyldapsone hydroxylamine were administered to rats which had previously received 51Cr-labeled red blood cells. All three compounds caused an increase in the rate of disappearance of radioactivity from the blood as compared with saline-treated controls. In parallel in vitro studies, incubation of 51Cr-labeled red blood cells with DDS-NOH, but not dapsone or monoacetyldapsone, induced a decrease in survival time of the radiolabeled cells when they were reintroduced into isologous rats. The disappearance of radioactivity from the blood was matched by its selective uptake into the spleen. The amount of damage (as measured by decreased red cell survival in vivo) was proportional to both concentration and time of exposure to DDS-NOH. The area under the blood concentration vs. time curve for total arylhydroxylamines (DDS-NOH + monacetyldapsone hydroxylamine) in rats given a hemotoxic dose of dapsone was similar to that of rats given an equitoxic dose of DDS-NOH. Collectively, these data indicate that the hydroxylamine metabolites of dapsone are direct acting hemolytic agents that are formed from dapsone in sufficient amounts to account for their being the sole mediators of dapsone-induced hemolytic anemia in the rat.\r"

Naloxone reversed residual morphine-produced respiratory depression, miosis and subjective reports of drug \"high.\" In addition, naloxone precipitated signs and symptoms characteristic of opioid withdrawal. Subjective report measures of \"bad\" drug effects and specific opioid withdrawal symptoms increased as a function of morphine pretreatment dose, as did observer-rated signs of withdrawal. Yawning was the most prominent observed sign, whereas yawning and irritability were the most consistently reported subjective symptoms. Peak withdrawal effects were seen within 15 min post-naloxone. The results of this study confirm previous reports of acute physical dependence in man and extend those findings by demonstrating a morphine dose-response function.\r"

  ".U": "88090575\r", 
  ".W": "In this study, [125I]iodocyanopindolol ([125I]ICYP), in the presence of isoproterenol, was used to label 5-hydroxytryptamine1B (5-HT1B) receptors in homogenates of the cortex, substantia nigra and caudate-putamen of the rat. The determination of the appropriate concentrations of isoproterenol required to block optimally beta adrenoceptors whereas producing minimal occupancy of 5-HT1B receptors was achieved by generating isotherms for isoproterenol at multiple concentrations of [125I]ICYP. When different concentrations of isoproterenol were used with increasing concentrations of [125I]ICYP, a linear Scatchard transformation of the saturation curve was achieved, even with ligand concentrations about 6-fold greater than the KD for [125I]ICYP. Competition for [125I]ICYP (100 pM) labeled binding sites by 15 serotonin agonists or antagonists was adequately described by a single site model, and the affinity of these drugs for the site labeled by [125I]ICYP was similar to that determined previously when using indirect methods to label 5-HT1B receptors. Serotonin itself showed high affinity for this binding site as did two antagonists, metergoline and methiothepin. By contrast, drugs thought to be selective for the 5-HT1A receptor (e.g., 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, buspirone and spiperone) showed very weak affinity for the binding site labeled with [125I]ICYP. The effect of nucleotide regulation on [125I]ICYP binding at 5-HT1B receptors also was evaluated. It was determined that GTP had little effect on the binding of [125I]ICYP, reducing total binding by only 15% and shifting the displacement curve of 5-HT by a factor of less than two. The regulation of 5-HT1B receptors, labeled by [125I]ICYP, also was evaluated. Intraventricular injections of 5.7-dihydroxytryptamine increased significantly the number of 5-HT1B receptors in the caudate-putamen; this treatment had no effect on 5-HT1B binding sites either in the cortex or substantia nigra. The regulatable binding site for [125I]ICYP in the caudate-putamen had a pharmacological profile very similar to that of the 5-HT1B binding site in the cortex. [125I]ICYP appears to be a useful ligand to measure 5-HT1B receptors in the brain of the rat. The localized increase in 5-HT1B receptors in the caudate-putamen after destruction of central serotonergic neurons might indicate that the majority of 5-HT1B receptors in this area of brain are not located on serotonergic nerve terminals.\r"

Although 5-HT in vitro did not influence maximum binding and Kd values of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding or the IC50 value for isoproterenol as estimated from competition binding curves in cortical tissue from control animals, 5-HT abolished the increase in beta adrenoceptor number and the marked elevation of the IC50 value for isoproterenol in cortical membrane preparations after selective lesions with 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT). Nonlinear regression analysis of competition binding curves revealed that the increase in the maximum binding of beta adrenoceptors after 5,7-DHT is due exclusively to an increase in beta adrenoceptors in the agonist low affinity conformation and that it is this receptor population that is reduced by nanomolar concentrations of 5-HT. The increase in the density of beta adrenoceptors in the low affinity conformation occurred approximately 11 days after the lesions and remained elevated throughout the experimental period of 28 days. Ritanserin in a dose that virtually abolished 5-HT2 receptor binding in cortex did not mimic the effect of 5,7-DHT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Experiments were designed to determine the mechanism of action of the bronchodilator drug tulobuterol. Tissues were suspended in organ chambers for isometric tension recording. Tulobuterol caused concentration-dependent relaxations of guinea pig tracheae, canine saphenous veins and canine bronchi; the compound relaxed canine coronary arteries only at high concentrations and did not affect spontaneously beating guinea pig atria. A metabolite of tulobuterol, 4-hydroxytulobuterol, was more potent in relaxing guinea pig tracheae than tulobuterol, salbutamol and isoproterenol. Other metabolites (3-hydroxy-, 5-hydroxy- and 4,5-dihydroxytulobuterol) were less efficacious than 4-hydroxytulobuterol. Both tulobuterol and 4-hydroxytulobuterol acted as partial agonists. The effects of tulobuterol in the saphenous vein (but not in the coronary artery) were antagonized by the selective beta-2 adrenergic blocker ICI 118,551 but were not affected by the selective beta-1 adrenergic inhibitor metoprolol. In bronchi, removal of the epithelium reduced the relaxations caused by tulobuterol. The drug did not inhibit responses of canine bronchi to electrical stimulation of the cholinergic nerves more than those to exogenous acetylcholine. Tulobuterol caused a moderate augmentation of the evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine in canine saphenous veins previously incubated with the labeled transmitter. Thus, tulobuterol is a selective beta-2 adrenergic agonist with minimal nonselective inhibitory effect on airway and vascular smooth muscle. It also facilitates adrenergic neurotransmission, which may help to explain its bronchodilator effect in the intact organism. Tulobuterol does not activate beta-1 adrenoceptors and has no direct positive chronotropic effect. A metabolite of tulobuterol, 4-hydroxytulobuterol, is more active than the parent compound.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently demonstrated the presence of A1 adenosine receptors on canine parietal cells which are involved in the inhibition of histamine-stimulated acid secretion. In order to demonstrate the importance of endogenously generated adenosine on acid secretion we examined the effect of compounds that either increase or decrease the availability of adenosine to the A1 receptor on histamine-stimulated parietal cell aminopyrine (AP) accumulation. Inclusion of 10 microM 8-phenyltheophylline, an adenosine receptor antagonist, with the cells resulted in a 35 +/- 12% and 31 +/- 9% increase in parietal cell AP accumulation at histamine concentrations of 1 microM and 10 microM, respectively. The effect of 8-phenyltheophylline was specific to histamine in that it did not affect carbachol-stimulated AP accumulation or dibutyryl cyclic AMP-stimulated AP accumulation. Inclusion of 1 microM dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine transport, resulted in a 34 +/- 6% and 31 +/- 5% decrease in parietal cell AP accumulation at histamine concentrations of 1 microM and 10 microM, respectively. Again the effect of dipyridamole was specific to histamine in that it did not affect either carbachol- or dibutyryl cyclic AMP-stimulated AP accumulation. The addition of adenosine deaminase, 500 mU/ml, resulted in an enhanced histamine-stimulated AP accumulation at all the histamine concentrations. The effect was specific to histamine because the enzyme had no effect on either carbachol- or dibutyryl cyclic AMP-stimulated AP uptake. Our present data suggest that endogenous adenosine generated by the gastric cells can interact with parietal cell adenosine receptors to modulate acid secretion to histamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When administered s.c. nalmefene HCl caused a dose-dependent tail skin temperature increase, whereas nalmefene glucuronide was ineffective. Nalmefene precipitated brain-mediated morphine withdrawal at doses as low as 10 micrograms/kg, whereas nalmefene glucuronide was ineffective at doses as high as 1 mg/kg. After p.o. administration of the drugs, naloxone HCl and nalmefene HCl caused diarrhea, withdrawal behavior and tail skin temperature responses by 15 min. In contrast, after p.o. administration of the glucuronide conjugate of either narcotic antagonist, diarrhea was delayed for 75 to 203 min. This latency probably reflects the required transit time to the lower gastrointestinal tract inasmuch as direct colonic administration of either nalmefene or nalmefene glucuronide caused diarrhea within 5 to 8 min. Additionally, the magnitude of brain-mediated withdrawal was smaller and its time of occurrence was delayed and compared to the diarrhea response after p.o. administration of the conjugated forms of the narcotic antagonists. Our calculations indicate that about 0.2 to 0.5% of the dose of the narcotic antagonist administered orally as the glucuronide was absorbed systemically. These results indicate that p.o. administration of the glucuronide conjugates of naloxone and nalmefene results in delivery of the narcotic antagonists to the colon. As such these conjugates may be useful in the prevention or relief of constipation caused by opiate use, without interfering with the central analgesic effects of the narcotics.\r"

  ".W": "The striking resistance of norepinephrine contractions of rat splenic strips to antagonism by the selective alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin was examined by Schild analysis. Prazosin was a simple competitive antagonist of contractions to phenylephrine indicating that this tissue possesses alpha-1 adrenoceptors. In contrast, the Schild regression for prazosin, with norepinephrine as the agonist, was nonlinear and had an overall slope of 0.24. These data indicated that norepinephrine activated a prazosin-resistant adrenoceptor in this tissue. As a working hypothesis, it was assumed that the prazosin-resistant receptor was an alpha-2 adrenoceptor; the concomitant addition of yohimbine, in concentrations below those required to block alpha-1 adrenoceptors, converted the atypical Schild regression for prazosin (norepinephrine as agonist) to a linear regression identical with that found for antagonism of phenylephrine responses. Selective alkylation of alpha-1 adrenoceptors with phenoxybenzamine (POB) eliminated responses to phenylephrine but not those to norepinephrine. After POB-alkylation and in the presence of a concentration of prazosin that was sufficient to produce a profound blockade of alpha-1 adrenoceptors, a response to norepinephrine remained. It was determined that the POB/prazosin-resistant response most likely was mediated by a homogeneous population of receptors by the finding that the Schild regressions for both yohimbine and idazoxan were identical with respect to slope and elevation when either norepinephrine or cobefrin were utilized as agonists, i.e., a difference in the regressions for these antagonists would be expected if the two agonists activated a heterogeneous receptor population.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A Ca++-free medium and carbachol, but not nicotine, inhibited [3H]ACh release. Atropine, methylatropine and dexetimide produced concentration-dependent increases in [3H]ACh release to a maximum of about 50% above control. Aprophen and benactyzine produced a maximal response 25 to 35% above control. The selective M1 antagonist pirenzepine had the least effect on [3H]ACh release. Of the nonspecific M1-M2 antagonists studied, benactyzine produced the least amount of [3H]ACh release. The order of potency of the M antagonists in promoting a 15% increase in [3H]ACh release was aprophen greater than benactyzine greater than methylatropine greater than dexetimide greater than pirenzepine greater than atropine.

Adenosine receptor function was subsequently assayed using both ligand binding and adenylate cyclase assays. Binding to A1 receptors was quantitated using [3H]N6-[(R)-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]adenosine, a selective agonist ligand at A1 receptors. Differences in the binding of this ligand and that of [3H]NECA, which binds to A1 and A2 receptors with similar affinities, were used to quantitate A2 receptors. None of the treatments affected A1 receptor function as assessed by both ligand binding and adenylate cyclase assays. A2 receptor binding and A2 receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase were blunted in striatal membranes from NECA- and deoxycoformycin-treated rats but unaffected in striatal membranes from N6-[(R]-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl]adenosine-treated rats. All three pretreatments attenuated D1 dopamine receptor-mediated stimulation of adenylate cyclase in striatal membranes. These results suggest that 1) the A2 adenosine receptor system is susceptible to desensitization and 2) different mechanisms are involved in the NECA- and deoxycoformycin-induced desensitization of A2 adenosine receptor and D1 dopamine receptor systems. It is suggested that the D1 dopamine receptor desensitization is, in fact, due to the tonic stimulation of adenosine A1 receptors.\r"

Rings of tissue from acutely reserpinized animals were incubated with [3H]inositol in the presence of lithium to block IP degradation and desmethylimipramine to block neuronal uptake of norepinephrine. Eighteen days after denervation the potency of norepinephrine in stimulating [3H]IP accumulation was increased 10-fold. The potency of epinephrine was increased only 3.5-fold, and the potency of phenylephrine was not altered significantly. The potency of norepinephrine in control tissues incubated with 0.1 microM desmethylimipramine was unaffected by addition of cocaine to further block neuronal uptake; however, addition of pyrogallol and pargyline to block metabolic degradation increased the potency of norepinephrine in these tissues by 6-fold. Two days after denervation there was a similar 5-fold increase in the potency of norepinephrine. In denervated tissues, the potency of norepinephrine in stimulating [3H]IP accumulation was decreased about 40-fold after receptor inactivation with 1 microM phenoxybenzamine. These results suggest that there is a substantial alpha-1 adrenergic receptor reserve for stimulating [3H]IP accumulation in rat vas deferens which is normally obscured by rapid inactivation of norepinephrine. The increase in the potency of norepinephrine after denervation appears to be due to removal of these inactivation mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "The authors propose a model of pharmacodynamic response that, when integrated with a pharmacokinetic model, allows characterization of the development of functional tolerance. The model may be conceived of in several equivalent ways; one of these sees tolerance as a result of (noncompetitive) antagonism of agonist effect by a hypothetical substance (e.g., metabolite) produced by a first-order process, driven by agonist concentration. Tolerance thus lags behind, and is approximately proportional to, agonist concentrations. Two new parameters quantifying tolerance are introduced: kantO, which describes the elimination kinetics of the antagonist and determines the rate of development and disappearance of tolerance, and Cant50, which determines the magnitude of tolerance that can be achieved. The model was tested in eight volunteers on data produced after three sequences of paired i.v. administrations of nicotine separated by different intervals of time. Blood concentrations of nicotine and heart rate were measured. The proposed tolerance model was fitted to the nicotine data. The estimate of kantO suggests a half-life of development and regression of tolerance of 35 min, and the estimate of Cant50 suggests that tolerance, at its full development, causes an approximately 80% reduction of initial (nontolerant) effect. This model provides a quantitative pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic description of the development of acute tolerance that also carries physiologic meaning. The quantitative information provided by this model may improve understanding of the temporal patterns of drug abuse and complications thereof.\r"

  ".U": "88090590\r", 
  ".W": "In the presence of a stimulus above the center lever, rats were required to complete one of two fixed-ratios (FRs) on the center lever (FR 8 or FR 16). Completion of the ratio turned off the center-lever stimulus and produced a stimulus above each of the two side levers. If the completed ratio was high (e.g., FR 16), a response on the left lever produced a food pellet. If the ratio was low (e.g., FR 8) a response on the right lever produced food. Errors produced a brief timeout. When administered alone, morphine, cyclazocine, pentazocine, dl-N-allylnormetazocine (NANM), d-NANM, I-NANM and phencyclidine each produced dose-related decreases in accuracy and response rate. Ketocyclazocine decreased response rate in a dose-related manner but had little or no effect on accuracy. Naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) shifted to the right by approximately 0.75 log unit the morphine dose-effect curves. This same dose of naltrexone tended to produce greater antagonism of the effects of pentazocine on accuracy than on rate which was shifted by only 0.25 log unit. Naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) produced little or no antagonism of the effects of cyclazocine, whereas naltrexone (1 mg/kg) shifted the dose-effect curves to the right by about 0.25 log unit. Naltrexone (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) shifted the ketocyclazocine dose-effect curves to the right by approximately 0.5 and 1 log unit, respectively. Although variable among subjects, across a range of doses (0.1-10 mg/kg), naltrexone failed to antagonize the effects of dl-NANM, d-NANM, l-NANM and phencyclidine. Rather, in some subjects naltrexone tended to shift the dose-effect curves to the left. Fluphenazine (0.1 mg/kg) also failed to antagonize the effects of d-, l-NANM and phencyclidine. In summary, whereas mu and sigma agonists produce qualitatively similar effects on the performance of a discrimination in the rat, they do so through different mechanisms of action.\r"

  ".W": "Intravenous injection of the alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, clonidine and xylazine, have been previously shown to produce hypoxemia in sheep. To characterize this effect further, clonidine and ST-91, a clonidine analog that does not cross the blood-brain barrier, were injected i.v. in 10 conscious ewes. Although both clonidine (3-15 micrograms/kg) and ST-91 (3-30 micrograms/kg) produced arterial hypoxemia, clonidine was more effective (arterial PO2 was 91 +/- 4 mm Hg after saline, 30 +/- 3 mm Hg after 15 micrograms/kg of clonidine and 43 +/- 6 mm Hg after 30 micrograms/kg of ST-91; mean +/- S.E., P less than .0001). ST-91 increased mean arterial blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner (P less than .0001), whereas clonidine did not affect blood pressure. Clonidine-induced hypoxemia was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist idazoxan (0.01-1 mg/kg, complete inhibition after 1 mg/kg; P less than .0001), the hydrophilic alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist DG-5128 (0.1-10 mg/kg, 62 +/- 7% inhibition after 10 mg/kg; P less than .0005) and by infusion of prostacyclin (0.15-0.5 microgram/kg/min, 57 +/- 7% inhibition after 0.5 micrograms/kg/min; P less than .05). Hypoxemia was not inhibited by the opiate antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg), the alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist prazosin (1 mg/kg) or the prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor ibuprofen (12.5 mg/kg). To characterize pulmonary vascular effects, clonidine was injected i.v. in four anesthetized, mechanically ventilated ewes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that different regimens of footshock elicit either \"opiate\" (naloxone-sensitive) or \"histaminergic\" (cimetidine-sensitive but naloxone-insensitive) analgesic responses. Presently, the nature of these responses was further investigated by characterizing the development of tolerance to these stress paradigms and by assessing the degree of cross-tolerance between these treatments and morphine (MOR) in rats. Daily exposure to the \"opiate\" stress paradigm for 7 days resulted in a significant loss of this form of footshock-induced analgesia (FSIA), but the same exposure to the \"histaminergic\" regimen resulted in no such tolerance. One day later, animals from the \"opiate\"-stressed group exhibited MOR analgesia that was comparable to that in unstressed animals, whereas animals chronically exposed to the \"histaminergic\" paradigm showed highly potentiated responses to MOR. However, when naive animals were made tolerant to MOR, acute \"opiate\" FSIA was significantly attenuated, whereas the \"histaminergic\" analgesia was unaffected. These results, showing one-way cross-tolerance between MOR and \"opiate\" FSIA, are consistent with the hypothesis that opiate FSIA uses a subset of opiate receptors activated by systemic MOR. The one-way cross-sensitization between MOR and \"histaminergic\" analgesia observed presently, taken with previous findings, suggests that opiate-containing and histamine-containing neurons comprise separate endogenous analgesic systems that mutually inhibit each other. The absence of tolerance and opiate cross-tolerance exhibited by the cimetidine-sensitive analgesia suggests that drugs designed to activate this analgesic system should be devoid of such liabilities.\r"

The renal contribution to the metabolism of 1-N was investigated in the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPK). 1-N was metabolized to its sulfate (1-NS) and glucuronide (1-NG) conjugate by the IPK. The renal clearance of 1-N ranged from 5.36 to 6.24 ml/min/kidney and was 80 to 95% of the p-aminohippuric acid clearance by the IPK. This indicated that the renal extraction ratio of 1-N was 0.80 to 0.95, showing an important contribution of renal metabolic clearance to the total clearance. Nonlinear kinetics, due to saturation of the metabolic pathways, was shown at 1-N concentrations higher than 10 microM. 1-NS and 1-NG are both secreted in the urine and perfusate, although the urinary excretion of 1-NS is very small whereas the excretion of 1-NG into the urine is extensive, due to differences in the active secretion and protein binding of both conjugates.\r"

In order to characterize the hepatic uptake mechanism for such bivalent cations in more detail, we studied the uptake of the steroidal muscle relaxant vecuronium in isolated rat hepatocytes. Uptake occurred by both a saturable (Vmax = 181 pmol/min x 10(6) cells, Km = 15 microM) and a nonsaturable process (rate constant = 1.10 pmol/min/10(6) cells/microM). The uptake of vecuronium was reduced by various metabolic inhibitors and by sulfhydryl-blocking agents. The transport system showed temperature dependency with an activation energy of 85 kJ/mol. Sodium replacement by lithium or choline in the extracellular medium had no effect on the uptake of vecuronium. Replacement of sodium chloride by sucrose led to a decrease of the uptake, whereas chloride replacement by bicarbonate or iodide stimulated the vecuronium uptake. These data point to a significant anion-dependency of the uptake system and indicate electroneutral uptake of vecuronium. The uptake of vecuronium was inhibited by a variety of hepatic transport model compounds, including bile acids, uncharged compounds and high molecular weight organic cations. Low molecular weight monovalent cations had no effect on the uptake of vecuronium.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have determined whether in the isolated perfused dog saphenous vein 1) luminal administration of serotonin can result in its accumulation in the adrenergic nerves and 2) endothelium can interfere with the transport of the amine into the vessel wall. Saphenous veins were perfused with medium containing [3H]serotonin, [3H]norepinephrine or [3H]epinephrine; after washout, significant amounts of 3H were detected in the veins. The 3H-accumulation was augmented when the endothelium was removed mechanically; the augmented accumulation was only observed when the [3H]amines reached the tissues from the intimal side. In coronary arteries perfused with [3H]serotonin, similar results were obtained. No increased 3H-accumulation was noted in veins without endothelium perfused in the presence of cocaine. Nerve stimulation of veins labeled with [3H]serotonin caused an augmented release of 3H from the tissues without endothelium. Pargyline augmented the accumulation of [3H]serotonin and [3H]norepinephrine and decreased the difference between tissues with or without endothelium only for norepinephrine. Perfusion of venous segments with platelets, labeled with [3H]serotonin, resulted in a 3H-content which was significantly higher in the veins without endothelium. Our experiments show that serotonin and other amines, applied luminally to perfused blood vessels, can accumulate in the adrenergic nerves and that the endothelium can reduce this accumulation. Serotonin, originating from aggregating platelets, can penetrate the vessel wall much easier at sites of endothelial denudation and this serotonin also can enter the adrenergic nerves.\r"

The aim of this work was to study the effects of norepinephrine, angiotensin II and arg8-vasopressin on intrahepatic portal resistance in isolated perfused livers from normal rats and rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. Livers were perfused at a constant pressure and the measured variable was portal blood flow. Dose-response curves were obtained by cumulative addition of agonists to the perfusate. The three vasoactive agents increased resistance in normal and cirrhotic livers. The maximal amplitude of response was similar in normal and cirrhotic livers. The cirrhotic livers exhibited an increased sensitivity to norepinephrine, a decreased sensitivity to angiotensin II but an unchanged sensitivity to arg8-vasopressin. The shape of the dose-response curve for norepinephrine and arg8-vasopressin, but not for angiotensin II, was modified in cirrhotic livers. We conclude that the cirrhotic liver retains a strong vascular reactivity to vasoactive agents and particularly to norepinephrine.\r"

Both of these agents at concentrations of 100 and 20 microM, respectively, blocked the inotropic effects of ouabain and acetylstrophanthidin (AS) in isolated rabbit atria and papillary muscle preparations. Neither of these agents had any effect of its own on contractile force. Addition of phloretin or cytochalasin-B after the inotropic response to ouabain was fully established did not reverse the effect. The potency of cytochalasin-B was greater in atria than in papillary muscles, 1 microM of cytochalasin caused significant inhibition of the inotropic effect of ouabain in atria without significant effect in papillary muscles. Phloretin but not cytochalasin-B decreased the binding of [3H]ouabain to a semipurified sarcolemmal preparation isolated from canine left ventricular muscle. Neither ouabain nor AS had a substantial positive inotropic effect in atria suspended in substrate-free medium. Substitution of pyruvate (5 mM) for glucose did not fully support their inotropic effect in atria. Papillary muscles behaved differently, in that substrate-free as well as pyruvate media almost fully supported the inotropic effects of ouabain and of low concentrations of AS. Higher concentrations (greater than 250 ng/ml) of As produced a negative inotropic response in substrate-free medium. The possibility that an \"active\" sugar transport system is required for digitalis inotropy is ruled out by the observation that 2-deoxyglucose also prevents the inotropic effect.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In mammalian striatal tissue and cat platelets, [3H]ketanserin labels besides serotonin-S2 receptors nonserotonergic saturable binding sites. The sites have been distinguished and characterized in [3H]ketanserin binding assays by selective inhibition with tetrabenazine (Ki = 4 nM), a monoamine depleting agent. In rats, the nonserotonergic ketanserin sites were enriched in the striatum (KD = 12.4 +/- 0.3 nM, maximal number of binding sites = 53.2 +/- 11.8 fmol/mg of tissue at pH 7.7, 37 degrees C) and nucleus accumbens. The sites were decreased by 65 to 78% after 6-hydroxydopamine lesions, suggesting an association with dopaminergic nerve terminals. In in vitro superfusion experiments using [3H]dopamine, [3H]norepinephrine and [3H]serotonin loaded rat brain tissue and [3H]serotonin loaded human platelets, 5 min superfusion with 10(-6) M ketanserin, tetrabenazine and reserpine caused instantaneously a marked increase in tritium efflux. The effect was attenuated by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, pargyline, in brain slices but not in platelets. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of endogenous catecholamines, serotonin and metabolites in superfusates from striatal slices revealed that stimulation with these drugs provoked mainly release of 3,4-dihydroxybenzeneacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Potencies of a series of ketanserin derivatives, benzoquinolizine derivatives and a variety of drugs affecting neurotransmission were assessed in the in vitro release test using [3H]dopamine loaded striatal slices, and in [3H]ketanserin binding assays to nonserotonergic sites in the striatum and to serotonin-S2 receptors in brain tissue. Activities of drugs in the release test correlated strongly with their binding affinities for nonserotonergic ketanserin sites (rs = 0.83, n = 30, P less than .001). High potency in the latter two tests was confined to few close structural congeners of ketanserin and tetrabenazine. Distinct structural activity relationships for interaction with nonserotonergic ketanserin sites and serotonin-S2 receptors were found. It was concluded that nonserotonergic ketanserin sites mediate release of oxidated metabolites of biogenic amines from nerve endings and of serotonin from platelets. Hence release of biogenic amine metabolites or of cytoplasmic amines is probably not a mere diffusion process but involves specific membranous molecules. Unlike tetrabenazine, ketanserin caused no obvious depletion of central catecholamine and indoleamine stores. Implications of these findings for the mechanism of action of the drugs are discussed.\r"

Drugs combined with PCP to test for antagonism included an alpha-1 (prazosin) and an alpha-2 (yohimbine) adrenergic antagonist, the adenosine receptor agonist, I-phenylisopropyl adenosine, the gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist, imidazole acetic acid, the dopaminergic antagonist, haloperidol, the acylating agent of the PCP receptor, metaphit, and the dopaminergic drugs (+)- and (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine. All test drugs except metaphit were tested in rats trained to discriminate 2.5 mg/kg of PCP from saline. (+)- and (-)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine were additionally tested in rats trained to discriminate 1.0 mg/kg of PCP from saline. Metaphit was only tested in rats which had been trained to discriminate a 1.0-mg/kg PCP dose. None of the test drugs systematically reduced PCP level selection to vehicle levels. Yohimbine and prazosin, however, but not the other test drugs, partially reversed the response rate reducing effects of PCP. Evidence that alpha adrenergic antagonists have some PCP antagonistic effects were confirmed for the response rate effects of PCP, indicating a possible role of adrenergic mediation of these effects.\r"

Isolated canine Purkinje tissue-papillary muscle preparations were studied using standard microelectrode techniques. Tissues were superfused for 10 min with a solution that mimicked ischemia (hypoxia, acidosis, elevated lactate levels and zero substrate). Reperfusion with normal Tyrode's solution was then instituted for 60 min. Next, tissues were equilibrated with amrinone (5.3 X 10(-4) M) or milrinone (2.5 X 10(-4) M) for 15 min and the protocol was repeated with drug in all solutions. Without drug, ischemic conditions resulted in moderate depolarization of Purkinje and muscle tissues. Reperfusion caused a rapid hyperpolarization in Purkinje tissue. This was followed by a phase of mild depolarization associated with enhanced pacemaker activity. All preparations recovered by 45 min of reperfusion. With amrinone or milrinone present, the changes in membrane potential induced by conditions of ischemia and reperfusion were not different from control. However, an early phase of very rapid ectopic activity was seen during reperfusion with amrinone or milrinone. This ectopic activity had a constant cycle length during the pauses in stimulation. However, irregular patterns of spontaneous and driven beats were observed when electrical stimulation was superimposed on the ectopic activity. Amrinone and milrinone also increased pacemaker activity in Purkinje tissue but this occurred later in reperfusion. This study demonstrates that amrinone and milrinone sensitize isolated canine ventricular tissues to the arrhythmogenic effects of reperfusion. The mechanism underlying the arrhythmic activity elicited by the bipyridines is not clear, but may involve re-entry or abnormal automaticity.\r"

  ".W": "Aminoglycosides such as neomycin are commonly prescribed antibiotics; however, there is associated serious damage to the kidney. We examined the effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics on renal protein phosphorylation and found that neomycin selectively inhibited Ca++-activated, phospholipid-dependent phosphorylation of 88-kDa protein in cell lysates of the rabbit kidney. Fifty percent inhibition of phosphorylation of this protein occurred with 5 X 10(-5) to 1 X 10(-4) M neomycin. In living PtK2 cells, neomycin dose-dependently inhibited 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate-induced phosphorylation of 88 K Da protein. This drug also inhibited phosphorylation of exogenous protein catalyzed by protein kinase C, isolated from rabbit kidney in vitro. In contrast, neomycin had little or no inhibitory effect on cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase I, casein kinase II and Ca++-calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. Whereas activity of protein kinase C was inhibited 65% by neomycin (0.1 mM) at pH 5 to 7, inhibition decreases to 33% at pH 8 and to zero at pH 9. The potencies of a series of aminoglycoside antibiotics to inhibit the kinase agreed well with number of ionizable amino groups of compounds (gamma = 0.99) and this also approximates their known nephrotoxic potential; amikacin less than or equal to kanamycin less than gentamycin less than or equal to tobramycin less than neomycin. As aminoglycoside antibiotics present in the kidney after administration of toxicological doses (10(-2) M) will inhibit the effects of protein kinase C, the aminoglycoside antibiotics-induced nephrotoxicity is discussed in relation to inhibition of intracellular protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "The hypothesis that a novel drug binding site linked to a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-regulated chloride ionophore mediates the excitatory effects of the atypical benzodiazepine (BZ) Ro5 4864 is further evaluated in the present study. Dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam to the central BZ receptor in rat cerebral cortex by the cage convulsant t-butylbicyclophosphorotionate (TBPS) is modulated by Ro5 4864 and the isoquinoline PK 11195 in a manner consistent with their reported pro/anticonvulsant effects. The ability of Ro5 4864 to enhance the binding of [35S]TBPS to a GABA-regulated chloride ionophore in rat cortex is unchanged after the irreversible labeling of the central BZ receptor by the photoaffinity label Ro15 4513. Together, these observations further suggest that 1) the effect of Ro5 4864 on [35S]TBPS is not mediated by the central BZ receptor and 2) the Ro5 4864 binding site is allosterically coupled to the GABA/BZ receptor-chloride ionophore complex in rat cerebral cortex. Anatomical localization of Ro5 4864-stimulated [35S]TBPS binding in rat brain by autoradiography reveals a distribution of chloride ionophore-coupled Ro5 4864 sites which is in many instances similar to that of the GABA/BZ receptor-chloride ionophore complex. These studies lend additional support to the postulate that this drug binding site represents an additional locus for the regulation of GABAergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system.\r"

The duration of fentanyl-induced inhibition was dose-related between 0.8 and 8.0 micrograms/kg i.v. Pretreatment with the opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone HCl (250 micrograms/kg i.v.), antagonized completely fentanyl's effect on VP rhythm. Results similar to those obtained with fentanyl were observed after the bilateral stimulation of opiate receptors in the dorsolateral tegmental-subceruleus region of the pons (DLT-SC region) with D-Ala2-Met5-enkephalinamide (DAMA) microinjections. These inhibitory effects were dose-related and significant between 1.0 and 100.0 ng/site. DAMA in the DLT-SC did not alter basal cardiorespiratory parameters. The systemic and local administration of naloxone reversed rapidly the VP effects elicited by DAMA in the DLT-SC region. Naloxone alone, administered either i.v. or locally in the DLT-SC region, increased the frequency of spontaneous reflex increases in VP. Moreover, pretreatment of the DLT-SC region with naloxone microinjections significantly (55% reduction) decreased the duration of fentanyl (8.0 micrograms/kg i.v.)-induced inhibition of VP rhythm. Neurons in DLT-SC region whose discharge increased just before and throughout spontaneous increases in VP (vesical contraction-related units), were inhibited rapidly and completely by the systemic administration of fentanyl.

  ".W": "The present experiments compared the ability of a new potential antipsychotic drug, BMY 14802 (alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine- butanol), to alter the electrophysiological activity of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons in the rat substantia nigra (A9) and ventral tegmental area (A10). Intravenous administration of BMY 14802 reversed the rate-suppressant effects of the DA agonist apomorphine on both A9 and A10 DA neurons; however, this reversal occurred at significantly lower doses in A10 than in A9. These effects of BMY 14802 appeared not to be mediated by DA receptors because, unlike the established antipsychotic drugs haloperidol and clozapine, BMY 14802 pretreatment failed to block apomorphine-induced suppression of A10 DA cells. Repeated s.c. administration (28 days) of BMY 14802 (2.5-10.0 mg/kg) reduced the number of spontaneously active A10 DA cells recorded per electrode track without affecting the number of A9 DA cells. This inactivation of A10 DA neurons was only partially reversed by the administration of apomorphine. Thus, it is uncertain as to whether this effect was produced by depolarization block as occurs during repeated administration of known antipsychotic drugs. These findings indicate that BMY 14802 influences DA neurotransmission by a nondopaminergic (perhaps sigma opioid) mechanism. The more potent effect of BMY 14802 on A10 DA neurons suggests that this novel compound may exert antipsychotic effects without producing significant extrapyramidal side effects.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of ketamine and morphine on pain perception and catalepsy were compared in rats. Analgesia, as measured by the latency to withdrawal of the tail from a 55 degrees C water bath (tail-flick latency difference, TFLD), was produced by both ketamine and morphine, but at widely different doses, and in each case the effect was reversed by naloxone. Catalepsy, measured by the duration of loss of righting reflex (DLRR) in catatonic animals, was induced by larger doses of both ketamine and morphine and in each case was reduced by a larger dose of naloxone. DLRR and TFLD tolerance developed rapidly and with a similar time course after daily doses of ketamine or morphine. Rats tolerant to the DLRR effect of ketamine showed cross-tolerance to morphine. Rats tolerant to the DLRR effect of morphine did not show cross-tolerance to ketamine when administered the following day; instead, these rats showed potentiation of the ketamine-induced DLRR. The degree of potentiation noted 24 hr after a single or multiple daily doses of 45 mg/kg of morphine is the same as that seen when 2 mg/kg of morphine is given simultaneously with ketamine. The residual brain level of morphine 24 hr after 45 mg/kg is similar to the level 1 hr after a 2-mg/kg dose. The augmented ketamine response in morphine-tolerant rats is postulated to be a result of residual morphine still present in the brain 24 hr after the last DLRR-inducing dose of morphine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Cholecystokinin (CCK)-8S was found both to decrease basal and to antagonize harmaline-dependent increases in cerebellar cyclic GMP (cGMP) in the mouse. These actions were not blocked by parenteral pretreatment with naloxone, proglumide or CR-1409, indicating a central-type CCK receptor activation with no involvement of opioid systems. These data were further confirmed by the greater potency (200x) of intraventricular relative to s.c. doses for CCK-8S. The intraventricular administration of CCK-4, t.BOC.CCK-4 and CCK-8US also resulted in decreased cerebellar cGMP levels, consistent with a central-type CCK receptor action. Direct administration of CCK-8S into the cerebellum failed to alter either basal or harmaline-stimulated cerebellar cGMP levels, indicating that the actions of this peptide on cerebellar cGMP are not directly at the level of the cerebellum. The convulsants, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol, elevated cerebellar cGMP with no antagonism by pretreatment with s.c. CCK-8S. In marked contrast, the increases in cerebellar cGMP induced by treatment with amphetamine, apomorphine, DN 1417, oxotremorine and harmaline were all antagonized by pretreatment with s.c. CCK-8S. These data are consistent with CCK receptor involvement in the regulation of climbing and mossy fiber input to the cerebellum. These actions apparently involve the central-type CCK receptor that resides outside of the cerebellum proper. The exact site(s) of action for CCK-8S remain(s) to be defined.\r"

Using osmotic minipumps and a new Y-catheter technique, we show that chronic intrathecal (i.t.) infusion of morphine (2, 6 or 20 nmol/microliter/hr) or ST-91 (3, 10 or 30 nmol/microliter/hr) in rats produces a dose-dependent increase in hot-plate latency 1 day after pump implant. By 4 to 5 days after initiation of chronic infusion of either drug, hot-plate latencies do not differ from saline-infused controls. Rats rendered tolerant to one of the three chronic i.t. morphine doses (2, 6 or 20 nmol/microliter/hr) and tested at 7 days after initiation of infusion with a bolus i.t. dose of morphine, show a dose-dependent rightward shift in hot-plate dose-response curves. The two lower doses of chronic i.t. infusions of morphine produce parallel shifts of the subsequent i.t. administered morphine dose-response curves, but the highest chronic i.t. dose of morphine (20 nmol/microliter/hr) produces a significantly greater slope of the subsequent i.t. administered morphine dose-response curve. Animals exposed to chronic i.t. infusion of one of three doses of ST-91 (3, 10 or 30 nmol/microliter/hr) display a parallel, dose-dependent rightward shift to a subsequent bolus i.t. injection of ST-91.

  ".U": "88090621\r", 
  ".W": "To assimilate information about the relative efficacies and affinities of the peptidoleukotrienes, the ability of the beta adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol to antagonize functionally contractions produced by leukotrienes (LT)C4, LTD4 and LTE4 was examined in the guinea pig trachea. There was a marked gradation in the sensitivity of LT-induced responses to antagonism by pretreatment with salbutamol (0.01-1.0 microM): LTC4 less than LTD4 less than LTE4. These data suggest marked differences in the receptor reserve for the LTs. However, this postulate is not supported by the finding that the magnitude of the ratio for the estimated dissociation constant, KA, and EC50 values, which provides an indirect measure of the relative receptor reserve, were similar: LTC4 = 4.50, LTD4 = 10.54 and LTE4 = 3.18. Substantial differences were apparent in the estimated KA values: LTC4 = 2.88 nM, LTD4 = 11.8 and LTE4 = 46.4 nM. In the presence of a maximally effective concentration of LTE4 (1 or 10 microM), addition of LTD4 (1 or 10 microM) produced further contraction of the tissue whereas the reverse was not the case. Furthermore, in the presence of salbutamol (70 nM), LTE4 (0.1 microM) produced a 3.6-fold rightward shift in LTD4 concentration-response curves with no effect on the maximum contractile response; a pKB of 7.42 was calculated for LTE4. The results suggest that the large differences in the ability of pretreatment with salbutamol to inhibit contractions produced by LTC4, LTD4 or LTE4 are not attributable solely to corresponding differences in receptor reserve for the individual LTs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Diltiazem inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation, tyramine and norepinephrine suggesting that responses to both nerve-released and exogenous norepinephrine are dependent in part on an extracellular source of calcium. The calcium entry antagonist inhibited vasoconstrictor responses to alpha 1 and to alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists over a wide range of concentration. Diltiazem also inhibited mesenteric vasoconstrictor responses to angiotensin II, vasopressin, prostaglandin F2 alpha and KCl. The inhibitor effects of diltiazem on vasoconstrictor responses to nerve stimulation and the pressor agents were reversible, and all responses returned to control value 30 to 45 min after the infusion of the calcium entry antagonist. The present data suggest that the inhibitory effects of diltiazem on responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation are postjunctional in nature, as responses to nerve-released and exogenous norepinephrine and nonadrenergic pressor agents are reduced to a similar extent. The present results suggest that vasoconstrictor responses to neuronally released and exogenous norepinephrine, as well as agents which activate membrane receptors or depolarize vascular smooth muscle in the feline mesenteric vascular bed, are dependent in part on an extracellular source of calcium. The inhibitory effects of diltiazem on vasoconstrictor responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation and pressor hormones may be relevant to the antihypertensive actions of this calcium entry antagonist.\r"

In addition to the toxication pathway metabolites, which consist of AA-GS and its hydrolysis products (AA-cysteinylglycine, AA-cysteine and AA-mercapturate), detoxication pathway metabolites, such as AA-glucuronide and AA-sulfate, are also formed. In order to evaluate the role of these opposing pathways in the reported species variations in susceptibility to AA-induced liver injury, AA was administered to hamsters and mice, species which are susceptible to AA-induced liver injury, and to rats, rabbits and guinea pigs, species which are relatively resistant to AA-induced liver injury, and the biliary and urinary excretion of AA metabolites were measured simultaneously for 2 hr after administration of AA (1 mmol/kg i.v.). The AA-susceptible species excreted 27 to 42% of the dose as toxication pathway metabolites, whereas the resistant species excreted only 5 to 7% of the dose as toxication pathway metabolites. Most of the toxication pathway metabolites appeared in bile, where their composition reflected hepatic gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity; hamsters and mice (low gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity) excreted mainly AA-GS, whereas bile from rabbits and guinea pigs (high gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity) contained significant amounts of AA-GS hydrolysis products. Thus, the biliary excretion of AA-GS and its hydrolysis products may be used as an index of toxic activation of AA. The excretion of the detoxication pathway metabolites (AA-glucuronide and AA-sulfate) was 74, 62, 41, 27 and 12% of the dose in guinea pigs, rats, mice, rabbits and hamsters respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Eighty-seven percent of the traditional students felt that HPM students had ability equal to that of the average medical student (that is, neither more nor less ability), but 41 percent felt that the HPM students were less mature than the average class member. The traditional students felt the HPM students were required to follow a rigid collegiate curriculum (76 percent) and had an inadequate nonscience background (68 percent) and that the HPM would negatively affect both the future professional competence of HPM participants (59 percent) and the medical profession (34 percent). A larger percentage of the HPM than the traditional students (63 versus 48 percent) reported earning more than a minor in nonscience subjects, and fewer HPM than traditional students (9 versus 36 percent) felt that pressure to maintain a high grade-point average limited their selection of college courses. The HPM students felt that they were well prepared for medical school academically (82 percent) and emotionally (91 percent). The HPM students excelled academically in college and in the preclinical curriculum.\r"

Furthermore, the findings suggest that greater availability of information from medical professionals was related to higher levels of overall satisfaction with the residency match. While no evidence is presented that demonstrates that medical school faculty members and administrators were unwilling to devote attention to any particular group of students, the data suggest that these professionals provided information regarding the residency selection process more often to medical students at high-prestige schools, students who chose high-prestige specialties, and students who perceived themselves as having high class rank than to other students. Also, students in publicly supported schools felt the cost of travel for interviews to be more burdensome than did the students in private schools.\r"

The present authors tested the hypothesis that a potential source of psychoactive drugs for the physician trainees and other health professionals is prescription writing by house officers. Furthermore, the hypothesis was advanced that house officers may write significant numbers of psychoactive prescriptions for their family members and friends. Of 565 house officers at a medical center, 339 responded to a questionnaire designed to determine the number of prescriptions each had written for nonpatients in the previous eight months for several categories of psychoactive drugs. The largest number of such prescriptions was written for family members and friends, and the second largest number was for fellow house officers. Narcotics were the most frequently prescribed psychoactive drugs. When compared with their representation in the sample, first-year residents and residents in surgery and surgical subspecialties wrote significantly more psychoactive drug prescriptions than other residents. Implications of these findings for residents are discussed.\r"

Prerotation and postrotation measurement of the students' attitudes documented a significantly (p less than .003) more favorable attitude toward house calls after completion of the curriculum. The students further indicated that they were more likely after the curriculum than before it to provide house calls as part of their future medical practice. The students' evaluation of the curriculum provided information on the relative effectiveness of teaching strategies used in the curriculum and documented the success of the curriculum in transmitting knowledge about the homebound elderly.\r"

The first six graduating classes (1981 through 1986) of the combined six-year curriculum contained 81 students. These students completed two years of undergraduate education at Gannon University, Erie, Pennsylvania, and four years at Hahnemann University School of Medicine. The students were required to complete the clinical rotations of their final year of medical school in Erie, and one of the rotations had to be family practice. Of the 81 combined-program graduates, 24 (29.6 percent) initially selected family practice residencies, while only 5.2 percent of the regular admission Hahnemann students selected family practice. Of these 24 graduates, 13 completed family practice residencies, and six of those chose to practice in northwest Pennsylvania. Nine graduates remained in family practice training.\r"

In the control kidneys peritubular membrane potential (EMperi) and intracellular potassium activity (aKi) were -70.8 +/- 7.0 mV and 81.2 +/- 22.0 mEq/liter (mean +/- SD), respectively. In the CUUO kidneys both EMperi and aKi were progressively reduced with the duration of obstruction. However, in all tubules aKi values were still above the electrochemical equilibrium. In the three days' CUUO kidneys EMperi and aKi were -51.5 +/- 11.7 mV and 53.8 +/- 22.8 mEq/liter, respectively. Rate of fluid absorption (JVL;nl./sec. mm.) across the proximal tubular epithelium from Ringer solution in the control and three days' CUUO kidneys was 0.029 and 0.0065 respectively. In the CUUO kidneys there were wide variations in JVL and EMperi, but there was a clear correlation between these two variables. JVL from choline chloride solution was negligible in both control and CUUO kidneys. From above results, it was suggested that the proximal tubular reabsorption primarily depending on the Na+-K+ pump might be reduced but still working in the CUUO kidney, and thus the proximal tubular reabsorption might take part in preservation of glomerular filtration during the obstruction.\r"

This study was designed to characterize the non-neuromuscular component of the urethral pressure profile (UPP) by quantitating the relative contributions of its vascular and non-vascular determinants in four female baboons. Following minimization of the smooth muscle and striated muscle determinants (the neuromuscular component) with halothane and pancuronium bromide, UPPs were performed before and after aortic occlusion. It is concluded that vascular and non-vascular factors contribute nearly equally to the non-neuromuscularly generated portion of intraluminal urethral pressure.\r"

Bilateral nephrostomy tubes were inserted in six pigs through a subcostal (flank) retroperitoneal approach. One week later, antegrade pyelograms and renal scans with hippuran I-131 were obtained. The left kidney was then infused weekly for six weeks with two ampules of BCG (Tice strain) dissolved in 75 cc of saline. The right kidney, serving as a control, was infused concomitantly with 75 cc of saline. On week 7, bilateral antegrade pyelograms and renal scans were repeated. Two pigs were sacrificed at four, eight and 12 weeks after completion of BCG therapy. In all pigs, antegrade pyelograms of the left kidney before BCG instillation were identical to those obtained after completion of treatment and to those of the saline infused kidneys. The isotope renal scan in five pigs showed no significant change in image appearance or relative renal plasma flow in the pre-treatment and post-treatment images. In one pig, there was a decrease in the relative clearance of hippuran in the saline infused kidney. In this kidney, an upper pole abscess was found. Microscopic examination of the renal cortex, medulla, pelvis and ureter of the BCG infused kidneys was normal and identical to the saline infused kidneys. The urothelium was intact and no inflammatory changes were noted in the renal cortex or medulla. These results show that direct infusion of BCG into the renal collecting system has no adverse effect on the structure and function of pig kidneys when followed one to three months after treatment.\r"

The role of the perineal muscles in the erectile process, especially in changes in intracavernous pressure, is increasingly being studied on the hypothesis that perineal muscular contractions are essential to full penile rigidity. In a previous investigation we studied the correlation between voluntary perineal muscle contractions and intracavernous pressure during artificially induced erections. The purpose of the current study was to examine whether under normal conditions of nocturnal erection a similar relationship exists between the electromyographic activities of perineal muscles and changes in penile rigidity. Nocturnal penile recordings were made of seven volunteers with psychogenic erectile dysfunctions. During nocturnal erections simultaneous computerized recordings were made of penile tumescence, penile rigidity, and electromyographic activities of perineal muscles. The peaks for the three variables were reached simultaneously. The results of this study suggest the existence of two different physiologic phases: a vascular phase and a muscular phase. Furthermore, in cases of dysfunctions, specific diagnostic assessment and therapeutic management will be required for both penile tumescence and penile rigidity.\r"

Animals underwent urography at four weeks and were sacrificed at six weeks. Mild hydronephrosis was noted in eight instances, essentially unrelated to specific material. Silicone, C-flex and polyurethane stents caused a similar, mild degree of ureteral edema, but ureters stented with Silitek demonstrated fairly marked edema. Epithelial ulceration and erosion, often severe, occurred with all polyurethane stents, and rarely with the three other materials. All materials differed statistically from controls, and C-flex caused less reaction overall than polyurethane, indicating differences in biocompatibility of the various materials which may be relevant to their use in patients undergoing long-term ureteral stenting. In practical terms, these suggest that certain materials, notably silicone and C-flex, are more suitable for ureteral stenting than others.\r"

  ".W": "The Constant Composition (CC) kinetics method has been used for studying the mineralization of calcium oxalate monohydrate (COM) at sustained supersaturations in the presence of pre-bladder urine and macromolecules isolated from normal urine and kidney and bladder stones. The method is especially sensitive for investigating the inhibitory activities of these urinary macromolecular components (UMMC) and matrix macromolecular components (MMMC) with a coefficient of variation in growth rate of approximately 2%. Significant COM mineral inhibition was observed in a wide molecular weight region of urine components. Urine removed directly from the kidney showed appreciable inhibitory activity towards COM crystallization. Normal urinary proteins and the dissolved precipitate resulting from urine centrifugation were fractionated by gel filtration. The resulting solutions were mostly COM mineralization inhibitors. Electrodialysis was utilized to isolate the MMMC (greater than 7000 d) of renal and bladder calculi. While these solutions inhibited COM crystallization, they were also found to be calcium binders as measured by the calcium electrode.\r"

  ".W": "Bowel perforation and damage to surrounding organs is probably the most significant risk with the use of Nd-YAG laser in the bladder. To prevent this unwanted damage, a nomogram dosimetry scale was developed by delivering different settings of laser energy via a cystoscope to 25 female pigs. One week following treatment, exploratory laparotomy and cystectomy were performed. Microscopic analysis of the depth of laser irradiation was accomplished. From this study it was learned that, although the greater the energy delivered, the deeper the tissue damage, this is not uniform. Pulsed energy produced a deeper effect than continuous energy. The use of 30 watts of either pulsed or continuous energy for no longer than 15 seconds (450 joules) or 10 watts of either form of energy for less than 30 seconds (300 joules) did not produce bowel perforation. Other different combinations of high number of watts or pulses translated into transmural necrosis of the bladder with or without perforation and with or without bowel injury. Other factors such as density, thickness, color and temperature of tissue, type and wave length of laser and optimal focusing played a significant role in the final outcome. Useful information for human clinical use may be extrapolated from this experimental model.\r"

The study animals were administered three mg./kg. dihematoporphyrin ether (Photofrin II) intravenously followed 48 hours later by open cystotomy. One ureter was irradiated with 42 joules of 630 nm. light delivered by a 660 micron diameter optical fiber modified for cylindrical light distribution. Intravenous urography was performed both at three days and six weeks post PDT. Hydroureteronephrosis was revealed in one treated ureter and one untreated ureter. Mild dilatation of the ureter was noted by urography in another treated ureter and in one ureter that did not undergo light irradiation; no distal obstruction was revealed in either case by proximal infusion of saline or by histopathology. Nine of the 10 treated ureters were found to have either no abnormal pathology or only minimal lymphocytic infiltration. In this study, the normal ureter was shown to tolerate photodynamic therapy at energy densities equivalent to those used to effect tumor regression and the feasibility of using a cylindrical optical fiber for treatment of ureteral malignancies was confirmed.\r"

Metachronous involvement of the contralateral kidney has not been noted in any of our patients who underwent nephrectomy for unilateral involvement, nor has there been progression of the contralateral lesion in 3 patients with bilateral disease without tuberous sclerosis during a followup of about 6 years. Furthermore, we have not noted progression of lesions in the 11 patients under observation for a mean followup of almost 3 years. We recommend elective exploration and a renal preserving operation when possible, not only for patients with pain and hemorrhage but also for the complex multiple lesions occasionally seen in patients who do not have tuberous sclerosis. Lesions associated with tuberous sclerosis require surgical intervention only when they become symptomatic or enlarge silently.\r"

  ".W": "Removal of a large extension of renal cell carcinoma into the inferior vena cava can be a difficult operation. Circulatory arrest is an operative technique that recently has been used to assist in resection of tumors that extend into the vena cava above the level of the hepatic veins. At our clinic 18 patients were operated on with the intent of using circulatory arrest during radical nephrectomy and inferior vena caval thrombectomy. Of the 18 patients 13 ultimately underwent this procedure, since the remaining 5 had unresectable tumors. One patient died intraoperatively of an adverse reaction to protamine after technically successful removal of the tumor and thrombus. Resection was successful in 12 patients and 9 remained free of disease with short followup. We believe that the addition of circulatory arrest during resection of a large inferior vena caval thrombus allows for an opportunity to resect the tumor in a controlled situation that reduces the potential for sudden massive blood loss or a major vascular injury, and ultimately makes the operation safer.\r"

Of the stones irrigated with saline 76 per cent were returned to the pelvis along with 60 per cent of the lidocaine group and 48 per cent of the surgical lubricant treated stones. There was no statistical significance among the 3 groups. The success rates for upper, mid and lower ureteral stones were 80, 54 and 30 per cent, respectively. Of stones 0.5 cm. or less and between 0.6 and 1.0 cm. 77 and 72 per cent, respectively, were manipulated successfully but only 38 per cent of the stones larger than 1.0 cm. could be dislodged. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was successful in treating pelvic and ureteral stones, although higher kilovolt settings and additional shocks were necessary to fragment the ureteral stones completely. Percutaneous nephrostomy or ureteral meatotomy was required in 10 per cent of the patients with impacted ureteral stones following in situ extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy but in only 4 per cent of the patients with stones successfully returned to the pelvis. Of the ureteral stones 17 per cent were treated with repeat extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. No patient with pelvic stones required repeat treatment. Retrograde manipulation of ureteral stones is an effective adjunctive procedure before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.\r"

A spherical pouch, the neobladder, is fashioned and anastomosed to the urethra. The ureters are implanted according to the method of Le Duc and Camey. Videourodynamic studies during various postoperative phases demonstrate this neobladder to be a urinary reservoir with a capacity approximating that of a normal bladder, good compliance during filling by maintaining pressure lower than 30 cm. water and no reflux. Of the 11 patients with the neobladder 8 are completely dry day and night, while 3 have grade I stress incontinence. All 11 patients had recognizable sensations of bladder distension closely simulating those of normal bladders. The use of this ileal neobladder in male patients undergoing radical cystectomy offers an alternative free of a stoma to urinary diversion, resulting in a highly compliant, low pressure bladder.\r"

The modifications have served to improve the ease of operation and to increase further the reliability as demonstrated by our progressive decrease in the incidence of mechanical failures. From May 1983 to November 1986 we implanted 137 Mentor inflatable penile prostheses. Our over-all mechanical failure rate was 7.3 per cent.

Small stage A carcinomas commonly invaded the anterior fibromuscular stroma and benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules, features that were uncommon even in large stage B tumors. Stage A cancers often appeared to arise within benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules and had a distinctive histological appearance. Even when large, stage A carcinomas tended not to spread close to the rectal surface of the gland. Stages A and B cancers spanned a roughly comparable volume range, and both showed progressive dedifferentiation with increasing volume. It is proposed that stages A and B cancers are biologically similar malignancies, distinguished only by their site of origin. Prognosis for patients with stage A carcinoma probably is closely related to tumor volume and dedifferentiation, features that are not reliably estimated in tissue samples removed at operation for benign prostatic hyperplasia.\r"

Bacteriuria was documented in 29 of the 74 patients (39 per cent). There was a significant difference between the attack rates, with 11 of 41 patients (27 per cent) in the test group and 18 of 33 (55 per cent) in the control group having bacteriuria (p equals 0.02) after a median time to bacteriuria of 36 and 8 days, respectively (p equals 0.01). Urethral meatal colonization was implicated as the source of bladder bacteriuria in 12 of 18 patients (67 per cent) in the control group and 5 of 11 (45 per cent) in the test group. Trichloroisocyanuric acid significantly reduced drainage bag contamination but bag contamination with the same microorganism responsible for bacteriuria preceded infection in only 2 of the 29 patients (7 per cent), 1 in each group. Patients who received systemic antimicrobial agents acquired bacteriuria less frequently than those who did not. The apparent protective effect of systemic antimicrobials was strongest during the first 4 days of catheterization. The data indicate that episodes of bacteriuria arising from the urethral meatus are common among catheterized patients and that the antimicrobial catheter is effective in reducing the incidence of catheter-associated bacteriuria.\r"

In contrast, in only 10 per cent of the patients treated prophylactically with clean intermittent catheterization did deterioration occur. We conclude that when bladder sphincter incoordination is diagnosed in children with myelomeningocele they are at a high risk for the development of future urinary tract injury. The prophylactic use of clean intermittent catheterization can actually prevent this deterioration and its use in this manner is recommended.\r"

  ".W": "Neointimal fibromuscular hyperplasia (NFH) in vein grafts and perianastomotic zones of vascular prostheses has been attributed to the effects of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) released by platelets interacting with bypass conduits. But inhibition of platelet aggregation often fails to prevent NFH, and recurrent growth of intact, platelet-free endothelium over perianastomotic areas where NFH occurs is inconsistent with the concept of sustained PDGF release from platelets causing NFH progression at late times after surgical procedures. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) and human umbilical vein ECs have been shown to release a PDGF-like molecule. We report that confluent cultured fourth passage adult human saphenous vein ECs (AHSVECs) grown in the presence of heparin (100 micrograms/ml) and retina-derived growth factor (RDGF) studied by Northern blotting transcribed a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of 3.9 kb, strongly hybridizing to PDGF B chain probes, and two species of 2.0 and 2.6 kb hybridizing to PDGF A chain probes. Withdrawal of RDGF and heparin from these cultures for 48 hours before mRNA extraction amplified the scanning densitometric mRNA signal per cell by 8.0 +/- 7.6 fold (mean +/- SD) (N = 4 cultures) for B chain mRNA and 5.2 +/- 3.6 fold (N = 3 cultures) for A chain mRNA. In addition, AHSVEC cultures released a PDGF-like substance, because 50% vol/vol AHSVEC-conditioned serum-free medium increased tritiated thymidine uptake elevenfold in PDGF receptor-bearing 3T3 cells whereas an excess (50 micrograms/ml) of nonspecific goat anti-human-PDGF antibody significantly reduced this increase by a mean of 30% to 7.0 +/- 3.4 fold (N = 6 trials, p less than 0.001). Flow cytometry determined AHSVEC cultures to be proliferating with a mean of 6.2% +/- 1.9% (N = 3 culture lines) of ECs in S phase even at confluence when deprived of EC mitogens for 48 hours. Adult human ECs, which proliferate on bypass conduits and host vessels after perioperative injury, may play a role in causing NFH by stimulating proliferation of adjacent smooth muscle cells. Prevention of NFH may require not only antiplatelet agents but also ways to prevent EC release of smooth muscle cell mitogens in response to perioperative EC injury.\r"

  ".W": "Marine lipids containing omega-3 fatty acids (chiefly, eicosapentanoic acid [EPA] and docosahexanoic acid [DHA]) may inhibit the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, but the mechanisms responsible for this putative beneficial effect are unknown. We investigated the effects of EPA and DHA in a canine model of accelerated vein graft arteriosclerosis during a 3-month period. Twenty-five dogs were divided into three dietary groups: group I (control), group II (2.5% cholesterol), and group III (2.5% cholesterol plus 2 gm EPA/day [as MaxEPA]). The effects of EPA on vein graft intimal thickening, platelet and vascular prostaglandin metabolism, lipid and lipoprotein receptor metabolism, and hematologic parameters were assessed. Cholesterol feeding caused a significant 54% increase in graft intimal thickness compared with control animals (124.9 +/- 50.4 vs 81.2 +/- 32.4 micron; p = 0.013), which was prevented by supplementation with EPA in group III (56.9 +/- 30.0 micron; p = 0.001 vs group II). Intimal thickness in group III was not significantly different from that of control. EPA supplementation was also associated with a 38% decline in serum thromboxane levels from 457.0 +/- 129.3 pg/0.1 ml in group II to 283.5 +/- 96.9 pg/0.1 ml in group III (p = 0.007). The alterations in lipoprotein metabolism associated with cholesterol feeding were not affected by EPA: in both groups II and III, serum cholesterol and high-density lipoproteins and liver cholesterol content were elevated and hepatic low-density lipoproteins (LDL) receptor content was reduced. There were no differences between the three groups in terms of vein graft or native vessel prostacyclin production, hematocrit, platelet count, or coagulation parameters. In this canine model, dietary supplementation with marine omega-3 fatty acids reduced the extent and magnitude of accelerated vein graft intimal thickening induced by hypercholesterolemia; moreover, this beneficial effect was associated with lower serum thromboxane production and appeared to be independent of alterations in lipoprotein metabolism or LDL receptor density.\r"

Three preparations were studied: (1) removal of only the endothelial cells, accomplished by flow surface drying and balloon catheter denudation, (2) removal of the superficial portion of the nonvasal media, accomplished by endarterectomy to a depth of 200 to 300 micron, and (3) removal of the entire inner (nonvasal) media, accomplished by endarterectomy to a depth of 500 to 600 micron to reach the outer (vasal) media. A total of 44 specimens were studied after implantation periods of 7, 14, 28, and 56 days. In all cases endothelial cell ingrowth from the host aorta into the test specimen was prevented by the impervious graft sleeves. In the deep endarterectomy group there were scattered areas of reendothelialization at 1 week, extensive reendothelialization at 2 weeks, almost complete reendothelialization at 4 weeks, and confluence by 8 weeks. However, in the superficial endarterectomy group scanning electron microscopy showed scattered areas of factor VIII/von Willebrand factor (FVIII/vWF)-negative, endothelial-like cells at 4 weeks, whereas at 8 weeks most of the surface was covered by endothelial cells identified by FVIII/vWF. In those specimens subjected to balloon catheter removal of endothelial cells only, reendothelialization was not seen, even at 8 weeks.\r"

This study was designed to determine whether cyclic tensional deformation of ECs in vitro induces different morphologic or protein synthetic responses. ECs from passages 6 through 9 were seeded in 35 mm2 well silicone rubber plates at 2 x 10(5) cells/well and allowed to attach for 24 hours. The experimental group was placed in a vacuum-operated stress-providing device that exerted an elongation of 24% at maximum downward deflection of the culture plate bottom and was subjected to repetitive cycles of 10 seconds of 24% maximum elongation and 10 seconds of relaxation for 5 days. The control group was subjected to similar incubation conditions but without stretch. 35S-methionine (500 muCi/well) was added to the plates 24 hours before harvesting, and two-dimensional gels of the harvested lysates (isoelectric focusing with pH 3 to 10 ampholytes followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12.5% gels) were performed and the labeled proteins visualized by autoradiography. The data indicate that there is a differential synthesis of proteins, with synthesis of some proteins decreased or ablated whereas other proteins were increased in response to cyclic mechanical tension. The actin filament organization was evaluated after staining with rhodamine phalloidin, a fluorescent F-actin probe. The ECs subjected to tension had a more polygonal shape and demonstrated pseudopods and actin stress fibers, whereas ECs cultured under static conditions were more rounded and did not express actin stress cables.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Therefore we studied the effect of cigarette smoke, nicotine, and carbon monoxide on the permeability of the canine arterial wall to 125I-labeled fibrinogen. The results show that inhaled cigarette smoke significantly and rapidly increases the permeability of the arterial wall to fibrinogen and that this effect can be produced with carbon monoxide alone but not with intravenous nicotine.\r"

This study aimed to determine whether drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) done before aortic cross-clamping could decrease the incidence of paraplegia in dogs. The descending thoracic aorta was clamped distal to the left subclavian artery for either 40 minutes (group I) or 60 minutes (group II). All control animals in group I (10) and group II (10) showed evidence of spinal cord injury with paraparesis or paraplegia. In contrast, 9 of 10 animals (90%) in group I and 7 of 10 animals (70%) in group II that had CSF drainage before aortic cross-clamping were neurologically normal (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Aortic pressure distal to the aortic cross clamp was the same in all groups; however, spinal cord perfusion pressure (distal aortic pressure minus CSF pressure) was significantly higher in neurologically normal animals (34 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 15) compared with those with paraparesis (26 +/- 4 mm Hg, n = 8) or paraplegia (19 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 8) (r = 0.871, p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that drainage of CSF before thoracic aortic occlusion significantly increases spinal cord perfusion pressure and decreases the incidence of paraplegia. Limited early clinical experience suggests that CSF drainage may be a useful adjunct to prevent paraplegia in patients who are having repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms.\r"

  ".W": "Spinal cord monitoring during thoracic aneurysmectomy by somatosensory evoked potentials has been criticized for its failure to measure anterior (motor) spinal cord function. We have developed a clinically applicable, noninvasive technique for intraoperative monitoring of motor evoked potentials (MEP), which allows direct functional assessment of spinal cord motor tracts during thoracic aortic occlusion. Twelve dogs underwent continuous intraoperative monitoring of MEP before, during, and after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. Motor tract response to noninvasive cord stimulation (5 to 10 mA, 0.02 msec, 4.3 H2) was recorded by subcutaneous electrodes placed along the length of the spine (T-10, L-1, and L-4). Six animals (group I) subjected to aortic cross-clamping alone demonstrated a characteristic time- and level-dependent deterioration and loss of MEP. Ischemic cord dysfunction (as determined by time from clamping to loss of MEP) progressed from the distal to the proximal cord (L-4 = 11.3 +/- 1.5 minutes; L-1 = 14.9 +/- 2.3 minutes; T-10 = 16.9 +/- 2.3 minutes; p less than 0.05 between all levels). Reperfusion of the distal aorta 20 minutes after clamping resulted in MEP return that progressed from the proximal (T-10) to distal (L-1 and L-4) cord. In another six animals (group II), distal perfusion (mean blood pressure = 95 mm Hg) was maintained for 1 hour after cross-clamping by left atrial-femoral artery bypass. Normal configuration and amplitude of MEP was maintained throughout the cross-clamping period. These data suggest that distinctive changes in MEP indicative of reversible ischemia of spinal cord motor tracts occur after aortic cross-clamping. Such ischemia begins in the most distal cord, exhibits upward progression with time, and can be prevented by maintenance of adequate distal aortic perfusion. Clinical use of MEP monitoring during thoracic aneurysmectomy may provide a method for intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of motor tract perfusion.\r"

In our study, a well-characterized murine monoclonal antibody (LJ-CP8, 10 mg/kg) was infused into baboons to assess the hemostatic consequences and antithrombotic effectiveness of blocking the platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor for fibrinogen and other adhesive glycoproteins. Five treated animals and six control animals were evaluated with serial measurements of platelet count, bleeding time, and platelet aggregation ex vivo (in response to adenosine diphosphate and collagen). Indium 111-labeled platelet deposition onto femoral vascular grafts (4 mm inner diameter Gore-Tex) implanted immediately after antibody infusion was measured by quantitative gamma camera imaging. Although the antibody did not alter circulating platelet counts, bleeding times were immediately prolonged to more than 30 minutes (vs. 4.8 +/- 0.4 minutes pretreatment) with only partial normalization by 48 hours (8.3 +/- 1.0 minutes, p less than 0.05). Platelet aggregation in response to both collagen and adenosine diphosphate was abolished immediately and remained impaired for 48 hours. Despite the profound inhibition of platelet function, graft platelet deposition was equivalent postoperatively in both the treated and untreated groups (p greater than 0.5), averaging approximately 5 x 10(9) platelets per graft. Graft-associated indium 111-labeled platelet activity increased over 48 hours and was not reduced by the antibody treatment (p greater than 0.5 at all times). All grafts were removed at 8 days; only one graft from a treated animal was found patent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Infrarenal aortic graft infections were established in 18 dogs by implantation of Dacron prostheses colonized in vitro with a slime-producing strain of S. epidermidis to form an adherent bacteria-laden biofilm (5 X 10(6) colony-forming units/cm2 graft). Study animals developed a graft infection with anatomic and microbiologic characteristics typical of late prosthetic graft infections in humans (sterile perigraft exudate, absent graft incorporation, and normal serum leukocyte count and sedimentation rate). The S. epidermidis study strain was isolated from 14 of 18 explanted grafts (78%) by mechanical disruption of the graft surface biofilm and culture in broth media. Four dogs with sterile graft cultures had histologic evidence of bacterial infection. The established prosthetic surface biofilm infection was treated by graft excision, parenteral cefazolin, and graft replacement with a Dacron or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular prosthesis. One month after graft replacement, no PTFE graft had signs of infection, but perigraft exudate and inflammation involved three of nine Dacron grafts (33%). The study strain was recovered from four of nine PTFE grafts (44%) and two of nine Dacron (22%) replacement grafts (p greater than 0.05). Prosthetic replacement of Dacron prostheses infected by S. epidermidis as a bacteria-laden surface biofilm can result in early graft healing, but persistent colonization of one third of replacement grafts signify that recurrent clinical infection remains a risk.\r"

One patient suffered a minor stroke after operation. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 110 months (median 36 months). In 16 cases, simple endarterectomy with or without vein patch closure was performed (type I). In two cases the ostium of the ICA was occluded with interrupted sutures after endarterectomy (type II). In the remaining seven cases the ICA was transposed as a patch over the endarterectomized ECA after endarterectomy (type III). All but six patients (six sides) underwent duplex scanning or angiography during follow-up. Four of nine patients with previous nonlateralizing symptoms had persistent symptoms after operation, whereas none of those with previous amaurosis fugax did. Recurrent occlusive disease was more common in type I reconstructions (p less than 0.05). Proper ECA reconstruction results in long-term patency. In the patient with ipsilateral ICA occlusion, transposition of the ICA as a patch over the endarterectomized ECA offers a valid hemodynamic solution. Objective parameters are needed to identify patients with nonlateralizing symptoms who will benefit from operation.\r"

The overall sensitivities for IPG and PRG were significantly better in the diagnosis group (71% [69 of 97 patients] and 78% [82 of 105], respectively) compared with the surveillance group (20% [14 of 71] and 27% [17 of 63], respectively) (p less than 0.0001). The sensitivities for IPG and PRG detecting proximal (A/K) thrombi was 83% (68 of 82 patients) and 92% (79 of 86) in the diagnosis group compared with 32% (11 of 34) and 33% (9 of 27) in the surveillance group (p less than 0.0001). Although there was no difference in overall incidence of DVT between the diagnosis group (56%, 118 of 212 patients) and the surveillance group (55%, 76 of 139), the results can be explained by the difference in A/K thrombi (84% [99 of 118] and 47% [36 of 76]) (p less than 0.001) and occlusive A/K thrombi (84% [58 of 69] and 23% [7 of 31]) (p less than 0.0001), respectively. Of the patients with A/K thrombi, 97% (67 of 69) in the diagnosis group had hemodynamically detectable thrombi compared with only 48% (12 of 25) in the surveillance group (p less than 0.001). Combining the RFUT with the noninvasive studies for surveillance significantly improved the sensitivity for both A/K and distal thrombi. Patient selection also appears to have a significant influence on the results of the combination of IPG and RFUT when the current surveillance group is compared with similarly performed studies in a previously reported diagnosis group. The location and magnitude of thrombi in any patient population can be skewed depending on indications and timing of testing, thereby significantly affecting the sensitivity of noninvasive tests. IPG and PRG are reliable for evaluating patients with suspected DVT. However, patients with postoperative DVT have a high incidence of nonocclusive thrombi. Because noninvasive hemodynamic tests cannot identify accurately postoperative DVT, they cannot be used to generate epidemiologic data or as end points for studies evaluating efficacy of prophylaxis in patients undergoing total joint replacement, and anatomic studies of the deep venous system continue to be required.\r"

  ".W": "A photoplethysmographic technique was used in 30 consecutive patients who had abdominal aortic reconstruction to assess colonic viability intraoperatively. A sterile pulse oximeter probe was used to measure arterial pulsatility and transcolonic oxygen saturation (TCOS) in the proximal, midportion, and distal sigmoid colon before and after the reconstruction. No attempt at inferior mesenteric revascularization was made, irrespective of the photoplethysmographic results. The status of the colon was assessed between the third and sixth postoperative day by a colonoscopist unaware of the intraoperative data. Before the reconstructive procedure photoplethysmography displayed pulsatile flow in all patients with a mean TCOS of 95% +/- 0.4%. After reconstruction, 28 patients (93%) demonstrated unchanged pulsatility with mean TCOS of 94% +/- 0.4%. Despite ligation of a patent inferior mesenteric artery in 10 of these patients, all 28 had normal colonoscopic examinations. By contrast, two patients (6.7%) had a loss of photoplethysmographic pulsatility with unmeasurable TCOS. Both of these patients had ligation of an initially patent inferior mesenteric artery and demonstrated evidence of ischemic mucosal changes at colonoscopy. Intraoperative colonic photoplethysmography represents an easily performed, accurate method for predicting colonic viability. A loss of pulsatility suggests inadequate postreconstructive colonic perfusion and mandates revascularization of the inferior mesenteric artery.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the value of exercise testing in the prediction of cardiac risk, 100 patients requiring arterial reconstructive surgery had either treadmill testing or arm ergometry before operation. Thirty-four patients then had abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, 48 had reconstructions for aortoiliac occlusive disease, and 18 had infrainguinal revascularization procedures. Cardiac complications included myocardial infarction in 10%, acute congestive failure in 5%, malignant ventricular arrhythmias in 7%, and cardiac death in 7%. Contingency table analysis showed that patients who achieved less than 85% of their predicted maximum heart rate (PMHR) during exercise testing had a complication rate of 24%, whereas patients who achieved more than 85% of PMHR had a 6% complication rate (p = 0.0396). The degree of ST segment depression during exercise testing was not a significant predictor of cardiac complications. However, patients who had a positive stress test (ST depression more than 1 mm) and achieved less than 85% of their PMHR had a complication rate of 33%, whereas patients with a positive stress test who achieved more than 85% of their PMHR had no complications (p = 0.048). Statistical analysis with a logistic regression model showed two factors to be significant. Patients who achieved a high maximum heart rate during exercise testing had a low probability of developing postoperative cardiac complications (p = 0.04), as did patients who achieved high cardiac work load maximal oxygen uptake (p = 0.03). We conclude that preoperative exercise testing is useful to predict cardiac complications after arterial reconstruction. Patients who are able to achieve more than 85% of their PMHR and a high maximal oxygen uptake represent a low-risk group.\r"

Forty-three New Zealand white rabbits were allocated to receive a combination of aspirin 10 mg/kg/day and dipyridamole 10 mg/kg/day (n = 23) or placebo (n = 20). Both regimens began 3 days before insertion of PTFE aortic grafts (10 mm long and 3 mm internal diameter). Serum thromboxane B2 concentration in the control group averaged 254 +/- 22 ng/ml (+/- standard error of the mean) and 40 +/- 23 ng/ml in the treatment group (p less than 0.001). Grafts and adjacent aorta were harvested at 2 weeks (n = 4), 4 weeks (n = 9), 8 weeks (n = 13), and 12 weeks (n = 17) after implantation. Morphologic techniques, including conventional light microscopy, immunoperoxidase staining for endothelial factor VIII-related antigen, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that neointima was composed of endothelial cells arising by ingrowth at anastomotic site and as islands in the center of the graft. The percentage of graft neoendothelialization was measured by SEM. At 2 weeks 18% +/- 2% of the PTFE surface was covered with endothelium in the aspirin/dipyridamole group. The percentages of graft neoendothelialization for the treatment and control groups at 4 weeks were 44% +/- 13% (n = 5) and 46% +/- 10% (n = 4) (p = NS), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of pressure, flow, and pulsatility on the release of prostacyclin (measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane (measured as TxB2) was assessed in canine jugular veins perfused ex vivo with Hanks' balanced salt solution for five consecutive 15-minute periods. Control segments were perfused at 7 mm Hg with nonpulsatile flow at a rate of 90 ml/min, whereas experimental segments were perfused with pulsatile flow as well as nonpulsatile flow at pressures of 50 or 100 mm Hg and flow rates of 60 or 130 ml/min. Prostacyclin release from control segments during the first 15-minute period was 49.5 +/- 7.4 pg/mm2/15 min, which declined to 13.9 +/- 2.5 pg/mm2/15 min after 60 minutes (p less than 0.002). Arachidonic acid stimulation during the last 15-minute perfusion period increased the release to 56.1 +/- 9.4 pg/mm2/15 min (p less than 0.002). Thromboxane release from control segments was initially 4.4 +/- 1.2 pg/mm2/15 min, which declined to 0.8 +/- 0.2 pg/mm2/15 min after 60 minutes (p less than 0.002), and subsequently increased with arachidonic acid stimulation to 1.3 +/- 0.1 pg/mm2/15 min (p less than 0.01). In contrast to control perfusion conditions, changes in nonpulsatile flow rates did not affect prostacyclin release, whereas thromboxane release was lower when perfused at 60 ml/min. Pressures of 50 and 100 mm Hg increased the initial release of prostacyclin. Similarly, pulsatile flow enhanced prostacyclin release at both low and high pressures, being more pronounced with the latter.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

These patients were defined as having \"white coat\" hypertension, and they were more likely to be female and younger, to weigh less, and to be more recently diagnosed than patients whose pressure was elevated both in the clinic and during ambulatory monitoring. Patients with white coat hypertension did not show a generalized increase of blood pressure lability, nor an exaggerated pressor response while at work. The phenomenon is more pronounced when blood pressure is measured by a physician than by a technician. In such patients, the pressor response may be relatively specific to the physician's office and lead to significant misclassification of hypertension.\r"

Somewhat smaller cities (population, 125,000 to 200,000) had far less complete coverage. Even when one includes board-certified internists who declared themselves subspecialists but lacked certification, there were many relatively large cities without complete coverage. Between now and 2000, an appreciable portion of the projected larger pool of board-certified subspecialists will be required to deal with a growing population and an increase in per capita demand for care. Others will locate in underserved or underserved cities, but our data suggest that even in 2000, many relatively large cities will have a deficit of most types of subspecialists.\r"

More than three fourths indicated that Part I NBME scores were used in selecting residents; more than half of the programs used these scores as a means to determine whom to interview. The direct use of NBME scores in the residency application process is widespread; however, such use of NBME scores is not consistent with the purposes of the National Board. The preeminent role of the faculty in the evaluation of medical students and in the assessment of their clinical competence needs emphasis.\r"

Roentgenographic parenchymal opacities, decreased pulmonary diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide, decreased flow at low lung volume, rales, and clubbing were each significantly related to the number of years elapsed since first exposure to asbestos and cigarette smoking status when analyzed by logistic regression. A dose-dependent cigarette smoking response that was consistent with synergism was present only for parenchymal opacities and decreased flow at low lung volume. These findings suggest that decreased flow at low lung volume, possibly reflecting peribronchiolar fibrosis, may be a functional corollary to smoking-associated parenchymal roentgenographic opacities among some asbestos-exposed individuals.\r"

We compared results of serum pesticide assays for these exposed persons with results for an unexposed group of 94 persons from the same geographic area and the results from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The exposed group had significantly higher mean levels of primary heptachlor metabolites--ie, heptachlor epoxide (0.84 +/- 1.0 vs 0.50 +/- 0.9 parts per billion) and oxychlordane (0.71 +/- 0.8 vs 0.49 +/- 1.1 parts per billion)--than the unexposed group. In the exposed group, 21.2% had elevated serum concentrations of these same metabolites; this rate was significantly greater than the rates in both the unexposed farm family members (heptachlor epoxide, 3.8%; oxychlordane, 6.3%) and the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey sample (2.5% for both metabolites). However, we found no evidence of related acute and/or subacute hepatic effects in these exposed persons regardless of their serum concentrations of pesticide residues.\r"

The team includes a faculty physician and a clinical nurse specialist who provide primary medical care, family support, and in-service guidance to hospital staff about ethical issues. A multidisciplinary approach incorporates nursing, pastoral care, social work, and other hospital services. We report our experience from November 1985 through May 1987, during which time 222 patients were referred to the team; 212 patients were accepted. The goals and operation of the service are described. The most common (n = 62, 29%) diagnosis on referral was global central nervous system anoxia following cardiopulmonary arrest. Other severe neurological conditions accounted for an additional 79 patients (37%). Comparison of patients on the service with a similar group revealed no difference in survival rate, although hospital length of stay and charges were progressively reduced after implementation of the service. This approach to the care of hopelessly ill patients may serve as an alternative method of treatment in similar hospital settings.\r"

Eighty-six percent of interferon alfa-treated patients and 89% of placebo-treated patients had received previous therapy for condylomata acuminata. Side effects, usually flulike symptoms, occurred briefly after the injections; if present, they disappeared before the end of the third week of therapy. Treatment completely eliminated warts in 62% of interferon alfa-treated patients compared with only 21% of placebo-treated patients.

In an effort to study the cause and clinical course of adult epiglottitis, eight serially hospitalized adult patients with supraglottitis over a ten-month period were prospectively evaluated, including a daily laryngeal examination. Although multiple anatomic sites in the larynx and oropharynx were inflamed, the epiglottis was often not the most involved area and was actually normal in one patient. Bacterial cultures were harvested from blood, the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, and the vallecula in all patients and the preepiglottic space in two patients. In no case was H influenzae demonstrated. No patient developed respiratory compromise. It was concluded that epiglottitis is an inaccurate description of this disorder and that this non-H influenzae adult variety of supraglottitis seemingly can follow a less pernicious course than the classically described infection.\r"

Of the 88 evening-shift cardiac arrests during this time, one specific nurse (Nurse 14) was the care giver for 57 (65%). Eight of ten epidemic-period patients who experienced shift-specific circadian recurrences of cardiac arrests were patients of Nurse 14. No therapeutic intervention and no other health care provider was as strongly associated with evening-shift cardiac arrests as was Nurse 14. Multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that when risk of cardiac arrest was adjusted for age, sex, severity of illness, and postoperative status, patients of Nurse 14 were 47.5 times more likely to experience arrest than were other nurses' patients. An expert determined that, compared with other nurses, the cardiac arrests among Nurse 14's patients were more likely to be consistent with unexplained hyperkalemia, to be unexpected in timing, and to be inconsistent with the clinical course. The epidemic ceased when Nurse 14 left employment at the intensive care unit in March 1985. Epidemiologic surveillance of adverse outcomes in health care settings is recommended.\r"

Seven hundred forty-seven nonfederal short-term hospitals were divided in terms of the number of neighboring hospitals within a 24-km radius, and this measure of hospital concentration and competition was measured against length of stay for ten surgical procedures, using 1982 data on 498454 patient discharges. Patient, physician, and hospital characteristics associated with length of stay were controlled for. Competition-related percentage increases in length of stay were identified for all procedures, including total hip replacement (14.8%), transurethral prostatectomy (13.9%), intestinal operations (14.0%), stomach operations (14.7%), hysterectomy (6.9%), cholecystectomy (9.1%), hernia repair (10.5%), appendectomy (8.4%), cardiac catheterization (22.9%), and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (21.2%).

A modified, respiratory symptom questionnaire and spirometry were administered to all study participants before and after their work shift, and formaldehyde levels were determined for each test subject. Over the course of the monitored work shift, test subjects demonstrated a dose-dependent excess of irritant symptoms and a statistically significant decline in certain lung function parameters. Analysis of test and control subject data combined revealed a correlation between formaldehyde exposure and these pulmonary changes. Baseline spirometry values were not significantly different between test and control groups, and formaldehyde-exposed workers did not report an excess of respiratory symptoms. Formaldehyde is a dose-dependent irritant of the eyes and mucous membranes at low-level exposures. It can exert a small, across-shift effect on airways but after a mean exposure of ten years does not appear to cause permanent respiratory impairment.\r"

Periprosthetic infections were due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species. Other infectious complications incurred by some of the patients included pneumonia, empyema, urinary tract infection, and intravascular line sepsis with Candida. Intensive antimicrobial therapy for prolonged periods seemed to suppress but not to eradicate infection and was accompanied by the appearance of multiresistant bacterial strains. Complications of antimicrobial therapy included diarrhea secondary to overgrowth with Clostridium difficile in two patients. Use of the current device for more than 30 days should be considered extraordinary and should be reserved for patients for whom no other form of life support is available.\r"

  ".W": "Hypercalcemia is associated with a few primary malignant neoplasms and with a variety of tumors that have spread by metastases. Hyperparathyroidism is a diagnosis that is usually not considered in these patients. At our institution, 18 patients with malignant tumors presented over a 6-year period with hypercalcemia caused by hyperparathyroidism. There were five men and 13 women with a mean age of 48 years (range 24-87 years). Primary tumors in these patients included colon carcinoma (four cases), breast carcinoma (four cases), lymphoma (four cases), thyroid carcinoma (four cases), Paget's disease (one case), and lung carcinoma (one case). Metastases of the primary tumor occurred in seven patients, and in 11 patients the tumor was not metastatic or recurrent. Serum levels of calcium, phosphate, and chloride averaged 11.8 mg/dl, and 100 mEq/liter, respectively. C-terminal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels ranged from 300 to 1,900 pg/ml with an average of 1,150 pg/ml (normal 50-340 pg/ml). At operation, a single parathyroid adenoma was discovered in 15 patients, and four-gland hyperplasia was noted in three patients. In all cases, serum levels of calcium returned to normal after operation. We conclude that patients with malignant tumors and concomitant hypercalcemia should be evaluated for the possibility of hyperparathyroidism. In cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, elevated C-terminal PTH level should be diagnostic. If hyperparathyroidism is determined to be the cause of hypercalcemia, neck exploration and parathyroidectomy are indicated.\r"

A review of all cases with a tissue diagnosis of carcinoma involving uterus and ovary was undertaken to identify those cases which possibly represent independent primaries. Seventeen such cases were identified on the basis of pathologic features, 15 of which revealed endometrioid type carcinoma at both sites. These 15 patients, who constitute the study group, were treated surgically with or without adjuvant therapy. Thirteen patients have been followed up for 1 to 12 years. Twelve patients are alive and free of disease. Vaginal vault recurrence occurred in a single patient. This was treated successfully. One patient died of an unrelated cause. The good survival fortifies the pathological impression that these cases represent independent primaries.\r"

The overall survival rate was statistically higher in patients who had surgery and radiation compared to the group receiving radiation alone. The one-, two-, and five-year survival rates of patients receiving combined treatment vs radiotherapy alone were 65% vs 35%, 25% vs 14%, and 15% vs 6%. Age, total radiation dose, and inclusion of the supraclavicular areas in the radiation portals did not impact on outcome. Other prognostic factors are discussed. Long term survivors were noted to be at substantial risk for the development of a second epidermoid malignancy in the upper aerodigestive tract.

After tumor resection enhancing activity disappears at a rate depending on the size of the resected tumor. Spleen cells from tumor-bearing mice also evoke a complex vascular response, lymphocyte-induced angiogenesis (LIA) elicited via the release of lymphokines from activated T cells. As angiogenic factors promote tumor development we investigated if SCS from tumor-bearing and tumor-resected mice contain factors capable of evoking a LIA response. Angiogenic activity was detected by SCS of small and large tumor-bearing mice as well as in large tumor-resected mice. On the other hand, SCS from small tumor-resected mice are not able to evoke an angiogenic response. Possibly, the large antigenic burden in LTRM stimulate the immune system in a different way than in STRM. We can suggest that the different behavior of spleen cells after small and large tumor removal can be explained by quantitative or qualitative changes in the spleen subpopulations.\r"

However, if verapamil is added to the macrophages or neutrophil tumor cell suspensions in microgram concentrations (0.1 microgram to 0.1 mg), there is marked inhibition of tumor cell killing. The inhibitory effect for the macrophages resulted from an effect of verapamil on both the effector and target cells. When either the effector cells or target cells were preincubated with verapamil, they became resistant to the effects of the cytotoxic macrophages. Cytotoxicity was also inhibited when 0.1 mg of verapamil was added to the macrophages monolayers either at the time of addition of the tumor cells or 15-30 min after addition of the tumor cells, whereas no inhibition of cytotoxicity occurred when verapamil was added more than 30 min after the initiation of the cytotoxic reaction. For the neutrophils it was observed that the inhibitory activity resulted from an effect of verapamil on the effector cells rather than the target cells. When the effector cells were preincubated with verapamil they became incapable of killing the tumor cells, whereas preincubation of the target cells with verapamil had no effect on their ability to be killed by the neutrophils. Cytotoxicity was also inhibited when 0.1 mg of verapamil was added to the neutrophil monolayers either at the time of addition of the tumor cells or 15-60 min after addition of the tumor cells, whereas no inhibition of cytotoxicity occurred when verapamil was added more than 60 min after the initiation of the cytotoxic reaction.\r"

  ".W": "Colonic gamma glutamyl transferase activity is raised in colonic malignancy. This study was undertaken to determine how early and how extensively this raised activity occurs during carcinogenesis. Sixty rats were given weekly injections of dimethylhydrazine for 16 weeks, and 20 rats acted as controls. Groups of treated and control rats were sacrificed at regular intervals during the pre-cancerous phase of carcinogenesis, and gamma glutamyl transferase activity was measured at several sites in the colon. Gamma glutamyl transferase activity was raised as early as 4 weeks after the first injection of dimethylhydrazine (p less than 0.05), and the elevation persisted until the development of overt tumours. The raised gamma glutamyl transferase activity was observed throughout both the proximal and distal colon long before the appearance of macroscopic tumours. We conclude that an early and widespread elevation of colonic gamma glutamyl transferase activity occurs during carcinogenesis. This may have useful applications in the early detection of colonic malignancy.\r"

The primary tumor in the appendix was discovered 10 months later at the time of a \"second look\" laparotomy. The ovarian metastasis showed both goblet cell elements and tubular formations with numerous argyrophilic cells, indicating that both components of these tumors may metastasize, a finding at variance with the conclusions of some authors who suggest that only the mucinous component may metastasize. Theories of histogenesis of these tumors are discussed, and 12 previously reported cases presenting as Krukenberg tumors (all bilateral) are reviewed. Because the primary tumor in the appendix may be small and easily missed, appendectomy is recommended in all patients with Krukenberg tumors when another primary site cannot be identified at the time of surgery.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of oxygenation (100% oxygen) of the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solutions No. 1 (MacCarthy) and No.2 (Plegisol, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill.) was examined in the isolated working rat heart subjected to long periods (3 hours for studies with solution No. 1 and 4 hours for studies with solution No. 2) of hypothermic (20 degrees C) ischemic arrest with multidose (every 30 minutes) cardioplegic infusion. At the aortic infusion point the oxygen tension of the oxygenated solutions (measured at 20 degrees C) was in the range of 320 to 560 mm Hg whereas that of the nonoxygenated solutions was less than 150 mm Hg. Twenty hearts (10 oxygenated and 10 nonoxygenated) were studied for each solution. The studies with solution No. 1 demonstrated that oxygenation led to a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in the incidence of persistent ventricular fibrillation during postischemic reperfusion. Oxygenation of the cardioplegic solution also improved postischemic functional recovery so that the recovery of aortic flow was improved from 18.7% +/- 8.9% (of its preischemic control level) in the nonoxygenated group to 54.6% +/- 6.6% in the oxygenated group (p less than 0.025). Creatine kinase leakage was also significantly reduced from 27.5 +/- 4.8 to 9.9 +/- 0.6 IU/15 min/gm dry weight (p less than 0.005). Studies with solution No. 2 indicated that protection was better than with solution No. 1, even in the absence of oxygenation. A better degree of functional recovery was obtained after 4 hours of arrest with solution No. 2 than that obtained after only 3 hours of arrest with solution No. 1, and persistent ventricular ventricular fibrillation was never observed with solution No. 2. However, despite the superior performance with solution No. 2, further improvements could be obtained by oxygenation, with that time from the onset of reperfusion to the return of regular sinus rhythm being reduced from 55 +/- 8 to 35 +/- 2 seconds (p less than 0.01), postischemic recovery of aortic flow increasing from 59.8% +/- 7.4% to 85.7% +/- 2.5% (p less than 0.005), and creatine kinase leakage being reduced from 38.1 +/- 7.3 to 16.2 +/- 1.5 IU/15 min/gm dry weight (p less than 0.005). It is concluded that oxygenation of the St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solutions improves their ability to protect the heart against long periods of ischemia and that this is manifested by improved postischemic electrical stability, functional recovery, and reduced creatine kinase leakage.\r"

Ten patients required further resections for persisting collapse, kinking of the apical segment of a lower lobe, or because the previous resection had been too limited. The long-term results of these extensive bilateral resections in our group of patients are excellent. The quantitative function, more than 20 years after the last resection, lies markedly above the predicted value for the number of remaining segments. The qualitative function did not deteriorate over the years. It is clear that extensive bilateral bronchiectasis does not, per se, constitute a contraindication to resection, provided that at least six normal segments can be preserved.\r"

  ".W": "We evaluated effects of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass on the cerebral circulation and metabolism of six dogs over a temperature range of 37 degrees to 20 degrees C under alphastat acid-base regulation (uncorrected for body temperature). Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen was determined from the difference between arterial and sagittal sinus blood oxygen contents, and direct cerebral blood flow measurements of the venous outflow from the isolated sagittal sinus. After core cooling at a constant perfusion flow rate of 80 ml/kg/min, cerebral blood flow significantly reduced to 10.0 +/- 1.1 ml/100 gm/min at 20 degrees C (20% +/- 2% of that at 37 degrees C) because of an increase in the cerebral vascular resistance (339% +/- 48%). Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen reduced to 18% +/- 2%. The upper body vascular resistance decreased to a greater extent than the lower body resistance (37% +/- 4% versus 82% +/- 12%). In the selective cerebral perfusion system at 20 degrees C, when perfusion pressure (mean carotid arterial pressure minus central venous pressure) was lowered from 90 mm Hg by graded reduction of the perfusion flow rate, cerebral blood flow remained constant down to a perfusion pressure of 40 mm Hg, then steeply declined. Cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen also kept a constant level down to 30 mm Hg, then fell abruptly. Definite autoregulatory response was detected even in profound hypothermic nonpulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass. These results suggest that cerebral perfusion flow should be regulated so as to keep the perfusion pressure within the range of cerebral autoregulation to prevent cerebral ischemia or hyperperfusion, especially during selective cerebral perfusion for operations on the aortic arch.\r"

Eighty-two percent entered within the first 2 days of life. Seventy-six of the 187 patients were initially entered into a treatment protocol leading to an arterial switch repair, 45 into one leading to an atrial switch (Mustard) repair, and 49 into one leading to a Senning repair. Five (7%) of the patients entered initially into an arterial switch protocol later were crossed over to an atrial switch protocol, and 7% of those entered into an atrial switch (Mustard) protocol were crossed over to an arterial switch protocol. Formal follow-up information is available on all patients. Only 5% of patients entered into an arterial switch protocol were without repair 2 weeks after entry, whereas 96% and 100%, respectively, of those entered into a Mustard or Senning atrial switch protocol were without repair at that time. Ninety-seven percent of the first group had no preliminary procedures other than balloon atrial septostomy, which was true of only 76% and 90%, respectively, of the last two groups. No deaths before repair occurred in the first group, whereas five occurred in the latter two groups (P = 0.06). Overall survival rate among the 187 patients was 81% at 1 year. The only risk factors for death were birth weight, date of entry into the study, and an arterial switch protocol in the group of institutions at high risk for arterial switch repair; neither an arterial nor an atrial switch protocol was a risk factor per se. According to the multivariate equation, the 12-month predicted survival rate of a patient with a birth weight of 3.4 kg, entered currently into atrial or arterial switch protocols (except in the high risk for arterial switch group of institutions) is 92%.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial switch for repair of transposition of the great arteries was performed on 53 patients since October 1983. These patients were divided into three groups: group I, 25 infants with an intact ventricular septum who had primary repair in the first month of life (2 to 34 days of age, mean 9.7 +/- 6.6); group II, 13 patients with an intact ventricular septum who had anatomic repair after a preliminary procedure (pulmonary artery banding in 13, shunt in 10, atrial septectomy in 1); and group III, 15 infants with transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect. In group III, six patients had Taussig-Bing abnormality, nine had previous pulmonary artery banding, three had coarctation of the aorta repaired earlier in life, and four were less than 2 weeks old. Overall early mortality was 9.4% (5/53: group I 8%, group II 7.6%, group III 13.3%). Two late deaths occurred in group II 10 and 12 weeks postoperatively after infection and high fever. A third late death 18 weeks postoperatively was due to aspiration in an infant with Goldenhar's syndrome. Mortality and morbidity decreased significantly after an initial learning period (no deaths from July 1985 to March 1987 overall, and none in the last 15 infants operated on in group I). The surviving 45 patients are doing well. All have normal sinus rhythm. Two had transient asymptomatic arrhythmias. Left and right ventricular function assessed by echocardiogram and postoperative cardiac catheterization were within normal ranges in all but two patients, one with pulmonary artery stenosis and one (Taussig-Bing abnormality with two large ventricular septal defects) with severe pulmonary vascular disease (9.6 units) observed before anatomic repair. The right ventricular pressure at catheterization ranged from 27 to 42 mm Hg in 12 patients and was 55 mm Hg in two. There was no aortic stenosis. Aortic insufficiency was trivial in three patients and mild in one. We conclude that excellent results can be obtained with arterial switch for transposition of the great arteries with or without ventricular septal defect, especially in neonates.\r"

The experience with a selective approach in 52 patients with cancer in this location is reviewed. Thirty-two of the cancers were squamous cell, 13 adenocarcinoma, and seven adenocarcinoma associated with Barrett's esophagus. In 19, the tumor was not resectable and all of these patients died within a year. In 19 patients, a palliative resection could be done. Actuarial survival was 31% at 1 year. Only one patient was alive after 5 years. Initially, 16 patients with noncircumferential lesions on endoscopy and/or no evidence of spread to mediastinal lymph nodes on computed tomographic scan were considered to have potentially curable lesions. All were less than 75 years old and had a forced expiratory volume in 1 second greater than 1.5 L and a resting ejection fraction greater than 40%. A curative resection consisting of an en bloc thoracic esophagectomy, mediastinal lymphadenectomy, and an 80% gastrectomy with abdominal lymphadenectomy was performed in 14. The left colon was used to reestablish the gastrointestinal continuity. Two patients had more extensive disease discovered at operation, and the curative en bloc resection was abandoned. Absence of full wall penetration or involvement of four or fewer regional nodes, or both, was correctly predicted by preoperative and intraoperative staging in 86% of the patients. Operative mortality of a curative en bloc resection was 7% (1/14), and the actuarial survival rates were 76%, 66%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 5 years. Inferences are made from these results on tumor characteristics associated with survival, the extent of resection necessary for cure, the difficulty of accomplishing a curative en bloc resection by the transhiatal approach, the contraindication to curative en bloc resection, and the need for a surveillance program for patients with Barrett's esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "The concept of central shunting in smaller children with the Waterston shunt was initially well accepted. It has been abandoned because of the difficult estimation of lumen size, preferential flow to the right side, and difficulty in the take-down of the shunt. We have replaced the Waterston shunt with a short segment of polytetrafluoroethylene between the ascending aorta and the main pulmonary artery. From January 1979 to December 1986, 190 shunt operations were performed in 157 patients, with the use of 26 classic Blalock-Taussig shunts (13.7%), six Waterston shunts (3.1%), nine Glenn shunts (4.7%), 80 central aortopulmonary polytetrafluoroethylene shunts (42.2%), and 69 modified Blalock-Taussig shunts (36.3%). Polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used for 149 of the 190 (78.4%) shunts. Overall mortality was 15.2%, with nine early deaths (4.7%) and 20 late deaths (10.5%). Deaths were due to the complex nature of the congenital anomaly or definitive surgical repair. The patients weighed from 1.6 to 48 kg and ages ranged from 1 day to 22 years. We have modified our technique so that (1) graft length is less than 0.5 cm and both ends are beveled, (2) the aortotomy is fashioned with a punch, (3) the center of the polytetrafluoroethylene graft is never clamped, (4) heparin is given during the construction of the shunt, and (5) aspirin (10 mg/kg/day) is administered daily. Patency ranges from 1 to 4 years. We conclude that the polytetrafluoroethylene shunt provides excellent palliation and that the central shunt, in the smaller child and infant, offers the benefits of shunting without distortion of the peripheral pulmonary arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Stenosis or discontinuity of the pulmonary arteries associated with congenital cardiac defects was repaired in 12 patients, in conjunction with the Blalock-Taussig shunt. This approach was based on the following concepts: (1) The shunted blood is more uniformly distributed to both lungs, which avoids predominance of flow to the ipsilateral lung and long-term pulmonary vascular damage; (2) because adequate blood flow is maintained, the contralateral lung growth will be near normal; (3) the possibility of future surgical correction is enhanced. The ages of the patients ranged from 2 to 24 months. Five had a primary diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot, three had double outlet of the right ventricle, three had single ventricle, and one had a truncus type anomaly. All operations were performed without cardiopulmonary bypass. Dilation of the stenotic segment was performed in two patients, enlargement of the stenotic segment in three, and resection of the segment and end-to-end anastomosis in four. Nonconfluent pulmonary arteries were corrected in three patients. In one, the stenotic segment was resected and an anastomosis was made between the left pulmonary artery and pulmonary trunk. In another patient, a segment of the right subclavian artery was interposed between the pulmonary trunk and intrahilar left pulmonary artery. In the third patient, the right pulmonary artery was disconnected from the aorta and a tube was interposed between the right and left pulmonary arteries. There were no intraoperative or late deaths, and postoperative angiographic evaluations were satisfactory. We believe that in infants needing a Blalock-Taussig shunt the pulmonary artery anomalies, if present, should be corrected simultaneously.\r"

  ".W": "The feasibility of anatomic repair (defined as the reconstruction of normal ventriculoarterial connection) was investigated in 104 patients who underwent an operation for anomalies of ventriculoarterial connection associated with ventricular septal defect. Three types of anatomic repair were used: intraventricular rerouting, REV (association of intraventricular rerouting with translocation of the pulmonary arterial trunk on the right ventricle), and arterial switch associated with closure of the ventricular septal defect. Intraventricular repair was considered to be the best and simplest method when possible. In the other cases, REV was indicated if pulmonary outflow tract obstruction was present, and arterial switch was performed when the tract was patent. The feasibility of intraventricular repair was related to the distances between the tricuspid valve and the semilunar valves. Preoperative measurement of these distances is an essential criterion to choose the appropriate repair of anomalies of ventriculoarterial connection associated with ventricular septal defect.\r"

  ".U": "88092784\r", 
  ".W": "From November 1980 to November 1985, 50 patients underwent anatomic repair of anomalies of ventriculoarterial connection associated with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction. The technique used was one that we have previously described, which we call REV. The principles of this technique are resection of the infundibular septum, construction of a tunnel connecting the left ventricle to the aorta, and direct anastomosis, without a prosthetic conduit, of the pulmonary arterial trunk with the right ventricle. The tunnel is situated beneath the aortic valve and occupies very little space in the right ventricular cavity. Age at operation ranged from 4 months to 13 years (mean 3.5 years). Twenty-six patients had a classic type of transposition of the great arteries; all other patients had various types of anomalies of ventriculoarterial connection in which it was impossible, after the intraventricular connection of the left ventricle to the aorta, to use the natural pulmonary orifice for the pulmonary outflow tract reconstruction. There were nine hospital deaths (18%) and one late death. Twenty-six of 29 patients whose follow-up time exceeded 1 year had an excellent clinical result. No stenosis of the aortic outflow tract was found. Four patients had significant pressure gradients on the pulmonary outflow tract. Our present experience with REV suggests that this technique allows anatomic repair in a wide variety of anomalies of ventriculoarterial connection associated with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, even in infants, with an acceptable rate of mortality and morbidity.\r"

  ".U": "88092858\r", 
  ".W": "Sixteen patients with locally advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder were given two to four cycles of combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin), and cisplatin (M-VAC) in an effort to reduce tumor size and enhance the potential for surgical resection. All patients had initial clinical staging (based on cystoscopy and cystoscopic biopsy, urine cytology, computed tomographic scanning, and excretory urography). Before each cycle, all patients had repeat clinical staging tests. Ten patients underwent postchemotherapy bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical cystoprostatectomy, and their bladders were examined histopathologically by step-sectioning techniques. One patient underwent abdominal exploration, bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy, and ipsilateral partial cystectomy. Five patients had repeat clinical staging only without removal of their bladders. Of the 16 patients, 5 (31%) had residual invasive tumor and no tumor response. Three patients (19%) had a partial response, two of whom had only carcinoma in situ (one with prostatic duct involvement) and one of whom had stage pT1, NO, MO disease. Five patients (31%) had normal findings on computed tomographic scans, cystoscopy, biopsy, and urine cytology and thus had complete responses. In addition, 3 of 11 patients who underwent pathologic staging had no residual tumor on clinical and surgical staging and were complete responders. The overall (partial + complete) response rate was 69%, and the overall complete remission rate (pathologic + clinical staging) was 50%. These results suggest that the concept of possible salvage of the bladder with the current treatment program might be premature and must be applied selectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The morphologic features of the anterior pituitary gland were studied by immunohistologic methods in 12 patients who had died of complications of anorexia nervosa, 4 patients who had died while on a \"crash diet\", 13 patients who had died of organic disease associated with inanition, and 5 age- and sex-matched control subjects who had been involved in sudden fatal accidents. All known pituitary hormones were found to be present. Abnormalities noted in both the patients with anorexia and those with organic inanition included relative hypogranulation of adrenocorticotropic and, to a lesser extent, growth hormone cells. These changes are of unknown importance but are likely the result of starvation in that they were not observed in patients on a \"crash diet\" or in control patients. We conclude that no specific or etiologic abnormalities are present in the pituitary glands of subjects with anorexia nervosa and that the altered secretion of adenohypophyseal hormones often noted in patients with this disorder cannot be attributed to a primary pituitary disorder.\r"

  ".W": "We prospectively evaluated a platelet-inhibitor regimen of dipyridamole and aspirin in 28 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and well-established nephropathy. After a mean treatment period of 4.3 years, iothalamate clearance (Ciot) was reasonably well maintained and urinary protein excretion was reduced in 7 patients (25%), whereas 21 (75%) had progressive nephropathy. Analysis of outcome revealed that all 7 patients with stable nephropathy and 9 of the 21 with progressive disease had baseline Ciot values that exceeded 50 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Shortened platelet survival improved after 3 months of treatment, and the distribution between patients who had stable and those who had progressive disease was approximately equal. Mean changes in fasting plasma glucose level, glycosylated hemoglobin, and blood pressure did not differ between these two groups. In a short-term protocol, urinary protein and thromboxane B2 significantly declined, whereas variable urinary levels of prostaglandin E2, 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha, and Ciot did not change after 3 months of treatment with dipyridamole and aspirin. These findings suggest that treatment with dipyridamole and aspirin may stabilize renal function by reducing platelet hypersensitivity and production of thromboxanes by platelet or renal tissue (or both). In turn, constrictor activity in the glomerular vessels, mesangial contractility, and glomerular membrane permeability are decreased. These data also add evidence in support of a role for thromboxane A2 in the pathogenesis of experimental and human glomerular disease.\r"

Commonly, patients with nasal stuffiness have mechanical factors such as nasal polyps and nasal septal deformities that cause obstruction. Rare causes of nasal symptoms include sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and both benign and malignant tumors. Another uncommon cause of nasal symptoms is obstruction of the nose due to masses in the nasopharynx. In this article, we describe two adult patients with nasopharyngeal masses who had nasal symptoms initially thought to be allergic in origin. Examination of the nasopharynx is an important part of the investigation of patients who have chronic nasal symptoms or atypical manifestations of nasal symptoms.\r"
