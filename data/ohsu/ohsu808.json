An arteriovenous difference for bupivacaine of approximately 20% was noted during the first 45-60 min after administration. Mean systemic venous plasma clearance (0.15 (0.08) litre h-1 kg-1) was less and the mean elimination half-life (6.85 (2.29) h) and mean body residence time (9.99 (3.00) h) were longer than reported previously for interpleural bupivacaine--possibly because of continued slow absorption of the drug from its absorption site.\r"

Noncompartmental analysis indicated that the addition of adrenaline had no effect on total body clearance, apparent volume of distribution at steady state or elimination half-life of bupivacaine. However, peak plasma concentrations were lower in the adrenaline group (mean (SD) [range]: 2.57 (0.61) [1.52-3.11] vs 3.22 (0.27) [2.84-3.53] micrograms ml-1, P less than 0.05) and the time to maximum concentration was delayed (median [range]: 25 [15-30] vs 15 [10-20] min, P less than 0.05). Analgesia was variable and no differences were detected between the two groups. The addition of adrenaline appears prudent to minimize possible bupivacaine toxicity.\r"

However, we have shown that HCN is not produced from SNP during analysis. Significant amounts of HCN were formed only when SNP was first incubated with blood. The yield of HCN was a function of the temperature, pH and time of incubation. The time for release of 50% of the HCN from SNP 5 mumol litre-1 at 37 degrees C in blood was 26.6 min with greater than 90% yield in 2 h, and in plasma the optimum pH was about 7.5. A u.v. method for measuring SNP suggests that, at clinically appropriate blood concentrations, SNP is confined to plasma.\r"

Plasma concentrations of SNP were measured therefore in 20 patients at the end of an infusion, with mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cyanide (HCN) concentrations. Plasma SNP concentrations (20-243 micrograms litre-1; mean = 123.5 micrograms litre-1), were related to infusion rate (r = 0.66, P less than 0.001), and declined rapidly to a mean (SD) of 7.7 (4.5) micrograms litre-1 in 15 min. The decay of SNP correlated closely with the increase in arterial pressure (mean MAP vs log mean plasma SNP concentrations: r = -0.993, P less than 0.001), and was probably biphasic: mean (SD) T1/2 alpha = 0.89 (0.62) min, T1/2 beta = 14.3 (12) min. Mean plasma HCN and mean plasma SNP concentrations decreased together (r = 0.955, P less than 0.001), thus confirming that in vivo decomposition of the drug is the source of HCN.\r"

  ".W": "Phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy was applied to the pig kidney in vivo to determine the metabolic effects of infusion of sodium nitroprusside, and of more severe hypotension produced by venesection or halothane. Sodium nitroprusside 7-20 micrograms kg-1 min-1 reduced mean systemic arterial pressure (AP) of the pig from 89 to 46 mm Hg. Glomerular filtration rate and total sodium reabsorption were reduced proportionally. Renal metabolism, assessed by the ratio [ATP]: [Pi] (inorganic phosphate), did not change. Adding halothane or venesection to nitroprusside hypotension caused a further reduction in systemic AP to 42 and 39 mm Hg, respectively. Renal [ATP] decreased in direct proportion to mean AP. It is concluded that sodium nitroprusside, even in high doses, does not reduce renal oxygen delivery as assessed by the ability of the kidney to maintain normal ATP content. However, haemorrhage or an increase in halothane dosage results in irreversible damage to the energy producing processes of the kidney. This may be relevant to the clinical use of the drug.\r"

Induction was smooth and maintenance easy to manage in both groups. Plasma concentrations were stable with a ratio of alfentanil to fentanyl of 100:1. Recovery times were equal and short, but recovery tests performed 3 h after operation showed that alfentanil produced a greater effect on ability to concentrate and fine co-ordination.\r"

The first injection (always cold) did not induce shivering in any of the subjects. The second and third injections, randomly cold or warm, were given after induction of shivering with cold blankets, but had no detectable effects on the intensity of shivering. This suggests that shivering in extradural anaesthesia does not result solely from cooling of the extradural space.\r"

Inter-observer agreement was good (Kappa statistic = 0.74, P less than 0.0001). The investigators found that cardiotocographic abnormalities were present in 33 of the asphyxiated infants (87%) and in 35 of the controls (29%) and predicted that the abnormalities were severe enough to lead to significant fetal metabolic acidosis at delivery in 23 asphyxiated infants (61%) and in 11 controls (9%). The differences between the two groups were highly significant (P less than 0.001). Using the traditional diagnostic criteria for fetal distress, the investigators found that fetal blood sampling was indicated in 58% of cases in the asphyxia group and in 20% of controls but was only performed in 16% of asphyxiated infants and in 8% of controls. Furthermore, the median response times of delivery suite staff for abnormal fetal heart rate patterns were similar whether the FHR changes, classified using Krebs' CTG scoring system, were moderate or severe: 80 min and 90 min, respectively. These findings suggest that interpretation of the intrapartum CTG continues to pose major problems for practising obstetricians.\r"

Caput was associated with a reduced oxygen saturation reading (mean reduction of 15%; P less than 0.001). This effect is partly due to a true drop in local tissue oxygenation but is exacerbated by a systematic error intrinsic to the physics of spectrophotometry. If continuous intrapartum oximetry is ever to become a part of routine obstetric monitoring then probes that pass through the cervix beyond the caput of the presenting part will be required if erroneously low readings are to be avoided.\r"

Between 1984 and 1988, 545 women (86%) underwent ultrasound directed follicle aspiration (UDFA) exclusively by the perurethral route. The mean follicle aspiration rate was 93%, and the mean number of oocytes per procedure was 5.8. The complication rate was 6%, but none was major. From July 1985 the clinical pregnancy rate per UDFA was 17% and per embryo transfer 21%. The perurethral approach was used in combination with another UDFA route in 91 women (14%) but the need to change route decreased with increasing operator experience. Perurethral UDFA is an efficient and safe method for harvesting oocytes.\r"

The administration of lignocaine plain led to decreases in the ratio of varying degrees in all fetuses regardless of the height of the initial A/B ratio. The injection of lignocaine with adrenaline produced identical results in fetuses with initially normal A/B ratios. In contrast, all six fetuses with initially high A/B ratios (above 2.90) who received the adrenaline-containing anaesthetic reacted with a rise in the ratio, and two of these developed transient heart rate decelerations. Thus, if the initial resistance in umbilical blood flow is high, even the small epidural dose of 40 micrograms of adrenaline produces a further increase which may be associated with clinical implications.\r"

The first developed depot-form was very effective, but had the disadvantage of a slowly metabolized carrier. we investigated the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerance and safety of 40 and 50 mg of a new rapidly eliminated depot-form in 61 postpartum women. Bromocriptine rapidly increased after injection and prolactin was effectively suppressed during the study-period of 60 days. Overall efficacy was very good or good in 98% and no rebound lactation occurred. Sixteen women experienced side effects. Tolerance at the injection site was good and safety tests did not show abnormalities. There were no differences between the two dosages. We conclude that this new depot-bromocriptine is a safe, well tolerated and effective drug in the suppression of prolactin and the prevention of post-partum lactation.\r"

Vitreous from lasered eyes inhibited the proliferation of cultured retinal microvascular endothelial cells in comparison with vitreous from non-lasered control eyes, and the inhibitory effect in the lasered eyes persisted for at least seven days. Inhibition was specific for endothelial cells, since no effect was observed when retinal pericytes or Tenon's fibroblasts were the target cells. These results suggest that indirect scatter photocoagulation may induce regression of neovascularisation by causing breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and thus releasing into the vitreous serum components which result in inhibition of retinal microvascular endothelial cell growth.\r"

Each survey consisted of clinical examinations of about 1800 individuals selected by a random cluster sampling technique in geographically distinct and culturally homogeneous rural areas; 13,803 examinations were completed in all. Together these surveys provide the basis for national estimates of the prevalence and aetiology of visual loss and ocular pathology. The results showed that 0.7% of rural Kenyans are blind in the better eye by WHO standards, and another 2.5% suffer significant visual impairment. Rates of visual loss tend to increase five-fold in each 20-year age cohort. Females have higher prevalence of visual loss than males over age 20, and certain geographical areas have markedly higher rates. The commonest cause of both blindness and visual impairment is cataract, accounting for 38% of all visual loss. Trachoma (a localised problem), glaucoma, macular degeneration, and severe refractive errors follow cataract as leading causes of blindness in the better eye. Trauma, corneal scars of various causes, phthisis, and staphyloma are important causes of monocular blindness. Nutritional eye disease does not appear to be a problem of any magnitude in rural Kenya.\r"

Person-time denominators have been used to compute age specific incidence rates (risk) of blindness from cataract for populations aged 35 and older. These age specific incidence measures have been applied to the 'population at risk' in each 5-year age class in order to estimate the total number of new cases of cataract blindness that occur in the country each year. The findings indicate that an estimated 3.8 million persons become blind from cataract each year in India (approximate 95% confidence limits: 3 to 4.5 million). The reasons why the estimates are considered as minima, and their implications concerning future national planning of ophthalmic services, are briefly discussed.\r"

After termination of therapy all 11 patients had a sustained remission of their eye disease. Unless subretinal neovascularisation was present, all had a final visual acuity of 20/50 or better. Malignancy has not developed in any of our cases, with a follow-up ranging from 6 months to 12 years (mean, 4.5 years). Although 30- and 40-year follow-ups and larger numbers of patients may be necessary fully to realise the risks of chlorambucil, we believe that our high-dose, short-term regimen (Behcet's disease: average duration, 23 weeks; average total dose 2.2 g; sympathetic ophthalmia: average duration, 11 weeks; total average dose, 0.9 g) may be safer than previously reported chlorambucil regimens of one to two years or longer.

Life table comparison showed no correlation between survival and location of tumour, sex of patient, size of tumour when treated, or laterality. There was a slight correlation between age and survival. Patients older than 60 died more frequently from metastatic melanoma than those under 60 (p = 0.06). Life table analysis showed a significant correlation between tumour regression type and survival.

Although a primary tumour was never found, histochemical and immunohistochemical studies of the enucleated eye suggested that the lesion originated in the gastrointestinal tract.

  ".W": "Twenty patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus were selected on the basis of morphological signs of blood-retinal barrier leakage--namely, hard exudates seen on fundus photographs and/or localised leakage of fluorescein seen on fluorescein angiograms. Computerised perimetry was carried out in visual field areas that corresponded to the morphological lesions, and the visual field data were accurately correlated with the morphology as seen on fundus photographs and fluorescein angiograms. In addition, in seven of the patients who represented the range of leakage among the patients studied, the blood-retinal barrier leakage was quantitated by vitreous fluorophotometry. In 16 cases normal light sensitivity was found in retinal areas showing localised leakage as studied on fluorescein angiograms. In four cases with pronounced maculopathy, where scotomata occurred, there was no topographical correlation between the scotomata and barrier leakage. Furthermore hard exudates often, but not consistently, caused localised scotomata when arranged in dense conglomerates. The permeability values correlated with angiographically observed hyperfluorescence in the macular area. On the basis of the techniques employed in the present study it seems that breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier is an earlier event than disturbance of neurosensory function in the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, the findings give no evidence of a causal relationship between barrier leakage and damage to sensory cell function.\r"

Specimens of less than four months' duration contained a significantly higher proportion of retinal pigment epithelial cells than later membranes. No association was found between membrane duration and the content of collagen subtypes I to IV and laminin, but 'early' specimens contained significantly more fibronectin than did 'late' membranes. Fibronectin and collagens I, III, and IV showed a variable relationship with glial cells and were most consistently associated with retinal pigment epithelial and fibroblast-like cells. These observations may explain some of the surgical features of epiretinal membranes.\r"

  ".W": "Diabetic and sickle retinopathy have features in common--for example, venous dilatation, microaneurysms, and capillary closure preceding neovascularisation. Bearing in mind that haemoglobin in poorly controlled diabetes is abnormal and that extremely low oxygen tensions (known to cause sickling) exist in the healthy cat retina, we wished to explore the possibility that diabetic blood, like that of sickle cell disease, may become more viscous when deoxygenated. To do this we measured whole blood viscosity, under oxygenated and deoxygenated conditions, of 23 normal persons, 23 diabetic patients without retinopathy, and 34 diabetic patients with retinopathy. The shear rate used was 230 s-1, which is similar to that thought to prevail in the major retinal veins. The viscosity of blood from normal persons, corrected for packed cell volume, did not change significantly on deoxygenation: mean 4.54 (SD 0.38) cps, versus, 4.57 (0.39) paired t test, p = 0.66. Similarly the blood from diabetics without retinopathy showed no change: 4.42 (0.45) versus 4.42 (0.30), p = 0.98; whereas the blood from patients with retinopathy changed from 4.82 (0.48) to 4.95 (0.63), p = 0.027. The hypoxic viscosity ratio (deoxygenated divided by oxygenated viscosity) correlated with total serum cholesterol (r = 0.44, p = 0.018) but not with HbA1, serum glucose, triglycerides, or age. A disproportionate increase in venous viscosity relative to arterial viscosity would lead to increased intraluminal and transmural pressure and therefore exacerbate leakage across capillary walls.\r"

The group mean age of these 'responders' (49.0 years) was significantly greater (p less than 0.005) than that of the non-responders (35.0). We recommend periodic measurements of corneal sensitivity in older patients receiving topical timolol or betaxolol, especially when given in higher concentrations, to identify responders, who may be at risk of developing keratitis.\r"

Chorioretinal neovascularisation (CRN) was a benign complication but may convert to choriovitreal neovascularisation (CVN). Late sequelae of CVN included vitreous haemorrhage, posterior vitreous face fibrosis, and tractional retinal detachment. Visual loss (of greater than or equal to 3 Snellen lines for greater than or equal to 3 months) occurred in nine eyes affected by choroidal neovascularisation, though because of other pathology this could not always be attributed to the choroidal neovascularisation. The incidence of visual loss in CVN affected eyes was significantly greater, by survival curve analysis, than in eyes affected by CRN alone. Permanent visual loss from tractional retinal detachment definitely attributable to CVN occurred in 2/35 (6%) eyes.\r"

The majority had retinochoroidal colobomata with optic nerve involvement, but only 13 patients had an iris defect. Two patients had atypical iris colobomata with normal fundi. Additional features were microphthalmos in 21 patients, optic nerve hypoplasia in four, nystagmus in 12, and a vertical disorder of eye movement in four of the 22 cases with facial palsy. We report an incidence of coloboma in the CHARGE association of 86% (43/50) compared with a previous cumulative reported incidence of 66% (112/170).

The assay we used allowed assessment of all three major isoenzymes, including the gamma gamma isoenzyme (neurone-specific enolase). No enolase was detectable in normal aqueous; alpha alpha isoenzyme was present in the aqueous of one patient with malignant melanoma, while aqueous from all patients with retinoblastoma contained both alpha alpha and gamma gamma. Normal serum contained only an alpha alpha band, while serum from patients with retinoblastoma contained alpha alpha, alpha gamma, and gamma gamma bands (7 sera, 87.5%), or alpha alpha only (1 patient, 12.5%). All sera from patients with malignant melanoma contained the alpha alpha band, with low levels of gamma gamma in 16 (60%). In a single patient with Coats's disease alpha alpha was present in the serum, but no enolase was detected in aqueous. Increased amounts of gamma-containing isoenzymes of enolase are found in both serum and aqueous from patients with retinoblastoma. In malignant melanoma there is often an increase in serum gamma gamma enolase. The assessment of aqueous and serum enolase patterns may be of value in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma and malignant melanoma.\r"

Many studies investigating HTLV seroprevalence and transmission have assumed that all seropositivity is due to HTLV type I (HTLV-I); recent data dispute this conclusion. We investigated the high prevalence of HTLV seropositivity in New Mexico by determining whether HTLV-I or HTLV-II is predominant in our donors. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of proviral DNA from peripheral blood, followed by sequence-specific hybridization with oligonucleotide probes to distinguish the two viruses, we demonstrate that 9 of 10 Western blot-confirmed HTLV-seropositive blood donors from New Mexico are infected with HTLV-II. Implications of this finding for donors and the safety of the blood supply are discussed.\r"

Doses of rhIL-3 ranged from 250 micrograms/m2 to 500 micrograms/m2 and were given as daily subcutaneous bolus injections for 15 days. Blood leucocyte counts increased 1.3- to 3.6-fold in all nine patients, including neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, basophils, and monocytes. The mean absolute neutrophil counts increased from 1,350/microL (range, 150 to 2,420) to 2,660/microL (range, 300 to 9,380) (P less than .05) immediately after the end of rhIL-3 therapy and to a maximum count of 4,096/microL (range, 350 to 10,820) (P less than .01). Platelet responses were seen in two of four profoundly thrombocytopenic patients, resulting in discontinuation of platelet transfusion. The requirements for red blood cell transfusion temporarily improved in one patient. Stimulation of plasma cells was evident by a significant increase in serum IgM and IgA levels. Mild side effects (fever, headache, local erythema, and bone pain) were observed in some patients, while transient thrombocytopenia developed in two patients. Disease progression with an increase in blast cells was seen in one patient. These results suggest that rhIL-3 is effective in stimulating hematopoiesis of all lineages in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and may produce at least short-term hematologic improvement.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-five patients with resistant acute leukemia or lymphoma received high-dose cyclophosphamide and etoposide to explore the activity of this combination in resistant hematologic malignancies, and to determine the maximum doses of these drugs that can be combined without bone marrow transplantation. Etoposide was administered over 29 to 69 hours by continuous infusion corresponding to total doses of 1.8 g/m2 to 4.8 g/m2. Cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/kg/d, was administered on 3 or 4 consecutive days total 150 to 200 mg/kg ideal body weight). At all dose levels myelosuppression was severe but reversible. Mucosal toxicity was dose-limiting with the maximum tolerated dose level combining etoposide 4.2 g/m2 with cyclophosphamide 200 mg/kg. Continuous etoposide infusion produced stable plasma levels that were lower than would be achieved after administration by short intravenous infusion, and this could explain our ability to escalate etoposide above the previously reported maximum tolerated dose. There were 28 complete (35%) and 12 partial (16%) responses. Median duration of complete response (CR) was 3.5 months (range 1.1 to 20+). Seventeen of 40 patients (42%) with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) achieved CR, including 6 of 20 (30%) with high-dose cytosine arabinoside resistance. We conclude that bone marrow transplantation is not required after maximum tolerated doses of etoposide and cyclophosphamide. This regimen is active in resistant hematologic neoplasms, and the occurrence of CR in patients with high-dose cytosine arabinoside-resistant AML indicates a lack of complete cross-resistance between these regimens.\r"

The median age was 40 years (range 16 to 57 years). The median interval between remission and ABMT was 5 months (range 1 to 12 months). Twenty-eight of these patients received a second course of the same high-dose chemotherapy and ABMT. The procedure related mortality rate was 6%. The projected leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years is 48% for all 82 patients and 50% for the 76 patients with no known preceding myelodysplastic syndrome. For those patients with primary AML who received a double ABMT the projected LFS is 67%. The interval between remission and ABMT did not predict for either relapse or LFS. ABMT using a multidrug chemotherapy protocol is less toxic than allogeneic BMT yet results in a similar LFS.\r"

Features associated with the presence of the Ph chromosome were high leukocyte count (median, 33 x 10(9)/L), older age median, 9.6 years), a higher proportion of French-American-British L2 morphology, and a lower frequency of mediastinal mass. Immunologic marker studies at diagnosis in 56 Ph+ cases identified early pre-B ALL in 42 cases (75%), pre-B-cell in 9 (16%), and T-cell in 5 (9%). This distribution is similar to that found in Ph+ ALL. Intensive multiagent chemotherapy induced complete remissions in only 78% of eligible Ph+ patients compared with 96% of those without an identified Ph chromosome (P less than .001). Of 44 eligible Ph+ patients treated on POG frontline protocols for children with non-T, non-B-cell ALL, 27 have failed therapy, compared with 520 of 1,892 without an identified Ph chromosome (logrank P less than .001). Ph+ ALL is an aggressive form of acute leukemia that frequently presents in older children with a high leukocyte count, FAB L2 morphology, and a pseudodiploid karyotype, and becomes multidrug-resistant early. Thus, Ph+ cases require early identification to permit treatment with intensive induction regimens and experimental approaches such as bone marrow transplantation.\r"

However, the decrease in platelets to one third of control was greater than the decreases in megakaryocyte indices, suggesting that thrombocytopoiesis was ineffective from days 3 through 7 post 5-FU. Megakaryocyte size began to recover on day 4, followed by polyploid DNA content on day 5, and megakaryocyte concentration and platelets at 7.5 days. Megakaryocyte size peaked on days 6 through 8 (1.25 x normal), followed by megakaryocyte polyploid DNA content on day 8, megakaryocyte concentration on days 9 through 12 (2 1/2 to 3x normal), and platelets on days 12 through 15 (2x normal). Platelet levels are thought to be important in the feedback regulation of megakaryocytes; however, only polyploid DNA content distributions showed a close inverse relationship to platelet counts during both the recovery and rebound thrombocytosis phases after 5-FU. In contrast, megakaryocyte size peaked before platelet recovery commenced, while megakaryocyte concentration increased in parallel with platelets from 7.5 to 10 days post 5-FU and continued to be maintained at 2 to 3 times normal through day 13, despite platelet levels that were more than twice normal. Both megakaryocyte size and polyploid DNA content distributions shifted toward lower values in response to the rebound thrombocytosis (DNA content on day 10 and size on days 12 and 13). Splenectomy did not substantially alter the pattern of post 5-FU rebound thrombocytosis or megakaryocyte response from that seen in intact mice, indicating that splenic megakaryocytes are not responsible for the prolonged thrombocytosis seen after this drug. In summary, the prolonged thrombocytosis after 5-FU administration results from failure to down-regulate the number of precursors entering the differentiating megakaryocyte compartment. These data indicate that megakaryocyte size and DNA content are responsive to different feedback controls than megakaryocyte concentration in this model system.\r"

  ".W": "Megakaryocyte development is a carefully controlled process that is at least partially regulated by cytokines. Previous investigations of megakaryocyte development have focused primarily on defining growth factors that induce or enhance differentiation. In this study we demonstrate that a specific cytokine, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1), inhibits the phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation of the Dami human megakaryocytic cell line. The addition of purified platelet TGF beta 1 inhibits PMA-induced endomitosis in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of endomitosis occurs with as little as 0.4 pmol/L TGF beta 1, is half-maximal at 6.4 pmol/L, and is maximal between 40 and 200 pmol/L TGF beta 1. Inhibition does not require other growth factors or nonmegakaryocytic cells. Removal of TGF beta 1 from the cultures decreases inhibition, suggesting that the continuous presence of TGF beta 1 is required and that its effects are reversible. This effect occurs even though the Dami cells constitutively express TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and the TGF beta 1 mRNA levels are increased by PMA. TGF beta 1 also has been shown to inhibit endomitosis during short-term culture of primary human megakaryocytes. These results suggest a model in which negative as well as positive regulatory factors modulate a critical stage of megakaryocyte development.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously demonstrated within intron 40 of the von Willebrand factor (vWF) gene a region of ATCT repeats that was shown to vary in length between two different DNA clones from unrelated individuals. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine the variability in length of this variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in 53 normal individuals, using primers to DNA sequence flanking the repeat region. Overall, eight different length allelic bands were seen. These were individually sequenced and shown to contain from 6 to 14 ATCT repeats (a nine-repeat band was not seen). Seventy-five percent of individuals were shown to be heterozygous for this vWF.VNTR, and family studies showed Mendelian inheritance with allelic frequencies from 1% (vWF.VNTR [8] and vWF.VNTR [14]) to 39% (vWF.VNTR [7]). In the family of a patient with type III severe von Willebrand disease (vWD), vWF.VNTR results mirrored the phenotypic data and results with previously reported intragenic vWF restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP). The patient was shown to be a compound heterozygote. In a family with a child with severe type III vWD, prenatal diagnosis by vWF.VNTR analysis on DNA obtained by chorionic villus sampling at 10 weeks gestation during a subsequent pregnancy indicated a severely affected fetus. This diagnosis was confirmed by fetal blood sampling at 18 weeks.\r"

To investigate whether CD5 B lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients display the same function, we fused B lymphocytes from 23 CD5+ B-CLL with nonsecreting murine myeloma X-63 cells. Hybrids were derived from 18 of the 23 patients, but only hybrids from 13 patients were found to secrete immunoglobulin (Ig) (IgM kappa 4, IgM lambda 8, and only kappa light chain 1). Supernatants of these hybrids were tested against an extensive panel of antigens by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination. At the same time, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 15 of these patients, including most patients from whom secreting hybrids had not been obtained, were stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Our results indicated that secreting heterohybrids from CLL B lymphocytes are frequently obtained; however, this is highly dependent on the light chain phenotype, since 8 of 9 lambda-expressing CLL produced hybrids secreting complete Igs, as compared with 4 of 12 kappa-expressing CLL. In addition, B lymphocytes of most patients from whom we failed to derive secreting hybrids also failed to secrete Ig on PMA stimulation. Secondly, CD5+ B-CLL lymphocytes were frequently committed to the production of natural autoantibodies, since in 8 of 15 cases (including hybrids and PMA stimulation) anti-Fc activity was found; three of these also displayed a multispecific binding pattern.\r"

Near-triploidy (66 to 73 chromosomes) was found in six cases and near-tetraploidy (82 to 94 chromosomes) in 20. A striking morphologic finding was the presence of clumped chromatin with grooved nuclei or Rieder cell formation in 20 cases. Other than a slight excess of the pre-B immunophenotype, the near-triploid cases did not appear to differ substantially from the general ALL population in clinical features. In contrast, near-tetraploid cases were more often associated with a T-cell immunophenotype (47% v 14%, P less than .001) and L2 morphology (30% v 22%, P less than .01), and were older at diagnosis (median age, 8.6 v 4.8 years, P = .01) than cases with other ploidies. Moreover, an unusually high proportion of near-tetraploid cases tested (6 of 15) expressed one or more of the myeloid-associated antigens CD13, CD15, and CD33. Despite the use of contemporary intensive chemotherapy and short follow-up for most patients, 6 of the 20 near-tetraploid cases have relapsed or died. This study suggests that the near-tetraploid subtype differs from other cases of hyperdiploid greater than 50 ALL, which have been associated with a favorable prognosis.\r"

In a rare variant form of X-CGD, cytochrome b558 is present but not functional. The gene (locus symbol CYBB) was localized to band Xp21 by studies of patients with small chromosome deletions. The gene was cloned based on its location and found to encode the 91-Kd subunit of the cytochrome b558 complex. Most female carriers for X-CGD can be identified by their X-inactivation mosaicism; on average 50% of their neutrophils express the mutant phenotype and fail to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT). In 2 of 4 families studied, the maternal grandmothers had normal NBT tests, suggesting either nonrandom X-inactivation or new mutations. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using closely linked flanking markers or the NsiI polymorphism detected by the CYBB probe itself, allowed us to identify the X chromosome carrying the mutation as derived from a healthy NBT-positive maternal grandfather. The mothers of the affected boys must have received a paternal X chromosome carrying a new mutation, consistent with the maternal grandmothers' normal NBT tests. In all of eight potential carriers studied, the results of the NBT and DNA marker testing were in complete agreement. Prenatal diagnosis by DNA testing can be performed in early gestation obviating the need for fetal blood sampling.\r"

This diagnostic method precludes the need for radioisotopes, electrophoresis, and multiple high-stringency reaction conditions. The multiplicity of mutant globin genes present in Southeast Asians complicates clinical diagnosis and underscores the importance of DNA-based diagnostic methods. We have applied CCA to distinguish beta A and beta E alleles. Competing 15mer primers were a fluorescein-labeled complement to beta A and a rhodamine-labeled complement to beta E, identical except for their central nucleotides. A common unlabeled primer was used to amplify DNA product, the color of which was determined by the perfectly complementary primer. Color photography and spectrofluorometry, as well as a method of black-white photography that we developed to distinguish fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled DNA, were used to record results. We applied CCA to define the complex genotype of a Thai woman with thalassemia intermedia, 96% HbE, and 4% HbF whose possible genotypes included several permutations of alpha-thalassemia, beta-thalassemia, and beta E genes. zeta-Globin gene mapping of DNA doubly digested with Bg/II and Asp 718 showed the -alpha 3.7/--SEA genotype, and CCA confirmed homozygous beta E/beta E. The CCA is useful for diagnosing the compound hemoglobin genotypes of Southeast Asians and could be applied also to prenatal diagnosis in this population.\r"

  ".W": "Recognized manifestations of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract include secretory diarrhea, abdominal pain, and, at times, hemorrhage. In a review of 469 patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from matched sibling donors at our institution, we have recognized a syndrome of upper GI GVHD. This syndrome, presenting clinically as anorexia, dyspepsia, food intolerance, nausea, and vomiting, was recognized and confirmed histologically in 62 patients (13% by Kaplan-Meier projection) at the initiation of systemic GVHD therapy, a subset of the 197 patients developing grade II through IV GVHD. These 62 patients with upper GI GVHD were significantly older than the overall BMT population and older than the cohort with grade II through IV GVHD, as well. Of the 62 patients, 25 had upper GI GVHD accompanied only by limited (stage 1 and 2) skin GVHD; 13 others with upper GI GVHD plus limited skin involvement at initial presentation later progressed to more extensive multiorgan involvement; 24 others presented with upper GI along with other organ GVHD. This upper GI GVHD syndrome, first recognized at our center in 1983, has been diagnosed with increasing frequency (22% +/- 5%) in the most recent 5-year interval. The upper GI GVHD syndrome is more responsive to immunosuppressive therapy than grade II GVHD defined by Seattle criteria, with complete and continuing responses to treatment observed in 71% +/- 17% (95% confidence interval) of those with the upper GI GVHD syndrome compared with only 37% +/- 10% complete responses in other patients with grade II GVHD (P = .002). Patients failing immunosuppressive therapy for upper GI GVHD often progress to symptomatic lower GI involvement, suggesting that this syndrome may be an earlier and perhaps more treatable manifestation of this unique intestinal immunopathology, which is followed by chronic GVHD in 74% of patients. While upper GI GVHD symptoms are nonspecific and require invasive histologic and microbiologic studies to confirm the diagnosis, we believe this syndrome has been underreported after allogeneic BMT and propose its recognition within the clinical GVHD scoring system.\r"

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Pancreatic necrosis proved histologically--that is, greater than 30 g necrotic tissue debrided at laparotomy (for life threatening sepsis or peritonitis) or necropsy. RESULTS--Dynamic computed tomography correctly localised pancreatic necrosis in 11 patients (confirmed at laparotomy in nine and at necropsy in two). Of nine patients with low enhancement of peripancreatic tissues alone, eight recovered after conservative management; necropsy confirmed viable pancreas and necrosis of peripancreatic fat in one patient. Of 40 patients with normal contrast enhancement, none required laparotomy to debride pancreatic necrosis. CONCLUSION--Dynamic contrast enhanced computed tomography seems to be a safe and accurate method of identifying and localising pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis, which cannot be predicted accurately by conventional imaging techniques.\r"

PATIENTS--27 Women with unexplained infertility (average age 33.2); median duration of infertility five years. A control group of 44 women with normal fertility (average age 33.8) who were requesting sterilisation or reversal of sterilisation. SETTING--Infertility clinic, Jessop Hospital for Women, Sheffield. INTERVENTION--Secretory phase endometrial biopsy specimens were taken, with informed consent, as an outpatient procedure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibody D9B1, was used to assess the production and secretion of an oligosaccharide epitope produced by endometrial gland cells between two and seven days after the luteinising hormone surge. A reflected light measuring system was used to assess the amount of epitope within the gland cells, and in the gland lumen. RESULTS--In the control group of women, mean reflected light measurements at the cell base and cell apex peaked at three and five days after the luteinising hormone surge respectively, and in the gland lumen the epitope accumulated rapidly from three days, reaching a peak at seven days. In the women with infertility the peaks of epitope at the cell base and cell apex were lower, broader, and delayed in onset, and the build up of epitope in the gland lumen was retarded. The synthesis and secretion of the epitope in the women with infertility was therefore significantly reduced and delayed, even in the presence of normal concentrations of circulating progesterone. CONCLUSIONS--The results suggest that a primary dysfunction of the endometrium might be associated with hitherto unexplained infertility.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective study of consecutively recruited patients with cancer and other groups by questionnaire; half of the patients received the questionnaire again three months after starting treatment. SETTING--A medical oncology ward of a London teaching hospital. SUBJECTS--106 Patients with newly diagnosed solid tumours referred to the unit for consideration of treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy, 100 of whom were able to complete the questionnaire. 100 Matched controls, 315 cancer doctors (238 radiotherapists and 77 medical oncologists), 1500 randomly chosen general practitioners, and 1000 randomly chosen cancer nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Percentage chance of cure, prolonging life, or palliation of symptoms required to make treatment worth while with two hypothetical chemotherapy treatments, with severe and mild side effects respectively. RESULTS--Respondents to the questionnaire comprised 100 patients, 100 controls, 60 (78%) medical oncologists, 88 (37%) radiotherapists, 790 (53%) general practitioners, and 303 (30%) cancer nurses. Most patients were willing to accept intensive chemotherapy for a very small chance of benefit. The median benefit required to make the hypothetical intensive treatments worth while for patients compared with controls were: for chance of a cure (range 1 to 100%) 1% v 50%, for prolonging life (range three months to five years) 12 months v 24-60 months, and for relief of symptoms (range 1 to 100%) 10% v 75% respectively. There were no significant differences in the responses of the 50 patients completing the questionnaire on a second occasion. Doctors and nurses were less likely to accept radical treatment for minimal benefit compared with the patients (median scores 10-50%, 12-24 months, and 50-75%, for chance of cure, prolonging life, and relief of symptoms respectively). Significantly more patients than controls accepted treatments giving the minimal benefit for each category (cure 53.1 v 19.0%, 67.0 v 35.0%; prolonging life 42.1 v 10.0%, 53.0 v 25.0%; relief of symptoms 42.6 v 10.0%, 58.7 v 19.0% for intensive and mild treatments respectively, p less than 0.001) as was the case for comparison of patients with other groups. CONCLUSION--Patients with cancer are much more likely to opt for radical treatment with minimal chance of benefit than people who do not have cancer, including medical and nursing professionals. This could be taken into account when discussing treatment options with patients and their relatives.\r"

The probe/restriction enzyme combinations used were the 4.6 kb 5' fragment of the A1AT gene with the Sst I enzyme, the 6.5 kb 3' fragment of the same gene with Taq I and the 3.4 kb fragment of A1ACT with Taq I. The frequency of homozygous genotype for the 5.8 kb A1ACT band was increased in osteoarthritis (62.8% versus 36.8%, P = 0.01, relative risk = 2.9, aetiological fraction = 0.41). No other disease association was found with any marker. This suggests that the A1ACT gene may influence susceptibility to generalized osteoarthritis.\r"

The majority of sera reacted against only one or two peptides and antibodies to the CB-10 and CB-11 peptides were those most commonly found. However, some sera reacted with up to eight peptides, indicating that patients had antibodies to differing combinations of epitopes on type II collagen. Examination of sequential serum samples from an individual patient showed that there were changes in the class of antibody produced to type II collagen and that antibodies to different peptides were preferentially produced at different times in the course of the disease. Thus there was a selective response to different peptides of type II collagen not only between patients but also at different times in the course of disease in the same patient.\r"

Sacroiliac joint films of 20 consecutive patients with BS were mixed with those of 20 consecutive control patients and read blindly and independently by two observers. Six patients with BS met the New York criteria for sacroiliitis. Of the control patients, one had monolateral grade 1 sacroiliitis and two revealed findings consistent with osteitis condensans ilii. CT confirmed the diagnosis of sacroiliitis in patients with BS showing a high degree in at least one joint. The results of the present study suggest that the use of CT for BS patients showing sacroiliac joint changes on pelvic plain films may limit the confusion which exists about this finding in BS.\r"

No association was found between the presence of gastric Helicobacter pylori and either oesophageal ulceration or histological oesophagitis. Patients receiving NSAIDs, especially those with a hiatus hernia, are at risk of oesophageal ulceration and presumably subsequent stricture formation.

Differences were also apparent in the organization of clinics, provision of follow-up appointments for different diagnostic groups, and usage of steroid injections.

It was found that 16/66 (24%) patients who were offered surgery after DCG refused it or were assessed as unfit for surgery, demonstrating the need for careful counselling and assessment of patients prior to investigation. The presence of lacrimal system obstruction on DCG was an important factor in determining whether a patient underwent lacrimal surgery. However, the actual level of the obstruction influenced neither the likelihood of a patient undergoing lacrimal surgery nor the form of lacrimal surgery undertaken. This suggests that, unless the surgical approach will be modified in the light of the anatomical information furnished by DCG, DCG is not necessary. Lacrimal scintigraphy would provide sufficient information for the practical management of epiphora. Syringing of the lacrimal system correlates poorly with DCG in detecting obstruction.\r"

In order to determine the value of induction CT for such patients, we conducted a retrospective study: 121 patients were treated with CT and radiotherapy (RT) (Group 1). This group was compared with a historical group of 84 patients treated by RT alone (Group 2). The CT used was Cisplatinum associated with Bleomycin and Vincristin or Vindesin and with 5 Fluoro-uracil. An objective response to CT was observed for 41% of patients. The 5 year actuarial survival rate was 19% for Group 1 and 24% for Group 2. Patterns of failure were identical in the two groups. The only difference observed was for patients with N3 nodes (26% of 5 year survival rate in Group 1 versus 9% in Group 2) (p = 0.05). The results did not depend on the histological differentiation, the tumour site or the type of CT. We conclude that this retrospective study failed to demonstrate an advantage for induction CT in oropharynx carcinoma except for patients with N3 nodes.\r"

By securing a silicone gel-filled implant (breast prosthesis) in the tumour bed after excision of the tumour, adjacent viscera are displaced from the site of maximum irradiation and may thereby be protected. We used this technique in three patients in whom excision of a retroperitoneal sarcoma was followed by high-dose adjuvant radiotherapy. Post-operative radiotherapy was well tolerated but local recurrence developed in one patient, and delayed perforation of the large bowel occurred in another. Both cases underwent further surgery at which the implant was removed. The same two cases also developed asymptomatic hydronephrosis on the side of the implant, attributed to local fibrosis.\r"

In 28 kidneys (7%), the IVU was abnormal when the 99Tcm DMSA was normal. There was a collecting system abnormality in 27 kidneys, but 10 kidneys also showed a parenchymal abnormality. In all these the parenchymal abnormality was global thinning on the IVU, and the contralateral kidney was small. In 40 kidneys (10%) the 99Tcm DMSA was abnormal when the IVU was normal: the abnormalities demonstrated were predominantly focal defects. After excluding IVUs of poor diagnostic quality, only 14 kidneys (3.6%) showed this disparity. The important clinical subgroups are infection, with or without reflux (27 kidneys), hypertension (4) and neonates with poor renal function (2). The one false positive 99Tcm DMSA was a result of an anatomical variant. Global thinning in a \"normal\" kidney on a 99Tcm DMSA scan may be overlooked when the contralateral kidney is poorly functioning and small.\r"

Tumours were located in the extremities (11 patients), abdomen or pelvis (six patients) and the chest (five patients). The tumours ranged in size from 2 cm to 20 cm, were mainly well circumscribed and showed no evidence of calcification prior to treatment. Most tumours (13 out of 14) were of low attenuation or contained areas of lower attenuation than muscle on computed tomographic examination, and in six out of seven patients studied by ultrasound the tumours were hypoechoic or partly anechoic. No distinctive post-contrast medium enhancement pattern on CT examination (11 patients) or angiographic features (three patients) were evident. Tumour haemorrhage was a frequent microscopic finding and changes consistent with this were present in one patient on magnetic resonance imaging examination. Distant metastases or local recurrence developed in 13 patients with lung being the most frequent metastatic site (eight patients). Although its radiological features are non-specific, extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of noncalcified soft-tissue tumours especially in a young age group and where located in an extremity or paravertebral region of the chest.\r"

In general, zinc aspartate was more effective than the other organic zinc salts. Protection of the haematocrit and thrombocytes by small doses of the aminothiol radioprotector WR 2721 was markedly improved by the concomitant administration of small doses of zinc aspartate. Zinc aspartate was the only one of the four tested organic zinc salts that did not inhibit in any instance the regression induced by radiotherapy of human tumours grown as xenografts in immunosuppressed mice. This also applied to the combination of zinc aspartate with WR 2721. In an experiment performed to determine the toxicity of the combined regimen, a dose of zinc aspartate which afforded synergistic haematological protection did not enhance the toxicity of WR 2721. The synergism of zinc aspartate with WR 2721 and the differential radioprotection of the combined protocol may make it possible in clinical cancer radiotherapy to obtain selective radioprotection at a lower toxicity giving an improved therapeutic ratio compared with WR 2721 alone.\r"

We used data from a recent national survey of 2398 Canadian physicians to examine differences between women and men in their practices and their attitudes toward health care issues. Significant differences were found in the organization and management of the practices. Women preferred group over solo practice and were overrepresented in community health centres, health service organizations and centres locaux de services communautaires in Quebec. One-third of the women, as compared with half of the men, were in specialties. Even after adjusting for differences in workloads the incomes of the women were significantly lower than those of the men. Only minor differences were observed in the assessment of the health care system and alternative modes of organizing health care services. We believe that the differences were due to the double workload of women as professionals and family caregivers and the powerful socialization effects of medical education. As women overcome their minority status in the medical profession, differences between the sexes may become more apparent. Thus, the extent and effects of the progressive increase in the number of women in Canadian medicine should be assessed on an ongoing basis.\r"

A prospective series comprising 101 patients with fresh fractures treated by closed reduction and internal fixation was included in a roentgenographic follow-up study. The single most important factor was the quality of reduction, followed by the type of fracture, and the position of the internal fixation material. Age, gender, and type of internal fixation device (three screws or three nails) were not found to influence the healing complication rate. The predicted probability of a healing complication for different combinations of the three most important factors ranged from 0.05 to 0.99. The highest value was found for the combination Garden Type IV fracture, which had unacceptable reduction and position of the internal fixation material. The results show that failure to achieve adequate reduction should be a strong argument in favor of primary hip arthroplasty.\r"

One patient was treated with only the curretage and strut graft. The functional results were excellent (five), good (one), and fair (one), with no local recurrence. In treating fibrous dysplasia, dysplastic bone should be supplemented with grafts of cortical bone. This construct provides increased strength and prevents deformity and fracture, but it does not eradicate the disease. Internal fixation promotes union of the cortical graft to the host cancellous bone. The sliding screw stabilizes the bone and eliminates the need for plaster casts.\r"

Embalmed pelves from anatomic specimens were used to conduct paired tests between designs that showed large differences in insertional torque to failure in foam. The quality of the initial fixation in foam was found to be dependent on the design features of the components. Components with widely spaced, deep threads, and minimal thread interruptions offered the strongest initial fixation in foam. Tests in bone revealed a wide range of fixation strengths reflecting the variability in bone quality. No differences in fixation strength attributable to component design were observed in bone. When the insertional failure torque was greater than 60 N.m, one-half of the pelves fractured, and these fractures occurred with all designs. At failure torques less than 60 N.m, failure was predominantly due to thread strippage of the screw, with only two of 20 specimens experiencing pelvic fracture.\r"

The mean age was 29.9 years (range, 14-52 years). Each patient had tenderness over the joint line with a palpable mass. There were 25 cases of meniscal cysts, with one patient having a bilateral cyst. Twenty-two cysts involved the lateral meniscus, and three cysts were on the medial side of the knee. The follow-up period ranged from 16 to 48 months (mean, 33.5 months). All patients had a meniscal tear; most tears were either horizontal or transverse, with or without flap formation. The pathology was in the middle or anterior one-third of the meniscus. The arthroscopic surgery consisted of partial excision of the meniscal tear, leaving a peripheral rim at times, coupled with aspiration of the cyst material or manipulation of its contents into the joint cavity. No cyst recurred, and in every patient except one, preoperative symptoms disappeared. All patients but one were satisfied with the results. Two patients had a second arthroscopy, and no evidence of instability of the peripheral rim was found.\r"

On the first postoperative morning, the popliteal and pedal pulses were absent. An arteriogram identified complete occlusion of the distal superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery down to and including the trifurcation. After a right femoral artery embolectomy, the pulses returned and the patient suffered no residual deficit from the arterial occlusion. The patient had a prior history of prostatic carcinoma and was taking diethylstilbestrol; these factors, along with age-associated atherosclerotic disease and the tourniquet application, created a favorable environment for such a rare complication.

For static reconstruction a procedure involving the distal part of the peroneus brevis tendon was used. The bore holes in the lateral malleolus were placed at the insertions of the original ligaments. For dynamic reconstruction the anterior one-half of the peroneus brevis tendon was used. On muscular contraction the split tendon will slide through a bore canal in the lateral malleolus. Theoretically, both procedures can stabilize the ankle and subtalar joint. Fifty-six patients were assigned to static reconstruction and, because of thin tendons, only 26 were assigned to dynamic reconstruction. Thirty-three cases had increased subtalar mobility. All patients had standardized clinical and roentgenographic examinations preoperatively and at nine and 25 months postoperatively. At the 25-month follow-up examinations the clinical results were best in Group S. The number of reinjuries was highest in Group D, and two patients had given up sports. The inversion movement was most restricted in Group S but without functional importance. A significant reduction of talar tilting and anterorotational talar displacement was seen in both groups but was most pronounced in Group S. Also, postural balance improved in both groups. Complications in Group S were venous thrombosis in two patients, dysesthesia in the cicatrix in two, hyposensibility of the lateral foot edge in one, and calcification at one bore hole in one patient. Complications in Group D were hyposensibility and dysesthesia in the cicatrix in one patient. The static procedure is recommended for reconstruction of chronically unstable ankles, especially if associated with increased subtalar mobility.\r"

Fifty percent of the patients with culture-proven joint-space infections had synovial fluid leukocyte counts below 28,000/mm3. Comparison of this investigation with previous studies of similar magnitude demonstrates a striking difference in the mean and median synovial fluid white cell counts. The population reviewed had a higher incidence of patients with potentially immunocompromising medical conditions than previous reports. Similarities between this and previous reports include predisposing conditions, the spectrum of pathogens cultured, associated clinical findings on admission, hospital course, and mortality. The data presented here document the magnitude of potential overlap between the synovial fluid leukocytosis in infected joints and in joints afflicted with other forms of inflammatory arthropathy. Three patients populations (malignant neoplasms, steroid use, and intravenous drug abuse) with positive cultures from synovial fluid aspirates but initial synovial fluid white cell counts averaging below 50,000 cells/mm3 were identified. Patients with moderate synovial fluid leukocytosis, especially those potentially immunocompromised, must be considered to have infectious arthritis unless other causes of inflammatory arthropathies are demonstrated.\r"

The result of immunohistochemical staining (ABC method) showed that BMP is distributed along collagen fibers of normal bone, in periosteal cells, and in mesenchymal cells of marrow stroma. Little BMP can be found in bone cells of lamellar bone or in calcified bone matrix. BMP may be abundant in human tooth anlagen such as predentin, cells of the outer and inner enamel epithelium, and cells of dental sac generating bone. BMP is found in the cytoplasm of tumor cells of osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. Immunohistochemical staining showed that BMP plays a role in bone fracture healing. The ability of BMP-McAb to detect BMP and to inhibit the generation of new bone also makes it potentially useful in diagnosing, treating, and providing a prognosis for osteosarcoma and other bone diseases.\r"

The cause, whether by abnormal tension or incorrect use, development, and progression to chronic tendinopathy, as well as measures to prevent it, were analyzed in 19 cases. The methods of treatment, including conservative treatment with rest and refraining from dancing, local treatment such as ice and adhesive strapping, antiinflammatory drugs, local injections, thermotherapy, and laser therapy, were compared, and the time of recovery and ability to resume dancing were evaluated. Two cases required surgical treatment to subside, and the patients had to retire from professional dancing. The roentgenographic diagnosis of stage and progression of the tendinopathy is emphasized as a valuable accessory sign. The similarity in lesions between Achilles and patellar tendon problems was observed and confirmed.\r"

There were no detectable effects on the microvascular blood flow during the 60 minutes of observation for chondroitinase ABC or the control. A therapeutic concentration (2000 pKat/ml) of chymopapain stopped the microcirculation in the injected area immediately, with numerous microbleedings at the border zone. Long-term effects were studied after subcutaneous injections in the ears of six rabbits. Chondroitinase ABC and the control did not cause any macroscopic or microangiographic effects. However, light microscopy showed a moderate inflammatory reaction in the subcutaneous layer for both chondroitinase ABC and the control. Chymopapain induced severe effects on the cartilage and surrounding tissues. Microangiography revealed a vessel-free zone at the injection site. Since 200 units/ml of chondroitinase ABC is four to eight times higher than the concentration that might be used for chemonucleolysis, i.e., dissolution of intervertebral discs by local enzyme injection, the present investigation suggests a wide margin of safety regarding the potential effects on blood vessels in tissues surrounding the disc.\r"

The DBM was allotransplanted heterotopically into growing rats. New bone formation was induced in and around the implants. The new bone formation was accompanied by a decrease in the content of 3H; 20 and 30 days after implantation, 72% and 46%, respectively, of the activity remained in the implants. Daily injections of indomethacin (2 mg/kg) inhibited calcium uptake by about 20% at 20 and 30 days and inhibited the release of 3H from the DBM to a similar degree. Heterotopic bone induction by DBM is accompanied by matrix resorption, and inhibition of the new bone formation decreases the resorption of DBM.\r"

  ".W": "The vascular repair of a lower tibial transverse osteotomy in the New Zealand white rabbit held in an external fixator was studied in three groups. In the first group, composed of 18 animals, the osteotomy gap was maintained throughout repair. Three animals were killed every two weeks up to 12 weeks postoperatively. In the second group, composed of three animals killed at six weeks, the fragments were brought into contact. In a third and similar group, the osteotomy was compressed. Plain roentgenograms were taken weekly, and intraarterial perfusion with Micropaque was performed when the animals were killed. Roentgenography using fine-grain film, microradiography, and histology were carried out on a midsagittal tibial slice. The results showed that following transverse osteotomy in which the gap was maintained, vascular union of the proximal and distal cortices and associated external callus masses had usually occurred by ten weeks postoperatively. However, an occasional hypovascular zone at the osteotomy site at 12 weeks was associated with fibrous delayed union. In contrast, when apposition or compression of the fragments was used, repair was accelerated, and cortical bone union was established at six weeks. Vascular union of the fragments occurred predominantly through the medullary vessels. The results emphasize the overriding clinical importance of abolition of a fracture gap to achieve rapid revascularization of a fracture and its union by bone.\r"

Research programs aimed at selecting preferred treatment methods are currently underway by a host of organizations, including the Rand Corporation and the American Medical Association, private sector insurers, and agencies of the federal government.

Since that time, several groups within orthopedics have discussed various methods for enhancing the educational nature of fellowships as they related to orthopedic residency programs. The orthopedic community as a whole has concurred about the concept of accrediting fellowships, ensuring a minimum standard educational quality, and keeping the growth of fellowships in some areas from adversely affecting the educational quality of a residency program. When fellowships are accredited, standards are created, such as the requirement that a fellowship must last at least one year, and depending on the area of specialization, include both research and clinical work. Certification and accreditation are separate issues. Certification is the process of credentialing individual physicians as specialists and is the responsibility of a specialty board. Accreditation is the process of identifying residency and fellowship programs that meet published educational standards and is the responsibility of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the corresponding Residency Review Committee. There is little question that the educational process that occurs during a fellowship can have a beneficial effect on the learning process of residents and vice versa.\r"

The autocratic dogmatic certification by the decreed blessing of the department chair must give way to objective examination by impartial boards. There are too many differences now to establish an international certifying process, but everyone must encourage and work toward common professional, educational, political, national, and economic goals so that eventually such certifying might be possible. Dialogue between boards in the United States and analogous bodies in other countries (such as colleges of surgeons) to nurture the definition of necessary core knowledge, standardize examination design and technique, and eventually develop reciprocity for requirements to take examinations should also be encouraged.\r"

Localization was lumbar in ten cases, thoracic and lumbar in two, and thoracic or cervical in 14. Abscesses were present in 15 (57%) subjects and appeared during treatment in 20% of these cases. They were twice as frequent in non-Swiss patients. Three patients had surgery because of progression of the abscess under treatment. Ten cases needed single or multiple aspirations. Three of six lumbar abscesses were initially visualized only by computed tomography. Neurologic complications occurred in 12 (46%) patients, 11 of whom had cervical or thoracic vertebrae involved. In four cases (33%), the neurologic deficit developed during the first two months of treatment. Three patients had laminectomies, two without any benefit. Outcome was favorable for 11 of 12 patients without any difference between conservative treatment and surgery. Neurologic symptoms are in most cases related to radicular and medullary inflammation, with arachnoiditis and without compression. The possible benefit of steroids seems promising enough to warrant further investigation.\r"

Bipolar surface and intramuscular fine-wire electrodes were used, and the EMG signal was low-pass filtered, full-wave rectified, and time-averaged. Activity from the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, pectoralis major (sternoclavicular part), the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the deltoid, and the latissimus dorsi was recorded in parallel. In order to allow a comparison of the activity in a subject's different muscles and the activity in specific muscles between different individuals, the EMG was normalized. Muscle activity occurred simultaneously in muscles producing the movement and in antagonistic muscles. Coordination due to muscle contractions plays a significant role in stabilizing the shoulder joint. The infraspinatus, subscapularis, and latissimus dorsi acted as stabilizers during flexion; the subscapularis acted as a stabilizer during external rotation and with the supraspinatus during extension.\r"

A group of 100 children with pulled elbows, composed of 64 girls and 36 boys with a mean age of 25.5 months, and their parents were checked for joint hypermobility in a prospective study over a period of two years. Results were compared with a normal (non-pulled elbow) control group of 30 children. The prevalence of hypermobility among children with pulled elbow was 73%, which is 23% higher than in normal children of similar age. The main differences in hypermobility between the groups were noted in elbows and knees. There was no significant difference between girls and boys. In 48% of the cases of children with pulled elbows, at least one of the parents had hypermobility, whereas only in 10% of the control group were parents hypermobile. The association between pulled elbow and hypermobility indicates that pulled elbow can be considered one of the effects of this condition. Since not all patients with pulled elbows were hypermobile nor did they have parents with hypermobility, other factors may be relevant, such as variations in the anatomy of the radial head and surrounding structures in combination with the degree of violence involved.\r"

  ".W": "The pharmacokinetics of imipenem were studied in 11 adult patients with severe burns who were receiving a therapeutic regimen of imipenem-cilastatin 500 mg intravenously every 6 hours. Serial blood samples for measuring imipenem and 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance (CrCl) were obtained after the initial dose and after multiple dosing. Plasma was assayed for imipenem by use of HPLC. A two-compartment model provided a superior fit to the data compared with a one-compartment model in 9 of the 11 patients. There was no significant difference in any pharmacokinetic parameter between the initial dose and after multiple dosing (p greater than 0.05). Combined mean (+/- SD) parameter estimates for the two dosing periods were as follows: VC, 0.11 +/- 0.06 L/kg; Vss, 0.22 +/- 0.06 L/kg; CL, 12.5 +/- 3.6 L/hr/1.73 m2; t1/2 alpha, 0.18 +/- 0.13 hr; t1/2 beta, 1.12 +/- 0.44 hr. Mean clearance in two patients with creatinine clearance values greater than 150 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 17.7 L/hr/1.73 m2. Mean clearance in two patients with creatinine clearance values less than 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 was 8.5 L/hr/1.73 m2. No pharmacokinetic parameter was significantly different from previously reported parameters in normal volunteers (p greater than 0.05). Creatinine clearance ranged from 17 to 218 ml/min/1.73 m2. Imipenem clearance was significantly related to creatinine clearance (CL = 63 + 0.059 CLCR; r2 = 0.60, p = 0.001). No significant association was found between total body surface area burns and imipenem clearance (p greater than 0.05). Our data suggest imipenem pharmacokinetics in patients with burns are comparable to those in normal volunteers although substantial intersubject variability exists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Steady-state clearance was calculated from dopamine concentration in arterial blood. Dopamine clearance was 60.7 +/- 28.1 ml/kg/min. The age of the patient exerted an effect on clearance of dopamine (r = -0.63; p less than 0.05), and dopamine clearance was nearly twice as rapid in children younger than 2 years as it was in older children (82.3 +/- 27.7 ml/kg/min versus 45.9 +/- 17.0 mg/kg/min). Conjugated bilirubin exerted an age-independent effect on clearance of dopamine; clearance was 44.8 +/- 28.6 ml/kg/min in children with abnormal conjugated bilirubin (greater than or equal to 0.9 mg/dl) and 70.1 +/- 2.56 ml/kg/min in children with normal conjugated bilirubin (less than 0.9 mg/dl). Clearance was lowest (29.8 +/- 5.7 ml/kg/min) in the four children who had both hepatic and renal dysfunction. Age is an important determinant of dopamine clearance, explaining in part the clinical observation that infants and young children require higher infusion rates.\r"

Our preliminary observations suggested that heparin was inactivated in the extracorporeal circuit during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. We tested this hypothesis by comparing heparin pharmacokinetics in five infants during extracorporeal circulation with kinetics, respectively determined in each patient and in the isolated circuit immediately after discontinuation of the procedure. Heparin clearance was 1.6 +/- 0.5 ml/kg/min in the patient and 2.1 +/- 0.8 ml/kg/min in the separated circuit. In each patient, the total of heparin clearances in the patient and circuit, 3.7 +/- 1.0 ml/kg/min, was virtually identical with the heparin clearance during the procedure, 3.8 +/- 1.9 ml/kg/min (r = 0.94, p less than 0.01). We conclude that more than one half of the heparin administered to infants during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is eliminated by the extracorporeal circuit itself or by blood components in the circuit. These data explain the relatively large heparin doses needed to maintain anticoagulation in infants during extracorporeal circulation. In light of these findings, a reexamination of the normal mechanisms of elimination of heparin activity appears to be warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Although circulating bradykinin increases during surgery, concentrations remain unknown in the biologically relevant compartment, the inflamed tissue. We have developed a new method, using microdialysis probes, for collecting tissue samples of immunoreactive bradykinin in both postoperative patients and rats injected with carrageenan. In vitro studies determined optimal flow rate, that dialysate levels of immunoreactive bradykinin were linearly related to external concentrations, and that the probes do not activate bradykinin synthesis. In oral surgery patients, tissue levels of immunoreactive bradykinin peaked approximately 3 hours after surgery. Preoperative administration of methylprednisolone (125 mg) reduced immunoreactive bradykinin levels by 62% (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo. Comparison of bradykinin levels to concurrent pain revealed a counterclockwise hysteresis, suggesting a delay between peak levels of bradykinin in the effect compartment and pain. In rats, dexamethasone suppressed tissue levels of immunoreactive bradykinin. The glucocorticoid suppression was dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Microdialysis appears to be a novel and useful method for measuring the peripheral release of bradykinin and, possibly, other inflammatory mediators.\r"

We compared acetylator status in 36 Chinese women with mild, stable, and confirmed lupus erythematosus and 36 healthy control subjects matched for age, sex, and ethnic origin. Acetylator status was determined by use of HPLC to assay 5-acetylamino-6-formylamino-3-methyluracil/methylxanthine (AFMU/MX) and AFMU/(AFMU + MX) ratios in urine 1 to 4 hours after drinking a strong cup of coffee (caffeine). By use of parametric and nonparametric methods of analysis, the frequency distribution of AFMU/MX and AFMU/(AFMU + MX) ratios in both the patients and control subjects were determined to be very similar. Thus there was no association between slow acetylator status and lupus erythematosus in the study subjects.\r"

In the serum of patients with active disease we observed increased proportions of concanavalin A nonreactive and concanavalin A weakly reactive fractions. The results were expressed as the ratio of concanavalin A non-reactive fraction plus concanavalin A weakly reactive fraction to concanavalin A reactive fraction, called R alpha 1-ACT. An R alpha 1-ACT higher than 1.8 (upper normal value) was found in 30/31 sera from patients with active disease (sensitivity 97%) and in 2/22 sera from patients with inactive disease (specificity 91%). 3. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the serum C-reactive protein level, common markers of biological inflammation, are usually elevated in active giant-cell arteritis and/or polymyalgia rheumatica. The two parameters are commonly used to guide the therapy during the course of the disease, but they have no specificity. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate of greater than 30 mm/h was found in 30/31 sera from patients with active disease (sensitivity 97%) and in 5/22 sera from patients with inactive disease (specificity 77%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Forearm blood flow was measured in order to calculate the flux of various substrates. At the same time, whole-body oxidation of fat, carbohydrate and protein was calculated using indirect calorimetry and urinary nitrogen excretion. 2. After an overnight fast (12-14 h), whole-body resting energy expenditure was accounted for by the oxidation of protein (15%), carbohydrate (17%) and fat (68%). At 30-36 h and 60-66 h of starvation, essentially all the non-protein energy was derived from the oxidation of fat (directly plus indirectly via ketone bodies). 3. After an overnight fast, acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutyrate were taken up by forearm muscle at a rate which could account for 5% of the resting O2 consumption of this tissue. As starvation progressed, forearm muscle took up more acetoacetate and released 3-hydroxybutyrate so that the net uptake of ketone bodies was sufficient to account for about 10% of the resting O2 consumption at 30-36 h of starvation and about 20% at 60-66 h of starvation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After an oral protein load, an average increase of 20% in glomerular filtration rate (from 91 +/- 19 to 110 +/- 27 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 was found in the hypertensive patients.

The glomerular response in hypertensive patients was independent of age, duration of hypertension, blood pressure, plasma renin activity, urinary albumin excretion and retinal vascular alterations. 4. All patients were re-evaluated after 6 weeks treatment with a new orally active angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, benazepril. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures were lowered in all the patients, but the drug did not affect the glomerular response to acute protein ingestion or the magnitude of urinary albumin excretion. 5. The findings of a normal 'renal functional reserve' and a lack of change in both urinary albumin excretion and the glomerular response after angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition cast doubt on the existence of increased intraglomerular pressure in hypertensive patients.\r"

To define more clearly the impact of encephalopathy on the course of sepsis, the various clinical signs of sepsis, blood culture results, and mortality rates were examined in relation to mental status in septic patients. Patients were classified as having an acutely altered mental status due to sepsis (AAMS), preexisting altered mental status (PAMS), or normal mental status (NMS). Twenty-three (307/1333) percent of the study patients had an acutely altered sensorium secondary to sepsis. Patients with AAMS had a higher mortality (49%) than patients with PAMS (41%) or patients with NMS (26%) (p less than .000001). Multivariate analysis disclosed that altered mental status, hypothermia, hypotension, thrombocytopenia, and the absence of shaking chills were independent predictors of increased mortality in the sepsis syndrome. Patients with Gram-negative bacteremia (28%) were as likely to have AAMS as patients with Gram-positive bacteremia (25%) or patients with negative blood cultures (23%). In summary, alterations in mental status are common in septic patients, and are associated with significantly higher mortality.\r"

The magnitude of HR decrease was pronounced in low cardiac index (CI), low mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP), and high systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI). Although there was some decrease in MAP associated with cold injectate, neither changes in SVRI nor those in the other hemodynamic variables correlated with the decreases in MAP. These results suggest that decreased CI and MPAP associated with elevated SVRI may be more susceptible to slowing of HR during cardiac output determination by TD in anesthetized patients.\r"

Platelet aggregation induced by ADP and arachidonic acid was inhibited when platelets harvested before trauma were incubated with granulocytes obtained 5 min after trauma. The granulocytes were separated from the platelets during the incubation by enclosure in dialysis tubes. Platelet inhibition was evident when the cell cohorts were suspended in cell-free medium as well as in autologous plasma extracted before trauma. In addition, incubation of platelets harvested before trauma with plasma obtained after trauma decreased platelet aggregation. In conclusion, granulocytes stimulated in vivo inhibited platelet function in vitro. Platelet inhibitory activity was shown to be related with the granulocytes per se, but also with factors present in plasma after trauma.\r"

Sepsis affects the CVS by several mechanisms and is associated with decreased serum Ca2+. The pharmacodynamic response of the CVS to serum Ca2+ alteration was compared in acutely septic and nonseptic dogs at serum Ca2+ levels of 50%, 100%, 150% and 200% of normal baseline values. Serum Ca2+ alterations caused similar changes in both groups, although finite differences existed between septic and nonseptic subjects. Ca manipulation produced limited differences in the response of mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, left ventricular dP/dtmax, systemic (SVR) and pulmonary (PVR) vascular resistance between septic and nonseptic subjects. PVR and SVR demonstrated opposite responses during hypocalcemia; PVR was lower than baseline in both groups, whereas SVR was higher at the 50% level. No difference was evident for total oxygen consumption (VO2) or heart rate. In view of the limited differences in response and the failure to improve systemic VO2, serum Ca2+ supplementation does not afford any additional benefit in this experimental model of acute sepsis.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of ACTH-(1-24) to prolong survival and to extend the deadline for effective blood reinfusion has been studied in a model of lethal hypovolemic shock in the rat. Anesthetized rats were bled to a mean arterial pressure of 18 to 25 mm Hg and then subjected to one of the following iv treatments: a) saline; b) ACTH-(1-24), 160 micrograms/kg; c) blood reinfusion; d) ACTH-(1-24), 160 micrograms/kg; c) blood reinfusion; d) ACTH-(1-24), with saline 5 min after bleeding died within 0.05 h. On the other hand, the treatment with ACTH-(1-24) induced an almost complete and sustained recovery of cardiovascular and respiratory functions associated with a survival time of 44 +/- 18 h, while four of six rats reinfused with the withdrawn blood were still alive 15 days later. The time-lapse between bleeding and treatment was of crucial importance, and neither ACTH-(1-24) injection nor blood reinfusion had any effect if performed 25 min after bleeding. However, treatment with ACTH-(1-24) shortly after bleeding (5 min) greatly improved the effect of a later blood reinfusion. These data indicate that ACTH-(1-24) can prolong survival and permit the time-lapse between blood loss and blood reinfusion to be extended.\r"

  ".W": "The use of nebulizers in neonatal ventilator circuits offers a new and relatively uncharted route of therapy for infants in respiratory failure. We used a model lung to investigate and compare different nebulizer types and therapeutic agents and to make practical observations. Five different nebulizers (Ultravent, Acorn, MAD2, Small Particle Aerosol Generator, and Pulmosonic) were compared for efficiency of delivery of an amino-phylline aerosol to the model lung, and the particle size of aerosol produced by them was measured. A Nebulizer Efficiency Index (NEI) was created, representing the deposition rate of the original solution as aerosol upon the model lung filter. The Acorn (2.8.10(3) ml/min) and MAD2 (2.4.10(-3) scored highest NEI. When a suspension of budesonide was nebulized, minimal amounts of drug were recovered from the filter when the nebulizer producing the smallest particle size (Ultravent) was studied, suggesting that suspensions of drugs behave differently from solutions. Significant changes need to be made to a conventional circuit when jet nebulizers are used; most of these are obviated by the use of an ultrasonic nebulizer, which also avoids the potential problem of marked cooling of the gas flow produced by jet nebulizers.\r"

During the menstrual cycle before treatment and also during a treatment cycle (100 mg of CC, on days 5 to 9), we obtained an endometrial biopsy 9 to 12 days after ovulation. All biopsies were read in a blinded fashion by the same gynecological pathologist. During the treatment cycle, 10 women had more than one preovulatory follicle (greater than 15 mm, mean of three dimensions), while 8 had one preovulatory follicle. Luteal phase defect was corrected according to biopsy in 8 of the 10 women with more than one preovulatory follicle, but in only 2 of the 8 women with a single preovulatory follicle.\r"

Serum E2 levels were stable throughout the first 48 hours of patch application but declined by a mean of 54% between 48 and 72 hours. Pituitary LH surges were induced with all three serum concentrations of E2 but were present more often with the higher serum values.

The availability of both sensitive and specific immunofluorimetric assay and algorithm for pulse detection enabled us to reanalyze the question of whether or not patients with hypothalamic amenorrhea secrete LH in a pulsatile fashion. Seven women with secondary amenorrhea associated with weight loss and four normally cycling women were studied, sampling every 5 minutes for 8 hours. Control subjects were studied during four different phases of the menstrual cycle. In all amenorrheic patients, a frequent LH pulsatile secretion, with pulses of low amplitude, was found (10.7 +/- 1.4 peaks/8 h; mean +/- SEM). The pulse frequency was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than any phases of the control group (early follicular: 7 +/- 0.4 peaks/8 h; late follicular: 6.8 +/- 0.6 peaks/8 h; early luteal: 4.3 +/- 0.4 peaks/8 h; late luteal: 7 +/- 0.3 peaks/8 h). The LH pulsatile release in amenorrheic patients showed a mean pulse duration and amplitude shorter than in any phase of the menstrual cycle of the controls. In conclusion, in weight-loss-related-amenorrhea, the major change was not the absence of the LH pulsatile release but its increased frequency with reduced pulse amplitude.\r"

Midluteal P and E2 were measured and expressed in ng/mL. There were no differences in P:E2 ratios (mean +/- SE) for ongoing pregnancies after hMG and hCG (n = 20, 112.6 +/- 14.9), CC and hCG (n = 6, 97.0 +/- 15.9), or CC alone (n = 5, 96.2 +/- 25.5), and the data were pooled.

Nine of the 18 hirsute women exhibited increased DEX sensitivity. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) responses after ovine CRF were significantly lower in the DEX-sensitive subgroup, but serum androstenedione was higher. Baseline serum androgen levels could not predict DEX responses. A significant negative correlation existed between the suppression of androgens after DEX and the increase in ACTH after ovine CRF. The suppression of androgen correlated with the ratio of the increase in androgen to the increase in ACTH after ovine CRF. We conclude that DEX sensitivity occurs frequently and cannot be predicted by levels of serum androgens. Blunted ACTH responses to ovine CRF may reflect enhanced adrenal sensitivity and altered feedback control.\r"

The skin samples were minced and incubated with 3H-DHEA or 3H-dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (3H-DHEAS) in medium for 1 hour at 37 degrees C. The following metabolites of DHEA were isolated after extraction and chromatography: 5-androstene-3 beta,17 beta-diol (delta 5-diol), 5 alpha-androstane-3,17-dione (5 alpha-delta 4A), testosterone, DHT, androsterone (A), and 5 alpha-androstane-3 alpha,17 beta-diol. Although the conversion of DHEA to all the metabolites was low, the conversions were higher in men than in women. In women, conversions of DHEA to delta 5-diol and androstenedione (delta 4A) were highest, followed by conversions of DHEA to DHT and 5 alpha-delta 4A, whereas in men the formation of delta 4A and 5 alpha-delta 4A was highest, followed by delta 5-diol and A. There was a significant conversion of DHEAS to DHEA in both women and men, although the sulfatase activity was approximately six times higher in men. We conclude that despite the low conversion of DHEA to DHT, significant androgenecity may result from pathological levels of DHEAS.\r"

Hirsutism was found more commonly in those women with confirmed coronary artery disease (chi 2 = 10.11). Waist:hip ratio (an index of android fat distribution) was associated with hirsutism (by ANOVA, F-test) and with coronary artery disease (t-test).

This particular probe is thought to constitute part of the putative testicular-determining factor gene. All the study subjects demonstrated the presence of zinc finger Y. Laser densitometry studies confirmed a correlation between the intensity of the zinc finger Y band and the percentage of Y cell lines. This study supports the fact that individuals with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and cytogenetically intact Y chromosomes will tend to have intact zinc finger Y sequences.\r"

All patients had a follow-up of at least 1 year. Prognostic variables were derived from the previous history, the preoperative fertility assessment, and the actual operation. Some variables were combined into a fertility reducing factor. A first selection was performed by comparing the preoperative and perioperative variable scores of the successes (defined as all intrauterine pregnancies within 1 year after surgery) with those of the failures (no intrauterine pregnancy within 1 year). Eight variables appeared to have prognostic potential. Taking account of the inter-relations of those variables by using logistic regression analysis, the localization of the anastomosis, the number of anastomosed tubes, and the presence of a fertility reducing factor were selected as the most predictive ones. Using this logistic model, an estimate of the pregnancy outcome could be calculated for each individual patient.\r"

A new method using novel ova surrogates, microspheres transport test, is designed to diagnose dysfunctional tubal sterility. Biodegradable test microspheres with diameters matching that of the native ovum were used. According to the optimum procedure, the suspension of test microspheres was applied through the vaginal wall into the Douglas' space under local anesthesia, and the transported microspheres were collected in a modified cervical cap. The microspheres were readily identified in the sediment of cervical secretion by their fluorescence. The method was tested in 139 long-term infertility patients. Transport was observed in 100% of the control group, and positive correlation between the transport findings and the anticipated frequencies of dysfunctional tubal sterility cases in other groups was found. Optimum diameter of test microspheres was estimated at about 175 microns. The test appears to be useful for examination of functional disorders of the ovum transport in human practice.\r"

When compared with patients with tubal factor infertility and less than or equal to 4 pre-embryos transferred, the clinical pregnancy rate (15.3% versus 22%) was not statistically different. However, the term/ongoing pregnancy rate was significantly lower in the study group (8% versus 16%). Comparison of the IVF outcome with different uterine anomalies as detected by hysterosalpingogram (n = 29) showed a trend for a worse prognosis in women with constrictions and a combination of T-shape and constrictions. It is concluded that implantation and pregnancy outcome are impaired in DES-exposed women after IVF.\r"

Comparisons of the percent change in post-thaw motility and sperm motion kinetics between four discrete ranges of prefreeze motility (32% to 66%, 67% to 76%, 77% to 84%, 85% to 94%) revealed that the effect of freezing on sperm cell survival was equivalent between all ranges. However, significant differences occurred between these ranges for curvilinear velocity, straight line velocity, and mean amplitude of lateral head displacement but not for linearity nor beat cross frequency. All correlations between prefreeze and post-thaw motion variables were significant but closest for curvilinear velocity and straight line velocity. Furthermore, correlations of prefreeze versus post-thaw velocity measurements were strongest for those cells within the 65% to 85% range of prefreeze motility. We suggest that sperm survival is independent of prefreeze motility. However, velocity kinetics appear stable after freezing for those specimens that had an initial motility of 65% to 85%.\r"

A small study in humans found no effect on menstrual cycle length, but an increase in luteal ovarian steroid levels. In view of these conflicting results, we studied the effect of tamoxifen on corpus luteum (CL) function in monkeys (n = 20). Blood was obtained daily beginning cycle day 8, and sera assayed for estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone. Four days after the midcycle E2 peak, laparoscopy confirmed CL formation, and the animals were administered (1) lactose (n = 7), (2) tamoxifen, 0.5 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 6), or (3) tamoxifen, 3.0 mg.kg-1.d-1 (n = 7) for 12 consecutive days. Serum collection continued until cycle day 50 or menses, whichever came first. Results indicate a biphasic response among tamoxifen-treated animals, with 7 of 13 developing prolonged luteal phases. There was, however, no significant difference in luteal phase length among the three groups, although when the two groups given tamoxifen were combined, the difference in luteal phase length versus controls approached significance. No differences were found among peak P levels, mean luteal phase P levels, or mean luteal phase gonadotropin levels. No variables were found to correlate significantly with luteal phase length. These results suggest that luteal phase administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen does not alter pituitary gonadotropin secretion or CL function. However, tamoxifen does prolong luteal phase length in a subset of monkeys, perhaps via a direct effect on the endometrium.\r"

Manipulated eggs were allowed to interact with 1 X 10(6) sperm/mL for 3 hours. A single large or medium slit was equally effective in permitting sperm entry into 46% and 47% of the manipulated eggs, respectively. However, the longer slit doubled the average number of sperm detected in the perivitelline space. A second medium-sized slit increased the rate of sperm entry into the perivitelline space to 76%, but the incidence of damaged oocytes also increased. A small slit did not permit sperm entry into any of the manipulated oocytes. This heterologous system of gamete interaction provides a model to evaluate requirements for successful partial zona dissection or other related procedures for assisted fertilization in the human.\r"

Zonae pellucidae of metaphase I and metaphase II oocytes were equally penetrable after the salt treatment, whereas penetration occurred only exceptionally when the oocytes were living. These results show that, after in vitro aging and subsequent salt treatment, eventual differences in oocyte maturity status will not influence results of zona pellucida penetration tests. On the other hand, successful penetration of salt-stored zonae pellucidae by spermatozoa does not necessarily imply that these spermatozoa are able to penetrate the zona pellucida of a fresh living oocyte.\r"

We measured the lower esophageal sphincter pressures and studied gastroesophageal reflux patterns over 24 hours using an ambulatory Gastroreflux Recorder (Del Mar Avionics, Irvine, CA) in 44 controls and 104 consecutive adult asthmatics. The presence or absence of reflux symptoms was not used as a selection criterion for asthmatics. All asthmatics had discrete episodes of diffuse wheezing and documented reversible airway obstruction of at least 20%. Patients underwent reflux testing while receiving, if any, their usual asthmatic medications: 71.2% required chronic bronchodilators and 28.8% required no bronchodilators. Compared with controls, asthmatics had significantly decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressures, greater esophageal acid exposure times, more frequent reflux episodes, and longer clearance times in both the upright and supine positions (P less than 0.0001 for all parameters tested). There were no differences in any of the measured reflux parameters between asthmatics who required bronchodilators and those who did not. Thus, the decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressures and increased levels of acid reflux in asthmatics were not entirely caused by the effects of bronchodilator therapy. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis generated reflux values that discriminated asthmatics from controls. More than 80% of adult asthmatics have abnormal gastroesophageal reflux. We conclude that most adult asthmatics, regardless of the use of bronchodilator therapy, have abnormal gastroesophageal reflux manifested by increased reflux frequency, delayed acid clearance during the day and night, and diminished lower esophageal sphincter pressures.\r"

In addition, portacaval shunting, which is not associated with elevated serum gastrin, causes an increase in enterochromaffinlike cell density. The present study shows that the combination of portacaval shunting and omeprazole-evoked, long-lasting hypergastrinemia results in enhanced enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia despite the fact that the hypergastrinemia was not significantly greater than in intact omeprazole-treated rats. The mechanism behind the enhanced response to gastrin of the enterochromaffinlike cells in rats with portacaval shunts is unknown. When results from untreated and omeprazole-treated rats were plotted, there was a linear correlation between the serum gastrin concentration and the enterochromaffinlike cell density in both sham-operated rats and rats with portacaval shunts. We conclude that gastrin plays a role in the development of enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia following omeprazole treatment in rats with portacaval shunts but that other as yet unidentified agents may also promote the response.\r"

Eighteen normal male volunteers were studied on two separate days. Following a 20-minute baseline period, subjects received infusions of saline or synthetic cholecystokinin-8 at increasing rates. Basal plasma cholecystokinin levels averaged 1.3 +/- 0.2 pmol/L (mean +/- SE) and increased to levels of 7.4 +/- 0.9 pmol/L, 12.1 +/- 2.4 pmol/L, and 23.1 +/- 3.8 pmol/L during cholecystokinin infusion rates of 21, 42, and 84 pmol/min, respectively. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure was recorded continuously with a sleeved catheter. Basal lower esophageal sphincter pressure averaged 19.9 mm Hg and did not change with the first infusion, which produced physiological peak postprandial plasma levels of cholecystokinin. Lower esophageal sphincter pressure declined only during the infusions that produced plasma cholecystokinin levels two to four times greater than normal peak postprandial levels. Since infusion of cholecystokinin to levels that reproduce physiological blood levels does not significantly decrease lower esophageal sphincter pressure, it was concluded that cholecystokinin is not a major hormonal regulator of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation.\r"

Cholecystokinin-58 was nearly as immunoreactive as sulfated, amidated cholecystokinin-8 with one cholecystokinin-specific antiserum and an antiserum with moderate (18%) gastrin cross-reactivity, but two to four times less immunoreactive than the octapeptide with two other cholecystokinin-specific antisera and an antiserum with full cross-reactivity with cholecystokinin and gastrin. The cross-reactivity of cholecystokinin-58 with all antisera was increased by trypsinization, and the magnitude of the increase was related to the degree of trypsinization. These results suggest that it is not possible to measure absolute cholecystokinin levels in tissue and blood with antisera reported to date and that cholecystokinin-58 has a tertiary structure that influences its binding to cholecystokinin antibodies.\r"

  ".W": "The development of the motilin receptor was studied through contraction and binding studies of groups of three rabbits aged between 2 and 289 days. The contractility of small intestinal smooth muscle strips was measured isotonically. The aborally decreasing gradient in response to motilin, known to exist in adult rabbits, was already present at day 8 (maximum contractile responses expressed as a percent of the maximal response to acetylcholine were 77% +/- 9%, 34% +/- 10%, and 25% +/- 8% for duodenal, jejunal, and ileal strips, respectively). Throughout the observation period, the doses of motilin and its agonist erythromycin that were required to induce 50% of the response remained constant and were not significantly different from doses required for adults (their negative logarithms were 8.55 +/- 0.35 and 5.70 +/- 0.25, respectively). The correlation between the maximum contractile response toward motilin and erythromycin was almost perfect (r2 = 0.82). Binding studies with iodinated norleucine13-porcine motilin were performed using antral smooth muscle tissue homogenates. The maximum number of binding sites increased rapidly after 8 days (3.3 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein) and reached a peak at 21 days (20.7 +/- 1.4 fmol/mg protein), but decreased at that point toward the adult value (40 days, 10.6 +/- 1.3; 289 days, 9.8 +/- 1.1 fmol/mg protein). The dissociation constant, however, remained unchanged. The peak value of receptor density occurred at about the time that the rate of increase of the length of the intestine and of the weight of the antrum were at maximum levels (at 18 and 27 days, respectively). Motilin receptors are expressed early postnatally, and the regional gradient in sensitivity towards motilin is also established soon after birth. If applicable to humans, an early response to erythromycin may have therapeutic value.\r"

Fifteen minutes after injection of urethane, somatostatin messenger RNA concentrations were increased by 128% compared with those in nontreated rats. The significant elevation of somatostatin messenger RNA was maintained for 2 hours after injection. Somatostatin monoclonal antibody injected intravenously (2 mg) completely reversed the inhibitory effect of somatostatin (20 micrograms/kg.h) on pentagastrin (24 micrograms/kg.h)-stimulated gastric acid secretion. The somatostatin monoclonal antibody dose dependently increased basal gastric acid secretion in urethane-anesthetized rats. Peak acid response to the somatostatin monoclonal antibody (2 mg) was observed 20 minutes after antibody injection (preinjection, 1.4 +/- 1.2 mumol/10 min; postinjection, 10.6 +/- 0.6 mumol/10 min); meanwhile, levels of plasma gastrin increased from 27 +/- 6 pg/mL to 75 +/- 8 pg/mL and were maintained elevated for the 2-hour experimental period. When gastrin monoclonal antibody 28.2 was injected together with somatostatin monoclonal antibody, the stimulatory effect of the somatostatin antibody was inhibited by 82%. A control monoclonal antibody 109-21 directed against the biologically inactive glycine-extended fragment 66-72 of progastrin did not alter basal gastric acid secretion or the inhibitory effect of somatostatin. These results indicate that one mechanism by which urethane induced low basal gastric acid secretion involved increased synthesis and release of endogenous somatostatin and associated inhibition of gastrin secretion.\r"

  ".U": "90337141\r", 
  ".W": "Short-chain fatty acids are the predominant luminal anion in the colon and are generally absorbed rapidly in vivo. However, the mechanisms of in vitro transport of short-chain fatty acids have not been fully delineated. Therefore, we examined [14C]propionate fluxes in rabbit proximal colon under short-circuit conditions. There was minimal metabolism of propionate (less than 10%), permitting accurate flux measurements using a radioisotopic tracer. In a 20 mmol/L propionate Ringer's solution at pH 7.4, there was a significant rate of propionate secretion (-0.58 +/- 0.08 microEq.cm-2.h-1). Decreasing pH to 6.8 by decreasing bicarbonate concentration in the bathing medium resulted in increases in unidirectional fluxes but no change in net transport. Reversal of propionate secretion to propionate absorption was elicited by HEPES substitution for bicarbonate at pH 6.8 or by serosal addition of epinephrine, which increases apical Na(+)-H+ exchange in this epithelium. Propionate absorption was blocked by both amiloride, an Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, and ouabain. Under basal conditions, there was a concentration-dependent increase in basal unidirectional propionate fluxes with no change in net transport as the concentration of propionate increased from 10 to 60 mmol/L. In contrast, a concentration-dependent saturation of epinephrine-stimulated propionate absorption was apparent. Transepithelial propionate gradients did not yield a significant diffusion potential. These results suggest that, in rabbit proximal colon, (a) there is bidirectional diffusion of propionate, most probably in the protonated rather than the ionized form; (b) a component of propionate transport is active and linked to electroneutral Na+ absorption through apical Na(+)-H+ exchange; and (c) changes in composition of the fluid bathing the proximal colon in vitro may significantly alter both rates and direction of short-chain fatty acid transport. Regulation of transcellular active transport may play an important role in colonic short-chain fatty acid conservation.\r"

When injected intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg just before feeding, dl- or d-N-allylnormetazocine, 1-3-di-o-tolylguanidine, and (+) cinnamyl-1-phenyl-1-N-methyl-N-cyclopropylene (but not phencyclidine) enhanced the colonic motor response to a meal by increasing the 0-4-hour motility indexes from 64.1%-159.3% in both the proximal and transverse colon but had no effect on colonic motility in fasted animals or animals injected intracerebroventricularly. The motor-stimulatory effects of d-N-allylnormetazocine (1 mg/kg), 1-3-di-o-tolylguanidine (0.25 mg/kg), and (+) cinnamyl-1-phenyl-1-N-methyl-N-cyclopropylene (1 mg/kg) were abolished after previous treatment with haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg, intravenous) but not after sulpiride (0.1 mg/kg) or (+) R-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-3- methyl-5-phenyl-1-H-3-benzozepine-OH. Prazosin (0.1 mg/kg, intravenous) and 1-methyl-3-(2-indolyl)amino-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (0.01 mg/kg) also suppressed the enhancement of the colonic motor response to eating induced by d-N-allylnormetazocine, 1-3-di-o-tolylguanidine, and (+)cinnamyl-1-phenyl-1-N-methyl-N-cyclopropylene whereas naltrexone did not affect their effects. It is concluded that d-N-allylnormetazocine, 1-3-di-o-tolylguanidine, and (+)cinnamyl-1-phenyl-1-N-methyl-N-cyclopropylene stimulate the postprandial colonic motility in dogs by acting selectively on sigma receptors located peripherally and probably by affecting the release of cholecystokinin octapeptide through a central adrenergic mechanism.\r"

Although the bacterium is usually isolated by culture of a gastric biopsy specimen, viable organisms may sometimes be found in the acidic gastric juice. It was postulated that urease, by generating ammonia, protected H. pylori from acid. To test this hypothesis, the pH susceptibility of H. pylori, Proteus mirabilis, and the urease-negative Campylobacter jejuni was examined in the presence and absence of urea. It was found that without urea the three bacteria were all highly susceptible to acid. In striking contrast, the addition of 5 mmol/L of urea completely protected H. pylori but not P. mirabilis or C. jejuni from pH values as low as 1.5. Furthermore, the protective effect of urea on H. pylori was found with urea concentrations as low as 0.05 mmol/L. It is concluded that the high urease activity of H. pylori enables it to survive in gastric acid.\r"

Perfusion continued for an additional 100 minutes and prostaglandin E2 was determined in the effluent with a radiometric method. Patients with histologically active celiac disease (n = 7) had higher basal jejunal secretion of prostaglandin E2, 523 +/- 229 pg.cm-1.h-1 (mean +/- SEM), than both celiac patients with normalized small bowel mucosa (n = 6), 160 +/- 44 pg.cm-1.h-1, and healthy controls (n = 18), 184 +/- 38 pg.cm-1.h-1, (P less than 0.05). After gliadin challenge of the jejunal segment, a significant increase (P less than 0.05) in prostaglandin E2 secretion was noted in patients with celiac disease (n = 10). The individual maximum increase was on average fivefold and occurred 60-100 minutes after gliadin administration. In healthy controls (n = 5), no alteration in prostaglandin E2 secretion was detected after gliadin challenge. Enhanced jejunal prostaglandin 2 synthesis may be involved in the pathophysiological processes initiated by gliadin in patients with celiac disease.\r"

Each period included a 3-day adaptation period during which sugar alcohol doses were increased, a 4-day equilibration period, a 2-day stool collection period, and a 2-day intubation period. From day 4, the daily administered amounts were either 30 g pure sorbitol, 57 g maltitol containing 30 g sorbitol, or 69 g Lycasin 80/55 (Roquette, Lestrem, France), which is a hydrogenated glucose syrup also containing 30 g sorbitol. The distal ileal output of sugar alcohols and their components was determined by aspiration after a single meal. The mean percentage of sorbitol absorbed in the small intestine was significantly higher in pure sorbitol doses than in those containing maltitol and Lycasin 80/55 (79% +/- 4% vs. 64% +/- 4% and 64% +/- 5%, mean +/- SEM). The mean percentage of total maltitol digested was not different for pure maltitol and maltitol contained in Lycasin 80/55 (90% +/- 2% vs. 86% +/- 2%). Stool excretion of sugar alcohols was negligible, indicating that the sugar alcohols reaching the colon were almost completely digested by the colonic flora. The mean estimated energy values of the sugar alcohols ingested in kcal/g were 3.58 +/- 0.08 for sorbitol, about 3.50 +/- 0.07 for maltitol, and between 3.11 +/- 0.08 and 3.54 +/- 0.08 for Lycasin 80/55. Because the experimental conditions of this study mimicked the usual way of consumption of the three sugar alcohols, little calorie saving can be expected from the chronic consumption of these sugar alcohols in so-called sugar-free products.\r"

Enteroglucagon, which is synthesized in the L cells of the intestinal mucosa, is thought to be an important humoral factor in this response. In this study, the levels of glucagon gene expression in the rat ileum both after massive small bowel resection and during development are examined. Glucagon messenger RNA levels are increased threefold as part of the adaptive response; the increase is maximal at 2 days and is at least partly dependent on luminal nutrition. Levels of glucagon messenger RNA in the developing ileum increase in the postnatal period until weaning when they decrease somewhat before gradually reaching adult levels.\r"

This substituted benzimidazole molecule had been shown to decrease several liver cytochrome P450-mediated monooxygenase activities both in vitro and in vivo. The present work was undertaken to determine whether this drug was an inducer of cytochrome P450 in humans. Primary cultures of human hepatocytes were maintained in a serum-free, chemically defined medium for 0-96 hours in the absence or in the presence of omeprazole (1-100 mumol/L) or of other cytochrome P450 inducers such as 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone, or rifampicin for comparison. Omeprazole produced a time- and concentration-dependent increase in (a) cytochrome P450IA2 accumulation determined by western blot in microsomes from omeprazole-treated cells, while the level of other cytochrome P450 forms including P450IID6, IIE1, and IIIA was not increased in the same culture; (b) several monoxygenase activities, including phenacetin deethylase and acetanilide hydroxylase (cytochrome P450IA2) and ethoxyresorufin deethylase and benzpyrene hydroxylase (cytochrome P450IA1); (c) cytochrome P450IA2 de novo synthesis, determined by immunoprecipitation of cell lysate from [3H]Leu-labeled cells; (d) cytochromes P450IA1 and IA2 mRNAs, determined by northern blot analysis. An in vivo study was carried out on liver microsomes from five patients for whom hepatic biopsy specimens were available before and after repeated administration of omeprazole (20 mg/day for 4 days). In all cases, several-fold increases in cytochrome P450IA2 and specific cytochrome P450IA subfamily-dependent monooxygenase activities were observed in agreement with the results from cell culture. It was concluded that omeprazole is an aryl hydrocarbon-like inducer of cytochrome P450 secretion in human liver both in vitro and in vivo. This drug is therefore likely to increase the metabolism of any xenobiotic specifically oxidized by a cytochrome P450IA subfamily. This could potentiate the hepatotoxicity of phenacetin or paracetamol and activation of procarcinogens.\r"

Three patients had short exposure (less than 3 months), four long exposure (greater than 1 year). Among those with brief exposure, symptoms included anorexia, abdominal pain, and disulfiram-type reaction. Aminotransferases were markedly elevated with the ratio of alanine aminotransferase to aspartate aminotransferase always greater than 1. Liver biopsy showed focal hepatocellular necrosis and microvesicular steatosis with prominence of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, complex lysosomes, and pleomorphic mitochondria with crystalline inclusions. Among workers with long exposure, symptoms were minimal and enzyme elevations modest. Biopsies showed macrovesicular steatosis, pleomorphic mitochondria without crystalloids, and prominent smooth endoplasmic reticulum, but no evidence of persisting acute injury or fibrosis. Abnormal aminotransferases in both groups may persist for months after removal from exposure, but progression to cirrhosis in continually exposed workers was not observed. We conclude that exposure of these workers to solvents, chiefly dimethylformamide, may result in two variants of toxic liver injury with subtle clinical, laboratory, and morphological features. This may be readily overlooked if occupational history and biopsy histology are not carefully evaluated.\r"

Balb/c mice were primed with Propionibacterium acnes to induce the infiltration of mononuclear cells into the liver. Immunohistochemical study showed that most of the accumulated mononuclear cells at 7 days were Mac-2 positive, suggesting that they were activated macrophages. An injection of lipopolysaccharide resulted in massive hepatic necrosis and high mortality in the mice within 24 hours. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity initially rose sharply and then declined over 3 hours. The increase in plasma aminotransferase activity correlated well with the elevation of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity. Pretreatment with dexamethasone or 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E2 attenuated not only the elevation of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha activity but also the increase in plasma aminotransferase activity and improved the survival rate. Passive immunization against tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed protective effects. These findings suggest that tumor necrosis factor-alpha released from activated macrophages may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this murine hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "When rats received endotoxin 48 hours after two-thirds liver resection, 50% of them died within 12 hours with massive hepatic necrosis at a dose that did not affect sham-operated rats. In the hepatic sinusoids, fibrin deposition and endothelial cell destruction occurred 5 hours after endotoxin administration. When antithrombin III concentrate was infused concomitantly with endotoxin administration, all rats survived 12 hours, and the extent of hepatic necrosis and the deranged serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase values were significantly attenuated at 5 hours compared with those in the control rats. Similar improvements in the incidence of mortality and liver injury were observed after treatment with gum arabic before hepatectomy. The stimulatory state of Kupffer cells based on the ability to produce superoxide anions estimated by formazan deposition after liver perfusion with nitro blue tetrazolium and phorbol myristate acetate was increased between 24 and 72 hours after operation. This increase disappeared after gum arabic treatment. It is concluded that massive hepatic necrosis can occur as a result of sinusoidal fibrin deposition provoked by endotoxin in partially hepatectomized rats. Activated Kupffer cells may contribute to this provocation.\r"

Cases of primary biliary cirrhosis in 95 patients from two centers are presented: 70 patients from a regional referral center (Freeman Hospital, FH) and 25 from an international tertiary referral center (King's College Hospital, KCH) with similar mean age at diagnosis and duration of follow-up (median, 12 months). During follow-up, 19 of 70 FH patients and 15 of 25 KCH patients developed symptoms (P less than 0.001); the mean time to symptom appearance was 43 months at FH and 35 months at KCH (P = 0.0012). Twenty-five of 95 patients died, 15 of 34 subjects who had developed symptoms (all liver-related deaths) and 10 of 61 who remained asymptomatic (all non-liver-related deaths) (P less than 0.001). Hepatic mortality was worse than among the normal population (P less than 0.05). A comparison of those patients developing symptoms with 111 at FH and 165 at KCH who presented with symptoms suggests no difference in survival once hepatic symptoms appear. In both centers, hepatic mortality was strongly related to symptom appearance in asymptomatic primary biliary cirrhosis: patients developing symptoms resemble those with symptoms at presentation. Other differences between the centers may reflect different referral patterns.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate changes in liver metabolic zonation during development of juvenile cirrhosis, zonal activities of succinate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphatase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) dehydrogenase were measured by quantitative cytochemistry in the liver of developing rats intoxicated with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbitone. During treatment, activities were most decreased in perivenular zones and subsequently at the periphery of the cirrhotic nodules for succinate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphatase, whereas glutamate dehydrogenase and NADPH dehydrogenase were less affected. In the periportal zones, enzyme activities decreased less. After stopping intoxication, the rats remained cirrhotic, but enzyme activities returned to control perivenular levels at the periphery of the cirrhotic nodule and to control periportal levels at its center. It is concluded that a metabolic zonation persists in carbontetrachloride/phenobarbitone-induced juvenile cirrhosis and that enzyme activities can recover despite persisting cirrhosis. In this model, afferent vessels seem to be located at the center of the cirrhotic nodules, and efferent vessels, at their periphery. A different metabolic zonation may exist in other human and animal liver cirrhosis that could be related to the site of initial liver damage.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-six children aged 1-13 years who were known to be positive for hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e antigen in serum for at least 6 months and who had biopsy-proven chronic hepatitis have been followed longitudinally for 1-12 years (mean, 5 years). Twenty-three of them are now young adults. Eight patients had acute type B hepatitis 12-24 months before entering the study, while 68 patients came to observation during a chronic phase. At the beginning of follow-up, all 76 children were positive in serum for hepatitis B virus DNA, and 44 (58%) had chronic active hepatitis, associated with cirrhosis in two cases. During follow-up, 23 (30%) patients remained hepatitis B e antigen-positive, most with unchanged biochemical and histological features. The other 53 (70%) cases seroconverted to hepatitis B e antibody and cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum, including 7 of 8 (87%) patients with acute hepatitis at presentation. After seroconversion, alanine aminotransferase levels normalized in all patients and remained normal in 49 patients (92.5%) throughout a mean observation period of 3 years. Five of these children, including 2 of 7 (29%) with previous acute hepatitis, eventually cleared hepatitis B surface antigen from their sera. Finally, 4 (7.5%) patients experienced a mild increase of alanine aminotransferase levels several months after seroconversion in the absence of hepatitis B virus replication or of delta virus superinfection. Clinical and virological parameters did not significantly differ between patients with or without acute onset; however, seroconversion occurred earlier, and the rate of hepatitis B surface antigen clearance was greater in the former than in the latter group. The present data indicate that approximately two thirds of children with hepatitis B e antigen- and hepatitis B virus DNA-positive chronic hepatitis clear hepatitis B virus DNA from their sera before reaching adulthood. After termination of viral replication, most patients achieve a sustained biochemical remission, suggesting the disappearance of disease activity. Reactivation of virus replication after hepatitis B e antibody seroconversion has never been observed in this series, although mild alanine aminotransferase level abnormalities could be detected in a minority of cases.\r"

Diversion of bile and pancreatic juice increased plasma CCK concentration to 19.1 +/- 4.0 pmol/L. Intraduodenal sodium taurocholate (78 mumol/h) reduced plasma CCK concentration to 6.6 +/- 1.5 pmol/L after 1 hour, but values increased to 17.3 +/- 2.3 pmol/L after 13.5 hours despite continued taurocholate infusion. Pancreatic protein secretion was also significantly but transiently inhibited by taurocholate. However, neither acute nor chronic intraduodenal bile infusion significantly reduced plasma CCK concentration compared with sodium bicarbonate infusion (13.4 +/- 1.9 pmol/L vs. 15.0 +/- 1.7 pmol/L, respectively). Chronic (13.5 hours) intraduodenal infusion of taurocholate plus pancreatic juice caused a sustained reduction of plasma CCK level to 3.1 +/- 0.5 pmol/L, which significantly increased to 9.4 +/- 1.1 pmol/L after cessation of taurocholate but with continued infusion of pancreatic juice. The results indicate that bile does not inhibit CCK release and that bile acids do not physiologically inhibit pancreatic secretion or CCK release independent of the presence of pancreatic proteases.\r"

This study examined the effect of neural blockade on cholecystokinin-octapeptide-induced contraction of the intact guinea pig gallbladder in vitro using cholecystokinin-octapeptide applied to the gallbladder serosa, the lumen, or both compartments simultaneously. Simultaneous cholecystokinin stimulation of both the lumen and serosa was the most potent stimulus to contraction, and the responses were significantly inhibited by atropine and tetrodotoxin. Cholecystokinin in the gallbladder lumen alone evoked contraction by a dose-dependent mechanism that was entirely blocked by atropine or tetrodotoxin. Serosal application of cholecystokinin was the least potent, resulting in contractile responses and low sensitivity to neural blockers comparable to effects reported in muscle strips. The results suggest that cholecystokinin can cause gallbladder contraction by stimulating muscle receptors, neural receptors, or both, and combined neural and muscular stimulation is the most potent contractile stimulus.\r"

The ratio for isomer I to III for total serum coproporphyrin concentration was determined in six cases; the concentration of isomer I was greater than or equal to that of isomer III in each case. Urinary total porphyrin excretion was found to be elevated in six of the seven cases, with 72% +/- 8% occurring as coproporphyrins I and III. The ratio for urinary coproporphyrin I to III was greater than or equal to 1 in six of these patients, the reverse of the typical normal isomer distribution. Inasmuch as the presence or absence of photocutaneous lesions did not correlate with levels of porphyrins in serum or urine, other factors may be involved in the pathogenesis of the skin lesions.\r"

The study included 250 cases with surgically or ultrasonographically confirmed cholecystolithiasis and 526 hospital control patients. The highest gallstone risk was found at low high-density cholesterol levels and high triglyceride levels. An additional weakly negative association was found between total cholesterol level and gallstone risk. These findings were similar for cholesterol gallstones and pigment gallstones. The association between body mass index and gallstone risk disappeared after adjustment for serum lipids in a multivariate analysis. This study confirms previous reports on the association between gallstone risk and serum lipids. The similarity between cholesterol and pigment gallstones with regard to their association with serum lipids indicates that these types of gallstones share more causal factors than previously suggested. The absence of an effect of body mass index independent from serum lipids (as shown by the multivariate analysis) suggests that serum lipids are more closely linked to the pathogenesis of gallstones than obesity.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of two antisecretory drugs, omeprazole and cimetidine, on the hepatic extraction of indocyanine green and lidocaine was studied in the isolated perfused rat liver. Both indocyanine green and lidocaine are removed by the liver with high extraction efficiency in a flow-dependent manner. The elimination of lidocaine, but not indocyanine green, involves metabolism by the mixed-function oxidase in the liver. A selective effect on the hepatic extraction of lidocaine, but not indocyanine green, may therefore indicate an inhibition of hepatic mixed-function oxidase. To test this hypothesis, a nonrecycling system at a fixed perfusion flow rate was used to measure the extraction of lidocaine. Under control conditions, the extraction rate of lidocaine was 83% +/- 8%. In the presence of omeprazole at concentrations of 0.9, 2.0, and 4.5 micrograms/mL, the extraction rates were 81% +/- 9%, 82% +/- 7%, and 75% +/- 7%, respectively. These changes were not significantly different than control rates. In contrast, the increasing concentrations of cimetidine caused significant decreases in the hepatic extraction of lidocaine to values of 78% +/- 8%, 63% +/- 14%, and 48% +/- 14% at concentrations of 0.25, 0.50 and 1.25 micrograms/mL, respectively. The hepatic extraction of indocyanine green, 39% +/- 6%, was not affected by the administration of either omeprazole or cimetidine. Thus, in the rat, omeprazole seems to be a less potent inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 than cimetidine.\r"

Thirty minutes of total regional ischemia, followed by 3 hours of reperfusion, produced intestinal damage that was completely prevented by gamma-hydroxybutyrate pretreatment. Naloxone partially blocked this protective effect. Allopurinol provided only partial protection against this injury, whereas vitamin E provided none. Treatment with gamma-hydroxybutyrate after ischemia but before reperfusion also provided significant protection. This study clearly demonstrates that gamma-hydroxybutyrate provides significant protection against intestinal ischemic injury and that it may do so via an opiate receptor-mediated mechanism.\r"

They also had as much reflux as a result of small and slow changes in pH around the pH limit of 4 as they had due to proper reflux episodes. This did not change over time after the postprandial period. More 12 hour acid exposure was related to more frequent night time reflux. In normal subjects compared with patients reflux triggered increased contractile activity, and contractile activity at a normal pH was greater in patients than in normal subjects.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism that controls venting of gas from the stomach into the oesophagus was studied manometrically in 14 healthy subjects. The stomach was distended abruptly with one litre of carbon dioxide. Gas reflux was characterised by an abrupt increase in basal oesophageal body pressure to intragastric pressure. Reflux of gas from the stomach into the oesophagus occurred during transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations that generally had a pattern distinctly different from swallow-induced lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Thus, at the onset of an episode of gas reflux lower oesophageal sphincter pressure had relaxed to 3 mmHg, or less, in 96% of instances. After gas loading of the stomach the prevalence of gas reflux was significantly less when the subjects were supine (1.2/10 min) than when they were sitting (6.8/10 min) (p less than 0.001). The lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations associated with most episodes of gas reflux had a distinctive pattern that resembled those of the lower oesophageal sphincter relaxations associated with acid gastro-oesophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "Concern about contamination of fibreoptic endoscopes with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has generated a variety of disruptive and possibly unnecessary infection control practices in endoscopy units. Current recommendations on the cleaning and disinfection of endoscopes have been formulated without applied experimental evidence of the effective removal of HIV from endoscopes. To study the kinetics of elimination of HIV from endoscope surfaces, we artificially contaminated the suction-biopsy channels of five Olympus GIF XQ20 endoscopes with high titre HIV in serum. The air and water channels of two instruments were similarly contaminated. Contamination was measured by irrigating channels with viral culture medium and collecting 3 ml at the distal end for antigen immunoassay. Endoscopes were then cleaned manually in neutral detergent according to the manufacturer's recommendations and disinfected in 2% alkaline glutaraldehyde (Cidex, Surgikos) for two, four, and ten minutes. Contamination with HIV antigens was measured before and after cleaning and after each period of disinfection. Initial contamination comprised 4.8 x 10(4) to 3.5 x 10(6) pg HIV antigen/ml. Cleaning in detergent achieved a reduction to 165 pg/ml (99.93%) on one endoscope and to undetectable levels (100%) on four. After two minutes in alkaline glutaraldehyde all samples were negative and remained negative after the longer disinfection times. Air and water channels, where contaminated, were tested after 10 minutes' disinfection and were negative. These findings underline the importance of cleaning in removing HIV from endoscope and indicate that the use of dedicated equipment and long disinfection times are unnecessary.\r"

  ".W": "Disturbances of gastrointestinal motility are a common feature of diabetes mellitus and are usually ascribed to autonomic neuropathy. In order to assess the role of other factors on changes in motility in diabetes we have studied the stomach to caecum transit time (SCTT) during the progression of streptozotocin induced diabetes in the rat. Rats were used one, two, four, and eight weeks after a single injection of streptozotocin and age matched animals were used as controls. In further experiments non-diabetic rats received a bolus injection of pancreatic glucagon (50 or 75 micrograms intraperitoneally) or its diluent. SCTT was estimated using the non-invasive hydrogen excretion method. SCTT was unaffected by the age of the animal (mean (SEM) value: 101 (5) min), but was significantly delayed at one week (139 (11) min, p less than 0.01), two weeks (163 (16) min, p less than 0.01), four weeks (148 (9) min, p less than 0.01), and eight weeks (171 (13) min, p less than 0.01) after streptozotocin. SCTT was also slower during hyperglucagonaemia (control 96 (6) min; glucagon treated 50 micrograms: 120 (7) min, p less than 0.05 and 75 micrograms: 127 (8), p less than 0.05). Since autonomic neuropathy is not a recognised feature of the initial stages of diabetes hyperglucagonaemia may be responsible, at least in part, for diabetes induced changes in gastrointestinal motility.\r"

The association with coeliac disease was further investigated. Msp I DP beta polymorphism was studied in 52 healthy subjects and 59 patients: a 4.9 kb fragment was present in 51% of patients with coeliac disease compared to 11.5% of control subjects (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, nearly all subjects with the DP alpha 3.5 kb fragment also had the DP beta 4.9 kb fragment. However, disease frequency was still increased in the DP alpha 3.5 positive/DP beta 4.9 negative group. In seven families, each with at least two affected members, while the DP alpha 3.5 fragment was frequently present in patients it did not preferentially segregate with any particular HLA haplotype--for example, those associated with DR3 or DR7--and therefore is not part of an extended haplotype associated with coeliac disease. We therefore conclude that a gene(s) in the HLA-DP region predisposes to coeliac disease independently of the HLA-DR/DQ regions.\r"

In the present study a synthetic dodecapeptide from the corresponding viral epitope (Ad12E1b, residues 384-395) was tested for its effect on peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 22 treated and eight untreated patients with coeliac disease, 22 healthy subjects, 11 patients with ulcerative colitis, and 11 patients with Crohn's disease by an indirect leucocyte migration inhibition assay. In addition, the effect of both the viral and the gliadin synthetic peptides was studied by proliferation and migration assays simultaneously performed in an unselected subgroup of 12 treated coeliac patients and 12 healthy subjects of the study. Coeliac patients with untreated disease showed no response to the viral peptide compared with treated patients (p greater than 0.1). Treated coeliac patients showed a significantly different response from healthy control subjects and control patients with disease (p less than 0.001) which was dependent on the concentration of the viral peptide. In the subgroup of the treated coeliac patients (n = 12) there was a significant correlation between the responses in the migration and the proliferation assay using either the viral (p less than 0.02) or the gliadin (p less than 0.005) peptide at the highest concentration (33.3 micrograms/ml). Furthermore, the responses obtained using viral peptide correlated significantly with the responses obtained with gliadin peptide in both the migration (p less than 0.001) and the proliferation (p less than 0.001) assays. These results show that in coeliac patients there is pronounced cross reactivity at the level of T cell recognition between synthetic peptides derived from the Ad12 and A-gliadin. This antigenic cross reactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of coeliac disease.\r"

Treatment groups of six animals were used and compared to untreated groups of 12. Epithelioid cell granulomas and primary macrophage granulomas were induced by the inoculation of BCG (Pasteur) and irradiated Mycobacterium leprae respectively into the terminal ileum of the guinea pig. The response to purified protein derivative of tuberculin was reduced in both groups of animals receiving any of these agents. Cyclophosphamide and methotrexate treated animals inoculated with BCG or M leprae showed a significant reduction of granulomatous infiltration at the inoculation site (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001 respectively). BCG inoculated animals treated with either hydrocortisone or cyclosporin A showed no reduction in granulomatous infiltration at either the inoculation site or the draining lymph nodes. By contrast M leprae inoculated animals receiving either of these agents showed a significant reduction of granulomatous infiltration at both the inoculation site (p less than 0.001) and in the primary draining lymph node (p less than 0.001). Ziehl Neelsen staining showed an increased proportion of animals with detectable acid fast bacilli (AFB) at the inoculation site in the groups receiving hydrocortisone (50%) and methotrexate (67%) compared to untreated controls (8%). No AFB were observed in any of the animals inoculated with M leprae. In conclusion, this model may be helpful in elucidating the mechanism of T lymphocyte response in Crohn's disease and the variable clinical response seen with the use of immunosuppressive agents in this condition.\r"

  ".W": "Hydrogen gas, which is produced during fermentation in the human colon, is either excreted in breath or metabolised by gut bacteria through a variety of pathways. These may include methanogenesis, dissimilatory sulphate reduction, and acetogenesis. To determine which of these routes predominates in the large intestine, stools were taken from 30 healthy subjects and incubated as 5% (w/v) slurries with Lintner's starch. In 23 of 30 subjects, methane production was the main method of hydrogen disposal. In the remaining seven, high rates of sulphate reduction were recorded together with raised production of H2S. All samples showed relatively low rates of hydrogen evolution and of acetate formation from CO2 and H2. Sulphate reduction and methanogenesis seem to be mutually exclusive in the colon and this is probably linked to sulphate availability. Sulphate reduction, methanogenesis, and acetogenesis were strongly influenced by pH. Sulphate reduction was optimal at alkaline pH values whereas methane production was maximal at a neutral pH and acetogenesis favoured acidic conditions. Faecal H2S values were related to carriage of sulphate reducing bacteria. These data show that a number of competing pathways for hydrogen disposal are possible in the large gut and that a variety of factors such as colonic pH and sulphate availability can determine which of these mechanisms predominates.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin 1 is a polypeptide cytokine produced by various cell types and has been shown to have a major role in inflammatory and immunological responses. In experimental colitis it proved to be a dominant mediator and a reliable marker of inflammation. The aim of the present study was to determine in vitro the extent of production and release of interleukin 1 from colonic mucosa of patients with active untreated inflammatory bowel disease. Colonic mucosal biopsy specimens were obtained during colonoscopy from 17 patients with ulcerative colitis, eight patients with Crohn's disease of the colon, and 16 normal control subjects. Interleukin 1 content was determined in fresh and 24 hour organ cultured mucosa as well as in cultured medium. Interleukin 1 content and release were significantly higher in the inflamed mucosa compared with that of control subjects. Prednisolone inhibited interleukin 1 release in a dose dependent fashion. We conclude that colonic mucosal interleukin 1 content and production is significantly raised in active inflammatory bowel disease and may have a role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response. Pharmacological suppression of tissue interleukin 1 production may have a beneficial therapeutic effect.\r"

A soluble form of IL2R has recently been described whose proposed role is to downregulate T cell activation by competing for interleukin 2. We investigated whether a deficiency of soluble IL2R could account for the high concentrations of IL2R positive T lymphocytes in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. Soluble IL2R was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum of 16 children with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis, eight with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B virus infection, seven with Wilson's disease, nine with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, and 15 healthy age matched controls. Soluble IL2R concentration was significantly higher in patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis than in healthy controls (mean (SEM) 475 (75) U/ml, 145 (8) U/ml respectively, p less than 0.01). Eleven patients who had active disease had significantly higher soluble IL2R concentrations (590 (89) U/ml) than the five cases with inactive disease (220 (36) U/ml, p less than 0.01). No difference was found between the controls and the patients with chronic liver disease due to hepatitis B infection, Wilson's disease, and alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Percentages and absolute numbers of surface IL2R positive T cells as detected by immunofluorescence were significantly higher in the patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (11.8% (1); 274/microliters (31)) than in controls (0.2% (0.1); 5/microliters (2), p less than 0.001), the highest values being found in those with uncontrolled disease.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We measured polymorphonuclear cell, mononuclear cell, plasma, and erythrocyte zinc values, and erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase activity to assess zinc status in 17 patients with non-alcoholic liver disease (primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis) and 13 patients with alcoholic liver disease. The plasma zinc concentration was reduced in both patient groups and correlated strongly with the plasma albumin concentration. The mean polymorphonuclear cell zinc value in both groups was similar to that of controls but when results were combined and grouped according to hepatic functional reserve, patients with more severe liver damage (grade C) had a lower polymorphonuclear cell zinc value (mean (SD) 0.86 (0.24) nmol/mg protein) than patients with grade A (1.44 (0.43) nmol/mg protein, p less than 0.01) or grade B liver damage (1.08 (0.30) nmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05), or control subjects (1.26 (0.28) nmol/mg protein, p less than 0.001). The polymorphonuclear cell zinc value did not correlate with other indices of zinc status. The mononuclear cell zinc value was normal in all patients and was unrelated to hepatic damage. The erythrocyte zinc value and carbonic anhydrase activity were raised in alcoholic patients only. Since the polymorphonuclear cell zinc concentration is low in human experimental zinc deficiency and also correlates with tissue zinc, we suggest that our results provide evidence of progressive leucocyte zinc depletion in patients with liver disease.\r"
