In some cases, reactivity is dominantly influenced by one or a limited number of amino acid substitutions in the MHC molecule. Combinatorial epitopes that are dependent upon both alpha and beta chains can also be generated. MHC products, even from distinctive evolutionary backgrounds, may exhibit large regions of shared sequence, explaining patterns of clonal reactivity that would indicate the presence of shared epitopes. In other cases, epitopes may be truly cross reactive in nature, without regions of shared sequence. Indeed a limited number of clones may actually recognize either a class I or a class II MHC product. Finally, there are some patterns of clonal reactivity that cannot be explained by known structural variations. These clones either may recognize mixed class II dimers or may be influenced by peptide fragments presented in the groove of MHC gene products. This latter issue in particular requires a careful reconsideration of the process of allorecognition.\r"

Planar RBC imaging followed by blood-pool SPECT scanning was performed in 77 patients with a total of 108 hemangiomas and in 29 patients with a total of 46 hepatocellular carcinomas. All lesions were smaller than 5 cm in diameter. Thirty-six (33%) of 108 hemangiomas were detected by planar delayed RBC imaging, whereas 63 (58%) were detected by the delayed RBC-SPECT scan. The smallest hemangioma shown by delayed RBC-SPECT scanning was 1.4 cm in diameter, compared with 1.7 cm by planar RBC scanning. When confined to nodules larger than 1.4 cm in diameter, 42% of hemangiomas (36/85) were detected by planar delayed RBC imaging, whereas 74% (63/85) were detected by delayed RBC-SPECT. Increase in sensitivity was noted in nodules 2.1-4.0 cm in diameter. No hepatocellular carcinomas were shown by delayed RBC planar or SPECT scans. We concluded that with the addition of SPECT, the sensitivity of delayed RBC scans in the detection of small hemangiomas is considerably improved. Delayed RBC-SPECT scanning can be used to distinguish hemangioma from hepatocellular carcinoma.\r"

The effect of baseline exercise-induced ischemia on the response to a 12-week conditioning program was evaluated in 106 coronary patients. The magnitude of exercise conditioning response was greater in nonischemic patients than in ischemic patients, with maximal exercise intensity increasing 69 versus 50% (7.2 to 12.1 vs 7.1 to 10.6 METs) (p less than 0.05) and maximal oxygen consumption increasing 28 versus 10% (23.1 to 29.6 vs 23.0 to 25.4 cc/kg/min) (p less than 0.05). Markers of conditioning during submaximal exercise such as heart rate and heart rate-systolic blood pressure product were similarly reduced in both groups. The groups did not differ by age, diagnosis, resting ejection fraction, incidence of beta-blocker use, maximal exercise capacity, maximal exercise heart rate, blood pressure or intensity of actual exercise training. These results suggest that exercise-induced ischemia alters the stimulus to adapt to exercise training.\r"

Balloon angioplasty is the surgical treatment of choice, but coronary artery bypass may be performed when necessary. In most patients older than 65 years, the rate of progression of atherosclerosis is slow, and additional surgical treatment may not be required for many years. In the elderly, atherosclerosis is often found in more than 1 of the 4 major arterial beds. About 15% of patients with coronary artery disease requiring operation have atherosclerosis in a second major arterial bed. Previously unpublished data on risk factors and survival rates in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass surgery are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "The gene CYP21B, encoding the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme of adrenal steroid biosynthesis, has been mapped to the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Deficiency of this enzyme leads to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). We report the phenotypes of the HLA and complement C4 and Bf genes, which are closely linked to the CYP21B gene, together with a detailed analysis of the CYP21 and C4 RFLP, in 17 Finnish families with CAH. The RFLP analysis with six restriction enzymes suggested that, altogether, 35% of the affected chromosomes had a CYP21B + C4B gene deletion, 9% an obvious gene conversion of the CYP21B gene to a CYP21A-like gene, and 3% a CYP21A + C4B duplication. The remaining 53% gave the RFLP patterns also found in nonaffected chromosomes. We also found that a 14.0-kb EcoRI RFLP marker of the CYP21 genes was strongly associated with the presence of a short C4B gene, suggesting that some of the RFLP markers found with the CYP21 probe may actually derive from C4B gene polymorphism. Three particular MHC haplotypes, each with a characteristic RFLP pattern, were found in many unrelated families. These three haplotypes accounted for 59% of the affected chromosomes in our study group, the rest (41%) of the affected chromosomes being distributed among various subtypes. The results suggest that, within a single, well-defined population such as in Finland, only a few CYP21B gene defects may constitute a substantial part of the affected chromosomes. This finding will help in genetic studies of CAH in such populations.\r"

Although the disease has been provisionally mapped to proximal Xq, high lethality and lack of a carrier test have limited the number of scorable meioses. We performed linkage analysis in six new kindreds with X-linked SCID, using a random pattern of T-cell X inactivation to rule out the carrier state in at-risk women. Our linkage results, combined with analysis of Xq interstitial deletions, confirmed the regional assignment of X-linked SCID, narrowed the boundaries within which this locus lies to Xq13.1-q21.1, and established the locus order DXS159-(PGK1, SCID)-DXS72-DXS3, defining flanking markers for prenatal diagnosis and carrier testing.\r"

The authors have measured B cell growth factor (BCGF)-induced proliferation in B lymphocytes isolated from 28 patients with malignancies representing different stages of B cell differentiation. The phorbol ester TPA (12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate), a potent mitogen and inducer of BCGF receptor expression in normal B cells, was added in combination with BCGF to enhance the proliferative response. These results show that many neoplastic B cells are able to respond to BCGF (32%), particularly when combined with TPA (63%). The response was variable in frequency and magnitude within clinicopathologic groups; cells from patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were more refractory to stimulation than those from acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). An attenuated response to BCGF plus TPA was observed in neoplastic cells with high rates of spontaneous DNA synthesis from all histologic categories. These observations suggest that some maximally stimulated cells appear incapable of responding to additional exogenous growth stimuli. Within apparently homogeneous clinicopathologic groups, distinct subgroups of B cell neoplasms can be defined by cellular responses to BCGF. The correlation of this biologic feature with the clinical behavior of the neoplasm requires additional study.\r"

When compared with saline controls the FGS rats had decreased rates of glomerular attachment and significantly reduced outgrowths of type 1 (epithelial) and type II (mesangial) cells. However, the FGS rats had greater numbers of type III cells (macrophages) present in the outgrowths than controls. The production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the glomerular culture supernatant, measured by thymocyte stimulating activity, was determined at various stages throughout the evolution of FGS and in saline controls. The FGS glomeruli early in the disease course (day 10) had higher levels of IL-1 activity than glomerular outgrowths from control rats but significantly lower levels of IL-1 were produced late in the disease (day 80). Glomerular macrophages were present throughout the evolution of the disease but in greater numbers early (day 10). In this experimental model of FGS, IL-1 production, has been demonstrated early in the disease process, could originate from macrophages and/or mesangial cells, and could be involved in the progressive glomerulosclerosis.\r"

Logistic regression analysis, adjusting for multiple confounders, revealed exposure odds ratios of 2.8 (1.1, 7.0) and 13.5 (2.1, 87.6) in these same groups, respectively, and a dose-response relationship between olfactory dysfunction and cumulative exposure scores--semi-quantitative indices of lifetime exposure to the acrylates. The data also revealed decreasing exposure odds ratios with increasing duration since last exposure to these chemicals, suggesting that the effects may be reversible.\r"

Findings also suggest that use of hearing protection may reduce the risk of hearing loss among students who work on the farm, although few students report the use of such devices.

A predictable steady state concentration was achieved in the prebypass period with a maintenance infusion rate of 3 mg/kg/hour. The onset of bypass resulted in a small decrease in propofol concentration as a result of haemodilution. Induced hypothermia resulted in an increase in propofol concentration which returned rapidly to the prebypass steady state value during rewarming.

However, this analysis found minimal differences in the incidence of hypertension between men and women for all age groups. Incidence rates for blacks were at least twice the rates for whites for almost every age-sex group. Decreased survival in older hypertensive men probably explained the higher prevalence in older women.

Exocrine pancreatic impairment was found to be present in 63% of the patients.

Functional pancreatic impairment tended to be more severe in patients with longer disease duration and it was related to the degree of alteration of salivary flow but not to labial salivary gland histologic changes or the type of SS. Inasmuch as hypertrypsinemia was the common marker of pancreatic dysfunction in all patients, we suggest a periodic measurement of serum IRT levels in the follow-up of patients with SS to detect early stages of pancreatic involvement.\r"

Ganciclovir, a guanosine analogue, inhibits CMV replication in vitro and in vivo, and its use can stabilize the clinical course of an affected patient. We examined the changes in body composition that occurred in four untreated patients and in eight patients who were treated with ganciclovir for serious CMV infections. Untreated patients lost weight, depleted body cell mass, as determined from total-body potassium measurements in a whole-body counter, lost body fat, as estimated from anthropometric measurements, and had a progressive fall in serum albumin concentration. In contrast, treated patients gained weight, repleted body cell mass and body fat, and increased serum albumin concentration during a three-month follow-up. In this study, it was estimated that ganciclovir therapy resulted in a net energy conservation of 2629 kJ/d. The ability to promote body cell mass repletion may be considered a demonstration of the efficacy of ganciclovir in the treatment of serious CMV infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To explore the possibility that the mechanism of action of methotrexate (MTX) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is related to modulation of interleukin-1 (IL-1), the effects of MTX on IL-1 production and activity were evaluated. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and murine peritoneal and splenic cells were stimulated by lipopolysaccharide to produce IL-1. No inhibition of IL-1 synthesis or secretion caused by MTX treatment could be demonstrated either in vitro or in vivo, in patients with RA or in mice treated with MTX. We did show, however, that MTX had an inhibitory effect on IL-1 activity in 2 assays that demonstrate 2 different functions of IL-1. In a 2-step assay using LBRM-33-1A5 (1A5) and CTLD cells, MTX inhibited the secretion of IL-2 by 1A5 lymphoma cells in response to phytohemagglutinin and IL-1. In an assay using D10.G4.1 (D10) cells, MTX inhibited IL-1-induced proliferation of the D10 T cell clone. No effect of the drug on IL-2 activity was observed. The results demonstrate that MTX is capable of inhibiting some IL-1 activities without affecting IL-1 production or secretion. We propose that the inhibition of IL-1 activity or IL-1-dependent events may be one of the mechanisms of action of MTX in RA.\r"

  ".W": "Methotrexate was added to cultured mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of normal individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) to study the drug's effects on mononuclear cell proliferation and antibody synthesis. In the presence of methotrexate, marked antiproliferative effects (to levels less than 15% of baseline) were seen with 3H-deoxyuridine, but not with 3H-thymidine, as the marker of cell division. This difference was not due to altered kinetics of proliferation or the presence of salvage nucleotides in the culture medium. The absence of suppression of antibody production preactivated by pokeweed mitogen in vitro and the low levels of suppression of spontaneous IgM rheumatoid factor production by blood mononuclear cells from RA patients suggested a relative resistance of activated cells to the effects of methotrexate. The effects of methotrexate on both cell proliferation and antibody synthesis were completely reversed by the addition of high concentrations of exogenous folinic acid. The results suggest that methotrexate has effects on immunocompetent cells that may contribute to the efficacy of this drug in the treatment of RA and other autoimmune diseases.\r"

The decrease in this T cell subset was most frequent and most marked in patients with active SLE and renal disease. In the present study, we attempted to determine whether SLE patients had plasma antilymphocyte antibodies preferentially reactive with the CD4+2H4+ subset. We found that many SLE patients did have these specifically reactive antibodies. Furthermore, the presence of antilymphocyte antibodies reactive with CD4+2H4+ cells correlated with disease activity in these patients. Also, in vitro functional studies revealed that suppressor/inducer function was eliminated in the pokeweed mitogen-driven IgG synthesis system after the treatment of CD4 cells with patient plasma antilymphocyte antibodies and complement. These results suggest that antilymphocyte antibodies play a role in the elimination of CD4+2H4+ cells in patients with active SLE.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the expression and function of 2 cell surface markers that induce T cell activation, CD3 and CD5, in 19 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS). The expression of CD3+ lymphocytes was normal, but CD3 function was moderately reduced, as measured by anti-CD3-induced T cell proliferation. Anti-CD3-induced stimulation of T cell help for Ig production and non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted (natural) killing were normal. In contrast, there was reduced expression and function of the CD5 molecule on peripheral blood lymphocytes of the SS patients. The ratio of CD5+ to CD3+ lymphocytes was 0.45 in SS patients compared with 0.85 in normal subjects, indicating that the CD3+ cells are relatively CD5-deficient in SS patients. Anti-CD5 monoclonal antibody did not augment suboptimal anti-CD3 stimulation of whole peripheral blood lymphocytes or of purified T lymphocytes from SS patients, which indicated impaired functioning of the CD5 molecule. A significant impairment in proliferation was found in response to phorbol myristate acetate and to ionomycin in combination, suggesting defective intracellular signaling. Findings from serial studies of individual patients suggested that normal or low expression of CD5 on T cells can be stable over periods as long as 2 years. However, in 2 patients who required systemic therapy, a correction of the CD5 lymphocyte abnormality occurred in association with clinical remission, which suggests the potential reversibility of this condition. Our findings suggest a possible defect in intracellular signaling in primary SS, related in part to the CD5 molecule, which may provide a molecular explanation for the T cell hyporesponsiveness that is characteristic of this disease.\r"

An inflammatory infiltrate composed of B lymphocytes and null cells, in addition to T lymphocytes, Langerhans cells, and polymorphs, was present in the epithelium as well as in the stroma of the limbic conjunctiva.

In these animals, total clinical recovery from complete paraplegia may occur as early as 4 days after the onset of hindlimb weakness. These studies indicate that this recovery occurs at a time when there is restoration of nerve conduction in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) and when most demyelinated fibres have been invested, and some partially remyelinated, by Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes in the PNS and CNS, respectively. These findings support the hypothesis that the neurological signs of acute EAE are due to demyelination in the PNS and CNS.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the effects of a partial cholinergic deafferentation on the functional activity of the cortex, the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlu) was measured with positron emission tomography and 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose in 5 baboons (Papio anubis) both before and serially following stereotaxic electrocoagulation of the left nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM). Four days postlesion, significant metabolic depression was present in the entire ipsilateral cerebral cortex, most marked in the frontotemporal region, and which slowly recovered close to normal within 6-13 weeks. Postmortem studies showed that the lesions were located largely in the NbM, and that a significant decrease in choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity was present in the ipsilateral frontal, temporal and parietal cortices. The animal with the most limited histological lesion showed the least decrease in both ChAT activity and CMRGlu. There was a highly significant linear correlation between the regional cortical decreases in CMRGlu (early postlesion data) and in ChAT activity. These results indicate that cholinergic deafferentation induces a proportional metabolic depression in the cortex. However, compensatory mechanisms operate to restore the cortical metabolic activity gradually despite sustained cholinergic denervation, pointing to pre- and/or postsynaptic adaptation (plasticity). Moreover, unilateral NbM lesions also induced a significant reduction in contralateral CMRGlu, which also demonstrated recovery. Several mechanisms are discussed to explain this contralateral effect, but the most likely implicates a transcallosal depression of function as a result of ipsilateral effects of the NbM lesion. These metabolic effects of cholinergic deafferentation in the primate provide new insight into the mechanisms of cortical dysfunction, and the recovery thereof, following subcortical lesions. In addition, our findings have some relevance to the cortical consequences of cholinergic deafferentation observed in dementia of Alzheimer type.\r"

Injection with 5 x 10(6) line cells induced EAE with a rapidly developing tetraplegia after a latent period of 4 days. Electrophysiological testing revealed a profound slowing of afferent conduction within the dorsal column of the spinal cord, and conduction abnormalities in the spinal roots. Injection with a lower cell dose of 1 x 10(6) T line cells caused only moderate clinical signs paralleled by milder conduction slowing and conduction failure. Light microscopy showed marked inflammation with infiltration of mononuclear cells and some demyelination throughout the spinal cord and roots. Inflammation and demyelination were dose dependent and the caudal parts of the spinal cord were more affected than the cranial parts. The peripheral nerves were free of electrophysiological and morphological alterations. Systemic treatment with 4-aminopyridine accelerated and partially restored conduction in the dorsal columns and roots, while increasing the body temperature had a detrimental effect, suggesting demyelination as a prominent pathophysiological mechanism. These findings show that in AT-EAE in Lewis rats the dysfunction of the central nervous system and of spinal roots is cell dose dependent, that the peripheral nervous system distal to the spinal roots is spared, and suggest that paranodal demyelination is an important pathogenic mechanism.\r"

In this study we evaluated complement activation (C3a and C4a) by the heparin-protamine complex in 46 consecutive patients (40 received protamine sulfate to reverse heparin, and six did not) during and after coronary angiography. In patients receiving protamine sulfate, there was a significant increase in C3a over the value before protamine sulfate administration (P less than .001) or in patients who did not receive protamine sulfate (P less than .05): 807 +/- 100 ng/ml vs. 274 +/- 75 ng/ml. There were no significant changes in C4a after protamine sulfate administration. These results indicate that the alternate complement pathway is activated when protamine sulfate is administered after coronary angiography. This may induce hypotension as well as platelet aggregation and thrombus formation and may contribute to coronary instability. Therefore, in unstable patients, heparin reversal by protamine should not be done routinely.\r"

The eligible families were visited by the trained interviewers. A loglinear model shows no interaction on a multiplicative scale between these two factors on the frequency of hospitalization for respiratory illness during the first 18 months of life. However, the synergism of passive smoking and artificial feeding on the consequence was detected by using Rothman's approach that these two synergistic agents worked together producing a detrimental effect much more than that expected by their separate actions. These data suggested that it is more important to stop smoking in the families where the infants were artificially fed.\r"

Nude mice transplanted with EC-GI cells invariably developed hypercalcemia, although their urinary cAMP excretion remained within the normal range. IL-1 alpha or PTH-rP-(1-34) stimulated 45Ca release from prelabeled fetal mouse forearm bones in a concentration-dependent manner, and when combined, IL-1 alpha and PTH-rP-(1-34) synergistically stimulated bone resorption in vitro. Injection of PTH-rP-(1-34) into mice three times a day for 2 days increased the serum calcium concentration in a dose-dependent manner. Continuous infusion of IL-1 alpha occasionally increased the serum calcium concentration. Simultaneous administration of IL-1 alpha at rates of 1-2.7 micrograms/day and PTH-rP-(1-34) at doses of 15-30 micrograms/day synergistically increased the serum calcium concentration in vivo. These findings suggest that PTH-rP and IL-1 alpha produced by the tumor cells were synergistically responsible for the humoral hypercalcemia observed in both the original patient and the tumor-bearing nude mice, and that at least two bone-resorbing factors [PTH-rP and another nonadenylate cyclase-stimulating bone-resorbing factor(s)] are active in patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcemia, in whom nephrogenous cAMP excretion is neither increased nor decreased.\r"

To observe whether these changes are reversible, we have investigated the consequences of the administration and withdrawal of CsA immunotherapy on bone mineral metabolism. Three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were studied for 28 days. Group A received vehicle, and group B received CsA (15 mg/kg BW) for 28 days, while group C received CsA (15 mg/kg BW) for 14 days and then vehicle from days 15-28 by daily gavage. Serum ionized calcium (Ca2+), PTH, bone gla protein, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, magnesium, phosphorus, and 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D were measured weekly. Bone histomorphometry was analyzed on days 14 and 28 in groups A and B and on day 28 in group C. CsA administration resulted in reversible hypomagnesemia and mild transient elevation in circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels with no change in Ca2+, PTH, blood urea nitrogen, or phosphorus. Serum bone gla protein levels were significantly increased (P less than 0.002) during CsA therapy, but tended to return to control values after CsA withdrawal. Enhanced bone remodeling and significant trabecular bone loss accompanied CsA administration. Withdrawal of CsA resulted in all of the histomorphometric parameters, except for bone volume, returning to control values within 2 weeks. Incomplete restoration of bone volume occurred 5 weeks after CsA withdrawal. This limited restoration of bone volume despite CsA withdrawal may have important clinical implications.\r"

  ".W": "Mevinolin, putatively a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase, was used to assess the contribution of de novo synthesized cholesterol to androgen production by ovarian thecal cells in vitro. Enzymatically dispersed thecal cells from 3- to 6-mm follicles of prepubertal gilts were incubated at 150,000 cells/ml with a maximally effective dose of LH (250 ng/ml) for 24 h. Mevinolin (3-50 microM) caused dose-dependent inhibition of androstenedione production. Addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol (0.025-25 microM) failed to restore androstenedione production to levels seen in the absence of mevinolin, suggesting an additional site of action of mevinolin beyond 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase. The site of this inhibitory effect was determined by measuring steroid products formed in the presence of relevant steroid precursors. Mevinolin (12 microM) inhibited the production of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone from progesterone and that of androstenedione from 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, while 25-hydroxycholesterol to progesterone and pregnenolone to progesterone conversions were unimpaired. That mevinolin did not affect 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase:delta 5-delta 4-isomerase reactions was confirmed by demonstrating that conversions of pregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone, and dehydroepiandrosterone to progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and androstenedione, respectively, were not affected by 12 microM mevinolin. These results indicate that mevinolin has an additional inhibitory action at the level of the 17 alpha-hydroxylase:C-17,20-lyase complex. The degree of inhibition of androstenedione production was not decreased with increased concentrations of progesterone or 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone substrate, suggesting that the inhibition was not competitive in nature. As the dose of mevinolin was increased up to 50 microM, progesterone accumulation was unaffected, but pregnenolone concentrations in medium greatly increased. While the mechanism of this effect is unclear, this finding suggests that preformed intracellular cholesterol, rather than that synthesized de novo, is supplying steroidogenic substrate in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "The actions of opioids and opiates on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis are currently controversial. In the rat, morphine is reported to both stimulate and inhibit ACTH and corticosterone secretion, but the precise sites and mechanisms of these effects have remained unclear. To analyze further the hypothalamic actions of morphine, we have investigated its effect on hypothalamic fragments in vitro and measured the major CRF, CRF-41, by a specific RIA. The acute effects of morphine on both basal and stimulated ACTH release from dispersed pituitary cells were also investigated. Morphine (10(-8)-10(-6) M) did not significantly alter the basal secretion of CRF-41. However, similar concentrations of morphine inhibited CRF-41 release stimulated by norepinephrine in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, morphine (10(-6) M) inhibited acetylcholine (10(-9) M)- and serotonin (10(-7) M)-stimulated CRF-41 release. The stimulatory effect on CRF-41 release induced by veratridine (10(-6) M) was inhibited by approximately 50% in the presence of morphine. KCl (28 nM)-mediated CRF-41 release was also significantly inhibited by morphine. Naloxone (10(-7)-10(-5) M) had no significant effect on either basal or norepinephrine-induced CRF-41 release, but reversed the inhibitory effect of morphine on norepinephrine-induced CRF-41 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Morphine (10(-6)-10(-5) M) had no effect on either basal or CRF-41-stimulated ACTH release from dispersed pituitary cells. These data suggest that the predominant effect of morphine on hypothalamic CRF-41 release in vitro is suppression of the release induced by a variety of putative neurotransmitters and depolarizing agents. This inhibitory effect is reversed by naloxone, suggesting that it is mediated by opiate receptors, presumably situated directly on CRF-41 neurons.\r"

In lactating females, however, the corticosterone response to this stress failed to reach significance, the plasma oxytocin response was markedly reduced, and the vasopressin response was unaffected. Lactation also resulted in an abolition of the CRF and enkephalin mRNA responses to stress. In contrast, the hypothalamic CRF response to adrenalectomy was unaffected by lactation status. Removal of the pups from their mothers resulted in a return of CRF and enkephalin mRNA responses to stress within 2 days. Lactation is associated with a selective inhibition of normal hypothalamic stress responses.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of PTH on the binding and mitogenic activity of epidermal growth factor (EGF) were studied in clonal, PTH- and EGF-responsive mouse osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. Treatment of cells with synthetic rat PTH-(1-34) at 10(-10)-10(-8) M resulted in a dose-related decrease (maximally 30% relative to the control value) in the specific binding of a biologically active, 125I-iodolabeled derivative of recombinant human EGF ([125I]iodo-EGF). The PTH-induced decrease in EGF binding was time dependent, requiring at least 4 h of PTH treatment at 37 C for a maximal effect, completely reversible after cessation of PTH exposure and specific only to biologically active PTH. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding data revealed that the PTH-induced reduction of EGF binding was accounted for by a proportional decrease in the available EGF-binding sites without an alteration in binding affinity (Kd = 0.7-0.8 nM). PTH treatment resulted ina concomitant decrease in mitotic responsiveness to EGF (maximally 40-50% of control). Both of these down-regulatory effects of PTH were closely mimicked by forskolin, cholera toxin, or (Bu)2cAMP. Addition of either colchicine or cytochalasin-B during PTH treatment completely abolished the PTH-induced reduction of EGF binding. These data indicate that PTH down-regulates EGF receptors and reduces the mitotic responsiveness to EGF, probably via a cAMP-dependent cytoskeleton-mediated mechanism(s) in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells.\r"

  ".U": "89210521\r", 
  ".W": "In premetamorphic tadpoles precocious metamorphosis can be induced by immersion in water containing either T4 or T3. T3 5-deiodinase (5D) activity is present in most tissues, and T4 5'-deiodinase (5'D) activity is present in gut and skin; both systems can be inhibited by iopanoic acid (IOP). If conversion of T4 to T3 is important for the normal physiological action of T4 in these tadpoles, it follows that IOP should decrease the effects of T4 and increase those of T3 on metamorphic events. To test this, tadpoles were immersed in water containing either T4 or T3 (20 nM) with or without 1.75 microM IOP. Two indices of metamorphosis, increased leg length and hepatic carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity, were studied. In vehicle- or IOP-treated animals, change in leg length and carbamyl phosphate synthetase activity were minimal. Both indices were increased after exposure to T3 for 10 days or to T4 for 21 days. Moreover, the effects of T3 were significantly enhanced while those of T4 were inhibited when IOP was also present. Both 5'D and 5D activities determined in vitro were inhibited (95% and 60%, respectively) in IOP-treated tadpoles, and this was associated with an increase in the plasma concentration of hormone. In separate experiments, vehicle- and IOP-treated tadpoles received [125I]T4 or [125I]T3 ip. Plasma, liver, gut, and skin were examined 12-24 h later for 125I-labeled products. After [125I]T4 treatment [125I]T3 was found in skin and gut, but not in plasma or liver. After [125I]T3 treatment [125I]3,3'-diiodothyronine was identified in all extracts studied. In vivo generation of these products was reduced by 50% in IOP-treated tadpoles. These findings indicate that generation of T3 from T4 can take place in vivo in the premetamorphic tadpole and strongly support the hypothesis that this process plays an important role in the physiological action of T4 in this species.\r"

Oral administration of these vitamin D3 compounds augmented the primary immune response, induced by immunization with a suboptimal number of sheep erythrocytes, without inducing hypercalcemia.

Mononuclear cells were isolated on Ficoll-hypaque density gradients. T cells, B cells, and T cell subsets were identified by the specific immunobead rosette technique. Mononuclear cells 1 x 10(6) were cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium and stimulated in the presence or absence of pokeweed mitogen. Immunoglobulin production was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Increased amounts of immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG and IgA were demonstrated in the peritoneal cell cultures (P less than 0.05), whereas peripheral blood cell cultures showed only an increase in IgG in patients with endometriosis (P less than 0.05). There was an increase in the number of T cells, B cells, and the ratio of CD4/CD8 lymphocytes in endometriosis compared with control patients (P less than 0.005) in both peritoneal fluid and peripheral blood. This study suggests that immunoglobulin production by the \"activated\" B cells may be regulated by the increased presence of T cells, specifically the helper cells (CD4) in endometriosis.\r"

Resistance to proteolytic degradation in the stomach is necessary if ingested EGF is to function within the gastrointestinal tract. Although EGF stability to low pH and proteases predicts gastric survival, the extent of digestion in the stomach remains to be defined. Consequently, we measured gastric degradation of 125I-human recombinant EGF in preterm infants with an in vitro method in which EGF was incubated at 37 degrees C with stomach fluid at pH 1.8, 3.2, and 5.8 followed by analysis of degradation products. As maximal acid proteolytic activity is present one hour after feeding in preterm infants, fluid was obtained at that time from 18 infants with a mean gestational age at birth of 30.4 (3.0) (SD) weeks and a postnatal age of 26.3 (12.7) days at sampling. Incubations for up to 60 minutes revealed minimal loss of trichloroacetic acid precipitable radioactivity, in contrast to the substantial hydrolysis of iodinated casein which occurred under the same conditions. Chromatography of reaction mixtures on Sephadex G-25 showed a single major peak of radioactivity which coeluted with EGF. Epidermal growth factor also retained greater than 75% of its ability to bind to anti-EGF affinity columns and placental membrane receptors after incubation with gastric fluid. These data support the concept of substantial gastric survival of ingested EGF in a potentially biologically active form in preterm infants.\r"

  ".W": "Studies of the morphologic and phenotypic diversity of intraepithelial T cells in human small intestine have shown them to be heterogeneous, yet distinct from most extra intestinal T cells. In this study sequential immunoenzymatic staining was used to define new intraepithelial lymphocyte subpopulations in man. In normal human jejunum approximately 6% of the intraepithelial T cells expressing CD3 (an antigen associated with the T cell receptor) do not express the T cell subset antigens CD4 or CD8. Approximately 20% of CD7+ cells (T cells and null cells) do not express CD4 or CD8 and 14% of the CD7+ cells do not express CD3 and are therefore not T cells. The CD7+, CD3+/-, CD4-, CD8- population is concentrated in the tips of the villi. In coeliac disease, the ratios of the subsets change significantly. The percentage of CD3+, 4-, 8- cells increases to 28%, the proportion of CD7+, 4-, 8- cells remains unchanged and the CD7+, CD3- (non-T cell) population is reduced to 1.4% of the CD7+ cells. In contrast, in patients with villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology, all CD4-, CD8- lymphocyte subsets are decreased compared with normal biopsies. Finally, in enteropathy associated T cell lymphoma (malignant histiocytosis of the intestine) in which the 'uninvolved mucosa' is histologically similar to untreated coeliac disease, the changes in the intraepithelial T cell sub-sets are indistinguishable from those in coeliac disease, suggesting that the lymphoma is a complication of coeliac disease.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro secretion of immunoglobulins by small intestinal lymphocytes isolated from 47 patients with normal histology and 23 patients with treated and untreated coeliac disease was examined using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. In control patients, duodenal lymphocytes spontaneously secreted higher levels of IgM than jejunal lymphocytes (p less than 0.05). Significantly higher levels of both IgA (p less than 0.05) and IgM (p less than 0.001) were secreted by jejunal lymphocytes of 10 patients with untreated coeliac disease than cells isolated from normal jejunal tissue. IgM and IgA secretion by duodenal lymphocytes isolated from control patients was increased in a dose dependent manner by coculture with autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes. This effect was not observed with jejunal lymphocytes of control or treated coeliac patients. Peripheral T-cells of untreated coeliac patients, however, showed significant helper effects (p less than 0.05) for IgM and IgA secretion by autologous jejunal lymphocytes. The results suggest that jejunal lymphocytes of patients with untreated coeliac disease show major differences in their capacity to synthesise and secrete immunoglobulins in vitro and the enhanced secretion might result from changes in T-cell immunoregulatory function.\r"

The frequency of extrahepatic organ toxicity was increased in patients with elevated levels. Symptomatic \"hepatitis\" developed in 3% of this series and in less than 1% of cases in the literature. Evidence of hepatic phospholipidosis and the development of pseudoalcoholic liver injury is most likely due to the biochemical effects of the drug and to possible metabolic idiosyncrasy, respectively. Serial blood enzyme measurements, as recommended by the manufacturer, may offer some protection against the development of more serious liver injury. However, levels of amiodarone may persist in various tissues for weeks to months following withdrawal, and stopping the drug does not guarantee the prompt reversal of any organ toxicity. Accordingly, the risks posed and benefits offered by amiodarone should be carefully weighed prior to discontinuing the drug, as the risk of sudden cardiac death may outweigh the hazards of ongoing hepatic, pulmonary or other toxicity.\r"

Patients in group three received detoxification (when necessary), amitriptyline in (some cases), and TENS without other modalities of physical therapy. Patients in groups two and three, as judged by changes in Headache Index, showed a significantly faster and greater decline in headaches than patients in group one, and maintained this excellent relief through the six month follow-up period. From a biochemical perspective, this improvement may be related to the demonstrable increase in serotonin levels that attends TENS. From a behavioural perspective, improvement may be related to the change in \"locus of control\" from the headache to the patient that attends the more \"active\" modalities of TENS and physical therapy, as opposed to the more \"passive\" modality of medication alone.\r"

Lymphokine-Activated Killer (LAK) cells can be generated by incubation of human PBL in recombinant Interleukin-2 (rIL-2). This phenomenon was studied in 10 CH patients and 8 healthy volunteers. PBL were activated to LAK cells by \"in vitro\" incubation for 72 hours in Control Medium containing rIL-2 (1000 I.U./ml). A four hour Chromium 51 release was used to measure LAK Cell Killing of K562 target cells. The released radioactivity was measured in a gamma scintillation counter. The CH patients showed a marked increase of LAK generation compared to control subjects. This effect seems to be augmented during the cluster period.\r"

Although CGRP and C have a wide intrapulmonary distribution, their actions have not been well defined. By the use of a computerized lung mechanics analyzer, changes in response to 10-min infusions of these agents were measured in spontaneously breathing, anesthetized guinea pigs. Infusion of 0.3 nmol.kg-1.min-1 CGRP and 2 nmol.kg-1.min-1 C caused little change in lung mechanics. Infusion of 0.06 nmol.kg-1.min-1 B and 0.3 nmol.kg-1.min-1 SP caused a marked increase in inspiratory, expiratory, and total pulmonary resistance (RT), from base-line values (P less than 0.02), with a maximal effect at 10 min postinfusion (PI) [RT = 326 +/- 20% (SE) (B), 490 +/- 73% (SP)]. Coinfusion of C or CGRP with B or SP at the above concentrations caused a marked reduction in SP - [RT = 189 +/- 28% (C), 142 +/- 16% (CGRP) at 10 min PI] and B - [RT = 157 +/- 18% (C), 158 +/- 10% (CGRP) at 10 min PI] induced changes in resistance (P less than 0.015). The mode of action of C and CGRP is unknown, but these peptides may antagonize the effects of B and SP via autonomic pathways by interfering with B- or SP-induced changes in intracellular calcium concentrations or by increasing intracellular cAMP levels by binding to specific cellular receptors linked to adenylate cyclase.\r"

Mucus glycoconjugate release from submucosal glands of feline trachea was examined using [3H]glucosamine as a mucus precursor. Isolated glands showed significantly higher secretory responses to cholinergic, alpha-, and beta-adrenergic agonists and dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (average 400% of control) than the conventional tracheal mucosal explants, which contained epithelium and submucosal tissues in addition to submucosal glands (average 160% of control). The addition of isolated epithelium depressed the secretory response of isolated glands to the same level as that of tracheal explants. However, the supernatant from isolated epithelium failed to inhibit secretory responses to methacholine in isolated glands, suggesting that the epithelium-derived inhibitory factor to secretion may be short-lived. Leukotriene D4 antagonist (FPL 55712), cyclooxygenase and/or lipoxygenase inhibitors (indomethacin or BW 755C) caused no significant change in the inhibitory action of epithelium, suggesting that the inhibition is not due to arachidonic acid metabolites. The newly found secretory inhibitory action of epithelium is of particular interest in the pathogenesis of hypersecretion associated with epithelial damage.\r"

To examine the immunoregulatory potential of this molecule, suppressive activity of sera from patients with major burns (n = 16; 40% to 80% total body surface area) was assessed before and after immunoaffinity adsorption with interleukin-2. The preadsorption level of interleukin-2 receptor in the pooled serum after burn injury was 6250 U/ml. This serum demonstrated a strong suppressive activity, inhibiting expression of cellular interleukin-2 receptor and proliferative responses of normal human lymphocytes to alloantigen and exogenous interleukin-2 by 60% to 90%. Adsorption of pooled serum after burn injury with interleukin-2 lowered the level of interleukin-2 receptor to 1800 U/ml and reduced its immunosuppressive activity. The percentage of interleukin-2 receptor-bearing cells, and cell proliferative responses, increased by 50% to 70% compared with sham adsorbed pooled serum after burn injury. Thus serum interleukin-2 receptor after burn injury may represent a specific mediator for downregulation of interleukin-2-dependent responses.\r"

Triplicate samples of 10% dilutions of burn serum from nine burn patients (three with greater than 60% burn) were analyzed for their ability to suppress mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis. A separate aliquot of stimulated cultured lymphocytes was tagged with a monoclonal antibody to interleukin-2 receptors. The serum of patients with greater than 60% burn was significantly more suppressive (as measured by depressed tritiated thymidine incorporation by cultured lymphocytes) than that taken from patients with smaller burns. In addition, serum from those with larger burns caused a marked reduction in the interleukin-2 receptor-labeling index, suggesting that it possesses factor(s) that directly or indirectly block T lymphocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.\r"

  ".W": "Several reports, dealing with typical cardiovascular reactions immediately after injection of heparin during cardiac surgery, have been presented. A possible reason for these reactions is a short-lasting elevation of plasma histamine concentration following heparin injection. As most types of heparin contain antibacterial preservatives such as benzyl alcohol, which can cause adverse reactions, both substances, heparin itself and the preservative, can theoretically be responsible for this reaction. Therefore, this study was carried out in order to measure the effects of preservative-free heparin on plasma-histamine levels and on hemodynamic parameters. It became evident that preservative-free heparin also entails characteristical hemodynamic effects, such as a decrease in arterial mean pressure and peripheral vascular resistance as well as an increase in cardiac output. A significant increase in plasma-histamine concentration could be shown 20-120 seconds after injection of heparin. We conclude that benzyl alcohol is not the major reason for the hemodynamic effects and elevation of plasma-histamine concentration, following heparin injection, but we cannot exclude that benzyl alcohol does in fact play a minor role. The results of this study suggest that the cardiovascular reactions and the elevation of plasma histamine concentration following heparin injection are heparin-specific phenomena.\r"

After activation with anti-Ig, splenic B cells rapidly expressed IL-6 mRNA with peak expression occurring at 4 h and declining rapidly thereafter. In an attempt to exclude that the IL-6 mRNA expression was in non-B cells, T cells and monocytes were extensively depleted. In this highly purified B cell population, IL-6 mRNA was retained, whereas the expression of the T cell- and monocyte-restricted CD2 and CD14 genes was nearly undetectable. These results are consistent with the conclusion that activated B cells express IL-6 mRNA. Because we found IL-6 mRNA expression in normal activated B lymphocytes, we examined the expression of IL-6 mRNA in B cell neoplasms. 11 of 25 non-Hodgkins B cell lymphomas and 4 of 4 myelomas and plasma cell leukemias expressed IL-6 mRNA, whereas only 1 of 19 B cell leukemias was positive. To exclude that IL-6 mRNA expression in neoplastic B cells was the result of contaminating non-B cells, T cells and monocytes were extensively depleted from the tumor specimens. In the three IL-6-positive tumor samples depleted of T cells and monocytes, IL-6 mRNA expression was retained in all cases. These observations provide support for the idea that the IL-6 gene is expressed in normal activated and neoplastic B cells.\r"

In tuberculous pleuritis, mean concentrations of total 1,25-(OH)2-D were elevated in pleural fluid, compared to blood (67 pg/ml vs. 35 pg/ml). Concentrations of albumin, protein and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) were lower in pleural fluid than blood, suggesting that accumulation of binding proteins does not explain the transpleural gradient of 1,25-(OH)2-D. The mean free 1,25-(OH)2-D concentration in pleural fluid was increased 5.3-fold over that in serum. 1,25-(OH)2-D3 inhibited PPD-induced proliferation of pleural fluid mononuclear cells, antigen-reactive lines and T lymphocyte clones derived from a single cell. Patient-derived PPD-reactive lines expressed a high-affinity intracellular binding moiety for 1,25-(OH)2-D3. Pleural fluid mononuclear cells and PPD-reactive lines did not metabolize 25-OH-D3 to 1,25-(OH)2-D3. The sum of these data suggests that concentration of 1,25-(OH)2-D in pleural fluid of tuberculosis patients is probably due to local hormone production by pleural tissue-based inflammatory cells that are not present in significant numbers in pleural fluid. Elevated concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2-D in pleural fluid may exert receptor-mediated inhibition of antigen-induced proliferation by pleural fluid lymphocytes. Inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and lymphokine production may prevent tissue destruction from an uncontrolled inflammatory response.\r"

  ".W": "To improve our understanding of the metabolic role of cytokines in protein wasting, we estimated the rates of protein synthesis and degradation in muscle and liver tissues in intact rats treated with several doses of recombinant IL 1 and/or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/cachectin. Protein breakdown in muscle and liver were derived in vivo from the relationship between [14C]leucine distribution and tissue dilution in reference to circulating leucine. Synthesis was derived from the relationship between [14C]leucine appearance in the protein-bound and free-tissue leucine pools. To specifically relate changes in leucine tracer metabolism to protein dynamics, we separately measured the effect of these cytokines on blood flow to different tissues. The increase in dilution of the tissue-free [14C]leucine by TNF and TNF/IL 1 mixture, but not by IL 1 alone, could not be explained by a hemodynamic effect of these cytokines. Rather, this finding indicated that muscle proteolysis is enhanced by TNF and synergistically augmented by the addition of IL 1. Compatible with these data was the finding that more prolonged infusions of recombinant TNF/cachectin and the combination with IL 1 increased urinary nitrogen excretion. Changes in [14C]leucine dilution in the liver were less pronounced than those in skeletal muscle and consistent with net anabolic effect of TNF on liver protein. We conclude that rats exposed systemically to sublethal doses of TNF respond with increasing muscle and decreasing liver proteolysis, similar to that observed in inflammation and in cancer.\r"

In other individuals, N-glycanase-treated FcR III appeared as a single band with an Mr of either 33 or 29 kD. After SDS-PAGE of N-glycanase-treated FcR III under nonreducing conditions, the apparent Mr of each structural type was decreased, suggesting the presence of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Digestion of the 33-kD band and the 29-kD band with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease yielded similar, but not identical, peptide maps. Thus, at least two polymorphic forms of FcR III are expressed on human neutrophils. The structural polymorphism of neutrophil FcR III correlated with previously described antigenic polymorphisms detected by monoclonal antibody Gran 11 and by alloantisera which recognize epitopes of the biallelic, neutrophil antigen (NA) system. Individuals whose neutrophils expressed the two-band structural type of FcR III were NA1NA2 heterozygotes. Individuals whose neutrophils expressed the single 33-kD band structural type were NA2NA2 homozygotes, and individuals whose neutrophils expressed the single 29-kD band structural type were NA1NA1 homozygotes. These findings indicate that antigenic and structural polymorphisms of human neutrophil FcR III are related and can be accounted for by differences at the level of primary protein structure.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous investigators have suspected that there is a genetic predisposition to rheumatic fever (RF). In this context we have recently produced a series of monoclonal antibodies directed against B cells obtained from RF patients one of which, labeled D8/17, identifies a B cell antigen present in 100% of all RF patients studied. While the highest percentage of positive cells were exhibited by RF probands (33.5% +/- SE), the percentage of cells in unaffected siblings and parents was 14.6 and 13%, respectively. The percentage of positive cells in APSGN probands, unaffected siblings, and parents was 2.96, 3.86, and 2.8%, respectively. A low level of B cells (5-7%) bearing the D8/17 marker was seen in control patients. The segregation pattern of the phenotypes defined by the percentage of D8/17 positive cells within HLA-typed RF families are consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance not associated with the human MHC system. We postulate that these phenotypes indicate the presence of at least one necessary genetic factor for susceptibility to RF.\r"

Highly purified populations of CD4-, CD8-, CD3- (triple negative) thymocytes were isolated by combined panning and preparative cell sorting and the ability of triple negative thymocytes to proliferate in response to various cytokines determined. Maximal triple negative proliferation was obtained using a mitogenic combination of CD2 antibodies and either rIL-2 or the phorbol ester, PMA. Long term growth (2 to 6 wk) of postnatal triple negative thymocytes was best achieved using CD2 antibodies and rIL-2. After in vitro culture with CD2 antibodies and rIL-2, triple negative thymocytes gave rise to TCR-delta+ cells beginning on day 2 of culture (approximately 15% CD3/TCR-delta+) reaching maximum (approximately 60% CD3/TCR-delta+) on day 7 with stable number of TCR-delta+ cells observed in vitro for up to 6 wk. Analysis of 30 clones of human postnatal triple negative thymocytes demonstrated 9 of 30 (30%) were TCR-delta+, beta F1-, essentially ruling out overgrowth of the triple negative population over time by a minor pool of contaminating TCR-delta+ cells. Thus, these studies have defined an in vitro culture system for human postnatal T cell precursors and demonstrated that precursors of human TCR-gamma delta+ T cells reside in the triple negative thymocyte pool.\r"

The antiserum immunoprecipitates a 55 kDa protein, consistent with the size predicted by the cDNA sequence. Flow microfluorometric analysis of a panel of T cell tumors and clones demonstrated concordance of reactivity of intact cells with the anti-CD2 serum and the presence of CD2 mRNA. Surprisingly, although splenic T cells were found to uniformly express high levels of CD2, several of a panel of functional T cell clones were found to lack CD2 expression. This suggests that the clones lost CD2 upon in vitro cultivation, and may not be required for activation or maintenance in culture. Adult thymocytes exhibited heterogeneous expression of CD2. The majority of CD4-8- thymocytes expressed low levels and CD4+8+ thymocytes intermediate levels, whereas all CD4+8- and the majority of CD4-8+ thymocytes expressed high levels of CD2. Multiparameter analysis of CD2 expression and that of CD3, CD5, JIId, and IL-2R p55 chain showed that expression of CD2 correlates with the maturational state of thymocytes. Finally, analysis of fetal thymuses from timed pregnancies revealed that expression of CD2 is preceded by that of IL-2R p55 chain.\r"

These various functional consequences may be due to changes in the signaling properties of the receptor complex during development. In this report we show that alpha beta TCR engagement on immature thymocytes has different effects on intracellular free calcium concentrations than alpha beta TCR engagement on mature T cells. In contrast, CD3 engagement on immature thymocytes and mature T cells has the same effect on intracellular free calcium, suggesting that altered signal transduction in immature thymocytes may be due to inefficient alpha beta TCR-CD3 coupling. These studies also suggest that in certain T cell populations, activation events resulting from ligation of CD3 may not accurately reflect the activation events resulting from ligation of the physiologic receptor, alpha beta TCR.\r"

  ".U": "89215257\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously described a molecule on the SRBC surface which, in addition to the sheep equivalent of LFA-3, is involved in the process of rosette formation. It is made of a single, 14- to 19-kDa, polypeptide chain, and we termed this molecule S14. We have now identified, on the human E a molecule with a similar Mr albeit somewhat higher (19 kDa). The mAb against H19 efficiently block autologous or homologous rosettes by binding to human E. In addition, purified H19 molecules block rosettes made with human E and SRBC in a dose-dependent manner. The H19 molecule, like LFA-3, is not limited to the E surface, but is also present on many nucleated cells, including T cells and monocytes. Moreover H19, like LFA-3, is required for T cell activation: when we stimulated whole PBMC anti-H19 blocked [H3]TdR incorporation triggered via CD3, but not via CD2, in contrast to anti-LFA-3 that inhibited activation via both pathways. When a mixture of highly purified T-PBL and autologous paraformaldehyde fixed accessory cells (AC) was cultivated, anti-H19 or anti-LFA-3 mAb bound to AC blocked T cell proliferation. When high amounts of rIL-1 (100 U/ml) were added to purified T-PBL, no AC were required to sustain their proliferation upon stimulation via CD2, contrary to stimulation via CD3. When lower amounts of rIL-1 (10 U/ml) were used, fixed AC were still necessary to sustain proliferation via CD2. In this latter situation, anti-H19 mAb bound to AC could no longer inhibit T cell proliferation, whereas the anti-LFA-3 mAb was still inhibitory. When T-PBL were stimulated via CD2 in the presence of 100 U/ml of rIL-1, anti-LFA-3 did not induce any inhibition. Thus the inhibitory effect of anti-H19 and anti-LFA-3 mAb can both be accounted for by an effect on the AC molecules only, and not on the T cell molecules. F(ab')2 fragments of anti-H19 mAb produced the same pattern of inhibition as the whole Ig molecule, excluding an effect via the FcR. Moreover, purified preparations of the H19 molecules also produced inhibition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89215261\r", 
  ".W": "A number of cell surface molecules are differentially expressed on functionally distinct subsets of CD4+ T cells. However, to date CD4+ T cells capable of becoming CTL have not been shown to be phenotypically distinct from other CD4+ T cells, and in the current study we examined the ability of Leu 8+ and Leu 8- CD4+ subpopulations to become cytotoxic effectors after their stimulation with allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell lines. Although CD4+, Leu 8+ cells proliferated more vigorously than CD4+, Leu 8- cells in primary cultures stimulated with allogeneic LCL, the CD4+, Leu 8- population was the major source of cytotoxic effectors, killing targets with specificity for their class II MHC alloantigens. In most subjects, CD4+ precursors of CTL were distinguished not only by their lack of Leu 8 expression but also by their relatively high density of CD2, LFA-1, and LFA-3, molecules known to mediate non-specific cell-to-cell adhesion and postulated to be markers of immunologic memory. The absence of Leu 8 does not appear to be a reliable memory cell marker, however, because Leu 8+ as well as Leu 8-, CD4+ cells from PPD skin test positive subjects responded to the recall Ag, PPD. During 3 mo of continuous culture with allogeneic stimulators, Leu 8- cells retained their cytolytic activity and remained unreactive with anti-Leu 8 mAb, whereas Leu 8+ cells remained non-cytolytic and reactive with anti-Leu 8, suggesting that under the conditions used the Leu 8 phenotype is relatively stable. PHA or anti-CD3 mAb enhanced non-specific killing by alloantigen-stimulated CD4+,Leu 8- lines but failed to unmask any cytolytic potential in CD4+,Leu 8+ lines. We conclude that MHC class II-specific cytolytic CD4+ T cells can be distinguished from non-cytolytic CD4+ cells on the basis of their surface phenotype, and that most CD4+ CTL are contained within the Leu 8- subpopulation.\r"

The TCR delta 1+ cells comprised an average of 15% of the splenic CD3+ cells and 7% of circulating T cells. The T gamma delta cells in these human tissues, like their avian counterparts, were often not \"double-negative\" for the CD4 and CD8 accessory molecules. Approximately 50% of the splenic delta+ cells expressed CD8, and 30% of the delta+ cells in blood were CD8+. T cells of both gamma delta and alpha beta TCR isotypes were exceedingly rare in the skin. The T gamma delta cells exhibited preferential homing to the sinusoidal areas (red pulp) of the spleen and into the epithelial layer of the intestine in humans, as had been previously noted in chickens. Although 80% of the T gamma delta cells in the human intestinal mucosa were localized in the epithelial layer, these cells represented only 5 to 10% of all the CD3+ T cells in this microenvironment. We conclude that T gamma delta cells represent a sizeable subpopulation of the T cells in human peripheral tissues. The phylogenetic conservation of the CD8 expression by peripheral T gamma delta cells and of their preferential homing pattern suggests a special role in bodily defense for this T cell subpopulation.\r"

Exposure of HIV-infected target cells to the conjugate for as short a period as 1 h resulted in cell death. Serum of AIDS patients inhibited, but did not completely suppress, the toxicity of the 907-RAC conjugate. A second antibody, designated BM-1, which recognizes a carbohydrate Ag on the surface of virally infected cells, was conjugated to RAC. The BM-1-RAC conjugate did not kill HIV-infected cells, highlighting the importance of the target Ag.

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of SLE is commonly attributed to the deposition of circulating immune complexes consisting of DNA and anti-DNA autoantibodies. However, recent work has shown multiple cross-reactions between anti-DNA antibodies and a variety of cellular and extracellular Ag. To test the possibility that these antibodies interact directly with glomerular Ag and induce kidney dysfunction, we applied mouse and human anti-DNA IgG to the isolated perfused rat kidney. The NZB/NZW mouse monoclonal anti-DNA bound to glomerular Ag with a concomitant induction of proteinuria and a decrease in inulin clearance. The albumin excretion was 2301 +/- 734 micrograms/min at 160 min of perfusion, as compared with 85 +/- 21 micrograms/min in controls (p less than 0.001). The inulin clearance was reduced to 0.17 +/- 0.02 ml/min as compared with 0.28 +/- 0.09 ml/min in controls (p less than 0.05). Polyclonal anti-DNA IgG obtained from patients with lupus nephritis bound to rat glomeruli and induced albumin excretion of 542 +/- 217 micrograms/min at 160 min of perfusion, as compared with 163 +/- 77 micrograms/min in controls (p = NS). The addition of plasma as a source of C to the human IgG increased the proteinuria markedly (albumin excretion of 1115 +/- 195 micrograms/min at 160 min of perfusion, p less than 0.02), probably due to C activation. Preincubation of the reactive mouse and human IgG with DNA completely abolished their binding to renal tissue and its physiologic consequences. These results suggest that direct binding of anti-DNA antibodies to renal Ag may play an important role in the induction of lupus nephritis.\r"

The experiments show that all three pretreatments exacerbate injury in this model whether judged by albuminuria or the prevalence of glomerular capillary thrombi. The effect on albuminuria was dose dependent with all three treatments. The lowest effective dose of LPS was 0.025 microgram while those for hrTNF and hrIL-1 beta were 0.4 microgram and 0.5 microgram, respectively. All three pretreatments also increased the prevalence of glomerular capillary thrombi which were rare in rats injected with anti-GBM antibodies without pretreatment. LPS pretreatment appeared to be more effective in causing glomerular capillary thrombi than hrTNF or hrIL-1 beta and this was reflected in the correlations between albuminuria and the proportion of glomeruli with capillary thrombi. This relation was linear for all three pretreatments but the slope was appreciably greater for rats pretreated with LPS (0.37) when compared with results from rats given either hrTNF (0.22) or hrIL-1 beta (0.29). Pretreatment of nephritic rats with both cytokines increased the slope to 0.42 demonstrating a synergistic effect. The synergism of hrTNF with hrIL-1 beta was also demonstrated by the effective doses needed to induce albuminuria which was evident in rats treated with 0.05 microgram of IL-1 beta and 0.4 microgram of TNF. Neither the cytokines nor LPS caused clinical, morphologic, or biochemical evidence of renal toxicity when given alone in the dose used here but they did cause a transient increase in the number of neutrophils marginated in glomerular capillaries. Pretreatment of rats with LPS or cytokines increased the glomerular neutrophil influx after anti-GBM antibodies by roughly sixfold. Our experiments show that TNF and IL-1 can increase the severity of glomerular injury in nephritis; they may be important in modulating glomerular injury clinically.\r"

  ".W": "The magnitude of immunologic defects observed in HIV-1-infected individuals before the development of overt AIDS is disproportionately high in comparison to the levels of infectious virus in these patients--suggesting that factors other than direct virus-induced cytopathology may be involved. With this in mind, we investigated the immunologic consequences of the interaction between purified HIV-1 gp120 and the CD4 molecules expressed by uncommitted as well as Ag-specific lymphocytes. HIV-1 gp120 exhibited a dose-dependent immunosuppressive effect on: 1) Ag-driven proliferation of cloned CD4+ lymphocytes, 2) OKT3-driven proliferation of cloned CD4+ lymphocytes, and 3) cytolytic activity of CD4+, EBV-specific CTL. Thus, HIV-1 gp120 can, in a manner similar to OKT4A antibodies, suppress T cell activation and the expression of cytolytic activities through its interaction with CD4. Additionally, activated CD4+ lymphoblasts can be rendered susceptible to immune cytolysis by virtue of their binding of purified gp120. This \"targeting\" of activated lymphoblasts can occur with levels of gp120 far below that which is needed to saturate all OKT4A-defined CD4 epitopes. Adsorbed gp120 could be demonstrated on the surface of these cells for up to 12 h, a sufficient time for interaction with host cytolytic elements. The data from these in vitro modeling experiments highlight one of many potential mechanisms of HIV-1 induced immunosuppression and lymphocyte destruction that can occur in the absence of infectious virus and that is based on the unique interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and its cellular receptor, CD4.\r"

  ".W": "The capacity of human T4 cells stimulated by immobilized monoclonal antibodies to the CD3 molecular complex (64.1 and OKT3) to induce and regulate B cell responsiveness was examined. T4 cells stimulated by low concentrations of immobilized 64.1 (3.0 ng/well) and all concentrations of immobilized OKT3 supported B cell proliferation and differentiation. High concentrations of immobilized 64.1 (200 ng/well) failed to stimulate help but rather induced suppression by T4 cells. Suppression was prevented by treating the T4 cells with mitomycin C. Suppression could not be accounted for by deprivation of IL-2. In contrast, induction of suppressor T4 cell activity was closely related to the amount of IL-2 produced by anti-CD3 stimulated T4 cells. Moreover, IL 2 appeared to facilitate the generation of suppressor T4 cell activity. Suppressor cell activity could be generated from unseparated T4 cells as well as from highly purified T4 cell subsets, including Leu 8-, CD45R+, and CD45R- T4 cells, after stimulation with immobilized 64.1. A primary action of suppressor T4 cells appeared to be the direct inhibition of B cell function, as evidenced by the finding that immobilized anti-CD3 activated T4 cells directly suppressed B cell responses stimulated by Staphylococcus aureus and IL-2. Anti-CD3 activated T4 cells did not inhibit initial B cell activation, but suppressed the capacity of the activated B cells to differentiate into ISC. The suppressive influence of anti-CD3 activated T4 cells was reversible as evidenced by the finding that removal of the activated T4 cells from the culture permitted B cell differentiation to proceed. Moreover, anti-CD3-activated T4 cells were able to stimulate initial B cell activation that became apparent when the T cells and B cells were separated. Inhibition of B cell responsiveness by 64.1-activated T4 cells was the result of a block at the G1-S interphase of the cell cycle. The data indicate that anti-CD3-stimulated T4 cells directly and reversibly suppress human B cell function. Moreover, IL 2 appears to play an important role in the differentiation of functionally effective suppressor cells from activated T4 cells.\r"

The Th cell line L14 and the cytotoxic T cell line C30.1, both grown in IL-2-containing medium, and a line derived from C30.1 cells (line 1) cultured in IL-4 for a prolonged period were studied. All three cell lines could be activated with IL-2 or IL-4. T cell stimulation by either IL-2- or IL-4-induced identical patterns of cell size enlargement and transferrin receptor expression. However, only IL-2 up-regulated cell-surface expression of the p55 subunit of the IL-2R (p55 IL-2R) as measured by flow cytometry and RIA. This difference was also reflected by the accumulation of soluble p55 IL-2R in the culture medium. No significant increase in expression of membrane or soluble forms of p55 IL-2R was detected after IL-4 stimulation. mAb specific for p55 IL-2R which block IL-2-induced T cell growth did not affect IL-4-mediated T cell proliferation indicating that p55 IL-2R is not involved in IL-4-mediated T cell growth. Analysis of IL-4R expression performed on line 1 using biotinylated IL-4 revealed that IL-4, but not IL-2, is capable of increasing IL-4R expression. Together these results suggest that during IL-2- or IL-4-induced T cell proliferation, each lymphokine specifically up-regulates its own receptor.\r"

In this report, we have studied the biochemical basis for TNF-alpha activation of the IL-2R alpha (Tac, p55) gene. Transfection of human T cell lines with selectively mutated forms of the IL-2R alpha promoter revealed that a kappa B element (nucleotides -267 to -256), as well as 5' flanking sequences (nucleotides -281 to -271) are required for TNF-alpha induction of this transcriptional unit. DNA binding studies demonstrated that this IL-2R alpha kappa B control element is specifically bound by a set of TNF-alpha inducible T cell nuclear proteins of relative Mr 80 to 90, 50 to 55, and 38 to 42 kDa. This protein recognition site from the IL-2R alpha promoter, as well as related kappa B motifs from the long terminal repeat of the type I human immunodeficiency virus, proved sufficient to impart TNF-alpha inducibility to an unresponsive heterologous promoter. These findings suggest that TNF-alpha-stimulated expression of the IL-2R alpha gene involves the induction of specific DNA binding proteins that in turn interact with a kappa B-like promoter element and facilitate activation of this transcription unit.\r"

  ".U": "89215278\r", 
  ".W": "Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is a potent polyclonal T cell activator. Its activating effect is entirely dependent upon its binding to accessory cells. Monocytes, B cells, and B lymphomas can bind SEA and support activation of T cells. We have earlier found that Raji cells are particularly efficient as accessory cells for SEA-induced T cell proliferation. In the present investigation we have used this cell line for the isolation and characterization of the membrane molecule to which SEA binds. Flow cytometric analysis of cells dually stained with SEA and anti-HLA-DR mAb showed that the amount of bound SEA was proportional to the HLA-DR expression. Electrophoresis of detergent extracts of Raji cells revealed one distinct SEA-binding band with a Mr of 60 to 65 kDa. This band had the same electrophoretic mobility as the MHC class II molecules. A mAb (G8) with the ability to block SEA binding to Raji cells was established. This mAb was shown to bind to the HLA-DR molecule. Both the G8 mAb and an anti-HLA-DR mAb 9-49 inhibited SEA binding to accessory cells and also inhibited SEA-induced, but not PHA-induced, T cell proliferation and production of IL-2. Immunoprecipitation with specific anti-HLA-DR and anti-HLA-DQ mAb demonstrated that SEA binds to the HLA-DR molecule but not to the HLA-DQ molecule. Binding SEA to Raji cells followed by cross-linking and detergent solubilization of cell membranes, electrophoresis, and Western blotting resulted in two SEA-containing bands corresponding to a Mr of 90 and 105 kDa, respectively. Both these bands also contained the HLA-DR molecule and their appearance could be blocked by preincubation of the Raji cells with the G8 mAb. Collectively the results show that the HLA-DR molecule is the main functional molecule for binding of SEA to accessory cells and that this binding of SEA to HLA-DR is a necessary requirement for SEA-induced T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "5-HT is a neuromediator and a vasoactive amine released by platelets and murine mast cells at sites of inflammation. A role for 5-HT has been proposed in murine DTH and has been attributed to its 5-HT2R-dependent vasoactive properties. We have tested the hypothesis that the role of 5-HT in DTH is related to an interaction of 5-HT with DTH effector T cells. In vivo treatment of sensitized mice with the 5-HT2R antagonists methysergide or ketanserin inhibited both their capacity to elicit DTH and the ability of their lymphoid cells to transfer DTH. In vitro treatment of lymphoid cells, or of nylon wool-purified T cells from sensitized mice, with 10(-7) to 10(-9) M of the 5-HT2R antagonists methysergide, ketanserin, ritanserin, or LY 53857, followed by three washings, inhibited as strongly their ability to transfer DTH, both systemically or locally. Systemic and local co-transfer experiments of 5-HT2R antagonist-treated and untreated cells indicated that this inhibition was not related to the induction of suppression. 5-HT2R antagonist treatment was nontoxic to T cells; did not affect the in vitro response of T cells to mitogen; selectively inhibited the efferent, but not the afferent limb of DTH; and in the efferent T cell cascade, affected the late-acting (24 h) inflammatory DTH T cells, but not the early-acting, DTH-initiating T cells. 5-HT2R selectivity was suggested by the absence of effect of an alpha-adrenergic R antagonist, and by prevention of the inhibitory effect of a 5-HT2R antagonist by prior incubation with the selective 5-HT2R agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy phenyl-4-methyl)-2 aminopropane. In summary, inhibition of DTH effector T cell function appeared sufficient, independently of any vascular effect, to account for the in vivo inhibitory effect of 5-HT2R antagonists on the elicitation of DTH. Our data suggest that late-acting DTH effector T cells might express functional 5-HT2R, and that these receptors might require in vivo activation in order for the T cells to locally produce the inflammatory lymphokine-dependent aspects of DTH.\r"

The basophil secretagogues anti-IgE, and pollen allergens rye grass I and ragweed Ag E (Lol p I and Amb a I) were tested for their ability to promote basophil adherence to umbilical vein endothelial cells. Co-incubation of endothelial cells and basophils with anti-IgE resulted in time and dose-dependent increases in basophil adhesion. These effects were due to activation of the basophil, required both magnesium and calcium, occurred before or in the absence of histamine release, and were seen at concentrations of stimulus below the usual range of secretagogue activity. In contrast, anti-IgE or Ag stimulation of neutrophils, or basophils from donors non-responsive to anti-IgE or Ag with respect to histamine release, had no effect on cell adherence. mAb 60.3, recognizing the CD18 leukocyte adhesion molecule, inhibited anti-IgE-induced enhancement of basophil-endothelial cell binding. Exposure of basophils to low concentrations of Ag in vivo may selectively initiate basophil infiltration into tissue sites of allergic inflammation by enhancing their adherence to endothelium.\r"

  ".W": "Alkaline phosphatases (ALPase) (orthophosphoric-monoester phosphohydrolase, EC 3.1.3.1) are implicated in many biologic phenomena including ossification and differentiation of human neutrophils and choriocarcinoma cells. Another trait, demonstrated by microinjection into Xenopus oocytes, is their ability to block the first mitotic division. Previous work in our laboratory has established that ALPase is also present on murine B lymphocytes activated by either polyclonal mitogens or Th cells. We have now characterized the ALPase present on murine B cells as belonging to the liver-bone-kidney isoenzyme and found it to be implicated in B cell differentiation into antibody secretion. Thus, B cell proliferative responses, elicited either by high concentrations of rabbit anti-IgM antibodies or by LPS in the presence of PMA, are characterized by the lack of both antibody secretion and expression of ALPase activity. In contrast, B cells stimulated to differentiate into Ig-secreting cells by B cell differentiation factors, nearly in the absence of a proliferative response, express high levels of ALPase activity, as did those that were LPS-stimulated. These data showing the association of the ALPase expression with the process of B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells are discussed in the context of the possible role that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism may play in controlling the growth/differentiation rate in the B cell lineage.\r"

  ".W": "The in vitro production of IL-2 and IL-2R expression by lymphoid cells of inbred mice of strong (NFS), intermediate (C3H), or weak (B10.BR) in phenotype of Trichinella spiralis (TS) rejection was measured during a primary infection. Maximum production of IL-2 by spleen and mesenteric lymph node (MLN) cells occurred at 5 days postinfection. Cell depletion experiments demonstrated that Lyt-1.2+ T cells were predominantly responsible for in vitro IL-2 production. Cells from strong-responder NFS mice produced more IL-2 than cells from intermediate-responder C3H or weak-responder B10.BR mice. Similarly, after TS infection, NFS mice had significantly more IL-2R expressing MLN cells than B10.BR or C3H MLN cells. All mouse strains displayed a dose-dependent increase in in vitro IL-2 production after infection with 100 to 800 TS. This effect was most pronounced in NFS mice. Limiting dilution analysis of day 5 infected MLN cells demonstrated that the frequency of TS-reactive CD4+ cells was threefold higher in NFS mice than B10.BR and fourfold higher than in C3H mice. Finally, MLN cells taken from infected NFS mice responded to an exogenous source of IL-2, whereas MLN cells from infected C3H or B10.BR mice were unable to do so. We conclude that strong responsiveness in parasite rejection may be related to the amount of IL-2 produced as well as to the capacity of the lymphocytes of each mouse strain to respond to IL-2. Although these differences help explain the strong rejection phenotype of NFS mice, they fail to separate C3H and B10.BR mice where TS-responsive CD4+ precursors, IL-2 production, and dose responsiveness are all lower for the intermediate phenotype (worm rejection) C3H than the weak phenotype B10.BR mice.\r"

Three major subregions (DR, DQ, and DP) have been identified, each containing several genes encoding the alpha- and beta-chains of the class II heterodimers. In man B lymphocytes constitutively express class II molecules, whereas T lymphocytes express class II molecules only after Ag activation. We have analyzed isotype-specific expression of class II on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines and clones derived from one donor after stimulation with allogeneic cells, with the soluble Ag (purified protein derivative of tuberculin), and with mitogen activation by PHA. Class II mRNA transcripts were analyzed in parallel by Northern blot hybridization with DR, DQ, and DP beta-chain-specific cDNA probes. Nearly all activated T lymphocytes expressed DR molecules and variable numbers of DP+ cells were detected in each T cell line or clone, regardless of the mode of Ag activation. DQ molecules were only found on T cell lines or clones of the CD4 phenotype. In contrast two CD8+ cytotoxic T cell lines did not bind DQ-specific mAb although they did express DR and DP molecules. The presence of DR, DQ, and DP mRNA transcripts correlated with the differential patterns of surface expression, indicating that variations in class II cell surface expression among activated T cells may relate to differential gene regulation in these cells.\r"

Mutant .221 is characterized by: 1) complete absence of HLA-A,-B,-C mRNA transcripts and alpha-chains, and 2) intracellular expression of two non-A,-B,-C class I alpha-chains with an abundance less than or equal to 1% of normal HLA-A,-B,-C expression on similar cells. However, transferred HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genomic genes are expressed as cell surface Ag in amounts similar to expression of the same endogenous genes in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The amount of class I transcript produced from transferred class I genes is roughly proportional to the number of gene copies but, in every case studied, post-transcriptional processes limited cell surface Ag expressions to amounts approximately normal for the cell type. The ability of mutant .221 to express quantitatively normal amounts of transferred class I genes suggests that: 1) it can serve as a recipient for, and then express, any cloned HLA-A,-B, or -C gene that would normally be expressible in human B-lymphoblastoid cells; 2) the absence of a background of HLA-A,-B,-C Ag permits its use for studying the expression of normal non-A,-B,-C class I genes and of class I genes that have mutations; 3) mutant .221 can be used to create human cells that express on their surfaces just one defined class I Ag encoded by a transferred class I gene.\r"

CTL from DT6, DT141, DT166, DT169, and DT179 lysed fresh and cultured allogeneic melanomas, which shared the HLA-A2 Ag, but failed to lyse allogeneic melanomas, which shared B-region or C-region Ag, or shared no HLA class I Ag. CTL from DM141 lysed DM93, which shared A2 and Bw6, but failed to lyse DM105, which shared only Bw6. DM105 CTL failed to lyse allogeneic melanomas that shared HLA-A1, or that shared B or C region Ag, but they did lyse allogeneic melanoma DM49, which expressed an A region Ag that either was A10 or was serologically cross-reactive with A10. A T cell leukemia line, three EBV transformed B cell lines, and a pancreatic cancer line, all of which expressed HLA-A2, were not lysed by DM6 or DM179 CTL. Furthermore, HLA-matched nonmelanomas failed to inhibit autologous tumor lysis in cold target inhibition assays, whereas an HLA-A2+ allogeneic melanoma, DM93, inhibited autologous tumor lysis as effectively as the autologous tumor itself. HLA-A2, and possibly other HLA-A-region Ag, appear to function in HLA-restricted recognition of shared melanoma associated Ag by CTL.\r"

  ".W": "Murine tumor studies have suggested that variations in MHC class I expression may influence the behavior of tumor cells in vivo. Corresponding human tumor studies remain at the descriptive level but they show differences in MHC Ag expression between and even within tumors. Our purpose was to explore possible functional relationships between class I expression and sensitivity to different forms of cell-mediated lysis in a potentially immunogenic system: EBV-immortalized B cells. Their cytotoxic sensitivity was tested to CTL and to IFN- or IL-2-activated effector cells. The wild-type line (high class I) was sensitive to CTL with the appropriate Ag restriction, but resisted lysis by normal or IFN-activated PBL. In contrast, HLA loss variants showed a reduced sensitivity to CTL and an increased NK sensitivity. The latter could be related to the loss of class I molecules: an intermediate (haplotype loss) expressor variant was moderately NK sensitive, whereas a weak expressor line, with an additional down-regulation of the remaining haplotype, was highly sensitive. IL-2-activated PBL (\"LAK\") cells showed the same killing pattern as NK cells, although the levels of lysis were generally higher. These data support the hypothesis that the MHC class I Ag expression-dependent, CTL-mediated lysis is complemented by additional mechanisms, mediated by effectors that recognize cells with reduced MHC Ag expression that would otherwise escape CTL-mediated rejection.\r"

These lymphomas all express detectable levels of MMTV RNA, yet the majority of the tumors fail to produce MMTV particles. To determine if the ability of lymphomas to produce MMTV is a reflection of the differentiation state of the tumor, we examined eight lymphomas for expression of surface B and T cell Ag as well as for rearrangements and expression of TCR genes. All tumors could be grouped into three categories observed in vivo, including early lymphoid, nonmature intrathymic T cells, and immature intrathymic T cells. Cell lines corresponding to all three phenotypes produced MMTV particles, suggesting that production of virus is not linked to the differentiation state of lymphoid cells. These studies highlight the potential advantage of studying T cell lymphomas vs mixed primary populations or T cell hybridomas for evaluation of both phenotypic and molecular markers in clonal T cells.\r"

We evaluated the interactions of a soluble virus receptor (recombinant soluble CD4 or rsT4) and a reverse transcriptase inhibitor (azidothymidine, AZT) against HIV-1 replication in vitro. A variety of cell types was studied including peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a CD4-positive T-cell line, and a CD4-positive human monocyte cell line. The combination of rsT4 and AZT inhibited HIV-1 synergistically over a broad range of drug concentrations and multiplicities of infection in several different HIV-1 replication assays. Drug interactions were evaluated by the median-effect principle and the isobologram technique using a computer analysis. In all of the cell types tested, combinations of rsT4 and AZT were synergistic in vitro, without additive cytotoxicity.\r"

Children were 2-6 y of age. Thirty-three (38%) had been vaccinated. There was no significant difference between the frequency of low serum concentrations of IgM, IgA, IgG, or IgG2 in the vaccinated and nonvaccinated subjects (13% vs. 8%, P = .5). The presence of the Gm immunoglobulin allotype phenotype (1,3,17;23;5,13,21), previously associated with a lower relative risk of vaccine failure in children from other states, was associated with a fourfold decrease in the relative risk of vaccine failure in Minnesota (P less than .07). Haemophilus isolates from 58 of the children were available for clonal characterization by multilocus electrophoresis and outer membrane protein subtyping. There were no significant differences between the clone distribution of the strains causing disease in vaccinated and nonvaccinated patients, and nearly all disease-producing clones in Minnesota also are known to cause disease in other areas of the country. Thus, vaccine failure in Minnesota is infrequently associated with hypogammaglobulinemia or with infection by unusual clones of a H. influenzae type b. Also, the Gm phenotype associated with protection against vaccine failure in other areas of the USA appears to be protective in Minnesota.\r"

To evaluate the inflammatory ability of Hib LOS in its native state as part of outer membrane of Hib, the CSF inflammatory response to Hib outer membrane vesicles (OMV) was compared with that produced by Hib LOS. A significant dose-dependent meningeal inflammatory response, as evidence by increased concentrations of white blood cells and protein and lactate concentration in CSF, was found after intracisternal injection of Hib OMV containing 0.02-200 ng of LOS. On a LOS weight basis, purified LOS and LOS in OMV did not differ significantly with regard to the CSF inflammatory response. Preincubation of Hib OMV with monoclonal antibodies directed against cell surface-exposed epitopes on Hib LOS did not affect the inflammatory ability of OMV, whereas preincubation of OMV with polymyxin B significantly reduced both pleocytosis and lactate concentration. Thus, Hib OMV represents a relevant nonreplicating vehicle in which Hib LOS might interact with CNS tissues to produce meningitis.\r"

At 48 h, quantitative CSF culture results and CSF white blood cell counts were equivalent for the two groups. Organisms within the cochlea were detected in four of eight animals in each group. There was no difference between the deaf and nondeaf isolates in the degree or frequency of inner ear inflammation in formalin-fixed sections. In separate experiments, animals were inoculated with H. influenzae type b and 24 h later treated with ampicillin, or ampicillin plus dexamethasone. At 48 h, although CSF white blood cell counts were significantly reduced in the steroid group, no difference was noted in the degree of cochlear inflammation between the two groups. The ability of H. influenzae type b to invade the inner ear of infant rats does not correlate with the development of sensorineural deafness in children following H. influenzae type b meningitis. Steroid administration does not appear to diminish the inflammatory reaction within the cochlea more than antibiotics alone in this model, but may delay CSF sterilization by ampicillin.\r"

The composite for cocaine-related deaths was a 30-year-old black man in whom was also found at least 1 other drug, usually ethanol or morphine. The composite for methamphetamine-related deaths was a 32-year-old Caucasian man who used methamphetamine with at least 1 other drug (usually ethanol). For cases involving both cocaine and methamphetamine, the composite was a 36-year-old Caucasian man in whom was also found at least 1 other drug, usually ethanol, codeine, or morphine. Mean tissue concentrations of cocaine and benzoylecgonine were significantly higher in accidental overdoses than in homicides except for cocaine concentrations in liver, which did not differ significantly between the two groups. For methamphetamine-related deaths there was no significant difference between mean tissue concentrations in accidental overdoses and in homicides. Cocaine or methamphetamine or both were involved in approximately one third of homicides in San Diego County in 1987, and when fatal accidental overdoses were included, cocaine was involved in twice as many cases as methamphetamine.\r"

As part of a community-based survey of 529 homeless adults, we developed and tested a model to increase our understanding of the factors related to their psychological distress. Using a previously validated and reliable scale of perceived psychological distress, we found that homeless adults were more likely to report psychological distress than the general population (80% vs. 49%). Distress levels were not associated with most demographic or homeless characteristics or general appearance. However, distress was related to unemployment, greater cigarette and alcohol use, worse physical health, fewer social supports, and perceived barriers to obtaining needed medical care. Since mental, physical, and social health are strongly related among homeless adults, alleviating distress among them may be most effectively done by implementing a broad-based health services package coupled with employment programs provided in an accessible service delivery setting.\r"

Firstly, multiple sclerosis mortality data for the decade 1971-80 in the States of Australia confirmed the relationship between increasing disease frequency and increasing south latitude shown by State and regional point prevalence surveys based on the national census day 30 June 1981. Secondly, a comparison with mortality data from the decade 1950-59 showed that in most States there had been a substantial fall in multiple sclerosis mortality in the more recent decade and this was clearly an important contributing factor to the rise in prevalence noted between the morbidity surveys of 1961 and 1981. Thirdly, multiple sclerosis mortality in the UK-born migrant population dying in Australia was found to be similar to that of the Australian-born population and very much lower than that found in the UK. This observation corroborated evidence from the 1981 morbidity surveys and suggested that migration from the UK to Australia may lower the risk of developing multiple sclerosis either through a reduction in disease incidence or the operation of environmental factors curbing disease expression.\r"

Correlations between test results and indices of regional HMPAO distribution were analysed by multidimensional scaling (MDS). Test results covaried positively with relative HMPAO uptake of frontal, inferior parietal and superior temporal regions but not, or in a negative way, with the remainder of the regions. When only positive correlations were analysed, MDS suggested two dimensions of organization: one was related to a dichotomy between frontal and temporo-parietal regions. The relationship of test results to this dimension was largely consistent with common neuropsychological knowledge. A second, less stringent dimension of organization opposed right and left hemisphere regions. The ordering of test results with respect to this dimension was only partly consistent with what is known about the lateralization of neuropsychological deficits from the study of localized brain lesions. The possibility is considered that these inconsistencies may reflect the effect of disproportionally severe involvement of extended cortical systems which modulates the sequels of localized brain damage.\r"

  ".U": "89215956\r", 
  ".W": "In patients with large-cell lymphoma (LCL) treated with combination chemotherapy, the presence of bulk disease has consistently been associated with a poorer response rate and a shortened survival. The optimal therapy for patients with bulk disease (greater than or equal to 10 cm) will depend on whether treatment failures result from inadequate tumor eradication in prior bulk sites or from distant dissemination. To address this issue, we have evaluated patterns of relapse in patients with bulk disease who relapsed after achieving a complete remission with methotrexate, bleomycin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone (M- or m-BACOD). Eighty-one II, III, or IV patients with disease greater than or equal to 10 cm were identified; 45 of the 81 patients achieved a confirmed complete response (CR) and are included in the analysis. The 45 complete responders included 21 patients with localized (stage II) disease and 24 patients with advanced (stage III/IV) disease. Six of the 21 stage II complete responders and three of the 24 stage II/IV complete responders also received adjuvant radiation therapy following completion of M- or m-BACOD. Only one of the 21 patients with stage II disease relapsed, doing so in the site of prior bulk involvement. In contrast, nine of 24 patients with stage III/IV disease relapsed, although no patient failed solely in the site of prior bulk disease. Stage III/IV patients recurred in either a new site (one patient), a new and old site (five), an old non-bulk site (two), or both old non-bulk and bulk sites (one). These results indicate that advanced-stage bulk-disease patients do not consistently relapse in sites of prior bulk disease; therefore, this group of patients is unlikely to benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy administered following completion of combination chemotherapy. Although the low relapse rate and the addition of adjuvant radiation therapy in a subgroup of the stage II bulk-disease patients precludes a definitive analysis, our results further suggest that these patients may be effectively treated with combination chemotherapy alone.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this investigation was to determine the effect of nephrotic syndrome (NS) on the pharmacodynamics of a barbiturate. NS was induced in male rats by puromycin aminonucleoside; it caused hypoproteinemia, increased liver and kidney weight and elevated serum creatinine and urea nitrogen concentrations. Serum albumin concentration decreased from 3.5% in controls to 0.90% in NS animals. The rats were infused i.v. with heptabarbital, 1 mg/min, until they lost their righting reflex. The total dose (mean +/- S.D.) required by rats with NS, 40.2 +/- 4.2 mg/kg, was substantially lower than that required by normal animals (68.6 +/- 6.2 mg/kg, P less than .001). Serum protein binding of heptabarbital was reduced from 49% in controls to 26% in NS rats. However, the drug concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the pharmacologic endpoint was not significantly different in controls and NS rats (18.9 +/- 1.5 vs. 18.3 +/- 1.4 mg/l). Serum, CSF and the brain contained appreciable concentrations of a metabolite of heptabarbital. To determine if the metabolite contributes to the pharmacologic effect of the parent drug, rats received an i.v. injection of 46, 60 or 100 mg/kg of heptabarbital. Concentrations of heptabarbital in CSF at return of righting reflex (which occurred after 15, 25 and 50 min, respectively) were independent of dose whereas metabolite concentrations increased with increasing dose. Thus, the metabolite of heptabarbital in male rats is pharmacologically inactive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of pure philanthotoxin (PhTX), a component of the venom of the wasp Philanthus triangulum, were studied on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of vertebrates and insects so as to compare their sensitivities and the mechanism of action of PhTX. Electrophysiological techniques were used on frog muscles and cockroach thoracic ganglia and biochemical techniques were applied to membranes from Torpedo electric organ and honeybee brain. PhTX (1-20 microM) inhibited reversibly the indirectly elicited muscle twitch and reduced the endplate current peak amplitude and its decay time constant in a concentration-dependent manner. In patch clamp studies, PhTX (1-5 microM) when combined with acetylcholine, induced a concentration-dependent decrease in frequency of channel openings and in channel open and burst times. The cockroach fast coxal depressor neuron was inhibited by PhTX in a time- and voltage-dependent manner. The initial rate of binding of [3H]perhydrohistrionicotoxin to Torpedo nAChR in the presence of carbamylcholine was inhibited competitively by PhTX. Binding of alpha-[125I] bungarotoxin to electric organ and honeybee brain membranes was inhibited by PhTX. Binding of [3H]acetylcholine to the electric organ receptor was potentiated by low concentrations of PhTX but inhibited by high concentrations. PhTX, therefore, inhibits both vertebrate and insect nAChRs, which may be important molecular targets for its toxicity. It is suggested that PhTX at high concentration may have some competitive action on nAChR, but it acts mainly as a blocker of the ion channel of the nAChR in its open conformation.\r"

  ".W": "The anatomical distribution of omega 3 (peripheral type benzodiazepine binding) sites in the immune system organs of the rat has been studied autoradiographically at both macroscopic and microscopic levels of resolution using either reversible or irreversible (UV irradiation) labeling with [3H]PK 14105. In thymus sections, [3H]PK 14105 labeled with high affinity (Kd, derived from saturation experiments = 10.8 nM) a single population of sites which possessed the pharmacological characteristics of omega 3 sites. In the thymus gland, higher omega 3 site densities were detected in the cortex than in the medulla; in these subregions, silver grains were associated to small (10-18 microns diameter) cells. In the spleen, omega 3 sites were more abundant in the white than in the red pulp. In the white pulp, silver grains were denser in the marginal zone than in the vicinity of the central artery and labeling was, as in the thymus, associated to small cytoplasm-poor cells. In the red pulp, omega 3 site associated silver grains were observed mainly in the Bilroth cords. In the lymph nodes, the medullary region showed a higher labeling than the surrounding follicles and paracortex. A significant accumulation of silver grains was observed in the lymph node medullary cords. In the intestine, Peyer patches were particularly enriched in omega 3 sites (especially in the periphery of the follicles). The distribution of omega 3 sites in the immune system organs suggests a preferential labeling of cells of T and monocytic lineages. This is consistent with the proposed immunoregulatory properties of some omega 3 site ligands.\r"

They then received a slow i.v. infusion of phenobarbital or ethanol until they lost their righting reflex, or of pentylenetetrazol until the onset of maximal seizures. Drug concentrations in serum, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined at these pharmacologic endpoints. Hyperthyroidism was associated with a statistically significant increase in the infused hypnotic dose and brain concentration of phenobarbital but had no apparent effect on concentrations of the drug in serum and CSF. The hypnotic dose of ethanol was increased significantly in hyperthyroid rats and decreased in hypothyroid animals; ethanol concentrations in serum, brain and CSF at onset of effect were generally not affected by thyroid dysfunction except for a small but statistically significant increase of serum ethanol concentrations in the hyperthyroid rats. The convulsant dose of pentylenetetrazol was reduced significantly in hypothyroid animals and unaltered in hyperthyroid rats; the concentrations of the convulsant in serum, brain and CSF were not apparently changed by the thyroid dysfunctions. In general, experimental thyroid disorders had no pronounced effect on the pharmacodynamics (concentration-effect relationship) of phenobarbital, ethanol and pentylenetetrazol in rats.\r"

Furthermore, this polysaccharide induced macrophages to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interferon-beta 2. Arabinogalactan did not activate B cells and did not induce T cells to produce interleukin-2, interferon-beta 2, or interferon-gamma, but it did induce a slight increase in T-cell proliferation. When injected ip, this agent stimulated macrophages, a finding that may have therapeutic implications in the defense against tumors and infectious diseases.\r"

When primary tumors were ablated, and the treatment was given from the time of graft until ablation (seeding step), no effect on metastatic spread was noticed.

All 38 cancers were completely localized to the prostate and exact anatomical sites of origin for each of the cancers within the prostate were mapped. Whereas anatomical distribution of the cancers in the anteroposterior dimension was roughly uniform, a distinct predominance of apical prostatic cancers was observed.

Cell counts and morphometric analyses were done immediately after 60 minutes of electronically controlled seeding of 3 x 10(4) EC/cm2, as well as after 3 hours of subsequent incubation. Cell adherence and cell spreading were distinctly superior on two surface-covering substrates: fibronectin-treated type I/III collagen and fibrinolytically inhibited fibrin glue. Uncovered, purely fibronectin- or laminin-coated PTFE or type IV collagen treated with the specifically binding glycoprotein laminin showed a far lower EC attachment rate and less pronounced cell spreading. It appears that not only a high surface content of fibronectin but also a smooth PTFE-covering matrix are prerequisites for optimal primary adherence and cell spreading. Because fibrin glue might be fibrinolytically degraded despite its plasmin-inhibiting epsilon-amino-caproic acid compound, type I/III collagen plus fibronectin could provide an optimal precoating substrate for EC lining of PTFE grafts.\r"

The animals were fed diets identical except for the lipid source for periods of 5 and 6 wk. In vitro thromboxane B2/B3 (TxB2/B3) production in collagen-stimulated whole blood was also measured. One diet was enriched with menhaden oil, high in the omega-3 series of fatty acids. The other diet contained safflower oil, consisting primarily of the omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid (74%). Animals fed the fish oil-enriched diet for 6 wk not 5 week had a blunted fever response after rIL-1 injection. This was associated with a 27% increase (p less than 0.05) in total omega-3 fatty acids in plasma phospholipids between weeks 5 and 6 in fish oil-fed animals. Safflower oil-fed animals produced a \"normal\" febrile response regardless of the duration of feeding. Safflower-fed guinea pigs demonstrated a significant increase in TxB2/B3 production in whole blood after 6 wks that was associated with a 25% increase (p less than 0.05) in plasma phospholipid arachidonic acid levels between weeks 5 and 6. Despite significant reductions in phospholipid linoleic acid in animals fed fish oil, arachidonic acid levels remained unchanged. In the guinea pig model used, long-term menhaden oil feeding can significantly blunt the febrile response induced by exogenous Interleukin-1. Also, a high intake of linoleic acid as seen in safflower oil feeding can significantly increase thromboxane production in stimulated whole blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We found that diabetic animals on a 20% or 50% protein diet ate approximately 50% more protein and excreted about 50% more urinary urea nitrogen than did their respective similarly-fed nondiabetic controls. The 50% protein diet was associated with higher glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and renal blood flows (RBF) at two months in both diabetic and control animals compared to their respective controls on the lower protein diet. However, GFR and RBF were not significantly higher in the diabetic animals on the 50% protein diet in the controls on the 20% diet and were slightly, albeit not significantly lower than controls on the 50% diet. Glomerular capillary pressure (PGC) tended to be lower in the diabetic compared to their respective controls, while the high protein diet was associated with higher PGC in diabetic and nondiabetic animals. The PGC in the 50% diabetic rats was not different from the PGC in the nondiabetic rats. Urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate was greater in the diabetic than in the nondiabetic animals. UAE was greatest in the high protein diabetic animals at six months. Glomerular basement membrane thickness after six months of diabetes was increased essentially equally in both normal and high-protein fed diabetic groups and was largely uninfluenced by diet in the controls. Fractional mesangial volume was increased and relative filtration surface was decreased only in the 50%-protein diet diabetic rats at six months. Thus, high protein diet was associated with increased fractional mesangial volume in diabetic rats, but this could not be explained by increased glomerular capillary flows or pressures. The mechanism of acceleration of mesangial expansion by high protein diet in diabetic animals was not elucidated by these studies.\r"

When cellulose acetate membranes are employed, complement activation is attenuated. The molecular basis for this improved biocompatibility is unknown. It has been postulated, however, that the complement activating potential of dialysis membranes is influenced by the availability of free hydroxyl groups which would provide an acceptor site for activated C3. To investigate this hypothesis, the forms of C3 associated with cellulose acetate and cuprophan membranes have been analyzed. By Western blot, the predominant form of C3 present on both types of membranes is C3c, a degradation product of C3 that lacks the thiolester necessary for covalent bonding. Minimal amounts of C3d (the region of C3 which contains the thiolester) were observed on both membranes; however, by ELISA, there was no difference in the amount bound to cellulose acetate compared to cuprophan. Further, membrane-associated C3d could be removed by urea, suggesting that it was not bound covalently. These studies indicate that the complement activating potential of dialysis membranes is not determined primarily by the availability of potential covalent binding sites for activated C3b.\r"

The incidence rate of heavy proteinuria was determined in Pima Indians participating in a longitudinal population study of diabetes and its complications. Heavy proteinuria was defined by a urine protein (g/liter) to urine creatinine (g/liter) ratio greater than or equal to 1.0 (greater than or equal to 113 mg protein/nmol creatinine), a level which corresponds to a urine protein excretion rate of about 1 g/day. The incidence rates of proteinuria in diabetic Pimas were 4, 12, 37, and 106 cases/1,000 person-years at risk in the periods 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, and 15 to 20 years after the diagnosis of diabetes. The cumulative incidence rates were 2%, 8%, 23%, and 50% at 5, 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively. The duration of diabetes, severity of diabetes as determined by the degree of hyperglycemia and type of treatment, and blood pressure were risk factors for proteinuria. The presence of heavy proteinuria was strongly associated with the development of renal insufficiency, defined by serum creatinine greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/dl (greater than or equal to 177 mumol/liter). The incidence of proteinuria in type 2 diabetes in Pima Indians was as high as that reported in type 1 diabetes in other populations and represents a frequent, serious complication of the disease.\r"

One serum (stored for 12 years) contained, in addition, spClq-binding material sedimenting at more than 19S. Isolated MPGN IgG was shown to bind to spClq. SpClq-binding material could be totally removed from MPGN serum by absorption with BSA-anti-BSA immune precipitates, and by acid elution of the precipitates IgG binding to spClq could be recovered. F(ab')2, isolated from pepsin digested MPGN IgG, continued to bind spClq. Binding of MPGN IgG or F(ab')2 to spClq was not inhibited by 2 M NaCl. Incubation of MPGN serum with 125I Clq followed by sucrose density ultracentrifugation resulted in a peak of radioactivity at 11S, the sedimentation rate of Clq, giving evidence that material binding fluid phase Clq is not present. SpClq-binding IgG was detected in 54% of 68 MPGN patients. These results indicate that the 7S spClq-binding IgG represents antibody to a cryptic antigen revealed only when Clq fixes to a solid surface.\r"

Moreover, the distribution of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression was studied in the purified T cell population versus the non-T cell population of IgAN patients. The results show a spontaneous significant production of IL-2 in cultures of PBMC from patients with IgAN (P less than 0.025) that increased after PHA stimulation. IgAN patients also had a significantly higher expression of IL-2R on the surface of PBMC than did patients with chronic glomerulonephritis (P less than 0.05). IL-2R was usually detected on unstimulated purified T cells that expressed the activation DR antigen. Moreover, a high number of DR helper T cells was associated to a reduced number of suppressor T cells (OKT8+M1+). These findings suggest that the increased production of IL-2 in patients with IgAN may be responsible for the increased activity of helper T cells. The high number of IL-2R expressed by freshly separated PBMC implies an in vivo continuous stimulation of these cells, and this finding is in agreement with the demonstrated spontaneous hyperproduction of IL-2. Moreover, the low number of suppressor T cells may contribute to the overactivity of helper T cells bearing IL-2R in IgAN patients.\r"

Aortic crossclamp time was 60.3 +/- 12.1 minutes in group I and 52.8 +/- 7.3 minutes in group II (p = 0.12); cardiopulmonary bypass time was 103.7 +/- 11.1 minutes in group I versus 87.7 +/- 12.7 minutes in group II (p less than 0.01). One minute after the cardioplegic solution was initially given, temperatures between groups at each site were not statistically different, but left ventricular epicardial temperatures within both groups were significantly higher than in the other four sites. Nineteen minutes after administration of the cardioplegic solution, temperatures in group I at all sites were higher than in group II. Similarly, throughout the entire period of aortic crossclamping, mean temperatures (except left ventricular myocardial site), maximum temperatures, and percentage of time all temperatures were 15 degrees C or higher were greater in group I than in group II. The following conclusions can be reached: 1. Initial myocardial cooling with 1000 ml of cardioplegic solution is not significantly limited by coronary artery disease but is suboptimal (16 degrees or 17 degrees C) in the inferior left ventricular epicardium because of continual warming from the aorta and subdiaphragmatic viscera. 2. Without myocardial surface cooling, excessive external myocardial rewarming to 18 degrees to 22 degrees C occurs within 20 minutes at all sites after delivery of the cardioplegic solution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

This difference was significant. The HLA-DR4 antigen, known to be in linkage disequilibrium with the C4B null allele, was also significantly more frequent in the patients (14 of 21 patients compared with 31 of 81 normal subjects).

They were classified into three groups according to the syncytium-inducing capacity, replication rate, and host range of their HIV isolates. The most rapid progression to AIDS (median 15 months) and the lowest survival rate following AIDS diagnosis (median survival 12.5 months) were observed in individuals with high-replicating, syncytium-inducing HIV isolates, followed by individuals with high-replicating, non-syncytium-inducing isolates. In contrast, most individuals with low-replicating, non-syncytium-inducing HIV isolates remained symptom-free during the study period (median follow-up until AIDS diagnosis greater than 42 months), and the few individuals from this group in whom AIDS developed were still alive at the end of the study period (median survival greater than 34 months). In addition, AIDS patients from the three groups differed with respect to their symptoms. Zidovudine treatment in the symptom-free period seemed to delay the onset of AIDS in all risk groups, although stabilisation of CD4+ cell numbers was observed only in individuals with non-syncytium-inducing HIV variants.\r"

Other investigators have failed to confirm these findings; however, their studies did not precisely replicate Torok's test procedure. Following Torok's procedure exactly, the monothermal caloric test was administered to normal individuals and to patients with well-documented vestibular lesions. Nine of ten normal persons showed normal responses and one person showed borderline decruitment. Six of eight patients who had lesions of the vestibular nerve or central vestibular pathways showed decruitment. Two patients with active Meniere's disease showed recruitment and one showed asymmetry. Two patients with Meniere's disease who had undergone endolymphatic sac operations showed normal responses. These findings support Torok's claim that the monothermal caloric test discriminates between labyrinthine and retrolabyrinthine vestibular pathology.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic beryllium disease is characterized by the accumulation of helper/inducer T cells, macrophages, and granulomas in the lungs. To evaluate the hypothesis that the proliferation of CD4+ (helper/inducer) T cells in the lungs of patients with this disorder is maintained by local activation of beryllium-specific T-cell clones, we studied T cells obtained from peripheral blood and by bronchoalveolar lavage in eight patients and five healthy controls. The proliferation of T cells in response to beryllium in vitro was confined to the CD4+ T cells from the patients and was dependent on the presentation of antigen in the presence of both major histocompatibility complex class II antigens and functional interleukin-2 receptors. T cells from the patients' lungs had a significantly greater response to beryllium than did T cells from their peripheral blood (stimulation index, 103 vs. 5; P less than 0.01). Lines and clones of cells developed from T cells from the patients' lungs showed dose-dependent proliferation in response to beryllium but did not respond to recall antigens or to other metals. Although all beryllium-specific T-cell clones were CD4+ and none were CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic), all beryllium-specific clones studied had different rearrangements of T-cell antigen receptors, suggesting that the response to beryllium involved T cells with diverse specificities for beryllium. We conclude that in patients with chronic beryllium disease, beryllium acts as a class II-restricted antigen, stimulating local proliferation and accumulation in the lung of beryllium-specific CD4+ (helper/inducer) T cells. Hence, chronic beryllium disease is a hypersensitivity disease in which beryllium is the specific antigen.\r"

We report a child with progressive basal ganglia and other subcortical calcifications prior to the use of folinic acid. Six other reported cases of DHPR deficiency demonstrated similar calcifications prior to folinic acid therapy. Since this pattern of calcification also resembles that seen in CNS folate deficiency caused by both congenital folate deficiency and that which is methotrexate-induced, we propose that intracranial calcification in DHPR deficiency is caused by inadequate CNS tetrahydrofolate and may be prevented by the use of folinic acid. Our patient achieved excellent seizure control following the use of folinic acid, suggesting either a direct or indirect anticonvulsant effect of this compound in patients with DHPR deficiency.\r"

The average age was 85.4 years (range, 60-108 years). With aphakia and pseudophakia included in the diagnosis of \"cataract,\" the respective prevalences were found to be 81, 37, 11, and 2.1%. There was a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of cataracts and AMD in those patients 85 years of age or older when compared with the younger patients in the nursing home (P less than 0.05). Of those patients without organic brain syndrome, 44% (66/151) had a visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye. Thirty percent (45/151) had a visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in both eyes. Although this study has no control population of patients outside nursing homes, a review of the literature suggests that geriatric nursing home patients may have a higher prevalence of eye disease than their chronologic peers outside nursing homes. Further study is necessary to determine whether residents of geriatric nursing homes are receiving adequate ophthalmic care.\r"

The temporal course, character and extent of these phenomena, however, have not yet been elucidated. In a prospective study, we investigated the incidence, clinical picture and the temporal course of PBS. One hundred and twenty women who, during a 1 year period, embarked consecutively on post-operative control or treatment at the department, were interviewed by a standard questionnaire 3 weeks after the operation. One year later 110 patients were interviewed again. The median age at the first interview was 54 years (Q1 = 45 years; Q3 = 62 years). The incidence of PBS was 25.8% at the first interview and 24.5% at the second. The incidence of phantom pain and non-painful phantom sensations was 13.3% and 15.0%, respectively, 3 weeks after mastectomy and 12.7% and 11.8%, respectively after 1 year. We found significant relationships between pre-operative pain and PBS, but no significant relation between age and the occurrence of PBS. Neither post-operative sequelae nor cancer treatment including radiotherapy seemed to affect the occurrence of PBS. Exteroceptive-like pain emerged as the most predominant type of pain from both interviews. At the time of the first interview, 35.0% of the patients experienced cicatrix pain which was clearly distinguishable from phantom pain; after 1 year, 22.7% of the patients had persistent cicatrix pain. The present incidence of PBS is close to the incidence reported by others. Persistent phantom pain may, however, be more common than usually expected. Also persistence of cicatrix pain seems to be more common than generally expected.\r"

The subject received TENS or placebo stimulation on separate sessions in which baseline periods of no stimulation alternated with periods of TENS (or placebo). Throughout the two sessions, continuous measures of stump skin conductance, surface skin temperature and phantom intensity were obtained. The results showed that TENS applied to the contralateral leg was significantly more effective than a placebo in decreasing the intensity of phantom sensations, whereas stimulation of the outer ears led to a non-significant increase. The pattern of electrodermal activity on the TENS session was consistently linear during baseline periods, indicating a progressive increase in sympathetic sudomotor activity. In contrast, during periods of electrical stimulation the pattern of electrodermal activity was consistently curvilinear indicating an initial decrease followed by an increase in sudomotor responses. Changes in stump skin conductance correlated significantly with changes in phantom sensations both in TENS and placebo sessions suggesting a relationship between sympathetic activity at the stump and paresthesias referred to the phantom. Two hypotheses are presented to account for these findings.\r"

Bacterial pneumonia, defined on the basis of positive cultures of blood or pleural fluid, was diagnosed in 4 children (7%), 1 of whom also had viral pneumonia. Viral pneumonia, defined as a positive nasopharyngeal sample or positive serology, was diagnosed in 20 children (35%). Serum and concentrated urine were tested by latex agglutination (Wellcogen) for Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal antigens and by countercurrent immunoelectrophoresis for pneumococcal antigens. Pneumococcal antigen could not be detected in serum or urine from 3 children with culture-proved pneumococcal pneumonia, indicating poor sensitivity of the tests. In contrast apparent H. influenzae type b antigenuria was detected by latex agglutination in 4 of 40 children with pneumonia but also in 5 of 57 controls, and a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for polyribosyl ribitol (PRP) phosphate antigen showed that all 9 cases were false positives. The specificity of H. influenzae type b antigen detection was thus poor. Children with viral and bacterial pneumonia could not be distinguished by radiographic or clinical criteria (symptoms, fever) or by total or differential white blood cell counts, serum C-reactive protein or nasal or serum interferon levels. It is not possible to distinguish reliably childhood viral from bacterial pneumonia clinically or by rapid diagnostic tests.\r"

In 5 of these children the concentration of H. influenzae type b in nasal mucus was 10(4) to 10(7) colony-forming units/ml3. H. influenzae type b in nasal mucus applied to fomites were recovered for 12 hours. Cultures of saliva and cough secretions compared with nasal mucus were less often positive (3 of 31, P less than 0.001; 3 of 25, P less than 0.001, respectively) and contained fewer H. influenzae type b (5 and 15 colony-forming units, respectively). H. influenzae type b was recovered from the hand of 2 of 27 (7%) children; both children had positive cultures of saliva. These data indicate that H. influenzae type b can be found in oral and respiratory secretions of pharyngeal carriers and can contaminate children's hands. Nasal mucus was the most consistently positive secretion and contained the largest number of bacteria. Careful management of nasal mucus secretions is warranted in settings where transmission could occur to susceptible children.\r"

A descriptive study was undertaken to review retrospectively the 1077 pediatric coroner's cases in 11 California counties for differences between urban and rural violent death rates. Pediatric violent death was more prevalent in the urban region than in the rural region (P less than 0.0007). High urban homicide rates accounted for most of this difference. Suicide rates were not significantly different (P = 0.18). Seventy-four percent of the violent deaths were in the 15- to 18-year age group, and most of these deaths were caused by firearms (81%). Blacks had the highest homicide and suicide rates. Child abuse was an important cause of death for young children in the urban area only. Socioeconomic factors, cultural differences, high population density, and the availability of firearms were proposed as factors affecting violent death in the pediatric age group.\r"

  ".W": "Multichannel electrical stimulation was applied in 20 patients with hemiplegia secondary to stroke or head injury using a six-channel microprocessor stimulator-stride analyzer to restore independent gait and to reestablish a normal gait pattern in a two- to three-week therapy period. The therapy was followed up at every session by a stride analyzer incorporated into the stimulator. At the beginning and at the end of the therapy period, each subject's gait was measured with a ground reaction measuring system. Statistical results and observations are presented for the group of 20 subjects, and a detailed description of the results is given for one subject who is representative of the whole group. According to the measured gait characteristics, gait improved significantly in all subjects during the therapy period, resulting in a partly or completely independent gait. The subjects' posture and endurance also improved, and they spontaneously learned how to use a crutch. The measurements and visual assessment of the subjects' progress indicate that the described treatment protocol offers good prospects for faster and more efficient gait rehabilitation in severely impaired patients. To determine the efficacy of gait therapy with multichannel electrical stimulation, a comparative study of conventional therapeutic methods and the method described in this article should be conducted.\r"

In the present report, results from experimental tuberculosis studies in mice are summarized which indicate that both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are generated during tuberculosis. Furthermore, evidence is presented that both T cell populations are involved in protection against and pathogenesis of tuberculosis and that the final outcome of the host response depends on an intricate balance between these two types of T cells.\r"

The mean CH50 of maternal sera exceeded the mean CH50 of both amniotic fluids and cord sera. The mean CH50 of amniotic fluids exceeded that of cord sera and increased significantly at 32 weeks. This rise preceded that of the mean CH50 of cord sera, which occurred at a fetal weight of approximately 2,500 grams. The mean CH50 of amniotic fluids varied significantly and inversely with that of cord sera. The levels of CH50 in these three fluids did not distinguish between patients with preterm uterine contractions who delivered prematurely and those who delivered at term. The CH50 in patients with premature rupture of membranes did not differ from a control population of women with uncomplicated pregnancies. The mean CH50 of maternal sera was increased in patients with chorioamnionitis but was not predictive of chorioamnionitis. The mean CH50 of maternal sera was decreased in patients who smoked cigarettes and in patients who received intravenous ritodrine.\r"

Rates for white men decreased 32% (p = 0.001), whereas in other race-sex groups changes were not significant, although there was a downward trend (p = 0.18) among black men. Among white men decreases in the AMI rates occurred in each of the decades of age 35 to 64 years. In all race-sex groups there was a sharp increase in rates between 1978 and 1985 for those 65 to 74 years of age, suggesting that the incidence of AMI was delayed to a later age. Out-of-hospital AMI death rates declined markedly in all race-sex groups: 63% for white men, 62% for white women, 49% for black men, and 39% for black women. Overall case fatality rates declined from 14% (27 of 193) to 10% (23 of 232), but the decrease was not statistically significant.\r"

Maximal exercise heart rate and blood pressure were reduced and exercise time was increased with beta blockers. Estimated stress defect size decreased from 47 +/- 36.3 gm during placebo treatment to 32 +/- 27.1 gm during beta blocker therapy (-32%; p less than 0.01). The placebo treatment redistribution defect was estimated to be 28 +/- 29.8 gm. It fell to 15 +/- 23.3 gm with beta blockade (-46%; p less than 0.005). All patients had a stress Tl-201 defect during placebo treatment and eight had redistribution defects consistent with residual scar. During beta blocker therapy, 2 of 12 patients had normal stress-redistribution studies and only five patients had redistribution defects. Beta blockade can reduce exercise and redistribution Tl-201 SPECT defect size significantly while simultaneously increasing exercise time and reducing angina. Beta blockers may unmask or may eliminate evidence of redistribution. Tl-201 SPECT imaging may be useful in defining the reduction in ischemia produced by cardiac drugs.\r"

The study population consisted of 506 patients with stable angina pectoris (group 1) and 334 patients with unstable angina pectoris (group 2). Clinical end points were death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, recurrent angina pectoris necessitating bypass surgery or repeat PTCA, and event-free survival. The two groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, previous myocardial infarction, ejection fraction, and number of diseased vessels. PTCA was successful in 83.0% of group 1 and 87.1% of group 2. Follow-up rates were expressed as events per attempted PTCA in a patient group. No difference in survival was observed between the two groups, the mortality rate being approximately 2.8% at 25 months. In the group with stable angina pectoris there was a lower incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction within the first 24 hours after angioplasty; 4.3% vs 9.0% (p less than 0.01). During long-term follow-up the increase in the incidence of nonfatal myocardial infarction was similar, resulting in an overall long-term follow-up infarction rate of 8.3% and 14.2%, respectively (p less than 0.01). A higher event-free survival was observed in group 1 within 24 hours after PTCA: 93.7% vs 84.2% (p less than 0.01). During subsequent follow-up the difference in event-free survival between the two groups was no longer significant: 68.5% vs 61.2%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine the predictors of long-term outcome after repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we analyzed the immediate and follow-up results of 144 patients who underwent a second PTCA procedure for restenosis of a previously successfully dilated lesion. Clinical success was obtained in 94% of patients. Emergency coronary bypass graft surgery was required in two patients (1%). Of the 136 successfully treated patients, 126 were followed for a duration of 6 to 36 months (mean 16, median 12 months). The follow-up coronary events (mutually exclusive) included cardiac death (2%), nonfatal myocardial infarction (2%), coronary bypass surgery (15%), and third PTCA (9%). According to results of Cox regression analysis, the independent variables associated with an increased risk of recurrent coronary events after repeat PTCA were: dilatation of a proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis at both initial and second PTCA (p = 0.001), time interval between the initial and the second PTCA less than or equal to 3 months (p = 0.001), multiple versus single-lesion redilatation at the time of repeat PTCA (p = 0.002), and the presence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.005). Thus repeat PTCA for restenosis is a safe and efficacious procedure, and it provides excellent long-term outcome in the majority of patients. Dilatation of a proximal left anterior descending artery lesion, a short time interval between the first and second PTCA procedures, diabetes mellitus, and redilatation of multiple lesions are predictors of recurrent clinical events after a second PTCA. Repeat PTCA should be considered carefully for patients falling within a high-risk profile for recurrent events after the procedure.\r"

Both trophoblasts and their culture supernatants stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. Culture supernatant had a moderate enhancing effect on lymphocyte mitogenesis in mixed lymphocyte cultures and in the presence of concanavalin A. Anti-human chorionic gonadotropin antibody suppressed the proliferative effect of trophoblast cells and their supernatants in the above experiments in a dose-dependent manner. At physiologic concentrations, both pure and impure forms of human chorionic gonadotropin enhanced (in a dose-dependent manner) proliferation of lymphocytes cultured alone (peak stimulation index, 6 to 7.8 at approximately 7 IU/ml). At higher concentrations (20 to 400 IU/ml) the proliferative effect was abolished. Trophoblast culture supernatant induced the expression of interleukin-2 receptors on lymphocytes after 48 hours of incubation. The supernatant also stimulated proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells. Thus trophoblast or trophoblast-derived human chorionic gonadotropin has a lymphocytotrophic function that may have implications for fetal survival.\r"

The immunized animals, as well as untreated and adjuvant controls, were challenged intravenously with 4 x 10(5) viable microfilariae (mf). The duration of microfilaremia was 15.5 days in rats vaccinated with whole mf, 17.7 days in those vaccinated with a PBS extract, 36.3 days for those vaccinated with adjuvant alone, and greater than 70 days for the untreated group. Analysis of the anti-microfilarial IgG response by ELISA and Western blots demonstrated that immunization induced significant amounts of antibody against high molecular weight peptides, particularly a peptide located at 105 kDa. Antibody levels in both groups of immunized animals continued to rise following challenge, reaching peak levels of 78-80 micrograms/ml on the day of microfilarial clearance. Decreasing microfilaremia following challenge was associated with an enhanced recognition of low molecular weight peptides.\r"

During follow-up averaging 26 months, six patients (12 percent) died. Four patients (8 percent) had episodes of rebleeding, only one from varices. All patients had patent shunts at subsequent angiography or ultrasonography. Despite consistent (100 percent) postoperative reversal or stagnation of portal flow on duplex scan, encephalopathy on clinical and psychometric grounds was observed in only three patients (6 percent). This study suggests that small-stoma portacaval shunt can be performed with reliably low rates of rebleeding and encephalopathy. That encephalopathy was rare despite loss of hepatic portal perfusion incriminates other factors besides portal flow in the genesis of postshunt hepatic failure.\r"

HBK kininogenase activity was measured by cleavage of radiolabeled purified high molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) (125I HMWK). Functional inhibition of the enzyme was present after co-incubation with either normal human plasma (NHP) or preparations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-PI). Stable HBK inhibitor complex was detected at 92 K by immunoblotting employing anti-HUK as a probe. Anti alpha 1-PI probes did not demonstrate the 92 K complex under identical conditions, raising the possibility of an additional co-purifying protein involved in HBK binding. alpha 1-PI antigenic and activity levels were measured in asthmatic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. In only a single sample of the six examined was alpha 1-PI activity detected. In two of the remaining five samples, low levels of alpha 1-PI antigen were present which were functionally inactive. In the BAL fluid containing alpha 1-PI activity, progressive functional inhibition of kininogenase activity correlating with HBK inhibitor complex formation occurred during BAL fluid incubation. In contrast, BAL fluid lacking alpha 1-PI activity failed to show progressive kininogenase inhibition or complex formation under identical conditions. In all experiments, the time course of HBK inhibitor interaction was markedly prolonged, requiring 150-min co-incubation with either NHP or the alpha 1-PI preparation for greater than 80% inhibition of function and near maximal complex formation. The slow rate of inhibition of HBK may allow for its continued activity and kinin generation in the airways of asthmatic subjects.\r"

We have investigated the relationship between cerebral hemodynamics and the subsequent risk of stroke in 30 medically treated patients with symptomatic occlusion or greater than 75% intracranial stenosis of the carotid arterial system. Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to evaluate the regional hemodynamic status of the cerebral circulation. Clinical follow-up to 1 year post-PET was available for all patients. The incidence at 1 year of all strokes was 1/9 for patients with normal hemodynamics and 1/21 for patients with abnormal hemodynamics. The 1-year incidence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke was 1/9 for hemodynamically normal patients and 0/21 in the abnormal group. The 21 patients in the abnormal group fulfilled entry criteria for the Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass Trial. The 0/21 incidence of ipsilateral ischemic stroke at 1 year was compared with the 1-year rate of 0.109 for the 714 medically treated patients from the Bypass Trial. We were able to reject with better than 90% certainty (p = 0.089) the hypothesis that our sample of patients came from a population with an ipsilateral ischemic stroke rate of 0.109 or greater. Thus, in this small sample, we found no evidence that PET evidence of abnormal cerebral hemodynamics identifies a subgroup of patients at higher risk for early stroke if treated medically with antithrombotic drugs.\r"

We used our model of HD-MTX neurotoxicity in the rat to determine if leucovorin (5-formyltetrahydrofolate) reduces this neurotoxicity, and extended our characterization of this model to identify regional as well as global HD-MTX treatment effects and to investigate HD-MTX-induced alterations in regional brain pH. Intravenous high-dose leucovorin reversed the HD-MTX-induced decrease in cerebral glucose metabolism and associated behavioral and electroencephalographic abnormalities in the rat, but low-dose leucovorin was ineffective. The major effect of HD-MTX on cerebral glucose metabolism was a global reduction; however, smaller region-specific treatment effects were identified in auditory, thalamic, and white matter structures. HD-MTX did not alter regional brain pH. These findings suggest a potential clinical role for high-dose leucovorin in severe or prolonged acute HD-MTX neurotoxicity and provide an important justification for the role of positron emission tomography in the early detection of clinical HD-MTX neurotoxicity.\r"

The records of 736 patients (group 1) who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from January 1975 to July 1981 were reviewed and compared with a group of 603 patients (group 2) who underwent operation from July 1985 to December 1987. The techniques of operation and myocardial preservation were virtually identical during the two periods. During the group 2 analysis period, 343 angioplasty procedures were performed. The patients in group 2 were significantly older, had increased preoperative New York Heart Association classification, had sustained more previous myocardial infarctions, and had more associated morbid medical conditions. There was a threefold increase in patients seen for reoperative revascularization procedures and a fourfold increase in emergency operations. Overall mortality, although not significantly different, did increase slightly from 2.69% in group 1 to 3.83% in group 2. Mortality after elective procedures remained essentially unchanged (2.05% for group 1 and 1.90% for group 2).\r"

Hospital mortality rates for coronary bypass grafting and angioplasty were 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively, and infarction rates were 1.7% and 5.1%, respectively (p less than 0.01). Including hospital events for the coronary bypass and angioplasty populations, actuarial survival at 5 years was 92.3% versus 96.3% (p = 0.04), freedom from myocardial infarction was 94.6% versus 88.1% (p less than 0.001), freedom from subsequent angioplasty was 99.5% versus 75.2% (p less than 0.001), freedom from subsequent coronary bypass grafting was 98.8% versus 84.9% (p less than 0.001), and freedom from all morbidity and mortality was 87.1% versus 66.0% (p less than 0.001), respectively. By Cox regression analysis for all 1,389 patients, only diminished ejection fraction and advanced age predicted poor long-term survival (p less than 0.001). The only significant predictor of nonfatal late events was having had coronary angioplasty.\r"

To determine whether stressful events before a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure precipitate myocardial ischemia, silent or symptomatic, and whether this can have an effect on the prognosis, 26 patients were evaluated before a bypass operation with continuous Holter monitor recording. Specific events monitored were signing surgical consent, receiving preoperative medications, shaving and preparing, and transfer to the operating room. A positive Holter result was defined as an ST segment depression of 1 mm or more lasting one minute or longer. Six patients (23%) were found to have one or more episodes of substantial ST segment depression, with a total of ten episodes lasting 208 minutes recorded. All episodes were silent and not associated with an increase in mean heart rate. The majority of episodes occurred randomly, although three episodes did occur between 5 and 6 AM at the time of transport to the operating room. This appeared to be related more to the circadian rhythm than to the stress of transport. No perioperative or postoperative myocardial infarctions occurred, and all patients were alive at 30 days. In conclusion, silent myocardial ischemia present in the immediate preoperative period does not appear to be related to specific preoperative events. Frequency of early morning ischemia may warrant changes in the medication schedule to provide additional protection during these hours.\r"

The differences in survival when patients were segregated according to age, sex, number of grafts performed, or graft conduit (internal mammary artery versus vein) were not significant. However, comparison of graft conduits revealed a significantly better (p = 0.02) overall acute event-free survival when the internal mammary artery was used.\r"

In this cross-sectional study, the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, locus of control, and defense style were all correlated with neurotic symptoms, but defense style added little to the variance explained by the other two.

This system has been successfully used at San Francisco (Calif) General Hospital for more than 2 years. It utilizes outpatient facilities and reduces the need for bronchoscopy. Sputum induced by inhalation of 3% saline mist, mucolysed, concentrated by centrifugation, and stained by a rapid modified Giemsa stain was the first diagnostic specimen examined in 404 episodes of suspected human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary disease in 358 patients. Pneumocystis carinii was found in 222 (55%) sputum specimens. In 118 episodes in which the sputum did not contain P carinii, bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and/or bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and P carinii was found in 50 (42%). These 118 bronchoscopy results, as well as evaluation of the subsequent clinical course of those patients who accounted for 64 episodes of lung disease and who did not have bronchoscopy following examination of nondiagnostic induced sputum, indicated a range of sensitivity for detection of P carinii in induced sputum of 74% to 77% and a negative predictive value of 58% to 64%. Mycobacteria were recovered from 11 (6%) of the induced sputum and 6 (12%) of the bronchoscopic specimens containing P carinii. However, only oral or environmental fungi were recovered from P carinii-containing induced sputum or bronchoscopic specimens. For those patients in whom P carinii was not detected, only the bronchoscopic specimens were cultured for Mycobacteria and fungi. Potentially pathogenic Mycobacteria and fungi were recovered from 16 (23.5%) and 34 (50%), respectively, of these P carinii-negative specimens. Analysis of these results, obtained under routine practice conditions, indicates that bronchoscopy should be reserved for those patients whose induced sputum examinations do not show P carinii and that mycobacterial and fungal cultures be performed only on bronchoscopic specimens in which P carinii is not detected.\r"

The pathogenesis of lung cavities associated with P carinii pneumonia has not been fully elucidated by detailed morphologic studies. This article describes a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and P carinii pneumonia who developed roentgenographically identified lung cavitation while being treated with azidothymidine. At autopsy, necrotizing vasculitis with vascular infiltration by Pneumocystis organisms was associated with lung necrosis and cavitation. No other causes of pulmonary cavitation were identified. Thus, in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, P carinii, per se, may result in lung necrosis and cavitation, possibly through the mechanism of necrotizing angiitis.\r"

From November 1985 to February 1988, 15 patients who were human immunodeficiency virus-positive underwent splenectomy for refractory immune thrombocytopenia. Eight patients had thrombocytopenia only, and 7 others were pancytopenic prior to splenectomy. Three of the 15 patients fulfilled criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome before splenectomy, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome developed in 5 patients during the follow-up period. The median duration of thrombocytopenia prior to surgical therapy was 6 months. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed hypercellularity with increased megakaryocytes. All patients had a therapeutic response to splenectomy. Long-term remission from thrombocytopenia/pancytopenia was achieved in 14 of the 15 patients during a follow-up period of 2 to 21 months. Splenectomy can be accomplished with an acceptable morbidity. Pneumonia developed postoperatively in 2 patients, but they did not manifest the characteristic picture of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. They had received vaccinations against encapsulated organisms preoperatively. We conclude that splenectomy provides a durable and lasting response for HIV-related thrombocytopenia. Vaccination for Streptococcus pneumonia and Haemophilus influenzae should be given prior to splenectomy although its efficacy is not clear in this group.\r"

The results were compared with those of other examinations that also detected an occipital lobe pathologic condition. Abnormalities of those examinations were highly specific to PCA occlusion. Positron emission tomography and pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials yielded high incidence of abnormality in the occlusive group (86% and 75%, respectively), and expressed the side of PCA occlusion if the occlusion was unilateral. Since pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials is popular and a low-cost examination compared with positron emission tomography, we conclude that pattern-reversal visual-evoked potentials is the most practical mean to explore PCA occlusion in the course of moyamoya disease.\r"

Since nearly all patients with KS, including those with HIV-associated KS, have a high incidence of HCMV infection, HCMV has been proposed to be etiologically associated with KS. Moreover, our previous studies showed the retention of HCMV morphological transforming region II (mtrII) in both transformed and tumor-derived cell lines. As a result, we focused on the nucleic acid hybridization analysis of both KS biopsies from AIDS patients as well as cloned KS endothelial cell lines for HCMV mtrII sequences. We also analyzed KS biopsy and KS cloned cell line specimens for HIV-1, HBV, HHV6, and EBV sequences, since these viruses have also been implicated in the etiology of KS. In one set of experiments, Southern blot analysis revealed the presence of HCMV mtrII sequences in two of six KS biopsies; in other experiments, HBV sequences were found in one of seven KS biopsies. No hybridization in any biopsy tissue was detected for HIV-1 DNA sequences. The analysis of six independently derived cloned KS cell lines was next studied. All these lines were negative for hybridization to the HCMV mtrII transforming fragment as well as to subgenomic fragments of HHV6 and EBV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

An 11% failure rate to standard antituberculosis treatment (n = 173) was observed at the Tuberculosis Treatment Center of Bujumbura (CATB) in 1985-1986. All resistant cases (n = 19) were HIV seropositive. Among 328 consecutive cases with tuberculosis at the CATB during a 3 month period in 1986, 54.5% were HIV seropositive, which is five times higher than the prevalence in the general population in Bujumbura. More female patients than male cases were HIV antibody positive (62 versus 49%, respectively; p less than 0.02). Persistent weight loss, cough, and an anergic tuberculin test were more common in the HIV-seropositive group. Among 48 household members of HIV-seropositive patients with tuberculosis, 6 (12.5%) new cases of tuberculosis were identified, compared with none among 28 household members of HIV-seronegative patients with tuberculosis (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-33.2). HIV infection is a new risk factor for tuberculosis in Africa, and HIV-infected cases of tuberculosis may be more infectious than HIV-negative patients. The AIDS epidemic may drastically complicate the diagnosis, management, and control of tuberculosis in populations in which both infections are endemic.\r"

In addition, rH IL-2 was able to accelerate host recovery from cyclophosphamide (CTX)- or radiation-induced bone marrow depression and peripheral blood leukopenia. Not only can rH IL-2 accelerate, in a dose-dependent manner, the return of bone marrow, peripheral blood cellularity, and CFU-C frequency to normal levels following cytoreduction by CTX or irradiation, but it also significantly increases CFU-C frequency to greater than normal levels. Furthermore, rH IL-2 can significantly prolong survival of animals receiving a lethal dose of irradiation or CTX. Thus, multiple mechanisms are responsible for the synergistic therapeutic activity associated with rH IL-2 and CTX. rH IL-2 does not act only as an immunomodulatory agent in the presence or absence of suppressor T cells, but also accelerates host recovery from cytoreductive agents, resulting in decreased leukopenia and perhaps resistances to secondary infection. Thus, rH IL-2 plus chemotherapy may increase therapeutic activity against neoplastic disease, not only by adding immune stimulation to the direct antitumor effect of the drug but also by allowing delivery of higher, more effective doses of chemotherapy.\r"

Supranormal multimers were found in all patients on at least one of two different occasions 9 to 12 months apart, whatever the duration and severity of the disease, but in none of the normal controls. Administration of low-dose aspirin (40 mg) to five of the 11 patients for ten days to inhibit the platelet release reaction slightly reduced the amounts of supranormal multimers suggesting that they might originate in part from platelets. Supranormal multimers may contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis by inducing platelet aggregation and enhancing adhesion to subendothelium under the conditions of elevated shear stress occurring in the partially occluded vessels of the arterial microcirculation of scleroderma.\r"

Short-term concanavalin A (Con A)-activated, purified T lymphocytes from patients on, as well as patients off, therapy had a significantly decreased proliferative responsiveness to a saturating amount of exogenous, recombinant IL-2 as compared to control subjects (P less than 0.005 and less than 0.05, respectively). Phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated IL-2 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was also substantially decreased in both patient groups with the median values of IL-2 produced being 2.2, 2.1, and 8.1 U/mL in the on therapy, off therapy, and control groups, respectively. In addition, PHA-induced expression of cell-surface receptors for IL-2 on PBMC was significantly decreased in both patient groups as compared to control subjects (P less than 0.01). Lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens (PHA, Con A, and pokeweed mitogen) was similar in all three groups studied. These results demonstrate that substantial quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of the IL-2-T lymphocyte system are present in the majority of treated patients with ALL, not only during maintenance therapy, but also for a prolonged period after the cessation of all chemotherapy. These long-lasting defects of the IL-2 system are most likely a late effect of chemotherapy and may result in increased complications in some long-term survivors of ALL.\r"

  ".W": "Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing of tumor cells is a radiation-sensitive function that in most subjects is completely abrogated by treatment of the effector cells with 3,000 cGy. The radiation sensitivity of LAK (lymphokine-activated killer) cells and their precursors, the bulk of which are NK cells, is undetermined. In this study, functional cytotoxicity assays and electron microscopy were used to determine the effect of radiation on the cytotoxic function of NK cells, LAK cells (generated by three-day culture of peripheral blood lymphocytes with IL-2), and LAK cell precursors (lymphocytes irradiated prior to culture with IL-2). For comparison, we analyzed the radiation sensitivity of lectin-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (LDCC), which is primarily a function of CD3+ CD8+ granular lymphocytes. We also analyzed the radiation sensitivity of nonspecific cytotoxicity mediated by mitogen-activated T cells (AK activity). Following 3,000 cGy irradiation, NK cells retained their ability to bind to tumor cell targets but, as shown by both morphologic and functional analyses, they did not undergo activation after conjugate formation, and were unable to release the content of their granules. In order to evaluate LDCC, lymphocytes were depleted of CD16+ cells and tested in a cytotoxicity assay in the presence of Con A. The radiation sensitivity curve was comparable to that of NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. IL-2-treated lymphocytes (LAK cells) were relatively radioresistant as compared with untreated NK cells, and their cytotoxic function was not abrogated until treatment with greater than 10,000 cGy. Cells receiving such radiation doses displayed cytoplasmic blebbing and damage of their cytoskeletal structures, with disruption of centrioles and microtubules, and disarray of the intermediate filaments. As was shown with NK cells, irradiated LAK cells formed conjugates with tumor targets but failed to degranulate. The radiation sensitivity of nonspecific cytotoxicity mediated by mitogen-activated T cells was identical to that of LAK effector cells. Doses up to 2,000 cGy did not prevent generation of LAK cells from blood lymphocytes, but 3,000 cGy did so. Blast transformation similar to that observed in IL-2-stimulated controls occurred when lymphocytes irradiated with 3,000 cGy were cultured with IL-2. These transformed cells were not cytotoxic and displayed a normal cytoskeletal apparatus but did not bear electron-dense granules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have used a limiting dilution (LD) culture approach to quantitatively assess frequencies of proliferating lymphocyte precursors (PLP), cytotoxic lymphocyte precursors (CLP), and interleukin-2 (IL-2)-producing helper lymphocyte precursors (HLP). Unseparated mononuclear cells (MNC) or purified T cells (E+) and leukemic B cells (E-) were cocultured under LD conditions with irradiated OKT3 hybridoma cells in the absence (determination of HLP) or presence of recombinant IL-2 (determination of PLP and CLP). Under these conditions, low frequencies of PLP, HLP, and CLP (f = 1/65 to 1/4600) were measured in unseparated MNC of CLL patients. In contrast, purified T cells (50% to 92% CD3+) contained precursors of proliferating, IL-2-producing and cytotoxic T cells in similar frequency as did T cells from healthy control donors (f = 1/4 to 1/24). Leukemic B cells rigorously depleted of T cells did not give rise to measurable frequencies of PLP, HLP, or CLP (f less than 1/50.000) except in one CLL patient where a significant frequency (f = 1/1700) of HLP was consistently present in E- cells, despite the absence of growth-inducible PLP and CLP. Taken together, these results indicate that comparable numbers of IL-2-producing helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells are present in B-CLL patients and healthy controls, respectively. The data are discussed with respect to reported T cell abnormalities in B-CLL.\r"

  ".W": "Human myeloma cells were purified from bone marrow aspirates from four patients having advanced myeloma, including one with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen-positive myeloma. All of these myelomas had marked bone lytic lesions. From the culture supernatants of these purified myeloma cells, bone-resorbing activities were significantly revealed by 45Ca-release bone resorption assay, and IL-1 activities were also detected by IL-1 bioassay (mouse thymocyte comitogenic assay). Sandwich enzyme immunoassay for IL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta revealed that IL-1 beta was responsible for IL-1 activity of these culture supernatants. Furthermore, the bone resorbing activities of these culture supernatants were completely neutralized by pretreatment of anti-IL-1 beta, but not anti-IL-1 alpha antibody. By Northern blot analysis, IL-1 beta mRNA was identified from these myeloma cells. Therefore, it is concluded that myeloma cells produce IL-1 beta, which acts as bone-resorbing activity in multiple myeloma.\r"

Among all cytokines tested, rh interleukin-3 (rhIL-3) selectively induced a significant formation of MCS (IL-3: 1.1 +/- 0.6 x 10(5) v control: 0.02 +/- 0.15 x 10(5) MCS/mL suspension) and dose dependent increase in formation of intracellular histamine (IL-3, 100 U/mL: 95 +/- 23 ng/mL v control: 1.8 +/- 0.8 ng/mL) in a bone marrow suspension culture system (analyzed on day 14 of culture). Besides MCS, formation of eosinophils was observed in this culture system in the continuous presence of rhIL-3, whereas IL-3 pulse-stimulation for three hours and subsequent exposure to control medium induced growth of MCS but not of eosinophils. By combined immunofluorescence/toluidine blue staining, MCS were found to express a cell surface marker profile that corresponds to the immunological phenotype of peripheral blood basophils (MY-7(CD13)+, VIM12(CD11b)+, VIM2+, MAX1-, MAX24- and YB5B8-). Furthermore, cultured MCS expressed surface membrane receptors for IgE and could be triggered for nontoxic histamine release by a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody. To evaluate a possible influence of IL-3 on basophil function, studies were extended to freshly obtained blood basophils (healthy volunteers, n = 3). However, like all other cytokines tested, rhIL-3 failed to induce basophil histamine release. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that IL-3 is a differentiation factor for human basophils.\r"

We also detected IL-5 mRNA in T cells from eosinophilic patients with IL-2 stimulation.

  ".W": "Previously we have demonstrated that, in contrast to various panspecific or multilineage hematopoietic growth factors, lymphocyte-derived erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) is lineage specific, stimulating BFU-E proliferation in serum-free culture by up to 600% of control values while failing to enhance nonerythroid colony formation. To further determine the cellular source(s) of this important erythropoietic growth regulator, we have separated normal nonadherent peripheral blood and splenic lymphocytes by nylon wool fractionation, SRBC rosetting, and panning with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). These unstimulated T- and B-lymphocyte-enriched populations were used as cell sources to produce conditioned media (CM) and to prepare plasma membranes (PM). When CM fractions or purified PM were assayed in serum-free human bone marrow culture, BPA was localized entirely to the B-lymphocyte-derived fractions. While CM or PM from unstimulated T lymphocytes failed to stimulate BFU-E proliferation, activation of T cells by either phytohemagglutinin-M (1%) or concanavalin A (Con A; 5 micrograms/mL) induced the expression of a factor on the PM and in the resultant CM that stimulated the formation of erythroid bursts. In addition to enhancing BFU-E proliferation, this T-cell factor stimulated the proliferation of CFU-GM and CFU-GEMM in serum-free culture. When compared biochemically (in terms of temperature stability, localization by ammonium sulfate fractionation, and sensitivity to dithiothreitol) or immunochemically (using antibodies specific for lymphocyte-derived BPA, GM-CSF, or interleukin-3 [IL-3]), as well as by lineage specificity, B- and activated T-lymphocyte-derived growth factors appeared to be distinct. The burst stimulatory activities expressed by recombinant human GM-CSF and IL-3 were immunologically distinct from that associated with octylglucoside extracts of plasma membranes from resting B lymphocytes. Our results suggest that the BFU-E-directed growth-promoting activity released from activated T lymphocytes is apparently due to GM-CSF, while both resting and mitogen-stimulated normal B lymphocytes express erythroid-specific BPA and neither GM-CSF nor IL-3.\r"

Sixty-five of 65 (100%) fetal PPP samples aged less than 35 weeks and seven of ten (70%) fetal samples aged greater than 35 weeks had unusually large vWF (ULvWF) multimers. Thirty of 46 (65%) cord PPP samples from neonates ranging in gestational age from 34 to 41 weeks had ULvWF. There was no significant relationship between either gestational age at time of delivery or birth weight and likelihood of finding ULvWF multimers in cord PPP samples. No maternal PPP sample contained ULvWF multimers. Serial heelstick samples from 16 preterm and term neonates were analyzed for 8 weeks. ULvWF multimers disappeared from the PPP of ten of the neonates during this time. The PPP of four neonates had vWF patterns similar to those in normal adult PPP throughout the sampling period. The ULvWF multimeric forms of fetal and neonatal PPP samples were similar to those constitutively released from endothelial cells. They were not as slowly migrating in a very porous 0.5% agarose gel system as the ULvWF multimers released from Weibel-Palade bodies in response to the calcium ionophore A23187. A vWF protomer was present in 97% of fetal samples, 83% of cord blood specimens, and 11% of neonatal heelstick samples, but was not found in any maternal sample. These results indicate that control mechanisms operative in older children and adults to prevent circulation of ULvWF multimers and vWF protomeric forms are normally acquired late in uterine life or during the neonatal period. ULvWF multimers, which are normal components of fetal, most cord, and some neonatal plasma samples, may contribute to in utero and postnatal hemostasis.\r"

  ".U": "89229430\r", 
  ".W": "Controversy exists in the literature concerning the potentiating effect of heparin on the inactivation rate of factor XIa by antithrombin III (AT III) in both purified systems and in plasma. We have analyzed the factors that could influence this reaction and found that ionic strength of the medium, as well as the type and concentration of the heparin preparations accounted for the major discrepancies in the literature. At I = 0.43 N, a preparation of bovine lung heparin at 1 U/mL did not augment the inactivation rate of factor XIa by inhibitors in plasma or by purified AT III. However, when ionic strength was decreased, a progressive increase in the potentiating effect was observed, reaching 6.5-fold at I = 0.15 N. At saturating concentrations of heparin, which results in the formation of 100% AT III-heparin complex, (greater than ten-fold molar excess over AT III) in purified systems, all heparin preparations (porcine, bovine, low molecular weight [LMW], and high affinity) yielded an approximately 30-fold augmentation of the factor XIa inactivation rate. However, when heparin was less than saturating, we observed that various heparin preparations affected the AT III-induced inactivation of factor XIa to different degrees even though they exhibited the same inhibitory activity (1 U/mL) against thrombin. This variation resulted from differences in the number of AT III binding sites in each heparin preparation, despite a similar Kd for each. Addition of high molecular weight kininogen (HK) to AT III-heparin complexes did not enhance their ability to inhibit factor XIa, and high concentrations of HK decreased the inactivation rate. A high therapeutic dose of heparin only permits the formation of 2.5% to 16.5% of the AT III-heparin complexes that can be achieved at saturation. We observed that 1 U/mL heparin (bovine lung heparin) (high therapeutic concentration) in virtually undiluted plasma only accelerated the inactivation rate of factor XIa (in the absence of other active enzymes) less than two-fold. These new observations further support our previous conclusion that therapeutic levels of heparin have little to no influence on the inactivation rate of factor XIa in plasma.\r"

  ".W": "Single chain factor VII is converted by limited proteolysis to its activated form, factor VIIa, by a number of blood coagulation proteases including factor IXa and factor Xa. We have determined the relative rate of human factor VII activation by human factors IXa and Xa in two different systems: one containing Ca++ and human bladder carcinoma (J82) cells, and the other containing Ca++ and mixed brain phospholipids. The rate of factor VII activation was determined by a one stage coagulation assay, and proteolytic cleavage of factor VII was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting techniques. On a molar basis, factor Xa was sixfold more efficient than factor IXa beta in activating factor VII when the activation reaction occurs on J82 cell surfaces. In contrast, when incubation takes place in a suspension of mixed phospholipids, factor Xa was 18-fold more efficient in activating factor VII than factor IXa beta. In addition, factor IXa alpha activated factor VII at a rate approximately one-half that observed using factor IXa beta. In the absence of cells or phospholipids, no activation of factor VII by either factors IXa or Xa was observed. The addition of stoichiometric amounts of either recombinant human factor VIII (des B-domain) or plasma-derived factor VIIIa failed to augment the rate of factor VII activation by either factors IXa alpha or IXa beta. Likewise, purified human factor Va failed to influence the rate of factor VII activation by factor Xa in either system. Collectively, our studies reveal that J82 cells possess procoagulant phospholipid capable of readily supporting the activation of factor VII by either factors IXa beta or Xa. Our data also demonstrate that the relative ability of factor IXa beta and Xa to activate factor VII is significantly different when these reactions occur on tumor cell surfaces as compared with suspensions of mixed phospholipids.\r"

Eosinophils participate in the host response to parasitic infection and allergic and hypersensitivity diseases. The role of IL-1 in these disease states has not been extensively explored. We have reported that purified human monocyte derived IL-1 (mIL-1), a mixture of the two IL-1 forms but predominantly consisting of IL-1 beta, modulates eosinophil oxidative metabolism and enzyme secretion. Although the two major species of IL-1 (IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta) have identical specific activities on T cells, we now report the selective effects of human recombinant IL-1 (hrIL-1) alpha and hrIL-1 beta on eosinophil function. Whereas hrIL-1 beta caused a significant increase in arylsulfatase secretion (235.4 +/- 29% of resting secretion, P less than or equal to .01) and beta-glucuronidase secretion (135.8 +/- 9.6% of resting secretion, P less than or equal to .02) similar to our experience with mIL-1, hrIL-1 alpha had no effect on enzyme secretion. However, a mixture of hrIL-1 alpha and hrIL-1 beta reproduced the ability of mIL-1 to inhibit the oxidative response to suboptimal doses of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). When eosinophils were separated into subpopulations by density gradients, we found that eosinophil responses to IL-1 differed among the populations. These results suggest that eosinophil subpopulations respond selectively to each form of IL-1.\r"

The tumor marker was the paraprotein idiotype. Low numbers of tumor cells were found in the blood of most of the patients. In some patients, the circulating tumor cells were solely B lymphocytes, whereas in other patients, they were lymphoid, lymphoplasmacytoid, and plasmacytoid. Dual surface antigen analysis of blood and bone marrow cells confirmed that the tumor may be composed of a spectrum of cell types. Thus, cells may range from surface-idiotype+,CD19+,CD20+, PCA-1-,cytoplasmic-idiotype- lymphocytes, to CD19-,PCA-1+,cytoplasmic-idiotype+ plasma cells that are surface-idiotype- or weakly surface-idiotype+. In one patient, some of the tumor cells co-expressed surface idiotype and CD10. The tumor B lymphocytes were activated in vitro to synthesize paraprotein by pokeweed mitogen (PWM), and by low molecular weight B cell growth factor (BCGF). In contrast, spontaneous synthesis of paraprotein by more mature tumor cells was inhibited by agents that also inhibit nonmyeloma plasma cells. These agents included PWM, gamma interferon, and phorbol ester. The results demonstrate that in multiple myeloma there exist different tumor cell types that are similar, by a variety of criteria, to normal B lineage cells at different stages of differentiation. Thus, further evidence is provided for the hypothesis of myeloma cell differentiation.\r"

We used these fractionated populations in a two stage liquid/semisolid culture system and have assessed the effect of erythropoietin (Epo) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) on the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitors in the presence or absence of early progenitors. We found that populations that contained CFUe but were depleted of BFUe failed to show any amplification of CFUe or e-clusters in the presence of Epo (or Epo plus IL-3). In contrast, populations containing BFUe yielded a striking (sixfold for CFUe; 23-fold for e-clusters) expansion of late progenitors in the presence of Epo. Maximum amplification (15-fold for CFUe; 32-fold for e-clusters) was achieved when both IL-3 and Epo were present in culture. Our results imply that CFUe and e-clusters lack the capacity to amplify their numbers and suggests that the expansion of late erythroid progenitors during rapid erythroid regeneration is accomplished by influx of BFUe rather than amplification of CFUe. These data are of relevance to models of acute marrow expansion and to the mechanism of activation of fetal hemoglobin production during rapid erythroid regeneration.\r"

  ".W": "This paper describes the potential advantages to medical diagnosis and treatment that might be obtained from the wider application of positron emission tomography as a clinical tool. Developments along the lines suggested here will require a radical change in thinking from both clinicians and the medically related scientific community in the UK and some enlightened and resourceful funding from a mixture of charitable, industrial and government sources. If these ideas are to be pursued successfully, then the work must start now on a much wider scale than is presently perceived in the UK, and close collaboration between physicists, engineers, chemists, biochemists, clinicians and industrialists is needed. Furthermore, it is imperative that the scientific developments now underway in silicon technology, parallel data processors, biochemical and pharmacological processes and even high-temperature superconductors be kept under close and constant review by those associated with the technological advancements of medicine, so that the value of such developments is rapidly transferred to applications to medicine. This must include closer relationships between academic medicine and science than is the general rule in the UK at present. In conclusion, the scenario presented here includes the installation of regional cyclotron facilities to provide a large number of institutions in the UK with positron-emitter labelled radiopharmaceuticals. Additionally, agents labelled with radionuclides from in-house generators and other already existing higher-energy cyclotrons will provide a versatile and valuable range of radiopharmaceuticals for the study of human disease. These developments must be supported by the manufacture of lower-cost positron camera systems, as suggested here, connected to high-data-rate parallel processors to provide images of body function and to determine the effects brought about by disease. These images may then be processed using algorithms based on kinetic models of the body systems to provide information about the basic biochemical and physiological processes of the body. Such a development could have a profound effect on our knowledge of human disease and on our ability to control and treat it successfully.\r"

  ".W": "Intimal tear or dissection is an important descriptor of ischemic complications after coronary angioplasty, but only the minority of patients will develop an acute ischemic event. To identify additional factors that may predict the development of an ischemic event when arterial disruption occurs during otherwise uncomplicated angioplasty, the records of 1,346 patients prospectively identified as having tear or dissection without immediate vessel closure were examined. Ischemic complications, defined as ischemic chest pain, myocardial infarction, the need for coronary bypass surgery, or death, occurred in 120 patients (9%). Significant multivariate correlates of an ischemic complication were the presence of unstable angina or a totally occluded vessel before angioplasty and diameter stenosis of greater than 30% after angioplasty. Detailed geometric and videodensitometric analysis of the postdilatation angiograms of a subset of 96 consecutive patients was carried out. Ischemic complications occurred in 11 patients (11%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the independent correlates of complications, in decreasing order of importance, were the length of the tear or dissection (p = 0.001), diameter stenosis after angioplasty (p = 0.001), cross-sectional area after dilatation measured by videodensitometric methods (p = 0.013), and the presence of extraluminal contrast (p = 0.044). When tear or dissection occurs during otherwise uncomplicated coronary angioplasty, patients at risk of developing delayed ischemic complications can be identified and may benefit from measures designed to minimize this risk. By controlling for the geometric or mechanical factors that result in tear or dissection, it has been possible to identify factors not previously thought associated with ischemic complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An endothelium-dependent vasodilator response to acetylcholine has been described recently in patients with coronary artery disease. Those studies determined responses only of large epicardial arteries. Our study was designed to determine the integrated effects of acetylcholine on epicardial diameter, coronary flow, and vascular resistance. Patients (n = 64) with nonstenotic epicardial coronaries underwent coronary angiography with simultaneous recording of coronary flow velocity using a 3F subselective Doppler catheter. Measurements of epicardial arterial cross-sectional area (ECA), velocity, estimated flow (velocity times area), and vascular resistance were made before and after bolus administration of acetylcholine (100 micrograms i.c.). Similar measurements were made after papaverine (12-15 mg i.c.), a nonendothelium-dependent vasodilator. Acetylcholine resulted in a reduction of ECA of 19 +/- 3%, whereas papaverine increased ECA by 9 +/- 2%. Estimated flow increased 69 +/- 12% after acetylcholine and 147 +/- 12% after papaverine. Resistance fell after both agents (acetylcholine, -17 +/- 13%; papaverine, -61 +/- 2%). Transvascular resistance fell after acetylcholine in all but five patients. These patients had dramatic epicardial artery constriction (40 +/- 8% decrease in ECA). The effect of acetylcholine on both ECA and resistance was blocked by atropine (1 mg i.c.). Nitroglycerin (300 micrograms i.c.) resulted in epicardial dilatation (7.5 +/- 2.8%) in the same patients in whom acetylcholine caused constriction (-11.2 +/- 3.1%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that reversible 201Tl perfusion defects, compatible with silent myocardial ischemia, commonly develop during exercise in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To determine whether this represents a dynamic process that may be modified favorably by medical therapy, we studied 29 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients with HCM, aged 12-55 years (mean, 28), with exercise 201Tl emission computed tomography under control conditions and again after 1 week of oral verapamil (mean dosage, 453 mg/day). Treadmill time increased slightly during verapamil (21.0 +/- 3.6 to 21.9 +/- 2.7 minutes, p less than 0.005), but peak heart rate-blood pressure product was unchanged (26.3 +/- 6.0 X 10(3) compared with 25.0 +/- 6.4 X 10(3). Two midventricular short-axis images per study were divided into five regions each, and each of these 10 regions was then analyzed on a 0-2 scale by three observers blinded with regard to the patients' therapy. Average regional scores of 1.5 or less were considered to represent perfusion defects, and a change in regional score of 0.5 or more was considered to constitute a significant change. During control studies, 15 patients (52%) developed perfusion defects with exercise (average, 3.7 regions per patient). In 14 of these patients, all perfusion defects completely reversed after 3 hours of rest; one patient had fixed defects. After administration of verapamil, exercise perfusion scores improved in 10 of the 14 patients (71%) with reversible defects; there was overall improvement in 34 of 50 (68%) regions with initially reversible perfusion defects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the relationship between Campylobacter pylori (CP) and histology in gastric subepithelial hemorrhages from 20 actively drinking alcoholic patients. Biopsies of the hemorrhagic lesions and adjacent mucosa 1 and 3 cm away were taken with a \"jumbo\" forceps. Biopsy slides were coded and randomized before histologic scoring and examination for CP. CP was present in 15/20 (75%) biopsies of subepithelial hemorrhages and in 32/40 (80%) biopsies from surrounding mucosa. The mean hemorrhage score was not significantly different in biopsies of subepithelial hemorrhages with and without CP (2.7 +/- 0.4 vs 3.2 +/- 0.4) and the edema scores in adjacent, nonhemorrhagic mucosa were similar in specimens with and without CP (2.0 +/- 0.3 vs 1.6 +/- 0.5). The inflammatory cell density was significantly greater in CP-positive biopsies than in CP-negative specimens (2.0 +/- 0.2 vs 0.5 +/- 0.2, P less than 0.05) with the mononuclear cell and neutrophil scores contributing equally to the overall inflammatory cell score. Almost a quarter of CP-positive specimens (11/47) had no inflammation. The mean score for lining epithelial abnormalities was also significantly higher in biopsy specimens positive for CP (1.7 +/- 0.2 vs 0.5 +/- 0.3, P less than 0.05). In conclusion, CP is present in 75% of alcohol-associated subepithelial hemorrhages, but its prevalence is similar in adjacent, nonhemorrhagic mucosa. No relationship exists between the presence of CP and the characteristic histologic abnormalities of these subepithelial hemorrhages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study investigated whether stimulation of these neurons by intragastric administration of capsaicin would protect against aspirin-induced mucosal damage in the luminally perfused rat stomach. Capsaicin (25-640 microM), administered together with acidified (pH 1.5) aspirin (25 mM), inhibited macroscopically visible lesion formation and gastric bleeding in a concentration-dependent fashion. Capsaicin (160 microM) also attenuated the aspirin-induced fall in the gastric potential difference. An inhibitory effect of capsaicin (160 microM) on aspirin-induced gastric injury was also seen by light and scanning electron microscopy. Aspirin alone caused a vast ablation of the gastric surface epithelium, resulting in exposure of the lamina propria. In the presence of capsaicin, the depth of mucosal injury, the area totally deprived of surface epithelial cells, and the severity of surface desquamation were diminished. As capsaicin is a selective stimulant of thin afferent neurons, it would appear that these neurons participate in mechanisms of gastric defense against aspirin injury. Prevention of hemorrhagic damage seems to be the primary effect of afferent nerve-mediated gastroprotection, although injury to the surface epithelium is also reduced to some degree.\r"

All were treated with endoscopic neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser coagulation. Endoscopic and hematologic improvement were evident in 12 patients available for follow-up after a median period of 6 mo. There was a median increase of 4 g/dl in hemoglobin concentration; thus, the need for transfusion was eliminated. No major complications were encountered. Laser coagulation for watermelon stomach appears to be safe and efficacious and may be a therapeutic alternative for this disorder.\r"

Intestinal mass (mucosal weight and protein content) as well as the in vivo absorption of 5 mM glucose, valine, and aspartic acid were measured. In the jejunum, long-chain triglycerides were the most trophic, whereas in the ileum, long-chain triglycerides and dextrose were equally effective, but significantly more trophic than medium-chain triglycerides. In general, absorptive function was better maintained by dextrose and medium-chain triglycerides than long-chain triglycerides in the jejunum or by dextrose in the ileum. These data demonstrate that the jejunum and ileum respond differently to caloric substrates. Medium-chain triglycerides do not appear to have a clear superiority to long-chain triglycerides or dextrose in producing intestinal adaptation.\r"

The mucosa and submucosa of the grafts were infiltrated by mononuclear and polynuclear leukocytes, and lymphocytes were scattered along the myenteric ganglia. Three to five days later (phase II) the infiltrate intensified and was associated with villous flattening and sloughing of epithelial cells. The muscular layer was invaded by numerous lymphocytes and neutrophils. At the end of the rejection episode complete destruction of the mucosa and the muscular layer developed (phase III). As no lesion other than lymphocytic infiltration could be detected in the mucosa in phases I and II of rejection, which may be considered reversible, and this change is known to be unspecific, biopsies of the mucosa alone are inadequate for a purely histologic diagnosis of small bowel allograft rejection.\r"

As part of a controlled clinical study, 265 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who did not have esophageal varices at entry were followed for a median of 5.6 yr. The mean age was 49 yr (range 26-75 yr), 89% were women, and 69% had advanced histologic stage disease (stage 3-4) on liver biopsy at study entry. All patients were screened annually for esophageal varices by barium esophogram or endoscopy, or both; endoscopy was used to diagnose all episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. Esophageal varices developed in 83 (31%) patients, and 40 (48%) of those with esophageal varices experienced one or more episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. Cox regression analysis indicated that only serum bilirubin and histologic stage were associated independently with time to development of esophageal varices. In patients who developed esophageal varices, 33% and 41% developed esophageal variceal bleeding at 1 and 3 yr, respectively. After development of esophageal varices, 1- and 3-yr survival estimates were 83% and 59%, respectively. After the initial variceal bleeding episode, survival estimates were 65% and 46% at 1 and 3 yr and were dependent on Child's classification. These findings are important in considering indications for prophylactic therapy for esophageal varices in primary biliary cirrhosis and may influence timing of liver transplantation.\r"

Lines were established as outgrowths from biopsy specimens in microculture using a combination of T cell mitogens, indomethacin, interleukin (IL-2) and autologous irradiated feeder cells. The predominant phenotype of T cells after six to 12 weeks in culture was CD2, CD3, and CD4 positive. Functionally, these T cell lines secreted IL-2 in response to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in combination, but not to PHA or PMA alone. Two to 7% of cells in each line expressed natural killer (NK) cell-associated markers--that is, Leu 7, CD16, and Leu 19. Moreover, such cells were cytotoxic for NK sensitive targets, but not for NK resistant targets or allogeneic or autologous Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) transformed B cells. Sufficient numbers of small intestinal lymphoid cells for study were previously available only from patients undergoing surgical resections of the small bowel. The ability to isolate and culture human small intestinal T lymphocytes from gastroscopic intestinal biopsies provides an important new tool for studies of human small intestinal lymphocytes.\r"

In a study of 194 cirrhotic patients with bleeding esophageal varices in whom 2-day mortality was 3%, statistically significant differences in both survival and rebleeding rates were obtained by shifting the starting point for analysis of survival by 2 weeks following admission to hospital or by 5 days for the analysis of rebleeding. In addition, the curve of hazard function for death or for failure to control bleeding following admission clearly showed that any change in entry time in a study of variceal bleeding would introduce bias and alter survival or rebleeding rates. Thus, the starting point for analysis following variceal hemorrhage is an important confounding variable when calculating both survival and rebleeding. It should always be taken into account, particularly in clinical trials, which are often performed in centers where patients are referred from other hospitals at different times following bleeding.\r"

The CRH dose used only moderately increased plasma ACTH and cortisol levels; the changes in SWS and REM sleep during CRH infusion were in the same direction as occurred during the cortisol infusion, but were not significant. These results suggest that cortisol has a sleep modulatory effect. The decrease in REM sleep during the ACTH infusion may be mediated by the rise in endogenous cortisol. However, ACTH specifically altered sleep, in that it inhibited the cortisol-induced increase in SWS. Peripherally administered CRH had no intrinsic influence on sleep.\r"

  ".W": "Successful transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease leads to secondary adrenal insufficiency in most patients. This form of transient adrenal insufficiency is thought to result from hypothalamic and pituitary suppression due to the preceding hypercortisolism. Whether the rate-limiting step in the recovery of adrenal function in this setting is the hypothalamic CRH neuron or the pituitary corticotroph cell, however, is not known. We studied this question by examining the response to ovine CRH (oCRH) before, during, and after prolonged pulsatile administration of human CRH (hCRH) beginning 1-2 weeks after curative microadenomectomy for Cushing's disease. Five patients cured of Cushing's disease received eight hCRH injections (1 microgram/kg) daily for 7 days. This CRH regimen was found previously to normalize plasma ACTH and cortisol patterns in patients with secondary adrenal insufficiency who had normal ACTH responses to a single injection of oCRH (hypothalamic adrenal insufficiency). The plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH (1 microgram/kg at 2000 h) were assessed immediately before, 2.5 h after, and 7 days after the end of pulsatile hCRH administration. To control for time-related improvement in the hormonal response to ovine CRH, an additional five patients cured of Cushing's disease underwent oCRH tests 1-2 and 3-4 weeks after transsphenoidal surgery, but did not receive hCRH. There was no significant difference in basal or oCRH-stimulated plasma ACTH and cortisol levels among any of the three oCRH tests in the patients who received hCRH. The baseline and oCRH-stimulated plasma ACTH and cortisol levels 1-2 and 3-4 weeks after surgery in the patients who did not receive pulsatile hCRH were similar to the values at those times in the patients who received pulsatile hCRH. Compared to normal subjects, however, both the hCRH-treated and non-hCRH-treated patients had significantly decreased peak and time-integrated plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH. We conclude that an impaired pituitary response to CRH contributes to the postoperative hypocortisolism of patients recently cured of Cushing's disease, and that this impaired pituitary response to CRH is not reversible by 1 week of pulsatile hCRH administration.\r"

IL-1 also has been found to be secreted in significant amounts by placental macrophages. To determine the possible role of IL-1 within the placenta, we studied the effects of human recombinant IL-1 on hCG release by long term cultures of human first trimester trophoblast and the JAR (human choriocarcinoma) cell line. IL-1 in concentrations ranging from 10(-11)-10(-9) mol/L stimulated hCG release from trophoblast cultures. This stimulatory effect was not mediated by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), as indicated by the inability of indomethacin to block this stimulation as well as a lack of IL-1 effect on PGE2 release by trophoblast cells. At these doses, IL-1 exerted no effect on hCG release by JAR cells. PGE2, when used in high concentrations (10(-6)-10(-5) mol/L), stimulated the release of hCG by the trophoblasts as well as by the JAR cells. Neither IL-1 nor PGE2 stimulated the proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, or differentiation (syncytium formation) of trophoblast or JAR cells. These results suggest that IL-1 may be an important local regulator of hCG secretion by first trimester trophoblasts.\r"

The outer membrane protein (OMP) profiles of 59 non-serotypable strains were examined by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). A comparison of OMP profiles suggested a possible association between several strains belonging to biotype 2. Although no clear correlation was established between biotype or OMP profile cluster groups and the age or clinical state of the patients from whom the strains were isolated, SDS-PAGE analysis was a useful technique for the epidemiological study of non-serotypable H influenzae.\r"

For detection of the cysts other stains such as toluidine Blue 'O' and methenamine silver must be used as well. Sulphation of smears before staining with Giemsa allows cysts to be visualised, thus enabling a single stain to be used to show all the stages of BAL or sputum, which is particularly useful, considering the increase in the prevalence of P carinii pneumonia in conjunction with the spread of AIDS.\r"
