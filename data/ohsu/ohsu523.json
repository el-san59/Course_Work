  ".U": "89088560\r", 
  ".W": "From 1964 to 1987, the EORTC Lymphoma Group conducted four consecutive controlled clinical trials on clinical stages I and II Hodgkin's disease in which 1,579 patients were entered. From the onset the main aim of these trials was to identify the subsets of patients who could be treated safely by regional radiotherapy (RT). Therefore, several prognostic indicators were prospectively registered and progressively used in the trial protocols for the delineation of the favorable and unfavorable subgroups as soon as they were recognized of high predictive value. In the H2 trial (1972 to 1976), the histologic subtype was the only variable taken into account for the therapeutic strategy and the staging laparotomy findings were found to be of prognostic value only in patients with favorable prognostic indicators. In the H5 trial (1977 to 1982), patients were subdivided into two subgroups according to six prognostic indicators. Patients with favorable features were submitted to a staging laparotomy (lap); lap negative patients were randomized between mantle field RT and mantle field plus paraaortic RT. Disease free survival (DFS) and total survival (S) were similar in the two arms. Among patients with unfavorable features, DFS and S were significantly higher in the arm treated by combination of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy (CT) and RT than in the arm treated by total nodal irradiation. Nevertheless, in patients below the age of 40, the overall survival rates were equivalent in the two arms. In the H6 trial, the delineation of the favorable subgroup was based on (a) absence of systemic symptoms and elevated ESR, (b) no more than one or two lymph node areas involved. The aim of the study was to assess the impact on survival of a therapeutic strategy including staging laparotomy. At a 4-year follow-up, no difference in survival was evidenced. In patients with unfavorable prognostic indicators, 3 MOPP-RT-3 MOPP were compared with 3 ABVD-RT-3 ABVD. From H1 to H5 trials, the proportion of patients having received CT during the course of the disease gradually decreased; the data suggest that a further reduction in the proportion of patients aggressively treated is conceptually possible. On the basis of the prognostic factors identified, one can delineate three subsets of patients and modulate toxic cost of the initial treatment according to the characteristics of these subsets. In the most favorable subgroup, RT alone produces high survival and CT is not justified.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Purified recombinant human heavy-chain (acidic) ferritin (rHF) was assessed in vivo in mice for effects on the proliferation (percentage of cells in S-phase) and absolute numbers of granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM), erythroid (BFU-E), and multipotential (CFU-GEMM) progenitor cells in the femur and spleen and on the nucleated cells in the marrow, spleen, and blood. rHF significantly decreased cycling rates and absolute numbers of marrow and splenic hematopoietic progenitors and marrow and blood nucleated cellularity. These effects were apparent in BDF1, C3H/Hej and DBA/2 mice and were dose dependent, time related, and reversible. Suppressive effects were noted within three hours for progenitor cell cycling, within 24 hours for progenitor cell numbers, and within 48 hours for circulating neutrophils. Additionally, hematopoietic progenitor cells in DBA/2 mice infected with the polycythemia-inducing strain of the Friend virus complex (FVC-P) were insensitive to the in vivo administration of rHF. These studies demonstrate activity of rHF in vivo on myelopoiesis of normal but not FVC-P-infected mice. Since rHF suppresses hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation from normal donors in vitro and from normal mice in vitro and in vivo but does not suppress progenitor cells from patients with leukemia in vitro or from mice with FVC-P-infection in vitro or in vivo, rHF may be useful as a candidate adjunct molecule for the protection of normal hematopoietic progenitor cells during chemotherapy.\r"

  ".U": "89088566\r", 
  ".W": "Recombinant human erythropoietin produced in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells is glycosylated much the same way as the erythropoietin present in human urine. To determine the role of carbohydrates in the stability of recombinant human erythropoietin in vivo, [125I]-labeled recombinant erythropoietin was intravenously infused into rats. The erythropoietin was slowly cleared from the blood with a half-life of approximately two hours. Asialoerythropoietin, which was produced by treatment of recombinant human erythropoietin with sialidase, was found to be cleared rapidly from circulation within ten minutes. These data suggest that the galactose binding protein of hepatic cells is involved in the clearance of asialoerythropoietin. Erythropoietin also contains N-glycans with a few N-acetyllactosamine repeats, which can be enriched by tomato lectin affinity chromatography. The lectin-bound fraction was cleared to a larger extent than was the unfractionated erythropoietin, while the component that did not bind the lectin was found to be stable in the circulation. Authentic N-acetyllactosamine repeats (polylactosaminoglycans) prepared from erythrocytes were similarly rapidly cleared from the circulation to the liver, and this clearance was inhibitable with asialo-alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. These results suggest that (a) the sialic acid of the recombinant erythropoietin is necessary for this glycoprotein hormone to circulate stably and (b) glycoproteins with more than three lactosaminyl repeat units may be cleared by the galactose binding protein of hepatocytes.\r"

To determine the present pediatric manpower situation a cross-country survey was undertaken of all pediatricians and their practice patterns. Of the 2060 recipients of a questionnaire 5% were found to not be pediatricians. Of the remaining 1960, 69% returned a completed questionnaire. Overall, 70% of the pediatricians were men, although among those less than 35 years of age 49% were women. Across Canada 37% of the pediatricians practised primary care, 25% secondary care and 38% tertiary care. There were wide regional differences in practice patterns, with large numbers of primary care pediatricians in Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and the province of Quebec; few pediatricians in the Maritimes and the remainder of western Canada practised primary care. Non-Canadian graduates accounted for 33% of the pediatricians and represented a considerable proportion of tertiary care pediatricians. Cutbacks in numbers of pediatric training positions and restrictions on immigration of foreign pediatricians may lead to unexpected deficiencies in the availability of some types of pediatric practitioners, especially those in tertiary care.\r"

The FEV1 was recorded at presentation before treatment and immediately after a decision to admit or discharge had been made. Of the 96 patients 10.4% were admitted, 10.4% were discharged but suffered a relapse, and 79.2% were discharged and did not suffer a relapse. The FEV1 had a low positive predictive value (47%) for admission or relapse when it was 0.7 L/min or less at presentation and 2.1 L/min or less before discharge or admission. The FEV1 did not alter the decision to admit or discharge in 97% of the cases. We believe that the FEV1 fails to identify patients who should be admitted or those who will likely suffer a relapse; however, patients with a final FEV1 greater than 2.4 L/min may be discharged with confidence.\r"

Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, hepatitis B virus markers, or histopathologic types of HCC had no correlation with the presence or absence of AR or ER and their titers. Also, there was no correlation between the AR and ER positivities.

Extensive bulky disease with organomegaly, central nervous system (CNS), and skin involvement were prominent features at diagnosis with a higher frequency in ANLL as compared to ALL. Four of six ANLL patients were classified as monocytic or myelomonocytic. In the ALL group nine of 24 (36%) were non-L1 morphology and six of 17 (33%) were common ALL antigen (CALLA) negative, the majority of them (five of six) were included in the non-L1 group. Immunophenotyping revealed four cases with early B-cell (three patients: Ia+B4+, and one patient: Ia+) and two cases with T-cell. Mixed lineage leukemia was found in five infants. Heavy chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was present in six cases tested, two CALLA+, two with Ia+B4+, and two were undifferentiated mixed lineage leukemia. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in ten of 18 patients, mostly in ANLL and CALLA negative ALL. Translocations were detected in six patients, involving 4q21-23 and 11q23 in three and two cases, respectively. The probability of five-year DFS were 27% for the whole group. The worst prognosis was observed in infants younger than 6 months of age, in whom the leukemia cell characteristics was compatible with stem cell: ANLL, very early pre-B, or undifferentiated mixed type. The chromosomal aberrations found in all cases included translocation with the seemingly nonrandom breakpoints at 4q21 and 11q23, and breakpoints that corresponded to known fragile sites. This finding may be suggestive of an underlying genetic predisposition associated with the poor prognosis of leukemia of infancy.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between cytogenetic findings and prognosis in 51 pediatric patients with neuroblastoma is described. Patients were classified into the following four groups based on karyotypic findings: (1) near diploidy, 42 to 47 chromosomes (n = 11); (2) hyperdiploidy, 50 to 56 chromosomes (n = 4); (3) near triploidy, 60 to 77 chromosomes (n = 33); and (4) hypotetraploidy, 80 to 83 chromosomes (n = 3). Patients with near diploid or hypotetraploid karyotypes also had several structural abnormalities including marker chromosome 1, with or without double minutes (DM) or homogeneously staining regions (HSR). Most of these patients were 1 year of age or older and had advanced tumors. The patients who were in the hyperdiploid or near triploid category had few structural abnormalities; all of them, except one, were younger than 1 year of age, had localized tumors, and are long-term, disease-free survivors. Kaplan-Meier analysis of survival rates disclosed a significant difference favoring the latter group (P less than 0.001). N-myc gene amplification was found in five patients of the former group but in no patients of the latter group. The presence or absence of DM or HSR in the former group had no statistically demonstrable effect on survival. However, the presence of marker chromosome 1 appears to indicate a poor prognosis. Five patients with Stage IV-S disease had near triploid abnormalities similar to findings in patients with localized tumors. We propose that localized and Stage IV-S neuroblastomas can be classified as one disease category, and that patients with near diploid or hypotetraploid karyotypes are clinically distinct from those having hyperdiploid or near triploid karyotypes. We consider that chromosomal pattern is a more influential prognostic factor than age, disease stage, or N-myc gene amplification.\r"

The VC was performed either after an initial treatment in order to detect cervical recurrences and metastases (16 patients) or to prove abnormal CT thyroid secretion before any treatment (one patient). In 16 of the 32 tumoral localizations suspected by VC (50%), a tumoral focus was proven. For selective/peripheral CT gradient value superior to 2.50, 12 localizations of 12 (100%) were proven and for CT gradient value between 1.50 and 2.50, four localizations of 15 (26.6%) were proven. In six patients with exclusive cervical MTC secreting sites, treatment induced a total remission in two cases (12%) and improved in four cases (23%). The authors conclude that VC has a real value to localize MTC secreting sites. A total remission or an improvement can be obtained after treatment when VC detects exclusive cervical tumors.\r"

  ".U": "89089492\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that ploidy is an important prognostic determinant in lung cancer, but in those studies followup was restricted to three years, while patients with Stage 1, 2 and 3 disease and with different histological subtypes were included. Theoretically, these factors could have influenced the findings, especially since aneuploidy strongly correlated with the stage of disease. Because of this, tumor ploidy was studied in surgically resected stage 1 (T1/2, N0M0) squamous cell lung cancer patients with a minimal followup of 6 years. All patients were accurately staged by mediastinal lymph node mapping. Fifty-two from a group of 1539 patients with lung cancer diagnosed between 1980 and 1986 inclusive, fulfilled these criteria. Of these tumors, 23 (44%) were diploid with a 6-year survival of 53% and 29 (56%) were aneuploid with a 6-year survival of 48%. Although diploidy tended to be associated with local relapse of the tumor and aneuploidy with distant metastases, the difference was not significant and neither showed a survival advantage. However, within the aneuploid tumors, there was a significant correlation between the percentage of aneuploid cells and survival, defined as event-free or time to death. Seventeen patients with a percentage of more than 10 had a worse outcome (12 died, 6 years survival 35%), than to the other 12 patients with less than 10% aneuploid cells (2 died, 6-year survival 78%) (Mantel-Cox = 6.04, P = 0.01). This implies that in patients with accurately staged and histologically proven Stage 1 squamous cell lung cancer and long-term follow up, DNA content classified as diploid and aneuploid is not a prognostic factor for survival, but the percentage of aneuploid tumor cells is correlated with the prognosis.\r"

These studies showed that cysts lined by atypical epithelial cells are frequently present in renal parenchyma adjacent to the renal carcinomas, and that the cytologic features of atypical cells lining the cysts were essentially the same as the cytologic features found in the adjacent well-differentiated, renal cell carcinomas. DNA quantitative studies revealed that both the renal cell carcinomas and the atypical cyst lining cells had the same DNA indices and were essentially DNA euploid. In this patient group these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the atypical cyst lining cells evolve into the renal cell carcinomas; however, they do not prove this proposed but likely sequence.\r"

The basal concentrations of iCT in serum from the antecubital vein ranged from normal values (less than 0.50 micrograms/1) to grossly elevated (greater than 100 micrograms/1). Intravenous pentagastrin injections (0.5 micrograms/kg) stimulated transiently calcitonin secretion in all patients and peak concentrations occurred in peripheral venous blood and in the inferior caval vein after 3 to 5 minutes. In all patients peak iCT values in the hepatic vein occurred at 1 to 2 minutes and were much higher than in samples taken from other veins. Only three patients showed metastases to liver as judged by conventional clinical and laboratory examinations. Two patients with nonthyroid, malignant disease did not show an increase in serum iCT concentration of hepatic veins. The authors conclude that MCT may spread early to the liver. The presence of liver metastases is an important prognostic factor in patient evaluation and can be demonstrated by measuring iCT in hepatic veins before and during pentagastrin stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Two of the most important prognostic indicators for breast cancer are tumor size and extent of axillary lymph node involvement. Data on 24,740 cases recorded in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute were used to evaluate the breast cancer survival experience in a representative sample of women from the United States. Actuarial (life table) methods were used to investigate the 5-year relative survival rates in cases with known operative/pathologic axillary lymph node status and primary tumor diameter. Survival rates varied from 45.5% for tumor diameters equal to or greater than 5 cm with positive axillary nodes to 96.3% for tumors less than 2 cm and with no involved nodes. The relation between tumor size and lymph node status was investigated in detail. Tumor diameter and lymph node status were found to act as independent but additive prognostic indicators. As tumor size increased, survival decreased regardless of lymph node status; and as lymph node involvement increased, survival status also decreased regardless of tumor size. A linear relation was found between tumor diameter and the percent of cases with positive lymph node involvement. The results of our analyses suggest that disease progression to distant sites does not occur exclusively via the axillary lymph nodes, but rather that lymph node status serves as an indicator of the tumor's ability to spread.\r"

The median follow-up period was approximately 10 years. Distant metastases developed in three patients (21%) (one patient was in Stage IA [11%] and two patients were in Stage IIIB [40%]). In two cases the development of distant metastases was preceded by local recurrence (14%). The 5-year survival rate was 93%. The 10-year survival rate was 81%. The high survival rate, even for patients with unfavorably thick melanomas, seems to be attributable to isolated regional perfusion.\r"

Women's sexual satisfaction, capacity for orgasm, and frequency of masturbation remained stable, whereas frequency of sexual activity with a partner and range of sexual practices decreased significantly by one year. Women who received irradiation with or without surgery resembled women who underwent radical hysterectomy alone at 6 months. By one year, however, the radiotherapy group had developed dyspareunia, which was reflected in gynecologist ratings at pelvic examination. The women receiving radiotherapy also had more problems with sexual desire and arousal, and were less likely to resume several daily life activities.

Assessment measures included the Rand General Well-Being Scale, the Rand Functional Limitations and Physical Abilities Batteries, and a semistructured interview. The relation of physical disability and limitations caused by cancer to patients' achievements also was evaluated. Although cancer patients, on the average, were more concerned about their health and reported lower general spirits than controls, no differences were found between control and study groups with regard to overall general well-being. More cancer patients than controls reported that their health limited their ability to engage in vigorous activities. A greater functional deficit was found among unemployed than employed cancer patients. Employers and co-workers often were aware of the patient's diagnosis (85% and 67%, respectively). Cancer patients reported disease-related discrimination in hiring (7.4%), induction into the military (66.7%), and obtaining health, life, and disability insurance (31.5%). There was no significant relationship between health status and employment. Nevertheless, cancer patients had a higher average income than controls. Sixty-four percent of patients believed that changes in certain physical features of the workplace were necessary to facilitate readjustment to the job. Despite the disabilities experienced by cancer patients and generally negative public attitudes, long-term survivors have a good outlook on life and are competitive members of the workplace and society.\r"

This study was a prospective randomized comparison of two regimens that had as their primary differences: (1) an intensification period with Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) and asparaginase after induction; (2) a period of intravenous methotrexate before initiating maintenance; and (3) in the regimen that had those two additions, triple-drug chemoprophylaxis of the central nervous system (CNS) using methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytosine arabinoside as compared to cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate. All patients received vincristine and prednisone induction, 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate maintenance, and vincristine and prednisone pulse intensification. There was no significant difference in the rate of bone marrow relapse. However, overall disease-free survival favored the arm with intensification and chemoprophylaxis because of a lesser incidence of extramedullary relapse. Thus, for treatment 1 versus treatment 3 the two-sided P values were for overall disease-free survival 0.16; bone marrow relapses 0.13; all CNS relapses 0.04; and all extramedullary disease relapses 0.013. It is concluded that intensification as delivered in this protocol protects against testicular relapse and that chemoprophylaxis is adequate prophylaxis against isolated CNS relapse.\r"

Twenty-two patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer received induction chemotherapy with methotrexate, cisplatin and a 5-day CVI of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Patients were randomized to receive the 5-FU portion of cycle 1 either by a standard inpatient CVI chemotherapy delivery device (standard pump) or by the Infusor (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL), a portable chemotherapy delivery system that provides a constant flow of drug over a period of 24 hours. For cycle 2, patients crossed over to the alternative drug delivery method. Patients receiving chemotherapy via the Infusor could choose to be either inpatients or outpatients. Daily plasma concentrations of 5-FU were determined during the first two cycles of chemotherapy. There was no significant difference in the mean steady state plasma 5-FU levels achieved with either drug delivery method (329.7 +/- 95.8 ng/ml for infusor cycles vs. 352.8 +/- 114.9 ng/ml for standard pump cycles). Clinical toxicities consisted primarily of mucositis for both methods of drug delivery. Eight patients declined to receive CVI chemotherapy as outpatients citing as reasons fear of malfunction of the device, inconvenience of the frequent clinic visits necessitated by daily monitoring of plasma 5-FU concentrations, and restrictions in daily home activities. Eleven patients underwent CVI chemotherapy via Infusor as outpatients. All reported outpatient CVI chemotherapy as convenient and effective and, when eligible, chose it again in subsequent cycles. A comparison of estimated costs revealed reductions in daily costs of +366.00 (+2,200.00 per cycle) for outpatient chemotherapy. Outpatient CVI chemotherapy is a reliable drug delivery method that was accepted by a majority of patients in this study. These factors may help to establish outpatient CVI chemotherapy as a viable alternative to hospitalization.\r"

The initial 133 patients received doxorubicin by bolus IV administration and for the next group of 141 patients doxorubicin was administered via a central venous catheter over a 48-hour (79 patients) or 96-hour (62 patients) continuous infusion schedule. Patients treated with bolus doxorubicin had this agent discontinued usually when 450 mg/m2 were reached; for patients in the infusion group treatment was continued until evidence of progressive disease or clinical or subclinical cardiac dysfunction developed. The complete remission rate was 21% the partial remission rate, 59%. There were no differences in response rate, response duration, or survival duration between groups of patients treated with doxorubicin by bolus, 48-hour or 96-hour infusion FAC. The incidence of moderate and severe nausea and vomiting was lower in the group of patients treated with infusion FAC as compared to bolus FAC (P less than 0.001); however, the incidence of mucositis was higher in the infusion group than in the bolus group (P less than 0.001). Doxorubicin administered by continuous infusion schedules was less cardiotoxic than when administered by bolus, as shown by a greater than 75% decrease in the frequency of clinical congestive heart failure at cumulative dosages greater than or equal to 450 mg/m2 (P = 0.004). Doxorubicin administered as a 48-hour or 96-hour continuous IV infusion is safer, and better tolerated than doxorubicin administered by bolus.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet kinetics were studied in 70 patients with testicular cancer to elicit the agent responsible for chemotherapy-induced transient early-onset thrombocytopenia; 204 treatment courses were analyzed using three different therapy protocols, which contained vinblastine and bleomycin either alone or in combination with cisplatin. Platelet count decreased significantly from the start of vinblastine administration reaching its nadir on the third day of therapy in each of the three treatment groups. Between day 4 and day 10 of the treatment cycle, platelet counts steadily increased even in patients still receiving continuous bleomycin infusions. The conclusion that the observed early-onset thrombocytopenia was caused by vinblastine was substantiated by the outcome of two additional examinations. Platelet half-life was significantly shortened 24 hours after vinblastine administration and electron microscopy revealed a dissolution of cytoplasmatic microtubules with loss of the typical discoid shape of platelets within 15 minutes after the start of therapy. Both findings occurred irrespective of the specific treatment protocol, i.e., even after nothing but vinblastine had been given. These results strongly suggest that vinblastine is the main cytostatic agent responsible for the transient early-onset thrombocytopenia observed during chemotherapy of testicular cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The localization and size of a high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of an extremity are generally the limiting factor in limb-saving surgery. Since 1982 nine patients with a high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of an extremity, which usually requires amputation, have been treated by intraarterial chemotherapy, preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy, and surgery. The limb was saved in eight patients (89%). During a median follow-up of 24 months (mean follow-up 32 months, range 12 to 64 months) one local recurrence and four distant metastases were diagnosed. Three patients developed complications due to the intraarterial chemotherapy, a motor and sensory neuropathy of the sciatic nerve was diagnosed in one patient, and two patients developed a flexion contracture of the knee. The results obtained in this small series show that the combination of intraarterial doxorubicin, preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy, and surgery is feasible in limb-saving treatment of primarily \"unresectable\" high-grade soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities without increasing the risk of a local recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "Preoperative chemotherapy with intraarterial cis-diamminedichloroplatin-II (CDP) and mannitol diuresis was administered to the primary tumor in 42 patients with osteosarcoma. The dose was 150 mg/m2 and more than 90% of the infusions were administered during a 2-week period. On occasion this period was extended to 3 weeks because of temporary renal insufficiency or logistical circumstances. Definitive surgical specimens were prepared by means of an arteriogram-directed plane of dissection with mapping and random sections. Histologically, tumor destruction was evaluated in terms of necrosis, inflammatory response, and fibrovascular regeneration. Quantification of the percent of tumor necrosis was as follows: less than 40% (consistent with spontaneous necrosis and/or no chemotherapy effect); 40% to 60% (possible chemotherapy effect); 60% to 90% (chemotherapy effect--partial response); and 90% to 100% (complete response). Therapeutic efficacy also was correlated with the number of CDP courses (one to three, four to five, and six to seven) and tumor subtype. Significant therapeutic effect (greater than 60% destruction) was observed with four or more CDP courses (one of nine tumors [one to three courses] versus 26 of 33 tumors [four to seven courses] [P = 0.01]). More than 60% of the tumor destruction was observed in the following subtypes: osteoblastic (22 of 28), fibroblastic (three of six), and telangiectatic (two of five). These data demonstrate that four or more courses of intraarterial CDP are required to achieve optimum effects and that osteoblastic osteosarcoma is highly responsive.\r"

Of the hysterectomy specimens obtained, 37% were positive histologically at 89 +/- 2.3 days after the start of radiotherapy and at 4 to 6 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy. Sixty-three percent were negative after a total external and internal cervix irradiation dose of 9642 cGy at point T. The average point A dose contributed by intracavitary therapy was 2104 cGy. The survival rate at 5 years was 84%: At 10 years the survival rate was 78%. The failure pattern was analyzed for patients who had positive and negative specimens. The patients with positive specimens failed pelvically or pelvically and distantly. Patients with negative specimens failed in extrapelvic or distant metastatic sites. Preoperative radiotherapy led to excellent local and pelvic control of tumor, and the failures became predominantly distant metastases. The combined radiosurgical therapy was tolerated well and allowed surgical staging of disease. This permitted earlier and selective consideration of adjunctive therapy (i.e., paraaortic irradiation, chemotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy). The dose-response data give insight into the effects of photon radiotherapy on bulky or barrel Stage IB cervical cancers and correlate histologic status with failure pattern, outcome, and long-term survival.\r"

These cases were clinically advanced and serosal invasions were evident. Activities of these enzymes were higher in the poorly differentiated tissues than the well differentiated type and in the normal tissues. Significant differences were noted between the poorly differentiated and well-differentiated types, in dTMP kinase (P less than 0.02), dThd kinase (P less than 0.05), dThd phosphorylase (P less than 0.01), and DNA polymerase (P less than 0.05). The authors' findings show that the level of pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, in both de novo and salvage pathways, is higher in the poorly differentiated gastric cancer tissues than in the well-differentiated type and suggest that antitumor drugs have an increased susceptibility in cases of poorly differentiated gastric carcinoma.\r"

The rectal cancer-specific mortality rate was 10.5%. None of the 27 patients without adverse prognostic factors died from rectal cancer, and for this group local excision alone was sufficient treatment. The only single factors associated with an adverse outcome were mucinous characteristics and full-thickness invasion. Ulceration alone and penetration into the muscularis propria alone were not adverse factors. In the presence of multiple adverse prognostic factors, mucinous characteristics or full-thickness penetration, local excision was inadequate treatment and an abdominal perineal resection was necessary.\r"

Marrow infusion was not used. In the 22 courses evaluable for tumor response there were 14 responses (64%) of which 11 were partial responses (PR) (50%) and three complete responses (CR) (14%). In the 12 evaluable courses given in patients with lymphoid malignancies a partial response was obtained in seven (58%) and complete response in two (17%) for an overall response rate of 75%. The median duration of response was short: 2 months (range, 1-12 months). Twenty-seven courses were evaluable for toxicity. All patients had nadir polymorphonuclear leukocytes counts less than 500/mm3 with median time to recovery to a level greater than 500/mm3 of 9 days (range, 6-21 days). The median nadir platelet count was 30,000/mm3. One patient had prolonged thrombocytopenia of 225 days. There were two toxic deaths related to leukopenia, one secondary to Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and the second from probable sepsis and cholecystitis. Nineteen patients had previously received cyclophosphamide in standard doses. In the patients with lymphoid malignancies who had previously received cyclophosphamide, 22% achieved a CR with an overall response rate of 78%. High-dose cyclophosphamide may be given with acceptable toxicity in heavily pretreated patients. Given the short response duration in patients with progressive disease, the optimal results of such high-dose cyclophosphamide may be achieved when it is employed earlier in the natural history of the disease in conjunction with other alkylators, or as consolidation therapy.\r"

The main side effects of this compound are myelosuppression, nausea and vomiting, stomatitis and/or mucositis, and skin rash. In this report, the authors describe the pattern of mucocutaneous side effects of Brequinar sodium in patients who received the drug by four different schedules: (1) short-term intravenous (IV) infusion every 3 weeks; (2) weekly; (3) twice weekly; and (4) five times daily every 4 weeks. Mucocutaneous toxicities of Brequinar sodium included mainly cytotoxic reactions (stomatitis and/or mucositis and skin rash). However, rare episodes of local reactions (phlebitis at the site of injection), photosensitivity reactions (to sun light), angioneurotic edema, and localized secondary hyperpigmentation of the inflamed skin also occurred. Stomatitis and/or mucositis appeared to be dose-dependent and schedule-dependent. The skin rash consisted of a drug-induced toxic dermatitis which occurred mostly at the highest dose levels. Initial recommendations for the management of mucocutaneous toxicities of Brequinar sodium during Phase II trials are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The production of human bombesin (gastrin-releasing peptide), a peptide with mitogenic action, is a recognized feature of neuroendocrine (small cell) carcinoma of the lung. However, immunostaining of bombesin is not always possible in these tumors, probably because of poor storage mechanisms or rapid release of hormone. Molecular biological analysis of the gene encoding human bombesin has revealed the DNA sequence of human pro-bombesin. We have used in situ hybridization to study the expression of the human bombesin gene at the cellular level in small cell carcinoma of the lung. Probombesin cDNA was subcloned in pSP64 vector, linearized with Bam HI and transcribed in the presence of phosphorus 32(32P)-cytosine triphosphate (CTP) and SP6 polymerase. The cRNA probe was applied to tissue sections (from six cases of small cell carcinoma of the lung, freshly fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde), cell culture preparations (two different cell lines of small cell carcinoma), and cytologic specimens (smears of cells from three different cases of small cell carcinoma). Hybridization of probombesin mRNA was detected in tumor cells in all samples. Specificity of the signal was determined by control experiments, including the use of a probe which has a sequence identical to probombesin mRNA. Our results provide evidence for the expression of the bombesin gene in small cell carcinoma of the lung at a cellular level and show that probombesin mRNA is highly expressed in these tumors.\r"

The distribution of FAB subtypes of childhood ANLL was similar to that reported for adults. In the initial year of the study, the inter-observer concurrence between the institutional diagnosis and the reviewing pathologists was 50%, but in the more recent years, concurrence between institutions and the review pathologist has approached 80%, averaging around 73% for the entire study. Many problems remain to be solved with this classification system, including the imprecision in wording, the subjectiveness of the interpretation, errors due to the random distribution of cells, and the current lack of evidence that certain FAB subtypes, such as M1 and M2, differ significantly in terms of biological behavior and prognosis.\r"

The plasma E2 binding of 79 breast carcinoma patients, 19 premenopausal and 60 postmenopausal, were compared to 46 controls, 21 premenopausal and 25 postmenopausal. In this study the authors removed the endogenous steroids with charcoal, incubated the plasma with 17-beta-E2 in non-saturation conditions, and used ammonium sulfate to precipitate the complex. The authors chose 17-beta-E2 as ligand because the plasma steroid binding system has not been shown to be homogeneous and because this binding function may vary independently for the different steroids. In these patients, the E2 binding was significantly (P less than 0.01) increased (85 +/- 11 pg/ml and 73 +/- 13 pg/ml in premenopausal and postmenopausal) compared to the normal controls (59 +/- 7 pg/ml and 58 +/- 5 pg/ml in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. It is still unclear whether this is a primary increase of the binding capacity or a reaction of the host for sequestering excess circulating E2. However, the small percentage of false-positives and false-negatives suggests that E2 binding could be used as a tumor marker in breast carcinoma.\r"

All patients had Stage III disease, and all subsequently were treated identically with concurrent radiotherapy, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. The series consisted of 18 squamous carcinomas, eight adenocarcinomas, and four large cell carcinomas. Morphometric measurements of randomized selected cancer cells per case included diameter of cytoplasm, nuclei, and nucleoli. Morphologic parameters evaluated were mitotic index, histologic differentiation, and pattern of nuclear chromatin of cancer cells, and the degree of necrosis and fibrosis of tumor tissue. The lymphoid and neutrophil index defined as the ratio of lymphoid cells and neutrophils to cancer cells from randomized microscopic fields (median = 25) at 400 x magnification were also determined. Our study indicated that the peritumor lymphoid index was the only factor significantly associated with the length of survival. The correlation coefficient (Pearson r) of these two factors was 0.5 (P less than 0.005). The median survival time of patients with peritumor lymphoid index less than 3 and greater than or equal to 3 was 95 days and 376 days, respectively (Kaplan-Meier estimation). The peritumor lymphoid index was an independent prognosticator of clinical outcome of Stage III NSCLC patients, and did not correlate with any of the other parameters analyzed.\r"

Elevated serum GST-pi levels were observed in patients with various gastrointestinal malignancies including gastric, esophageal, colonic, pancreatic, hepatocellular, and biliary tract cancers. Patients with benign gastrointestinal diseases had normal GST-pi, but some patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis had slightly elevated levels. Over 80% of patients with Stage III or IV gastric cancer and even about 50% of those with Stage I and II had elevated serum GST-pi. After surgery serum GST-pi levels returned to normal. Resected stomach cancers were immunohistochemically positive for GST-pi. During chemotherapy of colonic, gastric, and hepatocellular cancers with a series of different drugs, GST-pi changed in a biphasic manner; increases during initial phases of therapy may reflect acquisition of drug resistance by the tumor. In general, serum GST-pi assays provide a sensitive and reliable marker for gastrointestinal malignancies.\r"

Primary cancer sites included the following: non-small cell lung (n = 93), colon (n = 50), prostate (n = 23), oropharyngeal (n = 18), breast (n = 15), gastrointestinal (n = 13), and other (n = 42). Thirty-nine percent of patients had received no prior chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Common symptoms in the population were abdominal fullness (61%), taste change (46%), constipation (41%), mouth dryness (40%), nausea (39%), and vomiting (27%). Current caloric intake was surprisingly similar in 170 patients with weight loss (percent usual body weight [PUBW], less than or equal to 95%) compared with 84 without weight loss (PUBW, greater than 95%; 31.4 +/- 1.5 versus 30.5 +/- 2.1 kcal/kg/d, respectively). Symptoms identified by multivariate analysis as occurring significantly more frequently in populations with weight loss included abdominal fullness (P less than 0.001), taste change (P less than 0.002), vomiting (P less than 0.005), and mouth dryness (P less than 0.02). There was no difference in frequency of symptoms between patients with or without prior chemotherapy. These results indicate that gastrointestinal/oral symptoms potentially influencing weight loss are prevalent early in the course of cancer patients with unresectable disease, regardless of current nutritional status, caloric intake, or prior therapy experience.\r"

Except for two untreated, recently diagnosed patients, all were studied after 1 to 105 months (median, 27.5 months) of completion of polychemotherapy. Age ranged from 6.2 to 36.6 years (median, 13.6 years). Patients were divided according to treatment into four groups: (A) patients treated with CVPP (cyclophosphamide, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone); (B) 22 patients treated with CVPP plus radiotherapy (median radiation dose to the thyroid, 3000 cGy); (C) seven patients with ACOP/BVP (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, bleomycin, vinblastine, procarbazine); and (D) seven patients treated with different polychemotherapy protocols, four of whom also received radiotherapy. Elevated basal and/or post-TRH, -TSH levels were found in the following: Group A: two of 12 patients (17%); Group B: 11 of 22 (50%); Group C: four of seven (57%); and Group D: two of seven (28%). Positive antimicrosomal thyroid antibody titers (AM Ab) were found in the following: Group A: three of 12 patients (25%); Group B: six of 21 (28%), Group C: two of seven (28%); and Group D: one of six (17%). Of 46 patients studied, 12 (26%) had positive AM Ab; 37 of 46 patients were younger than 20 years of age, 11 (30%) of whom had positive AM Ab versus 4% in the normal population (P less than 0.001). Two recently diagnosed, untreated patients had either high TSH response to TRH or positive AM Ab. In conclusion, higher frequency of thyroid dysfunction was observed in patients receiving radiotherapy (50% versus 27%). Prevalence of positive AM Ab, apparently unrelated to therapy, was higher in young patients than in the normal population. A predisposition to autoimmune thyroid disease seems to be present in these patients, but it is not possible to discern how lymphoma and thyroiditis are interrelated.\r"

To determine the factors impacting on outcome, the results of a uniform treatment approach were evaluated and included primary surgical debulking (PSD) and systemic craniospinal axis radiation (CSRT) for suprasellar germinomas. Between 1976 and 1985 ten consecutive patients (seven females, three males) with the pathologically confirmed diagnosis of suprasellar germinoma were treated. Outcome was compared to four male patients with pineal germinoma treated over the same time period and series of patients reported in the literature. At diagnosis the mean age of patients with suprasellar germinoma was 13.9 years (range, 8.9 to 9.4 years). Symptoms were present for a mean of 18 months (range, 2 to 72 months) prior to diagnosis and included diabetes insipidus, anterior pituitary dysfunction, decreased vision, headache, vomiting, and diplopia. Staging studies, including myelography (n = 4) and cerebrospinal fluid cytology (n = 7), disclosed dissemination in only one child. Surgical treatment included biopsy in three cases, partial resection in five, and total resection in two; no permanent postsurgical complications were noted. The mean radiation therapy dose to the tumor site was 4953 cGy (range, 4400 to 5250 cGy) and to the spine 3354 cGy (range, 3000 to 4000 cGy). Patients were followed for a mean period of 5.1 years (range, 1.9 to 10.5 years). One patient with SG who did not receive treatment initially developed a pineal tumor after diagnosis; she was treated with PSD and CSRT and is asymptomatic 5 years later. All the remaining patients are alive and remain disease-free. Surgical resection and CSRT results in excellent disease control for children with suprasellar germinomas, and outcome is similar to those patients with pineal germinoma.\r"

In 79 patients, surgery was the only type of initial treatment. These 79 patients are the subjects of this report. Forty-eight (61%) of these patients were treated by total laryngectomy, whereas 31 (39%) had a partial laryngectomy. An elective unilateral radical neck dissection was performed on 31 patients considered at high risk, but metastatic disease was found in the dissected side of the neck histologically in only 32% (ten of 31) of these patients. The minimum follow-up period was 5 years and the maximum was 20 years. Twenty-nine percent of the patients (23 of 79) experienced a neck relapse. The neck relapse rate was the same whether the patients did or did not have an elective radical neck dissection. Among the patients who experienced a neck relapse, 65% (15 of 32) have died of the cancer. Among those who did not experience a neck relapse, none (zero of 56) have died of the cancer (P less than 0.01). These results indicate that in surgically treated patients with early stage supraglottic larynx cancer, neck relapse was the major cause of failure associated with death from cancer. Strategies for decreasing the relapse rate are discussed.\r"

The patients had a family history of breast cancer in a sister and mother or in two sisters. Risks were highest in sisters who had menarche at an early age or who first gave birth at a late age whether the patient had unilateral or bilateral disease, and with low parity only when the patient had bilateral disease. The bilateral group may have included a higher fraction of hereditary forms of breast cancer than the unilateral group. Because similar findings have been reported previously for breast cancer patients in general, the current results suggest that these reproductive factors have an effect on breast cancer risk independent of a family history of the disease. It is important, therefore, that the combined effects of these risk factors be taken into account when counseling women about their breast cancer risks.\r"

Five of the eight patients were young women (30 to 37 years of age). The tumors were poorly differentiated carcinomas and six of the eight patients have died of their disease. None of the patients had clinical evidence of endocrine dysfunction including the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Immunohistochemistry revealed cells with endocrine differentiation in five of eight tumors, and in two tumors gastrin producing cells were found. Five of seven patients showed increased numbers of antral G-cells. In two patients numerous endocrine (chromogranin-positive) cells were present in the fundic mucosa, specific products of which could not be identified with the antigens tested. No satisfactory explanation exists for this coincidence and its apparent predominance in young female patients. It may be that endocrine substances are responsible for this fundic hyperplasia and that they may also act as promotors of tumor growth.\r"

Her case demonstrates several of the typical clinical features of such cancers: late recrudescence of disease following a 40-year period of relative quiescence; delayed diagnosis due to misinterpretation of the clinical picture (intestinal obstruction, abdominal mass, intraabdominal abscess, and fistula formation) as due to inflammatory bowel disease; and an exceedingly poor prognosis with rapid widespread local dissemination and death. Histologically, severe dysplasia was demonstrated both in close proximity to and at a distance from the lesion. The increasing number of case reports of adenocarcinoma arising at the site of long-standing Crohn's disease, many with dysplasia within areas of diseased bowel, is further evidence that Crohn's disease is a precancerous condition. Physicians must continue to search for methods of earlier diagnosis to improve the prognosis of small bowel carcinoma in Crohn's disease.\r"

The most common primary tumors were colorectal (N = 45) and pancreatic (N = 20) carcinoma. When associated with pancreatic carcinoma, 65% of patients had liver metastases and 60% had ascites. The presence of ascites was associated with poor survival, with no patient surviving past 30 days. Ascites was also a sign of poor prognosis in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Among possible prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma patients, only disease-free interval, presence of lung metastases, and ascites showed statistically significant correlations with survival. Peritoneal carcinomatosis in sarcoma (N = 7) and breast cancer (N = 6) patients had median survival of 12 and 7 months, respectively. Surgical intervention for gastrointestinal complications in peritoneal carcinomatosis can provide significant palliation, with a few exceptions such as in patients with pancreatic or gastric carcinoma, ascites, and poor performance status.\r"

If these data can be extended to the age-matched general population, treatment at a 1% mortality rate for all white men 60 to 74 years of age with a PCa with a Gleason score of 6 or greater could cause between 6190 and 30,951 deaths, in contrast to 7335 deaths expected from the cancer.

In the 1985 follow-up, data were collected from the 173 surviving BC patients who had invasive BC, and from a matched control group of 176 women who were asymptomatic of BC. Fifty-five percent of the BC patients were 5 years past diagnosis and treatment at the time of data collection. The BC patients group as a whole did not differ from the asymptomatic control group on indicators of mental health, social and psychological well-being, or physical functioning. However, the BC group reported a greater number of diagnosed medical conditions that limited their activities, and taking more medications, than the asymptomatic group. Within the BC group, severity and recency of the cancer had strong independent adverse effects on several of the indicators of mental health and physical functioning. Advanced age had the same main effects in both groups: greater number of medications and diagnosed medical conditions that cause limitations in activities, but, in contrast, better mental health and well-being. Age had interactive effects with the recency and with severity of BC: more recent and severe cases of BC appeared to produce particularly serious difficulties in psychological adjustment for younger patients, and particularly serious medical problems and physical difficulties in adjustment for older patients.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the contribution of cardiac beta 2-receptors in the cardiac inotropic and chronotropic responses to a beta 2 agonist, terbutaline was infused (0.2 and 0.4 micrograms/kg/min), alone or after pretreatment with either oral atenolol 50 mg or atropine 0.04 mg/kg i.v. or both in six healthy subjects with a multiple crossover design. Terbutaline 0.2 micrograms/kg/min increased heart rate by 15 +/- 2 beats/min, and this response doubled (to 29 +/- 3 beats/min) when the terbutaline infusion followed atropine pretreatment, whereas atenolol pretreatment had no significant effect. Heart rate increased by 44 +/- 2 beats/min in response to terbutaline 0.4 micrograms/kg/min. This response was not affected by atropine. Pretreatment with atenolol diminished the chronotropic response to the higher dose of terbutaline to 27 +/- 4 beats/min. The inotropic response (i.e., changes in pressure: volume ratio) to terbutaline 0.2 micrograms/kg/min was potentiated by atropine (from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 3.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg/ml), whereas atenolol pretreatment had no effect. At the higher dose of terbutaline, atropine pretreatment had no additional effect, whereas atenolol decreased the rise in pressure: volume ratio from 6.0 +/- 1.4 to 2.6 +/- 1.0 mm Hg/ml. The results with atenolol pretreatment indicate that cardiac beta 1 responses are associated with the higher dose of terbutaline, either through direct beta 1 stimulation or indirectly from presynaptic beta 2 activity. The atropine data show that vagal tone actually increased during the terbutaline infusions, blunting the cardiac effects. The results of the present study support the existence of functional chronotropic, as well as inotropic, beta 2 receptors in the healthy human heart.\r"

To determine whether or not serotonin concentration increases across the coronary bed in patients with severe, limiting angina, we measured central aortic and coronary sinus serotonin concentrations by a sensitive radioenzymatic assay in 39 patients with coronary artery disease and 13 patients with minimal or no coronary artery lesions as detected by arteriography. Although no difference existed in the mean aortic or coronary sinus serotonin concentrations between these two groups, elevated coronary sinus serotonin concentrations were detected in 23% of those with coronary artery disease. The coronary sinus and aortic serotonin concentration difference was greater in patients with significant coronary artery disease (0.6 +/- 6.62 ng/ml) compared with patients without significant coronary artery disease (-5.6 +/- 10.32 ng/ml) (mean +/- SD) (p less than 0.05). Further analysis revealed that patients with eccentric, irregular coronary artery lesions or intraluminal filling defects had a significantly elevated coronary sinus and aortic serotonin difference (3.1 +/- 5.54 ng/ml) compared with those with smooth concentric lesions (-1.9 +/- 6.61 ng/ml) (p less than 0.02). These data suggest that serotonin is released into the coronary circulation of some patients with coronary artery disease, especially those with frequent angina and complex coronary lesions. Although serotonin may be released in some patients with coronary artery disease, the specific pathophysiologic role of serotonin in the development or perpetuation of certain coronary syndromes in humans remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if oxygen free radical scavengers administered before coronary artery reperfusion can limit reperfusion arrhythmias, increase the return of regional function in ischemic myocardium, and reduce tissue necrosis at 1 week after 90-minute coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion, conscious dogs were treated with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase before and for 1 hour after coronary artery reperfusion. Another group was treated with recombinant SOD (rSOD) because the commercially available SOD and catalase contained endotoxin. The conscious dogs were studied 3-4 weeks after implanting left ventricular pressure gauges, ultrasonic wall thickness gauges in the posterior left ventricular wall, left atrial catheters, and arterial catheters, Doppler flow transducers, and hydraulic occluders on the left circumflex coronary artery. The only beneficial effect observed was that the number of arrhythmic beats per minute in the rSOD-treated group was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) when compared with a control group after coronary artery reperfusion. Treatment neither increased the amount of recovery of wall thickening in the ischemic zone nor reduced infarct size when expressed either as a percentage of the area at risk or as a function of collateral blood flow in the ischemic zone. For example, infarct size as a percentage of the area at risk was 32.6 +/- 5.8%, 37.4 +/- 6.4%, 28.3 +/- 5.1% in the control, SOD and catalase-, and rSOD-treated groups, respectively. Thus, although treatment with oxygen free radical scavengers invoked a transient reduction in the number of reperfusion arrhythmias, this treatment in conscious dogs failed to improve regional myocardial dysfunction or reduce the amount of necrosis when compared with a control group. The lack of a sustained salutary effect may indicate that longer periods of treatment with free radical scavengers are required in chronic preparations.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of the present study was to demonstrate that intracoronary platelet deposition may trigger intense vasoconstriction of large epicardial coronary arteries in vivo and that this is largely mediated by thromboxane A2 and serotonin released by activated platelets. Cyclic flow variations (progressive declines in blood flow followed by sudden restorations of flow) due to recurrent intracoronary platelet activation and thrombus formation were induced by damaging the endothelium and placing a cylindrical constrictor on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) in open-chest, anesthetized dogs. Coronary diameters were measured in vivo by means of ultrasonic crystals sutured on the LAD immediately distal to the constrictor (LAD1) and 1 cm below (LAD2) and on the circumflex coronary artery (Cx). Coronary artery diastolic diameters were measured continuously before and during cyclic flow variations and after they were abolished by administration of LY53857, a serotonin-receptor antagonist (group 1, n = 7), or SQ29548, a thromboxane-receptor antagonist (group 2, n = 7). During cyclic flow variations, at the nadir of coronary flow, LAD1 (a site of maximal platelet accumulation) cross-sectional area decreased by 52 +/- 10% and 38 +/- 6% in group 1 and 2 animals, respectively (p less than 0.001 compared with values recorded during a brief LAD occlusion obtained by a suture snare), whereas LAD2 (a site of minimal or no platelet accumulation) cross-sectional area did not differ from that recorded during the brief LAD occlusion. SQ29548 abolished cyclic flow variations in seven of seven dogs and LY53857 in six of seven, but they affected the increased coronary vasoconstriction differently: LAD1 cross-sectional area increased by 32 +/- 6% of the control value in SQ29548-treated animals, whereas it returned to baseline dimension values in the LY53857-treated group as these interventions also abolished the cyclic flow variations. We conclude that a marked coronary vasoconstriction may be triggered by local platelet deposition and that thromboxane A2 and serotonin are mediators of this vasoconstriction.\r"

  ".W": "Although in situ end-systolic pressure-volume relations (ESPVRs) are approximately linear throughout a limited load range, they often yield seemingly \"negative\" volume axis intercepts (V0) and V0 shifts with inotropic interventions. We tested whether or not these findings could stem from in situ ESPVR nonlinearity, and we examined the physiologic meaning and limitations of linearized ESPVR variables frequently used for assessing contractile state. Continuous left ventricular pressures and volumes were obtained by micromanometer and conductance (volume) catheters in six open-chest dogs. Left ventricular loading was varied throughout a wide range by rapid left atrial hemorrhage into a reservoir. Propranolol and verapamil were administered to reduce inotropic state, with heart rate maintained by atrioventricular sequential pacing. ESPVRs were fit to nonlinear [Pes = a(Ves-V'0)2 + b(Ves-V'0)] and linear (Pes = Ees (Ves-V0)] models. Contractile state was assessed by the slope of the ESPVR at V'0 (b, of nonlinear model) and by two other ESPVR model-independent measures: the slope of the dP/dtmax and end-diastolic volume relation, and the slope of the stroke work and end-diastolic volume relation. ESPVR was frequently curvilinear, and a significant correlation existed between the extent of nonlinearity (a) and contractile state. Volume intercepts derived from linear fits to the high load ESPVR range were mostly negative and were dependent on changes in Ees. V0 estimates derived from the low load portion were positive and relatively insensitive to Ees. Thus, in situ ESPVR displays contractility-dependent curvilinearity. The contractility range throughout which ESPVRs are essentially linear is typical for isolated hearts, but the range represents low values for in situ ventricles. Despite curvilinearity, Ees determined in situ throughout limited load ranges can accurately assess inotropic state; however, comparisons between ESPVRs should consider potential nonlinearity, and if possible, they should be made within similar end-systolic pressure ranges.\r"

Twenty-four contrast echocardiographic injections were performed in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs either into left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery or into the aortic root. Two-dimensional echocardiography in short-axis view was performed and was digitized off-line into a 256 x 256 pixel matrix with 256 gray levels/pixel. All end-diastolic and end-systolic frames before and to peak contrast were analyzed. A region of interest corresponding to the most intensely opacified myocardial segment was traced, the mean videodensity measured, and the frame of initial contrast appearance detected. The region of interest was divided into three equal parallel layers corresponding to the endocardial, midcardial, and epicardial myocardium. When the echocardiographic contrast effect initially appeared in diastole, the increment in videodensity was greater for the endocardium (131 +/- 48%) than for the epicardium (71 +/- 37% of the increment in videodensity of the entire wall) (p less than 0.05). This inhomogeneity subsequently disappeared in the following end-systolic frame. When the initial echocardiographic contrast effect appeared in systole, intensity was higher in epicardium (136 +/- 83%) than in endocardium (60 +/- 60%) (p less than 0.05). However, in the following diastole, intensity was not significantly different for the two layers. Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography demonstrates that coronary blood flow is primarily subendocardial in distribution during diastole and subepicardial during systole.\r"

Therefore, we studied the effect of N-acetylcysteine on nitrate responsiveness of epicardial arteries and of the venous system (assessed as changes in effective vascular compliance) in dogs (n = 12) during long-term nitroglycerin treatment (1.5 micrograms/kg/min i.v. for 5-6 days). In dogs with nitroglycerin-specific tolerance (shift of venous or epicardial artery dilation to 15-17-fold higher dosages), N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg i.v.) had no dilator effect and did not alter the dose-response relations of nitroglycerin. Yet, in nontolerant dogs (n = 17), N-acetylcysteine augmented (1.5-2.0-fold) the dilation of epicardial arteries and the reduction of peripheral vascular resistance induced by 0.5-1.5 micrograms/kg/min nitroglycerin. In vitro, the augmentation of purified guanylate cyclase activity by nitroglycerin (10-100 microM) was potentiated by N-acetylcysteine (0.01-1.0 mM) in saline or in canine plasma, but N-acetylcysteine alone was ineffective. We conclude that 1) N-acetylcysteine does not restore nitroglycerin responsiveness in tolerant epicardial arteries or veins in vivo, 2) a small, tolerance-independent augmentation of nitroglycerin-induced dilation may result from N-acetylcysteine-induced extracellular formation of a stimulant of guanylate cyclase from nitroglycerin.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of smoking, aspirin ingestion, and sex differences on bleeding times and bleeding time thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin (PG)F1 alpha production were examined. Nonsmoking men produced more thromboxane B2 (3.99 +/- 0.76 ng/ml) than nonsmoking women (2.13 +/- 0.24 ng/ml). Female smokers produced more thromboxane B2 (5.01 +/- 0.97 ng/ml) than nonsmoking women. Twenty-four hours after a single dose of 600 mg aspirin, in vitro production of thromboxane B2 in response to collagen fell by 95%, whereas in vivo production of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in bleeding time blood fell by 87% and 66%, respectively. Subjects with the lowest absolute levels of thromboxane B2 24 hours after aspirin were also those with the longest postaspirin bleeding times. Recovery of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production was faster than recovery of thromboxane B2 production, but 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production for most subjects was still below basal 72 hours after aspirin. The influence of two different doses of long-term aspirin (80 mg every other day and 325 mg daily) on the in vivo production of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was studied in normals and diabetics. After 14 days of 80 mg aspirin every other day, thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production were both substantially inhibited (93% and 78%, respectively). After 14 days of 325 mg aspirin daily, thromboxane B2 production was similarly substantially inhibited (93%), whereas 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was significantly less affected (only 45% inhibition). Study of a second group of five normal subjects confirmed that 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production was significantly inhibited 24 hours after the first dose of 325 mg aspirin but was not significantly less than basal after 14 days of 325 mg aspirin. The results suggest that 325 mg aspirin daily is more antithrombotic compared with 80 mg every other day due to the superior preservation of prostacyclin production.\r"

There was a significant correlation between the percent change in QRS duration at the shorter paced cycle length and the percent change in VT cycle length (r = 0.84, p less than 0.001) with the relation expressed by the regression equation: percent change in VT cycle length = -2.8 + 1.16 x percent change in QRS duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Arterial baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch regions reflexly regulate heart rate and peripheral vascular responses during changes in arterial pressure. The relative influence of these two arterial baroreflex pathways on the control of these autonomic responses is debatable. Recent studies in our laboratory demonstrate that the aortic baroreflex produces substantial and sustained inhibition of efferent sympathetic nerve activity to muscle (MSNA) during increases in arterial pressure. The regulation of MSNA by these two baroreflexes in humans during hypotension, and particularly the role of the aortic baroreflex, remains undefined. We therefore performed a new series of studies to assess the relative influence of the aortic and carotid baroreflexes on MSNA responses during sustained decreases in arterial pressure. In eight normal male subjects, aged 23 +/- 1 years (mean +/- SEM), we directly measured mean arterial pressure, heart rate, central venous pressure, and MSNA (microneurography) during hypotension (combined aortic and carotid baroreceptor deactivation) produced by intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside and during nitroprusside infusion with superimposed application of external neck suction. Neck suction was applied at levels sufficient to maintain transmural carotid sinus pressure above control levels (carotid baroreceptor activation) while the aortic baroreflexes remained deactivated. Central venous pressure was maintained constant with volume infusion. We also studied responses of these same subjects to direct carotid baroreceptor deactivation with the application of external neck pressure. During neck pressure alone, there was a reflex increase in mean arterial pressure; thus, during this portion of the protocol, we achieved carotid baroreceptor deactivation with some aortic baroreceptor activation. Nitroprusside infusion (combined aortic and carotid deactivation) decreased mean arterial pressure from 90.8 +/- 3.1 to 77.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) with concomitant increases in heart rate from 62.6 +/- 3.0 to 89.7 +/- 6.1 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and in MSNA from 273.8 +/- 43.0 to 950.6 +/- 133.5 units (p less than 0.001). During continued nitroprusside infusion with superimposed neck suction (aortic baroreceptor deactivation and carotid baroreceptor activation), mean arterial pressure decreased to 70.3 +/- 1.9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001 vs. control), heart rate decreased to 82.5 +/- 6.5 beats/min (p less than 0.01 vs. control or vs. nitroprusside alone), but MSNA remained markedly increased at 889.7 +/- 105.1 units (p less than 0.001 vs. control; p = NS vs. nitroprusside alone).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Recent studies in animals have identified flow-mediated and neurogenic changes in large artery diameter. This study tested for flow-mediated dilatation and reflex constriction of the brachial artery in humans. A dual-crystal pulsed Doppler system was used to measure brachial artery diameter and blood flow proximal to the antecubital fossa. To test for flow-mediated dilatation, flow through the brachial artery was altered by an occluding cuff placed on the forearm distal to the site of brachial artery flow and diameter measurement. Control blood flow was 123 +/- 20 ml/min, and brachial artery diameter was 4.74 +/- 0.17 mm (mean +/- SEM). By inflating the distal occluding cuff (distal circulatory arrest), flow was reduced through the brachial artery to 21 +/- 5 ml/min (p less than 0.005), and brachial artery diameter was reduced to 4.35 +/- 0.20 mm (p less than 0.001). By deflating the distal occluding cuff after 10 minutes (reactive hyperemia), brachial artery flow was increased to 358 +/- 55 ml/min (p less than 0.001), and diameter was increased to 5.6 +/- 0.19 mm (p less than 0.001). These interventions did not change systemic arterial pressure and, as measured in three subjects, caused only small changes in local brachial artery distending pressure. Thus, both increased and decreased brachial artery blood flow produced significant changes in brachial artery diameter without altering arterial distending pressure. These data provide evidence for flow-mediated dilatation in humans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Under local anesthetic and Valium (Roche, Nutley, New Jersey) sedation, 20 patients with sciatica, restricted straight-leg raising, and neurological impairment were treated by this simple and safe technique. All patients had computed tomographic evidence of L4-L5 protrusion. The introduction of a sheath with an internal diameter of 4.9 mm permitted removal of the nuclear material by means of a small pituitary forcep. Using the self-assessment method of Coventry and Stauffer, it was concluded that 12 of the 20 patients had a good or fair result. Predictably, the compensation patients fared poorly. There were no complications. This technique appears applicable in HLD to properly selected patients, and it would seem that it is safe, effective, and cost efficient.\r"

Using the devised two parameters, i.e., the shoulder center edge and glenoid angles, the author compared the glenohumeral movements of the normal shoulder with the involuntary inferior and multidirectional instability of the shoulder. The glenohumeral movements of the involuntary inferior and multidirectional instability showed not only an excessive excursion and sliding motion but also a deterioration of the scapular abduction and external rotation, with the arm progressively abducted. These phenomena were especially remarkable at the maximum elevation of the arm. The roentgenogram of the overhead view of the shoulder joint indicates whether or not there is an involuntary inferior and multidirectional instability, and whether or not these parameters can be useful for diagnosis of shoulder lesions.\r"

  ".W": "The results were retrospectively analyzed of 47 subtrochanteric fractures of the femur treated with a 95 degrees condylar blade-plate to establish whether two different surgical techniques yielded different results. Before 1981, treatment consisted of extensive visualization of the fracture lines, permitting anatomic reduction of all fragments, stable internal fixation with the blade-plate, and optional autologous bone grafting as recommended by the AO group. Twenty-four fractures were treated accordingly and constituted Group I of this study. In 1981, visualization of the fracture lines was abandoned, especially at the medial cortex; an indirect reduction technique was used to gain optimal alignment and stability without aiming at anatomic reduction, and bone grafting was discontinued. Twenty-three patients were treated accordingly and constituted Group II. The use of prophylactic antibiotics as a routine for all major trauma was instituted at the time the surgical technique was changed. Thus, only two of the 24 patients in Group I received antibiotics as opposed to 20 of the 23 patients in Group II. Average time to bony union for those fractures that healed primarily was 5.4 months in Group I and 4.2 months in Group II. Delayed or nonunion was 16.6% in Group I and 0% in Group II, and the infection rate was 20.8% versus 0% in the two groups. The four cases with a delayed union were aseptic, but three of the four nonunions were infected. The functional end result was comparable for both groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The fracture incidence rate per 100,000 individuals in the population at risk was calculated. Hip fracture prevailed in women with a sex ratio of women to men of 3.81; in both sexes the incidence was more closely related to age than any other factor. The incidence rate of fracture increased significantly in women during the period from 1975 to 1985, whereas there was no significant increase in men during this time. This change may be related to the continuing trend toward a greater proportion of elderly women in the population. The incidence rate in men showed a long-cycle periodic behavior correlated with the long-cycle trend of cloud cover and rainfall; it is possible that precipitation and a greater occurrence of femoral fractures might be interrelated in men. This parallelism was not evident in women. In women the rise in fracture rate was not continuous but decreased periodically. The zeniths of fracture incidence were preceded two years by a decrease in temperature and an increase in cloud cover and rainfall, suggesting a possible relationship between fractures and the diminution of ultraviolet radiation.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-eight knees in 34 patients with an average age of 22 years were diagnosed as having lateral facet syndrome (LFS), a painful compressive arthropathy of the lateral facet of the patella. This diagnosis was based on the physical findings of tenderness at the lateral patellofemoral joint line, tenderness over the vastus lateralis obliquus (VLO) tendon just above the patella, a positive medial apprehension test, and marked resistance to medial patellar displacement with the knee flexed 30 degrees. The most common complaints were patellar pain with activity, pain with prolonged knee flexion, intermittent knee swelling, and giving way. At surgery, the VLO, the lateral retinaculum (LR), and the anterior fibers of the iliotibial tract (ITT) were sequentially divided from the lateral border of the patella. Each was temporarily reattached to a cuff of soft tissue left on the patella using surgical clamps to determine its contribution to lateral restraint. The VLO was found to be the primary restraint in one-half of the knees. In one-third of the knees, all three of the structures contributed equally. In six knees, the primary restraint was the anterior fibers of the ITT, whereas the LR was the primary restraint in only two. The distal ends of these three structures were then resected to prevent rescarring and retethering. At a minimum follow-up period of two years, 87% had satisfactory relief of their patellar pain, had returned to normal activities, and had no or minimal physical findings of LFS. The procedure is recommended for patients who have failed other procedures and in those whose symptoms cannot be controlled by activity modification, exercises, bracing, or medication.\r"

Thirteen knees (13%) had a radiolucency with a width of 2 mm or more beneath one or more of three tibial zones. In only one case did this represent a clinical loosening. Six knees (6%) had complications requiring reoperation. One deep infection was treated with an arthrodesis, one patellar button was revised after a traumatic patellar fracture, and three superficial skin necroses were surgically managed. Moreover, in one mechanically loosened tibial component, a revision has been planned. No complications were fatal. The modified total condylar I prosthesis is an excellent prosthetic design with a low failure rate in gonarthrosis.\r"

Maximum knee extension and flexion torques were also determined. The greatest improvement in gait was noted in the first three postoperative months when velocity increased 13% and stride length increased 14%. After six months gait changes were negligible. Maximum knee torques in the osteoarthritic population were decreased at three months, then returned to preoperative levels at six months. In the rheumatoid population, maximum knee torques steadily increased up to six months following surgery. Gait abnormalities that persist at six months and beyond following knee arthroplasty appear to be most related to the presence of arthritis in joints other than in the operated knee(s).\r"

  ".W": "Using a series of miniature piezoelectric transducers constructed by the authors, a study was made of the effect of anterior displacement of the tuberosity of the tibia on the distribution of pressures in the patellofemoral joint. Proportionally, the most efficient displacements are those set at 1 cm; after this, and as advancement of the tuberosity is increased, the overall pressure continues to decrease progressively (although more slowly) because there are zones that, according to their situation, receive increased instead of decreased pressures. Consequently, values even higher than those of the original situation are reached. This is the case of the proximal part of the patella, particularly on its lateral facet. This situation can affect the results in cases where the lesion is preferentially located on the proximal part. In these cases it may be enough to advance 1 cm with which overall decompressions close to 50% of the pressure that initially affected the patellofemoral joint are obtained. In very evolved cases or when the lesions are located centrally or distally, it may be worthwhile to advance maximally in spite of the possible complications, seeking the greatest decompression effect that intense advancements can achieve.\r"

In a prospective study 102 patients with displaced unimalleolar or bimalleolar fractures of the ankle were managed using internal fixation devices consisting of cylindrical biodegradable implants 3.2 or 4.5 mm in diameter and 50 or 70 mm in length. After open reduction of the fracture a channel was drilled from the tip of the malleolus into the cancellous bone through the fracture surfaces. A biodegradable rod of the same diameter was then tapped into the drill channel to fix the fracture. Postoperatively, the ankle was immobilized by a plaster cast for six weeks. An anatomic initial reduction was achieved in 93 patients (91%). A slight secondary displacement occurred in four patients. In six patients a sinus formation yielding remnants of the degrading implant was seen two to four months after the operation. This minor complication did not influence the union of the fracture or functional recovery. At the one-year follow-up examination there was no change in the ability to participate in sports and other physical activities in 89 patients (87%). The biodegradable fixation method is now the routine approach of the department in treating displaced unimalleolar and bimalleolar ankle fractures. New clinical applications for the implants are under trial.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective study, 100 patients with 102 herniations of the nucleus pulposus at L2-L3, L3-L4, L4-L5, and L5-S1 and unremitting radicular pain were treated by percutaneous lumbar discectomy. Ninety-three patients were available for follow-up examination. Three patients had died, and four patients could not be located for this review, but all had been followed for more than one year postoperatively and were judged to have had an excellent result at the time of the last follow-up examination. Fifty-nine patients have been followed for longer than two years postoperatively, with a maximum follow-up period of six years. Evaluations were based on modified MacNab criteria and patient interview, questionnaire, and examination. Eighty-one patients (87%) were judged to be successes, since they were pain-free and had returned to gainful employment and their preinjury activity levels. Twelve patients' operations (13%) were judged to be failures and required repeat surgical procedures at the level of the presenting pathologic condition. Three patients (not included in the follow-up group) died of unrelated causes; they had been followed for a minimum of 15 months postoperatively and were previously judged to have had an excellent result. No major complications, including superficial or deep infections, discitis, or neurovascular compromise, were encountered. Meticulous selection of patients for percutaneous lumbar discectomy is the key to success with the method.\r"

In both cases, accidental overheating and hemolysis of the transfused blood caused a gross hemoglobinuria. Because the etiology of the hemolysis was not readily apparent at the time, both patients were managed as though they had had an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. Because there was no activation of the complement cascade by antigen-antibody complexes, both patients suffered no ill effects. Differentiation of extracorporeal hemolysis from hemolytic transfusion reactions requires a careful inspection of all blood administration equipment, as well as an analysis of the untransfused blood in both bag and tubing. Patients undergoing orthopedic procedures account for 15% of all blood transfused in the United States. Awareness of adverse effects of transfusion is therefore important to orthopedic surgeons.\r"

  ".W": "Successful placement of the distal interlocking screws into the Grosse-Kempf nail is a demanding procedure due in part to deformation of the nail during insertion and to inaccuracy of the targeting device supplied with the system. The authors suggest an alternative approach. After placement of the nail in a tibia or femur, a Kirschner wire (K-wire) is directed through the distal transfixation hole under fluoroscopic control. A second Grosse-Kempf nail is placed alongside the limb with the K-wire passing through the corresponding distal hole. The more proximal hole on the nail serves as a targeting guide for a more proximal wire. Once correct placement of the wires is confirmed roentgenographically, the near cortex is opened with a cannulated drill passed over the wires. The wires are removed, the opposite cortices are drilled, and the screws are placed. In 25 consecutive distally locked nailings (eight tibiae and 17 femora), the technique was easily mastered, decreasing the roentgenogram exposure when compared to freehand techniques.\r"

  ".U": "89090303\r", 
  ".W": "To evaluate the optimum conditions for osteogenesis during limb lengthening and to study the changes in soft tissues undergoing elongation, a series of experiments were performed on the canine tibia. The experiments used the transfixion-wire, Ilizarov circular external skeletal fixator in configurations of differing stability of fixation in combination with a second variable, i.e., preservation of the periosteum, bone marrow, and medullary blood supply. Both increased fixator stability, and maximum preservation of the periosseous and intraosseous soft tissues enhanced bone formation during limb lengthening. To assess the role that the direction of the elongation vector plays in osteogenesis, canine tibiae were widened rather than lengthened in a second series of experiments using an Ilizarov apparatus modified for lateral distraction. The new bone formed parallel to the tension vector even when perpendicular to the bone's mechanical axis. As in longitudinal lengthening, damage to the bone marrow inhibits osteogenesis occurring by the influence of a lateral tension-stress vector. In a third series of experiments, half- and full-circumference cortical defects were created in canine tibiae to study the osteogenic potential of the marrow. New bone formed rapidly, even when the marrow was separated from the surrounding periosseous soft tissues by a sheet of polyvinyl chloride, attesting to the importance of marrow element preservation during osteotomy for limb lengthening.\r"

The roentgenographic features were typical of intracortical fibrous dysplasia (osteofibrous dysplasia). These entities are not two distinct diseases, but rather are different histologic expressions of essentially the same process, which varies depending on location (predominantly intracortical or medullary) and age. Adamantinoma in children under ten years of age is not as rare as reported in the literature and was found in two of 14 cases in our files (14.3%). In some cases the fibrous dysplasialike component predominates over the scarce epithelioid islands of tumor cells and consequently is not recognized as adamantinoma. That may explain the frequent recurrences after incomplete excisions of supposed intracortical fibrous dysplasia lesions in young children. An extensive histopathologic study of the biopsy and/or surgical specimen by a specialized pathologist is therefore advisable.\r"

Reported for the first time in the English literature is the use of this technique for preoperative devascularization of metastatic lesions to the spine in eight patients. Effective devascularization was achieved in all peripheral lesions. Blood loss for peripheral lesions averaged 940 cc and compared favorably to 20 nonembolized cases, in whom average blood loss was 1975 cc. Spinal embolization requires careful identification and preservation of any segmental arteries that supply the anterior spinal artery. Effective spinal devascularization was achieved in six of eight patients. In two patients significant bleeding occurred as a result of incomplete embolization. This series supports the growing evidence for the efficacy and safety of selective arterial embolization in the preoperative control of hemostasis in patients with metastatic hypernephroma. Embolization of spinal metastases, although technically demanding, has been effective in devascularizing these lesions without serious neurologic complications.\r"

In 1979 the present authors adopted this method for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation and modified Hijikata's original instruments. Since 1982 additional intradiscal optical control has been included by means of an adapted arthroscopic kit for more accurate and effective removal of the nucleus pulposus under direct view. This procedure is called discoscopy. Between 1979 and late 1987, the method was applied to 109 patients with lumbar disc herniation. The indications included lumbar sciatica that (1) was resistant to conservative treatment and (2) in which myelography and/or examination by computed tomography proved a disc protrusion without dislocation in the spinal canal. The level most affected was L4-L5. Major operative complications encountered were one vascular lesion and two cases of secondary spondylodiscitis. Clinical results in patients with other additional causes of sciatica, such as spondylolisthesis or relapse of disc herniation, were nearly as favorable as in isolated first-time disc herniation. The overall success rate was 72.5% (79/109 patients).\r"

The only contraindication to the procedure is the presence of an extruded fragment. There were ten male and seven female patients, with an average age of 40 years. The operation was performed under local anesthesia and by the method of Hijikata. Six cases were at L5-S1, nine at L4-L5, four at L3-L4, and one at L2-L3. Fourteen of 16 patients were relieved of their symptoms. One operation was aborted due to the inability to pass the cannula beneath arthritic facet joints. One complication occurred early while using general anesthetic. An L5 nerve root was injured, causing a permanent drop foot. Major possible complications include infection, nerve root injury, and vascular injury. The success rate with an average follow-up period of six and one-half months was 87.5%.\r"

The cannula bends the flexible aspiration probe back into the plane of the disc so that it is no longer obstructed by the sacral end plate. Using this system, the L5-S1 disc space was successfully removed in 90% of 30 cases.\r"

Although results have thus far been less successful than previously reported, with improved patient selection by means of routine magnetic resonance imaging (or computed tomographic discography in select cases), success rates (nine of 17 patients) might approach those achieved by chemonucleolysis. The successful response of four patients with so-called midline L4-L5 discs has been particularly encouraging, and it may be that percutaneous lumbar discectomy will be an effective and a reasonable treatment alternative for this particular subgroup of patients.\r"

However, the results of conventional or extensive operations have not always been satisfying. In 1975, the author developed the technique of percutaneous nucleotomy in an effort to avoid the major surgeries then employed. Fenestration of the annulus and partial resection of the nuclear substance are achieved percutaneously by a posterolateral approach. Intradiscal pressure is reduced considerably, and relief of irritation of the nerve root or the pain receptors around the disc is obtained. The extraction of the herniated portion of the disc is not achieved by the procedure. However, the amount of herniated disc substance may be reduced by disc decompression with suction. The procedure can be done in a radiology department under local anesthesia and requires 30 to 60 minutes. Of 136 cases followed, 72% of the patients are satisfied. The concept and theoretical considerations, surgical instruments, details of improved technique, results, and complications of percutaneous nucleotomy are introduced and compared with the original technique.\r"

The best clinical results were in those patients who felt improvement and relief of pain in the leg at the time of the removal of the disc material. The best clinical results were in patients with a major bulge of the disc and decompression of the nerve root. Patients with sequestration of the disc do not uniformly respond well to this procedure. There were no significant complications. Percutaneous excision of herniated L4-L5 lumbar discs, under local anesthesia, is a safe and valid procedure to reduce patient morbidity and hospital stay, and it does not prejudice the outcome of a formal laminectomy if it should fail.\r"

The population tended to be single (77%), black (66%), poorly educated (63% less than a high school education), and young (mean age 21.8 years). Thirty-six percent were primiparas. The decision to breastfeed was associated with white race, older maternal age, higher educational level, marriage, and earlier utilization of prenatal care. Prenatal infant feeding plans were compared with actual postpartum decisions for 1,168 women. Only 3 percent of those initially planning to bottle feed changed their minds postpartum and breastfed although 31 percent of those initially planning to nurse ultimately chose artificial feeding. Ten percent of women were initially undecided; one-third of this group ultimately breastfed, two-thirds bottle fed. Overall the percentage of women in the project who were breastfeeding rose from 15 percent to 22 percent from the early to later years of the project (p less than 0.0001).\r"

Endocrinological examinations confirmed the diagnosis of central precocious puberty. Pathologic findings after the removal of the cystic lesions revealed that the large cyst was derived from degenerated follicular cysts and the small cysts were identical to follicular cysts: all were considered to have been formed by gonadotropin stimulation. In general, surgical removal of an ovarian follicular cyst in central precocious puberty is inappropriate. However, in this unusual patient who had a degenerated large cyst, surgery seemed to be appropriate because of a previously removed teratoma in the contralateral ovary.\r"

In myometrial membranes about 80% to 85% of the beta-adrenoceptors were of the beta 2-subtype. The density of myometrial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors in women treated with the beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist hexoprenaline to prevent preterm labor was about 65% to 70% lower than that in nontreated women. Concomitantly, in hexoprenaline-treated women the 10 mumol/L isoproterenol-evoked increase in lymphocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate content (as index for lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor responsiveness) was diminished to a similar extent. Combining all data resulted in a significant positive correlation between myometrial and lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptor densities (r = 0.7303; n = 36; p less than 0.001). It is possible that determination of beta-adrenoceptor function in circulating lymphocytes may be a useful model to monitor myometrial beta-adrenoceptor changes during tocolytic therapy.\r"

Subjects received single oral doses of diphenhydramine, 50 mg, and placebo in this double-blind crossover study. Diphenhydramine plasma concentrations and central nervous system actions were assessed for 24 hours after each treatment. Cognitive impairment was assessed with an automobile driving simulator and digit symbol substitution scores, whereas drowsiness was self-assessed on a visual analog scale. Diphenhydramine produced significant feelings of drowsiness for up to 6 hours after the dose, whereas significant mental impairment was apparent for only 2 hours. Despite the difference in duration of these effects, drowsiness and mental impairment have parallel slopes when effects are related to diphenhydramine concentrations. These data suggest that although the apparent diphenhydramine concentration thresholds to produce drowsiness are lower (30.4 to 41.5 ng/ml) than those needed to produce mental impairment (58.2 to 74.4 ng/ml), these effects have profiles consistent with their being manifestations of the same pharmacologic effect.\r"

In the framework of searching for preventive measures of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity, we investigated the influence of dosage regimen on the renal cortical accumulation of gentamicin and netilmicin in humans. Patients with a tumor partly involving one kidney, with normal renal function, and scheduled for nephrectomy received one dose of either gentamicin (4.5 mg/kg) or netilmicin (5 mg/kg) as a single short-term infusion or as 24-hour continuous infusion. Treatment started 24 hours before surgery. Serum aminoglycoside pharmacokinetics were examined during treatment and renal cortical tissue was sampled at the moment of operation for drug determination. The short-term infusion schedule yielded cortical concentrations of 103.2 +/- 36.3 and 137.4 +/- 34.6 micrograms/gm for gentamicin and netilmicin, respectively. Tissue levels after continuous infusion were 158.1 +/- 52.9 and 178.5 +/- 21.8 micrograms/gm for gentamicin and netilmicin, respectively. For each aminoglycoside, a single short-term infusion resulted in significantly lower renal drug levels than did a continuous infusion of the same dose. From the nephrotoxicity point of view, these data support the administration of gentamicin and netilmicin as once-daily injections. This also supports the appropriateness of further studies to determine clinical efficacy of once-a-day dosing for aminoglycosides.\r"

Recently it has been demonstrated that the in vivo metabolism of propafenone is controlled by the debrisoquin/sparteine polymorphism. To elucidate which of the above metabolic reactions is catalyzed by cytochrome P-450db1, the formation of 5-hydroxypropafenone and N-desalkylpropafenone was studied in the microsomal fraction of four human kidney donor livers previously characterized with regard to their ability to hydroxylate the beta-adrenergic antagonist bufuralol. The l'hydroxylation of bufuralol is catalyzed by the P-450db1 responsible for polymorphic debrisoquin/sparteine oxidation. The formation of 5-hydroxypropafenone but not N-desalkylpropafenone was closely related to bufuralol l'hydroxylation. Incubation with LKM1 antibodies, which selectively recognize P-450db1, inhibited 5-hydroxypropafenone formation completely whereas N-dealkylation was unimpaired. Propafenone was a strong competitive inhibitor of bufuralol l'hydroxylation. Thus it can be concluded that 5-hydroxypropafenone is formed by the cytochrome P-450 isozyme involved in polymorphic bufuralol oxidation.\r"

We studied dextromethorphan oxidation in vitro using human liver microsomes to investigate the kinetics of the polymorphic monooxygenase (cytochrome P-450 db1) and factors that may influence its activity. In microsomal preparations from six extensive metabolizers the reaction parameters were: Michaelis-Menten constant = 3.4 +/- SD 1.0 mumol/L and maximum rate of metabolism = 10.2 +/- 5.3 nmol x mg P-1 x hr-1, vs 48 mumol/L and 2.2 nmol x mg P-1 x hr-1, respectively in microsomes prepared from the liver of one poor metabolizer. The reaction was inhibited by nonspecific monooxygenase inhibitors such as SKF 525-A (Ki = 100 nmol/L) and cimetidine (Ki = 40 mumol/L), by known substrates of the polymorphic isozyme such as [+]-bufuralol (Ki = 7.5 mumol/L), debrisoquin (Ki = 25 mumol/L), and sparteine (Ki = 45 mumol/L), and by the selective cytochrome P-450 db1 inhibitor quinidine (Ki = 15 nmol/L).

In a multivariate analysis, SA and bilirubin were significant predictors of Fu (r2 = 0.93; p less than 0.05). This study corroborates previous reports of etoposide PB in normal human serum and demonstrates altered PB in patients with abnormal serum albumin or bilirubin levels.\r"

These were best characterized by a two-compartment ICG model and a four-compartment thiopental model, chiefly because of data obtained from frequent early arterial blood samples. The models had a common central volume (V1), and the peripheral ICG compartment was the subset of a peripheral thiopental compartment. The two-compartment ICG model described its mixing within the intravascular space. The traditional VC of three-compartment models of thiopental disposition is described by the present four-compartment model as an initial distribution volume, V1, codetermined by ICG as central blood volume, and a rapidly equilibrating peripheral volume, V4. The combined simultaneous ICG-thiopental model more clearly reflects physiology than do the results of earlier curve-fitting techniques and may be useful in studying the pharmacokinetic basis of altered reactivity to thiopental.\r"

Six subjects were extensive metabolizers of both debrisoquin and mephenytoin (EM). Four subjects were poor metabolizers of debrisoquin but rapid for mephenytoin (PMD). Five subjects were poor metabolizers of mephenytoin but rapid for debrisoquin (PMM), and one individual had a deficiency for both test compounds (PMD/M). Partial metabolic clearances of each propranolol enantiomer to 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-P), the sulfate, and glucuronide conjugates of 4-OH-P, naphthoxylactic acid (NLA) and propranolol glucuronide, were estimated after a single oral dose of racemic propranolol (80 mg). The partial metabolic clearance of both enantiomers to total 4-OH-P in the PMD group was 75% less than in the EM and PMM groups, indicating the contribution of the debrisoquin isozyme to this route of metabolism. The R/S ratios for the clearance to 4-OH-P were similar between EM and PMD (2.5 +/- 0.5 vs 2.5 +/- 0.4, respectively), implying that the different enzymes involved in ring hydroxylation (i.e., the debrisoquin isozyme and other hydroxylases) have similar stereoselective preferences. The partial metabolic clearance to NLA was 55% less in the PMM group than in the EM and PMD groups, indicating that S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylase contributes to the metabolic conversion of propranolol to NLA. The R/S ratios for the clearance to NLA were close to unity in all groups. The partial metabolic clearance to propranolol glucuronide also did not exhibit stereoselectivity and was similar in all groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), filtration fraction, mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow (RBF), and renal vascular resistance (RVR) were determined each time. Plasma volume (PV) was determined at baseline and after oral enoximone and after oral enoximone plus furosemide. Significant reductions in GFR (18%) and ERPF (20%) were observed after IV treatment but not after oral treatment with or without furosemide. MAP also was lowered significantly by 14% after IV administration but not after oral treatments. PV after oral enoximone plus furosemide was reduced significantly (31%) compared with baseline. These results demonstrate that enoximone produces acute reductions in GFR and ERPF when given intravenously but has no effect on parameters of renal function when given orally, either alone or with furosemide.\r"

Blood samples were collected hourly for 6 hours, every 2 hours from 6 to 12 hours, at 24 hours, and then every 24 hours for 144 hours. At these times an intradermal injection of 0.01 ml of a 0.1 mg/ml histamine phosphate solution was performed, and wheal and flare areas were computed. The serum elimination t1/2 of hydroxyzine was 29.3 +/- 10.1 hours; the volume of distribution was 22.5 +/- 6.3 L/kg; the clearance rate was 9.6 +/- 3.2 ml/min/kg, and the AUC was 1383.1 +/- 1039.0 ng.hr/ml. The mean serum elimination t1/2 of cetirizine, the active metabolite of hydroxyzine generated in vivo, was 24.8 +/- 7.7 hours, not significantly different from that of the parent compound (p = 0.05). After a single dose of hydroxyzine the mean wheal and flare areas were significantly suppressed from 1 to 144 hours, compared with the mean predose wheal and flare sizes (p less than 0.01). Maximum wheal suppression, compared with all other wheals measured during the study, occurred from 4 to 10 hours, inclusive, and maximum flare suppression occurred from 2 to 72 hours, inclusive (p less than 0.01). Hydroxyzine has a long t1/2 and a large volume of distribution in the elderly. The suppressive effect on the wheal and flare after a single dose of hydroxyzine is also extremely prolonged, suggesting the possibility of enhanced H1-receptor activity in old age.\r"

  ".W": "In the present study, the epidemiology of constipation in the United States and an assessment of its impact on national health are presented. This analysis was based on four different surveys, i.e., the National Health Interview Survey, the National Hospital Discharge Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the Vital Statistics of the United States. These surveys have estimated that over 4 million people in the United States have frequent constipation, corresponding to a prevalence of about 2 percent. Constipation was the most common digestive complaint in the United States, outnumbering all other chronic digestive conditions. Cathartics and laxatives were prescribed to 2 to 3 million patients yearly by general and family practitioners or internists. In 92,000 annual hospitalizations, constipation was listed among the discharge diagnoses. About 900 persons die annually from diseases associated with or related to constipation. Constipation was three times more common in women than men. It showed a marked increase after the age of 65 years. It appeared to affect nonwhites 1.3 times more frequently than whites. In addition, constipation was more frequent in people living in the South than elsewhere in the United States, and in people from families with low income or brief education of the head of family than in people from families with high income or a high educational level of their family head. These data suggest that there are other factors involved in the cause of constipation in addition to dietary fiber content and psychogenic influences. The frequent occurrence of constipation and its impact on public health stress the need for further studies devoted to the epidemiology and basic pathophysiology of this condition.\r"

These patients were divided into two groups according to the year of their operation; group A included patients operated upon between 1978 and 1982, and group B patients were operated upon between 1983 and 1987. Comparing these two five-year periods, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of right colon tumors was noted (P less than 0.05). There was no difference in the distribution pattern of the carcinomas according to sex or age between the two groups (P less than 0.1). The shift to the right of large-bowel neoplasms may indicate the need for an alteration of the diagnostic procedures concerning this disease, with more emphasis given to total colonoscopy and or double-contrast barium enema.\r"

The amount of DNA synthesized by the mucosa was used as a marker of time-related events. A total of 75 Sprague-Dawley rats were investigated. Acute stress was considered for rats briefly plunged (psychic stimulus) or swimming for two hours (physical stimulus). Chronic stress was determined when rats were briefly plunged or swam for two hours for periods ranging from one to eight weeks. \"Sham-transported\" rats were used as controls. DNA in the descending colon decreased significantly in rats swimming for two weeks, but increased (even for plunged rats) at four and eight weeks. In the ascending colon, a substantial increase in DNA content was found in rats plunged or swimming for eight weeks. The descending colon appears to be quantitatively more affected by various stressors than the ascending colon. It is apparent that, in control rats, the mucosa of the descending colon differs from the ascending colon. Fluctuations in the colonic DNA synthesis throughout the experiment suggest that this phenomenon may be connected to compensatory mechanisms toward cell adaptation to stress conditions. The model may prove of value in studies of the therapeutic abrogation of the fluctuations of the DNA replication of the colonic mucosa during the acute and chronic phases of a given stress.\r"

Four of the 7 patients were rendered completely continent after secondary operations. Maximum anal pressure and maximum squeeze pressure did not change significantly after surgery; however, preoperative maximum squeeze pressure in patients who achieved complete continence was significantly greater than in those that did not. Poor results usually were associated with severe obstetric trauma.\r"

The blood supply at the different sites of the anal canal are demonstrated by a morphometric study (N = 20). The inferior rectal artery presents two variants in the postmortem angiographies, type 1 (85.4 percent) and type 2 (14.6 percent). In type 1, the posterior commissure is less perfused than the other sections of the anal canal. In addition, the blood supply may be more compromised by contusion of the vessels passing vertically through the muscle fibers of the sphincter ani internus muscle during increased sphincter tone. The role of topography in the pathogenesis of the primary anal fissure is illustrated in a model.\r"

Ten normal epithelia, 36 adenomas (14 with mild atypia, 13 with moderate atypia, and 9 with severe atypia) and 14 carcinomas (well-differentiated adenocarcinoma) were examined with light and electron microscopes. Although it has been generally accepted that malignant transformation of an adenoma gradually proceeds with increasing atypia, using light microscopy, ultrastructural quantitative analysis clearly revealed that fine features of individual atypia did not correspond with histologic grades of atypia. Ultrastructural changes occurred abruptly in moderate atypia and showed similar cellular characteristics to carcinoma cells. Mild atypia was almost similar in appearance to normal epithelial cells. Striking changes in the moderate atypic cells were plane apposition of the cell membrane, decrease of the desmosomes, and increase of the lysosomes. These atypical cells were assumed to play a significant role in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Therefore, radical surgical therapy would be required for moderate atypic adenoma of the large bowel that is difficult to remove endoscopically.\r"

Debridement and primary closure of the perforation, with temporary decompression of the pouch, resulted in a good outcome. With the increasing popularity of selecting restorative proctocolectomy for the treatment of polyposis coli and ulcerative colitis, more and more pouches will be constructed. Possible perforation of the ileal pouch should be considered when such patients present with a perforated hollow viscus. With appropriate management, the pouch can be saved.

Total bacterial concentrations after a PI enema (N = 44) were significantly lower than after a simple water enema (N = 12, P less than 0.001), or than after a water enema associated with intravenous metronidazole (N = 16, P less than 0.01). The study of the colon included 41 patients. Total bacterial concentrations did not differ after a PI enema (N = 24) than after a water enema (N = 11); both groups were associated with intravenous metronidazole. In contrast, both preparations significantly reduced bacterial concentrations when compared with oral administration of polyethyleneglycol (N = 6, P less than 0.01). Similar results were observed in rectal and colonic studies, when analysis was restricted to the anaerobic flora. PI is an antiseptic that, when administered alone in an enema or in association with metronidazole, significantly reduces bacterial concentrations in the mucosa of the colon and rectum. It may be proposed as a simple preoperative preparation for colorectal surgery.\r"

Villous atrophy was total or subtotal, but enterocyte alterations were minimal. Crypts were hyperplastic and the lamina propria was infiltrated by lymphocytes and plasma cells mainly synthesizing IgM. These alterations were associated with the presence in the submucosa, and occasionally in the mucosa, of numerous convoluted nonectasic capillary tufts. Thrombi consisting of pure platelet aggregates were found in the capillary tufts and adjacent small vessels, whose walls were either normal or hyalinized. The patient suffered for many years from attacks of Raynaud's phenomenon and platelet aggregation was depressed in the presence of collagen.

A severe peripheral neuropathy with fiber degeneration in the posterior columns and axonal lesions within ventral nerve roots and a more recent fiber degeneration in the lateral columns corresponding to the picture of subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord and a symmetrical Ammon's horn sclerosis was present.

Although hypotension is expected, endoscopists should be alert to the finding of severe hypertension and consider pheochromocytoma. The need for this becomes even greater considering that primary gastrointestinal endoscopy is often being done in doctor's offices away from hospitals and more acute resuscitative resources.

It usually occurs in the presence of anorectal or rectal carcinoma that metastasizes to the lumbosacral vertebrae (2-4). Hypercalcemia complicating colon carcinoma in the absence of bone metastases--so-called humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or paraneoplastic hypercalcemia--is rare. Only two such cases associated with adenocarcinoma of the colon (5,6) and two cases associated with adenosquamous carcinoma of the distal colon (rectum and sigmoid) (7) have been reported. We describe the first reported case of an adenosquamous carcinoma of the cecum and ascending colon that was accompanied by severe humoral hypercalcemia. The hypercalcemia was associated with a parathyroid hormone (PTH)-like substance.\r"

  ".W": "In 32 patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with a balloon catheter, culture of bile, biliary pressure at maximal visualization of the biliary tract with iodinated contrast medium, serum iodine concentrations, and blood cultures before and after the procedure were obtained. There was a significant increase in the serum iodine concentration in five of nine patients (55.6%) with pressure between 22 cm H2O and 30 cm H2O and in nine of 13 patients (69.2%) with pressure above 30 cm H2O, while it remained low in 10 patients with pressure below 22 cm H2O. Two patients showed positive blood culture after the procedure, which yielded the same organisms as found in the bile. The biliary pressures in these two patients were 30.4 cm H2O and 38.0 cm H2O. These data suggest that during retrograde balloon catheter cholangiography: (1) cholangiovenous reflux of contrast medium develops with biliary pressure higher than 22 cm H2O, (2) the indicence of the cholangiovenous reflux increases as the pressure is elevated, and (3) regurgitation of bacteria occurs with pressure greater than 30 cm H2O. These findings are noteworthy because the number of patients who need direct cholangiography is increasing.\r"

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of NT on human, dog, guinea pig, and rabbit GB in vitro, in order to delineate direct versus indirect actions of NT in different species and to evaluate the structure-activity relationships of NT. The effect of NT on the canine sphincter of Oddi (SOD) was also examined in vitro. Isolated longitudinal strips of GB from the four species given above and SOD from dogs were suspended in oxygenated Krebs buffer, and the isometric tension responses to various doses of NT, NT 8-13, NT 1-11, and xenopsin (XP) were determined. All the NT homologs, except NT 1-11, stimulated contraction of the dog GB and SOD in a dose-dependent manner. NT also caused dose-related stimulation of GB contraction from guinea pigs but did not stimulate or depress the contractile activity of human and rabbit GB strips. These results suggest that NT action on GB contraction is species-specific. Tetrodotoxin did not modify the contraction of dog GB and SOD in response to NT, indicating that NT mediates its contractile effects directly. The relaxing effect of NT on GB of humans in vivo, as previously reported by us, thus appears to be an indirect action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A number of metabolic changes within the liver occur concurrent with hepatic regeneration. These processes suggest that the administration of an antiestrogen might alter the rate of hepatic regeneration. To examine this question, male Wistar rats were treated with tamoxifen (0.1 mg/rat/day or 1.0 mg/rat/day) or vehicle for three days prior to and after partial hepatectomy, and the anatomic and biochemical process of hepatic regeneration was assessed. Tamoxifen administration caused a dose-dependent decrease in the hepatic cytosolic estrogen receptor activity and, conversely, a dose-dependent increase in cytosolic androgen receptor activity. Despite these changes in baseline hepatic sex steroid receptor status, all receptor activities were comparable between the three groups within 24 hr of partial hepatectomy. Moreover, no differences in any of the parameters assessing hepatic regeneration following partial hepatectomy were evident: liver-body ratio, ornithine decarboxylase activity, and thymidine kinase activity. This lack of effect of tamoxifen treatment on hepatic regeneration suggests either that estrogens do not play a role in the modulation of liver growth after partial hepatectomy or that, once initiated, the regenerative process per se determines a series of events that regulate hepatocellular sex hormone receptor status independent of extrahepatic stimuli.\r"

The 155 patients with known course of the disease over three years were followed-up further for five more years, and pain evolution was evaluated once at the start and once at the end of the follow-up period. At the time of diagnosis, severe pain (59 vs 33%, P less than 0.001), pancreatic calcification (63 vs 31%, P less than 0.001), advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (72 vs 60%, NS), and overt diabetes (48 vs 17%, P less than 0.001) were more common in alcoholic than in idiopathic pancreatitis, respectively. Pain evolution was similar in both pancreatitis, and the pain decreased with time. The rate of abstinence was higher in groups with pain relief than without in alcoholic pancreatitis. Cumulative mortality rate during the five years was higher in alcoholic than idiopathic pancreatitis (26 vs 10%, P less than 0.01). These results suggest more favorable evolution of the disease can be expected by abstinence from alcohol.\r"

In 34 patients with acute pancreatitis, serum lipase, trypsinogen, and elastase 1 were elevated in all 34, pancreatic isoamylase in 33 (97%) and amylase in 30 (88%). Ten of these acute pancreatitis patients were followed sequentially for seven days: the variations in their serum enzyme levels were parallel, although the lipase, trypsinogen, and particularly the elastase 1 elevations persisted longer than did those of amylase and pancreatic isoamylase. Among the patients with chronic pancreatitis, either in painful relapse (N = 19) or with pancreatic cysts (N = 15), the respective percentages of enzymes elevations were: 79 and 80% for elastase 1, 68 and 67% for trypsinogen, 63 and 73% for pancreatic isoamylase, 58 and 60% for lipase, 53 and 60% for amylase. In the 52 chronic pancreatitis patients studied during clinical remission, serum enzyme behavior varied greatly, and a majority of the assays (60%) were normal; even in the case of severe pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, normal as well as abnormally high and low enzyme values were seen. Highly variable enzyme behavior was also seen in the 40 patients with pancreatic cancer, and elastase I was the most frequently (35%) elevated enzyme in this group as well. Among the patients with abdominal pain of nonpancreatic origin, abnormally high enzyme levels were present in percentages ranging from 6% for lipase to 21% for trypsinogen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred patients underwent both abbreviated (stationary catheter, 10 wet swallows) and extended manometries (stepwise catheter withdrawal, 62 +/- 1 wet swallows). Classification by the two techniques was identical in 83 patients. Abbreviated manometry failed to recognize nine abnormal motility patterns. The abbreviated method was least accurate in the identification of intermittent and focal motility abnormalities (sensitivity = 0.50). Misclassifications were related to catheter position and not solely to differences in the total number of swallows. Of the individual wave parameters measured by each method, detection of multipeaked contraction waves was the most discrepant (R = 0.59). These findings indicate that abbreviated esophageal manometry is reasonably well correlated with a more extended method in detecting esophageal motility disorders and, because of its relative simplicity, appears appropriate for use in clinical practice. Errors related to stationary recording port positions may interfere with the overall accuracy of the abbreviated technique.\r"

Eighty-six patients affected by GER symptoms and 20 healthy volunteers underwent 24-hr home esophageal pH monitoring, x-rays, and endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract to investigate reliability of outpatient recording. Fifteen more patients consecutively underwent out- and inpatient recording to detect possible differences between these methods in the two daily periods. Outpatient monitoring was well tolerated in 94.7% of the patients; 14.3% of them markedly reduced their routine activities. The range of normality of outpatient recording does not differ from that of inpatients. In the 15 patients who consecutively underwent out- and inpatient monitoring, no significant differences were reported. The sensitivity of 24-hr home esophageal pH recording is 0.85, the specificity 1, the accuracy for negative prediction 0.68, and the accuracy for positive prediction 1. The reliability of 24-hr home esophageal pH monitoring is comparable to inpatient recording. It allows hospital cost reduction and is also better tolerated by patients but has not greatly improved the diagnostic accuracy of the gastroesophageal reflux pH monitoring.\r"

The results indicated that the esophageal contraction amplitudes and levels of anxiety-related behaviors of non-cardiac chest pain patients and control subjects were significantly greater during the stressors than during baseline periods. All patients demonstrated significantly greater (P less than 0.01) increases in contraction amplitude and anxiety-related behavior during cognitive problems than during the noise stressor.

A total of 549 patients who underwent 1031 IVF-ET cycles were evaluated. Significant findings were as follows: (1) No differences were found in the number of preovulatory oocytes, fertilization rates, or serum estradiol levels in the follicular phase between any classes of tubo-ovarian disease. (2) Patients with a \"frozen pelvis\" had significantly fewer follicles aspirated than those in any other category, although they had equivalent numbers of preovulatory oocytes retrieved and pregnancy rates. (3) Patients with previous bilateral tubal ligation had higher pregnancy rates than patients with severe tubo-ovarian disease. (4) The type of prior pelvic surgical procedure had no effect on IVF-ET outcome. Although patients with no cause of infertility other than tubal ligation had better results, these patients had previously proven fertility. We conclude that neither the stage of tubo-ovarian disease nor any history of pelvic adhesions or tubal surgery has a significant impact on the efficiency of IVF-ET.\r"

Three of the 27 PZD embryos became blastocysts, while none of the AT-exposed embryos developed satisfactorily. Eleven male-factor couples had some of their oocytes randomly treated with PZD prior to insemination; each of the patients had non-micromanipulated control oocytes. Monospermic fertilization and cleavage (23/34; 68%) doubled (P less than 0.05) when PZD was compared with the control oocytes (10/30; 33%). Replacing two PZD and a single control embryo in two patients resulted in twin pregnancies. A third twin pregnancy was established following replacement of only micromanipulated embryos.\r"

  ".W": "Ovarian follicles sometimes fail to rupture and accumulate large quantities of fluid, yet undergo luteinization and form a steroidogenically competent luteal structure, the luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome. This condition can be mimicked in mammals by administration of indomethacin, an inhibitor of biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Blockade of ovulation by this drug is exerted at the follicular level. Ovulatory failure in sheep given a single intramuscular injection of indomethacin after induction of a surge of of luteinizing hormone was associated with follicular hyperemia as assessed by scanning electron microscopic examination of microcorrosion vascular casts and light microscopic quantification of follicular vascular space. The apical stigma of control (ovulatory) follicles was ischemic. The luteinized unruptured follicle syndrome appears to be the consequence of a chronic follicular inflammatory-like reaction involving inhibition of synthesis of prostaglandins.\r"

The subjective rating of sexual stimulation elicited when I-SCD was used was far superior than with masturbation. It is believed the success of I-SCD is due, in part, to this greater degree of sexual stimulation, presumably by added loading of the vas deferens prior to ejaculation.\r"

Sixty-five patients in whom LPD was diagnosed and corrected, as judged by endometrial biopsies, were studied; 35 were treated with PS and 30 with CC. Using Student's t-tests and chi-square analyses, the two treatment groups were demographically comparable. Using life-table analysis, no one therapeutic approach proved superior.

During a 30-month period, 163 women who had had pelvic pain for at least 3 months had a CA-125 level obtained prior to surgery. Serum CA-125 was measured by an immunoradiometric assay. Of the 82 women with endometriosis, 66 (80%) had CA-125 concentrations greater than or equal to 16 U/ml (95% upper limit). The frequencies of elevated levels in minimal, mild, moderate, and severe endometriosis were 52, 86, 100, and 100%, respectively. Of the 81 women without endometriosis, 5 (6%) had elevated concentrations. With the use of serum CA-125 determinations for the detection of endometriosis, the sensitivity was 80%, the specificity was 94%, and the accuracy was 93% when the prevalence of endometriosis was 50%. The authors conclude that determination of CA-125 levels may assist in the evaluation and treatment of women with chronic pelvic pain.\r"

As a first step, serum proteins were removed with an immunoaffinity gel. Fractionation of the proteins unique to hOF was accomplished with DEAE-cellulose chromatography. One of these proteins was obtained in a highly purified state after gel filtration on G-75 Sephadex. This protein of 54 kDa molecular weight had a pI of 4.5 and contained carbohydrate. We propose that this hOF glycoprotein be designated \"human oviductin I\" (hOV I).\r"

Such persons have been assumed to be at increased risk of having additional, asymptomatic colorectal neoplasms, the removal of which would reduce morbidity and mortality from colorectal cancer. In this prospective study, initial colonoscopy was performed on 544 asymptomatic subjects with past histories of colorectal index lesions ranging from small tubular adenomas to invasive cancers. In 402 subjects whose worst index lesion was an adenoma, the prevalence of neoplasms detected at colonoscopy, above the reach of the rigid sigmoidoscope, increased with age, male sex, black race, and the number and size of their index adenomas. In 142 subjects whose worst index lesion was invasive cancer, colonoscopy findings were marginally related to age and white race. A subgroup of 133 subjects whose worst index lesion was a single, small (less than 10 mm) tubular adenoma and who had no first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer had only a 3% prevalence of advanced colonic neoplasms (tubular adenomas greater than or equal to 10 mm in diameter; tubulovillous, villous, or severely dysplastic adenomas; or invasive cancers) found on colonoscopy--no greater than would be expected in the general population. Subgroups of the remaining 411 subjects, who had advanced or multiple index lesions, had prevalences of advanced neoplasms ranging from 8% to 18%. These findings indicate that for persons whose only risk factor is a single small tubular adenoma, current screening guidelines could be modified to recommend techniques less costly and less invasive than colonoscopy.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have demonstrated that a variety of conditions that result in an increase in food intake lead to an increase in small-intestinal cholesterol synthesis. In the present study, it was determined whether hyperphagia induces an increase in cholesterol synthesis in segments of the small intestine excluded from contact with the food stream and whether this increase would occur in bypassed segments of the proximal or mid-small intestine. In hyperphagic diabetic rats, cholesterol synthesis is increased 91% in the proximal portion of the small intestine excluded from contact with nutrients. In lactating rats, another model of hyperphagia, cholesterol synthesis is increased 2.4-fold in midintestinal segments excluded from contact with the food stream and 2.9-fold in segments of the proximal intestine that have been bypassed. These observations demonstrate that the hyperphagia-induced increase in small-intestinal cholesterol synthesis will occur in portions of the small intestine, even if contact with the food stream is prevented. In addition, this data demonstrated that the mass of the bypassed portion of the small intestine is increased in hyperphagic animals. In diabetic animals, the weight of the bypassed proximal intestine is increased 2.1-fold, whereas in lactating animals the mass is increased 50% in the bypassed midintestine and 74% in the bypassed proximal small intestine. In conclusion, the present study suggests that circulating or neurologic factors, or both, play a role in stimulating intestinal cholesterol synthesis in hyperphagic animals. These findings also suggest that indirect factors play a role in the increase in intestinal mass associated with hyperphagia.\r"

In parallel, the potency of each prostaglandin in inhibiting acid generation in vitro was determined by measuring the inhibition of histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in rabbit parietal cells prepared by enzymatic dispersion and enriched by counterflow elutriation. All seven prostaglandins displaced [3H]PGE2 and inhibited histamine-stimulated [14C]aminopyrine accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. For all tested prostaglandins, the IC50 values were in excellent agreement for both variables measured. It is concluded that (a) a PGE2 receptor is localized on the parietal cell and mediates inhibition of acid formation by all prostaglandins and (b) the different in vitro antisecretory potencies of prostaglandins can be attributed to their different affinities to this PGE2 receptor.\r"

  ".W": "Electrical field stimulation (EFS) was performed on rabbit proximal and distal circular colonic smooth muscle to study the mechanisms of neural control of the colon. Electrical pulses were applied with parallel silver plate electrodes to muscle that had been stretched to Lo. The proximal muscle demonstrated an on-contraction during EFS. In distal muscle, EFS initiated an on-relaxation, followed by an on-contraction and an off-contraction. The time delay for the on-contraction of distal muscle was longer by 2.5 +/- 0.5 s than was the delay in proximal muscle (p less than 0.02). The amplitudes of the on- and off-contraction were dependent on the frequency of the EFS. The on- and off-responses were completely inhibited by 3 x 10(-6) M tetrodotoxin. Atropine inhibited the distal on-contraction at all EFS frequencies and the proximal on-response at EFS frequencies less than 16 Hz. Atropine had a partial inhibitory effect on the distal off-response (approximately 30%). Bombesin and substance P were released during prolonged EFS. Desensitization of the distal colonic muscle to bombesin did not affect the distal off-contraction. However, desensitization of the tissue to substance P and exposure to substance P antagonists inhibited the distal off-contraction. These studies suggest that (a) acetylcholine mediates the on-contraction of the distal circular colonic muscle, and a major part of the on-contraction for the proximal muscle, and (b) substance P is responsible for the off-contraction of the distal muscle.\r"

Larger doses caused a net fluid secretion. At the same nominal infusion rates, peptide histidine valine-42 appeared to be the most potent. In terms of plasma concentrations achieved, however, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide was approximately six times more active than the other two human peptides. If confirmed in humans, these results would suggest that peptide histidine methionine and peptide histidine valine may be as important as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in causing the watery diarrhea seen in the Verner-Morrison syndrome in which plasma levels of all three peptides are raised.\r"

We found that (a) the prevalence of villi with epithelial damage or with intact bleb increased progressively during the first 20 min of ethanol perfusion and then declined gradually; (b) the height of the villus core and the patency of lacteals in the undamaged villi and in those with intact bleb decreased during the first 20 min and then gradually increased; and (c) jejunal albumin loss and the prevalence of villi with carbon labeling increased for the first 30 min, after which the former declined gradually whereas the latter remained at a plateau. These findings suggest that contraction of the villus core and compression of the lymphatics are the primary cause of ethanol-induced epithelial damage, which is accentuated by increased microvascular permeability and consequent protein leakage. The mechanism of recovery of most parameters, in spite of continuous ethanol perfusion, remains to be investigated.\r"

  ".W": "Barrett's esophagus develops as a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux and predisposes patients to the development of dysplasia and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Because light microscopy of dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus shows diminished or absent mucus, we used transmission electron microscopy to compare cytoplasmic organelles required for mucus production in dysplastic and nondysplastic esophageal columnar epithelium. These observations of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and secretory granules were correlated with histologic interpretations and flow cytometric measurements of abnormalities of DNA content. Ultrastructural abnormalities included depletion and alteration of organelles required for mucus biosynthesis. These abnormalities often were accompanied by cells with markedly distended rough endoplasmic reticulum and massive accumulation of cytoplasmic glycogen aggregates. All 9 patients who had Barrett's dysplasia with or without early adenocarcinoma had ultrastructural abnormalities, as did 3 of 8 patients whose biopsy histology was indefinite for dysplasia. Abnormalities measured by flow cytometry correlated well with the presence of these ultrastructural aberrations. All 9 patients with Barrett's dysplasia with or without early adenocarcinoma had abnormalities observed by electron microscopy and aneuploidy or increased G2/tetraploid fractions measured by flow cytometry. Two of the 3 patients whose biopsies were indefinite for dysplasia and who had ultrastructural abnormalities also had aneuploidy or increased G2/tetraploid fractions. Neither ultrastructural nor flow cytometric abnormalities were found in the remaining 5 patients whose biopsies were indefinite for dysplasia, in 19 of 22 patients with Barrett's specialized metaplasia, or in any of the 7 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease without Barrett's specialized metaplasia. Two of the 22 patients with Barrett's specialized metaplasia had distended rough endoplasmic reticulum in rare cells, and one other had an aneuploid cell population. We conclude that neoplastic progression in Barrett's esophagus is associated with abnormalities of cytoplasmic organelles required for mucus production. With few exceptions, these ultrastructural aberrations correspond to the presence of dysplasia or of aneuploidy or increased G2/tetraploid fractions. Electron microscopy and flow cytometery detect abnormalities associated with the development of dysplasia and cancer in Barrett's esophagus that may be biologically significant.\r"

  ".U": "89091928\r", 
  ".W": "The diarrhea of cholera is considered to rely solely on a cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated secretory mechanism. However, both 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2 have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of cholera. In vivo experiments were performed, therefore, in the rat jejunum to investigate the influence of purified cholera toxin on fluid secretion, luminal release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2, and formation of mucosal cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Also the effects of ketanserin, indomethacin, verapamil, and nifedipine on the named parameters were studied. Cholera toxin dose-dependently (0.1-0.5 microgram/ml) and time-dependently (1-5 h) increased mean net fluid secretion with a maximum response at 4 h. It also caused a significant (p less than 0.01) rise in release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2, in addition to formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The dose-response curve for cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion was shifted to the right by indomethacin (10 mg/kg s.c.) and ketanserin (200 micrograms/kg s.c.), none of which caused a change in cholera toxin-induced release of 5-hydroxytryptamine. However, both agents significantly decreased the release of prostaglandin E2. Verapamil (0.2-9.5 micrograms/min i.a.) and nifedipine (0.05-0.5 microgram/min i.a.) dose-dependently reduced cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion. The estimated local concentrations at half-maximal inhibition were 5 x 10(-7) M verapamil and 5 x 10(-8) M nifedipine, respectively. The cholera toxin-induced increase in release of 5-hydroxytryptamine and prostaglandin E2 and formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate was unaffected by verapamil. These results support the concept that cholera toxin-induced fluid secretion in vivo is caused, in part, by release of 5-hydroxytryptamine, which in turn stimulates formation of prostaglandin E2.\r"

  ".W": "To determine if carbohydrates perfused into the ileum affect gastric emptying and circulating levels of gastrointestinal hormones, 18 healthy subjects were intubated with an oroileal tube. A 400-cal (60% carbohydrate, 20% protein, 20% fat) homogenized meal labeled with 111In-DTPA was then infused into the stomach over 10 min. Simultaneously, a test solution of normal saline (n = 6) or 12.5 (n = 4), 25 (n = 4), 50 (n = 2), or 100 (n = 2) mg/min of carbohydrates (75% rice starch, 25% glucose) containing a nonabsorbable marker, polyethylene glycol, was continuously perfused into the terminal ileum at 3 ml/min for 7 h. In one-half of the subjects the perfusate contained an amylase inhibitor (3.3 mg/ml) that reduced starch digestion and carbohydrate absorption. Gastric emptying was measured by a dual-headed gamma-camera. Plasma concentrations of hormones and the amount of carbohydrates passing the ileum were measured every 10 min. The amylase inhibitor significantly reduced the absorption of complex carbohydrates from the terminal ileum (p less than 0.05). Gastric emptying was significantly slowed by ileal perfusion of carbohydrates (p less than 0.01). This effect was enhanced by the amylase inhibitor (p = 0.06). Plasma concentrations of C-peptide, glucagon, motilin, gastrin, and human pancreatic polypeptide were not related to gastric emptying or ileal perfusates, but decreased concentrations of gastric inhibitory polypeptide and neurotensin and increased concentrations of peptide YY were significantly associated (p less than 0.05) with slowing of gastric emptying. Perfusing carbohydrates into the ileum was associated with nausea, abdominal pain, and vomiting, but we could detect no direct relationship between the onset of these symptoms and gastric emptying. Slowing of gastric emptying of a homogenized mixed meal by the entry of complex carbohydrates into the ileum may be partly mediated by peptide YY or nonvagally mediated neural mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "Chronic use of cimetidine and alcohol are commonly associated, but studies on their interactions are the subject of controversy. To investigate this question, a small ethanol dose (0.15 g/kg body wt) was randomly administered on 2 consecutive days either orally or intravenously to 6 normal volunteers, before and after 1 wk of oral administration of 400 mg of cimetidine twice daily. Although cimetidine did not change the areas under the curve of blood ethanol concentrations after intravenous administration, those after oral alcohol intake were twice as large with cimetidine than without. Similar effects were reproduced in rats after intravenous administration of cimetidine (50 mg/kg body wt). In vitro, cimetidine was a noncompetitive inhibitor of gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity at concentrations as low as 0.01 mM, 100-fold lower than those needed to inhibit the hepatic dehydrogenase. These results indicate that gastric alcohol dehydrogenase activity governs, in part, the systemic bioavailability of ethanol. Consequently, systemic effects of alcohol may be exacerbated in patients receiving cimetidine.\r"

  ".U": "89091931\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the mechanism by which repeated administration of indomethacin significantly delays the natural healing of experimental gastric ulcers induced in rats. Gastric ulcers were produced 5 days after injecting 20% acetic acid (0.03 ml) into the submucosal layer of the gastric wall of the antral-oxyntic border. The natural healing of the acetic acid-induced ulcers was extensively delayed by administering indomethacin (1 mg/kg) subcutaneously once daily for 2 or 4 wk. Subcutaneous administration of natural prostaglandin E2 (1 or 3 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 and 4 wk, together with indomethacin, significantly prevented the delay of ulcer healing. Prostaglandin E2 (3 mg/kg) administered twice daily for 2 wk also significantly accelerated the natural healing of the ulcers. A single administration of prostaglandin E2 (1 or 3 mg/kg) significantly reduced histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion for 4 h in acute fistula rats with 1- or 2-wk-old ulcers, treated with or without daily indomethacin (1 mg/kg). Endogenous prostaglandin E2 levels in the gastric mucosa of normal rats were significantly reduced for at least 12 h after a single or repeated administration of indomethacin (1 mg/kg) for 2 or 4 wk. Gastric mucosal prostaglandin E2 levels in rats with ulcers (5 days after acetic acid injection) were also markedly reduced by indomethacin. This reduction significantly reverted toward control levels after administration of exogenous prostaglandin E2 (3 mg/kg). These results suggest that endogenous prostaglandin E2 plays an important role in the healing process of gastric ulcers.\r"

The studies were performed on opossums anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. The pressures in the IAS were recorded using continuously perfused catheters. The IAS responses to PHI analogues, PHI-27, PHM-27, PHI-(14-27)-NH2, PHI-(1-13), to VIP, to rectal balloon distention, sacral nerve stimulation, and local intramural stimulation were evaluated before and after PHI-(14-27)-NH2, PHI tachyphylaxis, and the VIP antagonists [4 Cl-D-Phe6, Leu17] VIP (VIP analogue) and (N-Ac-Tyr1, D-Phe2)-GRF(1-29)-NH2 (growth hormone releasing factor analogue). The inhibitory responses by all of the PHI analogues and VIP were not modified by tetrodotoxin. PHI-(14-27)-NH2 and PHI tachyphylaxis caused significant antagonism of the fall in internal anal sphincter pressure by PHI-27 and PHM-27 without modifying the IAS responses to VIP and rectal balloon distention, sacral nerve stimulation, and local intramural stimulation. On the other hand, VIP and growth hormone releasing factor analogues caused significant antagonism of VIP responses without modifying the responses to PHI-27. We conclude that distinct PHI and VIP receptors are present in the IAS smooth muscle and that PHI may not play a significant role in the IAS relaxation via the rectoanal reflex.\r"

  ".U": "89091934\r", 
  ".W": "The 72-h fecal fat determination is used as the gold standard to document the presence of steatorrhea. Although the Sudan stain for fecal fat is advocated as a sensitive screening test, a quantitative correlation between the 72-h fecal fat quantitation and the fecal Sudan stain is lacking. This study was designed to examine the staining properties of different classes of purified lipids in an experimentally defined artificial matrix, and to elucidate the reasons for the lack of quantitative correlation between these two tests. Our results indicate that the \"neutral fat\" stain without acidification or heating identifies triglyceride; and at an appropriate pH, the \"neutral stain\" also identifies fatty acid. The \"split fat\" stain with acidification and heating identifies both triglyceride and fatty acid. After acidification, fatty acid soaps are converted to the nonionized fatty acid. Thus, fatty acid soaps can be identified indirectly as fat droplets that are stained by the split fat stain. Although cholesterol is stained with Sudan stain after heating, upon cooling, cholesterol forms crystals of anhydrous cholesterol, making its staining pattern distinct. Neither the neutral fat nor the split fat stain can detect phospholipid or cholesteryl ester. The 72-h fecal fat determination is a measure of the total fatty acid content after a specimen is saponified. The resulting fatty acids are derived from a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources, including free fatty acids, soaps of fatty acids, triglycerides, cholesterol esters, and phospholipids. Therefore, the 72-h fecal fat quantitation does not differentiate between the primary sources of the measured fatty acid. It is concluded that the 72-h fecal fat determination is not specific for documenting triglyceride (fat) malabsorption. Until new methods are developed that specifically measure fecal triglyceride and fatty acid, the Sudan stain of fecal fat appears to be a more specific method for detecting the presence of triglyceride and fatty acid in a matrix.\r"

Recordings were made in the rectosigmoid and rectum, 25-30 cm and 10-15 cm from the anal margin, respectively, during two 4-min baselines and in response to stepwise distention of the colon with an air-filled balloon. During baseline, the motility (activity index, defined as cumulated areas of all waves divided by recording time) of the rectosigmoid was similar in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (0.38 +/- 0.61 in baseline 1, 0.86 +/- 1.33 in baseline 2) and controls (1.15 +/- 2.02 in baseline 1, 0.77 +/- 1.01 in baseline 2). Rectal motility was also similar during baseline in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (1.43 +/- 2.56 in baseline 1, 1.65 +/- 2.47 in baseline 2) and controls (0.56 +/- 0.80 in baseline 1, 0.62 +/- 0.94 in baseline 2). Patients showed a lower tolerance for balloon distention of the colon (average, 130 vs. 184 ml) and a greater amount of contractile activity than controls after balloon distention (rectosigmoid activity index, 1.05 +/- 1.24 vs. 0.07 +/- 0.14; rectal activity index, 2.75 +/- 3.71 vs. 0.13 +/- 0.31). Maximum tolerable volume of balloon distention was inversely correlated to complaints of diarrhea in patients. Slow wave myoelectric activity did not differentiate patients from controls. These findings suggest that diarrhea, and possibly other gastrointestinal symptoms associated with progressive systemic sclerosis, may be due to decreased compliance of the bowel.\r"

Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid both inhibited pokeweed mitogen-stimulated secretion of immunoglobulins (Igs) A, G, and M by peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas sulfapyridine had little effect. Sulfasalazine and 5-aminosalicylic acid also inhibited spontaneous secretion of IgA by intestinal mononuclear cells, but sulfapyridine did not. Sulfasalazine inhibited pokeweed mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation, while 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine exhibited minimal inhibition. Sulfasalazine was toxic for peripheral blood mononuclear cells, whereas 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulfapyridine were not toxic. Thus, the inhibition of antibody secretion by sulfasalazine was due to direct toxicity. On the other hand, 5-aminosalicylic acid, the therapeutically active component of sulfasalazine, was neither toxic nor antiproliferative, and appeared to exert its effects on metabolic pathways directly related to antibody synthesis. The calculated ID50 values of 5-aminosalicylic acid for antibody secretion were 1.35 mM for IgA and 1.05 mM for IgG, concentrations that are achieved in the colons of treated individuals. Indomethacin did not inhibit antibody secretion at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. 5-Aminosalicylic acid mediated inhibition of antibody secretion may play a role in inflammatory bowel disease by stopping antibody-mediated memory events involved in the induction or perpetuation of the disease process.\r"

The present study was undertaken to discriminate between the effects of cholecystokinin and bombesin and to establish the modulating properties of the specific cholecystokinin receptor antagonist CR-1409 on pancreatic carcinogenesis. After initiation with 30 mg/kg of azaserine, six groups of 15 Wistar rats were treated for 16 wk with cholecystokinin, bombesin, or gelatin (control), some in combination with CR-1409. Doses of cholecystokinin (2.5 micrograms/kg) and bombesin (10 micrograms/kg) were chosen that rendered approximately equal plasma cholecystokinin levels. Both cholecystokinin and bombesin were found to stimulate pancreatic growth, whereas CR-1409 only inhibited the growth-promoting effect of cholecystokinin significantly. Furthermore, both peptides stimulated the development of putative preneoplastic lesions, whereas CR-1409 only inhibited the effect of cholecystokinin significantly. It is concluded that (a) CR-1409 inhibits the promoting effect of cholecystokinin on pancreatic growth and azaserine-induced early pancreatic lesions and (b) the effects of bombesin cannot be fully ascribed to stimulation of the secretion of endogenous cholecystokinin.\r"

Acetaminophen in dimethyl sulfoxide (600 mg/ml) given as three subcutaneous injections, with the first dose (750 mg/kg body wt) being given at noon, the second dose (200 mg/kg body wt) being given 9 h later, and the third dose (200 mg/kg body wt) being given 24 h after the initial dose consistently produces fulminant hepatic failure in dogs. The dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle, injected intramuscularly, does not influence either animal survival or hepatic function in control-treated dogs. No deaths occur within the first 36 h. By 72 h after initial drug administration, the mortality is 90%. Histopathological and biochemical investigations demonstrate a high degree of hepatocellular necrosis in nonsurviving animals without appreciable damage to the kidneys, lungs, or heart. The drug schedule and preparation outlined avoids the administration of large volumes of vehicle and results in prolonged high levels of acetaminophen in the blood sufficient to induce severe hepatic injury. Ranitidine (120 mg/kg body wt i.m.) given 30 min before each acetaminophen dose significantly reduces the mortality and hepatic necrosis produced using this model. This model satisfies all criteria established by Miller et al. for the production of a suitable large animal model of fulminant acute hepatic failure.\r"

Seven (27%) PBC patients were vitamin E-deficient based on the ratio of serum vitamin E to serum total lipid concentrations. An oral vitamin E tolerance test was performed in all patients and control subjects using a loading dose of 2000 IU alpha-tocopheryl acetate with measurement of serial serum vitamin E concentrations over 24 h. Vitamin E absorption was expressed as the maximal rise in serum vitamin E above baseline, the area under the oral tolerance test curve, and these two values divided by the fasting total serum lipid concentration. Absorption of vitamin E was significantly impaired in all PBC patients vs. control subjects (p less than 0.01), in vitamin E-deficient vs. vitamin E-sufficient PBC patients (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01), and in PBC patients with serum vitamin E levels below 10 micrograms/ml vs. those with serum vitamin E levels above 10 micrograms/ml (p less than 0.01). Vitamin E absorption was inversely related to stage of PBC, serum cholylglycine, total bilirubin, cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and prothrombin time. Patients with serum vitamin E below 10 micrograms/ml, serum total bilirubin above 3 mg/dl, serum cholylglycine above 600 micrograms/dl, or serum alkaline phosphatase above 1000 IU/L had severe malabsorption of vitamin E and would be at high risk for the development of vitamin E deficiency. Therefore, vitamin E supplementation should be considered not only in patients in whom overt vitamin E deficiency is present, but also in PBC patients meeting these criteria.\r"

A similar reduction was observed in mean basal parotid saliva flow rate in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis that reached statistical significance (p less than 0.05) in comparison with nonalcoholic control subjects. In addition, the concentration of sodium, bicarbonate, and total proteins in stimulated parotid saliva was significantly (p less than 0.005) lower in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis as compared with the two groups of control subjects. Sialograms in 6 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis did not reveal any obstructive lesion in the primary parotid duct or its branches. Histology of salivary tissue revealed an increase in the interstromal fatty infiltration, edema, and fibrosis without evidence of inflammatory reaction in 5 patients as compared with the control subjects. These data provide evidence for marked parotid gland dysfunction in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis presumably due to metabolic derangement and altered parotid gland structure.\r"

To study the clonal origin of the recurrent tumors, we examined five pairs of hepatocellular carcinomas resected from individual hepatitis B surface antigen carriers. Using integrated hepatitis B virus DNA as a marker, tumor clonality was determined by Southern blot analysis. In 2 cases the second tumor contained the same integrated viral DNA as the first one. In the other 3 cases, the clonality of the second cancer differed. We conclude that recurrent hepatocellular carcinomas originate from the first tumor in some cases but represent de novo neoplasms in others.\r"

One of these three communities was unacculturated and had the lowest average blood pressure as well as the lowest prevalence rate of hypertension in China; one was acculturated and had the highest average blood pressure; and the third was moderately acculturated with its average blood pressure between the other two. Blood pressure was taken on each of 3 days and corresponding 24-hour urine specimens were collected to measure potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Ecological and individual-based data correlation analyses were employed to study the relations among age, body mass index, some related indexes of electrolyte derivatives, and blood pressure. Multiple regression analyses were used to explore the relation of blood pressure to the above indexes, adjusted for age, body mass index, urea nitrogen and creatinine, and geographical differences. Statistically significant correlation analyses showed that systolic blood pressure was positively associated with sodium-creatinine, calcium-creatinine, sodium-potassium, calcium-magnesium, and urea nitrogen and creatinine ratios; negatively associated with potassium-creatinine and magnesium-creatinine ratios. The ridge regression analysis selected only calcium-magnesium ratio as a predictor of systolic blood pressure.\r"

Total urinary kallikrein excretion was highly familial with 51% of the total variance attributable to a dominant allele for high total urinary kallikrein excretion and 27% attributable to the combined effects of polygenes and shared family environment. An estimated 28% of the population has one or two copies of the dominant allele for high total urinary kallikrein excretion (2.3 SD units higher than the low homozygotes). About 83% of the population could be assigned to one of the two genotypic populations. Individuals with the high total urinary kallikrein excretion genotype were significantly less likely to have one or two hypertensive parents (relative odds = 0.56, p = 0.042). We conclude that a dominant allele expressed as high total urinary kallikrein excretion may be associated with decreased risk of essential hypertension. Further studies should be performed to confirm this finding and to test for interactions between this apparently protective gene and other genetic and environmental determinants of essential hypertension.\r"

The estimated ratio of intraindividual-to-interindividual variance was 1.12 for urinary sodium, 2.46 for urinary potassium, and 0.52 for urinary calcium. Based on these values, five 24-hour urine collections are necessary to reduce to less than 10% the diminution of the correlation coefficient between urinary sodium and another related variable; this number is substantially lower than that found in previous studies in a North American population sample, but similar to the one reported for Chinese population samples. Ten urinary collections are needed for potassium excretion. A different and more favorable situation is observed for 24-hour calcium excretion, as only two collections are necessary for the adequate characterization of individuals in a population.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether regression of hypertensive hypertrophy through blood pressure control also involves left ventricular collagen and consecutive alterations in left ventricular diastolic and systolic function, antihypertensive treatment with the calcium channel blocker nifedipine (30 mg/kg.day) was employed in 20-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 15) for a period of 20 weeks. Age-matched (40 weeks old) untreated (n = 13) and 20-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats representing the state before therapy (n = 14) were used for comparison. Myocardial stiffness was described by the tangent modulus Km of the elastic stiffness-stress relation. Left ventricular collagen was determined by means of hydroxyproline (OH-proline) concentration. Myocardial working capacity of the left ventricle was measured as the peak developed systolic pressure per weight unit muscle mass and systolic peak pump function as the maximum achievable cardiac output under volume loading. After the 20-week course of nifedipine treatment, systolic aortic pressure dropped from 187 +/- 11 to 144 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Regression of hypertrophy was shown by a left ventricular muscle/body weight ratio of 2.13 +/- 0.18 mg/g (p less than 0.01) in the 40-week-old nifedipine-treated hypertensive rats, whereas the ratios of the 20-week-old and 40-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats were 2.3 +/- 0.30 and 2.34 +/- 0.18 mg/g, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Oral administration of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 16617 significantly lowered mean arterial pressure. In contrast, both the thromboxane synthase inhibitor CGS 12970 and the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13505 lacked an antihypertensive action in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. When administered concurrently, the thromboxane synthase inhibitor CGS 12970 potentiated the antihypertensive action of the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor CGS 16617. This effect was not observed with the thromboxane receptor antagonist BM 13505. In addition to CGS 16617, CGS 12970 also potentiated the hypotensive effect of two structurally dissimilar angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, benazapril HCL and captopril. Indomethacin blocked the thromboxane synthase inhibition-induced potentiation of the antihypertensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. The thromboxane synthase inhibitor CGS 12970 had no effect on the hypotension induced by hydralazine, indicating that the hypotension is not a nonspecific action related to the fall in blood pressure. These results may suggest that converting enzyme inhibition augments the levels and actions of a hormone that stimulates prostaglandin formation. It is well established that thromboxane synthase inhibitors eliminate the formation of the vasoconstrictor thromboxane A2 and allow reorientation of eicosanoid production toward the formation of vasodilating prostaglandins, which could enhance the antihypertensive action of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.\r"

These oscillations are not observed in tail arteries from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The mechanism underlying these oscillatory contractions was investigated by simultaneous measurement of isometric force development and membrane potential (Em) from tail artery strips in vitro. After equilibration in physiological salt solution containing 1.6 mM calcium (37 degrees C), resting Em was not different between WKY (-52 +/- 1.1 mV) and SHRSP (-52 +/- 0.4 mV). Norepinephrine (3 x 10(-7) M) produced a similar degree of depolarization in tissues from the two strains (WKY = (-42.5 +/- 0.9, SHRSP = -41 +/- 0.8). However, while Em recordings from WKY arteries were quiescent, those from SHRSP displayed bursts of electrical spiking activity that were temporally associated with the rising phase of oscillations in contractile force. The frequency and duration of these bursts of action potentials increased with the concentration of norepinephrine. Action potentials were not observed in calcium-free solution or in presence of nifedipine (3 x 10(-7) M). Releasing the passive stretch on the tissues caused a decrease in the rate of spiking. These studies demonstrate catecholamine-induced regenerative electrical activity in tail arteries from SHRSP that is dependent on extracellular calcium. This activity is unique to tail arteries from this strain.\r"

Systemic and regional hemodynamic measurements were determined by the radioactive microsphere technique in conscious and unrestrained rats (kidneys intact) with DOC-salt-induced hypertension that were pair-fed either a normal calcium (0.6% by weight, n = 12) or a calcium-supplemented (high-calcium) diet (2.5% by weight, n = 12). After 7 to 8 weeks, there were no differences in weight, heart rate, or cardiac output between the two groups. In contrast, the high-calcium rats had a significantly lower mean blood pressure (125 +/- 4 mm Hg, mean +/- SEM) than the normal calcium rats (143 +/- 5 mm Hg); this finding appeared to result predominantly from a reduction in total peripheral resistance. The high-calcium rats had a higher renal blood flow (7.8 +/- 0.5% vs. 6.2 +/- 0.4% cardiac output; p less than 0.05) and lower renal (14.3 +/- 1 vs. 19.3 +/- 2 mm Hg/min/ml/g tissue; p less than 0.05) and jejunal vascular resistance than did the normal calcium rats. Two additional identical groups of normal calcium-and high-calcium-DOC-salt rats (n = 12 each) were also studied. In these rats, serum-ionized calcium decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) from baseline in both groups. Urinary sodium increased in both groups but did not differ significantly. In conclusion, dietary calcium supplementation attenuates the rise in peripheral vascular resistance that accompanies DOC-salt hypertension. This attenuated resistance appears to be relatively selective and is noted particularly in the renal vasculature.\r"

No effect of any pretreatment on basal values of blood pressure and heart rate was detected in either of these strains. In spontaneously hypertensive rats intracisternal pretreatment with naltrexone resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. DL-naloxone also antagonized the hypotension but not influence the hypotensive and bradycardic response to clonidine. In Wistar-Kyoto rats naltrexone and the beta-endorphin antiserum B4 failed to affect the cardiovascular effects of clonidine. B4 and an antiserum against dynorphin(1-13) inhibited clonidine-induced hypotension in spontaneously hypertensive rats, whereas a [Met5]enkephalin antiserum had no effect. Use of antisera specifically recognizing the C-terminus of beta-, alpha-, and gamma-endorphin, respectively, revealed that only the beta-endorphin antiserum inhibited the fall in blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats after cumulative administration of clonidine. None of the antisera used affected clonidine-induced bradycardia. These results indicate that activation of stereospecific opiate receptors in spontaneously hypertensive, but not in Wistar-Kyoto rats, plays a role in the central hypotensive effect of clonidine. beta-Endorphin(1-31) and dynorphin(1-13) might be the endogenous ligands for these receptors.\r"

The following study evaluated the effect of an experimental rhinovirus (RV) illness on airway reactivity and response to antigen in 10 adult ragweed allergic rhinitis patients. Preinfection studies included measurements of airway reactivity to histamine and ragweed antigen. Furthermore, the patients were also evaluated for late asthmatic reactions (LARs) to antigen (a 15% decrease in forced expiratory volume of the first second approximately 6 h after antigen challenge). 1 mo after baseline studies, the patients were intranasally inoculated with live RV16. All 10 patients were infected as evidenced by rhinovirus recovery in nasal washings and respiratory symptoms. Baseline FEV1 values were stable throughout the study. During the acute RV illness, there was a significant increase in airway reactivity to both histamine and ragweed antigen (P = 0.019 and 0.014, respectively). Before RV inoculation, only 1 of the 10 subjects had an LAR after antigen challenge. However, during the acute RV illness, 8 of 10 patients had an LAR (P less than 0.0085 compared with baseline); the development of LARs was independent of changes in airway reactivity and the intensity of the immediate response to antigen. Therefore, we found that not only does a RV respiratory tract illness enhance airway reactivity, but it also predisposes the allergic patient to develop LARs, which may be an important factor in virus-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with essential hypertension show an increase in vascular resistance. It is unclear whether this is caused by structural changes in the arterial wall or by hyperresponsiveness of vascular smooth muscle to endogenous alpha adrenergic agonists. Using the dorsal hand vein compliance technique we compared the changes in diameter of superficial veins in response to phenylephrine, an alpha 1 adrenergic receptor agonist, and to nitroglycerin, a venorelaxant, in patients with essential hypertension and in normotensive subjects. The dose of phenylephrine that produced 50% of maximal venoconstriction (ED50) in the hypertensive subjects was 257 ng/min (geometric mean; log mean +/- SD was 2.41 +/- 0.54). In the control subjects the ED50 was 269 ng/min (geometric mean; log mean was 2.43 +/- 0.43). Maximal response (Emax) for phenylephrine was 84 +/- 13% in the hypertensive subjects and 90 +/- 6% in the control subjects. Differences in the group means of the ED50 (P = 0.92) or the Emax (P = 0.27) were not significant. There were no significant differences in the ED50 (P = 0.54) or the Emax (P = 0.08) for nitroglycerin between the two groups. These results show no evidence for a generalized change in alpha adrenergic responsiveness in hypertension and support the concept that increased blood pressure responses to alpha adrenergic stimulation in hypertensives are due to structural and geometric changes in the arterial wall rather than to an increased responsiveness of postsynaptic alpha adrenergic receptors. The phenylephrine studies were repeated in seven hypertensive patients during treatment with prazosin, an alpha 1 adrenergic antagonist. The mean dose ratio of the shift in phenylephrine ED50 (ED50 during prazosin therapy/ED50 before prazosin therapy) was 6.1. This indicates that small doses of prazosin (1-2 mg) cause significant in vivo shifts in the dose-response relationship of alpha adrenergic agonists. The dorsal hand vein compliance technique is useful in detecting systemic effects of alpha adrenergic antagonists.\r"

We have cloned and sequenced HPRTYale cDNA. The nucleotide sequence of full-length HPRTYale cDNA revealed a single nucleotide substitution compared with normal HPRT cDNA: G----C at nucleotide position 211. This transversion predicts substitution of arginine for glycine at amino acid position 71, explaining the cathodal migration of HPRTYale. Chou-Fasman secondary structure analysis predicts a change in the probability of beta-turn formation in the region containing the mutation. Inclusion of the bulky arginine side chain in place of glycine probably disrupts protein folding as well. Cloning mutant forms of cDNA allows identification of specific mutations, provides insight into mutational mechanisms, and facilitates structure-function analysis of mutant proteins.\r"

Furosemide-treated animals were offered saline as drinking fluid to replace urinary losses. Effects of naCl intake were evaluated using free-flow micropuncture, in vivo microperfusion, and morphometric techniques. Dietary NaCl restriction did not affect NaCl delivery to the early distal tubule but markedly increased the capacity of the distal convoluted tubule to transport Na and Cl. Chronic furosemide infusion increased NaCl delivery to the early distal tubule and also increased the rates of Na and Cl transport above the rates observed in low NaCl diet rats. When compared with high NaCl intake alone, chronic furosemide infusion with saline ingestion increased the fractional volume of distal convoluted tubule cells by nearly 100%, whereas dietary NaCl restriction had no effect. The results are consistent with the hypotheses that (a) chronic NaCl restriction increases the transport ability of the distal convoluted tubule independent of changes in tubule structure, (b) high rates of ion delivery to the distal nephron cause tubule hypertrophy, and (c) tubule hypertrophy is associated with increases in ion transport capacity. They indicate that the distal tubule adapts functionally and structurally to perturbations in dietary Na and Cl intake.\r"

The endothelial cells from diabetic rats of 2 mo duration had persistent biological and biochemical defects in culture. Compared with normal rats, endothelial cells from diabetic rats grew 44% more slowly. Binding studies of insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) showed that cells from diabetic rats had 50% decrease of insulin receptor binding (nondiabetic: 4.6 +/- 0.7; diabetic: 2.6 +/- 0.4% per milligram protein, P less than 0.01), which was caused by a 50% decrease in the number of binding sites per milligram protein, whereas IGF-I binding was not changed. Insulin stimulation of 2-deoxy-glucose uptake and alpha-aminoisobutyric acid uptake were also severely impaired with a 80-90% decrease in maximal stimulation, in parallel with a 62% decrease in insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation (P less than 0.05). 125I-insulin cross-linking revealed an 140-kD alpha subunit of the insulin receptor similar to that in cells from nondiabetic rats, although bands at greater than 200 kD were also detected. The molecular weight of the insulin receptor beta subunit (by SDS-PAGE) was smaller in cells from diabetic than from normal rats (88-90 vs. 95 kD). Neuraminadase treatment of the partially purified insulin receptors decreased the molecular weight of the insulin receptors from nondiabetic rats to a greater degree than its diabetic counterpart. In contrast, Northern blot analysis of insulin receptor mRNAs using human cDNA probes revealed two species of 9.4 and 7.2 kb with no difference in mRNA abundance between cells from diabetic and nondiabetic rats. We conclude that the exposure of capillary endothelial cells to a diabetic milieu in vivo can cause specific and persistent changes in the insulin receptor and insulin action.\r"

M., B. N. Premachandra, and G. Fierer. 1985. Am. J. Physiol. 248:G545-G550). To directly test this postulate, and to test more generally whether albumin might play a special role in T4 transport in the rat, we performed in vivo kinetics studies in six Nagase analbuminemic rats and in six control rats, all of whom had similar serum T4 concentrations and percent free T4 values. Evaluation of the plasma disappearance curves of simultaneously injected 125I-T4 and 131I-albumin indicated that the flux of T4 from the extracellular compartment into the rapidly exchangeable intracellular compartment was similar in the analbuminemic rats (51 +/- 21 ng/min, mean +/- SD) and in the control rats (54 +/- 15 ng/min), as was the size of the rapidly exchangeable intracellular pool of T4 (1.13 +/- 0.53 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.36 micrograms). This latter finding was confirmed by direct analysis of tissue samples (liver, kidney, and brain). We also performed in vitro kinetics studies using the isolated perfused rat liver. The single-pass fractional extraction by normal rat liver of T4 in pooled analbuminemic rat serum was indistinguishable from that of T4 in pooled control rat serum (10.9 +/- 3.3%, n = 3, vs. 11.4 +/- 3.4%). When greater than 98% of the albumin was removed from normal rat serum by chromatography with Affi-Gel blue, the single-pass fractional extraction of T4 (measured by a bolus injection method) did not change (16.3 +/- 2.1%, n = 5, vs. 15.2 +/- 2.5%). These data provide the first valid experimental test of the enhanced dissociation hypothesis and indicate that there is no special, substantive role for albumin in T4 transport in the rat.\r"

By receiver operating characteristic analysis, LS-BMD was better than UDR-BMD (P less than 0.01) as an indicator of vertebral fracture; the converse was true for Colles' fracture (P less than 0.01). Although UDR-BMD and LS-BMD were lower in each of the three fracture groups than in controls (P less than 0.01), the pattern of bone loss differed (P less than 0.001, analysis of variance): with vertebral fracture, LS-BMD decreased relatively more than UDR-BMD; with Colles' fracture, UDR-BMD decreased relatively more than LS-BMD; and with both fractures, decreases in LS-BMD and UDR-BMD were similar.

In both cell lines differentiation from myoblasts to myocytes was associated with a 5-10-fold increase in specific 125I-insulin binding to intact cells. When 125I-insulin binding was carried out on solubilized myocytes and myoblasts, 125I-insulin binding to myoblasts was low. After differentiation the number of insulin receptors increased 5-10-fold. In contrast to insulin binding, insulin growth factor I receptor binding was elevated in myoblasts and was decreased by 50% in myocytes. Specific radioimmunoassay of the insulin receptor indicated that the increase in insulin binding to myocytes was due to an increase in insulin receptor content. Studies employing [35S]methionine indicated that this increase in insulin-binding sites reflected an increase in insulin receptor biosynthesis. To study insulin receptor gene expression, myoblast and myocyte mRNA was isolated and analyzed on Northern and slot blots. Differentiation from myoblasts to myocytes was accompanied by a 5-10-fold increase in insulin receptor mRNA. These studies demonstrate, therefore that differentiation in muscle cells is accompanied by increased insulin receptor biosynthesis and gene expression.\r"

  ".U": "89093420\r", 
  ".W": "Fasting in the rat is associated with a rapid and progressive decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in adipose cells, which is not only restored to normal, but increased transiently to supranormal levels by refeeding. The mechanisms for these changes in glucose transport activity appear to involve alterations in both glucose transporter number and intrinsic activity (glucose turnover number). In this study, we use the human hepatoma Hep G2 glucose transporter complementary DNA clone to examine the molecular basis for these alterations. Extractable RNA per adipose cell is decreased 35% with 3 d of fasting and increased to 182% of control with 6 d of refeeding after 2 d of fasting. This parallels changes in adipose cell intracellular water, so that total RNA/water space remains relatively constant. When the changes in total RNA/cell are taken into account, Northern and slot blot analyses with quantitative densitometry reveal a 36% decrease in specific glucose transporter mRNA level in cells from the fasted rats. The mRNA level in cells from the fasted/refed rats is restored to normal. These observations correlate closely with previous measurements of glucose transporter number in adipose cell membrane fractions using cytochalasin B binding and Western blotting. The levels of specific mRNAs for tubulin and actin on a per cell basis show similar but more dramatic changes and mRNAs encoding several differentiation-dependent adipose cell proteins are also significantly affected. Thus, the levels of mRNA for multiple adipose cell genes are affected by fasting and refeeding. In particular, this demonstrates that in vivo metabolic alterations can influence the level of a glucose transporter mRNA in adipose cells. This may have implications for the regulation of glucose transporter number and glucose transport activity.\r"

  ".W": "Activated protein C (APC), an anticoagulant that acts by inactivating Factors Va and VIIIa, is dependent on a suitable surface for its action. In this study we examined the ability of human platelets to provide this surface and support APC-mediated anticoagulant effects. The activity of APC was examined in three systems: the Factor Xa recalcification time of Al(OH)3 adsorbed plasma, studies of thrombin generation in recalcified plasma, and assessment of the rate of inactivation of purified Factor Va. In comparison with phospholipid, intact platelets required significantly greater concentrations of APC to achieve a similar degree of anticoagulation. When washed platelet membranes were substituted for intact platelets, adequate support of APC was observed and the anticoagulant effect was similar to that obtained with phospholipid. Platelet releasate obtained by stimulation of platelets with thrombin and epinephrine contained an inhibitor that interfered with the ability of phospholipid and washed platelet membranes to catalyze the anticoagulant effects of APC. A noncompetitive inhibition was suggested by Dixon plot analysis of the interaction between platelet releasate and APC. The activity of the platelet APC inhibitor was immediate and was not enhanced by heparin, distinguishing it from the circulating protein C inhibitor. The presence of this inhibitor in the platelet and its release with platelet stimulation emphasizes the procoagulant role of this cell.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoclasts resorb bone by first attaching to the bone surface and then secreting protons into an isolated extracellular compartment formed at the cell-bone attachment site. This secretion of protons (local acidification) is required to solubilize bone hydroxyapatite crystals and for activity of bone collagen-degrading acid proteases. However, the large quantity of protons required, 2 mol/mol of calcium, would result in an equal accumulation of cytosolic base equivalents. This alkaline load must be corrected to maintain cytosolic pH within physiologic limits. In this study, we have measured cytoplasmic pH with pH-sensitive fluorescent compounds, while varying the extracellular ionic composition of the medium, to determine the nature of the compensatory mechanism used by osteoclasts during bone resorption. Our data show that osteoclasts possess a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger that enables them to maintain normal intracellular pH in the face of a significant proton efflux. This conclusion follows from the demonstration of a dramatic cytoplasmic acidification when osteoclasts that have been incubated in bicarbonate-containing medium are transferred into bicarbonate-free medium. This acidification is absolutely dependent on and proportional to medium [Cl-]. Furthermore, acidification is inhibited by the classic inhibitor of red cell anion exchange, 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate, and by diphenylamine-2-carboxylate, an inhibitor of chloride specific channels. However, the acidification process is neither energy nor sodium dependent. The physiologic importance of chloride/bicarbonate exchange is demonstrated by the chloride dependence of recovery from an endogenous or exogenous alkaline load in osteoclasts. We conclude that chloride/bicarbonate exchange is in large part responsible for cytoplasmic pH homeostasis of active osteoclasts, showing that these cells are similar to renal tubular epithelial cells in their regulation of intracellular pH.\r"

PMN of patients expressed markedly enhanced phagocytosis as measured by the ingestion of erythrocyte (E)IgG and IgG/C3b-coated E. Phagocytosis of E coated with C3b alone was not seen, while low levels of ingestion of iC3b-E by patients' PMNs was noted. Monocytes from patients and controls expressed similar phagocytic activity in a fixed endpoint assay; however, the kinetics of phagocytosis by patients' monocytes was strikingly faster. Superoxide anion (O2.) and myeloperoxidase activities were similar to controls in PMN of four patients studied on day 1 of admission. PMN from two of three patients studied longitudinally showed an initial elevation in EIgG phagocytosis, which fell to normal levels by day 4, concomitantly with increased O2. generation and clinical improvement. Phagocytosis remained elevated in the third patient who did not clear his septicemia. Surface membrane FcRII, FcRIII, CR1, and CR3 were similar on patient and control PMN. In contrast, FcRI was increased on PMN of five of seven patients by monomeric IgG binding, and on two of two patients by monoclonal anti-FcRI binding. Thus, PMN and monocytes of patients with acute bacterial infections are either upregulated with regard to phagocytic function or are less susceptible to downregulation than are normal cells. This presumably would have a beneficial effect on host defenses during infection.\r"

Biopsies were obtained endoscopically from the duodenum in 17 normal subjects, 3 of whom were mildly iron deficient, and 7 patients with untreated IH. The absorption of both heme and nonheme iron was increased in IH despite a 20-fold elevation in serum ferritin. Immunoassays using MAb were used to measure transferrin, H-rich ferritin, and L-rich ferritin in mucosal samples. Mucosal transferrin concentrations in normal subjects did not correlate with either iron status or iron absorption, indicating that mucosal transferrin plays no physiological role in iron absorption. Mucosal transferrin was significantly lower in IH, presumably because of a decrease in mucosal transferrin receptors. Mucosal H and L ferritin concentrations were directly related to body iron stores and inversely related to iron absorption in normal subjects. In IH, mucosal H and L ferritin failed to increase in parallel with the serum ferritin, but were appropriate for the level of iron absorption. The relationship of mucosal H/L ferritin in IH did not differ from that observed in normal subjects. Our findings indicate that the major abnormality in duodenal iron proteins in IH is a parallel decrease in the concentration of H- and L-rich ferritin. It is not evident whether this is the result or the cause of the absorptive abnormality.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on subendothelium, studied at a shear rate of 2,600 s-1, were inhibited by two synthetic peptides known to interact with GPIIb-IIIa. One peptide (HHLGGAKQAGDV) corresponds to the carboxyl terminal segment of the fibrinogen gamma-chain (gamma 400-411) and the other (RGDS) contains the amino acid sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) common to fibronectin, von Willebrand factor, vitronectin and the alpha-chain of fibrinogen. Neither platelet adhesion nor thrombus formation were decreased in a patient with severe congenital fibrinogen deficiency and this was equally true when his blood was further depleted of the small amounts of fibrinogen present utilizing an anti-fibrinogen antibody. In normal subjects, adhesion and thrombus formation were inhibited by the Fab' fragments of a monoclonal anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody (LJ-CP8), which interferes with the interaction of platelets with all four adhesive proteins in both the fluid and solid phase. However, another anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibody (LJ-P5) that had minimal effects on the interaction of platelets with fibrinogen, but inhibited to varying degrees platelet interaction with other adhesive proteins, was equally effective. The findings demonstrate that, at a shear rate of 2,600 s-1, adhesive proteins other than fibrinogen are involved in GPIIb-IIIa-mediated platelet adhesion and thrombus formation on subendothelium. In addition, since LJ-P5 inhibited the binding of soluble von Willebrand factor and vitronectin, these adhesive proteins may be involved in platelet thrombus formation. In contrast to the results obtained at a shear rate of 2,600 s-1, fibrinogen could play a role in mediating platelet-platelet interactions with weak agonists or lower shear rates.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the hypothesis that lysosomes are the main source of biliary copper in conditions of hepatic copper overload. We used a rat model of oral copper loading and studied the relationship between the biliary output of copper and lysosomal hydrolases. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given tap water with or without 0.125% copper acetate for up to 36 wk. Copper loading produced a 23-fold increase in the hepatic copper concentration and a 30-65% increase in hepatic lysosomal enzyme activity. Acid phosphatase histochemistry showed that copper-loaded livers contained an increased number of hepatocyte lysosomes; increased copper concentration of these organelles was confirmed directly by both x ray microanalysis and tissue fractionation. The copper-loaded rats showed a 16-fold increase in biliary copper output and a 50-300% increase in biliary lysosomal enzyme output. In the basal state, excretory profiles over time were similar for biliary outputs of lysosomal enzymes and copper in the copper-loaded animals but not in controls. After pharmacologic stimulation of lysosomal exocytosis, biliary outputs of copper and lysosomal hydrolases in the copper-loaded animals remained coupled: injection of colchicine or vinblastine produced an acute rise in the biliary output of both lysosomal enzymes and copper to 150-250% of baseline rates. After these same drugs, control animals showed only the expected increase in lysosomal enzyme output without a corresponding increase in copper output. We conclude that the hepatocyte responds to an increased copper load by sequestering excess copper in an increased number of lysosomes that then empty their contents directly into bile. The results provide direct evidence that exocytosis of lysosomal contents into biliary canaliculi is the major mechanism for biliary copper excretion in hepatic copper overload.\r"

A number of thyroid hormone analogues have been shown to compete with [125I]triiodothyronine ([125I]T3) for binding to the intranuclear thyroid hormone receptor and to have agonist activity proportional to their affinities for the receptors. We report that the benzofuran amiodarone acts as a competitive antagonist to thyroid hormone action as defined by its dose-dependent ability to (a) bind to the thyroid hormone receptor and (b) inhibit T3-induced increases in growth hormone mRNA levels in a cultured rat pituitary cell line, GC cells. Like T3 itself, amiodarone also decreases transport of [125I]T3 across GC cell membranes. An analysis of the amiodarone structure suggests that this compound has certain similarities to T3. These findings hold promise for the development of other thyroid hormone antagonists for clinical use and for understanding thyroid hormone action.\r"

  ".W": "The molecular events that mediate cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated pancreatic secretion are not well defined because of the complex receptor-binding and concentration-response characteristics of this hormone. Functional models of receptor occupancy initiating the cascade leading to secretion have been complicated by the inhibition of secretion effected by supramaximal concentrations of CCK. Recent report of a CCK analogue that does not exhibit supramaximal inhibition led us to synthesize a similar analogue that could also be radiolabeled for studies of receptor binding and affinity labeling, and for studies of second messenger activity. This probe, D-Tyr-Gly-[(Nle28,31)CCK-26-32]-phenethyl ester, was a fully efficacious secretagogue with no supramaximal inhibition, and, unlike native hormone, bound to a single class of sites present on both acini and membranes. Occupation of this site correlated well with stimulation of secretion. Evidence that this was indeed a CCK-binding site were the abilities of CCK and the antagonist L-364, 718 to inhibit binding of this analogue. Affinity labeling confirmed the identity of the site mediating secretory stimulation as a Mr = 85,000-95,000 protein. Whereas the nonhydrolyzable guanosine triphosphate analogue, 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, was a potent inhibitor of CCK binding, it had no effect on binding of this secretagogue, suggesting that a novel cascade not involving a guanine nucleotide-binding protein mediates CCK stimulation of pancreatic secretion.\r"

This study examined whether an infusion of IGF-I will increase RPF and GFR, whether this effect occurs quickly, and if this effect is dependent on eicosanoids or peptide hormones known to affect renal function. Rats fasted for 3 d to reduce IGF-I and IGF-I plasma binding proteins were anesthetized; then the rats received an intravenous injection of 25 micrograms/kg IGF-I, and an infusion of 25 micrograms/kg IGF-I within 20 min. Controls received infusion of the vehicle. RPF (para-aminohippurate clearances), GFR (inulin clearances), renal vascular resistance (RVR), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), plasma IGF-I, and glucose concentrations were measured repeatedly. At the end of the 20-min infusion, plasma IGF-I tended to be increased in the animals that received IGF-I (P = 0.069), but did not increase in the control rats. IGF-I induced a significant and sustained fall in RVR and rise in RPF and GFR without any change in MABP. A small, transient, but significant decrease in plasma glucose concentrations was observed during IGF-I but not during vehicle infusion. Indomethacin, but not somatostatin, blocked the renal response to IGF-I infusion. Thus, IGF-I infusion increases RPF and GFR and reduces RVR in fasted rats. This effect requires the presence of eicosanoids but does not seem to require other peptide hormones suppressed by somatostatin.\r"

A novel human cDNA, which has extra 138 bases coding 46 amino acids, was isolated from a lymphoblastoid cell library. Sequencing of genomic DNA amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that the extra sequence was derived from the 3'-end of intron 7 by alternative splicing. This longer form of mRNA was also detected in sperm and granulocytes. Sequence analysis using PCR-amplified cDNA revealed that the 5'-end of the coding sequence of G6PD mRNA in reticulocytes is identical to those in other tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Fructose raises blood glucose and lactate levels in normal as well as diabetic man, but the tissue origin (liver and/or kidney) of these responses and the role of insulin in determining the end products of fructose metabolism have not been fully established. Splanchnic and renal substrate exchange was therefore examined during intravenous infusion of fructose or saline in six insulin-deficient type I diabetics who fasted overnight and in five healthy controls. Fructose infusion resulted in similar arterial concentrations and regional uptake of fructose in the two groups. Splanchnic glucose output increased threefold in the diabetics but remained unchanged in controls in response to fructose infusion, and the arterial glucose concentration rose more in diabetics (+5.5 mmol/liter) than in controls (+0.5 mmol/liter). Splanchnic uptake of both lactate and pyruvate increased twofold in response to fructose infusion in the diabetics. In contrast, a consistent splanchnic release of both lactate and pyruvate was seen during fructose infusion in controls. In diabetics fructose-induced hyperglycemia was associated with no net renal glucose exchange, while there was a significant renal glucose production during fructose infusion in the controls. In both groups fructose infusion resulted in renal output of lactate and pyruvate. In the diabetics this release corresponded to the augmented uptake by splanchnic tissues. In two diabetic patients given insulin infusion, all responses to fructose infusion were normalized. Fructose infusion in diabetics did not influence either splanchnic ketone body production or its relationship to splanchnic FFA inflow. We conclude that in insulin-deficient, mildly ketotic type I diabetes, (a) both the liver, by virtue of lactate, pyruvate, and fructose-derived gluconeogenesis, and the kidneys , by virtue of fructose-derived lactate and pyruvate production, contribute to fructose-induced hyperglycemia; (b) outcome of hepatic fructose metabolism; and (c) fructose does not exert an antiketogenic effect. These data suggest that while total fructose metabolism is not altered in diabetics, intermediary hepatic fructose metabolism is dependent on the presence of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Antacids used to decrease phosphorus absorption in patients with renal failure may be toxic. To find more efficient or less toxic binders, a three-part study was conducted. First, theoretical calculations showed that phosphorus binding occurs in the following order of avidity: Al3+ greater than H+ greater than Ca2+ greater than Mg2+. In the presence of acid (as in the stomach), aluminum can therefore bind phosphorus better than calcium or magnesium. Second, in vitro studies showed that the time required to reach equilibrium varied from 10 min to 3 wk among different compounds, depending upon solubility in acid and neutral solutions. Third, the relative order of effectiveness of binders in vivo was accurately predicted from theoretical and in vitro results; specifically, calcium acetate and aluminum carbonate gel were superior to calcium carbonate or calcium citrate in inhibiting dietary phosphorus absorption in normal subjects. We concluded that: (a) inhibition of phosphorus absorption by binders involves a complex interplay between chemical reactions and ion transport processes in the stomach and small intestine; (b) theoretical and in vitro studies can identify potentially better in vivo phosphorus binders; and (c) calcium acetate, not previously used for medical purposes, is approximately as efficient as aluminum carbonate gel and more efficient as a phosphorus binder than other currently used calcium salts.\r"

  ".W": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pretreatment \"primes\" neutrophils to release increased amounts of superoxide anion (O2-) when stimulated. We investigated the molecular basis of this enhanced activity. Comparison of kinetic parameters of the respiratory burst NADPH oxidase in unstimulated LPS-primed and control neutrophils disclosed a similar Km for NADPH and no difference was seen in the content of cytochrome b. Pertussis toxin, which inhibits some G proteins, did not prevent priming. Change in membrane potential (delta psi) was five-fold greater in LPS-primed cells and paralleled the increased O2- release. Cytofluorographic analysis indicated that the increased change in delta psi was due to the creation of a new population of active cells. Changes in the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) are believed to antecede changes in delta psi. There was a consistent increment (67 +/- 8%, n = 12) in resting [Ca2+]i in cells preincubated with LPS compared with control. When stimulated, the peak [Ca2+]i was significantly higher in LPS-primed cells. Ca2+-dependent protein kinase C activity was unaltered in resting and FMLP-stimulated neutrophils preexposed to LPS. Addition to cells of the intracellular Ca2+ chelator MAPTAM before preincubation with LPS blocked the changes in [Ca2+]i and the enhanced respiratory burst that characterize LPS priming. The increased resting [Ca2+]i in LPS-primed cells may enhance stimulus-induced cellular activity by modifying a Ca2+-dependent step in signal transduction.\r"

A randomized prospective study to assess the efficacy of narrow excision (excision with 1-cm margins) for primary melanomas no thicker than 2 mm was conducted at the National Institute of Health in Milan, Italy, and five other countries. Narrow excision was performed in 305 patients and wide excision (margins of 3 cm or more) in 307 patients. The major prognostic criteria were well balanced in the two groups. The mean thickness of the melanomas was 0.99 mm in the narrow-excision group and 1.02 mm in the wide-excision group. The subsequent development of metastatic disease involving regional nodes and distant organs was not different in the two groups (4.6% and 2.3%, respectively, in the narrow-excision group as compared with 6.5% and 2.6% in the wide-excision group). Disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates (mean follow-up period was 55 months) were also similar in the two groups. Only three patients had a local recurrence as a first relapse. All had undergone narrow excision, and each had a primary melanoma with a thickness of 1 mm or greater.\r"

None of the recognized etiologies of tissue compromise (bacterial infection, tension, host vascular disease, excessive inflammation, or edema) could be identified. It is speculated that in the immunocompetent host, small vessel injury secondary to herpes simplex may eventuate in scarring if the subdermal vascular network is significantly compromised. Prophylactic oral acyclovir may be useful in select instances where tissue blood supply is judged clinically tenuous and the frequency of herpetic infection at the surgical site judged worrisome.\r"

We analyzed the impact of hearing impairment on 153 patients over 65 years of age screened in primary care practice. Functional and psychosocial impairment were measured using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), a standardized measure for assessing sickness related dysfunction. Hearing level was determined with pure tone audiometry. Multiple linear regression was used to adjust for patient case-mix differences and other clinical variables. After adjustment, a 10 dB increase in hearing loss was found to result in a 2.8 point increase in Physical SIP scores (95% confidence interval = 1.8-3.8), a 2.0 point increase in psychosocial SIP scores (95% confidence interval = 0.8-3.2) and a 1.3 point increase in overall SIP scores (95% confidence interval = 0.1-2.5). Poor hearing was associated with higher SIP scores and increased dysfunction. Thus, hearing impairment is an important determinant of function in the elderly.\r"

(The accepted normal threshold for abnormality is an apnea index more than 5.) Although three of seven psychometric tests (odd-even, category retrieval, face-hand test) showed diurnal effects on one or more of their subscores, with Alzheimer's patients having significantly poorer scores at the AM than at PM testing, overnight change scores in the psychometric tests were not significantly correlated with severity of sleep-disordered breathing. Further, only 18.1% of the disruptive (ie, requiring intervention) nocturnal behaviors of the Alzheimer's patients were temporally linked to sleep-disordered breathing. The current data suggest that sleep-disordered breathing in nonmedicated Alzheimer's patients is relatively mild and is not a predictor of either overnight mental status changes, of disruptive nocturnal behaviors, or of daytime behavioral fluctuations. Additional studies of more severely demented patients and possibly of sleeping pill effects would be useful in further evaluating the role of sleep apnea in Alzheimer behavioral changes.\r"

Correlation coefficients (r) for the elderly group comparing Cockcroft-Gault and Lott-Hayton against 24-hour creatinine clearance were 0.73 (P less than .005) and 0.60 (P less than .02) respectively, and r for the young subjects were 0.37 (P greater than .05) and 0.57 (P less than .05), respectively. In 13 elderly subjects with creatinine clearance of 60 mL/minute or less, four (31%) had blood urea nitrogen of 20 mg/dL or less and 13 (100%) had serum creatinine between 1.0-1.5 mg/dL. We conclude that the formulas of Cockcroft-Gault and Lott-Hayton are valid in ambulatory elderly patients who are functionally independent without severe underlying disease, have normal body weight and are not on medication affecting renal function. Furthermore, in this select elderly population, an apparently normal serum creatinine (1.0-1.5 mg/dL) and blood urea nitrogen (20 mg/dL or less) may frequently represent a 24-hour creatinine clearance of 60 mL/minute or less.\r"

Eighty patients were studied, ranging in age from 65-91. Acute confusion was seen in one-fourth of these patients, who tended to be older, more ill, more likely to have chronic cognitive impairment and a higher mortality rate. In patients admitted with confusion, infection and congestive heart failure predominated. In those who developed confusion after hospitalization, iatrogenic disease was more common. Confusion was a sensitive sign of physical illness, and its resolution accompanied recovery. A diagnosis of the cause of the confusion state could be made in 22 of 24 cases. These findings support the aggressive investigation and treatment of acute confusion in the elderly.\r"

Auditory hallucinations, usually ascribed to psychiatric illness, take various forms including the perception of voices, cries, noises, or rarely, music. Formed musical hallucinations, (ie, the perception of either vocal or instrumental melodies), reported in the English literature to date have typically been associated with marked hearing loss, advanced age (average 67.8 years), female sex (71%), lack of response to treatment, and general lack of associated psychopathology. We have collected data on seven additional patients with musical hallucinations. The average age of these patients was 72.9 years; all were women. Six had significant hearing problems. All reported onset of musical hallucinations after the age of 60. Interestingly, all seven had major psychiatric illnesses. Four had major depression, two had late-onset schizophrenia, and one had multi-infarct dementia. Of the five who had CT scans, one was normal and the rest demonstrated varying degrees of brain pathology. Neuroleptics were used with varying results in three cases; antidepressants were used in two depressed patients and were temporally related to the onset of musical hallucinations in one patient. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was very effective in treating depression and musical hallucinations in the three patients for whom it was used, usually providing relief from hallucinations after only two treatments. Our collection of cases demonstrates that musical hallucinations can occur in association with psychiatric illness, and perhaps unlike the hallucinations associated with isolated hearing loss, may respond to conventional treatments for the underlying psychiatric disorder. Hearing loss is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition for the occurrence of musical hallucinations.\r"
