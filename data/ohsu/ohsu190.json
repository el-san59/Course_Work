Intramedullary metastases are more common than is generally believed and the incidence is probably increasing with the more prolonged survival of cancer patients. A wide spectrum of symptoms and signs may be produced, frequently with attendant diagnostic difficulties. Most patients present with myelopathy as the first manifestation of cancer or of its recurrence. Symptoms may be present for several months, with few clinical signs, despite distortion and destruction of much of the spinal cord by tumour. The extent of metastatic disease remains limited in a significant proportion of patients. No neurological symptoms or signs differentiate intramedullary metastases clearly from the more common extradural deposits. However, the diagnosis should be considered when myelopathy evolves more slowly, where plain radiographic evidence of adjacent vertebral disease is absent, and particularly when myelography is normal. Early diagnosis and aggressive medical treatment may provide for a more favourable outcome.\r"

In contrast to other reports, periodic paralysis was a presenting feature in 42 per cent of patients. Other notable symptoms were palpitations (30 per cent) and syncope (12 per cent). Vascular complications were present in 20 per cent of cases. Mean serum potassium level at presentation was 2.1 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SEM) and sodium 145.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l. Serum potassium was significantly lower and plasma aldosterone higher in patients with periodic paralysis. Adrenal venography in order to localise the tumour was unreliable and was misleading in two cases. Adrenal venous sampling for steroid analysis was much more helpful, despite the difficulty of obtaining right adrenal venous blood. The side of the adenoma could be predicted in 97 per cent of cases from measurements of left adrenal venous and vena caval aldosterone levels. The use of high resolution CT gave 100 per cent accuracy in all 18 patients who underwent surgery, the smallest detected tumour being 0.8 cm in diameter. Surgery corrected hypokalaemia in all cases, and 37 of the 46 patients required no further antihypertensive treatment.\r"

Sixty per cent of the patients were female. Median age at onset was 25 years and median observation period after onset was 41 months. For 28 patients detailed data were available of the first month of illness. In only 43 per cent of these did the disease present with the classical triad of fever, arthritis and rash, although in the whole group eventually, fever with temperatures of 40 degrees C or more occurred in 84 per cent, arthritis in 98 per cent, and the typical rash in 82 per cent. In 32 per cent of the patients with rash, this was pruritic. Other features seen frequently were: lymphadenopathy (71 per cent), splenomegaly (36 per cent), pleuritis and/or pneumonitis (31 per cent), pericarditis (22 per cent), leucocytosis (98 per cent) and hepatic abnormalities (84 per cent). The high spiking fever was reduced to normal in six of 21 cases (29 per cent) by aspirin, in 19 of 27 cases (70 per cent) by indomethacin and in six of seven cases (86 per cent) by naproxen. In 16 of 21 cases (76 per cent) glucocorticoids reduced the systemic and/or joint symptoms. In three patients who remained febrile on glucocorticoids, indomethacin reduced temperature to normal. Eight patients whose joint disease improved on steroids later developed severe joint destructions. Thirteen patients received one or several slow-acting antirheumatic drugs. Only in eight of 18 trials (44 per cent) with one of these drugs did symptoms and signs improve. Fifty-one per cent of the 45 patients had self-limiting disease and 49 per cent had persistent disease with continuous activity for at least one year. At the time of evaluation 47 per cent of the 45 patients were in remission without medication, 33 per cent were in remission while on medication and 20 per cent had active disease. Three life-threatening complications occurred: two patients developed signs of cardiac tamponade and one almost died from diffuse intravascular coagulation. Disability was determined primarily by the course of the arthritis. At the time of review 43 per cent of the 45 patients had no joint destruction (Group 1), 24 per cent had destruction of at least one joint, but had no evidence of disease of the root joints (Group 2) and 33 per cent had destruction in at least one root joint (Group 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Treatment with repeated oral doses of activated charcoal is simple and safe. It seems to be as effective as forced alkaline diuresis, haemodialysis and haemoperfusion for the removal of phenobarbitone following overdosage.\r"

We have studied the results of surgery in 21 patients with this disorder, all of whom were investigated and treated in a single referral centre, and evaluated the contributions of clinical, biochemical and pathological factors to blood pressure outcome. Blood pressure before surgery was high (mean 210/121 mmHg), but after an average period of 5.4 years 12 patients (60 per cent) were considered by their primary physician not to require antihypertensive medication and a further seven had reduced drug requirements. In only two patients was arterial pressure unimproved by surgery. Blood pressure recordings within six months of surgery were not a good predictor of later levels. Of the clinical, electrolyte, hormone and pathological features assessed, only the systolic pressure before surgery, and abnormalities in the optic fundi, correlated statistically with final blood pressure ranking. There was no relationship between the severity of vascular changes in the adrenal or kidney biopsy tissue and final blood pressure. These results show that while the blood pressure response to the removal of a single adrenal adenoma is usually good, it is not possible to predict accurately the final blood pressure response using these criteria.\r"

Two patients had temporary improvement in their symptoms, but relapsed in spite of continuing treatment. The remaining three patients completed six months of treatment with no improvement in their rheumatoid disease. There were no significant changes in rheumatological parameters, immunological markers of disease activity nor radiological evidence of improvement. Treatment did lead to significant falls in haemoglobin concentration (p less than 0.01), mean corpuscular volume (p less than 0.05) and serum ferritin levels (p less than 0.02). Therefore, in spite of a reduction in iron available for haem synthesis and a fall in tissue storage iron the rheumatoid inflammatory process persisted.\r"

The presence or absence of serum HBsAg was of no prognostic significance in British patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Liver cell dysplasia, a possible pre-malignant lesion, was noted in 53 per cent of patients who had had liver biopsies before the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in 79 per cent of biopsies taken at the time of diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.

The diagnosis was established in 22 of 113 patients (19 per cent) presenting with status epilepticus over a 23-month period. Non-convulsive status was most prevalent in the over 60 age group. Its two subgroups, absence status (18 cases) and complex partial status (four cases) were both manifest clinically by a prolonged alteration of consciousness of variable extent. Absence status presented de novo (six cases) or against a background of epilepsy (12 cases), often with a long seizure-free interval before presentation. Precipitating factors included infection, inadequate anticonvulsant medication and benzodiazepine withdrawal. The clouding of consciousness was usually characterised by confusion, disorientation and partial responsiveness. Myoclonic or clonic movements of the eyes, face or jaw were evident in all but two patients. Automatisms, including ambulatory behaviour (three cases) were less common. Serious psychiatric disorders preceded the status in seven cases, and contributed to the difficulty in diagnosis. Complex partial status was associated with underlying cerebrovascular disease in three of four cases, and is characterised by a more severe and variable clouding of consciousness, less frequent facial clonic movements, episodic adversive head and eye movements, and a more gradual recovery after treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1978, 220 patients with psoriatic arthritis have undergone detailed study at the Women's College Hospital in Toronto, Canada. Clinical, radiological and biochemical data were subjected to computer analysis in order to determine clinical-biochemical correlations within subsets of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Our findings indicate a spectrum of disease patterns and severity. Overall, we found a 40 per cent incidence of deforming, erosive arthropathy, with 17 per cent of patients having five or more deformed joints. ARA stage 3 and 4 radiological joint change occurred in 28 and 14 per cent respectively, and 11 per cent of patients had ARA Class III or IV functional impairment. The asymmetric oligoarthritis previously reported to account for the majority of cases of psoriatic arthritis was not a dominant pattern in our own experience, occurring in only 28 per cent of the series. Polyarthritis was the most common joint pattern, present in 61 per cent with symmetric and asymmetric patterns occurring equally. Our experience suggests that polyarthritis, symmetric or asymmetric, is a more common presentation of the disease than is generally acknowledged. Furthermore, the frequency of deforming destructive arthropathy challenges the concept of psoriatic arthritis as a benign arthropathy.\r"

  ".U": "88016827\r", 
  ".W": "Two hundred and eighty-six patients presenting with metastatic adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma whose primary site was not identified by clinical history, physical examination and chest radiograph have been studied. Median survival from presentation was 22 weeks. Factors independently predicting improved survival were lymph node presentations, good performance status and body weight loss of less than 10 per cent. In 88 (31 per cent) patients the primary tumour site was subsequently identified, in 58 (20 per cent) during life. Lung cancer was the most frequently identified primary tumour, and in only 32 (11 per cent) of the patients was a 'treatable' primary tumour (i.e. germ cell, breast, ovarian, prostate, thyroid cancer or lymphoma) identified. Among the treatable primary tumours were those in eight out of 16 female patients presenting with axillary metastases who were subsequently shown to have primary breast cancer and four of 13 females presenting with ascites who were found to have primary ovarian cancer. Prostatic cancer was confirmed in five out of 13 men with raised serum acid phosphatase. Of 22 patients with elevated serum alphafoetoprotein (AFP) or beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin levels (beta HCG) 18 had some features of the 'atypical teratoma syndrome'. Of the total of 32 patients with treatable tumour types, 29 (90 per cent) were identified during life. Median survival for patients with treatable tumour types identified during life was 104 weeks, compared with 22 weeks for the group as a whole. Retrospective immunocytochemical staining of the original biopsy showed that prostatic specific antigen and antibodies to beta HCG and AFP were diagnostically useful, but a series of organ site non-specific markers of histogenesis or cellular differentiation (carcinoembryonic antigen, secretory component for IgA, peanut lectin binding, epithelial membrane antigen and keratin) showed no significant correlations with identified primary sites, responsiveness to empirical chemotherapy or survival. Metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma or adenocarcinoma from an unknown primary site represents 6.5 per cent of all referrals to the medical oncology unit, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney. We offer guidelines for the rapid identification of the limited number of primary sites for which effective and specific forms of systemic treatment are available.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical course of 135 patients with lupus nephritis was examined long-term as part of a prospective study. Biopsies were classified according to modified WHO criteria and showed 17 per cent of patients had mild mesangial lesions, 10 per cent focal lesions, 21 per cent mild diffuse proliferative lesions, 37 per cent severe diffuse proliferative lesions and 15 per cent membranous lesions. Overall patient survival of 83 and 65 per cent at five and 10 years respectively from onset of nephritis was similar to other recently published series. In contrast to the latter, the severe proliferative group had a significantly worse outcome than the other proliferative groups (p less than 0.01) and only patients in this group progressed to end-stage renal failure. Haematuria was more common (p less than 0.05) in the severe group and there was a striking correlation between histologic activity assessed semiquantitatively (Table 1) and urinary red cell count (p less than 0.001). There was no correlation between serum creatinine, proteinuria or chronic lesions with urinary red cell count. In contrast to a previous study there was no correlation between the presence of hyaline thrombi on initial biopsy and subsequent development of glomerular sclerosis. Although the value of renal biopsy has been questioned, we suggest that it remains a most important investigation in the management of lupus nephritis. Determination of urinary red cell count provides a most useful monitor of disease activity and response to treatment.\r"

Although most patients (30 of 43) had significant renal impairment at the time of diagnosis (serum creatinine greater than 250 mumol/l) only five had a symptom, macroscopic haematuria, that directed attention to the kidneys. In the majority of patients in whom data was available there was rapid deterioration in renal function between presentation and diagnosis. Renal function at diagnosis was worse in patients aged over 50 of whom 20 out of 29 had a serum creatinine greater than 500 mumol/l compared with only four of 14 patients aged less than 50. The prognosis was worse in patients over 50 (41 per cent died), in patients with a serum creatinine higher than 500 mumol/l (54 per cent died) and in patients treated with intravenous methylprednisolone, (four also had intravenous cyclophosphamide) (38 per cent died). The major cause of death was sepsis and the actuarial one-year survival was 62 per cent. These results suggest that our approach to treatment should be modified towards lessening immunosuppression in older patients and in patients with renal failure at diagnosis.\r"

Twenty-two patients completed the course of treatment and recovered with minimal morbidity in three patients. Two patients died in a vegetative state from other causes seven and nine months after the start of treatment. No evidence of recurrence of meningitis was observed in the 21 patients who were regularly observed for 12 to 29 months after completing treatment. Four patients dropped out during the early stage of treatment. Intensive chemotherapy of tuberculous meningitis with this regimen before the development of serious neurological damage can shorten the duration of treatment to nine months with a favourable outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three patients with renal angiographic evidence of significant renal artery stenosis were referred for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. The indications were poorly controlled hypertension (n = 13) or hypertension associated with deteriorating renal function (n = 20). Their mean age was 56 (23-73) years (12 males, 21 females). Causes of the renal artery stenosis were fibromuscular dysplasia (n = 8) and atheromatous changes (n = 25). Four patients were excluded, three due to technical failure. Forty-five angioplasties were performed in 29 patients with a mean observation period after angioplasty of 18 (one to 60) months. During this period eight patients (28 per cent) had a diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mmHg without antihypertensive drugs, a further 15 patients (52 per cent) had improved blood pressure control with a significant reduction in the number and amount of antihypertensive drugs, but six patients (20 per cent) showed no improvement in blood pressure. Hypertension associated with the stenosis of fibromuscular dysplasia responded better to angioplasty than hypertension associated with atheromatous renal artery stenosis. Improvement in renal function was noted in eight patients with no change in 16 patients. Two patients with end-stage renal failure and atheromatous intrarenal vascular disease became dialysis dependent within four weeks of the procedure. One major and four minor complications occurred but there were no deaths related to angioplasty. Together with results from other centres this study indicates that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty should be considered the initial treatment choice for all patients with renovascular hypertension due to fibromuscular dysplasia and atheromatous renal artery stenosis.\r"

Mood disorder was not related to the type or severity of physical illness, but was significantly associated with previous psychiatric history and social problems. Two-thirds of those with mood disorder on admission who were still alive four months after discharge were improved. House officers and family doctors identified approximately half the cases of depression and anxiety, but house officers were no more likely to recognise the more severe cases than the milder ones. Organic psychiatric disorder was often missed, alcohol problems less so.\r"

Records of 152 weeks of daylight outdoor exposure were obtained from 104 Glasgow Asian children, 53 of whom had been treated for rickets. Records of seven-day weighed dietary intake were obtained from 84 Asian children, 43 of whom had been treated for rickets. There was a marked north-south gradient in the prevalence of Asian rickets. In all cases of severe rickets with deformity the child was vegetarian. Severe rickets was associated with lower intake of meat, higher intake of chapati and lower daylight outdoor exposure values than in normal children. Multivariate analysis employing a combination of these variables provided good separation between rachitic and normal groups. A risk-factor model is proposed which suggests that regional variation in the prevalence of rickets among Asian communities in Britain is mainly determined by the effects of latitude and the nature of the urban environment on available ultraviolet radiation. Where UV radiation is restricted, individual propensity to rickets within a given Asian community is mainly determined by dietary factors.\r"

After examination of general practitioner and hospital case notes, autopsy reports and death certificates, nearly all (532) of the North Staffordshire deaths were accepted as being due to ischaemic heart disease but only three-fifths (263) of the Grampian deaths could be substantiated as there was inadequate information for the remainder. Deaths from ischaemic heart disease seem apparently to be twofold greater in North Staffordshire than Grampian but much of this discrepancy could be attributed to a widely different autopsy rate and to unavailability of case notes. Experience of this survey suggests that the results of other epidemiological investigations may be equally or even more unreliable.\r"

CT brain scans suggested tuberculomata in all 10 patients; there were several lesions in five and histological confirmation was obtained in three cases. Earlier CT brain scans (six weeks to five months before) were carried out in five patients and in none was a tuberculoma seen. After treatment with anti-tuberculous drugs and control of raised intracranial pressure when present, five patients made a full recovery, three were left with mild neurological deficit and in two it is too early to assess the outcome.\r"

Of the remaining 48 subjects, 14 (29 per cent) had reduced TSH responses to TRH and 28 (64 per cent) decreased GH responses to L-dopa compared with our laboratory's reference ranges. Fifteen women (51 per cent) had low basal gonadotrophin levels of which 10 (34 per cent) gave a poor LH response to LHRH and eight (27 per cent) a poor FSH response. Forty-three subjects (93 per cent) gave a good ACTH response to metyrapone. Only six subjects (24 per cent) had an apparently normal pituitary fossa; 16 (64 per cent) had partially or completely empty fossas. There was no significant correlation between the diminished pituitary responses. Only one patient had responses which suggested panhypopituitarism. There was also no significant correlation between the appearance on CT scan of the pituitary fossa and the results of the dynamic tests. It is suggested that laboratory reference range for pituitary function which have been derived from young ambulatory subjects are not appropriate for hospital in-patients over the age of 75. A series of reference ranges for such subjects is proposed.\r"

Acid-fast bacilli, caseation and coexistent liver disease were detected in 59, 51 and 37 per cent of patients respectively. Since there was no consistent clinical pattern a high index of suspicion is necessary if this disease is to be detected in communities in which tuberculosis is endemic.

A review of 50 computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest that were normal save for possible cardiomegaly, together with chest radiographs obtained within a 14-day interval, revealed a wide variation in the configuration of this fat pad in 16 patients (32%). Depending on geometric circumstances, the fat pad may produce a well-marginated region of increased density, a region of increased density with poor margination, or an area of reduced density lying anterior to the heart. In an additional four patients (8%), however, a simulation of a cardiac fat pad was produced by cardiomegaly alone or by relative levoposition of the heart. In these four patients, the left side of the heart contacted the chest wall on the left over a larger than normal area and thereby excluded lung from the vicinity, simulating the appearance of a fat pad where none existed.\r"

Many authors have commented on the value of preoperative chest radiography as a screening examination, but no statistics have been presented regarding its impact on postoperative management. In 369 consecutive general surgical patients, the need for a baseline chest radiograph was evaluated. In 65 patients undergoing chest radiography postoperatively, a preoperative baseline was essential in making an accurate interpretation in 33 (51%). The value of preoperative chest radiography proved to be twofold. Some minimal abnormalities on postoperative radiographs were demonstrated to be clearly new, necessitating treatment or further evaluation. Second, significant abnormalities detected on postoperative radiographs that may have otherwise been subjected to expensive evaluation were often shown to have been present preoperatively. In approximately 9% of patients the preoperative chest radiograph had a significant impact on postoperative management.\r"

In a prospective study the nonionic, low-osmolality agent iopamidol eliminated the problem of image degradation due to coughing, and patients showed excellent tolerance for it. However, pressure measurements obtained within 3-5 minutes of injection of iopamidol and diatrizoate sodium meglumine 76% showed no significant difference in the hemodynamic effects of the two contrast agents, either for normotensive or for pulmonary hypertensive patients. Contrary to a common presumption, pulmonary hypertension by itself did not appear to increase the risk of pulmonary angiography. The theoretic presumption of greater hemodynamic stability with low-osmolality contrast agents was not clinically evident in this trial with iopamidol. At present, enhanced patient comfort and improved image quality remain the only confirmed bases for choosing this contrast agent for pulmonary angiography.\r"

Three criteria were tested: criterion 1 was defined as abnormal scans showing any defect; criterion 2, scans showing only transient (reversible) defects; and criterion 3, scans showing either transient or \"significant\" (i.e., not due to breast attenuation) fixed defects. The sensitivity in women was 1.00, 0.73, and 0.93, respectively; the specificity, 0.26, 0.84, and 0.85. The best values in men were a sensitivity of 1.00 and a specificity of 0.86. The three criteria were then prospectively tested in 33 scans of 29 additional women. The sensitivity was 0.90, 0.65, and 0.80, respectively, and the specificity, 0.18, 1.00, and 0.92.

There were no deaths or major complications and only six minor complications. Inferior vena cavography was done before filter insertion in all cases. Cavography is vital to determine feasibility of filter insertion, route of insertion, and filter location; pertinent findings include caval size, presence or absence of clot in the IVC or iliac veins, and position of the renal veins. The guide wire provided with the standard filter introduction set has a tendency to catch on the filter as the wire is withdrawn. A stiff wire with a straight, tapered, floppy tip was substituted. The femoral approach is preferred when it is feasible. Though there was only one known occurrence of femoral vein thrombosis at the filter insertion site, other cases may have occurred and may not have been detected. If the frequency of this complication proves to be significant, the preferred route for filter insertion may have to be reconsidered.\r"

With dynamic CT, patchy enhancement was present in 28 cases. Correlation with angiography in 15 cases revealed a normal portal blood flow in enhanced areas and an inversed portal blood flow in atrophic areas.

Irregular scalloping of adjacent bone was a highly suggestive feature, occurring with 11 dermoids. Other bone changes, such as linear defects, thinning, or sclerosis, also occurred. Superficial dermoids showed less apparent bone changes. An extraconal orbital lesion associated with adjacent bone thinning or notching should raise the possibility of a dermoid, especially if a rim with calcification is seen. The appearance is pathognomonic if fat density is also present.\r"

High-resolution MR imaging studies of the sella turcica in 200 subjects with a normal or abnormal sella were analyzed. The hyperintensity was found in the images of about 90% of healthy subjects and patients with microadenoma, in only 43% of patients with macroadenoma, and in 12% of patients with empty sellae. The signal was absent in several patients with functional or anatomic abnormalities of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis. It is concluded that the high signal intensity in the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is present in most healthy individuals and that its absence in many patients with large intrasellar masses and empty sellae is due to compression of posterior lobe tissue. Its absence in diabetes insipidus further suggests a relationship between hyperintensity and the functional status of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis.\r"

Contiguous sagittal T1-weighted images were obtained in all cases, and, in some, axial or coronal images were taken for further evaluation. On MR images, normal anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary gland can be clearly differentiated because the posterior lobe has a characteristic high intensity on T1-weighted images. In the ten patients, the high-intensity posterior lobe was not seen, but a similar high signal intensity was observed at the proximal stump in seven patients. This high-intensity area is the newly formed ectopic posterior lobe, which secretes antidiuretic hormone just as the posterior lobe would. When the ectopic lobe completely compensates for the impaired posterior lobe, endocrinologic data indicate normal posterior lobe function. However, MR imaging can reveal the transection of the pituitary stalk and formation of the ectopic lobe.\r"

Five cysts had both intra- and suprasellar components, one was entirely intrasellar, and the other was predominantly suprasellar in location. The size of the cysts ranged from 8 to 20 mm. CT scans demonstrated low-density homogeneous lesions in four cases. On MR images of three of these four cases, the cysts had the same intensity as cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images, while in the fourth case, the cyst was hyperintense on the T1-weighted images. In the remaining three cases, CT showed slight hyperdensity relative to brain parenchyma, suggestive of contrast enhancement. MR showed signal heterogeneity of these lesions with focal components of diminished signal intensity of T2-weighted images. These same foci appeared iso- to slightly hyperintense on T1-weighted images.\r"

Auditory pathway disease was characterized as involvement of the lateral lemniscus and medial geniculate body, and visual pathway disease was characterized by lateral geniculate body, Meyer loop, and optic radiation involvement. Contrast-enhanced CT still proved to have a greater capacity (at this time) to show the active, advancing form of the disease and concomitant calcifications.

On CT scans, the following characteristics were noted: (a) unilateral involvement; (b) extensive or multifocal areas of low density along white matter bundles, with ipsilateral ventricular dilatation and localized cortical atrophy; (c) nodular or irregular enhancement with spotty calcification; and (d) change in location of enhancing nodules on sequential scans. These pathognomonic features reflect a chronic inflammatory process with both active granulomatous lesions and widespread degeneration of brain tissue, especially in the white matter. Degeneration is probably caused by migration of the long-surviving larva along the fiber tracts of white matter.\r"

Sixteen thoracic disk herniations were confirmed with plain and CT myelography and/or surgery. Plain myelography was performed on 14 patients and showed focal ventral filling defects in nine. Results of CT myelography were equivalent to those of MR imaging with three pulse sequences (sagittal T1 and T2 weighted, axial T1 weighted) in the identification of all the abnormal levels. In two patients, the signal from the herniated disk was so low on all sequences that thoracic disk herniation had to be inferred from the mass effect on the spinal cord. Precise location of the abnormal level with body coil MR images was achieved in six of 13 patients.\r"

Three-dimensional reconstructions completely eliminated these problems. These 3D reconstructions accurately simulated oblique, inlet, and tangential views in all cases. In ten of 19 cases a nonconventional oblique view, and in 13 of 19 cases a cephalocaudal angulation other than the inlet, tangential, or anteroposterior view, best demonstrated the fracture. Elimination of five plain radiographs resulted in a skin radiation dose savings of 5 rad (50 mGy). No difficult or painful patient positioning was required beyond that necessary for the standard CT examination.\r"

The ability to differentiate between the two groups with MR imaging was evaluated. With the longer spin-echo repetition time, the image was variable in both groups. All malignant metastatic lesions appeared as low-intensity areas on T1-weighted images, but 50% of the nonneoplastic lesions also appeared this way. The mean T1 for group 1 was longer than that for group 2, but not significantly so. However, there were significant differences in the ratios of T1 to T2 and of the T1 ratio to the T2 ratio (T1 ratio = T1 for affected vertebrae/T1 for normal vertebrae, T2 ratio = T2 for affected vertebrae/T2 for normal vertebrae). These ratios were therefore useful in distinguishing malignant metastatic from nonneoplastic lesions.\r"

Although some deterioration in control was noted when it was inserted through a catheter in vivo, the new torque-control wire still exhibited a definite improvement over conventional wires in directional control.\r"

DNA stripped of its methylation by propagation in Escherichia coli was reintroduced into Neurospora crassa by transformation. The zeta-eta region reproducibly became \"properly\" methylated whether inserted at its native chromosomal position or at ectopic sites. Adjacent Neurospora and bacterial sequences in the transforming DNA rarely became methylated. A model is presented that accounts for position-independent faithful methylation as observed in the zeta-eta region, as well as position-dependent methylation, as occasionally observed, especially with sequences not native to Neurospora.\r"

The results showed that glycolysis was more effective than oxidative phosphorylation in preventing ATP-sensitive K+ channels from opening. Experiments in excised inside-out patches suggested that key glycolytic enzymes located in the membrane or adjacent cytoskeleton near the channels may account for their preference for glycolytic ATP.\r"

The significance of this new class of membrane anchor is unknown; one possibility is that it facilitates release of the molecule by phospholipases. In fact, phospholipase C enzymes specific for the complex carboxyl-terminal glycolipids of these proteins have been isolated from African trypanosomes and from hepatocyte plasma membranes. This study reports the discovery of a glycan-PI-specific phospholipase D in human serum that cleaves both the membrane form of the variant surface glycoprotein of African trypanosomes and its glycolipid precursor, but not phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylinositol. Decay-accelerating factor, another PI-anchored molecule, is also cleaved by the enzyme and converted from a hydrophobic to a soluble protein. The enzyme is Ca2+-dependent, heat labile, and not affected by the inhibitor of serine proteases, phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Its function is not known, but the present findings indicate that it participates in the metabolism of glycolipid-anchored membrane proteins.\r"

For analyses where there was a well-defined answer, such as a search for a restriction site, there were few significant differences between the program sets. However, for tasks in which a degree of flexibility is desirable, such as homology or similarity determinations and database searches, DNASTAR consistently afforded the user more options in conducting the required analysis than did the other two packages. However, for laboratories where sequence analysis is not a major effort and the expense of a full sequence analysis workstation cannot be justified, MicroGenie and IBI-Pustell offer a satisfactory alternative. MicroGenie is a polished program system. Many may find that its user interface is more \"user friendly\" than the standard menu-driven interfaces. Its system of filing sequences under individual passwords facilitates use by more than one person. MicroGenie uses a hardware device for software protection that occupies a card slot in the computer on which it is used. Although I am sympathetic to the problem of software piracy, I feel that a less drastic solution is in order for a program likely to be sharing limited computer space with other software packages. The IBI-Pustell package performs the required analysis functions as accurately and quickly as MicroGenie but it lacks the clearness and ease of use. The menu system seems disjointed, and new or infrequent users often find themselves at apparent \"dead-end menus\" where the only clear alternative is to restart the entire program package. It is suggested from published accounts that the user interface is going to be upgraded and perhaps when that version is available, use of the system will be improved. The documentation accompanying each package was relatively clear as to how to run the programs, but all three packages assumed that the user was familiar with the computational techniques employed. MicroGenie and IBI-Pustell further complicated their documentation by mixing instructions for the version based on floppy disk operation with that for the hard disk version.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Second, RFLPs of autosomes were used as clonal markers to detect the somatic loss or gain of specific chromosomal sequences in colorectal tumors. Among other changes, it was found that somatic loss of chromosome 17p sequences occurred in over 75 percent of the carcinomas examined, but such loss was rare in adenomas.

Clones were detected with inserts coding for different dermorphin precursors. The predicted amino acid sequences of these precursors contained homologous repeats of 35 amino acids that included one copy of the heptapeptide dermorphin. In these cloned cDNAs, the alanine codon GCG occurred at the position where D-alanine is present in the end product. This suggests the existence of a novel post-translational reaction for the conversion of an L-amino acid to its D-isomer.\r"

Transforming oncogenes of the ras family were capable of converting fibroblast cell lines to fully metastatic tumors. Cell lines transformed by the kinase oncogenes mos, raf, src, fes, and fms formed experimental metastases and (in some cases) these genes were more efficient at metastatic conversion than a mutant ras gene. In contrast, cells transformed by either of two nuclear oncogenes, myc or p53, were tumorigenic when injected subcutaneously but were virtually nonmetastatic after intravenous injection. These data demonstrate that, in addition to ras, a structurally divergent group of kinase oncogenes can induce the metastatic phenotype.\r"

The molecular defect of alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede, as revealed by sequencing of cloned genomic DNA fragments, consists of an alanine insertion near the active site region of the molecule. Substitution of this fragment into complementary DNA for a wild-type alpha 2-antiplasmin yields a translation product with physical and functional properties typical of the abnormal alpha 2-antiplasmin Enschede.

This precise spatiotemporal mapping occurs despite great variability in retinal position and conduction velocity even among retinal ganglion cells of the same physiological class-a variability that would seem to reduce the precision with which spatiotemporal information can be transmitted to central visual areas. There was a strong negative relation between the intraretinal and extraretinal conduction time for axons of individual ganglion cells of the X-cell class. The effect of this relation was to produce a nearly constant total transmission time between the soma of a retinal X cell and its central target site. Thus, the variation in the conduction velocities of retinal ganglion cell axons may ensure that, regardless of the constraints imposed by retinal topography, a precise spatiotemporal central representation of the retinal image is maintained.\r"

The carboxyl-terminal Ile2152 of apoB-48 purified from chylous ascites fluid has apparently been cleaved from the initial translation product, leaving Met2151 as the new carboxyl-terminus. These data indicate that approximately 85% of the intestinal mRNAs terminate within approximately 0.1 to 1.0 kilobase downstream from the stop codon. The other approximately 15% have lengths similar to hepatic apoB-100 mRNA even though they have the same in-frame stop codon. The organ-specific introduction of a stop codon to a mRNA appears unprecedented and might have implications for cryptic polyadenylation signal recognition and RNA processing.\r"

Line-shape changes and frequency shifts in this spectral band are generated by ligand recombination and are shown not to be the result of structural relaxation below 60 K. The observation of dynamic hole burning exposes the relation between the structural disorder responsible for the inhomogeneous broadening and the well-known distributed ligand rebinding kinetics. The findings provide direct evidence for the functional relevance of conformational substrates in myoglobin rebinding. In addition, a general protocol for evaluating the relative contributions of structural relaxation and hole burning to the spectral changes accompanying rebinding in hemeproteins is presented.\r"

In principle, the method is especially advantageous for biological samples if x-rays in the wavelength region between the carbon and oxygen K edges are used. However, until now the achieved resolution has not exceeded that of the light microscope because of the poor coherence properties of the x-ray sources and the low resolution of the detectors that were available. With a recently developed x-ray source based on an undulator on an electron storage ring, and high resolution x-ray resist, a hologram has been recorded at about 400-angstrom resolution. The experiment utilized x-rays with wavelengths of 24.7 angstroms and required a 1-hour exposure of the pancreatic zymogen granules under study.\r"

Large dextrans (molecular weight of 40,000 or more) were excluded from condensed mitotic chromosomes and from newly formed, postmitotic interphase nuclei. Therefore, postmitotic reassembly of the nucleus as a compartment distinct from cytoplasm occurs by exclusion not only of organelles but also of soluble macromolecules. This might occur by exclusion of macromolecules from condensed chromatin throughout mitosis and completion of nuclear envelope assembly before nuclear expansion.\r"

A \"hassle index\" identified three dimensions of vexation in practice: problems with running a practice, medical conditions of patients, and social characteristics of patients. In general, hassle was found to be dependent on the type of practice, but physicians were equally annoyed by unlikeable patients irrespective of their practice site. Diagnostic errors made by resident physicians from various clinics were more related to an unlikeable medical disorder than to differences in the clinics. To clarify doctors' negative feelings toward patients, a questionnaire measuring antipathy toward specific patient types was administered to physicians. Responses indicated that physicians' antipathy was unrelated to the doctors' ethical beliefs and their medicopolitical orientation. Personality variables indicative of \"extremeness\" of opinion about patients included high needs for dominance, low needs for nurturance and \"intraception\" (the ability to analyze the behavior and motives of others), and low self-esteem. Personality profiles of physicians least vexed by medical practice reflected less psychopathology--less self-derogation, less need for emotional support, and more extroversion. Medical College Aptitude Test scores revealed that high science scores were associated with extremeness of opinion, and low scores on general information were indicative of increased susceptibility to the daily irritations of medical practice.\r"

Duration of symptoms before diagnosis was 17 months in patients with benign disease and 18 days in those with malignant disease. Presence of symptoms for less than four weeks was associated with a high likelihood of malignancy. Invasive diagnostic procedures established a diagnosis in 33 patients, and no procedural complications occurred. Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest confirmed superior vena cava obstruction and localized the level of obstruction in all six patients in whom it was done. Information gained from venacavograms did not alter therapeutic decisions. In eight patients, establishment of a definitive histologic diagnosis altered the treatment. Treatment relieved the symptoms in 69% of the patients with malignant superior vena cava syndrome, and no patient had recurrent symptoms after therapy.\r"

In 126 a conventional ileostomy was converted to a continent intestinal reservoir, 38 at the time of coloproctectomy. Six had an unsatisfactory ileoanal or ileorectal anastomosis initially, and 26 (15%) required revisional surgery for problems involving the reservoir or valve. The incidence of valve slippage was 3%. Eighty-five percent achieved a normally functioning small bowel reservoir with one operation, and 19 more patients were added with one additional operation, for an ultimate good result of 96% with two operations at most. The average reservoir capacity is 400 ml, and most patients empty the pouch two or three times per day. Under favorable circumstances, the continent intestinal reservoir is preferable for most patients after coloproctectomy.\r"

Ninety-two percent of persons have angles greater than 3 degrees in flexion. A V-shaped predens space is not indicative of injury to the cruciate ligament. Virtually every person has posterior slanting or tilting of the dens and the range of values is up to 35 degrees (mean 17.43 degrees). Ninety-eight percent of persons have an angle greater than 6 degrees. A tilted dens does not indicate acute or remote trauma. No relationship was identified between the predens angle and the dens tilt angle. The posterior arch of the atlas can be found at any position between the occiput and spinous process of C2 in all positions of the head and neck. Hence, fanning or widening of the C1-C2 interspinous distance is not a reliable index of ligamentous injury in the upper cervical spine.\r"

Curve magnitude was found to be the most influential parameter governing the stability of a scoliotic curve up to 30 degrees.

The highest frequency of compression was at the T8-10 level, the right greater splanchnic nerve being the structure most frequently involved. The sympathetic trunk itself (ganglia and cord) was affected only by osteophytes of vertebrae at the lowest thoracic levels; however, bony excrescences due to costovertebral joint arthritis were frequently found impinging on the sympathetic trunk and its rami communicantes at similar frequencies on both sides. The factors governing the characteristic compression of the sympathetic structures in the thorax are the typical development of the osteophytes and the special relations of the sympathetic structures to the vertebral column at the various levels. It is proposed that these observations are useful in understanding certain observed clinical conditions and act an anatomic baseline for research in the future.\r"

All patients in this series had a minimum follow-up of 12 months. This new instrumentation is a posterior intrapedicular system developed by Dick in 1982. It allows stable fixation that is limited only to adjacent spinal segments. The internal fixator permits reduction in all three planes. Independently, it is possible to add distraction or compression to the involved segments. It also is able to reduce effectively the \"middle column\" which is thought to be accomplished by \"ligamentotaxis.\" In this series there were 16 neurologically intact patients and 14 with partial or complete neurologic injury. There were two minor instrumentation loosenings early in the series. Most patients in this series had a near-anatomic reduction of all three columns in the involved segment. It was also possible to re-establish the normal lordosis of the lumbar spine. The device provided sufficient rigid fixation for rapid postoperative mobilization in a light external orthosis.\r"

Subjective measures of disability were obtained by Oswestry patient questionnaires. Oswestry disability score related significantly (P less than 0.001) to presence or absence of relaxation in back muscles during flexion. Mean trunk strength ratios were inversely related to disability score (P less than .05), and trunk mobility was meaningfully reduced (P less than .01). Despite loss of motion, a large enough excursion was observed to predict presence of back muscle relaxation. These findings imply that myoelectric signal levels, trunk strength ratios, and ranges of trunk motion may be used as objective indicators of low-back pain disability.\r"

Body height was measured before and immediately after vibration or sitting exposure and the measurements were repeated at different intervals up to 2 hours after the experiment. Results show that exposure to vibration increases the overall creep response in most subjects. There is a great deal of variability in response between subjects, but most of them show a recovery to the average creep response within a 2-hour time interval.\r"

The Knodt system was effective at limiting extension but less effective in limiting flexion. The interfacet screws were effective at limiting flexion but less effective at limiting extension. Harrington rods to the sacral alae were the least effective system in both directions. Sublaminar wires did little to improve their performance.\r"

The incidence of headache, the most frequent side effect, was almost the same in patients who had corticosteroids in their premedication (30%) as in patients without (35%).

Accurate diagnosis of foraminal or extraforaminal herniation was made with disco-CT in 15 of 16 cases (93.8%), compared with discography alone (37.5%), computed tomography alone, and/or myelography-enhanced computed tomography (50%) and myelography alone (12.5%). Surgical treatment with bilateral hemilaminectomy, partial medial facetectomy, and partial internal foraminotomy, if needed, followed by discectomy is very effective and the favored surgical management for nerve root decompression in most all cases.\r"

This study was done to determine whether or not hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide ion (O2) are responsible for cardiac injury from hemorrhagic shock as indicated by reduced coronary perfusion and impaired contractile function. This hypothesis was tested by infusing selective O2 and H2O2 scavengers into anesthetized dogs in a state of shock, either during shock (group 3) or with fluid resuscitation (group 2) and comparing the cardiovascular response to that seen with shock and fluid resuscitation alone (group 1). We found no significant difference in shock induced derangements in myocardial oxygen metabolism or the degree of myocardial depression and regional ischemia in dogs in a state of shock given superoxide dismutase plus catalase, compared with shock alone. The results of our data suggested that, if O2 and H2O2 play a causative role in shock induced cardiac dysfunction or during reperfusion after shock, free radical scavengers must be administered early in the ischemic period. Furthermore, free radical scavengers administered with reperfusion do not enchance cardiac function nor myocardial perfusion.\r"

The mean age of the patients at operation was 22.4 years (a range of seven to 56 years). All of the patients had a two stage operation with temporary ileostomy. Five had an S-shaped reservoir (SR), one patient had a J-shaped reservoir (JR), 12 patients had no reservoir (NR), 97 had a lateral reservoir with the reservoir constructed at the second operation (LR-2) and 30 had a lateral reservoir constructed at the first operation (LR-1). The most common complications were reservoir inflammation, obstruction of the reservoir outlet, stricture of the ileoanal anastomosis, superficial wound infection and sinus tracts extending upward between the rectal muscle cuff and the pull-through segment of ileum. Forty-four patients underwent reoperation for one or more of the complications. Reoperation was performed upon 60 per cent of the patients with SR, 36 per cent with LR-2, 10 per cent with LR-1 and 17 per cent with NR. Of the reoperations, 33 were performed upon the first 50 patients. Only 11 of the last 95 patients required a corrective operation. Of the last 95 patients, 97.5 per cent are currently functioning well. Important features of the operative technique include using a short rectal muscle cuff (5 centimeters or less), constructing a short reservoir (less than 15 centimeters) and having a short reservoir spout (less than 2 centimeters). Although a reservoir reduces fecal urgency and frequency in most instances, patients with obesity, anorectal muscle spasm, severe rectal disease and thick mesentery may be best treated with no reservoir. In our experience, the LR-1 procedure is technically easy to construct, has a low incidence of complications and is the preferred technique.\r"

The operative method, which emphasizes visualization and preservation of the parathyroid glands and their blood supply, as well as exposure of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, is discussed in detail. Permanent hypoparathyroidism was a complication in six patients (3.3 per cent). Permanent nerve injury occurred in one patient (0.55 per cent). Postoperatively, 78 patients had radioactive iodine uptake studies to evaluate the amount of residual thyroid tissue in the neck. Sixty-four (82 per cent) had 24 hour uptake studies of less than 2 per cent and 52 had an uptake of less than 1 per cent. Although a careful and consistent technique of total thyroidectomy substantially reduces the danger of permanent hypocalcemia, we experienced this complication sporadically. Since no operative technique completely removes the danger of permanent hypoparathyroidism, it is our opinion that total thyroidectomy should not be the standard management for carcinoma of the thyroid gland. It is best reserved for those patients in whom the extent of disease or the aggressiveness of the histologic cell type warrants the increased risk.\r"

To test this hypothesis, we compared patients having nosocomial enterococcal pulmonary and wound infections with those patients having nosocomial staphylococcal infections for antecedant cephalosporin use. In a six month period, we found 14 instances of nosocomial enterococcal wound and respiratory infections; 13 were superinfections (occurring during or up to one week after administration of antimicrobials). Seven had coexisting pathogens noted. In the same six month period, 30 instances of Staphylococcus aureus nosocomial respiratory tract and wound infections were found and only 13 were superinfections (p less than 0.002 compared with enterococcal superinfections). Nine had coexisting pathogens noted. The mean age, gender distribution and underlying illnesses in the Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcal superinfection groups were comparable. Of the 14 instances of enterococcal nosocomial infections, 11 were associated with administration of a cephalosporin compared with seven of 30 for staphylococcal infections (p less than 0.002). Nosocomial enterococcal infections are commonly associated with antimicrobial therapy and the use of cephalosporins may selectively predispose patients to increased risk of enterococcal superinfections.\r"

The results obtained showed an abundance of immunoreactive secretory granules in the tumor cells, a paucity in the electron microscopic images suggesting exocytosis of secretory granules, and no significant changes in the volume density of rough endoplasmic reticulum when compared with untreated (control) tumor cells. These findings strongly suggest that the effects of short-term bromocriptine treatment for lowering serum prolactin levels did not inhibit protein and secretory granule synthesis but rather caused a disturbance in the secretion of prolactin granules. The present morphometrical data suggest the possibility that a reduction in the number of cytoplasmic microtubules might be related to the disturbance of prolactin secretion.\r"

Graded distal aortic hypotension to 40 mmHg in seven animals had no significant effect upon the evoked potential. A significant alteration in the SEP did result in 21 +/- 9.8 minutes when distal aortic pressures were reduced in a graded fashion below 30 mmHg. Acute occlusion of the thoracic aorta (10 animals, distal pressure 15-25 mmHg) was associated with a change in the SEP in 8.4 +/- 4.3 minutes. Continuation of aortic occlusion for 30 minutes beyond an evoked potential change resulted in a moderate to severe motor deficit in all cases. Somatosensory evoked potentials obtained 72-96 hours after the ischemic injury were closely correlated with sensory deficits, but were not predictive of motor examination. Histologic examination of the spinal cords demonstrated central gray necrosis of the lumbar region in all animals with a severe deficit, and a variable degree of neuronal loss in the intermediate and dorsal gray matter zones in animals with moderate deficits. This balloon occlusion method is relevant as a model of spinal cord injury during aortic occlusion, such as may occur during aortic surgery.\r"

Fifteen patients (median age: 35 years) underwent W pouch reconstruction after proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis and familial adenomatous polyposis. Follow-up on each patient averaged 14 months (range: 6 to 24 months). All procedures were performed without death and with minimal morbidity. Assessment of functional results showed 24-hour stool frequency (mean +/- SEM) decreasing from 6.0 +/- 0.39 initially to 4.8 +/- 0.43 at 1 year (p less than 0.005). Night evacuation decreased from 1.1 +/- 0.2 at 1 month after surgery to 0.25 +/- 0.12 at 1 year (p less than 0.025), with 10 of 15 patients having no nocturnal pouch evacuation. Continence was excellent in all patients with the exception of three of 15 patients who had occasional minimal nighttime seepage. Pouch volume determined at surgery by saline solution infusion was 200 +/- 21 ml. Pouch volume and compliance (pressure/volume) were measured before ileostomy closure and at 6 months after surgery via a special pressure-monitored balloon catheter. Maximal pouch volume increased from 190 +/- 21 ml (at time of ileostomy takedown) to 470 +/- 85 ml at 6 months. Ileal reservoir construction with a W pouch design resulted in a low 24-hour and nighttime stool frequency and excellent compliance and evacuation characteristics.\r"

Indications were gastroesophageal reflux in 32 patients, advanced motility disorders in eight, esophageal perforation in six, and strictures not related to reflux in seven. There were two operative deaths (3.8%). Fourteen other patients (26.4%) had 18 major complications including three graft infarcts, two graft perforations, and four anastomotic leaks, one of which required surgical treatment. Follow-up was complete in 83% of patients and averaged 5 years. Eight patients required dilations; and 15 underwent late reoperations for stricture, persistent symptoms, or anastomotic leak. Of the 20 patients who did not have pyloroplasty done at the initial resection, five (25%) required a subsequent gastric emptying procedure. Results were rated by patients (subjectively) and physicians (objectively, based on symptoms and the need for further therapy) as 1 = excellent, 2 = good, 3 = fair, and 4 = poor. The patients' ratings averaged 1.89, with 27 patients (75%) claiming good or excellent results despite symptoms of postprandial fullness in 78% and dysphagia in 42%. Objective ratings averaged 2.05, with 28 of 39 patients (72%) rating the results as excellent or good. Despite a 30% major complication rate and a 37% late reoperative rate, colon interposition for benign esophageal disease can be accomplished with low mortality and high patient acceptance and remains our preferred technique for reconstruction of benign esophageal disease.\r"

The test population underwent esophagoscopy, standard acid reflux test, 24-hour pH monitoring, and manometry of the lower esophageal sphincter. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the accuracy of the tests and test combinations were calculated. Esophagoscopy had a sensitivity of 62%, that is, only 62% of patients with the disease have evidence of mucosal damage on endoscopy. Manometric measurements of the lower esophageal sphincter had a sensitivity of 84%, a specificity of 89%, and an accuracy of 87%. Twenty-four hour esophageal pH monitoring had a sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96%. The results show that 24-hour pH monitoring can detect gastroesophageal reflux disease with an accuracy of 96% by measuring an increase in esophageal acid exposure. Manometry of the lower esophageal sphincter can detect a mechanically deficient sphincter as a cause of the disease with an accuracy of 87%. The test combination of 24-hour monitoring and motility studies can select patients with an accuracy of 91% who have an increase in esophageal exposure to gastric juice because of a deficient cardia. Antireflux surgery is designed to reduce esophageal exposure to gastric juice in patients with a deficient sphincter by creating a mechanical antireflux mechanism at the cardia. Therefore it is necessary to determine the mechanical status of the sphincter with manometry before surgery in such patients. Thus the indications for antireflux surgery are (1) uncontrolled symptoms of increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice; (2) a documented increase in esophageal exposure to gastric juice by 24-hour pH monitoring; and (3) a mechanically defective sphincter on motility with a pressure of 6 mm Hg or less, an overall length of 2 cm or less, and an abdominal length of 1 cm or less.\r"

A multidisciplinary approach (surgeon, neurologist, and anesthesiologist), as well as local blocks of the ilioinguinal nerve and/or paravertebral blocks of L-1 and L-2 (genitofemoral nerve), were essential to determine accurately which nerve was specifically involved. Fifteen of the 17 patients (88%) diagnosed as having ilioinguinal neuralgia after previous inguinal herniorrhaphy are pain free after resection of the entrapped portion of the nerve. Thirteen patients were diagnosed as having genitofemoral neuralgia after previous inguinal herniorrhaphy, blunt abdominal trauma, or other surgery. Neurectomy of the genitofemoral nerve proximal to the entrapment controlled the persistent pain in 10 of 13 (77%) of these patients. Ilioinguinal or genitofemoral nerve entrapment neuralgias are rare complications of surgery in the inguinal region.

Ninety-six rats were equally divided into sham-operated, vagotomy, atropine-treated, and cimetidine-treated groups. Each group was subdivided into stressed (cold-restraint) and nonstressed cells. Gastric mucosal injury was graded, and duodenal mucosa was processed for determination of prostaglandin content. Results included: (1) significant increases in duodenal mucosal prostaglandins in all experimental groups compared with sham-operated controls, (2) decreases in duodenal mucosal prostaglandin content associated with stress in all groups, and (3) significantly less gastric mucosal injury in all stressed, experimentally treated rats compared with sham-operated animals. These results demonstrate that attenuation of gastric acid-secretion, achieved either surgically or pharmacologically and proved by decrease in stress gastric injury, is associated with an increase in the content of duodenal mucosal prostaglandins. Such augmentation of mucosal prostaglandins could account for, along with the direct acid-lowering effect of vagotomy, the success of truncal vagotomy in the surgical cure of duodenal ulcer disease.\r"

MRI correctly diagnosed patent shunts in all seven patients. A marked decrease in the size of intrahepatic veins after a total or nonselective shunt suggests adequate portal vein and variceal decompression.

Eighty-one patients were analyzed in two groups depending on duodenal patency. Forty-five patients (group I) had no evidence of duodenal obstruction. Thirty-six patients (group II) had evidence of impingement on the duodenum by the pancreatic cancer. A third subset of patients was also studied for outcome. These 21 patients (five group I and 16 group II) had nausea and vomiting as major symptoms and were judged to have the most to gain from gastrojejunostomy. Patients were categorized by outcome. Poor outcome was defined as either death during the hospitalization for gastrojejunostomy or death within 30 days of operation even if the patient left the hospital. Risk for poor outcome depended on group. In group I, 18 of 45 patients (40%) had a poor outcome compared with 25 of 36 (70%) patients in group II (p less than 0.001). Nineteen of the 21 (90%) patients with nausea and vomiting had a poor outcome. It is an unfortunate paradox that the more patients need gastrojejunostomy for pancreatic cancer, the less likely they are to have a favorable outcome. Gastric outlet obstruction in pancreatic cancer appears to be a terminal event. A prospective study is needed to see if any true palliation of vomiting can be affected in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The surgical challenge of resection of renal cell carcinoma with vena caval invasion may require close cooperation between the urologist and cardiovascular surgeon. From 1977 to 1986, 13 patients with renal cell carcinoma and tumor thrombus invading the inferior vena cava (IVC) underwent radical surgical resection. In three of 13 patients the thrombus extended into the heart (right atrium two patients and right ventricle one patient). The tumor originated in the right kidney in 10 patients and in the left kidney in three patients. There were 10 men and three women with a mean age of 64 years (range, 46 to 75 years). Surgical management included midline incision, seven, with median sternotomy, four, and thoracoabdominal, two. After exposure of the renal vessels and IVC, all patients underwent radical nephrectomy. Two patients had caval sleeve resection, one had a partial caval resection, and seven had a 1 cm caval cuff. Planned cardiopulmonary bypass was used in three patients. The tumor thrombus was extracted by simultaneous atrial and caval approaches. One patient underwent unplanned emergency cardiopulmonary bypass after intraoperative cardiac arrest caused by a large tumor embolus of the pulmonary artery. No operative deaths occurred. Postoperative morbidity was significant in five of 13 patients, caval thrombosis in one, lower limb swelling in two, renal failure in one, and pulmonary edema in one patient. Two patients required long-term anticoagulation therapy for confirmed pulmonary emboli within 1 month of surgery. These complications resolved. The follow-up period ranged from 7 to 64 months with a mean of 36 months. Two patients died of metastatic disease at 24 and 48 months after surgery. Three patients are alive with metastatic disease at 6 to 64 months while one patient had a solitary metastatic lesion removed from the frontal lobe 4 years after nephrectomy and has been disease free a subsequent 18 months. Eight of 11 patients are disease free at 7 to 64 months (four patients greater than 52 months). Our 83% survival rate at a mean follow-up of 36 months suggests that this group of patients should not be denied aggressive resection. Documentation of tumor source and caval extension are essential to plan operative procedures, including use of cardiopulmonary bypass.\r"

In 28 patients, the corresponding primary carcinoma of the metastases was also studied. Tumor clinicopathology and clinical course of the patients were reviewed. Preparation of paraffin-embedded tissue specimens was performed by the technique of Hedley et al. and stained with propidium iodide according to the method of Vindelov et al. Eighty-eight of 101 metastatic tumors and 26 of 28 primary tumors yielded evaluable DNA histograms. Twenty-six metastases showed a DNA diploid pattern, 25 showed a significantly increased 4C peak (DNA tetraploid/polyploid), and 37 had a DNA aneuploid peak. Ploidy pattern was constant between primary and metastases in 84.6% of tumors. No significant relationship between host and tumor characteristics and ploidy pattern was found except for a correlation between grade 3 metastases and DNA aneuploid. Survival of patients with DNA aneuploid metastases was significantly less than that of patients with DNA diploid metastases (p = 0.03). However, among DNA nondiploid metastases, survival was significantly less for low DNA index metastases (less than or equal to 1.5) than for high DNA index (greater than 1.5) metastases (p less than 0.05). Flow cytometric DNA ploidy measurements may have prognostic value for patients with resected hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "Among 1480 patients treated for cancers of the rectosigmoid over a 30-year period, 24 patients underwent total pelvic exenteration. These patients, 13 men and 11 women, had a median age of 64 years. Pathologic staging revealed 15 Dukes' B and nine Dukes' C lesions. For 17 patients, this operation was the only form of therapy. The operative mortality rate was 20.8%; however, the mortality rate has decreased to 13.3% during the past 20 years and to 9% in the past decade. Five complications occurred in the group surviving the procedure, resulting in a 26.3% morbidity rate. Three of the five complications occurred in patients who had previous radiation therapy or surgery. The overall 5-year survival rate was 41.6%. Those patients surviving the operation had 5- and 10-year survival rates of 52.6% and 31.5%, respectively. There were seven patients in whom the disease recurred at an average of 20.3 months after exenteration, and all died an average of 8 months later. The recurrence rate for patients with Dukes' B lesions was 27% compared with 57% for patients with Dukes' C lesions. The remaining 12 disease-free patients had a mean survival of 11 years. At present, four patients are alive and well 6 to 30 years after exenteration. The best predictor of morbidity was treatment before exenteration (p less than .005). Age older than 65 years and the presence of nodal metastases may contribute to increased mortality rates and recurrence, respectively, but these relationships were not statistically significant for the group. Total pelvic exenteration is advocated for selected primary, locally advanced, rectosigmoid lesions in good-risk patients; it can be achieved now with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates and a survival rate in excess of 40% at 5 years.\r"

Minimum follow-up was 24 months (mean 40 months). Postoperative staging based on histologic examination of the specimen of the lung and mediastinal lymphadenectomy categorized 59 patients in stage I, 28 in stage II, and 73 in stage III (20 T3N0, 12 T3N1, 29 T1 or T2N2, and 12 T3N2). The sensitivity rate of cervical mediastinoscopy for detection of mediastinal node metastasis was 48.7%. False-negative results of mediastinoscopy occurred in 21 of 41 patients with normal mediastinoscopy: unreachable nodes in eight patients, sampling error of reachable nodes in 11 patients, and error on frozen section in two patients. Eleven of 65 patients with clinical stage I disease and normal mediastinum on chest roentgenogram had mediastinal node involvement; only three were detected by mediastinoscopy, which resulted in a low sensitivity rate (27.3%) and a high rate of unnecessary mediastinoscopy (62/65 patients). The sensitivity of mediastinoscopy increased as the amount of disease present, as measured by the clinical stage of disease or positive gallium 67 scan of mediastinum, increased. Eleven of 29 patients with T1 to T2N2 disease discovered at mediastinoscopy had similar survival rates compared with 18 of 29 patients who had a normal mediastinoscopy examination and mediastinal node involvement discovered at thoracotomy.\r"

To provide such data we have evaluated two groups of patients undergoing aortic reconstruction: group I (n = 25), general anesthesia and group II (n = 6), general anesthesia with adjunctive epidural analgesia. The groups were comparable preoperatively as judged by the incidence of cardiac history, preoperative ejection fraction, and measured hemodynamic parameters. Postoperatively there were no significant differences in the pressure-related parameters; however, rate-related factors including heart rate and double product were significantly decreased in group II with no reduction in cardiac index. Postoperative increases in total body oxygen consumption were also markedly attenuated by epidural analgesia. Epidural analgesia reduces the hemodynamic demands on the heart after major surgery and is a useful adjunct, especially in patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

Symptoms on presentation included abdominal pain (80%), palpable mass (60%), rectal bleeding (53%), and lethargy or sepsis (45%). Fifteen children underwent exploration without contrast studies based on duration of symptoms (greater than 5 days) and evidence of severe obstruction on plain abdominal x-ray films. In the remaining children, diagnosis was confirmed by barium enema and hydrostatic reduction was achieved in only 34 patients (42% success rate). Symptoms were present more than 48 hours in 55% of the reduction failures. At operation, five children had spontaneously reduced and an appendectomy was performed. Manual reduction was possible in 32 patients. The intussusception was irreducible in 26 patients, and 18 required temporary stomas. Pathologic lead points were found in 11 patients. Average length of hospitalization was 1.5 days after barium enema reduction, 9.6 days after manual reduction, and 13.8 days after bowel resection. There were no recurrences of intussusception after surgical reduction. A significant morbidity rate was observed with a delay in diagnosis. Adequate preoperative preparation and prompt surgical intervention are associated with 100% survival.\r"

  ".W": "The records of 154 patients with 254 abdominal vascular injuries seen over 5 years (1980 to 1985) were reviewed. The overall mortality rate (MR) was 46%. This included 100% (5/5) for blunt injuries, 49% (59/119) for gunshot wounds, and 23% (7/30) for stab wounds. The most common venous injuries and the MRs were: inferior vena cava, 59% (33/56) and iliac veins, 65% (10/16). The most common arterial injuries and the MRs were: aorta, 68% (15/22), iliac artery, 57% (12/21), and superior mesenteric artery, 67% (8/12). Of 84 patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) with a blood pressure (BP) less than 70 mm Hg, 60 (71%) died, and of 64 patients with four or more associated injuries, 41 (64%) died. Failure to reduce the duration of shock, amount of bleeding, or severity of hypotension before surgery is highly lethal. Of the 42 patients who had shock for more than 30 minutes, 38 (90%) died. Of the 93 patients who received more than 10 U of blood in the ED and operating room (OR) 60 (64%) died. Of the 60 patients presenting to the OR with a systolic BP less than 70 mm Hg, 52 (87%) died. Prelaparotomy cross-clamping of the thoracic aorta for persistent shock is controversial. However, of the 26 patients with this procedure, 12 responded with a sustained increase in systolic BP greater than 90 with five (42%) survivors. Of the 14 no responders, none survived. Of 17 patients with persistent shock without a prelaparotomy thoracotomy, only one (6%) survived. In the high-risk group (admission systolic BP less than 70 mm Hg and four or more associated injuries), if shock was kept to less than 30 minutes and bleeding to 10 U of blood or less, the MR was reduced from 92% (24/26) to 0% (0/12). In patients presenting to the OR with a BP less than 70, a prelaparotomy cross-clamping of the aorta should be considered. In those patients not responding, prolonged surgical efforts are futile.\r"

A rabbit spinal ischemia model was used to test if glucose administration would increase neurologic deficit of the lower extremity. Rabbits (2 to 3 kg), anesthesized with halothane, had a snare occluder placed around the aorta just below the left renal artery. After a 2-hour recovery, the aorta was occluded for 15 minutes. Before occlusion animals received an intraperitoneal injection of isotonic glucose (2 gm/kg; n = 11), isotonic mannitol (2 gm/kg; n = 3), or an equal volume of saline solution (n = 11). Four sham-operated animals received glucose and an identical surgical procedure, but the aorta was not occluded. Average blood glucose level at the time of occlusion for the glucose group was 249 +/- 15 versus 156 +/- 6 for the control group (p less than 0.01). At 1, 4, 18, and 24 hours, a neurologic impairment score (1 = normal, 2 = partial impairment, 3 = complete impairment) was assigned. At 4, 18, and 24 hours, the glucose group had significantly greater neurologic impairment than did control groups (p less than 0.02). Glucose administration had an adverse effect in a controlled and highly reproducible model of spinal cord ischemia. Exogenous glucose administration should potentially be avoided during complex aortic reconstruction.\r"

  ".W": "This review compares the results and costs of carotid endarterectomy (CE) done by a single surgeon over a 1-year period working at both a university hospital (UH) and a community hospital (CH). Hospital and financial records of 157 patients were reviewed, 78 at UH and 79 at CH. The patient populations were matched for age, associated illnesses, and presenting symptoms. The principles of patient management were identical at both hospitals except that shunting requirements were determined by electroencephalographic monitoring at UH. There were no differences in the complication rates, and the combined stroke/mortality rate was 0.6%. The cost of CE was 56% greater on a per patient basis at UH ($3918 versus $6126, p less than 0.001) and 23% greater on a per diem basis at UH ($611 versus $755, p less than 0.001). Patients stayed longer at UH (8.2 days versus 6.6 days at CH, p less than 0.03). These differences are largely explained by three types of delays at UH. First, patients with cardiovascular accidents at UH were kept in the hospital before surgery until maximum improvement occurred whereas patients at CH were allowed to convalesce at home before CE. Patients operated on after a cardiovascular accident spent an average of 17.6 days in UH while a similar group spent only 7.3 days in hospital at CH (p less than 0.03). Second, delays in obtaining angiograms of greater than 2 hospital days occurred in 28% of patients at UH compared with only 10% at CH (p less than 0.05). Third, delays in scheduling operating room time of greater than 2 hospital days occurred in 17% of patients at UH and in only 7% of patients at CH (p less than 0.05). When there were no delays, the cost of treating patients at each hospital was identical, $3483 at CH and $3520 at UH. UH must accept the fact that equally good results can be obtained at CH, and although the potential exists for equal costs at both types of hospitals, the CH provides the service at a lower cost. UH administrators must address these inefficiences if the UH is to compete effectively in the current marketplace.\r"

Platlet count and duration of heparin administration were not useful in predicting the outcome of the heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome. Patients who received heparin in therapeutic doses were at higher risk for developing complications than were patients receiving lower doses of heparin. Platelet aggregation tests became negative as early as 7 days after discontinuation of heparin but persisted as long as 28 months. Heparin reexposure (2 days to 34 months after positive aggregation studies) was uneventful in 13 of 15 patients, whereas two patients suffered devastating thrombotic complications. Five patients continued to receive heparin despite positive platelet aggregation tests. The serious complications suffered by two of these five patients illustrate the necessity to discontinue heparin as soon as the diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is established.\r"

The subjects were monitored over a six week period comprising a control period (usual cigarette), a test period (test cigarette), and a return period (usual cigarette), each lasting two weeks. The inhaled smoke volume (smoke from the burning tip of the cigarette which is subsequently inhaled) was measured with a non-invasive radiotracer technique. Puffing indices were recorded using an electronic smoking analyser and flowhead cigarette holder. Measurements were made at the beginning of the control period, at the beginning and end of the test period, and at the end of the return period. Subjects kept records of their cigarette consumption during each of the three periods. Apart from a small change in puff duration, cigarettes were smoked in the same way during the control and return periods. Mean and total puff volumes increased with the low tar, low nicotine cigarette but did not change from the beginning to the end of the test period. There was no significant change between the control, test, and return periods for mean inhaled smoke volume, total inhaled smoke volume, or cigarette consumption. It is concluded that when smokers are switched to a low tar, low nicotine cigarette the puff volume increases but there is no change in the inhaled smoke volume or daily consumption.\r"

The first reported case was a village woman whose lung tissue contained amphibole asbestos fibres, which were later identified as tremolite. This began a search for the origin of her exposure to asbestos. Our studies have shown that tremolite is widespread, being found, along with chrysotile, in domestic and environmental dust samples. Other cases of mesothelioma have been diagnosed, and the pattern of their distribution suggests that the mine is not the major source of disease. Exposure to tremolite is equally, if not more, important.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty six patients previously treated for pulmonary tuberculosis by thoracoplasty were studied to determine the prevalence and effect of airflow obstruction. The mean (SD) FEV1 was 1.3 (0.65) 1 and the mean forced expiratory ratio (FER) 64% (12%). FEV1 was less than predicted in every patient whereas FER was less than predicted in 30, being below the lower 98th percentile in 15 (42%). In the 18 patients who complained of breathlessness the means of the standardised residuals (SR) for FEV1, peak expiratory flow (PEF), and FER were significantly lower and that for residual volume/total lung capacity (RV/TLC) significantly higher than those for the 18 patients who were not breathless (all p less than 0.0001). There was no difference in the smoking history of the two groups. Only three of the 23 patients in whom reversibility of airflow obstruction was assessed showed a greater than 25% increase in PEF. None showed an increase in FEV1 of greater than 15%. The 18 who were breathless had significantly lower values of arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) and higher values of arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) (p less than 0.0001). Thirteen of these patients were in chronic respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 8.0 kPa or PaCO2 greater than 5.9 kPa, or both) compared with only one of the 18 who were not breathless. The indices correlating best with PaO2 and PaCO2 were SR FEV1 and SR PEF respectively. SR FEV1 accounted for 34% of the variance in PaO2 and SR PEF for 29% of the variance in PaCO2. Airflow obstruction has been found to be common in patients with a thoracoplasty and to be associated with hypoxia and hypercapnia.\r"

Mean and minimum SaO2 during sleep were significantly related to each other and to daytime oxygenation but not to lung mechanics. Although the maximum fall in SaO2 during sleep was similar to the fall during maximum exercise (a level seldom achieved during normal daily activities), profound hypoxaemic episodes during sleep were rare and brief and therefore contributed little to the mean SaO2. The fall in mean SaO2 during sleep was not significant and was considerably less than during moderate exercise (average 0.5 v an estimated 4.5%, p less than 0.05). It is therefore concluded that in patients with interstitial lung disease oxygen desaturation during sleep is mild and less severe than hypoxaemia during exercise.\r"

Data were obtained from 916 subjects. Of these, 876 underwent a histamine inhalation test and bronchial hyperresponsiveness to histamine (defined as a dose of histamine provoking a 20% fall in FEV1 equal to or less than 3.9 mumol) was found in 10.5%. Another 40 subjects with poor lung function were tested with a bronchodilator and 12 were found to have bronchial hyperresponsiveness (defined as a greater than 15% increase in FEV1), making the total prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness 11.4%. The prevalence of current asthma, defined as bronchial hyperresponsiveness plus symptoms consistent with asthma in the last 12 months, was 5.9%. The distribution of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the studied population was continuous. There was a significant association between it and respiratory symptoms, atopy, smoking, and abnormal lung function (p less than 0.001 for all associations).

The data show that the peripheral conducting airways are relatively large in diameter at 1-3 months, attaining their adult proportion after one year. In contrast, length ratio shows no trend with age. On the assumption of 25,000 terminal bronchioles, the mean number of orders between terminal bronchiole and trachea was estimated to be about 12.\r"

Twenty five cases have been analysed, by a method whereby each anatomical component is separately considered. All 25 patients had abnormalities of the tracheobronchial tree, with no connection to the abnormal segment in nine cases. The aberrant arterial blood supply was single in 16 cases and multiple in nine cases, one patient from the latter group having a mixed pulmonary and systemic arterial supply to a part of the abnormal segment. Seventeen patients had anomalous venous drainage. In nine of these the vein or veins (they were multiple in four cases) drained the major part or the whole of the lung, whereas the aberrant arterial supply was limited to the right lower zone--that is, mismatched anomalous venous drainage. Abnormalities of lung parenchyma included changes within the lesion (for example, cysts, foregut inclusions) and associated abnormalities of surrounding lung (for example, hypoplasia, abnormal lobation). This information, together with the clinical features and haemodynamic data, was found to be essential for decisions on appropriate management. Patients presenting in infancy with haemodynamic disturbance continue to present major management problems (50% mortality), particularly if there are associated congenital heart defects. The role of aberrant systemic artery occlusion or ligation as a first stage procedure is well established in patients with haemodynamic abnormalities. There may be a place for this procedure in selected patients who have no haemodynamic disturbance at presentation.\r"

It affected the sexes equally and occurred more frequently in the indigenous Manx population. Thirty eight cases (39.6%) had been in contact with the disease before diagnosis, compared with two (1.2%) of the combined controls. These contacts included members of the same household, colleagues at work, and close friends. A bias may have been introduced as patients would inevitably be more aware of the disease and be more likely to mention previous contact than the controls.

The improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF) ranged from 26% to 512%. The three patients who did not respond were immediately given other treatments but died in hospital. The remaining seven patients were not in severe respiratory distress and were treated electively; all were thought to have benefited from their treatment, the mean increase in PEF being 36%. The improvement obtained in the 11 patients who responded to emergency laser treatment provided time in which to assess the disease carefully and plan the most appropriate longer term management with surgery, radiotherapy, tracheal stenting, or repeat laser treatment. The patients who were treated electively have either not required further treatment of have been managed with repeat laser treatments alone. Laser treatment provides an excellent method of resuscitating patients with life threatening tracheal obstruction and enables subsequent management to be carefully planned. In some cases this longer term management should be with further laser treatment alone.\r"

Thirteen (8%) could not be traced, 65 (38%) had died, and 93 (54%) were alive. For those who were traced the survival at 10, 20, and 30 years from the date of operation was 93%, 79%, and 65%. This represents a significantly greater mortality rate than that predicted from the Registrar General's review of deaths in England and Wales (1841-1984). Nineteen patients died from cardiorespiratory failure. Eight of the survivors are known to have developed respiratory failure, five having enjoyed apparently good health before this was precipitated by intercurrent illness or drugs. A stepwise logistic regression analysis using information from the 124 patients for whom full details were available showed significant associations between the development of cardiorespiratory or respiratory failure and a preoperative contralateral artificial pneumothorax, older age at operation, the presence of cavities before operation, and male sex. In a questionnaire 50 of the survivors (57% of those who replied) reported cough, 45 (51%) breathlessness, 41 (47%) wheeze, and 24 (27%) ankle swelling. Nineteen (22%) smoke and the same number now attend a chest clinic. Many patients treated for tuberculosis by thoracoplasty have respiratory symptoms and some are at risk of respiratory failure.

The distribution of aerosols (labelled with technetium-99m diethylene triamine pentacetic acid) of two different particle sizes has been studied by gamma camera imaging. The particles had mass median aerodynamic diameters (geometric standard deviations) of 1.4 (1.4) and 5.5 (2.3) micron, and they were administered from a jet nebuliser to eight patients with chronic severe stable asthma. There was no significant difference in peripheral lung deposition with the two aerosols in any patient. The bronchodilator effect of the two aerosols was determined from cumulative dose-response studies. To avoid large doses that might mask possible differences in effect due to aerosol size, small, precisely determined incremental amounts of salbutamol (25-250 micrograms total lung dose) were used. The two doses were given via a nebuliser on separate occasions and the bronchodilator response was measured from FEV1, forced vital capacity, and peak expiratory flow 30 minutes after each dose. Bronchodilatation was similar with the two aerosols at each dose of salbutamol. There was therefore no difference in distribution within the lung or any difference in bronchodilator effect between an aerosol of small (1.4 micron) particle size and an aerosol of 5.5 microns in patients with severe but stable asthma.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients with inoperable carcinoma in the trachea or a main bronchus were investigated before and one and 10 days after treatment with a carbon dioxide laser. Patients were assessed by spirometry, maximum flow-volume loops, and a visual analogue score of breathlessness on a scale from 0 (not at all breathless) to 100 (very breathless). At day 10 mean FEV1 had improved from 51.9% to 62.6% of predicted (p less than 0.02) and mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) from 45.3% to 53.1% of the predicted value (p less than 0.05). Improvements in maximum inspiratory and expiratory flows at 50% vital capacity were not significant but the breathlessness score decreased from a mean of 49.1 to 35.3 (p less than 0.01). Improvements in breathlessness were significantly correlated with increases in FEV1 and PEF. Thirteen of the 20 patients had unilateral tumours with partial or complete occlusion of the main bronchus; in these perfusion and ventilation were assessed by radioisotope scans before and 10 days after treatment. Seven of the 13 patients showed an increase in perfusion of the affected lung after treatment but the improvement was small, with a mean increase in unilateral perfusion in the 13 patients of 2.4% of the total counts. Four patients with no perfusion of the affected side showed no significant improvement after laser treatment. Changes in ventilation scans were similar to those in perfusion. It is concluded that laser treatment improves airway function and dyspnoea in malignant narrowing of central airways and that in unilateral obstruction such treatment results, at best, in a small increase in the contribution of the affected lung to perfusion.\r"

All seven individuals had had substantial exposure, ranging from two to 25 years, and chronic chest problems and at necropsy all cases met the criteria for compensatable disease. Macroscopically, all had extensive visceral pleural fibrosis and extensive areas of adhesions, and four also had discrete parietal pleural plaques. The histological features were similar in all the cases--most strikingly the basket weave pattern of the thickened pleura and a dense subpleural parenchymal interstitial fibrosis with fine honeycombing, extending up to 1 cm into the underlying lung. The similar histological appearances raise the possibility that diffuse pleural fibrosis and pleural plaques have a similar pathogenesis. Amphibole asbestos (crocidolite and amosite) counts were high in six of the seven cases and chrysotile counts in four; four cases had high mullite counts, but the importance of this is not known. It is concluded that diffuse pleural fibrosis is a specific asbestos associated entity, of uncertain pathogenesis, with mineral fibre counts falling between those found with plaques and those in minimal asbestosis.\r"

The overall mortality rate was 8.7%, the serotype distribution in fatal cases reflecting the distribution of the whole group. The presence of mixed infection, predominantly with Haemophilus influenzae, was associated with a lower mortality rate of 3.5%. Nearly all patients (92%) were either elderly or had a chronic underlying disease and only one death occurred in a patient under 70 years who had no pre-existing disease. Of the pneumococcal serotypes isolated from the 292 patients with chronic chest disease, 82% are included in the new 23 valent pneumococcal vaccine and the efficacy of this needs to be assessed further in high risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "During 1982-4 20 cases of Mycobacterium malmoense infection were identified in Scotland (13 male, seven female; age 34-82, median 62 years). Features of the disease were obtained from case notes and radiographs of 19 patients and were found to be indistinguishable from those of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Chronic chest disease, predominantly chronic airflow obstruction, was the most frequent associated disease. The organisms showed in vitro resistance in eight patients to rifampicin, in 19 patients to isoniazid, and in all patients to pyrazinamide and p-aminosalicylic acid. Nevertheless, all patients showed an early response to standard combination chemotherapy with rifampicin, isoniazid, and ethambutol, with or without pyrazinamide. Five have been cured and none had died of the infection, although four died of unrelated disease. Of nine patients still having treatment, five had relapsed after completing a course of antituberculosis drugs. All had received ethambutol for less than five months. The response to standard drugs was more satisfactory when the course included administration of ethambutol for at least nine months. Currently one new infection with M malmoense occurs in Scotland for every 40 with tuberculosis, and the incidence appears to be rising. In view of this, it is suggested that when tuberculosis is suspected the chemotherapeutic regimen should include ethambutol until the culture results are reported. If these then show M malmoense, ethambutol should be continued in the combination for at least nine months.\r"

  ".W": "A study was designed to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of rebreathing and single breath soluble gas uptake measurements of effective pulmonary blood flow (Q) in patients with airways obstruction. Both rebreathing (RB) and single breath (SB) estimates of Q were compared with direct Fick and thermodilution (TD) measurements of cardiac output at rest and during exercise in eight patients with chronic, poorly reversible airflow obstruction with mean FEV1 65% predicted and mean FEV1/FVC 53%. The mean (SD) resting values obtained were QRB 3.47 (0.46), QSB 4.75 (1.15), QFick 4.77 (0.97), and QTD 5.15 (0.98). QRB was significantly lower than the other three estimates, which did not differ significantly from each other. Exercise produced significant increases in all four estimates for the group. The mean exercise values were QRB 6.23 (1.19), QSB 7.62 (1.97), QFick 8.97 (1.96), and QTD 9.09 (1.00), both QRB and QSB being significantly less than QFick and QTD. Analysis of variance of the rest, exercise, and combined data showed highly significant relationships with the TD and Fick measurements for both QRB and QSB over the range of values studied. In addition, the reproducibility of QRB and QSB was assessed in 15 other patients with chronic airflow obstruction (mean FEV1 42% predicted, FEV1/FVC 43%) and in 10 normal subjects. The coefficients of intrasubject variability for a single measurement for QRB were 8.7% in normal subjects and 10.2% in patients and for QSB were 11.7% in normal subjects and 16.1% in patients. The group differences from morning to afternoon, between days, and over a month were not significant in the normal subjects. In the patients QRB was slightly higher in the afternoon than in the morning of the same day, but the differences between days and over a month were not significant for either test. Although both tests detected the increase in pulmonary blood flow during exercise, the single breath test was more accurate at rest. Some underestimation was present for rebreathing at rest and for both tests during exercise, but this can be allowed for. In patients with mild airflow obstruction the reproducibility of the soluble gas uptake methods was similar to that of invasive catheter methods of cardiac output estimation. The single breath test in particular was, however, less reproducible in patients with more severe airflow obstruction, and the rebreathing method may be more useful for detecting increases in pulmonary blood flow in these patients.\r"

The majority of patients who had unnoticed gross extension of the tumor beyond the prostate underwent transurethral resection of the prostate or failed irradiation therapy prior to radical prostatectomy.

In the undescended testes from the cryptorchid patients, during prepubertal and pubertal periods, elastic fibers could not be visualized in the tunica propria, but were found after puberty. The positive Weigert reaction of the tunica propria in the undescended testes from postpubertal cryptorchid patients, however, was markedly weaker than that in normal control patients, suggesting diminution of elastic fibers. This diminution of elastic fibers in the undescended testes from postpubertal cryptorchid patients was also substantiated by electron microscopy. However, in the contralateral scrotal testes, elastic fibers appeared during puberty and were observed after puberty in the same manner as in normal testes.

In this investigation we assessed the relationship between these global indexes and directly measured indexes of regional function during 15 minutes of coronary occlusion followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion in 22 open-chest dogs. A computerized nuclear cardiac probe was used to assess EF and PDFR. Indexes of regional function were measured by Doppler ultrasonic wall-thickening probes. During coronary occlusion, paradoxical systolic thinning occurred and the EF and PDFR decreased an average of 31.6% and 24.4%, respectively. During reperfusion the EF and PDFR improved rapidly and at 60 minutes were similar to baseline. Systolic wall thickening improved more gradually and remained abnormal throughout reperfusion. Likewise, indexes of diastolic function (mean rate to half end-diastolic thinning and late diastolic thinning fraction) recovered slowly and remained abnormal throughout reperfusion (78% and 69.7%, respectively). The correlation between the rate of change of global and regional function was poor during both coronary occlusion and reperfusion. Thus, during coronary occlusion the global and regional indexes of ventricular function undergo directionally similar changes. However, during coronary reperfusion the global indexes do not reflect the slow recovery of the stunned myocardium.\r"

  ".W": "Persistence of regional contractile dysfunction after restoration of blood flow to transiently ischemic myocardium has been well described. To date, most studies have been performed in anesthetized animals. The present investigation compared the time course of recovery of regional segment shortening (percentage of segment shortening) in anesthetized versus conscious dogs subjected to a brief period of total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Periods of occlusion lasting 5, 10, and 15 minutes were followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. Dogs anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (30 mg/kg intravenously) had a significantly higher heart rate and blood pressure and lower dP/dt than conscious dogs. Coronary artery occlusion resulted in similar degrees of regional dyskinesis or akinesis, indicative of severe myocardial ischemia, in all experiments. During reperfusion, a gradual return of contractile function toward baseline was observed. At the end of the first 15 minutes of reflow, dogs subjected to 5 minutes of coronary occlusion demonstrated approximately 70% of control segment shortening in the previously ischemic zone. Animals subjected to 10- and 15-minute periods of coronary artery occlusion showed approximately 60% and 40% of control segment shortening at the same time point, respectively. The remainder of the 3-hour reperfusion period was characterized by a more gradual recovery of regional segment function. No differences were observed between anesthetized and conscious animals. It is concluded that the time course of functional recovery of postischemic reperfused myocardium is directly related to the duration of coronary occlusion and is similar in conscious and anesthetized dogs.\r"
