The incidence rates of lactation at delivery were 73% for the control group and 58% for the low-birth-weight group; 11% of the infants of low birth weight fed breast milk were never put to the breast. The mean age at first suckling was 277.3 hours in the low-birth-weight group, compared with 3.3 hours in the control group (p less than 0.0005). At first suckling 81% of the low-birth-weight infants and 25% of the control infants sucked poorly or refused the breast (p less than 0.001). At discharge 65% of the breast-milk-fed control infants were exclusively breast-fed, compared with 3% of the low-birth-weight infants fed breast milk (p less than 0.001). The incidence rates of lactation over time were similar in the control and low-birth-weight groups (51% v. 44% at 1 month, 29% v. 13% at 3 months, 13% v. 4% at 6 months and 4% v. 2% at 12 months). The mean duration of lactation was 3.2 months for the control group and 2.5 months for the low-birth-weight group. In the long term 37% of the low-birth-weight infants fed breast milk failed to breast-feed, compared with 2% of the control infants, and only 31% were exclusively breast-fed, compared with 85% of the control infants (p less than 0.001). However, the degree of satisfaction with the lactation experience was similar in the two groups. We conclude that mothers of low-birth-weight infants have good potential for lactation.\r"

The rates fluctuated over the study period, but linear trend analysis showed no increase or decrease for cleft lip with or without cleft palate; however, there was a significant increase for isolated cleft palate, attributed to improved ascertainment around 1963-66. Given the possible effects of newer agents used in both silviculture and agriculture, as well as the general concern over drugs and other environmental agents, such a long-term monitoring program is important. Furthermore, if significant clustering occurs, good background data are essential for comparison. The general public's perception is that the rates of birth defects are increasing. Our findings should give some reassurance with respect to orofacial clefts.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of physical exercise conditioning on fasting and postprandial lipoprotein levels was studied in six normolipidemic subjects. The study consisted of two phases: a baseline stabilization phase in which subjects maintained their regular physical activity and an exercise conditioning phase in which subjects had 29 exercise sessions during a 7-week period. Each of these sessions consisted of jogging on a treadmill for 30 minutes. The subjects averaged 15.2 miles/wk. To control for possible confounding factors, such as changes in diet composition and weight loss, we placed the subjects on a metabolic diet and increased their daily caloric intake during the exercise phase. At the end of each phase of the study, a vitamin A-fat loading test was done to specifically label and follow postprandial lipoprotein levels, and a maximum oxygen consumption test was done to evaluate the subjects' physical fitness. The exercise conditioning phase significantly increased the subjects' aerobic capacity and postheparin lipoprotein lipase activity, and the phase decreased fasting triglyceride levels. Physical exercise also significantly decreased chylomicron (Sf greater than 1,000) levels by 37%. In summary, this study suggests that physical exercise conditioning reduces fasting and postprandial lipoprotein levels by increasing the catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles. Because these particles may have a role in atherogenesis, this could be a major mechanism by which exercise prevents coronary heart disease.\r"

Treadmill exercise tests were done according to a randomized double-blind protocol 90 minutes after administration of placebo, 80 mg propranolol, or 120 mg diltiazem, each at both -8 degrees and 20 degrees C. Eight of the patients were classified by history as cold-sensitive before the study. For the entire group, none of the exercise end points differed significantly between cold and normal temperatures with placebo. However, cold-sensitive patients developed 1 mm ST depression 30% sooner (169 +/- 41 versus 244 +/- 38 seconds, p less than 0.01) at -8 degrees C compared with 20 degrees C. At the onset of ischemia, rate-pressure product was lower in the cold (19.8 +/- 1.0 versus 22.0 +/- 1.6 x 10(-3), p less than 0.05). Both propranolol and diltiazem prolonged time to onset of 1 mm ST depression at both temperatures. The magnitude of improvement at -8 degrees C was equal to that at 20 degrees C, and differences between the two drugs were not statistically significant. Only diltiazem prolonged total exercise duration. Thus, as assessed by exercise testing, cold does not worsen ischemic threshold in most stable angina patients. However, in a subgroup identifiable by history, ischemic threshold is lower in the cold. Propranolol and diltiazem are as effective for exercise-induced ischemia in a cold environment as at normal temperatures.\r"

To investigate the extent of this sympathetic activation, we studied the effect of maximal exercise on nonexercising vascular beds in 35 patients with left ventricular failure (ejection fraction, 21 +/- 8%; peak exercise oxygen uptake (VO2), 12.3 +/- 3.5 ml/min/kg). In 28 patients, cardiac output and leg blood flow were measured during maximal upright bicycle exercise. Total flow to nonexercising tissue was then calculated as cardiac output--(2 x leg flow). In seven patients and six normal subjects, forearm blood flow was measured during supine bicycle exercise before and after alpha-adrenergic blockade with intravenous phentolamine. Maximal upright exercise increased the vascular resistance of nonexercising tissue from 34 +/- 16 units at upright rest to 45 +/- 25 units (p less than 0.02) but did not affect total flow to nonexercising tissue (rest, 2.9 +/- 1.0; maximal exercise, 2.8 +/- 1.4 l/min; p = NS). Supine exercise had no significant effect on forearm blood flow or vascular resistance in the normal subjects. In the patients with heart failure, supine exercise increased forearm vascular resistance from 45 +/- 17 to 58 +/- 25 mm Hg/ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.02), again with no change in tissue flow (rest, 2.4 +/- 0.1; maximal exercise, 2.4 +/- 0.9 ml/min/100 ml; p = NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of this technique on patients with pulmonary hypertension, however, has not been fully evaluated. Accordingly, serial assessment of pulmonary vascular resistance was made in 14 patients with critical mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 250 dynes.sec/cm5 or mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 40 mm Hg or both) who underwent percutaneous balloon dilatation of the mitral valve. Balloon valvuloplasty was performed with either one (n = 10) or two (n = 4) balloons through the transseptal approach, and it resulted in significant improvement in mean mitral gradient (from 18 +/- 4 to 9 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), systemic blood flow (from 3.7 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 2.2 l/min, p less than 0.001), and calculated mitral valve area (from 0.7 +/- 0.2 to 1.6 +/- 0.7 cm2, p less than 0.001). Immediately after balloon mitral valvuloplasty, pulmonary vascular resistance fell from 630 +/- 570 to 447 +/- 324 dynes.sec/cm5. Repeat catheterization 7 +/- 4 months after valvuloplasty showed further improvement of pulmonary hypertension in 12 of the 14 patients, with a mean pulmonary vascular resistance for the group as a whole of 280 +/- 183 dynes.sec/cm5, p less than 0.005. In two patients, mitral valve restenosis to a mitral valve area less than 1.0 cm2 was associated with a return of pulmonary hypertension to predilatation values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Propafenone is an antiarrhythmic drug that produces a variable degree of beta-blockade in humans and is administered as a racemate. To examine the relative contribution of the individual enantiomers to pharmacologic effects seen during treatment with propafenone, we assessed the steady-state plasma concentrations of (+)-S-propafenone and (-)-R-propafenone in seven patients who were on long-term oral therapy, and we evaluated the electrophysiologic and beta-blocking properties of both enantiomers in vitro. The metabolism of propafenone is known to be polymorphic and to cosegregate with that of debrisoquine-4-hydroxylation. Among five patients with the extensive metabolizer phenotype (EM), the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of (+)-S-propafenone to (-)-R-propafenone was 1.73 +/- 0.15 (mean +/- SD). In the other two patients, who had the poor metabolizer phenotype (PM), the concentrations of both enantiomers were elevated but the S/R ratios were similar to those seen in patients with EM. In canine cardiac Purkinje fibers, both enantiomers produced similar frequency-dependent depression of maximum upstroke of phase 0. In contrast, the affinity of the human lymphocyte beta 2-adrenoceptor was approximately 100-fold greater for (+)-S-propafenone (Ki, 7.2 +/- 2.9 nM) than for the (-)-R-enantiomer (Ki, 571 +/- 141 nM). We conclude that during long-term oral therapy, propafenone undergoes stereoselective disposition in patients with either EM or PM. beta-Blockade during propafenone therapy is likely related to accumulation of (+)-S-propafenone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sources of within-group variability were evaluated by subgrouping maps by patient sex, age, height, and weight. Contribution of reproducibility error to total variance was assessed in a separate group of 52 normal subjects in whom multiple maps were recorded. Total variance was significantly lower in women than in men. Total variance tended to decrease with age, and the greatest decrease occurred in men during the 3rd decade. The ratio of total variance to mean signal energy showed a slow decrease with age for each group. Results suggest that the dominant source of within-group variability arises from variability of cardiac electric sources while the influence of volume conductor variability is significantly less. Variability due to measurement reproducibility was approximately half of the total variance.\r"

  ".W": "Recent experience with the spring-loaded patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) occluder has demonstrated several advantages of this device in the closure of intracardiac defects compared with previously described techniques. Pathologic and animal model studies were performed to identify which atrial septal defects (ASDs) might be suitable for device closure and to test a new septal closure double umbrella. Fifty specimens from the Cardiac Registry with unrepaired ASD secunda (2 degrees) were analyzed. Mean ASD size was 8 x 10 mm (range, 3 x 4 to 30 x 30 mm); 80% (n = 40) of ASDs were judged closable with the new device. ASD closure was attempted in four lambs with the Rashkind (hooked single umbrella) ASD occluder. One of four umbrellas was correctly positioned; no ASDs were closed. A new double-hinged (\"clamshell\") umbrella device was designed: eight ASD closures were attempted with this device (defects ranged from 8 to 20 mm in diameter). Six of eight umbrellas were correctly positioned; four of four animals observed more than 1 day appeared to have complete closure on postmortem examination with endothelialization of the device. We conclude that 1) most ASD 2 degrees are far enough from vital structures to permit closure, 2) initial placement of hooked umbrellas is often incorrect and cannot be altered, 3) clamshell double umbrellas were successfully placed in six of eight attempts, and 4) endothelialization of closed ASDs appears complete within weeks of implantation. These preliminary studies appear promising and support testing the clamshell ASD device in clinical trials.\r"

  ".W": "Action potential transmission in the canine ventricle normally occurs from the Purkinje (P) system into the ventricular muscle (VM) at specific P-VM junction sites. Transitional (T) cells are located between the Purkinje and the ventricular (V) cells at these P-VM junction sites. It has been shown that exposure to elevated [K+]0 in combination with hypoxia produces an increase in the P-VM conduction time. To examine this increase in P-VM conduction time, simultaneous measurements of the action potential upstrokes of T cells and the activation times of the local P and V cells at P-VM junctional sites were obtained from in vitro canine papillary muscles. The effects of elevated [K+]0 and hypoxia on conduction from P cells to T cells was then compared with the conduction from T cells to V cells to assess the relative contribution of each to the increase in the P-VM conduction time. We found that this intervention has approximately equal effects on the two sequential steps involved in P-VM conduction. We then analyzed the increased delay from T cells and V cells on the basis of three hypothetical mechanisms: 1) increased coupling resistance, 2) decreased V cell excitability, and 3) decreased cellular responsiveness of the T cells. Our results show that the effects of elevated [K+]0 and hypoxia on T-VM delay can be accounted for by a decreased responsiveness of the T cells without any significant electrical uncoupling between T and V cells or decrease in VM excitability.\r"

  ".U": "89230712\r", 
  ".W": "Antiarrhythmic drugs have been reported to produce variable effects on defibrillation energy requirements. However, the relation between the in vitro electrophysiologic effects of these agents and the changes in defibrillation energy requirements have not been systematically examined. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of the sodium channel blocking drugs lidocaine and procainamide, the action potential prolonging drugs N-acetyl procainamide and clofilium, and the potassium current blocker cesium in acute canine models with the same internal spring and epicardial patch electrodes used in humans for ventricular defibrillation testing. Ten series of experiments were performed in 78 dogs. Nonlinear regression was used to derive curves of energy dose versus percent successful defibrillation attempts and the 50% and 90% effective energy dose for each experimental condition. Saline control experiments indicated that the preparation was stable throughout the 6-hour duration of the experiments. Lidocaine doubled the defibrillation energy requirement (p less than 0.001) at a mean plasma concentration of 8.2 micrograms/ml. The effect of lidocaine on defibrillation energy was reversible, present at therapeutic plasma concentrations, linearly related to plasma concentration (r = 0.69, p less than 0.002), and present even after only 5-second episodes of ventricular fibrillation. In contrast, procainamide had no effect on defibrillation energy at mean plasma concentrations of 8.5 and 13 micrograms/ml, even after prolonged (30-second) episodes of ventricular fibrillation, whereas N-acetyl procainamide, clofilium, and cesium all decreased the energy requirement for defibrillation by 13-27%. Moreover, with the addition of N-acetyl procainamide, there was a trend toward diminishing the increase in defibrillation energy requirement caused by lidocaine. All agents prolonged the mean ventricular fibrillation cycle length. Lidocaine shortened the QT interval, whereas all other agents increased the QT (p less than 0.05). The major electrophysiologic effect of lidocaine is of sodium channel blockade, whereas, N-acetyl procainamide, clofilium, and cesium predominantly increase the action potential duration, and procainamide exerts both effects. Thus, these data indicate that sodium channel block and action potential prolongation exert significant and antagonistic modulating effects on defibrillation energy requirements.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes the clinical, laboratory, and electrophysiologic features of 52 patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) who had no clinical evidence of heart disease. The mean age of patients was 36 years, cardiovascular collapse occurred in 18 patients (35%), and exercise-related symptoms were present in 24 of 49 patients (49%). There were 20 patients with sustained monomorphic VT, 11 with incessant VT, and 21 with nonsustained VT. Abnormalities were present in 14 of 38 patients (37%) during echocardiography and in 21 of 47 patients (45%) who underwent cardiac catheterization. During baseline evaluation while patients were not receiving antiarrhythmic drugs, ambulatory monitoring and exercise testing showed an 88% and 57% incidence, respectively, of nonsustained or sustained monomorphic VT, whereas 31 of 50 patients (62%) had inducible VT (requiring an infusion of isoproterenol in 11 patients) during programmed electrical stimulation. The clinical VT (when a 12-lead electrocardiogram was available for analysis) had a left bundle branch block (LBBB) configuration in 20 of 33 patients (61%) and a right axis deviation in 17 of 33 patients (51%). The VT occurring during exercise testing and programmed electrical stimulation had the same configuration as the clinical VT in 22 of 22 patients. Three patients have received an antitachycardia pacemaker, and one patient underwent endocardial resection. Forty-eight patients (92%) were treated medically. One patient died of cancer; the remaining 47 patients were alive at a mean follow-up of 96 months after initial symptoms and 46 months after programmed electrical stimulation. We conclude that in patients without clinical evidence of heart disease, VT may be incessant, sustained, or nonsustained and that VT originates from the right ventricular outflow tract in more than 50% of patients. Although cardiac abnormalities may be found in more than 30% of patients, the exact significance of these abnormalities is unclear because of the absence of progressive changes and the excellent prognosis of this group of patients.\r"

Al in dialysate solutions was always less than 25 micrograms/l. Baseline Al levels greater than 100 micrograms/l were found in 22% of patients in 1981 but in none in 1987, while the percentage of values less than 60 micrograms/l increased from 55 to 91%. DFO tests were positive in 54% and 7% of cases in 1981 and 1987, respectively. A clinical diagnosis of Al intoxication was performed in 6 patients in 1981, and no further cases were diagnosed later. DFO treatment (50 mg/kg once a week) was employed preventively in 31 patients owing to positive DFO-tests, and in the 6 Al-intoxicated patients therapeutically. In the former patients none developed clinical intoxication. In the latter group clinical improvement was only temporary in the three parathyroidectomized patients. Al hydroxide [Al(OH)3] as a phosphate binder was tapered off in 1981 and substituted by Al-free chelants. In 1987, 66% of patients were given CaCO3 or Mg (OH)2 alone or in association, while 34% still needed Al(OH)3, although at low dosages (less than 2 g/day). The conclusion is that such a protocol is able to prevent and to treat cases of Al intoxication, albeit only partially.\r"

The long-term course of the disease was investigated in 46 consecutive and unselected patients over a period of 15 years (1970-1986) with a mean observation time of five years (+/- 45 months). Most of the 46 patients had idiopathic RPGN (61%). Initially, hemodialysis needed 25 of the 46 patients (54%). Immunosuppressive therapy (plasma exchange, methylprednisolone pulses, steroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine) was administered in 36 of the 46 patients (78%). A remission was achieved in only 19 of the 36 patients who received immunosuppression (53%) and no spontaneous improvement was seen. Factors indicating poor prognosis were initial high serum creatinine, high percentage of crescents in glomeruli, glomerular sclerosis, and immunohistologic staining of the IgG at the tubuli. In 11 patients with remission, immunosuppression was discontinued and 6 had a relapse. Long-term immunosuppression was given to 8 patients with remission. Their renal function was not normal (creatinine 240 +/- 77 mumol/l), but none had a relapse (p = 0.01). It is concluded that the treatment of RPGN requires long-term attendance and repeated immunosuppression comparable to a systemic immune disease.\r"

  ".W": "Oxygen transport by erythrocytes was studied in eight patients on maintenance hemodialysis before, during and after a 2-week stay at an altitude of 2000 m. Dialysis was continued at that altitude. In all tests, blood samples were collected one or two days following hemodialysis. Pre-altitude tests: The patients exhibited anemia (hemoglobin concentration, Hb = 97.4 +/- 17 g/l). Due to an elevated red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate concentration (2,3-DPG) and mild metabolic acidosis, elevated standard and in vivo P50 values (pO2 at 50% oxygen saturation of hemoglobin, sO2) were measured. Altitude: Upon ascent, arterial pO2 decreased from 82 +/- 4 torr to about 60 torr, sO2 was lowered by 5%. After 2 weeks sojourn, pO2 and sO2 increased towards normal values. In contrast to healthy subjects, dialysis patients developed respiratory alkalosis (blood pH: +0.074) upon ascent. This caused a significant shift to the left of the oxygen dissociation curve (ODC), indicated by lowered in vivo P50-values (P50,vv,-2 torr). Red cell 2,3-DPG, P50,st (P50 at a blood pH = 7.4 and pCO2 = 40 torr), hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit showed a high day-to-day variability and did not change because of the altitude exposure. We interpret the increase of the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin in patients with renal anemia as beneficial, as it favors oxygen loading of hemoglobin in the lung during exposure to a hypoxic environment.\r"

Using an anti-complementary assay there was a significant correlation between the ability of parent sera to fix complement and the absolute levels of PEG precipitable IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3. These data suggest that the ability of immune complexes in the sera of patients with SLE to fix complement is dependent on their IgG subclass composition.\r"

A 5 micron pore filtration method, which is highly sensitive to polymerization of haemoglobin S, was used to demonstrate a significant improvement in the deformability of deoxygenated sickle erythrocytes at concentrations (0.75-1.5 mmol/l] of BW12C and BWA589C that are achievable in vivo. Both compounds may therefore be of value for the treatment of sickle cell disease. 4. Filtration of sickle cells through pores of 5 microns diameter is a sensitive technique for evaluating the rheological effects of potential anti-sickling compounds.\r"

Platelet aggregability, as measured by filtragometry, was similarly increased during both adrenaline infusion (P less than 0.05) and CWT (P less than 0.01). 6. The coefficients of variation for beta-TG and PF4 levels were 17.3% for log beta-TG and 27.9% for log PF4 between days, but could not be calculated for within-day variability. Both beta-TG (P less than 0.05) and PF4 (P less than 0.01) levels decreased time-dependently during placebo infusion, indicating that long resting periods (hours) are needed to attain basal levels. Artefactual results could not be identified by evaluating beta TG/PF4 ratios. 7. beta-TG and PF4 levels did not decrease time-dependently during adrenaline infusion. There were no significant changes of beta-TG or PF4 during CWT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "1. Oxidative drug metabolizing capacity has been assessed by oral antipyrine and/or theophylline tests in consecutive patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP; alcoholic 24, idiopathic 47), acute pancreatitis (AP; 28) and pancreatic cancer (CA; 11). Most of the patients had drastically reduced their alcohol consumption and dietary fat intake for variable periods before the tests. Excellent bioavailability of theophylline was confirmed from paired oral and intravenous tests in seven subjects, including two with exocrine pancreatic failure. 2. The clearance of theophylline in the patients was faster than in 15 controls with a 'healthy lifestyle' [median 104 (range 18-320) ml h-1 kg-1 vs median 68 (range 50-97) ml h-1 kg-1, P less than 0.01]. The difference was especially apparent in the groups with alcoholic CP (P less than 0.001 and idiopathic CP (P less than 0.01), but not in the AP and CA group as a whole, although drug clearance in some 50% of those cases exceeded the reference range. 3. There was good correlation between theophylline and antipyrine clearance in a subset of 91 subjects who had both tests (15 controls, 76 patients), but antipyrine was much less sensitive as a marker of enzyme induction. This suggests that enzyme induction in pancreatic disease preferentially involves the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-inducible subfamily of cytochrome P-450. 4. The lack of correlation between pancreatic secretory capacity in 56 cases, judged by a secretin-pancreozymin test, and theophylline clearance suggests that enzyme induction is not secondary to pancreatic dysfunction. 5. Multivariate regression analysis identified approximately 50% of variability in clearance of each probe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three models have been proposed: (1) a single carrier, (2) a single carrier plus passive diffusion, and (3) a two-carrier system. The objectives of the current studies were to define the transport model that best fits experimental data and to devise methods to obtain the kinetic constants, corrected for diffusion barrier resistance, with this model. 2. Intestinal glucose uptake was measured during perfusion of rat jejunum in vivo over a wide range of perfusate concentrations and diffusion barrier resistance was determined under identical experimental conditions. The data were fitted to the transport equations that describe the three models with appropriate diffusion barrier corrections, and the kinetic constants were derived by non-linear regression techniques. The fit of each model to the data was assessed using six statistical tests, five of which favoured a model described by a single carrier and passive diffusion. 3. The main conclusions of these studies are: (1) kinetic constants uncorrected for diffusion barrier resistance are seriously in error; (2) values for the derived kinetic constants are strongly dependent on the transport model selected for the data analysis which underscores the need for rigorous model analysis; (3) corrected kinetic constants may be obtained by either non-linear regression or by a simpler graphical analysis once the correct transport model has been selected and diffusion barrier resistance determined; (4) only corrected kinetic constants should be used for inter-species comparisons or to study the effect of specific interventions on intestinal glucose transport.\r"

These effects were prevented by ganglionic blockade with pentolinium. 2. The cardiovascular responses to morphine were not altered by pretreatment with a vasopressin V1-receptor antagonist. 3. After bilateral adrenalectomy morphine caused a similar rise in noradrenaline but no increase in adrenaline. The rise in blood pressure was attenuated and the hyperglycaemia was abolished. 4. Adrenaline infused intravenously to mimic the levels that occurred after morphine caused a similar degree of hyperglycaemia but only a small increase in blood pressure. 5. Pretreatment with intracerebroventricular naloxone prevented the morphine-induced hypertension, hyperglycaemia, increase in plasma catecholamines, respiratory depression and sedation. 6. These results demonstrate that, in conscious rabbits, intravenous morphine causes hypertension by increasing sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve activity and elevating plasma adrenaline levels; the latter alone produces the hyperglycaemia. Vasopressin release is not involved in the hypertensive response to morphine. The effects of morphine appear to result from stimulation of central opiate receptors leading to enhanced sympathoadrenal outflow.\r"

  ".W": "1. Anterior tibial muscle protein synthesis in seven healthy postabsorptive men was determined from increases in muscle protein bound leucine enrichment during a primed continuous infusion of L-[1-13C]leucine. Biopsies were taken 30 min after the beginning of leucine infusion (when plasma 13C enrichment was steady), 240 min later during continued fasting and again after 240 min of infusion of a mixed amino acid solution which increased plasma total amino acid concentrations by 37%. The mean enrichment of 13C in plasma alpha-ketoisocaproate was used as an index of the enrichment of the precursor pool for leucine metabolism. 2. Anterior tibial muscle mixed protein synthetic rate during fasting was 0.055 (SD 0.008)%/h and this increased by an average of 35% during infusion of mixed amino acid to 0.074 (SD 0.021)%/h (P less than 0.05). 3. Whole-body protein breakdown (expressed as the rate of endogenous leucine appearance in plasma) was 121 (SD 8) mumol h-1 kg-1 during fasting and decreased (P less than 0.01) by an average of 12% during amino acid infusion. Leucine oxidation was 18 (SD 3) mumol h-1 kg-1 during fasting and increased (P less than 0.001) by 89% during amino acid infusion. Whole-body protein synthesis (non-oxidative leucine disappearance) was 104 (SD 6) mumol h-1 kg-1 during fasting and rose by 13% (P less than 0.001) during mixed amino acid infusion. 4. 13C enrichment of muscle free leucine was only 61 (SD 19)% of that in plasma alpha-ketoisocaproate and this increased to 74 (SD 16)% (P less than 0.02) during mixed amino acid infusion. 5. The results suggest that increased availability of amino acids reverses whole-body protein balance from negative to positive and a major component of this is the increase in muscle protein synthesis.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review of patients who underwent double bowel resections and synchronous anastomoses without ileostomy or colostomy was undertaken. The study goal was to determine whether there was an increased incidence of complications attributable to the presence of a second anastomosis. A total of 66 patients who met the criteria were identified and divided into two groups. Group A consisted of 30 patients who had had two colonic resections and two colonic anastomoses. In Group B were 36 patients who had undergone separate colonic and small-bowel resections with two subsequent anastomoses. The indications for primary resection were: 1) adenocarcinoma, 54 percent; 2) Crohn's disease, 26 percent; 3) diverticulitis, 11 percent; 4) \"other\" indications, 9 percent. The indications for the second resection were: 1) metastatic adenocarcinoma, 30 percent; 2) Crohn's disease, 26 percent; 3) synchronous bowel lesions, 18 percent; 4) adhesions and enterotomies, 14 percent; 5) \"other\" indications, 12 percent. Overall, there were four major complications (6 percent), and 11 minor complications (17 percent). The sole anastomotic leak occurred in a patient who had undergone a double colonic resection (3%). The other major complications were one death, one ureteral complication that required reoperation, and one early small-bowel obstruction. Minor complications included two wound infections (3 percent), three seromas (5 percent), three prolonged ileus (5 percent), and three urinary infections (5 percent). These results are comparable to the best results reported for patients undergoing single colonic anastomoses. The conclusion is that it is safe to perform synchronous anastomoses without diversion provided the following conditions are present: well-prepared bowel with minimal fecal soilage, an adequate blood supply, technically good anastomoses, and lack of tension on the suture lines.\r"

Two thirds of the patients underwent a single rubber band ligation and one third a double rubber band ligation in one session without anesthesia. Ninety-four required repeated ligations. A follow-up of 25 +/- 16 months (mean +/- SD) was carried out in 153 of them. Rubber band ligation was followed by prolonged bleeding in six patients and severe pain requiring removal of the rubber band in 12 patients. The complication rate decreased significantly (P less than .05) in the last 80 patients. Compared with multiple ligation, single rubber band ligation in one sitting was followed by a lower complication rate (P less than .01). Long-term results were good in 71 percent of the patients. (A formal hemorrhoidectomy was needed within two years in 6 percent.) A significantly lower recurrence rate of 9 percent was noted in those with normal bowel habits, when compared with constipated subjects whose symptoms recurred in 85 percent (P less than .001). Constipation seems to be a predictable factor in worsening the outcome of rubber band ligation. Rubber band ligation is followed by a lower complication rate when performed in a single ligation.\r"

Subsequent proctocolectomy was required in seven patients though two patients with high vaginal fistulas were managed by total colectomy, end ileostomy, and oversewing of the rectal stump. Only two high fistulas resulting from ileal Crohn's disease resolved with resection and anastomosis of the diseased segment alone. Local repair was unsuccessful despite repeated operations in two of five patients. Two patients died of malignancy arising within a chronic vaginal fistula. Although some vaginal fistulas complicating Crohn's disease cause little disability and can be managed symptomatically, they do not heal by conservative therapy or by a proximal defunctioning stoma alone. In time, severe bowel symptoms develop in the majority of patients and necessitate proctectomy.\r"

Twenty of these patients subsequently had at least one successful pregnancy and delivery. Eleven deliveries were vaginal with episiotomy, and nine were cesarean sections. No maternal deaths occurred. One child died of hyaline membrane disease. The frequency of nocturnal stooling increased in the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis patients during pregnancy (P less than .01), and the increase persisted for three months after delivery (P less than .05). In contrast, the frequency of daytime stools, the incidence of incontinence, the consistency of the stool, and the development of perineal seepage or skin irritation were not greatly altered by pregnancy or delivery. Moreover, postpartum pouch function was not influenced by the type of delivery (vaginal vs. cesarean section). In conclusion, pregnancy and delivery are safe in patients with the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, but they lead to more frequent nocturnal stools. The type of delivery (vaginal vs. cesarean section) does not influence pouch functional outcome.\r"

The quantitative method appeared to be sensitive, easily reproducible, and standardizable. The tissue marker concentration was analyzed by means of the multivariate discriminant analysis, to evaluate the risk of relapse in each patient; the tumor CEA (CEA T) showed the best discriminant capacity (P = .005). The relative Fisher function provided a reliable prognostic patient index, independently of other recognized prognostic factors (Dukes' stage and cellular differentiation grade). The Cox model showed a statistical significance analyzing the tumor (T) and healthy mucosa (M) CEA values (P = .001 and P = .006, respectively). The combination of these two variables allowed for identification of three classes of patients according to CEA T and M threshold values of 216 and 85 ng/mg of protein, respectively, and different disease-free curves were obtained for each group. The two-year disease-free rate was 81 percent for patients with low values of both CEA T and M, and 21.4 percent for the group with both values above these thresholds (P = .0008). In the third class (CEA T or M higher than the reported cut-off levels), the two-year disease-free rate was 65.9 percent.\r"

The study group had a significant decrement of maximum basal pressure (MBP), 42.6 +/- 27.0 mm Hg, in PSS as compared with the control group, 71.2 +/- 24.9 mm Hg (P = .0004). The difference in the functional length (FL) of the anal canal, PSS:control = 2.4 +/- 1.0 cm:3.7 +/- 0.5 cm (P = .0001); the volume of first defecating sensation, PSS:control = 66.3 +/- 35.2 ml:125.1 +/- 43.8 ml; the voluntary component, the difference between maximum squeeze pressure (MSP) and MBP, PSS:control = 116.6 +/- 73.6 mm Hg:61.8 +/- 35.9 mm Hg (P = .0087), were also found to be statistically significant. Nevertheless, the MSP and maximal tolerable capacity (Vmax) showed no difference in these two groups (MSP, PSS:control = 159.3 +/- 88.1 mm Hg:132.9 +/- 44.9 mm Hg, P = .259), (Vmax, PSS:control = 193.1 +/- 67.7 ml:230.0 +/- 60.9 ml, P = .0526). Twelve (71 percent) of 17 patients did not have rectoanal inhibitory reflex, and paradoxical contraction during rectal balloon inflation was noted in ten patients. Nine patients had different degrees of anal incontinence and abnormal anometric profiles were found in six of eight asymptomatic patients. Therefore, only two patients (12 percent) had neither symptoms nor anometric evidence of anorectal involvement in PSS. Two patients with long-standing disease received posterior anal repair for stool incontinence, the postoperative results were satisfactory both subjectively and objectively. The average MBP increased from 0 to 20 mm Hg, average FL from 0 to 1.5 cm. Patients complained less frequently about stool incontinence or soiling, and their daily life is now more comfortable. The analysis indicates that anorectal function in PSS is affected much more frequently and earlier than thought. Anorectal manometry can be used as an adjuvant in diagnosing controversial cases. Once anal incontinence occurs, posterior anal repair can achieve good results after six months of follow-up.\r"

Simple diversion or resection with colostomy is performed followed by reestablishment of intestinal continuity at a subsequent operation. The use of a transendoscopic technique of balloon dilatation for complete malignant obstruction in the management of three patients is discussed. Successful balloon dilatation allowed for complete bowel preparation and either elective single-stage resection or controlled Nd:YAG laser palliation in a clean field. Although not applicable to all clinical situations, balloon dilatation is a valuable adjunct in the management of obstructing colorectal cancer. Relief of obstruction by tumor dilatation allows 1) correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, 2) administration of a complete bowel preparation, 3) single-stage resection and anastomosis, or 4) palliative laser photoablative therapy that avoids the need for colostomy.\r"

This study was designed based on the assumption that if two pH probes are placed equidistant from a distal acid source, and the probes measure different values, then one probe might miss acid if it were there alone. We performed 24-hr intraesophageal pH monitoring in 10 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease, simultaneously placing two pediatric pH probes (probes A and B) 5 cm proximal to the LES in such close proximity that one would expect only small differences in the acid exposure measured by the probes. However, the amount of acid exposure measured by probes A and B differed greatly in some instances. Individual probe performance does not alone account for these differences, since, when pH recordings were reviewed, one probe was as likely to miss acid exposure as the other. These differences would result in a change in the clinical diagnosis in two of 10 patients. Variability in the number of episodes was great and occurred even when there was concordance in percent acid exposure. These data raise questions about the absolute accuracy of the pH probe as the gold standard in the measurement of gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

Patients with achalasia had a normal acid secretory response (5.5 +/- 1.5 mmol/hr) to vagal stimulation when compared to controls (6.0 +/- 5.3 mmol/hr). However, the half time of gastric emptying of liquids was significantly shorter in patients with achalasia (10.4 +/- 1.8 min) than in control subjects (19.3 +/- 11.3 min) (P less than 0.01). Although there was a tendency towards a more rapid gastrointestinal transit in patients with achalasia, these changes failed to reach statistical significance. It is concluded that patients with achalasia have a gastric emptying disorder that could either be explained by a selective defect of extraesophageal vagal inhibitory nerve fibers or as an epiphenomenon occurring as a consequence of impaired esophageal emptying.\r"

In this study, we examined the psychological profile and effect of acute mental stress (dichotic listening task) on UES tone in seven patients reporting to the clinic with globus sensation and 13 healthy controls. Alterations in heart rate, blood pressure, frontalis EMG, and skin conductance confirmed the effectiveness of the stress test in patients and controls. During resting conditions, UES pressure (mean +/- SE) in patients (40.4 +/- 4.6 mm Hg) did not differ significantly from controls (46.5 +/- 4.7 mm Hg). In response to stress, UES pressure rose by 31% in patients (P = 0.04) and by 25% in controls (P = 0.002). The stress-induced rise in UES pressure in patients (9.5 +/- 3.8 mm Hg) was not significantly different to that observed in controls (11.8 +/- 3.0 mm Hg). Psychological profiles of globus patients presenting to the clinic revealed them to be more introverted, anxious, neurotic, and depressed than normal controls. We conclude that in patients with a history of globus sensation, resting UES pressure and its response to stress is normal. Although individuals presenting to the clinic with globus sensation showed increased levels of psychoneurosis, acute, predictable stress is not a factor in the genesis of globus sensation. UES hyperresponsiveness to other stimuli or subjective intolerance to changes in UES pressure could account for symptoms of globus sensation.\r"

  ".W": "To study whether or not the autonomic nervous system influences the defense mechanisms of the gastric mucosa, groups of Sprague-Dawley rats were given stimulants and inhibitors of the different components of the vagus and celiac nerves before administration of absolute or 70% w/v ethanol. The effects of vagotomy and sympathectomy on \"adaptive cytoprotection\" were studied, as were the effects of blocking the muscarinic receptors and stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors. We found that: (1) cholinomimetic agents and norepinephrine make the damage caused by 70% ethanol worse; (2) atropine is the only agent that fully protects against absolute ethanol; (3) vagotomy and sympathectomy abolish the effects of atropine and adaptive cytoprotection; and (4) beta-adrenergic stimulation replaces conditions that allow adaptive cytoprotection and the protection by anticholinergics. These results suggest that two different reflexes are triggered by ethanol: when low concentrations are given, the beta-adrenergic-mediated effect is prevalent, with protection of the mucosa; when high concentrations are given, the cholinergic-mediated effect is prevalent with damage of the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was undertaken in rats using 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) as a stimulator of gastric motility and a low dose of indomethacin as a prostaglandin (PG) synthesis inhibitor to investigate the roles of gastric motility and PG deficiency in the pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced gastric lesions. Subcutaneously administered indomethacin at 5 mg/kg did not induce any visible damage in the mucosa within 4 hr, but at 25 mg/kg produced linear hemorrhagic lesions along the long axis of the stomach. 2DG (100 mg/kg/hr), given intravenously, produced linear nonhemorrhagic lesions along the mucosal folds and, in the presence of 5 mg/kg of indomethacin, caused severe hemorrhagic lesions in the same areas of the stomach. Gastric motility was markedly enhanced by both indomethacin (25 mg/kg) and 2DG, while acid output and mucosal blood flow were increased only by the latter. Mucosal PGE2 levels were significantly reduced by indomethacin (25 mg/kg) but not by 2DG. Indomethacin at 5 mg/kg alone had no or little effect on any parameter except PG levels, which were reduced to similar degrees as caused by 25 mg/kg of the agent. Time-course development of the lesions was closely associated with those changes in gastric motility after administration of indomethacin (25 mg/kg) and 2DG. These results suggest that the enhanced gastric motility is, by itself, sufficient to induce damage (nonhemorrhagic) in the mucosa and that a PG deficiency alone does not induce any damage but is required for further extension to hemorrhagic lesions of nonhemorrhagic ones that are initially induced by enhanced gastric motility.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The concentration of GLP-1 in plasma increased from 64 +/- 12 to 189 +/- 23 and 631 +/- 76 pmol/liter, respectively. The concentration of truncated GLP increased from approximately 7 pmol/liter to 28 +/- 3 pmol/liter during the high rate of infusion. A similar increase was seen in response to a mixed meal in eight normal volunteers. The metabolic clearance rate (MCR) of GLP-1 was 2.2 +/- 0.3 and 2.6 +/- 0.3 ml/kg/min, respectively, and the half-life in plasma was 17 +/- 2 min. The MCR of truncated GLP-1 was 13 +/- 2.8 ml/kg/min and the half-life 11.4 +/- 2.1 min. GLP-1 reduced the pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion 16 +/- 9% during the low-rate infusion and 23 +/- 12% during the high rate (P less than 0.05). Truncated GLP-1 caused a 36 +/- 3% inhibition during the high infusion rate.

At day 4 crypt length and thymidine kinase activity were increased; no changes in villus parameters were recorded. No evidence of mast cell activation was found and leukotriene levels in the mucosa were normal. At day 7, the gut was acutely inflamed and edema was present at the tips of the villi. This progressed to enterocyte detachment, resulting in villus atrophy with decreased activities of brush border enzymes. At this stage mucosal histamine was decreased and rat mast cell protease II (RMCP II) was increased in serum, indicating mast cell activation. In addition, mucosal leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4, LTE4) were present in significant quantities. Following worm expulsion, the villus abnormalities resolved and serum RMCP II returned to normal. However, the crypt hyperplasia persisted. Our results suggest that during Nb infection at least two components of injury can be identified. One component, epithelial injury at the villus tips, may be related to activation of mucosal mast cells.\r"

The colonic mucosa was evaluated at colonoscopy, and mucosal biopsies obtained from the cecum, sigmoid colon, and rectum were evaluated by light microscopy, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. At colonoscopy mucosal ulcerations were absent in all the controls and all except one of the E. histolytica-infected patients. E. histolytica trophozoites or cysts were not seen in the lamina propria or on the luminal surface in any infected patient by light and immunofluorescence microscopy. On scanning electron microscopy, structures that resembled rounded E. histolytica trophozoites were seen on the luminal surface in two of 19 cecal specimens from the infected patients. Moderate or severe mucosal inflammation was frequent on light microscopy in both the E. histolytica-infected patients and the noninfected controls with the cecum involved in two thirds of both groups. Antibodies to E. histolytica were detected in serum of 25% of study patients and 58% of controls.

In patients with ulcerative colitis, colonic substance P concentration in inflamed mucosa (170 +/- 46 pg/mg) was significantly higher than its levels in normal subjects. Substance P may therefore have a role in the pathogenesis of clinical conditions associated with diarrhea and constipation.\r"

Four patients with radiation proctitis were treated with 4 g 5-ASA by enema nightly for two to six months. Patients were seen monthly, interviewed, and a sigmoidoscopic exam performed. No change was seen in the degree of mucosal inflammation on follow-up sigmoidoscopic exams. Three patients noted no change in their symptoms of bleeding, pain, or tenesmus. One patient noted initial improvement, but this was not sustained. 5-ASA enemas do not appear to be effective in the treatment of radiation proctitis.\r"

Twenty-four hours after its surgical preparation, the rat's jejunum was infused with a physiological micellar solution containing 200 nM alpha-tocopherol. Its transport rate into lymph and bile as well as its accumulation in liver and intestinal tissues was measured. Lymphatic transport of vitamin E increased from 92 to 269 pmol/5 hr and bile appearance of vitamin E and its polar metabolites increased from 230 to 298 pmol/5 hr as rats aged. Tissue accumulation of the vitamin in the small intestine and liver increased significantly with aging (P less than 0.05). Total absorption of the vitamin and its intestinal metabolites increased from 5912 pmol/5 hr in young rats to 16,467 pmol/5 hr in old rats (P less than 0.01). Absorption expressed as a percentage of infused alpha-tocopherol increased from 19.7% at 4 months to 54.9% at 24 months. These studies demonstrate an aging-associated increase in the total amount of vitamin E absorbed and a shift from portal to lymphatic transport. These changes may represent a salutary adaptive increase in the systemic availability of vitamin E with aging.\r"

Forty-four percent of the patients harbored at least one enteric pathogen: the most frequently recovered were Cryptosporidium (28), cytomegalovirus (16), Entamoeba histolytica (13), Giardia lamblia (9), and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (7). Patients harboring pathogens were more likely to be diarrheics (69%) than patients without a pathogen (38%; P = 0.01) and more likely to have endoscopic lesions (29%) than patients without a pathogen (4%; P less than 0.001). The most common pathogen associated with diarrhea was Cryptosporidium. Cytomegalovirus, Entamoeba histolytica, and Salmonella typhimurium were each significantly associated with endoscopic lesions. Patients with cytomegalovirus infection tended to have a greater incidence of ulcer than patients without cytomegalovirus infection. Stool analysis diagnosed 61% of the infections, while endoscopy diagnosed 44%. Seven percent were recognized by stool analysis and endoscopy. When considering the 24 patients in whom accurate diagnosis warranted endoscopic biopsies, stool examination alone would have given an incomplete diagnosis in 14 patients (due to the presence of polyinfection). The frequency of inaccurate diagnosis of infection by stool determination alone, plus the development of new antiviral agents that suppress cytomegalovirus, may favor the earlier application of endoscopic evaluation in these patients.\r"

We attempted to test this hypothesis in infants with suspected food protein-induced entercolitis by measuring serum ovalbumin (OVA) concentrations after ingestion of egg white (prior to the performance of good challenges to establish this diagnosis). We first noted significant underestimation of serum OVA concentrations in the presence of even low serum anti-OVA antibody concentrations (greater than 1:12). Next, using selected noninhibitory sera, we found that all infants studied absorbed some OVA, there was no correlation between serum OVA levels and age (3-11 months), and there was no significant difference between serum OVA concentrations in infants who subsequently had positive oral food challenge responses (120 +/- 67 ng/ml) and a matched group with negative challenges (102 +/- 80). These data do not support the hypothesis that \"intestinal closure\" (antigen exclusion) occurs in the neonatal period or the role of antigen absorption as the major etiological factor in the development of food sensitivity. Better methods of quantitating macromolecular absorption must be developed before the role of antigen absorption in food sensitivity can be assessed. Of note, urinary excretion of intact OVA also occurred. This varied greatly from one voiding to the next and continuing for at least 13 hr after ingestion.\r"

At four months postinitiation, the pancreata were quantitatively examined for the number and size of preneoplastic foci. In rats, coffee alone inhibited growth of acidophilic foci and, moreover, slightly inhibited the positive modulating effect of fat on growth of these foci, pointing to a negative rather than a positive interaction between these two life-style factors. In hamsters, coffee alone enhanced growth of cystic foci, whereas fat alone enhanced growth of ductular foci. An interaction between fat and coffee on pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamsters could not be demonstrated.\r"

A subsample of the research group of 25 children with diabetes (less than or equal to 11 yr old) was compared with an age-matched control group (n = 21) drawn from the original study of the PSI on total stress, parent- and child-domain, and subdomain scale scores. The two groups differed on one child-domain subscale, whereby children with diabetes are perceived by their mothers as more demanding than healthy controls. Three parent-subscale differences existed between the two groups, with mothers of children with diabetes reporting less attachment to their children, less spousal support, and poorer health. Analysis of the diabetes sample demonstrated significant stress on several of the child- and parent-domain subscales in a large proportion of the sample. Stress, at levels greater than or equal to 70th percentile of the control group, existed on the child scales of acceptability, mood, demanding behavior, and reinforcement for 51% of children with diabetes. Elevations associated with stress in the parenting role were evident on the scales associated with parental attachment, depression, and competence for 33% of parents. No differences in the level of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) existed between children whose mothers reported high levels of stress in themselves and their children and those whose mothers reported little stress. Hierarchal regression analysis demonstrated a significant relationship between the child stress scale of distractibility, the use of self-monitoring blood glucose assessment, and low levels of HbA1.\r"

Over 50,000 LEAs were performed on individuals with diabetes in the United States in 1985. Among individuals with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) are major predisposing factors for LEA. Lack of adequate foot care and infection are additional risk factors. Several large clinical centers have experienced a 44-85% reduction in the rate of amputations among individuals with diabetes after the implementation of improved foot-care programs. Programs to reduce amputations among people with diabetes in primary-care settings should identify those at high risk; clinically evaluate individuals to determine specific risk status; ensure appropriate preventive therapy, treatment for foot problems, and follow-up; provide patient education; and, when necessary, refer patients to specialists, including health-care professionals for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and shoe fitters for proper footwear. Programs should monitor and evaluate their activities and outcomes. Many issues related to the etiology and prevention of LEAs require further research.\r"

To assess its usefulness for testing autonomic integrity, cross correlation and deep breathing were compared in 141 diabetic subjects (aged 39 +/- 14 yr) and in 77 control subjects (aged 33 +/- 13 yr). To characterize patients, Valsalva maneuver, 30:15 ratio, tilt, and handgrip tests were performed in 96 of these patients; 23 had two or more abnormal tests (group A), 28 had one (group B), and 45 had none (group C). Sensitivity to parasympathetic withdrawal was compared in 9 control subjects (aged 26 +/- 4 yr) by four sequential 0.01-mg/kg i.v. atropine administrations. Reproducibility was compared in 11 control subjects (aged 25 +/- 2 yr) by repeating the tests four times for 2 consecutive days. Considering all 141 patients, cross correlation and deep breathing were less than 2SD of the mean of control subjects in 64 and 36 subjects, respectively. Considering patients who also performed other tests of autonomic function, cross correlation and deep breathing were less than 2SD of the mean of controls in 42 and 30 subjects, respectively (group A, 20 and 15; group B, 12 and 9; group C, 10 and 6). Cross correlation had better reproducibility than deep breathing (C.V. 10.3 vs. 30.6% at 6 breaths/min) and greater sensitivity to atropine (after the 1st injection, cross correlation and deep breathing decreased to 34.6 and 48.2% of baseline values, respectively; P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Hospital medical-record review was the primary source of case ascertainment. A large proportion of Black children in the county permitted race-specific analyses. The average annual IR among the Black children was less than half that observed in the White children (7.0/100,000 vs. 15.6/100,000, respectively). Nearly equal numbers of White boys and girls were diagnosed during this period; however, there were three times as many Black girls as Black boys diagnosed. Among the 134 Whites, age-specific annual IRs were highest in the 5- to 9- and 10- to 14-yr age groups. Little variation was observed in age-specific rates among the 41 Black subjects. A seasonal trend was evident in both races, with the fewest cases of IDDM diagnosed in the months of April through June (P less than .001). No association between the incidence of diabetes and income level was found among White or Black children. Significant differences in the epidemiology of IDDM between White and Black children suggest an important avenue for studying the etiology of IDDM.\r"

The bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus (B + E), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus (S + E), and S. aureus (SA). Intra-abscess pH measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. In the diabetic mice, the pH of an abscess induced with B + E, S + E, and SA was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the pH in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. Differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. The blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. No animals were ketotic. There were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. In conclusion, there is a significantly lower pH in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.\r"

This study investigated 17,586 referrals from 141 general practitioners to specialists in seven specialties in Ringkjobing county in Denmark. As an expression of the referral rate, a referral index was estimated for every general practitioner. The referral index was the number of referrals to the specialist per 1000 patients per year, including children, standardized for age and sex to the average population in Ringkjobing county. The following six variables were evaluated in relation to the referral index: specialists in the local area, doctors per practice, consultations per general practitioner per year, patients registered, consultations per 1000 patients per year standardized for age and sex, and supplementary procedures per consultation. Stepwise multiple regression analysis was used. The study showed that the referral index rose both with a better access to specialist and with an increasing number of consultations per practitioner per year. The referral index fell with increased numbers of patients registered. No correlation was found between the referral index and number of supplementary procedures per consultation, number of doctors per practice and number of consultations per 1000 patients per year.\r"

Virtually no association was found between social class and scores on the health measures, supporting earlier findings that unemployment leads to equally poor perceived health in middle class and working class males. High correlations were obtained between the 12-item general health questionnaire, the anxiety and the depression scales, with all three measures correlating quite highly with the emotional reactions, sleep and social isolation sections of the Nottingham health profile. However, the Nottingham health profile provided a broader assessment of perceived health, giving additional information on pain and physical mobility problems.\r"

The reduction was particularly marked with regard to erythromycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics, and in cases of rhinitis/rhinopharyngitis, pharyngitis and bronchitis. On an annual basis, the reduction was equivalent to 2.5 defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day. The study has shown that a reduction in antibiotic usage for respiratory tract infections can be achieved without changing the indications for antibiotic treatment.\r"

There were 319 accident cases seen by the general practitioners in the survey period, and 175 (55%) of these were farmers. Children accounted for 52 (16%) of all accident cases. The majority of cases (256, 80%) were treated by the general practitioner, and the spectrum of injuries treated was very broad. Many injuries required extensive suturing and follow-up of soft-tissue injuries. General practitioner coroners were involved with five fatal farm accident cases. It is concluded that the Irish rural general practitioner is providing a significant trauma service to farm accident victims, and is a valuable source of information on these incidents. The general practitioner would be a local source of expertise in a health education campaign directed at increasing the awareness among the farming community on the extent of farm accident morbidity and mortality. Continuing education for rural general practitioners should be directed towards regular updates on trauma management.\r"

This telephone counselling was studied during one week (Monday to Friday) at six Swedish health centres which were representative of rural as well as of urban populations. Based on the figures obtained from this study it could be calculated that about 20 million calls of this type are dealt with at Swedish health centres each year (population of Sweden about eight million). It was more common for women than for men to contact the health centre by telephone. About 70% of the calls were made by the patients themselves. Pain was the most common reason for contacting the health centre by telephone, followed by signs of infection. The majority of the telephone calls dealt with sick care, a minority were classified as administrative. About 40% of all calls were managed by the telephone adviser without involving the doctor at the health centre. Of all incoming calls, 44% resulted in an appointment time for a visit to a physician at the health centre, more than half of these being given for a visit during the same day. As the telephone counsel function is an important part of the activity at a Swedish health centre, it is important to evaluate its content and consequences.\r"

Acid output rose from a basal mean of 3.60 +/- 0.48 to a mean of 6.80 +/- 0.02 mmol H+/h with hypnosis, an increase of 89% (p = 0.0007). In a second study, subjects underwent two sessions of gastric analysis in random order, once with no hypnosis and once under a hypnotic instruction to experience deep relaxation and remove their thoughts from hunger. When compared to the no-hypnosis session, with hypnosis there was a 39% reduction in basal acid output (4.29 +/- 0.93 vs. 2.60 +/- 0.44 mmol H+/h, p less than 0.05) and an 11% reduction in pentagastrin-stimulated peak acid output (28.69 +/- 2.34 vs. 25.43 +/- 2.98 mmol H+/h, p less than 0.05). We have shown that different cognitive states induced by hypnosis can promote or inhibit gastric acid production, processes clearly controlled by the central nervous system. Hypnosis offers promise as a safe and simple method for studying the mechanisms of such central control.\r"

Determination of systolic time intervals showed that the preejection period and the ratio of the preejection period and the left ventricular ejection time were significantly reduced by administration of nifedipine plus placebo. Coadministration of famotidine and nifedipine, however, led to a significant increase of these parameters. In an additional double-blind study, a significant rise of the preejection period and of the ratio was detected after administration of famotidine alone. In impedance cardiography stroke volume and cardiac output were significantly reduced by famotidine. Heart rate and blood pressure values were not altered by the H2-antagonist. For the first time, to our knowledge, the observed changes of hemodynamic parameters appear to indicate that famotidine may exert negative effects on cardiac performance which, in our opinion, could be of clinical relevance in elderly subjects or in patients with heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-six patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome were studied prospectively to determine a safe and effective method and criterion for controlling gastric acid hypersecretion during periods when oral antisecretory agents could not be used. In each patient it was possible to reduce acid secretion to less than or equal to 10 mEq/h after an i.v. bolus of 150 or 300 mg of cimetidine and a stepwise titration of cimetidine given by continuous infusion. The mean dose given by i.v. infusion was 2.9 mg/kg body wt.h but there was a wide range (0.5-7.0 mg/kg body wt.h) and the minimal dose had to be determined individually for each patient. The minimal i.v. cimetidine dose did not correlate with basal or maximal acid output or fasting gastrin concentration, but correlated closely with either the previous oral dose of cimetidine (r = 0.96, p less than 0.001) or the previous oral dose of ranitidine or famotidine (r = 0.95, p less than 0.001). To study the efficacy and safety of an i.v. infusion of cimetidine, 34 patients undergoing surgery were maintained on i.v. cimetidine for a mean of 12 days (range 1-83 days). One-half of the patients did not require dose adjustment, whereas the remainder required an average of 2 adjustments, usually in the first 3 postoperative days. No patient developed complications attributable to gastric acid hypersecretion in the postoperative period, and there was no detectable neurologic, hematologic, or hepatic toxicity. This study demonstrates that a continuous i.v. infusion of cimetidine adequately inhibits gastric acid hypersecretion in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. However, high doses were frequently required, the dose had to be determined in a stepwise fashion individually for each patient, and the i.v. dose correlated with the previous oral dose. Reducing acid secretion to less than or equal to 10 mEq/h was a safe criterion during surgery and continuous i.v. cimetidine was safe and effective in achieving this degree of control for up to 83 days.\r"

Peptide action was dose-related, occurred within 30 min, and lasted for greater than 1 h. Bombesin-induced inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion was not altered by cervical cord transection. Intravenous infusion of the monoclonal bombesin antibody 2A11 abolished intravenous bombesin (10 micrograms/kg.h)-induced 33% inhibition of gastric response to pentagastrin but did not alter intrathecal bombesin (200 ng)-induced 38% inhibition of gastric response to pentagastrin. The inhibitory effect of bombesin (200 ng) on pentagastrin-stimulated gastric secretion was reversed by bilateral adrenalectomy or removal of celiac and mesenteric ganglia. Intrathecal injections of rat calcitonin gene-related peptide, neuromedin B, neuromedin U, and the stable substance P analogue (pGlu5, MePhe8, MeGly9)-substance P(5-11) did not alter pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion. These results demonstrate that bombesin injected into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord inhibits vagally stimulated and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric secretion in rats. Bombesin action is peptide specific, exerted at a spinal site, and expressed through the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

Exposure of the mucosa to each of the three agents induced intracellular acidification of surface epithelial cells, but the pattern of pHi behavior was different for each agent: taurocholate induced immediate acidification of pHi, ethanol acidified pHi after a delay of 4-6 min, whereas acetylsalicylic acid initially alkalinized pHi, whereafter a rapid acidification of pHi occurred. Assessment of intraepithelial membrane resistances indicated that taurocholate primarily increases cellular conductance, decreasing in particular Ra. In contrast, ethanol mainly increased paracellular conductance, but also decreased cellular resistance, in particular Ra. Acetylsalicylic acid initially increased cell membrane resistances and Ra/Rb, whereafter a rapid decrease of Ra/Rb and Rt occurred. In each instance, the decrease of Ra/Rb preceded acidification of pHi. The data suggest that all three agents induce intracellular acidification by increasing the conductance of the apical cell membrane to H+, but in ethanol-treated tissues paracellular conductance primarily contributes to H+ back-diffusion.\r"

Among 5933 Japanese men studied in Hawaii, 243 developed gastric ulcers and 99 developed duodenal ulcers 20 yr after an examination completed in 1968. The examination included measurement of forced expiratory volume in 1 s and a detailed smoking history. The percent predicted forced expiratory volume was significantly and inversely related to ulcer incidence, but not after adjustment for smoking or among those who had never smoked. Cigarettes were associated with increased ulcer risk in both stomach and duodenum but showed a dose-response in pack years only for gastric ulcer. We conclude that the association of reduced pulmonary function with peptic ulcer in the Japanese in Hawaii is largely attributable to smoking and that smoking is more strongly related to gastric than duodenal ulcer. The especially strong link between cigarettes and gastric ulcer suggests that decreased smoking or synchronous decrease in cigarette tar content may have contributed to the recent unexplained decrease in male gastric ulcer.\r"

In the present study immunoglobulins containing parietal cell antibodies were found to inhibit the activity of H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.36) in a tubulovesicular membrane preparation from porcine gastric mucosa. The degree of inhibition correlated to the titer of parietal cell antibodies as assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The specificity of the enzymatic inhibition was confirmed by the lack of effect of parietal cell antibodies on membrane-bound esterase. A possible interaction of parietal cell antibodies with gastrin binding at the receptor level was investigated in a radioreceptor assay employing 125I-gastrin 1 and gastric mucosal cell suspension from the guinea pig. No blocking capacity was found with immunoglobulins from patients with pernicious anemia as compared with immunoglobulins from healthy controls. The results thus demonstrate a direct inhibitory effect of parietal cell antibodies on the acid producing H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase of the parietal cell, but also a lack of interaction with the gastrin receptor, and indicate that in the development of hypo/achylia H+,K+-adenosine triphosphatase autoantibodies could have a major pathogenic role.\r"

  ".W": "In patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, serum gastrin level is increased by secretin and is decreased by somatostatin. To elucidate the cellular mechanism for these actions, we investigated the direct effects of secretin and somatostatin on dispersed gastrinoma cells from a patient with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, secretin significantly stimulated gastrin release from dispersed gastrinoma cells, which was inhibited by somatostatin. In the presence of guanosine 5'-triphosphate, furthermore, secretin enhanced adenylate cyclase activation in the membranes from these cells, and this activation was reduced by somatostatin, whereas neither secretin nor somatostatin affected inositol phospholipid turnover. On the other hand, removal of guanosine 5'-triphosphate from incubation medium abolished both the stimulatory effect of secretin and the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on adenylate cyclase activation. Furthermore, pertussis toxin pretreatment reversed the ability of somatostatin to inhibit secretin-induced increase in gastrin release and activation of adenylate cyclase. Thus, in this gastrinoma patient, secretin and somatostatin appeared to act directly on gastrinoma cells to stimulate and inhibit gastrin secretion, respectively, by modulating adenylate cyclase activation, probably via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins.\r"

The addition of glutathione- or protein-containing sulfhydryl groups such as pepsin to the medium decreased the fluorescence. Also, the increase in the pH of the medium decreased the fluorescence. The fluorescent molecule was identified to be an acid-activated planar cyclic sulfenamide derivative of omeprazole. The transformation was studied in H+-preaccumulated hog gastric vesicles, which contain the hydrogen ion transporting, potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. The addition of omeprazole to the vesicle suspension induced a rapid increase in the fluorescence intensity, indicating that omeprazole was activated in the intravesicular space. Then, the intensity biphasically decreased with time. The slower small decrease was due to the reaction of the sulfenamide with sulfhydryl group(s) located on the acid secretory side of the hydrogen ion transporting, potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase. Omeprazole was also activated in the acidic lumina of isolated rabbit gastric glands that were stimulated with histamine. Furthermore, direct evidence was obtained from the imaging of the fluorescence that omeprazole was activated in the acidic compartments of the isolated Xenopus oxyntic cell.\r"

  ".W": "The role of serosal bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) in protection against acid injury was investigated in rabbit esophageal mucosa mounted in Ussing chambers. Luminal acidification reduced potential difference and resistance in tissues exposed serosally to HCO3- or (unbuffered) HCO3-free solution. Whereas resistance declined similarly in both groups, potential difference declined less in HCO3- solution. After washout, HCO3-bathed tissues also had a greater increase in resistance, lower permeability to mannitol, and less histologic damage. Furthermore, as protection by HCO3- was not blocked by pretreatment with either the anion exchange blocker, 4 acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene 2-2'-disulfonic acid, or the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, acetazolamide, and replacement of HCO3- with N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethane sulfonic acid, a buffer impermeant to cells, was protective, an extracellular site for protection by HCO3- was likely. Where in the extracellular space HCO3- buffers H+ is unclear, but the absence of change in luminal pH and the inability to prevent the acid-induced increase in permeability in HCO3-bathed tissues argue against a luminal (preepithelial) site. Also, rapid repair was not demonstrated, indicating that a luminal site for protection after surface cell damage was unlikely. We conclude that serosal HCO3- is important in esophageal protection against acid damage by buffering H+ within the intercellular compartment of the extracellular space.\r"

The small intestine of the aging guinea pigs was longer, and (in the conditions of distention used) had a total serosal surface approximately 70% greater than in young adult animals. The spatial density of myenteric neurons per unit of serosal surface fell dramatically in aging animals, and the total number of myenteric neurons in the small intestine ranged between 1.1 and 1.6 million, i.e., it was only 40%-60% of the value obtained in young adult guinea pigs (2.75 million). The light microscope appearance of the neurons of the two groups of animals was markedly different and the suggestion is put forward that in aging guinea pigs the substantial reduction in neuron number is accompanied by structural changes and reorganization of the neurons that are left.\r"

In the present study, we examined the effect of N1,N2-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine, a specific irreversible inhibitor of polyamine oxidase, on the duodenal putrescine synthesis induced by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Addition of N1,N2-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine to an assay mixture completely inhibited the activity of duodenal polyamine oxidase in vitro. Prior administration of N1,N2-bis(2,3-butadienyl)-1,4-butanediamine to chicks completely blocked the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced increase in duodenal accumulation of putrescine in vivo. The increase of the duodenal accumulation of putrescine by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in vitamin D-deficient chicks coincided quantitatively with the amount of N1-acetylspermidine synthesized from spermidine after the injection of the vitamin into the chicks pretreated with the inhibitor of polyamine oxidase. These results clearly indicate that spermidine N1-acetyltransferase plays a preferential role in the increase in duodenal putrescine synthesis by 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. The rapidly proliferating and maturing epithelium of small intestines will provide a good model for investigating the role of the interconversion of polyamine metabolism in cell growth and differentiation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to investigate the site of neurotensin release and to determine whether neurotensin is released by direct luminal stimulation by fat in conscious dogs. Dogs were prepared with isolated jejunal or ileal segments and portal vein catheters. Release of neurotensin into the portal venous blood was examined by selective perfusion of each intestinal segment with sodium oleate. The results of this study show that selective perfusion of the jejunum, but not the ileum, with sodium oleate, caused a significant release of neurotensin. We speculate that release of ileal neurotensin is not due to direct luminal stimulation, but is mediated by local neural or humoral intermediates.\r"

  ".W": "The motility of the small intestine in unanesthetized rats receiving berberine sulfate (0.2, 2.0, and 20.0 mg/kg i.p.) was investigated. Motility was determined by two methods: myoelectric activity was monitored with indwelling bipolar electrodes, and intestinal transit was measured by the movement of radiochromium (Na51CrO4). The 20.0-mg/kg dose caused a marked inhibition of spike activity for 21.8 +/- 7.0 min and disrupted activity fronts of the migrating myoelectric complex for 212.3 min. Berberine, 2.0 mg/kg i.p., disrupted migrating myoelectric complexes for 64.6 min but spike inhibition was not observed. Transit of the small intestine was significantly (p less than 0.001) delayed at 15 and 100 min after the highest dose of berberine. Naloxone blocked the spike inhibition noted with 20.0 mg/kg of berberine but failed to improve transit. Phentolamine blocked spike inhibition and was associated with a significantly earlier return of activity fronts of the migrating myoelectric complex. Animals pretreated with this antagonist tended toward a higher geometric center in transit studies than those injected with berberine alone. Berberine was also administered by various routes (intraperitoneal injection, intravenous injection, orogastric gavage, and intraluminal injection). An intraperitoneal injection was 10-fold more potent than an intravenous injection. Orogastric gavage and intraluminal administration of berberine did not alter intestinal motility. In summary, berberine sulfate significantly inhibits myoelectric activity and transit of the small intestine. This appears to be partially mediated by opioid and alpha-adrenergic receptors. The antidiarrheal properties of berberine may be mediated, at least in part, by its ability to delay small intestinal transit.\r"

Cholera toxin and isobutylmethylxanthine, agents that elevate cyclic adenosine monophosphate, caused selective inhibition of collagen production when cells were exposed to these agents for 24-72 h. Exposure for 6 h inhibited noncollagen protein synthesis without effects on collagen production. Forskolin similarly inhibited collagen production, decreasing relative collagen synthesis 40% at 10 microM and 60% at 100 microM. After 48 h of exposure to cholera toxin and isobutylmethylxanthine, levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate had increased in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of cyclic nucleotide analogues was also examined. Dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate inhibited collagen production, whereas dibutyryl cyclic guanosine monophosphate increased collagen production by 65%. This effect was maximal at a concentration of 10 microM. These observations suggest that cyclic adenosine monophosphate has a significant effect on collagen production by human intestinal smooth muscle cells in vitro and may play a role in the modulation of collagen production by these cells in vivo.\r"

Ten patients with idiopathic hemochromatosis and two groups of controls (14 gallstone patients and 16 healthy subjects) were included. Liver tissue (obtained by percutaneous or operative biopsy) was investigated with light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy in combination with x-ray microanalysis. Fasting bile samples were obtained through duodenal aspiration or at cholecystectomy. Iron was determined in liver tissue and bile using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and ferritin was determined in serum and bile with a radioimmunoassay technique. All patients with hemochromatosis had iron-positive staining as seen in light microscopy. Electron microscopy showed iron-containing proteins in the lysosomes and cytosol of liver parenchymal cells, and this observation was supported by x-ray microanalysis. Hepatic iron concentration was increased about eightfold in the patients with hemochromatosis (p less than 0.001). Biliary iron concentration, expressed per millimole of bile acid, was increased about twofold (p less than 0.05) and biliary ferritin concentration about fivefold (p less than 0.001) in hemochromatosis. Four of the patients with hemochromatosis were reexamined after completed treatment with venesection; this resulted in normalized biliary concentrations of iron and ferritin. We conclude that biliary secretion of ferritin occurs in humans and that both iron and ferritin excretion are enhanced in hepatic iron overload. The apparently limited capacity of biliary iron excretion may be of importance for the hepatic iron accumulation in hemochromatosis.\r"

Furthermore, there was no evidence for an age-associated increase in bile salt deconjugation by intestinal bacteria as shown by the glycocholate breath test (n = 60). Finally, there was no evidence for a decrease in hepatic microsomal function with advancing age as measured by the aminopyrine breath test (n = 60). We conclude that digestive/absorptive and hepatic microsomal phase I monooxygenase function are well preserved in healthy humans throughout life.\r"

Jaundice was mainly associated with gram-negative infection, but did not influence survival. Duration of jaundice was dependent on control of the underlying infection. Liver function tests showed a severely deranged organic anion transport, whereas synthetic, cytosolic, and microsomal functions remained preserved. Our study shows that (a) the syndrome of jaundice associated with extrahepatic infection is a functional disorder that is reversible upon control of infection, and that (b) cytosolic, synthetic, and microsomal function is preserved. This may have consequences for both assessing prognosis and clinical management.\r"

In an attempt to avoid these side effects, 2000 upper diagnostic gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed in a period of 4 years between 1982 and 1986, without any sedation, using Olympus GIF-Q and GIF-P3 gastroscopes. Anxiety, ease of introduction of gastroscope, tolerance of the procedure, and the overall success of the procedure were assessed. Most patients were calm (81.2%); 94.4% had an easy introduction of the gastroscope, 80.3% tolerated the procedure well; and 94.2% of the endoscopies were completely successful. There were no complications, and only four examinations failed (0.2%). Sedation had to be used (intravenous diazepam) in 32 patients due to excessive anxiety and an inability to introduce the gastroscope and in three children under 10 years (1.6%). The average time needed to complete an endoscopy without sedation was found to be 9.5 min, nearly half of the average time needed before this study when sedation was routinely given. It is concluded that upper gastrointestinal endoscopy without sedation can be a safe, quick, well-tolerated procedure.\r"

DCPs were found in 315 patients (10.5%). Biopsy of these lesions showed them to be nonneoplastic in 187 patients (59.4%) and neoplastic in 128 (40.6%). Overall, 35% of all DCPs found were neoplastic. Gross appearance of the lesions was found to be an unreliable means of predicting their histologic makeup. Of the 128 patients with neoplastic DCPs, 73 underwent further examination with barium enema and colonoscopy. Synchronous lesions were found in 57.5%. In 10 patients, synchronous lesions were of significance, including carcinomas, adenomas greater than or equal to 8 mm in diameter, or severely dysplastic adenomas. We conclude that all DCPs discovered at sigmoidoscopy should be biopsied and in patients in whom DCPs are found to be neoplastic, colonoscopy should be undertaken to search for proximal synchronous lesions.\r"

Malfunction was caused by the catheter being encased in adhesions, being buried in small bowel, or being wrapped and occluded in omentum. In five of these cases we were successful in restoring catheter patency, thereby allowing immediate reinstitution of dialysis. Neither previous abdominal surgeries nor the length of time the catheter had been in place prior to malfunction appeared to be predictive for the cause of malfunction or the success of peritoneoscopic manipulation. We found outpatient peritoneoscopy to be safe and cost effective. We recommend it as the initial procedure to restore patency to malfunctioning CAPD catheters after conservative therapy has failed.\r"

Stent insertion was successful in 25 patients (86%), 23 of which have a mean follow-up of 19 months (range, 2 to 42 months) after stent removal. Seventy-four percent had an excellent (48%) or good (26%) response. Early postoperative strictures and fistulas responded favorably. We conclude that benign postoperative biliary strictures can be treated successfully by endoscopic prostheses.\r"

Vitamin C concentrations were significantly lower in those with hypochlorhydria (pH greater than 4; n = 23) compared with those with pH less than or equal to 4 (p less than 0.005) and there was a significant correlation between gastric juice and plasma concentrations (p = 0.002). Patients with normal endoscopic findings had significantly higher intragastric concentrations of vitamin C than those with gastric cancer (p less than 0.001), pernicious anaemia (p less than 0.005), gastric ulcer (p less than 0.01), duodenal ulcer (p less than 0.05), or after gastric surgery (p less than 0.01). There was a strong trend (0.05 less than p less than 0.1) towards lower intragastric concentrations of vitamin C in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis. In vitro, vitamin C concentrations remained stable in acidic but fell significantly over 24 hours in alkaline gastric aspirate. Gastric secretory studies in five volunteers showed that vitamin C concentrations increased significantly after intramuscular pentagastrin. These findings suggest that the low fasting levels of vitamin C in hypochlorhydric gastric juice may be caused by chemical instability and that vitamin C may be secreted by the human stomach.\r"

In the patients with bile reflux the occurrence of MMCs was decreased and median duration of the IDMC was significantly prolonged (group A = 162.5 min; group B = 185.0 min), compared with controls (group C = 92.0 min; p less than 0.01 v groups A and B). There were no differences in motility pattern between patients with and without gastritis, suggesting that motor abnormalities are not caused by gastritis, but may precede its occurrence. Delayed occurrence of motor activity fronts increases duodenogastric reflux, but correlation with gastric mucosal lesions was not shown, suggesting that other mechanisms are involved.\r"

  ".W": "Previous investigations of stress effects on gastric emptying, orocaecal, and colonic transit in rats have produced conflicting results. Here one type of stressor, a 'passive avoidance' situation, was used to investigate its effects on gastric emptying, orocaecal and colonic transit. After the rats had been trained to eat a standard amount of semisolid food, gastric emptying was determined (n = 12) by the food remaining in the stomach after various periods of rest, or stress exposure. Orocaecal transit (n = 14) was determined by breath hydrogen measurements after the food had been labelled with 1 g lactose. Colonic transit (n = 18) was measured as the arrival time of coloured faeces after infusion of a carmine red solution into the caecum through a chronically implanted catheter. The stressor had differential effects on transit through the stomach, small bowel and colon: gastric emptying was delayed (p less than 0.05) after stress (t1/2 = 2.66 h after stress, 1.97 h at rest). Orocaecal transit was accelerated (p less than 0.05) after stress; transit time decreased from 124.3 min at rest to 86.2 min after stress. Colonic transit was accelerated (p less than 0.01) under stress, from 15.5 h to 1.29 h. It is concluded that gastrointestinal transit in different parts of the gastrointestinal tract is differently affected by central nervous stimuli.\r"

In a retrospective review of 850 manometric tracings carried out in patients with unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or altered bowel movements, 16 tracings were identified with features suggestive of mechanical obstruction: prolonged simultaneous contractions (PC) and postprandial clustered contractions (CC). Three patients had CC lasting less than 20 minutes: none proved to have mechanical obstruction. Among seven patients with CC lasting more than 30 minutes, three had proven mechanical obstruction, one probable adhesion obstruction, and in three no obstruction was found. All three patients with PC and three with mixed PC and CC had mechanical obstruction. The obstructed intestine manifests a variety of pressure profiles in the proximal jejunum: PC, CC, or mixed patterns. Prolonged simultaneous contractions are suggestive of distal subacute bowel obstruction; CC lasting over 30 minutes are less specific, whereas CC lasting less than 20 minutes are not associated with obstruction.\r"

Two polar forms in a spectrum of gut mononuclear phagocyte types (CD11+) were identified: at the one extreme scavenger macrophages with blunted projections (AP+, Heca-452-, RFD1-) and at the other extreme, dendritic cells with long dendritic cytoplasmic projections (AP-, Heca-452+, RFD1+). Dendritic cells were mainly found in highly organised lymphoid tissue present at the deeper layers in the gut wall (normal gut: underneath the muscularis mucosae and T-cell areas of lymph follicles [25-30 per follicle]; surrounding the broad zone of scavenger macrophages at the bottom of ulcers (CIBD) and fissures (CD) and in the lymphoid aggregates [25-30 dendritic cells per aggregate] adjacent to granulomas (CD]. These observations can be taken as evidence that exaggerated antigen handling and presentation and stimulation of the immune response takes place at these foci. The observation that scavenger macrophages were localised more superficial, as band like zones (normal gut: subepithelial; mainly surrounding ulcers (CIBD) and fissures (CD] can be taken as evidence that at these spots the ingestion and degradation of foreign material takes place.\r"

  ".W": "The rectal expansion and concomitant sensory function on graded, isobaric, rectal distension within the interval 5-60 cm H2O was investigated in 36 healthy young volunteers. Anal pressure and electromyography (EMG) from the external anal sphincter were simultaneously recorded. Rectal distension caused an initial rapid expansion followed by transient, often repeated, reflex rectal contractions and a slow gradual increase of rectal volume. The maximal volume displaced by the first reflex rectal contraction was 18 (13) ml, which was less than 10% of the volume at 60 s. The pressure threshold for appreciation of rectal filling was 12 cm H2O (95% CL 5-15 cm H2O) and coincided with the threshold for rectoanal inhibition. Urge to defecate was experienced at 28 cm H2O (15-50 cm H2O) distension pressure, which was close to the threshold for maximal rectal contraction, also coinciding with the appearance of the external anal sphincter reflex. The interindividual variation of rectal volume on distension with defined pressures varied widely, indicating a considerable variation of rectal compliance in normal man. No correlation was found between rectal volume and sex or anthropometric variables. The relative variations in pressure thresholds for eliciting rectal sensation and rectoanal reflexes were less than the corresponding threshold volumes. It was concluded that the dynamic rectal response to distension reflects a well graded reflex adjustment ideal for a reservoir.\r"

The groups included eight animals each and were divided into the following treatment categories: control; ischaemia alone; ischaemia with subsequent reperfusion; ischaemia preceded by DFR, 60 mg/kg body weight; and reperfusion preceded by 20, 40, or 60 mg/kg DFR. The drug was given intravenously five minutes before either ischaemia or reperfusion. Malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation, and histopathological changes of liver tissue samples were used as indicators of hepatocellular injury. Lipid peroxidation (MDA concentration in mumol/kg liver tissue) was highest (4.76 (1.19] after ischaemia without reperfusion and less pronounced (2.87 (0.34] after reperfusion. Both concentrations, however, were significantly (p less than 0.05) higher than basal (control) values (1.78 (0.27]. At 60 mg/kg body weight, DFR treatment reduced MDA to basal or even lower concentrations in both situations (1.98 (0.08) and 1.26 (0.06), respectively) with a corresponding improvement in liver histopathology. Lower DFR doses were less protective. The data suggest that liver ischaemia is associated with free radical initiated, and apparently iron catalysed lipid peroxidation, which can be significantly decreased by iron chelation.\r"

  ".W": "In order to investigate the mechanisms underlying the hepatotoxicity associated with tienilic acid (Ticrynafen) ingestion we have looked for evidence of sensitisation to drug altered liver cell determinants using an indirect antibody dependent, cell mediated cytotoxicity assay (ADCC). As targets, hepatocytes were isolated from rabbits pretreated with either tienilic acid or its isomer with or without previous enzyme induction with either phenobarbitone or B-naphthoflavone (BNF). Sera from 16 of 36 patients with presumed tienilic acid hepatotoxicity induced significant cytotoxicity to hepatocytes isolated from rabbits pretreated with BNF and subsequently tienilic acid. Three of 10 sera from patients receiving tienilic acid but without overt liver damage also induced significant cytotoxicity to these hepatocytes, however, although none of 20 normal controls or of 16 patients with other liver diseases did so. Non-organ specific autoantibodies, classified as anti-LKM2, were also detectable. These were present in association with tienilic acid associated antibodies: of the 36 patients with presumed tienilic acid hepatotoxicity, 38% had both antibodies, 18% had only anti-LKM2 antibodies and 9% only tienilic acid associated antibodies. These results suggest that this drug reaction is associated with sensitisation to drug altered liver cell antigens and autoantigens. If ticrynafen associated hepatotoxicity is immune mediated, then one possible mechanism is that the drug induced antigens break tolerance, leading to an immune attack on normal liver cell components.\r"

Common bile duct stenosis was diagnosed in 16 (62%) of the 26 patients with successful cholangiography. Features of extrahepatic biliary obstruction were found on biopsy in 11 patients, three of whom showed features of secondary sclerosing cholangitis. No patients had secondary biliary cirrhosis. Three had parenchymal liver disease (cirrhosis, resolving hepatitis and alcoholic hepatitis respectively) and two others had features suggestive of previous alcohol-induced injury. Five (83%) of the patients with clinical jaundice had biopsy features of extrahepatic biliary obstruction, as did eight (67%) with alkaline phosphatase above twice normal and seven (44%) with radiological common bile duct stenosis. Neither alkaline phosphatase rise, nor common bile duct stenosis alone or in combination, were a reliable indication of the need for biliary enteric bypass surgery. Pre-operative liver biopsy may be a valuable adjunct in the assessment of such patients.\r"

One hundred and twenty one (95%) patients were followed up. Clearance was ultimately achieved endoscopically in 52 and surgically in 25 patients after (mean) 2.4 months. Thirty day mortality was 3%. There were no complications of nasobiliary drainage, but two of 39 patients treated by temporary stents developed cholangitis, both successfully managed by endoscopic duct clearance. Forty two patients unfit for surgery or further endoscopic attempts at duct clearance were followed with stents in situ for a mean 15.9 months (range 2.5-37.5). Cholangitis developed in four patients and was successfully managed by stent change. These results indicate that longterm stenting can be useful for poor risk surgical patients and that nasobiliary drainage or temporary stenting permits further elective rather than urgent endoscopic or surgical treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The present study investigated whether, in rats with portal hypertension due to cirrhosis of the liver induced by carbon tetrachloride, blood volume restitution following a hemorrhage produces an increase of portal pressure beyond control values, as observed in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. Since carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis caused mild portal-systemic shunting, in some of the cirrhotic rats (12 of 29 rats) portal-systemic shunting was enhanced by a transient (4 days) partial constriction of the portal vein, which was removed 1 week prior to the study. After baseline measurements of portal pressure and arterial pressure, 15 ml per kg of blood were withdrawn at a rate of 0.3 ml per min and reinfused 15 min later. After blood reinfusion, portal pressure and arterial pressure were measured again, and cardiac output, regional blood flows and portal-systemic shunting were determined using radioactive microspheres. Portal-systemic shunting was 78 +/- 11% of total blood flow in the cirrhotic rats that had temporary portal vein constriction, but only 5 +/- 2% (p less than 0.001) in those that did not. Blood volume restitution in low-portal-systemic shunting rats did not produce any significant modification in splanchnic or systemic hemodynamics. However, in rats with high portal-systemic shunting, blood volume restitution produced a significant increase in portal pressure (from 9.9 +/- 0.9 to 13.5 +/- 0.9 mmHg, p less than 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cirrhosis was induced by repeated intraperitoneal injections of carbon tetrachloride. The vasodilators were a nonselective beta-adrenergic antagonist (propranolol), an alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist (prazosin), a nonselective beta-adrenergic agonist (isoproterenol), an alpha 2-agonist (clonidine), nitrovasodilators (nitroglycerin and nitroprusside), calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine), papaverine, diazoxide and pentoxifylline. In basal conditions, isoproterenol, nitroglycerin, papaverine, pentoxifylline and nitroprusside demonstrated significant vasodilatory activity. However, the response was weak and isoproterenol was the only drug active in the therapeutic range of concentrations. Propranolol, prazosin, verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine and diazoxide were ineffective. Prazosin, papaverine and pentoxifylline reduced norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction, whereas isoproterenol, clonidine and propranolol were ineffective. We conclude that several vasodilators can reduce resistance in the cirrhotic rat liver, but their potency is low and few are effective at therapeutic concentrations. Furthermore, their activity may be blunted when resistance is increased by norepinephrine.\r"

Since the conversion to bile acids is an important pathway for the elimination of cholesterol, we studied primary bile acid kinetics in seven hyperthyroid patients before and after medical treatment. Pool sizes, fractional turnover and synthesis rates of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid were determined after oral administration of 50 mg [13C]cholic acid and 50 mg [13C]chenodeoxycholic acid. 13C/12C isotope ratios in serum were measured by capillary gas chromatography/electron impact mass spectrometry. Compared with the euthyroid state, serum cholesterol levels were distinctly lower in hyperthyroidism (150 +/- 33 vs. 261 +/- 51 mg per dl, p less than 0.01). Thyroid hormone excess caused a 34% reduction in cholic acid synthesis (5.8 +/- 2.8 vs. 7.9 +/- 4.2 mu moles per kg per day, p less than 0.02), which was associated with a 47% decrease in cholic acid pool size (11.7 +/- 3.4 vs. 22.0 +/- 5.2 mu moles per kg, p less than 0.01). Chenodeoxycholic acid kinetics exhibited no apparent changes. Thus, total primary bile acid synthesis was diminished by 20% in hyperthyroidism. After normalization of thyroid function, the ratio of cholic acid/chenodeoxycholic acid pool size increased in all patients. This was paralleled by a rise in the ratio of concentrations of cholic acid/chenodeoxycholic acid in serum. The depression of cholic acid synthesis in the presence of unaltered subjects is compatible with an inhibition of hepatic 12 alpha-hydroxylation by thyroid hormone. Furthermore, evidence is provided that, in man, the low serum cholesterol levels found during hyperthyroidism are not caused by an increased conversion of cholesterol to bile acid.\r"

In contrast, transport of cholyltaurine (taurocholate), a conjugated bile acid, is normal. Previous studies using normal rats have shown that C23 nor-dihydroxy bile acids are conjugated with sulfate or glucuronide during hepatic transport in contrast to the natural C24 bile acids, which are amidated with glycine or taurine. Studies were performed to test the hypothesis that (a) in the TR- rat, nordeoxycholate would be conjugated with glucuronate or sulfate just as in the normal rat, and (b) that such conjugates would have defective biliary secretion. [C23-14C]Nordeoxycholate was administered intravenously to bile fistula rats (TR- and normal), and the biliary recovery of metabolites was assessed by chromatography and mass spectrometry. In both groups of rats, the major biotransformation product of nordeoxycholate was the side chain (23-ester) glucuronide. Conjugation on the nucleus with sulfate and glucuronide at the 3-position (ethereal linkage) also occurred, as well as amidation at the C23 carboxylic acid group. In the mutant rats, biliary secretion of the 3-sulfate and 3-glucuronide conjugates was less than 10% and 1%, respectively, of that of normal rats, whereas biliary secretion of the 23-ester glucuronide and the 23-taurine amidate, as well as unchanged nordeoxycholate, was not decreased. Canalicular secretion of nor-bile acid 3-ether glucuronides and 3-sulfates appears to involve the \"bilirubin transport system,\" which is deficient in mutant rats. Canalicular secretion of unconjugated, amidated or esterified nordeoxycholate is mediated via another pathway, probably the \"bile acid transport system.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using a method which distinguishes trans- from paracellular access, we have examined the charge selectivity of biliary access pathways for the 40-kD protein horseradish peroxidase (pI 7.5), which was derivatized to strongly anionic (pI less than 3.5) and strongly cationic (pI greater than 9.5) isoenzymes. Each isoenzyme was injected as a bolus into the perfusate of an isolated rat liver perfused in situ with a nonrecirculating Krebs-Ringer buffer. Bile was collected at intervals and horseradish peroxidase activity was measured. Its appearance allowed differentiation of paracellular from transcellular access, and the amount entering via each pathway was quantified. The species of enzyme entering bile was the same as that injected as determined by cation-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography of biliary horseradish peroxidase. Paracellular biliary access of anionic horseradish peroxidase was less than 50% that of neutral and cationic horseradish peroxidase both in the control state and when paracellular entry was augmented with 10(-10) M vasopressin. Transcellular access of anionic horseradish peroxidase was similarly restricted. To determine whether this restriction of anionic transcellular access was brought about by diminished hepatocellular uptake or augmented catabolism, we studied these parameters in 4-hr primary hepatocyte cultures. The uptake rates of all species were similar. Little or no degradation or efflux of any horseradish peroxidase species occurred over 30 min in the cultured cells. We conclude that access is charge selective for macromolecules and that this selectivity holds for trans- as well as for paracellular pathways.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the vaccine trial, men found to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive at the time of enrollment and those men who had serologic evidence of new hepatitis B virus infection during follow-up were tested. In the sentinel counties study that determined risk factors for viral hepatitis in reported cases, all homosexual men with acute and chronic hepatitis B virus infections were tested for delta markers.

In seven different cities, among 321 men found to be HBsAg positive at the time of screening, eight (2%) were positive for any delta marker. Among 290 men with new hepatitis B virus infections during follow-up, three (two coinfections, one superinfection) had serologic evidence of delta hepatitis.

Intramuscular administration of tin-mesoporphyrin resulted, within 2 hr, in plasma concentrations identical to those obtained following i.v. administration, but the compound was not absorbed orally.

These patients were divided into three groups. Three patients had migraine-like headaches and transient hemiparesis associated with cocaine use. Five patients had headaches associated with cocaine withdrawal. In 29 patients headaches were not clearly associated with cocaine. Twenty-two of the 29 had chronic daily headaches; nine of these patients were depressed. Three had focal brain lesions with chronic daily headache or acute onset global headache. The four remaining patients had other headaches. Based on these findings, we conclude that: (1) Headache is a common complaint in hospitalized cocaine users; (2) Cocaine may occasionally trigger a syndrome which resembles hemiplegic migraine. The potential mechanisms of this syndrome will be discussed; (3) Hospitalized cocaine users who present with headaches most frequently have depression with suicidal ideation, often associated with cocaine withdrawal; and (4) Structural brain disease in these patients may result from a variety of causes.\r"

Each patient complained of pain and/or tenderness localized to the immediate vicinity of at least one TMJ. Pathologic joint effusion was demonstrated by MR in 88 of the painful joints studied. Significant meniscus displacement, with or without meniscus deformity and alteration of intrinsic signal intensity was present in 94 of the 100 painful joints examined. Fascial inflammation and atrophy of the ipsilateral muscles of mastication were observed occasionally with painful joints. There were no mechanical TMJ symptoms, such as joint clicking, crepitus or locking in 14 internally deranged and painful joints, 12 of which exhibited joint effusion and local inflammation. At least 80 patients described occlusal changes within 12 months of imaging. 28 of the pathologic joints in the series underwent subsequent meniscectomy, including routine histologic evaluation of surgical material. We conclude that internal derangement and inflammation of the TMJ should be considered in patients with unexplained headache and/or facial pain, even if mechanical TMJ symptoms are absent.\r"

We evaluated in different phases of the menstrual cycle and during the migraine crisis the peripheral plasma concentrations of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha (the stable metabolite of PGI2), thromboxane B2 (the stable metabolite of thromboxane A2), PGF2 alpha and PGE2. The mean values of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in menstrual migraine sufferers are lower than in normal women throughout the whole cycle. The difference between the trends observed in the two groups is statistically significant (p less than 0.05). The plasma levels of TXB2 and of PGF2 alpha are similar in the two groups investigated, both in basal conditions and during the attack. The plasma concentrations of PGE2 are slightly lower in migraineurs in basal conditions than in normals. However, during the crisis they increase significantly (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, among all the parameters considered, PGE2 seems to play the most important role during the pain phase of the attack. The results of the present study suggest that a deficit of PGI2, one of the most important protecting agents against ischemia, might be a typical feature of menstrual migraine and might cause in these patients a vascular hypersensitivity to different ischemic stimuli.\r"

We recorded long-latency auditory event related potentials (AEPs) in 30 unmedicated patients with common migraine, and compared them to 20 controls. 1,000 and 3,000 Hz tones were presented in an 80:20 ratio at 75 dB SL. 200 responses were recorded and replicated from Cz-A1 + A2, with filter band-pass of 1-100 Hz, analysis time of 1,000 ms., and interstimulus interval of 1.1 second. N100, P200, and N200 ERP components did not differ in latency or amplitude between migraine patients and controls. P300 was longer in latency among those with common migraine, and P300 amplitude was significantly reduced (P greater than 0.05). These findings suggest that migraine may have a central mechanism, and that migraineurs may have a difference in task involvement or perception which may influence their clinical course and response to therapy.\r"

Patients were divided into subgroups presenting common migraine (n = 38); ophthalmic migraine (n = 12); and tension headache associated with ophthalmic or common migraine (n = 24), and associated depressive status (n = 19). Statistical analysis revealed a decrease in plasma melatonin levels for the entire migraine population, compared to the control one, and a heterogeneity in both controls and patients; this heterogeneity was found mainly in the depressive and tension headache subgroups. When the migraine population--from which the depressive patients were excluded--was divided into male and female subgroups, a decrease in plasma melatonin levels was observed only for the female subgroups. Results are discussed with reference to the role of the pineal gland in the synchronization of the organism with the environmental conditions.\r"

To study in detail adrenocortical secretion during pregnancy, we measured plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, 11-deoxycortisol, cortisol, and cortisone simultaneously by RIA after extraction and automated Sephadex LH-20 chromatography of 10 normal pregnant women longitudinally throughout pregnancy at weeks 8-10, 14-17, 21-24, 28-32, and 38 as well as at the time of admission to the delivery room. The mean plasma progesterone and 17-hydroxy-progesterone concentrations increased from 37.2 +/- 6.5 (+/- SE) and 8.2 +/- 1.0 nmol/L, respectively, in early gestation to maximum levels of 138.0 +/- 25.7 and 22.8 +/- 2.2 nmol/L at week 38 (P less than 0.01). Plasma glucocorticoid levels rose 2- to 3-fold (P less than 0.01) from weeks 8-10 (corticosterone, 18.5 +/- 5.4; 11-deoxycortisol, 1.9 +/- 0.2; cortisone, 24.2 +/- 4.2; cortisol, 195.5 +/- 37.6 nmol/L) to week 38 (corticosterone, 42.9 +/- 11.2; 11-deoxycortisol, 4.6 +/- 0.5; cortisone, 71.5 +/- 13.6; cortisol, 420 +/- 63 nmol/L). Similarly, plasma mineralocorticoid levels increased 5- to 7-fold (P less than 0.01) from weeks 8-10 (11-deoxycorticosterone, 0.69 +/- 0.12; aldosterone, 0.41 +/- 0.08 nmol/L) to maximum levels at week 38 (5.3 +/- 0.9 and 2.1 +/- 0.3 nmol/L, respectively). At the time of admission to the delivery room, plasma 11-deoxycortisol, corticosterone, and cortisol concentrations were higher (P less than 0.02) than at 38 weeks, but plasma progestin and mineralocorticoid concentrations were not. We conclude that the source of the elevated maternal corticosteroid levels in pregnancy in addition to the estrogen-mediated rise in corticosteroid-binding globulin is the maternal adrenal cortex itself. The peak glucocorticoid levels at admission to the delivery room reflect increased maternal and fetal stress with the onset of labor.\r"

One third of the patients had elevated serum CgA levels; 2 of these patients had nonsecreting pituitary tumors, and the other 3 had corticotroph adenomas. CgA-positive cells were detected in 9 of the 11 anterior pituitary tumors that were immunostained; in these 9 tumors at least half of the cells were CgA positive. We conclude that CgA production is common in pituitary tumors and that immunohistochemical studies for CgA may aid in their classification. In addition, serum CgA measurements may help to identify patients with pituitary tumors, especially those that do not secrete a known pituitary peptide.\r"

A heat-induced isomerization then converts previtamin D3 to vitamin D3 over a period of days. A number of irradiation products of vitamin D3 are known to form upon irradiation with high intensity UV radiation, but the effect of subsequent exposures to sunlight on the vitamin D3 formed in skin is not known. To investigate this phenomenon, human skin containing vitamin D3 was exposed to sunlight in Boston. A model system of [3H]vitamin D3 in methanol was also used to study the effects of sunlight on vitamin D3 throughout the year. Vitamin D3 proved to be exquisitely sensitive to sunlight, and once formed in the skin, exposure to sunlight resulted in its rapid photodegradation to a variety of photoproducts, including 5,6-transvitamin D3, suprasterol I, and suprasterol II.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of familial benign hypercalcemia (FBH) is unknown. Possible explanations for the disorder include a set-point error in parathyroid gland regulation and intrinsic renal hyperreabsorption of calcium. Thus, FBH may involve an alteration in cellular calcium transport, especially in renal and parathyroid cells. A primary mediator of cellular calcium transport is (Ca2+,Mg2+)ATPase. Therefore, we examined in detail the kinetics of (Ca2+,Mg2+)ATPase activity in erythrocyte plasma membranes from 11 patients with FBH from 7 families, 5 patients with untreated primary hyperparathyroidism, and equal numbers of age- and sex-matched normal subjects. (Ca2+,Mg2+)ATPase activity was measured in isolated membranes as a function of free calcium (0.05-300 mumol/L) in the presence or absence of calmodulin (600 nmol/L) and as a function of calmodulin (0-1800 nmol/L). We found no significant differences in calcium- or calmodulin-dependent (Ca2+,Mg2+)ATPase kinetics between patients with FBH or primary hyperparathyroidism and their age- and sex-matched normal subjects. None of the kinetic parameters was correlated with serum calcium or serum PTH values. We postulate that a mechanism other than a global defect in (Ca2+,Mg2+)ATPase activity is responsible for the hypercalcemia in patients with FBH.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the characteristics of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors in plasma membrane fractions derived from normal and diseased human thyroid tissues. The mean maximal specific binding of EGF to membrane fractions of normal thyroid tissue (n = 25) was 1.46 +/- 0.47 (+/- SD) fmol/mg protein. The maximal specific binding was higher than the upper limit of the normal range (2.40) in 12 of the 39 (31%) differentiated carcinomas, 2 of the 3 (67%) undifferentiated carcinomas, and 1 squamous cell thyroid carcinoma. In contrast, the maximal specific binding in samples derived from adenomas (1.13 +/- 0.91), adenomatous goiters (0.92 +/- 0.56), and hyperplastic (Graves') thyroids (1.57 +/- 0.61) was not different from that in normal thyroid tissue. Scatchard plot analysis revealed that all thyroid membrane fractions had two classes of specific receptors for EGF. The mean association constant for the high affinity EGF receptors in normal thyroid tissue was 7.9 +/- 2.9 (+/- SD) X 10(9) mol/L-1, and the capacity was 22.9 +/- 7.0 fmol/mg protein. The capacity of the high affinity receptors was higher (P less than 0.05) in differentiated carcinoma (37.2 +/- 25.5) and undifferentiated carcinoma (32.7 +/- 11.6) than in normal thyroid tissue. In one squamous cell carcinoma, the capacities for the two classes of binding sites were about 15-fold greater than in normal thyroid tissue. In contrast, the association constants of the high affinity receptors from carcinomas (differentiated, 6.9 +/- 2.8; undifferentiated, 11.8 +/- 4.1; squamous cell, 8.2) were similar to that of normal thyroid tissue. In the thyroid tissues from eight patients with Graves' disease the capacity of the high affinity binding sites (37.5 +/- 12.3 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that in normal tissue, but the affinity (4.4 +/- 1.6 X 10(9) mol/L-1) was less, and the maximal specific binding was similar in the two types of tissue. These results suggest that a significant increase in the number of high affinity EGF receptors may play a role in the pathogenesis of human thyroid carcinoma.\r"

This therapy, given in doses ranging from 100-600 micrograms/day, resulted in normalization of the mean daily serum GH (mGH) and insulin-like growth factor I levels in 9 of the 17 patients (53%). In 7 patients, mean daily serum GH decreased but not to normal; 3 of these patients had hyperprolactinemia which was not influenced by octreotide. One patient was completely unresponsive. In contrast to the biochemical results, 80% of the patients had marked clinical improvement. Side-effects consisted of slightly impaired carbohydrate tolerance in 2 patients and cholelithiasis in 2 patients. Pituitary tumor size decreased in only 3 patients; in 1 of them visual field defects disappeared rapidly. These results suggest that octreotide treatment may prove beneficial before surgery in patients with macroadenomas, although its efficacy varies widely. Potential responsivity can usually be determined by a short course (24 h) of CSI of octreotide.\r"

Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is a component of this fraction that binds both steroids, but the fraction may contain another component that binds only estrogen. We used several chromatographic methods to ascertain whether the estradiol-binding properties of the mannoglycoprotein fraction could be attributed to SHBG or to SHBG and the putative estrogen-binding protein. DEAE-trisacryl, chromatofocusing, and anti-SHBG-immunoglobulin Sepharose chromatography resulted in coelution of the androgen- and estrogen-binding activities. SHBG purified by ligand affinity chromatography as well as immunoaffinity-purified SHBG had estradiol-binding properties similar to those of the crude mannoglycoprotein preparation. These data strongly suggest that 1) SHBG is the only estradiol-binding protein in the mannoglycoprotein fraction obtained by Concanavalin-A chromatography of human serum, and 2) the putative estradiol-binding protein of serum is most likely SHBG.\r"

  ".W": "The circadian pattern of plasma PRL levels and the PRL response to suckling were examined at various times during the first postpartum year and related to the length of lactational amenorrhea. Ten healthy women whose infants were breast-fed exclusively and who were amenorrheic 3 months postpartum were studied 3, 6, and 9-11 months postpartum. The women and their babies were admitted to a metabolic unit for 48 h. On the second day, blood samples were drawn at 2-h intervals for 26 h starting at 0800 h and also 10 and 30 min after the initiation of six of the nursing episodes. During the three postpartum periods, there was a circadian rhythm of basal plasma PRL concentrations; the peak concentrations occurred between 2400-0600 h. Suckling induced a significant rise in plasma PRL levels at all hours except 0800 h. There was a positive correlation between the duration of the nursing episode and the suckling-induced PRL increase at 30 min. Both the basal plasma PRL levels and the PRL responses to suckling diminished with time after delivery. This trend was less evident at 0400 h and was not fully explained by changes in the nursing pattern. The five women in whom menstrual cycles resumed before day 180 postpartum had lower basal and suckling-induced plasma PRL levels than the women who had amenorrhea for a longer period. This difference was present in the third month, when all women were amenorrheic and fully nursing and when the frequency and duration of nursing episodes and infant growth rates were similar. The results indicate that comparable nursing patterns may be associated with different plasma PRL levels, which are associated with different lengths of lactational amenorrhea. An early difference in the sensitivity of the breast-hypothalamus-pituitary system to suckling may explain the differences in the duration of lactational amenorrhea, which are not dependant on the breastfeeding pattern. The magnitude of the PRL response to suckling may predict the likelihood of recovering ovarian function during lactation.\r"

Daily hair volume production was calculated from the diameter and daily growth rate; it was reduced to 60% (P less than 0.01) on the face, 52% (P less than 0.01) on the arm, 34% (P less than 0.001) on the abdomen, and 48% (P less than 0.001) on the thigh. Six of the 18 women who completed the study developed midcycle vaginal bleeding, and 3 women had previously irregular menstrual cycles regulated.

The PTH concentration of a liver metastasis was 503.5 ng/g wet wt (normal liver, less than 4.2-5.9), and the PTH in the tumor extract eluted at nearly the same position as synthetic human PTH-(1-84) on gel filtration chromatography. Northern blot analysis revealed PTH mRNA in the tumor as a single band of 0.9 kilobase. These results indicate that the ectopic PTH production by the lung cancer was the cause of hypercalcemia in this patient.\r"

This observation suggests that big big PRL is immunologically similar, but biologically less active, than monomeric or little PRL. In this study we determined the molecular size heterogeneity of immunoreactive PRL in the serum from two ovulatory hyperprolactinemic women (subjects A and B) who had large amounts of serum big big PRL during a menstrual cycle and/or gestation. Serum samples obtained throughout the menstrual cycle (days 6, 10, 14, 17, 23, and 28, taking as day 1 the first day of bleeding) and pregnancy (weeks 7, 9, 11, 15, 20, 25, 30, 34, and 38) were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography. PRL was identified in column eluates by specific RIA. Two additional pregnant women, one with a bromocriptine-treated PRL-secreting adenoma (subject C), and a normal woman (subject D) were studied. Big big PRL was the predominant species throughout the different phases of the menstrual cycle in subject B, comprising 70-80% of the total immunoreactive PRL. Most of the remainder was big PRL, and little PRL was present in only small amounts (6-12%) during the luteal phase. During their pregnancies, the serum PRL in subjects A and B initially was mostly big big PRL, but later in gestation the PRL composition shifted from the high mol wt variants to little PRL. The infant's cord (subject A) and peripheral (subject B) serum at birth contained appreciable quantities of big big and big PRL, respectively. These results indicate that structural changes in PRL occur during pregnancy and the menstrual cycle which are probably influenced by the hormonal environment. In addition, the occurrence of larger mol wt PRL species in the serum of the infant of a hyperprolactinemic mother suggests that the presence of high proportions of big big PRL in the serum is genetically determined.\r"

Plasma ACTH and lipotropin levels and 24-h urinary cortisol excretion were greatly elevated [218 pg/mL (48 pmol/L), 1340 pg/mL (220 pmol/L), and up to 830 micrograms/24 h (2290 nmol/day), respectively]. Urinary cortisol excretion decreased to normal within 3 days after the initiation of octreotide therapy (150, 300, and 600 micrograms/day), and plasma ACTH and lipotropin levels also decreased. Urinary cortisol excretion remained normal for 2 months during chronic octreotide therapy, and her general condition improved dramatically. The only side-effect was a slight increase in the number of bowel movements. Tumor progression, however, was not controlled, and she eventually died of hepatic insufficiency. These data indicate that octreotide can be a highly effective treatment for patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome.\r"

To determine if somatostatin is present in the male reproductive system, we analyzed human testis, epididymis, prostate, and semen. Somatostatin-like immunoreactivity was detectable in acid extracts of human testis, epididymis, and prostate (n = 6 each) in concentrations of 4.0 +/- 1.4 (+/- SD), 14.7 +/- 3.2, and 27.5 +/- 5.1 pmol/g wet wt, respectively. Considerable amounts of immunoreactive somatostatin also were detectable in semen; the mean value was 3.8 +/- 1.3 nmol/L (n = 6). This value was 200-fold higher than that in peripheral plasma. The somatostatin immunoreactivity in these tissues was characterized by gel filtration chromatography. Two peaks of somatostatin immunoreactivity, one coeluting with somatostatin-14 and the other with somatostatin-28, were found in the testis, epididymis, prostate, and hypothalamus. The amounts of the two sizes were nearly equal in the testis; somatostatin-14 predominated in the epididymis, prostate, and hypothalamus; whereas only somatostatin-28 was detected in semen. The presence of somatostatin in the male reproductive system suggests that somatostatin may play a role in the regulation of reproductive function in men.\r"

Similar calculations were also made on the ileal mucosa away from the tumour of 10 patients with ileal carcinoids and 10 controls. In the stomach, the argyrophil cell counts were twice as high in the patients with pernicious anaemia than in controls and the densities in the whole mucosa or in the epithelial structures were similarly three to five times higher. The cell counts in the patients showed positive correlation with the serum gastrin concentration. The patients with nodular argyrophil cell hyperplasia and gastric carcinoids formed a uniform group with the highest cell counts and serum gastrin concentrations; the difference between the groups was in the longer duration of pernicious anaemia in the patients with carcinoid tumours. On the other hand, no endocrine cell hyperplasia was seen in those with ileal carcinoids. It is concluded that fundal mucosal endocrine cells show an increase in patients with pernicious anaemia that is related to the gastrin concentration. This phenomenon may favour the development of hyperplastic endocrine cell nodules and, eventually, carcinoid tumours.\r"

Atypical hyperplasia was found in 10 (20%) of 20-29 year old men and in 12 (24%) of 30-40 year old men. The prostates with atypical hyperplasia had similar weights as those without, and the atypical hyperplasia was most common in the lateral lobes of the prostate and near the apex. The atypical hyperplasias were (i) usually mild in degree rather than moderate or severe; (ii) almost equally divided between circumscribed and \"infiltrating\" lesions; (iii) usually occurred as multiple foci within the same prostate rather than as a single focus of atypical hyperplasia; and (iv) were not associated with inflammation. The finding that atypical hyperplasia is common in men between the ages of 20 and 40 years may be helpful in increasing the understanding of the histopathology of the prostate.\r"

The tumours were classified as follows: whether oral contraceptives had been used at any time; and whether oral contraceptives had been used before first term pregnancy. All analyses were adjusted for the effects of age. Overall, 201 (88.5%) of tumours were infiltrating ductal in type, 19 (8.4%) were infiltrating lobular, and seven (3.1%) were in situ ductal. Of the infiltrating ductal tumours, 28 (14%) were grade I 88 (44%) grade II, and 84 (42%) grade III. Various other tumour characteristics were also examined (per cent of carcinoma in situ, lymphatic permeation, necrosis, lymphoplasmocytic reaction and tumour edge). None of the histopathological features assessed showed any significant association with oral contraceptive use. Some characteristics of the areas of breast tissue adjacent to the tumours were also studied. The degree of cyst formation was considerably less pronounced in those using oral contraceptives before first term pregnancy than in those not doing so.\r"

The osteoporosis was of varying aetiology and was clinically stable. All patients were given tetracycline before biopsy and double tetracycline labelling was used in seven patients. Bone forming and resorbing surfaces were defined by the presence of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respectively, which were identified by histochemical techniques. The associations between bone forming and resorbing surfaces were similar in patients and controls, though the range of values was wider in the patients than in the controls. Mineral apposition rate was normal in the osteoporotic patients, but there was a reduction in mineralising (tetracycline) surface, whether related to osteoid surface or to osteoblast surface. This did not indicate osteomalacia as the directly and indirectly measured mineralisation lag times were normal. The osteoid seams were thinner in osteoporotic patients than in controls. The data suggest that osteoclast and osteoblast numbers were normal in this group of osteoporotic patients but that the metabolic activity of osteoblasts was impaired.\r"

In the direct method red cells suspended in choline chloride were centrifuged through dibutyl phthalate, which removes plasma adherent to the cells. A haemolysate is made of the sedimented red cells. The lithium concentration of this was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. There are many conflicting reports about the value of red cell lithium, and methodological problems have been proposed as a reason for this. It is suggested that the simpler, more precise direct method described here should be used in future.\r"

The distribution of pemphigus vulgaris antibodies already bound to the keratinocytes in early acantholytic lesions was detected with ferritin-conjugated goat antihuman IgG. Ferritin particles were observed on the surface of keratinocytes with particular affinity for desmosomal structures. The acantholytic cells in the blister fluid bound only a small number of ferritin particles on their surface. During incubation at 37 degrees C, pemphigus vulgaris antigen-antibody complexes on the surface of separated desmosomes were internalized and recognized in cytoplasmic vesicles. Endocytosis of separated desmosomes also was observed in vivo when freshly obtained epidermal sheets were immediately processed for routine electron microscopic study. These findings suggest that pemphigus vulgaris antibodies are densely located on desmosomes and that the antigen-antibody complexes, together with other serum proteins on the keratinocyte surface, are internalized by a process of endocytosis.\r"

The natural killer cell activity was measured at the zero, sixth, twelfth, and eighteenth hours of the day. The results demonstrated that patients with vitiligo had significantly higher natural killer cell activity compared with normal controls. When patients with static and active vitiligo were compared, those with the static form had increased natural killer cell activity at all times except noon, whereas those with active form had increased natural killer cell activity only at 0600 and 1800. These changes shifted the acrophase of the circadian rhythm of each group. Indeed, by cosinor analysis, both patients with vitiligo and normal controls had similar circadian rhythms, but the acrophase was shifted from 0602 in control subjects to 0435 in the ten patients with vitiligo. The acrophase in the six patients with active vitiligo was found to be closest to that of normal controls (0508). These findings indicate that natural killer cell activity abnormalities are more marked in the static rather than in the active form of vitiligo.\r"

Analysis of data showed 37% of patients had sun-reactive skin type I, 27% had type II, and 36% had type III. Types IV through VI were not represented. There appeared to be an overrepresentation of types I and II. Increased melanin pigmentation may therefore be either directly or indirectly protective against the development of skin cancers in patients who have received low-dose superficial ionizing radiation for benign disease. The sun-reactive skin type of patients with chronic radiation dermatitis may be used as a predictor of skin cancer risk when the total dose of ionizing radiation is not known.\r"

UVA doses were given to sunscreen-protected and unprotected skin with the use of irradiance values of 50 mW/cm2 and 100 mW/cm2. Erythemal responses were evaluated 5.2 +/- 0.9 hours later and again 24.4 +/- 1.8 hours later. The overall mean unprotected UVA minimal erythema dose (MED) was 23.6 joules/cm2 (SD = 4.8) and the mean UVA protection factor (APF) was 3.2 (SD = 0.78). Neither irradiance nor evaluation time significantly affected MED or APF. These preliminary findings indicate that the modified solar simulator permits convenient determination of sunscreen APF. The APF of a sunscreen is analogous to SPF: APF refers to UVA protection, while SPF refers to protection from the entire solar spectrum, predominantly from the effects of UVB.\r"

However, normalization of barrier function has not been routinely assessed in studies of occlusive dressing effects on wound healing. We examined the effects of occlusive dressings on the reestablishment of the cutaneous barrier to transepidermal water loss (TEWL) after standardized skin wounds were produced in human subjects. We confirmed previous observations that occlusive dressings augment reepithelialization. No significant improvement in the rate of reestablishment of the barrier to TEWL was measured between the covered test or uncovered control sites in each subject, however. TEWL declined in an exponential fashion after wounding. Measurements of TEWL were over twice that of adjacent normal skin when epithelialization was judged to be overtly complete and did not return to normal until 4 weeks after wounds were produced.\r"

Ten patients with AIDS-related seborrheic dermatitis were studied for the presence of Pityrosporum organisms. On the basis of a quantitative correlation between numbers of yeast cells adherent to and extruded from keratinocytes and the clinical severity of seborrheic dermatitis, an association, if not a causative role, for Pityrosporum is strongly suggested in seborrheic dermatitis in patients with AIDS. This association was further strengthened by the marked clinical response to ketoconazole in two patients with a concomitant decrease in the number of Pityrosporum cells per keratinocyte.\r"

Betamethasone valerate products could be separated into two distinct categories, and triamcinolone acetonide products could be grouped into three categories of activity. A survey of local pharmacies showed that generic substitution would be made for the prescribed brand of betamethasone valerate in 58% of cases and for the prescribed triamcinolone acetonide 75% of the time. Because of the prevalence of generic substitution of products that may not have equivalent bioavailability, some standardization of the bioavailability of topical products is needed.\r"

  ".W": "A unilateral rosacea-like chronic dermatitis of the right side of the face was shown to harbor innumerable Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis. Treatment with oral metronidazole suppressed the dermatitis but did not significantly reduce the Demodex population. Treatment with topical crotamiton eliminated the Demodex and was curative. These observations support the view that D. folliculorum and D. brevis may be pathogenic when they are present in extremely large numbers.\r"

Both cases suggested a clinical diagnosis of Mondor's disease (i.e., sclerosing periphlebitis of the chest wall) with atypical aspects. The histologic picture showed a diffuse dermal infiltrate, predominantly of eosinophils mixed with lymphocytes and histiocytes, with some evidence of collagen degeneration. No flame figures were seen. Problems of differential diagnosis are discussed.\r"

The patient had a 9-year history of multiple keratotic papules and comedo-like pits on the medial border of the left foot. Light- and electron microscopic studies showed multiple cornoid lamella-like parakeratotic columns, which invariably were associated with hyperplastic eccrine ostia and distal sweat ducts. It is concluded that this entity, the first reported case of adult-onset porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, is a variant of the congenital form described previously by Abell and Read and by Aloi and Pippione.\r"
