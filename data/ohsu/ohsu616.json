  ".W": "The interactions of 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone (16 alpha-OHE1), a metabolite of estradiol (E2), with estrogen receptors (ERs) were compared in this study to the classic E2-receptor mechanism in human breast cancer cells MCF-7 in culture. When MCF-7 cells were incubated with radioinert 16 alpha-OHE1 or its 3H-labeled form for 4 weeks, the estrogen bound extensively and irreversibly in a time-dependent fashion to nuclear protein species that correspond to the ER. Here we show that the interactions of 16 alpha-OHE1 with the ER are different from those of E2 with the receptor. Dissociation of tritiated E2-ER or 16 alpha-OHE1-ER complexes, salt extraction, DNase and proteinase K digestion, and ethanol treatment demonstrated that the binding of 16 alpha-OHE1 to the ER corresponds to two different forms: a classical noncovalent interaction similar to that of E2, and a covalent adduct formation between the metabolite and the ER. These complexes localized preferentially in nuclear matrix components as revealed by cell fractionation and probing with a monoclonal anti-ER antibody. [3H]16 alpha-OHE1-ER complexes analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated a radiolabeled band at approximately 66 kDa that was absent when the exposure of cells was done in the presence of E2 in competition and that was also absent in [3H]E2 incubations. The present results when considered together with our previous findings of elevated activities of estrogen 16 alpha-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for the formation of 16 alpha-OHE1, in breast cancer patients and in women at enhanced risk for the disease, suggest that covalent modification of the ER may be one mechanism of malignant transformation in estrogen target tissues.\r"

These titration curves were used to measure the resting pH of human muscle in vivo, 7.01 x 0.04 (C-2 proton) and 6.97 +/- 0.10 (C-4 proton). An in vivo titration curve of the C-2 proton resonance was determined by interleaving 1H and 31P NMR spectra after exhaustive exercise, during which muscle pH recovers from an acidic value of 6.1. We observed excellent agreement between the pH values as determined by the C-2 resonance of carnosine and that of inorganic phosphate. Carnosine provides an excellent pH indicator since (i) its concentration is relatively stable and (ii) it allows measurement of proton metabolites and pH to be achieved through the same coil, thus enabling a better signal/noise ratio and better localization.\r"

The other two residues of the triad, His-57 and Asp-102, are otherwise absolutely conserved in all the viral protease sequences. Secondary structure analysis of aligned sequences suggests the location of the component strands of the twin beta-barrel trypsin fold in the viral proteases. Unexpectedly, the 2a and 3c subclasses of viral cysteine proteases are, respectively, homologous to the small and large structural subclasses of trypsin-like serine proteases. This classification allows the molecular mapping of residues from viral sequences onto related tertiary structures; we precisely identify amino acids that are strong determinants of specificity for both small and large viral cysteine proteases.\r"

Cholate/urea-solubilized membranes were fractionated on a Sepharose 6B column and transport activity was recovered in the column void volume. Centrifugation of the void volume fraction at 105,000 X g and reextraction of the pellet with 1% octyl glucoside led to recovery of an extract whose specific transport activity was nearly 30-fold higher than that of the original solubilized extract with a recovery of 38% of the original activity. The properties of amino acid uptake in the purified reconstituted transporter were identical to those in native plasma membrane vesicles. The major component present in the purified fraction had a molecular mass of 120-130 kDa. Strong evidence that this 120- to 130-kDa peptide contains a component of the amino acid transporter was obtained by immunoprecipitation of transport activity from solubilized membranes with an antibody against the 120- to 130-kDa peptide. This study tentatively identifies a component of the Na+-dependent amino acid transporter as a peptide with an apparent molecular mass of 120-130 kDa.\r"

We provide evidence that suggests that the virus-encoded sigma 3 protein is likely responsible for this kinase inhibitory activity. We could not detect activation of the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase in extracts prepared from either interferon-treated or untreated reovirus serotype 1-infected mouse L cells under conditions that led to activation of the kinase in extracts prepared from either interferon-treated or untreated, uninfected cells. Extracts from reovirus-infected cells blocked activation of kinase in extracts from interferon-treated cells when the two were mixed prior to assay. The kinase inhibitory activity in extracts of reovirus-infected cells could be overcome by adding approximately 100-fold excess of dsRNA over the amount required to activate kinase in extracts of uninfected cells. Kinase inhibitory activity in extracts of interferon-treated, virus-infected cells could be overcome with somewhat less dsRNA (approximately 10-fold excess). Most of the inhibitory activity in the extracts could be removed by adsorption with immobilized anti-reovirus sigma 3 serum or immobilized dsRNA, suggesting that the dsRNA-binding sigma 3 protein is necessary for kinase inhibitory activity. Purified sigma 3 protein, when added to reaction mixtures containing partially purified kinase, inhibited enzyme activation. Control of activation of this kinase, which can modify eukaryotic protein synthesis initiation factor 2, may be relevant to the sensitivity of reovirus replication to treatment of cells with interferon and to the shutoff of host protein synthesis in reovirus-infected cells.\r"

An important consequence of the activation of these pathways is the stimulation of gene transcription by way of interactions of specific proteins with DNA control elements. The 8-base-pair (bp) DNA consensus sequence TGACGTCA [cAMP response element (cAMP-RE)] has been shown to confer cAMP responsivity on transcription from various promoters, and the closely related 7-bp consensus sequence TGA-(C or G)TCA [phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate response element (PMA-RE)] lends transcriptional responsiveness to phorbol esters. In the JEG-3 placental cell line we find that several variants of the cAMP-REs fused to a gonadotropin alpha promoter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene mediate responsiveness to cAMP but not to phorbol esters. The PMA-RE is responsive to phorbol esters but also imparts submaximal sensitivity to cAMP in the JEG-3 cells and in the Hep G2 hepatoma cell line. The transcriptional activities of cAMP-RE and PMA-RE are markedly influenced by the composition of the neighboring bases, but different sequences are permissive for the activity of the cAMP-RE versus the PMA-RE. The two signaling agents together display a supraadditive effect on reporter genes containing active PMA-REs but not cAMP-REs. Gel-mobility-shift and UV cross-linking analyses show that distinct proteins bind to the two control elements. One protein of 38 kDa binds to the cAMP-RE and several proteins of 48-84 kDa bind to the PMA-RE.\r"

In organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, synthesis of these proteins is directly correlated with the acquisition of thermotolerance. While studying the freshwater coelenterate hydra, we observed that Hydra oligactis was extremely sensitive to thermal stress. In contrast, the related species Hydra attenuata survives short-term exposure to high temperatures. Furthermore, after incubation at an elevated but nonlethal temperature, H. oligactis did not become thermotolerant. H. attenuata, however, acquired thermotolerance after such a preincubation. In H. attenuata the major heat shock protein was found to be 60 kDa in size. H. oligactis did not synthesize detectable levels of this protein or any new species of proteins in response to stress. Several other species of hydra were found to behave like H. oligactis in response to stress. Thus, these findings provide direct support for the hypothesis that heat shock proteins are required for stress tolerance and that the major heat shock protein in hydra does not have any effects on normal growth or physiology. The findings also indicate that the presence of a heat shock response might be related to the natural environment in which an organism lives.\r"

The 22-nt sequence does not appear to be encoded near the 63-kDa genes but is present in multiple copies in several locations within the parasite genome, including the 5S rRNA gene repeat. The 5S-linked copies of the 22-nt sequence are transcribed to yield a 109-nt nonpolyadenylated RNA with the 22-nt leader sequence at its 5' end. We suggest that the 22-nt leader is acquired by 63-kDa antigen mRNAs through trans-splicing. These results indicate that trans-splicing is widespread in nematodes and argue for the functional significance of the 22-nt spliced leader exon in nematode mRNA metabolism.\r"

Translation over the sequence yields a 50% ribosomal frameshift if the reading phase is A-AGG-AGG-U. The other two possible frames do not give shifts. The introduction of a UAA stop codon before (UAA-AGG-AGG-U) but not after (A-AGG-AGG-UAA) the AGG codons abolishes the frameshift. The change in the reading phase occurs exclusively to the +1 direction. Efficient frameshifting is also induced by the sequence A-AGA-AGA-U. The arginine codons AGG and AGA are read by minor tRNA. Suppression of frameshifting takes place when a gene for minor tRNA(Arg) is introduced on a multicopy plasmid. We suggest that frameshifting during translation of the A-AGG-AGG-U sequence is due to the erroneous decoding of the tandem AGG codons and arises by depletion of tRNA(Arg). The complementarity of tandem AGG codons to the 3' terminus of 16S rRNA is a coincidence and apparently not related to the shift. Replacing the AGG-AGG sequence by the optimal arginine codons CGU-CGU does not increase the overall rate of translation.\r"

NS consists of a highly acidic NH2-terminal domain and a basic COOH-terminal domain. Unlike the latter, the amino acid sequences of the NH2-terminal regions are highly dissimilar among different viral serotypes, although they share structural similarities. We have cloned an NS gene into the SP6 transcription vector and replaced the 5'-terminal 80% by a full-length gene for beta-tubulin, which contains an acidic COOH-terminal domain. Here we present evidence that the chimeric tubulin-NS protein is biologically active and that the acidic region in tubulin directly affects the transcription reaction. These observations indicate that NS probably functions as an activator protein in which the acidic domain stimulates transcription of the viral genes by interacting with the RNA polymerase as observed for eukaryotic cellular transcription activators.\r"

  ".W": "Extracellular ATP in its tetra-anionic form (ATP4-) induces ion fluxes and membrane depolarization in the mouse macrophage-like cell line J774.2 and in resident mouse macrophages. We analyzed the effects of extracellular ATP4- by both patch-clamp and intracellular microelectrode techniques. Whole-cell patch-configuration membrane potential measurements on J774.2 cells revealed that ATP4- -induced depolarization occurred within 40 ms of pulsed application of ATP and was completely reversible. The depolarizations were accompanied by a dramatic increase in membrane conductance and showed no sign of adaptation to ATP over a period of 30 min. At 5 mM total ATP (ATPt) the whole-cell conductance was approximately 10 nS, and an upper limit of 20 pS for a single-channel conductance has been established. The reversal potential associated with the ATP-induced depolarization at asymmetric K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Cl- concentrations across the membrane was 0 mV. In patch-clamped cells depolarization was complete at 20 microM ATP4-, and repolarization from full depolarization occurred in approximately 5 s. In contrast, in intact cells measured by microelectrode impalement, complete depolarization occurred at approximately 2 mM ATP4- and repolarization was much slower (approximately 100 min). These findings indicate that the changes in intracellular ionic composition that occur after ATP treatment affect the rate of cell repolarization. At lower concentrations of ATP, potassium conductances modulated the depolarizing effect of ATP. ATP also depolarized mouse peritoneal macrophages, but a variant cell line (ATPR B2), derived from J774.2 cells by prolonged exposure to ATP, was insensitive to ATP. Our results provide a membrane electrophysiological description and analysis of a large nonselective plasma membrane conductance of macrophages induced by extracellular ATP.\r"

The bacteriochlorophyll dimer (D), bacteriochlorophyll monomers (B), and bacteriopheophytin monomers (phi) form two branches, A and B, that are approximately related by a twofold symmetry axis. The cofactors are located in hydrophobic environments formed by the L and M subunits. Differences in the cofactor-protein interactions between the A and B cofactors, as well as between the corresponding cofactors of Rb, sphaeroides and Rhodopseudomonas viridis [Michel, H., Epp, O. & Deisenhofer, J. (1986) EMBO J. 3, 2445-2451], are delineated. The roles of several structural features in the preferential electron transfer along the A branch are discussed. Two bound detergent molecules of beta-octyl glucoside have been located near BA and BB. The environment of the carotenoid, C, that is present in RCs from Rb. sphaeroides 2.4.1 consists largely of aromatic residues of the M subunit. A role of BB in the triplet energy transfer from D to C and the reason for the preferential ease of removal of BB from the RC is proposed.\r"

  ".W": "We report the isolation from tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) of an ethylene-responsive member of the proteinase inhibitor gene family. DNA sequence analysis of a full-length cDNA clone indicates that the ethylene-responsive gene is distantly related to the tomato proteinase inhibitor I gene, having 53% sequence identity. The predicted amino acid sequence reveals 47% and 45% sequence identity with the tomato and potato proteinase inhibitor I polypeptides, respectively. Additionally, the ethylene-responsive inhibitor has evolved a completely different pattern of gene expression and inhibitory specificity than other members of the inhibitor I family. Gel blot hybridization experiments show that, unlike the tomato proteinase inhibitor I gene, it is not induced in wounded leaves. In contrast, it is activated by the plant hormone ethylene in leaves and during fruit ripening. Furthermore, the ethylene-responsive inhibitor exhibits a novel reactive site, having glutamic acid as the P1 residue. This suggests that the ethylene-responsive proteinase inhibitor does not react with chymotrypsin, as does proteinase inhibitor I, but that it reacts with proteolytic enzymes that cleave at glutamic residues, such as the Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase, for which no inhibitors are known. Finally, isolation and analysis of a genomic clone reveals that the ethylene-responsive proteinase inhibitor gene is tightly linked to another, yet unidentified, coordinately expressed gene. We discuss these results with regard to the function and evolution of proteinase inhibitor genes in tomato.\r"

Cholesterol appeared also in the Golgi complex of some normal fibroblasts after 24 hr of low density lipoprotein loading. These findings indicate that components of the Golgi complex play a role in the intracellular translocation of exogenously derived cholesterol and that disruptions of the cholesterol transport pathway at the Golgi may, in part, be responsible for the deficiency in cholesterol utilization in type-C Niemann-Pick fibroblasts.\r"

Protein A-coated liposomes bound human B lymphoblastoid cells preincubated with a mouse IgG2a anti-HLA monoclonal antibody but failed to adhere to cells challenged with an irrelevant (anti-H-2) antibody of the same isotype or to cells incubated in the absence of antibody. Transfection of target cells bound to protein A-coated liposomes was achieved by electroporation. This step was essential since only electroporated cells survived in a selective medium containing mycophenolic acid. Transfection efficiency with electroporation and targeted liposomes was as efficient as conventional procedures that used unencapsulated plasmids free in solution but, in the latter case, cell selectivity is not possible. This technique provides a methodology for introducing defined biological macromolecules into specific cell types.\r"

  ".W": "Chinese hamster ovary transfectants that express insulin receptors in which tyrosine residues 1162 and 1163 were replaced by phenylalanine exhibit a total inhibition of the insulin-mediated tyrosine kinase activity toward exogenous substrates [histone, casein, and poly(Glu/Tyr)]; this latter activity is associated with total inhibition of the hypersensitivity reported for insulin in promoting 2-deoxyglucose uptake. We now present evidence that the twin tyrosines also control the insulin-mediated stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Surprisingly, this type of Chinese hamster ovary transfectant is as hypersensitive to insulin for its mitogenic effect as are Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing many intact insulin receptors. Such data suggest that (i) the insulin mitogenic effect routes through a different pathway than insulin uses to activate the transport and metabolism of glucose and (ii) the mitogenic effect of insulin is not controlled by the twin tyrosines. At the molecular level, the solubilized mutated receptor has no insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activity, whereas this receptor displays measurable insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of its beta subunit in 32P-labeled cells. We therefore propose that the autocatalytic phosphorylating activity of the receptor reports a cryptic tyrosine kinase activity that cannot be visualized by the use of classical exogenous substrates.\r"

To examine whether this altered behavior was the consequence of an alteration in bilayer organization induced by PtdSer, a method utilizing the fluorescent dye merocyanine 540 was used to assess the packing of external phospholipids. No significant difference in overall membrane lipid organization was detected between liposomes containing 2 or 3 mol % of PtdSer, at which dramatic differences in recognition and clearance occurred. These results exclude alterations in phospholipid packing as an indirect cause of increased clearance of PtdSer-containing liposomes and implicate PtdSer directly in recognition by the reticuloendothelial system.\r"

Levels of GT mRNA were increased at 1 day after butyrate treatment and continued to increase for at least 4 days; however, acetate and propionate did not affect GT mRNA levels significantly. The induction of GT mRNA by butyrate was accompanied by an increase in GT function. The expression of GT mRNA decreased in HepG2, HT-29, and COS cells by treatment with butyrate for 1 day. Interestingly, glucose deprivation of LLC-PK1 cells reduced the induction of GT mRNA by butyrate, although starvation itself slightly enhanced steady-state GT mRNA levels. Therefore, expression of GT in LLC-PK1 cells is strongly induced by butyrate by a pathway that apparently depends on the presence of glucose in culture medium.\r"

  ".W": "Development of the nervous system in the amphibian embryo is initiated during gastrulation by an inductive interaction between chordamesoderm and dorsal ectoderm. The induced ectoderm forms the neural plate while uninduced ectoderm generates epidermis. We screened for genes activated during gastrulation and expressed specifically in the nervous system of Xenopus laevis in the expectation that clones representing such genes will constitute useful markers for the study of early neurogenesis. Probes were prepared from adult brain RNA by subtraction with RNA from ovary and from different combinations of adult kidney, muscle, and skin; cDNA libraries prepared from early to late neurula embryo RNA were screened with these probes. Six clones were chosen for further study. Three of these clones are not represented in the maternal RNA population but are activated at the late gastrula stage; the other three increase from a maternal base. Expression of five of the genes is restricted to the neural plate during embryogenesis, and all six are restricted to the central nervous system in premetamorphic tadpoles and adults. One of the clones encodes an apparently neurospecific isoform of beta-tubulin; the identity of the other clones is unknown. Expression of all six genes is suppressed in axis-deficient embryos that lack dorsal structures including the brain.\r"

  ".W": "Cell proliferation is a major event during early limb development. Significant levels of growth factor activity, as measured by stimulation of DNA synthesis in mouse BALB/c 3T3 cells, were found in extracts of chicken embryo limb buds at early stages of development. Extracts from stage-18 limbs (3 days of incubation) were 2 to 3 times more potent than were extracts from older stages, namely 22-24 (4 days), 26 (5 days), and 28 (6 days). Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was measured specifically using an RIA, and the amounts of factor obtained corresponded to the activities measured by the 3T3 cell-growth assay. In addition, most growth factor in the extracts bound with high affinity to heparin-Sepharose columns. Western (immunologic) blotting and immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for bFGF revealed a protein of identical size to bFGF--i.e., 18 kDa, in the extracts. Thus, a growth factor with the properties of bFGF is present in the early limb, and the level of this factor is highest when proliferation is a predominant cellular event in the developing limb. These and other data suggest that fibroblast growth factor is a key regulatory factor in embryonic growth and morphogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "In the developing fetal testis, in vitro as well as in vivo, two kinds of endocrine cells differentiate successively: Sertoli cells, which produce the Mullerian inhibitor (or anti-Mullerian hormone) and aggregate with germ cells into seminiferous cords; and Leydig cells, which release androgens. Serum added to the synthetic culture medium prevents the morphogenesis of the seminiferous cords but not the cytodifferentiation of the endocrine cells. L-Azetidine 2-carboxylic acid (LACA), a proline competitor, introduced into the medium also prevents differentiation of seminiferous cords. In the present experiments, the effects of LACA on the endocrine cells were studied. It did not suppress production of the Mullerian inhibitor, but it opposed differentiation of Leydig cells. Histochemically detectable 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) was virtually absent and the release of testosterone, delta 4-androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, or progesterone into the medium became undetectable. Moreover, dibutyryl cAMP added to the medium during the final day in vitro had very little effect on the parameters of steroidogenesis. An excess of proline added to the LACA-containing medium permitted normal morphogenesis of seminiferous cords, normal steroidogenesis, and normal response to cAMP. LACA did not prevent the appearance of 3 beta-HSD activity in the adrenals, nor did it reduce the expression of laminin and fibronectin (data not shown) in the mesonephric structures as much as in the testes. The differentiation of the testis and especially of the Leydig cells appears to have special requirements for proline.\r"

In two separate experiments, experimental infection of swine with various doses of the H2 mutant resulted in the emergence in 11 of 20 animals of virus with the L phenotype. All evidence indicates that the H2----L mutation, selection, and evolution to predominance occurred within the 7-day span of individual infections. L and H2 mutations appear to act as alleles in the adaptation of virus, respectively, to natural and laboratory hosts. Although the gradual evolution of mutants during sequential infections is commonplace, the present recognition of rapid and predictable evolution of mutants of increased replication efficiency and specific phenotype in the natural host, to our knowledge, is unprecedented.\r"

The analysis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification of DNA encoding the first domain of the DQ beta chain and by dot blot analysis of the amplified material with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. One hundred twenty-three randomly selected healthy Caucasian donors were also tested. The results demonstrated that haplotypes carrying an aspartic acid in position 57 (Asp-57) of their DQ beta chain were significantly increased in frequency among nondiabetic haplotypes (23/38), while non-Asp-57 haplotypes were significantly increased in frequency among diabetic haplotypes (65/69). Ninety-six percent of the diabetic probands in our study were homozygous non-Asp/non-Asp as compared to 19.5% of healthy unrelated controls. This conferred a relative risk of 107 (chi 2 = 54.97; P = 0.00003) for non-Asp-57 homozygous individuals. Even though the inheritance and genetic features of IDDM are complex and are not necessarily fully explained by DQ beta chain polymorphism, this approach is much more sensitive than HLA serolog in assessing risk for IDDM.\r"

The spherocytosis and jaundiced loci affect the membrane skeletal protein known as spectrin. The normoblastosis locus affects the spectrin binding protein called ankyrin. We have obtained genetic data that define the linkage relationships among three spectrin genes and the spherocytosis and jaundiced loci. The erythroid alpha-spectrin gene is tightly linked to the spherocytosis locus on chromosome 1 and the jaundiced locus is on chromosome 12, tightly linked to the erythroid beta-spectrin gene. The brain alpha-spectrin (alpha-fodrin) gene is located on the centromeric end of chromosome 2 and is not closely linked to any previously mapped erythroid or neurological mutation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that defects in the alpha- and beta-spectrin genes cause the spherocytosis and jaundiced hemolytic anemias in mice. All five loci studied are located within chromosomal segments that are conserved between mouse and man. Analysis of the data from the chromosome 12 study defines a new order for the genes on that chromosome and delineates the largest mouse/human conserved chromosomal segment yet known.\r"

This construct contains an internal promoter of the human alpha 1-antitrypsin gene driving transcription of the phenylalanine hydroxylase cDNA. Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from newborn mice, infected with the recombinant virus, and selected for expression of the neomycin-resistance gene. Hepatocytes transformed with the recombinant virus contained high levels of human phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA transcripts originating form the retroviral and internal promoters. These results demonstrate that the transcriptional regulatory elements of the alpha 1-antitrypsin gene retain their tissue-specific function in the recombinant provirus and establish a method for efficient transfer and high-level expression of human phenylalanine hydroxylase in primary hepatocytes.\r"

The radiolabeled probes were used to screen for androgen receptor mutations on Southern blots prepared by restriction endonuclease digestion of genomic DNA from human subjects with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). In this investigation, we considered only patients presenting complete AIS and with the androgen receptor (-) form as the most probable subjects to show a gene deletion. One subject from each of six unrelated families with the receptor (-) form of complete AIS and 10 normal subjects (6 females and 4 males) were studied. In the 10 normal subjects and in 5 of the 6 patients, identical DNA restriction fragment patterns were observed with EcoRI and BamHI. In one affected individual, a partial deletion of the androgen receptor gene involving the steroid-binding domain was detected. Analysis of other members of this family confirmed the apparent gene deletion. Our data provide direct proof that complete AIS in some families can result from a deletion of the androgen receptor structural gene. However, other families do not demonstrate such a deletion, suggesting that point mutations (or small, undetectable deletions) may also result in the receptor (-) form of complete AIS, adding further to the genetic heterogeneity of this syndrome.\r"

Thus, V delta and V alpha segments are interspersed along the chromosome. The germ-line organization of the D delta 2, J delta 1, and J delta 2 segments was determined. Linkage of C delta to the J alpha region was established by identification of J alpha segments within 20 kb downstream of C delta. The organization of the locus was also analyzed by field-inversion gel electrophoresis. The unrearranged V delta 1 and D delta, J delta, C delta regions are quite distant from each other, apparently separated by a minimum of 175-180 kb.\r"

Since BS-SHI-4M cells react with sera from various individual cancer patients at relatively low frequencies (2-9%), as detected by an indirect immunofluorescence technique, cell clones that specifically react with sera from patients with OVC and ML were separated by the \"panning\" method in which polystyrene dishes were coated with sera from OVC and ML patients and cells with the corresponding antigens bound to the dishes. Subsequent cloning by limiting dilution provided cell clones highly enriched for OVC- and ML-associated antigens. Karyotype analyses revealed that cell clones with OVC and ML antigens had common marker chromosomes, der(14)t(14;14) (p11;q11),t(6;?)(p25;?) and t(9;?)(q34;?), besides t(17;?) (q25;?) found in the OVC-antigen-positive clones and t(5;?) (p13;?),t(7;?)(q36;?) found in the ML-antigen-positive clones. Interestingly, in cell clones with a strong OVC antigen response, the distal part of the Y chromosome (Yq11) was missing in 100% of the cells. Therefore the cell line BS-SHI-4M appears to be a reservoir of cell clones each of which carries a specific tumor antigen and thus provides a potential tool for rapid serological diagnosis of cancer.\r"

From a carcinoid liver metastasis, human PLI was extracted and purified by HPLC. Two C-terminally amidated peptides were isolated and characterized by sequence analysis. The first peptide, hCgA-210-301, consists of 92 amino acid residues with glycinamide as C terminus. It is identical to the cDNA-derived sequence of human chromogranin A, positions 210-301, which is preceded by two basic residues indicating a putative processing site. The C-terminal part, positions 250-301, shows 70% sequence identity to porcine pancreastatin and represents the human pancreastatin-like sequence. The second peptide, hCgA-273-301, represents a C-terminally amidated fragment of the human pancreastatin sequence, generated by an Asp-Pro cleavage at the N terminus. Peptide hCgA-273-301 was synthesized to confirm the structure of the natural peptide. Two other peptides derived from human chromogranin A were isolated and partially characterized. They are generated by proteolytic cleavage after dibasic amino acids Lys-Arg (positions 338-339) and after Trp-376 of the human chromogranin A sequence, respectively. These results indicate that chromogranin A may represent the precursor for pancreastatin-related and possibly other yet-unidentified peptides of unknown physiological function.\r"

Anti-LKM1 titers follow the severity of the disease and the presence of these antibodies serves as a diagnostic marker for this autoimmune hepatitis type II. We demonstrate that anti-LKM1 IgGs specifically inhibit the hydroxylation of bufuralol in human liver microsomes. Using two assay systems with different selectivity for the two cytochrome P-450 isozymes catalyzing bufuralol metabolism in human liver, we show that anti-LKM1 exclusively recognizes cytochrome P-450db1. Immunopurification of the LKM1 antigen from solubilized human liver microsomes resulted in an electrophoretically homogenous protein that had the same molecular mass (50 kDa) as purified P-450db1 and an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. Recognition of both purified P-450db1 and the immunoisolated protein on western blots by several monoclonal antibodies confirmed the identity of the LKM1 antigen with cytochrome P-450db1. Cytochrome P-450db1 has been identified as the target of a common genetic polymorphism of drug oxidation. However, the relationship between the polymorphic cytochrome P-450db1 and the appearance of anti-LKM1 autoantibodies as well as their role in the pathogenesis of chronic active hepatitis remains speculative.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatitis A virus, an hepatotropic picornavirus, is a common cause of acute hepatitis in man for which there is no available vaccine. Competitive binding studies carried out in solid phase suggest that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to hepatitis A virus recognize a limited number of epitopes on the capsid surface, although the polypeptide locations of these epitopes are not well defined. Neutralization-escape mutants, selected for resistance to monoclonal antibodies, demonstrate broad cross-resistance to other monoclonal antibodies. Sequencing of virion RNA from several of these mutants demonstrated that replacement of aspartic acid residue 70 of capsid protein VP3 (residue 3070) with histidine or alanine confers resistance to neutralization by monoclonal antibody K2-4F2 and prevents binding of this antibody and other antibodies with similar solid-phase competition profiles. These results indicate that residue 3070 contributes to an immunodominant antigenic site. Mutation at residue 102 of VP1 (residue 1102) confers partial resistance against antibody B5-B3 and several other antibodies but does not prevent antibody attachment. Both VP3 and VP1 sites align closely in the linear peptide sequences with sites of neutralization-escape mutations in poliovirus and human rhinovirus, suggesting conservation of structure among these diverse picornaviruses. However, because partial neutralization resistance to several monoclonal antibodies (2D2, 3E1, and B5-B3) was associated with mutation at either residue 3070 or residue 1102, these sites appear more closely related functionally in hepatitis A virus than in these other picornaviruses.\r"

Therefore, we have investigated the effects of hepatitis B virus gene products on expression of the human immunodeficiency virus I in transient transfection studies of Jurkat lymphoblastic T cells, using as reporter the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene coupled to the long terminal repeat of human immunodeficiency virus I. As measured by the amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity, gene expression directed by the human immunodeficiency virus I long terminal repeat increased approximately 10-fold in response to the hepatitis B virus X protein. This trans-activation by the X protein is multiplicative with the effect of phorbol esters and can be accounted for by an increase in the steady-state level of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA. Analysis of deletion and clustered point mutants in the long terminal repeat indicated that the X protein exerts its effect through multiple cis-acting sites. These results provide a possible molecular basis for the association of hepatitis B virus and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and confirm that the X protein is a transcriptional transactivator.\r"

  ".W": "Purines are ubiquitous endogenous cellular metabolites that have been postulated as neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in the nervous system. Recently, we showed that a low-molecular-mass component present in liver-conditioned medium selectively enhances the adrenergic properties of dissociated chicken sympathetic neurons in culture. We report here that this substance is inosine, a purine metabolite. Indeed, analysis of the low-molecular-mass fraction of liver-conditioned medium by HPLC shows that the neurotrophic activity coelutes with and has the same absorption spectrum as inosine. Inosine increases incorporation of [3H]leucine into neuronal protein and stimulates catecholamine, but not acetylcholine, production by the sympathetic neurons in a dose-dependent fashion (half-maximal stimulation at 10(-6) M). This effect can be blocked by 5 x 10(-6) M dipyridamole, an inhibitor of nucleoside transport. Inosine therefore appears to be capable of modulating adrenergic phenotypic expression in cultured sympathetic neurons by acting via an as-yet-unknown intracellular pathway.\r"

Afferents from the ipsilateral and contralateral magnocellular cochlear nuclei enter the nucleus laminaris through its dorsal and ventral surfaces, respectively, and interdigitate in the nucleus. Intracellular recordings from these afferents show orderly changes in conduction delay with depth in the nucleus. These changes are comparable to the range of interaural time differences available to the owl. Thus, these afferent axons act as delay lines and provide anatomical and physiological bases for a neuronal map of interaural time differences in the nucleus laminaris.\r"

CCK-8 released by depolarization of slices of rat cerebral cortex, as measured by its immunoreactivity (CCK-ir), undergoes extensive degradation (approximately 85% of the amount released) before reaching the incubation medium. However, recovery of CCK-ir is enhanced up to 3-fold in the presence of serine-alkylating reagents (i.e., phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) as well as selected active site-directed inactivators (i.e., peptide chloromethyl ketones) or transition-state inhibitors (i.e., peptide boronic acids) of serine peptidases. Among these compounds, elastase inhibitors were the most potent protecting agents, whereas trypsin or chymotrypsin inhibitors were ineffective. HPLC analysis of endogenous CCK-ir recovered in media of depolarized slices indicated that endogenous CCK-5 [CCK-(29-33)-pentapeptide] was the most abundant fragment and that its formation was strongly decreased in the presence of an elastase inhibitor. HPLC analysis of fragments formed upon incubation of exogenous CCK-8 [CCK-(26-33)-octapeptide] with brain slices showed CCK-5, Gly-Trp-Met, and Trp-Met to be major metabolites of CCK-8 whose formation was prevented or at least diminished in the presence of the elastase inhibitor. It is concluded that there is an elastase-like serine endopeptidase in brain that cleaves the two peptide bonds of CCK-8 where the carboxyl group is donated by a methionine residue and constitutes a major inactivation ectoenzyme for the neuropeptide.\r"

Such research has been directed towards problems in developmental neurobiology and in animal models of neurological diseases. Whether intracerebrally transplanted human fetal neurons are capable of forming synapses and releasing neurotransmitters are key questions in any application of this approach to human brain development and dysfunction. We studied these questions by examining the immunocytochemical and in vivo electrochemical properties of xenografts of human mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons placed into athymic \"nude\" rats. The transplanted neurons survive, continue to express human-specific Thy-1 immunoreactivity, and extend neuronal processes into the host brain where morphologically identifiable synapses form. Potassium-evoked release of monoamines occurs in the vicinity of the graft but is absent in more remote areas of the host neuropil. These results indicate that human fetal tissue fragments can provide a source of viable neuroblasts for transplantation. Further, synapses form between pre- and postsynaptic elements expressing different species-specific cell surface markers; thus, these markers do not play a determining role in synaptogenesis.\r"

Both LxA4 and LxB4 slowly contracted pulmonary parenchymal strips isolated from guinea pigs, rabbits, and rats in a concentration-dependent manner over the range 0.1-1 microM. This bronchoconstrictor effect was not associated with release of peptide leukotrienes or thromboxane A2, nor was it blocked by lipoxygenase inhibitors or thromboxane receptor antagonists, suggesting it is a direct effect of lipoxins. However, the leukotriene D4 (LTD4) receptor antagonist LY-171883 reduced the LxA4 response, indicating that LTD4 and LxA4 may share the same receptor. LxA4 and LxB4 also exerted an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in guinea pig, rat, and, to a lesser extent, rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle. In contrast to other vasoactive icosanoids, LxA4 and LxB4 failed to aggregate rat, rabbit, or guinea pig platelets or to inhibit ADP-induced aggregation. LxA4 also enhanced the release of liver lysosomal hydrolases in a liver large granule fraction, indicating a lysosomal labilizing action of LxA4. LxA4 and LxB4 share a similar biological profile. It is not clear yet whether the lipoxins could be mediators of circulatory or pulmonary disease states.\r"

  ".W": "Hatchlings of the painted turtle (Chrysemys picta marginata) are unique as the only reptile and highest vertebrate life form known to tolerate the natural freezing of extracellular body fluids during winter hibernation. Turtles survived frequent exposures to temperatures as low as -6 degrees C to -8 degrees C in their shallow terrestrial nests over the 1987-1988 winter. Hatchlings collected in April 1988 had a mean supercooling point of -3.28 +/- 0.24 degrees C and survived 24 hr of freezing at -4 degrees C with 53.4% +/- 1.98% of total body water as ice. Recovery appeared complete after 20 hr of thawing at 3 degrees C. However, freezing at -10.9 degrees C, resulting in 67% ice, was lethal. A survey of possible cryoprotectants revealed a 2- to 3-fold increase in glucose content of liver and blood and a 3-fold increase in blood glycerol in response to freezing. Although quantitatively low, these responses by spring turtles strongly indicate that these may be the winter-active cryoprotectants. The total amino acid pool of blood also increased 2.25-fold in freezing-exposed turtles, and taurine accounted for 52% of the increase. Most organs accumulated high concentrations of lactate during freezing, a response to the ischemic state imposed by extracellular freezing. Changes in glycogen phosphorylase activity and levels of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were also consistent with a dependence on anaerobic glycolysis during freezing. Studies of the molecular mechanisms of natural freeze tolerance in these turtles may identify protective strategies that can be used in mammalian organ cryopreservation technology.\r"

In contrast, expression of precore plus core sequences leads mainly to the secretion of a heterogeneous population of proteins ranging in size from 15 to 22 kDa that collectively display viral e antigen (HBeAg) activity. We demonstrate that the precore region contains a cleavable 19 amino acid signal peptide that targets the precore proteins to the secretory pathway. The initial product of translocation (P22) is further processed during migration through the secretory pathway, apparently by a series of cleavage events at the arginine-rich carboxyl terminus, to yield multiple proteins of 15-18 kDa (P15-P18) that are secreted along with some P22. Our results indicate that serum HBeAg is generated by a signal peptide-mediated secretion event dependent on precore sequences.\r"

Although metabolic activation has been associated with an alkaline pHi shift in other organisms, in vivo 31P NMR analysis of recovering dauer larvae shows a pHi decrease from approximately 7.3 to approximately 6.3 within 3 hr after the animals encounter food. This shift occurs before feeding begins, and it coincides with, or soon follows, the developmental commitment to recover from the dauer stage, suggesting that control of pHi may be important in the regulation of larval development in nematodes.\r"

After photolysis at low temperatures the CO is in the heme pocket, and the resulting CO stretch bands represent the B substates. Photoselection experiments determine the orientation of CO in the A (bound) and B (photolyzed) substates: Small fractions of MbCO are photolyzed at 10 K with linearly polarized light at 540 nm. The resulting linear dichroism in the A and B IR bands yields the tilt angle between the heme normal and CO. The average angles are as follows: alpha (A0) = 15 degrees +/- 3 degrees; alpha (A1) = 28 degrees +/- 2 degrees, and alpha (A3) = 33 degrees +/- 4 degrees. The A bands are inhomogeneously broadened; the angle alpha shows a wavenumber dependence within the A bands. The wavenumber dependence is interpreted as a distribution of the tilt angle within the individually inhomogeneous A substates, thus providing a structural parameter to characterize the distribution of the conformational substates. The B substates exhibit no induced linear dichroism; in the photolyzed substates the ligand is randomly oriented with respect to the heme plane. The present results together with earlier data on static and kinetic properties of CO binding to Mb establish relations among spectroscopic, structural, energetic, and functional parameters.\r"

  ".W": "Low-temperature flash photolysis with IR and visible spectroscopy was used to probe the influence of the distal histidine His-64(E7) of sperm-whale myoglobin (Mb) on the orientation of bound carbon monoxide (CO) and on the kinetics of CO rebinding. The synthesis and high-level expression of a sperm-whale myoglobin gene in Escherichia coli permits the efficient substitution of the distal histidine through site-directed mutagenesis. Substitution of His-E7 with glycine [GlyE7]Mb bound with CO (CO[GlyE7]Mb) results in one broad bound-CO IR stretch band, v(C-O), centered at 1973 cm-1 at 10 K, in contrast to three distinct bands for native and synthetic wild-type MbCO at 1966, 1945, and 1929 cm-1. After flash photolysis at 10 K, the unbound state of CO[GlyE7]Mb exhibits two CO stretch bands, whereas MbCO has three. Fourier transform IR spectroscopy measurements of the linear dichroism after photoselective flash photolysis of CO bound to [GlyE7]Mb at 10 K reveals the bound CO to be oriented at an angle of alpha = 20 degrees +/- 2 degrees with respect to the heme normal. Flash photolysis data from 10 to 300 K provide evidence for a larger distal pocket and a smaller enthalpy barrier (by approximately 4 kJ/mol) for [GlyE7]MbCO as compared with wild-type MbCO. These results reinforce the notion that the dominant control of the binding step at the heme iron comes from the proximal side through the protein structure.\r"

We have generated a Chinese hamster ovary line resistant to bifunctional nitrogen mustards and in this report have characterized and isolated the protein that represents the major observable phenotypic difference between the drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines. This purified protein is shown to be an alpha class glutathione S-transferase comprising YcYc subunits and possessing a pI value of approximately 8.0. The intracellular level of the Yc subunit is elevated greater than 40-fold in the drug-resistant cell line, which could account for the increase in glutathione S-transferase (RX:glutathione R-transferase; EC 2.5.1.18) activity toward both 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and cumene hydroperoxide. Other glutathione S-transferase subunits within this gene family are also elevated. These changes are accompanied by a significant elevation in alpha class mRNA levels. Southern analysis indicates that the genes coding for these proteins are amplified 4- to 8-fold in the drug-resistant cell line. In addition, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase [(5-glutamyl)-peptide:amino acid 5-glutamyltransferase; EC 2.3.2.2] activity is increased 3.6-fold in the drug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which may explain the increase in cellular glutathione level. In this case no gene amplification was seen. These data indicate that gene amplification may be important in drug resistance toward alkylating agents and also that other enzymes in glutathione homeostasis are involved.\r"

These two complexes, designated B2 and B3, are distinguished by differential migration in gel retardation assays. The factor that forms the B3 complex, termed IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF-3), preexists in cells, is activated upon IFN treatment, and appears with kinetics paralleling those for transcriptional activation of IFN-stimulated genes. The factor that forms the B2 complex (ISGF-2) appears following a time lag after IFN treatment during which protein synthesis must occur. By extensive point mutagenesis of the ISREs from two IFN-stimulated promoters (ISG54 and ISG15), we demonstrate that the B2 and B3 complexes are formed by factors binding to the same DNA sequence. Mutations at this site decrease or eliminate transcriptional activation and impair binding of both ISGF-2 and ISGF-3. This analysis has shown that the ISGF-3 binding site is slightly broader than the ISGF-2 binding site, which is completely contained within the sequence necessary both for ISGF-3 binding and for transcriptional activation. The evidence strongly implicates ISGF-3 as the positive transcriptional regulator of IFN-stimulated genes.\r"

Butyric acid, which is found in increased plasma concentrations in infants of diabetic mothers who have delayed globin gene switching, was infused into catheterized fetal lambs in utero during the time of the normal globin gene switch period. The globin gene switch was significantly delayed in three of four butyrate-treated fetuses compared with controls and was entirely prevented in one fetus in whom the infusion was begun before the globin switch was under way. These data provide a model for investigating and arresting the biologic clock of hemoglobin switching.\r"

  ".W": "Many human tumors, particularly those of epithelial origin, appear to express greatly reduced levels of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens on their surface. It has been previously reported that the class I gene H-2Ld, introduced into adenovirus type 12-transformed mouse cells, induces reversal of oncogenesis in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. We have tested the hypothesis that the H-2Ld gene, when transfected into HCT colon cancer cells, may alter their transformed phenotype. Two H-2Ld transfectants, HCT-Ii and HCT-If, were found to exhibit a markedly reduced-to-virtually suppressed ability to form colonies in soft agar in comparison to a transfectant (HCTh) carrying only the neomycin-resistance gene. We also compared the tumorigenicity of HCTh vs. HCT-If cells in two different strains of immunodeficient mice: nude (T-) and triple-deficient mutants (T-, NK-, B-). At 28 days postinjection of 10(7) and 10(6) cells, the size and growth rate of HCT-If tumors were greatly reduced compared to HCTh cells. Therefore, as assayed in immunodeficient animals, expression of the class I H-2Ld gene in HCT cells appears to correlate with partial suppression of the tumorigenic phenotype, suggesting that the expression of a transfected class I gene may by itself alter the phenotype of the recipient cell and that such phenotypic changes may be independent of the immune system.\r"

In this patient's leukemic cells, the breakpoint of the t(14;18) translocation occurred in the major breakpoint-cluster region of the BCL2 gene and became linked to the JH4 joining-region gene segment of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on the 14q+ chromosome as previously observed in follicular lymphoma. An N region and heptamer and nonamer signal sequences indicated that this translocation occurred as a mistake in VH-DH-JH joining (where VH and DH are the variable and diversity segments). In the t(8;14) translocation, the breakpoint was located immediately 5' of the first exon of the MYC protooncogene, which was juxtaposed with the C gamma 2 constant gene segment of the second 14q+ chromosome. The finding of repeated sequences typical of switch regions suggested that this translocation occurred during heavy-chain isotype switching, resulting in progression to pre-B-cell leukemia with both the t(8;14) and the t(14;18) translocations. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-positive phenotype of the patient's leukemic cells further suggests that the pre-B-cell leukemia was derived from a pre-B cell carrying a t(14;18) translocation in the original follicular lymphoma. The polymerase chain reaction method was then used to identify cancer cells in the bone marrow of the patient.\r"

Moreover, most of the rat male-specific major translation products differ in size from those translated from male mouse SMG mRNAs. To characterize proteins accumulated in the rat SMG under androgen control, a cDNA library was constructed. Here we report the nucleotide sequence of a 0.7-kilobase mRNA that is 1000-3000 times more abundant in male rats than in female rats. The predicted corresponding protein, SMR1, has a molecular weight of 16,000 and contains a signal peptide for secretion and potential signals for glycosylation. An interesting feature of SMR1 is the presence, in a hydrophilic region, of the tetrapeptide Gln-His-Asn-Pro surrounded by two pairs of basic residues that represent potential cleavage sites for maturation enzymes. In rats, the tissue distribution of the SMR1 mRNA is restricted to the SMG and the prostate. Only very low amounts of SMR1 mRNA can be detected in the SMG of male or female mice. Southern blot analysis indicates the presence of three genes in rats but only one in mice. Hypotheses on the physiological role of SMR1-derived peptides in male rats are discussed.\r"

We have examined the effect of the overdrive sequence on the early steps in T-DNA processing. We report here that overdrive greatly enhances cleavage by the site-specific endonuclease in Agrobacterium, perhaps by directing the endonuclease to the adjacent border sequences. We also show by a gel mobility-shift assay that overdrive affinity-purified proteins from acetosyringone-induced Agrobacterium cells interact with T-DNA border and overdrive sequences. Further, we show that in vivo the virC operon enhances cleavage at the T-DNA borders, most likely by interaction between the VirC1 protein and the overdrive sequence.\r"

Increased transformation frequencies were observed for plasmids that contained either the 2-kb fragment in dimeric or monomeric form or an internal 1.1-kb fragment of TBS. Analysis of transformants revealed that preferentially one copy of foreign DNA is integrated.

To clarify the mechanism of mutation of chloroplast genome structure in higher plants, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the hot-spot region of chloroplast DNAs related to length mutations (deletions/insertions) in Triticum (wheat) and Aegilops. From a comparison of this region in wheat with the corresponding region of tobacco or liverwort, it is evident that one of the open reading frames in tobacco (ORF512) has been replaced in wheat by the rpl23 gene, which is a member of the ribosomal protein gene operon. In the deleted positions and in the original genome of Triticum and Aegilops, consensus sequences forming short direct repeats were found, indicating that these deletions were a result of intramolecular recombination mediated by these short direct-repeat sequences. By two independent recombination events in the Aegilops crassa type of chloroplast genome, which is shared by Triticum monococcum, Ae. bicornis, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. comosa, and Ae. mutica, the novel chloroplast DNA sequences of T. aestivum and Ae. squarrosa were generated.

Six of the Hprt- cell lines showed homologous recombination.

The frequency of nucleotide addition varies among pre-B-cell lines in a manner proportional to their content of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. We also find frequent nucleotide additions (and deletions) at coding joints, but in this case there is no strong correlation with the level of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase activity.

  ".W": "Rat liver nuclei pure by enzymatic and electron microscope criteria contain protein kinase C (PKC) that can be activated several hundredfold within 3 min of addition of prolactin or phorbol 12-tetradecanoate 13-acetate. Rat prolactin stimulated PKC maximally at 10(-12) M, whereas ovine prolactin was maximally stimulatory at 10(-10) M. Activation was time and dose dependent, exhibited a biphasic pattern, and was blocked by anti-prolactin antiserum, by PKC inhibitors such as 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7) and sphingosine, and by cyclosporine. Moreover, the ability of prolactin to activate nuclear PKC was inhibited totally by a monoclonal antibody to the rat liver prolactin receptor, implicating a prolactin receptor-mediated activation process. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a liver mitogen, caused a lesser but significant activation of nuclear PKC. However, EGF and suboptimal prolactin were synergistic. Human growth hormone, which has lactogenic properties, stimulated PKC activity, whereas nonlactogenic substances such as ovine growth hormone, insulin, dexamethasone, and 8-bromo-cAMP were inactive. That this may be a general mechanism for prolactin is suggested by the ability of prolactin to stimulate PKC 140-fold in rat splenocyte nuclei. Prolactin has comitogenic properties in lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies in the serum. It is possible that the PBC-specific immunoreactive trypsin-sensitive antigens on the inner mitochondrial membrane, termed M2, are important in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune disease. We have previously shown that a major M2\"a\" antigen is the E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex located within mitochondria. Analysis of the primary structure of the E2 components of all three 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes reveals a high degree of homology with a similar highly segmented structure including lipoyl domains, E3-binding domains, C-terminal catalytic domains, and interdomain linker sequences. Immunoblotting of PBC patients' sera against purified E2 protein from 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex reveals that these polypeptides are also autoantigens in this disease. Sera from 29 of 40 (72.5%) PBC patients gave a positive response against bovine 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex E2 and from 25 of 40 (62.5%) PBC patients gave a positive response against bovine branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex E2. All 40 PBC patients (100%) have autoantibodies directed against at least one of the E2 components of the family of 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes. Identification of these M2 mitochondrial autoantigens and detailed knowledge of their structure will allow important questions concerning this autoimmune disease to be addressed.\r"

The tumors contained various types of structure, which evolve from intraductal nodes to duct-like structures and then to invasive strands or cells. Most primary tumors were not invasive but became so in subsequent transfers. The distribution of invasive and noninvasive tumors in the various lineages was not random, implying that the tumors differed from their inception in the propensity toward invasion. In different lineages invasive structures appeared repeatedly and independently but with different frequencies, suggesting that they were produced by a stochastic mechanism with different probability of occurrence. The possible nature of this mechanism is discussed. This experimental system is useful for further studies of tumor invasion; the results obtained are relevant for understanding and evaluating the evolution of human breast cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The fibrinogen receptor on human platelets is a prototypic member of the integrin family and is composed of subunit glycoproteins IIb (gpIIb) and IIIa (gpIIIa) in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio. We have isolated cDNA clones for gpIIb and gpIIIa and localized both genes to chromosome 17. In the current study, several approaches were used to localize and map the genes for gpIIb and gpIIIa. A preliminary evaluation of subchromosomal localization was performed by using a panel of mouse-human somatic cell hybrids that contain different amounts of the long arm of human chromosome 17. Southern hybridization to the DNA of these hybrids shows that both genes map near the thymidine kinase gene. In situ hybridization to intact human chromosomes localized both genes to the 17q21-22 region. To better define the physical distance between the two genes, we examined the genomic hybridization pattern of each cDNA probe to high molecular weight restriction fragments separated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Serial hybridizations of the same filter have allowed construction of long-range Mlu I and Sfi I restriction maps spanning more than 500 kilobases. Finally, nonoverlapping portions of the cDNAs for both gpIIb and gpIIIa were used to probe Sfi I digests of genomic DNA separated by field-inversion gels. This confirmed that the genes are physically linked within the same 260-kilobase Sfi I fragment and suggests that the gene for gpIIb is located on the 3' side of the gene for gpIIIa. These results suggest that coordinate expression of gpIIb and gpIIIa may depend on physical proximity.\r"

These studies show that the envelope glycoprotein forms an oligomer during biosynthesis, which is most likely a trimer, and that this is the form of the complex found in virions. Our results are consistent with oligomer formation and transport out of the endoplasmic reticulum being closely linked. From analyses of mutant envelope proteins we conclude that the extracellular domain of the glycoprotein is sufficient for oligomer formation but that the transmembrane domain is required to stabilize this complex. Additional experiments suggest that interactions between external domains of the membrane-spanning, gp37 polypeptides are those most important for the formation of trimers. The significance of these observations to retroviral replication and implications for antiviral drug development are discussed.\r"

The synthetic M2 delta channel peptide exhibits features that are characteristic of the authentic AcChoR channel, such as single channel conductances, discrimination of cations over anions, and channel lifetimes for open and closed states in the millisecond time range.

Responses evoked by single presynaptic neurons were paired with those due to activation of a limited pool of similar inhibitory cells. In about 50% of the experiments the compound currents were substantially larger than the sum of their individual components. Potentiation was maximal when the two responses occurred nearly simultaneously, and its decay paralleled that of the conditioning current; it started with a delay of about 300 microsec, and calculations indicate that in this time transmitter molecules would diffuse laterally 0.5-1.1 micron, which equals the separation of adjacent synapses. Iontophoretically applied glycine produced a comparable enhancement of the eighth nerve evoked inhibitory current. When quantal inhibitory responses were simulated, taking into consideration glycine diffusion, transmitter-receptor interactions, and channel activation, with the latter requiring two binding steps, the results demonstrated that the facilitation when neighboring inputs are active is due to lateral diffusion of the transmitter, glycine, to fringe areas where single bound receptors are available for further interactions and channel opening.\r"

The RNAs for the separate subunits were transcribed in vitro from cDNAs inserted in pSP64T vectors and microinjected in Xenopus oocytes. Microinjected in vitro-transcribed RNAs were stable, with a half-life of 72 hr. Xenopus oocytes assembled functional AcChoRs from the subunit-specific RNAs. These receptors were inserted in the cell membrane and could be detected as early as 6 hr after RNA microinjection. The oocyte-expressed AcChoR subunits could be immunoprecipitated with anti-Torpedo AcChoR subunit antibodies. Expression of the AcChoR in oocytes proceeded linearly for 72 hr after microinjection. While the amount of RNA injected did not alter the linearity of the expression time course, the rate of receptor expression in oocytes showed a saturable dependence on RNA concentration. Varying the relative amount of alpha-subunit RNA microinjected into oocytes had a striking effect on receptor expression. This effect was specific for the alpha-subunit. These results suggest that transcript availability may control receptor expression in Xenopus oocytes. In addition, the availability of the alpha-subunit may be a limiting factor for receptor expression.\r"

The time of birth of HVc neurons projecting to these two regions was determined by combining [3H]thymidine autoradiography and retrograde fluorogold uptake. Birds were sacrificed at 13 months of age, 4 days after fluorogold injections into area X or RA. A single injection of [3H]thymidine in ovo (embryonic day 9) labeled 76% of area X-projecting cells and 0.8% of cells projecting to RA. The great majority of RA-projecting cells were produced during posthatching development (posthatching day 10-240; P10-P240), with a peak at P60 and a hiatus at P120. HVc reaches full adult size by P240, yet at that age the production of new RA-projecting cells continued at a rate comparable to that recorded during posthatching development. Late production of neurons interconnecting two distant regions of the brain may regulate source to target cell population size. Male canaries start to sing at P40. During subsequent months, they imitate external models and their song becomes more structured and stereotyped. At sexual maturity (P240), song is stable. Three interpretations are offered: (i) neurogenesis of RA-projecting cells is related to learning, and learning continues even after achievement of pattern stability; (ii) neurogenesis of RA-projecting cells is not related to learning; (iii) the production of RA-projecting cells serves different purposes during development and after sexual maturity.\r"

Retinal slices incubated with 2-deoxy[3H]glucose convert this glucose analogue to 2-deoxy[3H]glucose 6-phosphate, but this conversion is made only in the glial cells. Hence, glycolysis occurs only in glial cells. In contrast, the neurons consume O2 and this consumption is sustained by the hydrolysis of glycogen, which is contained in large amounts in the glia. During photostimulation the increased oxidative metabolism of the neurons is sustained by a higher supply of carbohydrates from the glia. This clear case of metabolic interaction between neurons and glial cells supports Golgi's original hypothesis, proposed nearly 100 years ago, about the nutritive function of glial cells in the nervous system.\r"

With a magnetic field strength similar to that of a human brain, the measurement and analysis procedures demonstrated a position accuracy better than 3 mm, for a current dipole 3 cm beneath the surface. Subsequently, measurements of the magnetic field pattern appearing 100 ms after the onset of an auditory tone-burst stimulus were obtained in three human subjects. The location of the current dipole representing intracellular ionic current in active neurons of the brain was determined, with 3-mm accuracy, to be within the cortex forming the floor of the Sylvian fissure of the individual subjects, corresponding closely to the Heschl gyrus as determined from magnetic resonance images. With the sensors placed at appropriate positions, the locations of neuronal sources for different tone frequencies could be obtained without moving the recording instrument. Adaptation of activity in human auditory cortex was shown to reveal long-term features with a paradigm that compared response amplitudes for three tones randomly presented.\r"

Heparinase was immobilized to cross-linked agarose particles. A mathematical model was developed to describe the clearance of heparin by the reactor ex vivo and compared to experimental clearances measured in sheep. The model accounted for enzymatic degradation as well as the binding of heparin and its breakdown products to antithrombin. The device was modeled as a steady-state continuously stirred tank reactor. Molar conservation equations within the agarose particles accounted for simultaneous diffusion and chemical reaction. The model had no adjustable parameters and was able to predict the clearance of heparin within 5-25% for three different animals and 12 different perfusions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of alpha 1-adrenergic agonists on the waveforms of action potentials and voltage-gated ionic currents were examined in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes by the whole-cell patch-clamp recording technique. After \"puffer\" applications of either of two alpha 1 agonists, phenylephrine and methoxamine, action-potential durations were increased. In voltage-clamped cells, phenylephrine (5-20 microM) or methoxamine (5-10 microM) reduced the amplitudes of Ca2+-independent voltage-activated outward K+ currents (Iout); neither the kinetics nor the voltage-dependent properties of Iout were significantly affected. The effects of phenylephrine or methoxamine on Iout were larger and longer-lasting at higher concentrations and after prolonged or repeated exposures; in all experiments, however, Iout recovered completely when puffer applications were discontinued. The suppression of Iout is attributed to the activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as neither beta- nor alpha 2-adrenergic agonists had measurable effects on Iout; in addition, the effect of phenylephrine was attenuated in the presence of the alpha antagonist phentolamine (10 microM), but not in the presence of the beta antagonist propranolol (10 microM). Voltage-gated Ca2+ currents, in contrast, were not altered measurably by phenylephrine or methoxamine and no currents were activated directly by these agents. Suppression of Iout was also observed during puffer applications of either of two protein kinase C activators, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 nM-1 microM) and 1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol (60 microM). We conclude that the activation of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors in adult rat ventricular myocytes leads to action-potential prolongation as a result of the specific suppression of Iout and that this effect may be mediated by activation of protein kinase C.\r"

Furthermore, experiments with 45Ca-prelabeled fetal rat limb bones in culture demonstrated that Cd at 10 nM in the medium, a concentration estimated to be in the plasma of mice exposed to 50 ppm dietary Cd, strikingly increased bone resorption, from 27 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) 45Ca release in cultures with no added cadmium to 68 +/- 6% release in cultures containing cadmium (n = 4). These in vitro results indicate that cadmium may enhance bone mineral loss by a direct action on bone. Results of the in vivo studies are consistent with a significant role of cadmium in the etiology of Itai-Itai disease among postmenopausal women in Japan and may in part explain the increased risk of postmenopausal osteoporosis among women who smoke.\r"

Thirty athletes between 18 and 24 years of age with multiple sprains of one ankle and no reported sprains of the other ankle were tested to compare their ability to detect passive plantar flexion and standing balance in each ankle. Luce's choice theory was used to analyze subjects' responses. Subjects had significantly greater difficulty detecting passive motion in the ankle with sprains as compared with the uninjured ankle. Subjects also performed a one-legged standing balance test on both the injured and uninjured legs. In 20 subjects, either the subject or observer reported balance deficits on the injured side as compared with the uninjured side. The results of this study demonstrate the need for clinicians to evaluate kinesthetic deficits and to design exercise programs to improve kinesthetic awareness and decrease ankle instability in individuals with multiple ankle sprains.\r"

Although the cortisol applied to all dogs was limited to the epidermis, penetration occurred beyond the stratum corneum. The combination of 10% cortisol and ultrasound showed more penetration than 10% cortisol alone (p = .018), suggesting that ultrasound may be useful in the transdermal delivery of cortisol cream. The difference between the penetration of 5% and 10% cortisol when treated with ultrasound was only marginally significant (p = .062).\r"

The subjects had a mean age of 24.8 years (s = 5.5) and reported no previous history of pathological conditions of the right lower extremity. Using a correlational design, high intertester reliability was established for each instrument (universal goniometer, r = .87; fluid-based goniometer, r = .83). The concurrent validity of the fluid-based goniometer was also good for both testers (tester A, r = .83; tester B, r = .82). When the data were subjected to t tests, significant differences were found between the instruments for each tester (p less than .05). The results suggest that similar measurements will be obtained between therapists using the universal and fluid-based goniometers; however, the two instruments cannot be used interchangeably in the clinic.\r"

Twenty able-bodied subjects were seated on a pressure-sensing transducer incorporated into an adjustable chair (ischiobarograph). A video camera on the underside of the transducer detected changes in light levels in direct relation to pressure application. The camera output was processed by a microcomputer system that converted the signal into nine colors, each representing a distinct pressure interval in the range of 0 to more than 500 mm Hg. The microcomputer determined the area of each pressure interval before and after a 10-degree posterior tilt of the seat and lumbar support placement. The results demonstrated high test-retest reliability for each position (r = .95). A significant decrease in the six highest pressure intervals occurred when the lumbar support was used in both the upright and reclined positions (p less than .05). The results of this study have implications for wheelchair-dependent individuals.\r"

Subjects were 25 low-risk infants, 10 born at 34 to 36 weeks gestational age and 15 at term. Spontaneous leg movements were videotaped, and a 10-second segment was digitized to provide kinematic data. Data obtained were compared to evaluate the neurological maturation of preterm infants and to investigate the influence of the extrauterine environment on movement. Results showed that all infants had organized movement as determined by high interjoint correlations, small phase lags, and constrained movement durations. Pause durations and joint angles differed among infants. Infant leg movements are highly organized synergies and are not influenced by extrauterine environmental events. Differences in movements are attributed to dynamic interaction of elements in the motor control system. Additional studies with full-term infants may provide further insight into the constraints and supports of the immediate environment on movement outcome.\r"

The most helpful features in the diagnosis of rounded atelectasis with CT were (a) contiguity to areas of diffuse pleural thickening, (b) a lentiform or wedge-shaped outline, (c) evidence of volume loss in the adjacent lung, and (d) a characteristic \"comet tail\" of vessels and bronchi sweeping into the margins of the mass. Less advanced areas of focal atelectasis had fewer classic features. Intrafissural pleural plaques were readily identified with high-resolution CT. In asbestos-related masses, the demonstration of stability over time is necessary. Careful interpretation of CT and high-resolution CT features and close surveillance can obviate the need for biopsy in the majority of instances.\r"

Complications are unusual, but of the ones that do occur, infection, particularly with Nocardia asteroides, and fibrosis are the most common. Few computed tomographic (CT) studies of this condition have been reported. The CT scans of nine patients with PAP were reviewed. Varying combinations of air-space and interstitial patterns were seen. The CT appearance of air-space disease ranged from ill-defined nodules to patchy consolidation to large regions of confluence. Air-space consolidation was sometimes sharply demarcated from surrounding normal lung tissue, which created a geographic pattern. Despite the predominance of air-space patterns, air bronchograms were not a prominent feature. CT showed the interstitial component of disease and the extent of disease more clearly than did plain radiography. In two cases, CT demonstrated focal pneumonia that was not visible on the radiographs.\r"

The P-31 spectrum of normal breast tissue showed low levels of phosphomonoesters (PMEs), inorganic phosphate, phosphodiesters (PDEs), and ATP. In addition, an intense phosphocreatine (PCr) signal was observed in breast tissue of young women: The relative intensities of the PCr and ATP signals had a mean value of 1.9. The tumor spectrum showed elevated levels of PMEs, Pi, and PDEs, while no PCr was seen (PCr/ATP less than 0.2). In two breast cancers treated with radiation therapy, resulting in a decrease of tumor volume of more than 50%, a similar change in the tumor P-31 spectrum was observed: An intense PCr signal developed (PCr/ATP = 1.1). Control experiments indicated that the appearance of PCr after radiation therapy was the result of a radiation-induced metabolic change in the tumor itself.\r"

Forty-one percent of these malignancies contained microscopic calcifications. Lesions demonstrated at mammography in these 27 cases consisted of a well-defined round mass (n = 1); well-defined lobulated masses (n = 2); indistinct round, oval, or lobulated masses (n = 7); irregular or mixed lesions (n = 7); spiculated masses (n = 9); and architectural distortion (n = 1). Histologic margins of infiltrating and intraductal cancers, created by several types of tumor-fat interfaces and surrounding reactive fibrosis, correlated with these radiographic appearances. Serial specimen radiographic-pathologic correlation can improve our understanding of the appearance of early breast cancer at mammography.\r"

The carcinoma was detected initially with barium enema studies in 82 cases (67%), sigmoidoscopy in 18 (15%), colonoscopy in 12 (10%), digital rectal examination in seven (6%), and computed tomography in three (3%). Thirty (37%) of the 82 cases found initially at barium examination were located in the cecum and ascending colon, which is a considerably higher proportion than that reported in studies based on cancer registry data or in surgical series. Thirty-eight (95%) of the 40 carcinomas first detected with other techniques were located distal to the hepatic flexure; 18 of those were identified initially with sigmoidoscopy. Because many distal carcinomas were first detected with nonradiologic techniques, an unusually high percentage of carcinomas in the cecum and ascending colon were found initially with barium enema studies. These findings suggest that barium enema evaluation of the right side of the colon needs to be at least as detailed as that of the rectum and sigmoid colon, areas that are increasingly assessed with sigmoidoscopy before barium enema studies are performed.\r"

Sixty-five percent of PAVMs were located in the lower lobes, which correlated with the finding of more pronounced hypoxemia in the upright position. After embolotherapy, symptomatic hypoxemia was corrected, and serial values have remained constant for 5 years. Complications were minimal, and no patient required surgery. Balloon embolotherapy is effective long-term therapy for PAVMs, and family screening should be pursued because of the possibility of a higher frequency of paradoxical embolization (stroke) than previously recognized.\r"

Surgery is usually used to obliterate these vessels but may be difficult, involve prolonged operative time, or require a different thoracotomy than that used for correction or palliation of the cardiac anomaly. Sixteen trans-catheter embolization procedures were performed in 15 patients with systemic-to-pulmonary collateral vessels and shunts. In eight embolization procedures performed because of congestive heart failure or low oxygenation, clinical improvement was obtained in seven. In all six patients who underwent embolization preoperatively, the outcome of surgical correction or palliation was satisfactory. Hemorrhage ceased in the two patients with hemoptysis. There were two complications, one transient loss of femoral pulse and one segmental pulmonary infarction. Embolization is a useful adjunct to surgery and medical management of patients with systemic-to-pulmonary collateral vessels and shunts.\r"

The atherectomy catheter is inserted through a sheath, and the resection window of the catheter is positioned adjacent to the vascular stenosis. The balloon is inflated, and the motor-driven cutting blade advanced. The balloon is then deflated, the catheter withdrawn, and the atheromatous material, which resembles the resected material of an endarterectomy, removed from the catheter. This process is repeated until the resection provides an adequate lumen. To date, 12 arterial lesions (three common iliac, two external iliac, four superficial femoral, and three popliteal artery) in ten patients have been resected with excellent angiographic results. The conditions of seven patients who underwent atherectomy for relief from claudication were improved by the criteria of ankle/arm ratios and/or claudication distance. Three patients successfully underwent atherectomy for limb salvage. More data on long-term patency and restenosis rates are needed before the ultimate role of atherectomy in the management of peripheral artery disease can be determined.\r"

Extension to perivesical fat was present in 18 of 40 patients and was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 100%. Invasion of the adjacent organs was present in nine of 40 patients and was diagnosed with a sensitivity of 44% and a specificity of 96%. On the basis of the MR findings, the tumor was correctly staged, according to the TNM classification, in 24 of 40 (60%) patients, tumor extension was overestimated in three of 40 (7.5%) patients, and tumor extension was underestimated in 13 of 40 (32.5%) patients. MR imaging has been shown to be accurate in identification of macroscopic lymph node involvement and deep muscle involvement. It appears to be at least as useful as computed tomography (CT) in the evaluation of perivesical fat involvement and to be superior to CT in the detection of invasion of adjacent organs. One limitation of MR imaging is in the evaluation of tumor extension into the periurethral glands.\r"

The information obtained with both modalities was correlated with surgical data. The results indicate that the accuracy of MR imaging in helping to differentiate benign from malignant lesions is high and identical to that of CT, but not good enough to obviate surgical diagnosis. While all five hepatocellular carcinomas were correctly diagnosed preoperatively with both modalities, neither CT nor MR imaging could help differentiate these carcinomas from aggressive hepatoblastoma or primary hepatic lymphoma. MR imaging helped correctly predict tumor resectability in all 18 children with malignant hepatic tumors; in one, exact tumor extension was misjudged with CT. Postoperative MR studies suggested tumor recurrence in three children who had unremarkable CT examinations. Second-look surgery showed recurrent tumor in two and fibrosis with chronic inflammation at the surgical margin in the third child.\r"

Rotational disk displacement implies a combination of anterior and medial or lateral displacements, whereas sideways displacement implies pure medial or lateral displacement without an anterior component. Multiple 3-mm-thick coronal and sagittal MR images were obtained of 18 fresh TMJ autopsy specimens and compared with the observations in corresponding coronal cryosections. MR imaging correctly delineated the mediolateral position of the disk in 15 joints (83%) and incorrectly delineated it in three joints (17%). Osseous anatomy was correctly assessed in 17 joints (94%). On cryosections, six joints (33%) showed medial disk displacement and two joints (11%) showed lateral displacement. In five of these eight joints the medial or lateral displacement occurred in conjunction with an anterior displacement, that is, rotational displacement. Clinical MR imaging in 37 patients (61 joints with coronal images) showed medial or lateral disk displacement in 16 joints (26%). This study suggests that rotational and sideways displacements of the TMJ disk are an important aspect of internal derangement. The multiplanar capabilities of MR are suitable for an assessment of these abnormalities.\r"

Intravenously administered gadolinium DTPA produces enhancement of all foraminal soft tissues, including the dorsal root ganglion. The nerve roots do not enhance with Gd-DTPA.

The largest disk-bulging indexes were always associated with radial tears of the anulus. Eighty-four percent of the disks with radial tears had disk-bulging indexes greater than 2.5 mm. Most normal adult disks had an index of less than 2.5 mm. The results challenge the concept that the anulus fibrosus is intact in bulging disks, although ruptured in herniated disks.\r"

Cord motion was found to be significantly decreased in cases in which the cord was either tethered or compressed.

While normal brain tissues showed only small interindividual variations of tissue parameters, pathologic entities (tumor, edema) were characterized by wide ranges of T1, T2, and proton density values. The considerable overlapping of tissue parameters in different tumor entities, which were analyzed in a three-dimensional T1/T2/proton density space, indicates that a reliable diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of a quantitative evaluation of T1, T2, and proton density alone.\r"

This system is based on 2-hydroxy-ethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as the monomer, in combination with a cross-linking agent and a water-soluble curing system. The low-viscosity, hydrophilic mixture can be exchanged through a small-bore catheter into a detachable balloon and polymerizes in 40-60 minutes at body temperature. Partially polymerized HEMA can cause vascular occlusion; hence, careful timing of balloon detachment is required. The evolution of the radiographic appearance of HEMA-filled balloons is predictable. The balloons remain radiopaque on plain radiographs as long as the balloon shell and valve mechanisms are competent. After rupture of the shell or failure of the valve mechanism, the balloons become invisible on plain radiographs but remain hyperattenuating on computed tomography scans.\r"

The other two patients with abnormal sonographic results had collections of fluid that were separated from the bone by a variable amount of soft tissue. These collections were confined to the soft tissue and did not appear to arise from the bone. Aspiration revealed a soft-tissue abscess in one patient and a seroma in the second.

Ten patients who had histologically proved leukemia or aplastic anemia were then examined. The data show that changes in fat fraction represent the underlying reason for many of the changes observed in conventional spin-echo (SE) images of these disorders. Although both conventional and chemical shift images showed differences among the pathologic groups and healthy volunteers, fat fraction determined with chemical shift imaging was the single best discriminator among them. A two-point estimate of fat fraction was also evaluated. This rapid imaging protocol performed almost as well as the complete quantitative analysis in discriminating between pathologic and healthy tissue and showed improved discrimination compared with conventional SE techniques.\r"

The magnet has a warm bore that measures 1.25 m in diameter, and its homogeneity in a sphere with a diameter of 50 cm is better than +/- 2.5 ppm. It was hypothesized that the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) afforded by the higher field strength would be useful in reducing imaging time and in improving spatial resolution. In experiments in human volunteers, believed to be the first in which an entire human body was exposed to a magnetic flux density of that magnitude, the subjects were exposed to 4 T for 10-30 minutes. They showed no changes in well-being or heart activity. The expected gain in spectral resolution due to chemical-shift scaling was achieved with the 4-T system, and an improvement in S/N was verified for phosphorus at 34 and 68 MHz. In sodium imaging, the high flux density appears to be useful in reducing imaging time, which should increase the usefulness of sodium imaging in evaluating brain tumors and strokes. In spectroscopy, the increase in flux density improves the quality of the spectra.\r"

Twenty-six hospitals with a CT scanner were compared with 27 hospitals without on the basis of number of radiologic procedures per clinical patient from 1977 to 1984. Changes in average length of hospitalization were also considered. The number of procedures decreased in hospitals with CT scanners (-9%), in contrast to hospitals without (+10%). The influence of CT on average length of stay appeared minimal. Although this study was limited, the authors believe that use of CT influenced changes in radiologic utilization.\r"

  ".W": "The goal of sophisticated treatment planning in radiation therapy is to maximize dose to the tumor or target volume, while the integral dose is minimized, to reduce normal tissue morbidity. In the head and neck regions, the anatomic irregularities of individual patients and the critical structures that limit the administration of dose within the irradiated volumes often complicate the optimization of dosimetry. The availability of dual-energy accelerators that deliver beams of low- and high-energy photons allows the convenient administration of mixed-energy photon irradiation and facilitates the development of optimal treatment strategies for selected lesions. Highly lateralized carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract, in which sparing of contralateral cervicofascial tissue is desirable, are particularly well suited for this technique. Treatment plans that make use of irradiation with conventional single-energy beams and mixed-energy photon therapy are compared for representative lesions of the head and neck.\r"

In 19 patients (80%) radiation therapy alone produced complete local control of the disease. In the five patients in whom treatment failed, the recurrent tumors were confined to the larynx and were noticed within 3 years of treatment. Surgery was subsequently performed in three of the five patients but was successful in only one. In 19 of the 24 patients, the voice sounded relatively normal after radiation therapy.\r"

Two image-processing approaches were compared for accuracy of liver measurements, intrasubject and interobserver variation, and speed of processing. Results indicated that both processing methods had a high degree of volume-measuring accuracy (within 8%), the interobserver measurements had a high coefficient of correlation (r = .9994), the intrasubject measurements had a low coefficient of variation (1.8%), and one method was four to five times faster than the other. The faster and easier of the two image-processing approaches provided satisfactory results for measuring liver volumes, but the slower approach provided more realistic-looking three-dimensional images of the liver.\r"

PspA was originally identified by monoclonal antibodies that can protect mice against intravenous challenge with some pneumococcal strains. A gene, pspA, required for the production of PspA was inactivated with use of insertional inactivation. By immunizing CBA/N (Xid) mice with congenic PspA+ and PspA- pneumococci, it was possible to demonstrate that PspA can elicit protective antipneumococcal antibodies. This result may be significant to future vaccine research, since Xid mice, like children, are not responsive to the present pneumococcal vaccine. When pspA was inactivated in three virulent, encapsulated strains of pneumococci, all three strains showed a reduction in virulence and two became totally avirulent: the 50% lethal dose was less than 10 colony-forming units (cfu) for the parents and greater than 5 x 10(4) cfu for the PspA- mutants.\r"

Virulent strains are also resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum and fail to bind complement components on the cell surface. In contrast, avirulent strains are serum-sensitive and both C3 and C9 are deposited on the surface. Results of experiments suggest that the shift from virulence to avirulence of L. pneumophila may be the result of the selection of a small number of avirulent cells present in the population of a virulent culture.\r"

Results with both chymotrypsin and the staphylococcal V8 protease for MOMP of serovar F indicated that many of the shared surface epitopes are clustered in one region whereas the serovar-reactive epitope is located in a separate region. Analysis of MOMPs from all the serovars with a species-specific monoclonal antibody indicated that each MOMP possesses a structurally analogous region that expresses this epitope. Such a region might play a role in pathogenic mechanisms that are shared by all serovars.\r"

Evidence presented here suggests that the molecular mechanisms underlying these events may be equally conserved. This article describes the structure and function of fasciclin II, a glycoprotein expressed on a subset of fasciculating axons in the grasshopper embryo. Antibody perturbation experiments suggest that fasciclin II functions in mediating one form of neuronal recognition: selective fasciculation. Fasciclin II is a member of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and is homologous in structure and function to the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM and to several other vertebrate cell adhesion molecules.\r"

In monkeys, such grafts survive for many months and reverse signs of parkinsonism, without attendant graft rejection. The successful and reliable application of a similar transplantation procedure to human patients, however, will require neural tissue obtained from human fetal cadavers, with demonstrated cellular identity, viability, and biological safety. In this report, human fetal neural tissue was successfully grafted into the brains of monkeys. Neural tissue was collected from human fetal cadavers after 9 to 12 weeks of gestation and cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. Viability after up to 2 months of storage was demonstrated by cell culture and by transplantation into monkeys. Cryopreservation and storage of human fetal neural tissue would allow formation of a tissue bank. The stored cells could then be specifically tested to assure their cellular identity, viability, and bacteriological and virological safety before clinical use. The capacity to collect and maintain viable human fetal neural tissue would also facilitate research efforts to understand the development and function of the human brain and provide opportunities to study neurological diseases.\r"

A new culture system was designed to study the oscillations in growth during development. Lens growth and transparency in vitro required pulsatile delivery of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in HL-1 serum-free medium. Continuous delivery of HL-1 medium with PDGF or pulsatile delivery of HL-1 medium without PDGF resulted in lens opacity and no growth. These results provide direct evidence that PDGF stimulates an epithelial tissue and that oscillations in growth occur during normal development of the rat lens.\r"

The complex is stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds between the protein and the sugar-phosphate backbone. Several side chains form hydrogen bonds with sites in the major groove, and hydrophobic contacts also contribute to the specificity of binding. The overall arrangement of the complex is quite similar to that predicted from earlier modeling studies, which fit the protein dimer against linear B-form DNA. However, the cocrystal structure reveals important side chain-side chain interactions that were not predicted from the modeling or from previous genetic and biochemical studies.\r"

The different affinity of repressor for each of these sites ensures efficient regulation. High-resolution x-ray crystallography was used to study the DNA-binding domain of phage 434 repressor in complex with a synthetic DNA operator. The structure shows recognition of the operator by direct interactions with base pairs in the major groove, combined with the sequence-dependent ability of DNA to adopt the required conformation on binding repressor. In particular, a network of three-centered bifurcated hydrogen bonds among base pairs in the operator helps explain why 434 repressor prefers certain sites over others. These bonds, which stabilize the conformation of the bound DNA, can form only with certain sequences.\r"

This increase included deaths from AIDS increasing from 0 to 905 and deaths from other causes, many of which were infectious diseases, increasing from 492 to 1091. Investigations of these deaths suggest a causal association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. These deaths may represent a spectrum of HIV-related disease that has not been identified through AIDS surveillance and has resulted in a large underestimation of the impact of AIDS on IV drug users and blacks and Hispanics.\r"

A footprinting assay showed that the homeo domain binds specifically to a TAA repeat DNA sequence in the Antp gene. Thus the Antp homeo domain has a sequence-specific DNA binding property. The circular dichroism spectra of the homeo domain peptide showed the presence of a significant amount of alpha-helical structure in aqueous solution and in 50 percent trifluoroethanol. The alpha helicity measured in water appears to depend on the peptide concentration, which suggests that the peptide aggregates. These results support the hypothesis that the homeo domain binds to DNA through a helix-turn-helix motif.\r"

In consuming H2O2 and being reduced by glutathione, ovothiol acts as a glutathione peroxidase and replaces the function of the enzyme in eggs.

Most of the methylated adenosine residues in prolactin mRNA are in the 3' untranslated region. The site of methylation in the 3' end of prolactin mRNA was determined. This methylation reaction is highly specific; of the three adenosine residues in consensus sequences located in the 3' end, only one is methylated. An in vitro methylation system was developed in which bovine prolactin mRNA, synthesized in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase, was accurately methylated in a HeLa cell nuclear extract. The adenosine residue that was methylated in vitro was the same as the one methylated in vivo. This cell-free system, which accurately methylates the N6-position of adenosine residues in mRNA, will allow further study of the mechanism of adenosine methylation.\r"

From January 1975 through June 1984, 58 male patients and 14 female patients, ranging in age from 6 to 72 years, were treated for traumatic perforations of the diaphragm. These injuries resulted from gunshot wounds in 44 patients (61%), stab wounds in 13 (18%), blunt trauma in 11 (15%), and shotgun wounds in four (6%). Seventy-three percent of the injuries were to the left hemidiaphragm, 26% to the right, and 1% to both. Signs and symptoms were unreliable for making the diagnosis of perforation. Diagnosis depended mainly on preoperative chest roentgenograms (especially for those caused by blunt trauma), thorough intraoperative exploration, and a high index of suspicion. Overall mortality was 7%, but death was usually more readily attributable to associated injuries than to the diaphragmatic injuries.\r"

Forty patients (57%) received perioperative antibiotics, and 15 (19%) had positive intraoperative bile cultures. During follow-up, the only septic complications identified were wound infections in two patients (3%); one of them had received antibiotics and one had not. Each bile culture cost $60 to $80, and the cultures were not clinically useful. In the absence of risk factors associated with positive bile cultures, the incidence of wound infections or septic complications after cholecystectomy is low. We conclude that routine intraoperative bile cultures and prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated for elective cholecystectomy in low-risk patients.\r"

Thirty eyes were stabilized by photocoagulation, though 25 required long-term glaucoma medications. Six eyes required additional procedures. Vision deteriorated in 21 of the 36 eyes (nine eyes finally having \"no light perception\") during the 32.8-month follow-up. Intraocular pressure averaged 39.0 mm Hg before photocoagulation and 21.2 mm Hg at study's end. All 36 eyes were retained and remain comfortable.

  ".W": "Among the problems that confront the vascular surgeon, a pulsatile, right-sided neck mass requires a careful and logical evaluation. It has long been known that tortuosity of the right common carotid artery, frequently associated with advanced hypertension, can physically mimic a right carotid aneurysm. The question, then, is whether carotid angiography, with a higher attendant risk of morbidity and mortality, is preferable to less invasive diagnostic modalities such as computerized tomography (CT) and ultrasonography for initial evaluation. In our study, 31 consecutive patients with a pulsatile right neck mass, indistinguishable on physical examination from a carotid aneurysm, were evaluated using CT scan of the neck and either radionuclide scan or angiography. In all of the patients, the masses were confirmed to be tortuous right common carotid arteries and not aneurysms. Because a kinked carotid artery simulating an aneurysm occurs so frequently, noninvasive diagnostic techniques, such as CT and ultrasonography, should precede angiography. We also discuss demographic characteristics commonly associated with tortuosity of the right common carotid artery.\r"

Esophageal candidiasis did not necessarily imply the presence of oral candidiasis, and conversely, oral candidiasis did not imply esophageal candidiasis. Odynophagia was associated with significant histologic ulcerations in eight of ten patients. In the patients who had odynophagia, biopsy was almost equally likely to show Candida or viral cytopathic effect. We discuss the clinicopathologic implications of these findings.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, the authors evaluated the stiffness of motion segments in intact spines in two spine fracture models, and with each of five implant systems used for posterior fixation of thoracolumbar spine fractures. The devices represented a cross-section of types, including those employing sublaminar wires with and without laminar hooks, pedicle screws, plates, and rods. Two spine fracture models, one partially and one totally destabilized, were used in the tests of the instrumentation. Stiffness, or the magnitude of load needed to produce a unit displacement of the construct in the direction of the applied load, was measured in flexion, extension, lateral bending, and torsion in combination with a compressive force. Both horizontal plane shear and angular displacements were measured in the two fracture patterns. All evaluations were made by testing the difference in stiffness for statistical significance among groups. The results showed significant differences in stiffness without instrumentation among intact spines, partly destabilized spines (anterior two-thirds of disk and posterior ligaments removed), and totally destabilized spines (only anterior longitudinal ligament intact). The implant/spine constructs were least stiff relative to the intact spine in torsion, followed in increasing order of stiffness with flexion, lateral bending, and extension. In the Roy-Camille plate with six-screw fixation was found to produce the stiffest construct, followed by wired Harrington rods, C-rods and J-rods, and the Vermont internal fixator.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This project consisted of a detailed histologic and histochemical analysis of the distribution of muscle spindles in paraspinal musculature of patients suffering from idiopathic scoliosis, using the reduced form of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NADH), adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), and Tri-chrome stain techniques. Muscle biopsy samples were taken at operation for spinal instrumentation from each of 13 patients (mean age: 16.2 years; 3 males, 10 females) with all but one female exhibiting right thoracic curves. The samples were collected from two specific sites (superficial and deep) on both sides of the vertebral column at the level of the apex of the primary curve and two vertebral levels above and below the apex. From the results there appear to be few muscle spindles in the scoliotic muscle of this region. All of the patients from whom muscle samples were taken possessed at least one sample with a muscle spindle. However, each patient had very few samples which contained a minimum of one muscle spindle (mean: 20.3%; SD: 12.6). It is clear that further examination is necessary, particularly in the area of comparison with 'normal' standards when these standards become available.\r"

Harrington distraction was performed in 36 rats that had been made scoliotic 9-12 weeks earlier by the method described in the previous paper. Distractions were carried out in discrete and timed steps until separation of the vertebral laminae (mechanical failure) occurred at the upper hook site. Distractive forces were monitored continuously by a strain gauge mounted on the tension side of the upper arm of the outrigger. The resulting data were compared among the various curvature groups. The relationship between the length of distraction and the maximum force produced was similar for all animals regardless of curvature. This relationship was quadratic and was characterized by an inflection point where forces increased rapidly with each distraction. The amount of distraction necessary to reach both the inflection and failure points differed only for curves above 100 degrees. The amount of force required to reach failure was lower for curves above 75 degrees. Curves above 50 degrees had a lower percent correction at the inflection point. Bending and tensile forces were calculated by vector analysis. Axial load efficiencies were greater for curves above 50 degrees, as evidenced by increased bending forces in these animals. The viscoelasticity of the spine decreased after inflection in all animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

For compliant patients, the average improvement in kyphosis was 27% in the Boston orthosis group and 35% in the Milwaukee orthosis group, despite the fact that the former group were younger and had smaller, more flexible curves. Compliance with orthosis wearing and, therefore, effective treatment was twice as likely with the Boston orthosis (61% compliance vs. 29% with the Milwaukee). Results in patients who wore their orthoses at least 16 hours per day were equal to results in patients with 23 hours of daily wear. In a small group of compliant patients with kyphotic deformities greater than 75 degrees, the Milwaukee orthosis was surprisingly effective. The Boston lumbar kyphosis orthosis offers a satisfactory alternative to the modified Milwaukee brace in adolescent kyphosis patients whose curves measure less than 70 degrees, especially if satisfactory compliance with brace wear is suspect.\r"

Previous studies using hydrogen washout, an invasive technique, have shown that trimethaphan-induced hypotension is associated with a decrease in SCBF, whereas hypotension induced with sodium nitroprusside or nitroglycerin is not. To determine whether the decrease seen with trimethaphan represented a generalized rather than regional spinal cord phenomenon, SCBF was measured at three separate cord levels (T2-3, 7-8, L2-3) using a noninvasive radionuclide-labelled microsphere technique. When the mean arterial pressure was reduced by 50%, SCBF decreased 35 to 45% at all levels of the cord examined, and remained at this reduced level during the period of hypotension. The results confirm that trimethaphan-induced hypotension is associated with a significant reduction in SCBF and that this occurs throughout the spinal cord during the period of hypotension.\r"

During the surgical procedure, hemodynamic control was easily maintained. Blood loss was slightly less than 50% of blood volume and the mean infusion rate of blood was 6.3 +/- 4.5 ml/kg/hour for the duration of surgery. The technique did not significantly interfere with wake-up tests, and memory of awakening was only observed in one case. The postoperative course was also positively affected. The children could be extubated within the 30 minutes following completion of surgery, and they could perform effective breathing exercises early on. High degree and long duration (36 to 72 hours) of pain relief were obtained in every case. No major adverse effect was observed. Thus, the administration of intrathecal morphine prior to spinal fusion appears to be safe, easy, and reliable. We think it should be recommended for major surgery of the rachis.\r"

Common dural sac indentation by the wires during extraction averaged 47% of the total myelographic column width, with no correlation to time implanted. Epidural, subdural, and intramedullary hemorrhage, epidural adhesions, dural lacerations, cord indentations, and neural damage were all present with no correlation to time implanted. Dural thinning was more pronounced in later specimens. These data suggest that sublaminar wires are not innocuous to the dural sac and its contents in this canine experimental model.\r"

Because of the inability to visualize the wire tip during its sublaminar passage, the surgeon is unable to appreciate the depth of wire penetration (DOWP). The purpose of this investigation was to determine, through direct measurement, the depth of intraspinal penetration during the passage of sublaminar wires. Using their model, the authors have been able to define the optimal parameters for safe wire passage. Careful attention to maintaining contact between the wire tip and the under-surface of the lamina, using a wire of optimal configuration, will result in minimal DOWP and reduce the possibility of neurologic compromise.\r"

  ".W": "In an attempt to assess the value of the Cotrel-Dubousset (CD) system for adult spinal disorders, the first 50 adult cases performed at Johns Hopkins were reviewed. Treatment of adult scoliosis with the CD system yielded results comparable to standard techniques. Curve correction was directly proportional to the preoperative flexibility with no loss of correction in any case. All patients went on to a solid arthrodesis, with only three patients requiring the use of postoperative orthoses. Operative time was initially prolonged during the phase of acquiring expertise with the system; however, blood loss and hospitalization were comparable. In both the scoliosis and kyphosis groups instrumentation and fusion incorporated the same number of levels as would have been required for conventional instrumentation systems. In the spondylolisthesis, tumor and trauma groups a total of 88 transpedicle screws was used in 18 patients without neurologic complications. Pedicle screws provided a fixation alternative in cases requiring laminectomies. In the 25 cases with tumors, spondylolisthesis, and trauma, CD instrumentation reduced the number of vertebral levels required for fixation. Compared to Harrington or Luque systems, the average number of motion segments spared per patient was 1.3 in the spondylolisthesis group, 2 in the tumor group and 2.1 in the trauma group. This study suggests that the CD system, although initially developed for idiopathic adolescent scoliosis, is versatile and can be safely and effectively applied to a variety of adult spinal conditions. In cases of spinal pathology due to neoplasm, spondylolisthesis, and trauma, CD instrumentation with the option of transpedicle fixation appeared to offer significant advantages over conventional methods, and an average of 1.6 lumbar motion segments could be preserved per case.\r"

This investigation was undertaken to validate the hypothesis that substance P and VIP, known to be produced in the dorsal root ganglion cell bodies, will be affected by low frequency vibration. Three New Zealand white rabbits were vibrated at discrete frequencies (2-10 Hz) to determine the resonant frequency of the rabbit spine. The resonating frequency was in the (3.5-5.0 Hz) range. The peak amplitude was at 4.5 Hz. Ten female New Zealand white rabbits were then paired into two groups of five. One group served as a control and had exactly the same procedures performed as the experimental group except for the vibration. The L4-5 and L5-6 dorsal root ganglia were removed bilaterally and prepared for substance P and VIP extraction by radioimmunoassay technique. The control rabbits mean immunoreactive substance P was 14.06 pg/ml tissue, whereas the experimental or vibrated rabbits had a mean of 8.40 pg/ml (P less than 0.003). The control rabbits mean immunoreactive vasoactive intestinal peptide was 9.58 pg/ml whereas the experimental or vibrated rabbits had a mean of 20.9 pg/ml, P less than 0.07. Substance P is only one of several dorsal root ganglion neuropeptides that may play a role in nociceptor transmission. VIP is a neuropeptide that plays a role in reorganization of the nervous system following injury. The effects of low frequency vibration on dorsal root ganglion transmitters are essential to the understanding of vibration as a cause of back pain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Intrasubject comparison of barefoot and high-heeled stance showed that the wearing of high heels caused lumbar flattening, a backward tilting pelvis, a reduction of the distance of the knee and ankle from the line of gravity, and a posterior displacement of the head and thoracic spine. The alignment at the greater trochanter did not vary with heel height, perhaps indicating a need to maintain a constant extending moment loading at the hip joint. The change in lumbar lordosis measured in high-heeled stance is inconsistent with clinical findings of hyperlordosis in habitual wearers of high-heeled shoes. It is possible, however, that changes in postural muscle tone due to the altered pelvic inclination may, in the long term, result in hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine.\r"

The diagnosis is confirmed by abnormal discography with concordant pain reproduction at the affected level or levels. Thirty-four patients with internal disc disruption at one level were followed for an average of 29 months. Eighteen (53%) underwent anterior lumbar fusion at the L4-5 disc, 11 (32%) at the L5-S1 disc and the remainder at the L3-4 or L2-3 disc. Bank bone was used in all but seven patients for interbody fusion. Treatment was judged a success by the patient returning to work or normal activities and requiring either no medications or an antiinflammatory drug only. By the above criteria 25 patients (74%) had successful outcome of treatment. The average time to return to work or normal activities was 6.1 months. The overall union rate was 73% with an average time to union of approximately 12 months. Complications consisted of graft extrusion requiring revision and retrograde ejaculation. These occurred in one patient and were the only complications in the series. We concluded that disc excision and anterior interbody fusion is an effective treatment for internal disc disruption.\r"

  ".W": "Seventy-seven consecutive patients underwent application of variable spine plating (VSP) spinal plates between August 1984 and October 1985. Sixty-four percent had previous procedures at the same level or levels operated. Operative indications were spinal stenosis, segmental instability, unstable spondylolisthesis, herniated disc with instability, pseudoarthrosis, unstable fracture, and failed surgery syndrome with evidence of one of the preceding. Overall results showed 30% excellent, 30% good, 34% fair, 6% poor. There were four deep wound infections and 19 patients with one or more broken screws. Screw alignment and the angular relationship of each screw to the spinal plate are considered important technical factors in minimizing screw failure. Vigorous distraction of the vertebrae using interpedicular screws is rarely indicated. Twenty-four patients required reoperation. We feel the procedure is relatively indicated in cases of moderate to severe instability, such as some cases of spondylolisthesis, failed surgery with marked segmental instability, the obese, deconditioned patient, or cases of spinal stenosis rendered very unstable by surgical decompression, and most strongly indicated in unstable lumbar and thoracolumbar fractures.\r"

The most common etiology of this deformity is extensive laminectomies, especially associated with postlaminectomy irradiation. The deformity can be rapidly progressive leading to neurologic involvement. With intact posterior elements, kyphosis can occur as a result of congenital, traumatic, metabolic or neoplastic processes. Treatment is directed towards early recognition, arrest of the progression of deformity, and improvement of neurologic symptoms. Patients with loss of posterior elements can be treated effectively by preoperative traction and a single-staged anterior release with strut fusion. Patients with intact posterior elements require preoperative traction, initial posterior osteotomies with intraoperative traction, then an anterior release with strut fusion. All patients need rigid postoperative halo immobilization for a minimum of 3 to 4 months to maintain position. Using these techniques, nine patients were treated surgically with satisfactory outcomes.\r"

At an average follow-up of 3 years, all grafts were fully incorporated, all cervical spinal columns were stable and had no deformity, and none of the fixation devices had loosened. All complete neurologic deficits have remained complete, and all patients with incomplete deficits have had significant recovery and are walking independently. There were no operative complications. After decompressive vertebral corpectomy, anterior plate stabilization followed by short-term halo-vest fixation is a safe and useful alternative for unstable bursting teardrop fractures of the cervical spinal column.\r"

  ".W": "A series of 190 patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis treated operatively during the years 1948-80 at the mean age of 15.2 years (8-19 years) and reexamined 4-36 years (mean 11.2 years) later are presented. In 92 of them (48%) scoliosis (more than 5 degrees) in association with olisthesis was seen. The slipping affected the fifth segment in 90 and fourth segment in two patients. The female predominance was characteristic in the scoliotic group. Dysplastic changes of the posterior arc were more often seen in the group of patients with scoliosis than in the nonscoliotic group, and they also presented a more severe grade of slipping and lumbosacral kyphosis. The curve was usually mild and was situated in the lumbar area. Patients with a higher degree of lumbosacral kyphosis and more severe slipping also had a statistically higher degree of lumbar scoliosis. Operative treatment of spondylolisthesis consisted of posterior or posterolateral fusion in situ, but two patients were treated using ventral fusion and three severe cases with removal of loose posterior element. Lumbar scoliosis classified as sciatic type disappeared in 25 out of 39 patients after lumbosacral fusion, suggesting the \"sciatic muscle spasm\" as an etiologic factor. The torsional type of curve resulting from asymmetrical slipping of the vertebra was also corrected in 19 out of 28 cases after fusion. At follow-up patients with remaining lumbar scoliosis represented more low-back pain than those without any curve. In our opinion lumbosacral fusion is indicated before lumbar curve changes to structural scoliosis in symptomatic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Classical approaches involve various types of myelotomies, rhizotomies and intrathecal injections of neurolytic substances. Alternative approaches include percutaneous rhizotomies and, more recently, the possible use of electrical stimulation of the spinal cord. Certain cases, however, may not be amenable to commonly accepted techniques. An operative technique is presented which involves a suprapubic incision for an infraperitoneal approach to a femoral and obturator neurectomy and an incision of the iliacus and psoas muscles bilaterally. This may be followed, when indicated, by a bilateral infragluteal section of the sciatic nerves. This technique offers a viable surgical alternative to the treatment of spasticity following spinal cord injury in cases where other traditional methods are contraindicated or have failed.\r"

Repeating the ELISA using Protein A-treated nucleus pulposus showed that the ELISA was greatly diminished in activity, confirming the presence of whole molecules of IgG in nucleus pulposus. Investigators have postulated an immunologic basis for spinal pain syndromes. None to date has demonstrated IgG in the nucleus pulposus.

The intrinsic and maximum pressures were found to be inversely related to disc degeneration grade, and directly related to each other. Relatively greater degeneration was found at lower levels of the lumbar spine as compared to the upper levels. The intrinsic disc pressure may prove to be a useful clinical tool in the evaluation of spinal integrity.\r"

All patients were studied with an infrared telethermographic unit (AGA model 720M) employing the technical standards recommended by the Academy of Neuromuscular Thermography. The thermographic exams were interpreted independently and in a blind fashion by two radiologists. Of the 15 exams of asymptomatic patients, six were interpreted as positive and consistent with nerve fiber irritation. Of the 19 exams of patients with demonstrated CT abnormalities, all had positive thermograms for nerve fiber irritation (specificity 60%, sensitivity 100%). It is concluded that lumbar thermography is a sensitive examination for detecting those patients who will demonstrate lumbar spinal CT abnormalities and should play an important role in the diagnostic screening of low-back pain syndrome patients.\r"

Twenty patients had peroneal nerve entrapments at or above the popliteal space. Nine patients had tibial nerve entrapments in the popliteal space. The diagnosis was established on the basis of electrophysiologic studies coupled with the results of selective spinal and peripheral nerve blocks. Seven patients with saphenous nerve lesions, 12 patients with peroneal nerve lesions, nine patients with tibial nerve lesions, and four patients with femoral nerve lesions, for a total of 32 (71%) cases underwent surgical exploration and external neurolysis. Forty-four percent of the cases had a positive nerve root tension sign, and 44% (20/45) had spinal range of motion abnormalities. Back pain complaints were noted in 49% (22/45) of the cases.

  ".W": "Sandostatin (SMS 201-995 (SMS)), a potent, long acting analog of native somatostatin was used in five patients with functional endocrine tumors (gastrinoma, two patients; insulinoma, one patient; glucagonoma, one, and adult onset nesidioblastosis, one). Primary and secondary peptide levels were obtained during provocation with a test meal, a calcium infusion, a secretin bolus and either a glucagon or tolbutamide bolus. During provocation test, the levels of the primary peptides insulin and C-peptide (nesidioblastosis and insulinoma), gastrin (gastrinoma), glucagon (glucagonoma) and the secondary peptides calcitonin, gastrointestinal peptide, gastrin releasing peptide, motilin, neurotensin, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin, substance-P and vasoactive intestinal peptide were obtained at predetermined intervals and quantitated by radioimmunoassay. SMS therapy was begun and peptide levels were again obtained during provocation. SMS suppressed basal primary peptide levels in all patients by more than 50 per cent. In 23 of 26 provocative tests, SMS effectively decreased circulating peptide levels by more than 50 per cent. Thirteen instances of elevated basal secondary peptides were discovered, and SMS universally suppressed these levels by a mean of 54 per cent. Of the 44 provocative tests performed, elevated secondary peptide levels were present in 41. SMS was effective in 31 of these 41 tests. The mean suppression of these provoked secondary peptide levels was 70 per cent. SMS effectively suppresses both basal and provoked peptides and, thus, provides relief of the clinical symptoms induced by pathologic elevations of primary and secondary peptides.\r"

In patients with familial hypertriglyceridemia, the biochemical changes are greatly enhanced during pregnancy and may be associated with acute pancreatitis, a potentially fatal triad. Three patients were studied, in one of whom previously undiagnosed hyperlipidemia resulted in a fatal attack of fulminant acute pancreatitis. In the other two patients, this complication was avoided by close monitoring and restriction of dietary facts. A history of episodic abdominal cramps, often beginning in early childhood, or the presence of lipemic fasting plasma should alert the clinician to the presence of severe familial hypertriglyceridemia. Early diagnosis allows for the institution of relatively simple management strategies, which diminish the risk of pancreatitis.\r"

At discharge, patients under took an enzyme supplementation regimen with pancreatin (18, 00 United States Pharmacopoeia units of lipase per meal). Patients were rehospitalized 24.9 months after PD plus NI to undergo nutritional and metabolic evaluation (hospital control). Nutritional status was evaluated by measuring the serum albumin level, total iron binding capacity and total lymphocyte count. Digestive function was assessed by the D-xylose tolerance test and determination of fecal fat excretion. Patients were then discharged with pancrelipase, enteric-coated microspheres (ECM) supplementation (16,050 United States Pharmacopoeia units of lipase per meal). Malnutrition, defined as the occurrence of at least two abnormal nutritional parameters, was observed in six patients at hospital control. After six months on pancrelipase ECM, the nutritional status was re-evaluated in nine patients (three previously malnourished) who were all well nourished. The mean body weight was 84.7 per cent of usual body weight at discharge after PD plus NI and raised to 88.0 per cent at the hospital control (p less than 0.01) and to 93.7 per cent )p less than 0.05) after six months on pancrelipase ECM. At hospital control, results from the D-xylose test were normal in all patients, and steatorrhea dropped from 33.6 grams per day without enzyme supplementation to 15.3 grams per day with pancrelipase ECM (16,050 United States Pharmacopoeia units of lipase per meal). Steatorrhea was incompletely but satisfactorily corrected by pancrelipase ECM. On supplementation therapy with pancrelipase ECM, patients recover a good deal of the body weight and normalize the biochemical indices of malnutrition.\r"

Although final decision for operative decompression should be based on clinical findings as well as on the direct measurements, the increased availability of this monitoring system could allow us to understand better the pathophysiologic basis of compartment syndrome. This would make earlier detection or even prevention of this condition possible.\r"

Surgical extirpation of the venous angioma was performed in all nine cases. An additional resection of a frontal venous angioma was performed in a woman with intractable seizures and headache. We experienced limited morbidity and no mortality. Although venous angiomas may be uncommon clinically, they have a significant potential for hemorrhage, and particularly, rehemorrhage if left untreated.\r"

  ".W": "Two series of patients with a minor head injury (for a total of 182 cases), differing only in the presence and absence of a linear skull fracture, were admitted to a nonspecialized hospital and prospectively examined by computed tomography scanning. The presence of a fracture line proved to be significant, inasmuch as it was accompanied by approximately 38% of intracranial abnormalities versus 6% in the nonfracture cases. Early detection of any intracranial pathology that was still asymptomatic allowed prompt transfer of patients to the neurosurgical center, where operative treatment was carried out, when indicated, without mortality or morbidity. All operations (11 cases) were performed on patients with a fracture (105 cases) whereas none of the nonfracture patients (77 cases) required surgery. It is proposed that adult patients with minor head injuries with a skull fracture be submitted to computed tomography scanning in order that intracranial lesions may be detected, and treated, before the onset of clinical deterioration.\r"

The operative microscope facilitated dissecting and preserving the carotid artery and cranial nerves transversing the sinus. Venous bleeding was controlled by packing. There was one death unrelated to cavernous sinus surgery. Five patients, however, had complications related to cavernous sinus surgery, including hemiplegia in one patient and cranial nerve palsy in four.\r"
