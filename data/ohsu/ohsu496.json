The three most common inherited coagulation disorders are factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A), factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B), and von Willebrand's disease. Vitamin K deficiency, liver disease, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are the most common acquired disorders. A thorough clinical history is crucial to diagnosis. Screening tests that measure prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, thrombin time, and platelet count permit initial classification and guide selection of more specific tests. Results can then be used to determine appropriate therapy.\r"

The most common systemic causes are metabolic diseases; central or peripheral nervous system diseases are less often responsible. Most systemic diseases that cause muscle cramps are amenable to specific treatment. If symptomatic treatment is desired, the first choice would appear to be stretching. If that is ineffective, carisoprodol (Rela, Soma, Soprodol), vitamin E, or verapamil hydrochloride (Calan, Isoptin) may be used. Quinine sulfate (Quine, Quinamm) is potentially toxic and may not be effective.\r"

The excision of a mispaired nucleotide occurs at a significantly greater rate than excision of a correctly paired nucleotide and, under conditions of DNA synthesis, hydrolysis of a mispaired terminal nucleotide occurs prior to primer extension. The 3'----5' exonuclease copurifies quantitatively with DNA polymerase gamma and cosediments with the nearly homogeneous enzyme under native conditions. These results suggest that the 3'----5' exonuclease provides a proofreading function to enhance the fidelity of DNA synthesis during Drosophila mitochondrial DNA replication.\r"

Both proteins were found to contain a peptide sequence reminiscent of a leucine-repeat motif (\"leucine-zipper\") that is also found in the myc, fos, and jun oncogenes. Synthetic peptide antiserum directed against a portion of the mouse Rb protein detects three proteins of 104-110 kDa in cells that were transiently transfected with a mouse Rb gene expression construct. In the mouse embryo the expression of Rb mRNA was ubiquitous, with maximal expression being observed around 13 days of gestation. In the embryo, the highest level of expression was observed in liver and brain. In contrast, the Rb gene was found to be expressed at a very low level in adult mouse liver with high levels being found in lung, thymus, and spleen. A shorter Rb transcript was detected in mouse testes.\r"

Wild-type T antigen produced in bacteria retained a specific subset of the biochemical activities displayed by its mammalian counterpart. Escherichia coli T antigen functioned as a helicase and bound to DNA fragments containing either site I or the wild-type origin of replication in a manner identical to mammalian T antigen. However, T antigen purified from E. coli did not efficiently bind to site II, an essential cis element within the simian virus 40 origin of replication. It therefore could not unwind origin-containing plasmids or efficiently replicate simian virus 40 DNA in vitro. The ability of protein phosphorylation to modulate the intrinsic preference of full-length T antigen for either site I or site II is discussed.\r"

It is less stable at high and low temperatures than TF1, and the complex dissociates into subunits during native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The alpha 3 beta 3 complex has about 20% of the ATPase activity of TF1. Its enzymic properties are similar to those of the native TF1, exhibiting similar cooperative kinetics as a function of ATP concentration, similar substrate specificity for nucleotide triphosphates, and the presence of two peaks in its temperature-activity profile. Differing from TF1, the ATPase activity of the alpha 3 beta 3 complex is insensitive to N3- inhibition, its divalent cation specificity is less stringent, and its optimum pH shifts to the alkaline side. The addition of the gamma subunit to the alpha 3 beta 3 complex leads to the formation of the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma complex, indicating that the alpha 3 beta 3 complex is an intermediate in the process of assembly of the holoenzyme from each subunit. These results definitely show that the essential structure for eliciting the ATPase activity of F1-ATPase is trimeric alpha beta pairs and that the kinetic cooperativity of the F1-ATPase is an inherent property of this trimeric structure but is not due to the presence of single-copy subunits. In this sense, the alpha 3 beta 3 complex is the catalytic core of F1-ATPase.\r"

The deduced amino acid sequence is similar to TS from other organisms and is most closely related to the enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae with 65% identity. TS is found on a 330-kilobase-pair chromosome in P. carinii. While TS and dihydrofolate reductase reside on a single polypeptide chain in all protozoa studied to date, TS is not linked to dihydrofolate reductase in P. carinii. The TS gene shows the presence of four small intervening sequences, some of which interrupt the coding sequence in highly ordered structural regions of the protein. Heterologous expression of P. carinii TS in E. coli was accomplished by cloning the coding sequence into plasmid vectors under control of the lac and tac promoters. These constructs direct the synthesis of catalytically active enzyme to the extent of 2% of total soluble protein.\r"

A full-length fusion protein is obtained when the new gene is placed under transcriptional control of a T7 promoter in Escherichia coli. Bioluminescence of colonies containing the gene fusion is 0.002% of the wild-type luciferase [alkanal monooxygenase (FMN-linked); alkanal, reduced-FMN:oxygen oxidoreductase (1-hydroxylating, luminescing), EC 1.14.14.3] at 37 degrees C. Growth at 23 degrees C results in a greater than 50,000-fold increase in light emission in cells containing fusion protein, whereas only a 3-fold increase in observed with cells containing the luxAB dicistron. Purified fusion protein isolated from E. coli grown at 19 degrees C exists in both monomeric and dimeric forms with specific bioluminescence activities comparable to the heterodimeric wild-type enzyme at 23 degrees C and 37 degrees C. These findings show that the alpha beta fusion polypeptide is functional as a monomer and suggest that its folding is drastically affected at elevated temperature. We hypothesize that the two-subunit bacterial luciferase may have evolved from a monomer as a result of a temperature increase in the environment.\r"

In liver, these two activities belong to separate domains of the same 470-residue polypeptide. Various mRNAs have been described for this bifunctional enzyme, which is controlled by hormonal and metabolic signals. To understand the origin and regulation of these mRNAs, we have characterized rat genomic clones encoding the liver isozyme, which is regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and the muscle isozyme, which is not. We describe here a 55-kilobase gene that encodes these isozymes by alternative splicing from two promoters. Each of the putative promoters was sequenced over about 3 kilobases and found to include nucleotide motifs for binding regulatory factors. The two isozymes share the same 13 exons and differ only by the first exon that, in the liver but not in the muscle isozyme, contains the serine phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The gene was assigned to the X chromosome. An analysis of the exon limits of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase in relation to its functional domains and to its similarity with other proteins plus its G + C content at the third codon position suggests that this gene originates from several fusion events.\r"

  ".W": "We have demonstrated that the noncovalent complex formed between DNA and an antitumor bifunctional intercalator, ditercalinium, is recognized in vitro as bulky covalent DNA lesions by the purified Escherichia coli UvrABC endonuclease. It was established that no covalent drug-DNA adduct was formed during the incubation of the drug with DNA or during subsequent incubation with the UvrAB proteins. The nucleoprotein-ditercalinium complexes appear different from those generated by repair of pyrimidine dimers. The UvrA protein is able to form a stable complex with ditercalinium-intercalated DNA in the presence of ATP, whereas both UvrA and UvrB proteins are required to form a stable complex with pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA. The apparent half-life of the UvrA- and UvrAB-ditercalinium-DNA complexes following removal of free ditercalinium is 5 min. However, if the free ditercalinium concentration is maintained to allow the intercalation of one molecule of ditercalinium per 3000 base pairs, the half-life of the UvrA- or UvrAB-ditercalinium-DNA complex is 50 min, comparable to that of the complex of UvrAB proteins formed with pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA. UvrABC endonuclease incises ditercalinium-intercalated DNA as efficiently as pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA. However, unlike repair of pyrimidine dimers, the incision reaction is strongly favored by the supercoiling of the DNA substrate. Because UvrA- or UvrAB-ditercalinium-DNA complexes can be formed with relaxed DNA without leading to a subsequent incision reaction, these apparently dead-end nucleoprotein complexes may become lesions in themselves resulting in the cytotoxicity of ditercalinium. Our results show that binding of excision repair proteins to a noncovalent DNA-ligand complex may lead to cell toxicity.\r"

The new cysteines spontaneously formed disulfide bonds on exposure to air in vitro. In all cases the oxidized (crosslinked) lysozyme was more stable than the corresponding reduced (noncrosslinked) enzyme toward thermal denaturation. Relative to wild-type lysozyme, the melting temperatures of the 9-164 and 21-142 disulfide mutants were increased by 6.4 degrees C and 11.0 degrees C, whereas the other two mutants were either less stable or equally stable. Measurement of the equilibrium constants for the reduction of the engineered disulfide bonds by dithiothreitol indicates that the less thermostable mutants tend to have a less favorable crosslink in the native structure. The two disulfide bridges that are most effective in increasing the stability of T4 lysozyme have, in common, a large loop size and a location that includes a flexible part of the molecule. The results suggest that stabilization due to the effect of the crosslink on the entropy of the unfolded polypeptide is offset by the strain energy associated with formation of the disulfide bond in the folded protein. The design of disulfide bridges is discussed in terms of protein flexibility.\r"

  ".W": "The Escherichia coli UvrB protein possesses an amino acid sequence motif common to many ATPases. The role of this motif in UvrB has been investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. Three UvrB mutants, with amino acid replacements at lysine-45, failed to confer UV resistance when tested in the UV-sensitive strain N364 (delta uvrB), while five other mutants constructed near this region of UvrB confer wild-type levels of UV resistance. Because even the conservative substitution of arginine for lysine-45 in UvrB results in failure to confer UV resistance, we believe we have identified an amino acid side chain in UvrB essential to nucleotide excision repair in E. coli. The properties of two purified mutant UvrB proteins, lysine-45 to alanine (K45A) and asparagine-51 to alanine (N51A), were analyzed in vitro. While the K45A mutant is fully defective in incision of UV-irradiated DNA, K45A is capable of interaction with UvrA in forming an ATP-dependent nucleoprotein complex. The K45A mutant, however, fails to activate the characteristic increase in ATPase activity observed with the wild-type UvrB in the presence of UvrA and DNA. From these results we conclude that there is a second nucleotide-dependent step in incision following initial complex formation, which is defective in the K45A mutant. This experimental approach may prove of general applicability in the study of function and mechanism of other ATPase motif proteins.\r"

The electron transfer rate to QB remained essentially unimpaired. Consequently, it is postulated that the reduced turnover in the mutant is due to a reduced rate of proton transfer to QB2-. The lack of pH dependence of the forward electron transfer rate DQA-QB----DQAQB- and the back reaction rate D+QAQB- ----DQAQB (where D = primary donor and QA = primary acceptor) in the mutant RC indicate that the observed pH dependence in the native RC is due to Glu-212, which has an anomalously high pKa value of 9.5 +/- 0.3. These results support the involvement of Glu-212 as a proton donor to reduced QB.\r"

We quantified the rate of 32-kDa protein degradation over a broad spectral range (UV, visible, and far red). The quantum yield for degradation was highest in the UVB (280-320 nm) region. Spectral evidence demonstrates two distinctly different photosensitizers for 32-kDa protein degradation. The data implicate the bulk photosynthetic pigments (primarily chlorophyll) in the visible and far red regions, and plastoquinone (in one or more of its redox states) in the UV region. A significant portion of 32-kDa protein degradation in sunlight is attributed to UVB irradiance.\r"

Ras must be localized in the plasma membrane of vertebrate cells to function, but GAP is localized in the cytosol. To test whether Ras function depends on a cytosolic factor such as GAP, we microinjected into Xenopus oocytes a form of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RAS1 ([Leu68]RAS1 terminated at residue 185, called [Leu68]RAS1(term.] that lacks the consensus membrane localization site, does not respond to GAP in a GTPase assay, but binds to GAP 100-fold more tightly than [Val12]Ras. [Leu68]RAS1(term.) alone did not stimulate oocyte germinal-vesicle breakdown. Instead, [Leu68]RAS1(term.) was observed to inhibit the action of insulin-like growth factor 1 or microinjected [Val12]Ras but not the action of progesterone as monitored by germinal-vesicle breakdown. Coinjection of purified mammalian GAP with [Leu68]RAS1(term.) reduced the inhibition of [Val12]Ras-stimulated germinal-vesicle breakdown. The results raise the possibility that a cytosolic factor is required for the action of [Val12]Ras in Xenopus oocytes and that this factor is either GAP or another protein with which GAP can compete for binding to [Leu68]RAS1(term.).\r"

Spheres are variable in size (up to approximately 20 microns in diameter in the newt Notophthalmus and approximately 10 microns in the frog Xenopus) and are easily distinguishable from nucleoli by morphology and composition. Spheres occur both free in the nucleoplasm and attached to specific chromosome loci, the sphere organizers. Oocyte nuclei of a cricket and a spider contain essentially similar organelles, suggesting that spheres may be common throughout the animal kingdom. We suggest that spheres play a role in the assembly of snRNP complexes for the nucleus comparable to the way that nucleoli assemble ribosomal RNP complexes for the cytoplasm.\r"

Previous studies suggested that translocation of insulin or its receptor to cell nuclei might be involved in some of these processes. The present investigation demonstrated that intact insulin, but not the insulin receptor, accumulated in nuclei of insulin-treated cells. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated that the nuclear accumulation of 125I-labeled insulin was time-, temperature-, and insulin-concentration-dependent. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the insulin that accumulated in the nucleus was immunologically intact and associated with the heterochromatin. Only 1% of the 125I-labeled insulin extracted from isolated nuclei was eluted from a Sephadex G-50 column as 125I-labeled tyrosine. Plasma membrane insulin receptors were not detected in the nucleus by immuno electron microscopy or when wheat germ agglutinin-purified extracts of the nuclei were subjected to PAGE, electrotransfer, and immunoblotting with anti-insulin receptor antibodies. These results suggested that internalized insulin dissociated from its receptor and accumulated in the nucleus without its membrane receptor. We propose that some of insulin's effects on nuclear function may be caused by the translocation of the intact and biologically active hormone to the nucleus and its binding to nuclear components in the heterochromatin.\r"

Twelve-base-pair linker insertion mutations in any of these open reading frames result in a Bvg- phenotype. The predicted protein products of bvgA and bvgC share homology with a family of prokaryotic regulatory proteins that respond to environmental stimuli and are members of two-component sensory transduction systems. We propose a model in which BvgB and the N-terminal portion of BvgC are localized in the periplasm. Environmental signals are recognized, transduced to the cytoplasmic portion of BvgC, and then transmitted to BvgA, a positive regulator of transcription.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of surgical biopsies with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to framework determinants of major histocompatibility complex class I antigens has shown that malignant transformation is frequently associated with a marked loss of these cell surface molecules. The present study sought to determine whether more selective losses of major histocompatibility complex class I expression occur. Multiple specimens from 13 different types of primary and metastatic tumors were tested utilizing mAb BB7.2, which recognizes a polymorphic HLA-A2 epitope. In each case, expression of HLA-A,B,C molecules was determined by testing with mAb W6/32 directed to a framework HLA class I determinant. We have found that in HLA-A2-positive patients (identified by reactivity of their normal tissues with mAb BB7.2), HLA-A2 products are not detectable or are reduced in their expression in 70-80% of endometrial, colorectal, mammary, and renal tumors; in 40-60% of soft-tissue, skin, ovary, urinary bladder, prostate, and stomach tumors; and in 25-30% of melanomas and lung carcinomas tested. All tumors expressed the framework HLA-A,B,C determinant. The HLA-A2 epitope recognized by mAb BB7.2 is located in a portion of the HLA-A2 molecule postulated to react with the T-cell receptor. Immune surveillance to tumors is thought to depend on cytotoxic T cells, which require corecognition of polymorphic HLA class I epitopes, and on natural killer cells, which are, on the contrary, activated by the absence of HLA class I antigens. The selective loss of an HLA class I polymorphic epitope shown in this study may explain the mechanism by which tumor cells escape both T-cell recognition and natural killer cell surveillance.\r"

Isoforms of various molecular masses, 180-240 kDa, are produced by alternative splicing and usage of three exons, named A, B, and C, that encode the N-terminal portion of the external domain. By using monoclonal antibodies that precipitate B exon-dependent and B exon-independent isoforms we find that both murine CD4+ and murine CD8+ T cells selectively down-regulate the B exon-dependent forms of CD45 during an immune response. This change was monitored by using fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis and immunoprecipitation from surface radioiodinated and metabolically labeled cells. The loss of the 190-kDa B exon-dependent isoform during T-cell activation is accompanied by an increased production of a 180-kDa form, which does not contain the B exon-encoded sequence. This accounts for our observation that the overall expression of CD45, as assessed by FACS analysis, does not change.\r"

In experiments on three independently derived simian virus 40-transformed marrow stromal cell lines, the expression of these c-abl transcripts was further increased in response to recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha (1000 units/ml) and interleukin 1 alpha (10 units/ml). Although lymphocyte-conditioned medium predominantly up-regulated the 5-kb transcript, interleukin 1 alpha primarily affected the 6-kb transcript. The up-regulation of the 5-kb c-abl message correlated with up-regulation of the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor transcript and down-regulation of procollagen I transcripts in transformed cells. These data suggest that c-abl plays roles in the regulation of extracellular matrix expression and in the regulation of hematopoietic growth factors by stromal cells.\r"

MR imaging of the knee will likely replace arthrography except in those cases in which cost considerations or availability prevent its implementation.

  ".W": "The diagnosis of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) with ultrasonography (US) is dependent on measurements of pyloric diameter (PD), pyloric length (PL), and muscle thickness. The authors were unable to confidently diagnose the condition with US in 45% of patients who underwent surgery for HPS because all three criteria were not fulfilled. An overall measurement of the \"amount\" of pyloric hypertrophy was introduced: pyloric volume (PV), which was equated to 1/4 pi x PD2 x PL. No overlap was found between patients with HPS (n = 22; PV = 3.13 mL; range, 1.4-5.1 mL) and asymptomatic control subjects (n = 28; PV = 0.65 mL; range, 0.2-1.3 mL) or symptomatic subjects without HPS (n = 25; PV = 0.86 mL; range, 0.4-1.3 mL). A positive correlation was found between age at diagnosis and PV, a finding reflecting that HPS is an acquired condition. In patients less than 4 weeks of age, the criterion of PV greater than or equal to 1.4 mL proved to aid in the identification of early HPS more accurately than any existing criteria.\r"

The patients were 5 weeks, 9 weeks, 3 months, 11 months, and 2 1/2 years old at presentation. The most common presenting complaints were jaundice and abdominal distention (due to ascites). Sonographic findings included ascites in three patients, a loculated fluid collection around the gallbladder in two patients, and both in one patient. The biliary tree was undilated in all patients. Results of hepatobiliary scintigraphy definitely demonstrated that intraperitoneal fluid originated from the biliary tract. Intraoperative cholangiography was used to confirm the diagnosis at surgery. All children were successfully treated with surgery. Recognition of these findings on sonograms and subsequent confirmation with scintigraphy are important to prevent delays in diagnosis of a potentially fatal condition.\r"

Within 24-48 hours after diastolic Doppler shifts returned to normal, diuresis occurred. The Doppler examination enabled prediction of recovery and allowed dialysis treatment to be abbreviated or, in some cases, canceled.\r"

For a diagnosis of DFBD, the patient must fulfill certain stringent requirements: a long-term history of IDDM; radiographically dense glandular tissue; and one or more hard, irregular, easily movable, discrete, painless, palpable breast masses with strong ultrasonographic acoustical shadowing and firm resistance to the back-and-forth motion of the needle used for fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Patients meeting all criteria can be monitored with serial FNAC procedures to prevent them from undergoing multiple surgical biopsies. During an average of 6 years of monitoring these 36 women, breast cancer did not develop in any mass fulfilling all requirements for DFBD.\r"

The lesions were mostly hypoechoic (92%) and homogeneous in echotexture (72%). Twenty-seven percent of fibroadenomas showed irregular margins. Intratumoral calcifications were noted in 10% of lesions. A marked acoustic shadow without associated calcification was seen in six cases. The mean ratio of the length to the anteroposterior diameter of the tumors was 1.84 +/- 0.52 (standard deviation), indicating an elongation along the general orientation of the breast tissue planes. The ratios of length to anteroposterior diameter calculated in two matching groups of small (less than 1 cm3) fibroadenomas and carcinomas differed significantly. State-of-the-art high-frequency transducers, geometric analysis of tumors, and real-time ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy should help to distinguish between benign and malignant solid breast masses.\r"

Multiple, tiny (3-8 mm in diameter), low-intensity spots in the spleen were observed in 21 of 233 patients. Among the imaging studies performed in these 21 patients, the spots were seen on five of 14 T1-weighted images, 11 of 20 proton density images, and 12 of 20 T2-weighted images obtained with spin-echo techniques and on 14 of 14 fast-scan images obtained with gradient-echo rephasing. MR images in the 91 subjects did not show such lesions. MR images of the three spleens resected from patients with portal hypertension showed the low-intensity spots, which corresponded to siderotic nodules found at pathologic analysis. Despite limited pathologic confirmation, siderotic nodules (so-called Gamna-Gandy nodules) are considered the most likely cause of multiple low-intensity spots in the spleen.\r"

In all eight cases, these nodules were most apparent on images obtained with the GRASS (gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state) technique, which is known to be more sensitive to heterogeneity of the magnetic susceptibility, usually caused by hemosiderin deposition. In one of these cases, ultrasonography demonstrated diffuse hyperechoic spots that had been reported to represent Gamna-Gandy bodies of the spleen (ie, organized hemorrhage caused by portal hypertension). Although there was no pathologic proof in their series, the authors believe these low-intensity nodules seen on MR images may represent the hemosiderin deposits of Gamna-Gandy bodies.\r"

Nonunion of right and left intrahepatic bile ducts was identified with sonography in 90% and with CT in 94% of patients. The tumor per se was depicted by sonography in 21% and by CT in 40% of patients. Forty tumors (78%) were of the infiltrating type, seven (14%) were exophytic, and four (8%) were polypoid. With sonography, infiltrating and exophytic tumors were difficult to depict, whereas polypoid tumors were well identified. With CT, infiltrating tumors were more difficult to depict than were exophytic or polypoid tumors. On CT scans, depicted tumors of the infiltrating type showed high attenuation and an indistinct margin, whereas exophytic and polypoid tumors showed low attenuation and a well-defined margin. Sonography and CT were comparably accurate in determining the level of obstruction in hilar cholangiocarcinoma even when no mass was depicted. CT was superior to sonography in depicting tumor per se and in demonstrating associated findings.\r"

Two patients with a complicated abscess were initially treated with ultrasonically (US) guided percutaneous transhepatic gallbladder drainage and then with percutaneous transhepatic aspiration of the liver abscess, followed by an elective operation. A patient with a communicating abscess underwent an elective operation because the abscess completely disappeared after percutaneous transhepatic abscess drainage under US guidance. One of the three patients with an intramural abscess needed an immediate operation, and the other two were treated conservatively, followed by an elective operation. All four patients with an intraperitoneal abscess needed an emergency operation. Because each type of abscess received differing and successful treatments, the authors' method of classification of US findings seemed to provide a useful way to select the specific therapeutic procedure to achieve optimal results.\r"

Renal cell carcinoma was found in 10 patients; angiomyolipoma, three; and segmental renal infarction, arteriovenous malformation (AVM), hemorrhagic cyst, abscess, and idiopathic hemorrhage, one each. Initial CT examinations demonstrated the extent of hemorrhage in all cases and a distinct mass in 12 (67%), with CT characteristics suggestive of the correct diagnosis in 11. In the other six patients (33%), a discrete mass was not seen at initial CT, and in five cause of hemorrhage was not clear. Two of the five underwent follow-up CT, which correctly demonstrated carcinoma in both. Overall, CT findings suggested the correct diagnosis in 14 patients (78%). US was sensitive for detection of an abnormality but nonspecific as to its nature. Angiography demonstrated unsuspected AVM in one patient, segmental renal infarction seen at CT in one, but only one of five carcinomas suspected at CT. Data from this study suggest that CT is the most valuable examination for patients with spontaneous renal hemorrhage.\r"

  ".W": "Since two mullerian defects, the septate and bicornuate uteri, are no longer repaired by means of the same operative approach, an accurate preoperative diagnosis of these anomalies is now critical. A septum can be removed by means of hysteroscopic metroplasty. However, repair of a bicornuate uterus still requires abdominal surgery. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) has been the primary diagnostic modality for mullerian defects. On the basis of 63 patients, HSG findings alone, as interpreted by the radiologist, had a diagnostic accuracy of 55%. When this was supplemented with a gynecologic evaluation, the diagnostic accuracy improved to only 62.5%. However, when a diagnostic protocol that include ultrasound (US) examination with HSG was used for evaluating mullerian defects, the diagnostic accuracy improved to 90%, with all errors being noncritical. Therefore, it is concluded that HSG alone is not adequate to make the distinction between a septate and a bicornuate uterus unless the angle of divergence of two straight uterine cavities is 75 degrees or less, indicating a septate uterus. Luteal-phase US is frequently necessary to distinguish between these anomalies or to diagnose them in combination.\r"

Five hundred responses (68%) were received. In general, significant differences exist across the United States in the mean heparin dose for angiography, mean dose for angioplasty, heparin concentration in flush solutions, and, especially, frequency with which heparin is mixed with nonionic contrast media. Few respondents routinely use systemic (bolus) heparinization for angiography. Heparin concentration in flush solutions varies from 0 IU/L to 12,000 IU/L. Eleven percent of respondents mix heparin with nonionic contrast agents, at a median dose of 5 IU/mL. Results of this survey reveal patterns of practice but do not represent a standard of practice. Protocols for heparin use should be based on experimental evidence, and heparin dosage must be individualized for each procedure and each patient. Large-scale, prospective studies of the merits of systemic heparinization and of mixing heparin with nonionic contrast agents are needed.\r"

Consequently there has been recent interest in noninvasive evaluation. Over a 19-month period, duplex sonography was performed on the renal transplant vasculature in 31 allograft recipients who also underwent correlative arteriography. One patient underwent a repeat duplex study and arteriography after surgical repair. On the basis that a frequency shift greater than 7.5 kHz and associated distal turbulence indicate stenosis, 18 duplex sonographic studies were considered positive. Subsequent angiography showed renal artery stenosis in 16 patients and no significant lesion in two. In 14 patients Doppler studies were interpreted as normal; angiography showed no significant arterial abnormality in 13 and significant stenosis in one. These results indicate a sensitivity of 94.1% and specificity of 86.7% for duplex sonography in the diagnosis of transplant renal artery stenosis. Duplex sonography appears to be an excellent noninvasive screening method to evaluate arterial stenosis following renal transplantation.\r"

On the basis of current knowledge and practice, there is no legal mandate to use these agents. Clear advantages to the use of LOCAs are (a) decreased pain and discomfort in painful examinations (in this regard, however, they are equivalent to dilute HOCAs in intraarterial digital subtraction angiography), (b) decreased myocardial and generalized hemodynamic effects, and (c) decreased osmotic load, perhaps important in infants or severely dehydrated patients. LOCAs may be helpful in examinations of patients with alteration of the blood-brain barrier (major trauma, tumor, or stroke), prior contrast media reactions, and marked anxiety. However, in the following areas, there are, as yet, no clear answers about the use of LOCAs: (a) reduction of overall mortality, (b) reduction of morbidity in elderly patients, and (c) reduction of the risk of nephrotoxicity in patients either with or without specific risk factors such as diabetes mellitus or renal failure.\r"

Phaeohyphomycosis due to X. bantiana occurs worldwide, predominantly in young males. Pharmacologic immunosuppression was not an important predisposing factor. However, four patients had a history of systemic nocardiosis or facial phaeohyphomycosis caused by Alternaria species. Chest radiography revealed no pulmonary infiltrates. Computed tomography of the brain demonstrated a mass defect, the frontal lobes being the most common sites of infection. Lumbar puncture usually demonstrated an elevated opening pressure, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein level, hypoglycorrhachia, and cultures were negative. No preoperative clinical or laboratory features indicated CNS fungal infection. Complete neurosurgical resection of the lesion was the most important therapeutic intervention determining survival; systemic antifungal chemotherapy apparently did not influence outcome. The survival rate of 35% for all patients and of 45% for all neurosurgically treated patients was higher than had previously been reported, probably because patients dying from infections confirmed only histopathologically were excluded.\r"

We conclude that the choice of cephalosporin for the treatment of acute bacterial meningitis should depend mainly on the potency of the agent for the specific meningeal pathogens in question. For the treatment of common meningeal pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis) and for gram-negative bacilli, mainly Escherichia coli and Klebsiella (excluding Pseudomonas aeruginosa), the cefotaxime-ceftriaxone group of cephalosporins has accrued the most clinical experience and the most pharmacokinetic data, while for P. aeruginosa the major interest has centered on ceftazidime.\r"

This review summarizes the information available on in vitro and in vivo activation of neutrophils by recombinant cytokines. The emerging theme is that various cytokines (e.g., colony-stimulating factors, interleukins, tumor necrosis factors, and interferons) have direct and often synergistic abilities that activate the neutrophil to have enhanced cytocidal activity towards microbial and cellular stimuli. Equally important (although less well studied), cytokines have been shown in some cases to enhance the function of neutrophils isolated from immunosuppressed animals. These neutrophils have depressed function, and influences of cytokines on these cells may be different from their influences on normal neutrophils. Only recombinant cytokine data are included in this review because of the potential for contamination of naturally produced cytokines with unknown biologically active substances.\r"

Despite immunosuppression, signs and symptoms of perinephric abscess were prominent and included fever, flank and abdominal pain and tenderness, and abdominal mass. Perinephric abscesses were diagnosed 2 weeks to 52 months after transplantation and were associated with lymphoceles in two patients. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography were useful in diagnosis. Staphylococci (36%) and aerobic gram-negative rods (32%) were the most common pathogens in our seven patients combined with patients identified in a review of the English-language literature.

All presented with the classic manifestations of visceral leishmaniasis, but leishmania serology was negative in 15 patients (93%). Leishmania donovani amastigotes were identified in the bone marrow in all cases. Most patients responded initially to treatment with pentavalent antimonial drugs, but seven (43%) followed a chronic course, with multiple relapses in five, despite alternative treatments. Visceral leishmaniasis occurred in patients with different levels of depression of the CD4 to CD8 lymphocyte ratio. Mortality was 37% (six patients) and was independent of the chronic-relapsing course of the disease. In no case was leishmaniasis the primary cause of death. Our data establish that visceral leishmaniasis is an opportunistic infection in HIV-infected patients, and we suggest that in endemic areas it should be considered an indicator disease for the diagnosis of AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "Numerous drug interactions with the new 4-quinolone antimicrobial agents have now been established. Many, but not all, quinolones are extensively metabolized and can have inhibitory effects on the liver cytochrome P450 enzyme system, leading to reduced metabolism and clearance of certain other drugs that are normally thus eliminated. Examples include the highly significant interaction between enoxacin and theophylline and the interaction between ciprofloxacin and theophylline, which may also be important clinically. The quinolone-caffeine interaction does not usually cause problems. Absorption of all quinolones from the stomach and small intestine is greatly reduced by antacids containing magnesium or aluminium salts, including sucralfate, probably as a result of the formation of nonabsorbable chelates. Cimetidine can reduce the clearance of pefloxacin (but not of ciprofloxacin) through its effects on liver metabolism, although newer H2-inhibitors appear not to have these effects. Probenecid reduces the renal elimination of some quinolones by inhibiting tubular secretion. New evidence is now coming to light of interactions between certain nonsteroid antiinflammatory drugs (e.g., fenbufen), quinolones, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, producing increased cerebral excitation and, sometimes, epileptiform convulsions.\r"

Comparative studies of the young and the elderly are still lacking for pefloxacin. With ofloxacin and norfloxacin, the age-related pharmacokinetic differences seem for the most part to be due to differences in the renal handling of the drugs. With ciprofloxacin and enoxacin more profound differences have been reported. The peak concentrations of ciprofloxacin and enoxacin in serum increase with age, without a concurrent increase in serum half-life. This cannot be explained by differences in the distribution of the drug or by reduced metabolism. The most probable explanation for the age-related differences in the disposition of ciprofloxacin is a more efficient absorption of the drug in the elderly. With enoxacin, an increase in the nonrenal clearance of the drug with age has been demonstrated. The clinical consequence of the age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin and enoxacin is that these antibiotics should be administered at lower doses to the elderly.\r"

Since a similar effect in humans cannot be excluded, the new quinolones are contraindicated in children and pregnant women. Nalidixic acid was the first quinolone developed and was often used in pediatric patients for the treatment of urinary tract infections. This compound is also known to cause damage to juvenile cartilage in animal studies but is still licensed for pediatric use. In three different retrospective studies of children treated with nalidixic acid, no case of quinolone-associated arthropathy could be detected by careful X-ray examinations or comparisons with control patients. This disparity most probably can be explained by interspecies differences: human cartilage may be insensitive or only slightly sensitive to the arthropathic effects of quinolones. Careful prospective evaluations of the efficacy and safety of new quinolones in childhood infections are both medically indicated and ethically justified.\r"

The extent of metabolism can be estimated by determination of the renal and nonrenal clearance of drug and by measurement of excretion of drug labeled with 14C. The principal metabolic pathways of gyrase inhibitors are piperazine ring-based reactions (formation of oxo-compounds, N-oxides, demethylation products where applicable, or ring cleavage with or without subsequent metabolic conversions) and acyl-glucuronidation at the carboxy group of the nucleus. The measurement of metabolites in plasma represents the formation, distribution, and elimination of metabolites in the body. Sensitive techniques have been developed for measuring the penetration of metabolites into fluid and tissue, and studies have been made of the metabolism of gyrase inhibitors in patients with renal failure or hepatic dysfunction. Factors that affect metabolism of gyrase inhibitors include smoking, gender, genetically determined metabolic competency, and dosing schedule.\r"

Moreover, an increasing proportion of Shigella strains of other serotypes isolated in all parts of the world are now resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics. The new fluoroquinolones have been shown to be active against Shigella in vitro and effective for the treatment of shigellosis in adults, but concern about the safety of quinolones has so far prevented the evaluation of these agents for the treatment of shigellosis in young children. Two observations, however, have led a Scientific Working Group of the World Health Organization to suggest that such studies would be appropriate for the following reasons: a one- or two-dose treatment is likely to be effective, and if so the amount of drug given would be far below the doses that have been determined to be toxic in animals; and nalidixic acid, which shares all the toxicity of the fluoroquinolones, is widely recommended--and in some areas routinely used--for the treatment of shigellosis in young children without reports of significant adverse effects. In the Group's view there is an urgent need to perform carefully conducted research to determine the safety and efficacy of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of shigellosis in children.\r"

Resolution of chronic carriage of S. typhi and other salmonellae is difficult, and regimens commonly fail (including those that combine antibiotic administration with removal of the gallbladder). In addition to being active in vitro against Salmonella species, the newer quinolones adequately penetrate the intestinal lumen, liver, bile, and gallbladder. Initial experience with norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in oral treatment of the chronic S. typhi carrier state in adults has been promising.\r"

  ".W": "The rationale for use of quinolones in the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) infections is reviewed. Quinolones exert potent activity in vitro against many gram-negative meningeal pathogens. Given the concentrations attained in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), however, activity against gram-positive organisms is marginal. As a group, the quinolones enter (penetrate) the CSF better than do any other class of antimicrobial agents. The percentage penetration into CSF is remarkably similar in animal models and in humans with meningitis receiving concurrent therapy. The relative rank order for CSF penetration is as follows: enoxacin and pefloxacin (approximately 50%) greater than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin (approximately 20%-30%). Certain quinolones have proven to be equivalent to conventional agents (e.g., third-generation cephalosporins) in the rate with which they eradicate bacterial gram-negative organisms from the CSF in experimental animal models of meningitis, but the serum concentrations have usually been higher than those achieved in humans. Despite these advantages, the concentrations in CSF remain low (e.g., ciprofloxacin, approximately 0.25-0.5 mg/L; pefloxacin, 4-8 mg/L) in humans because of the relatively low concentrations attained in serum. Thus, quinolones will continue to be most useful in the treatment of infections due to problem pathogens or to multiresistant pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas species). Although quinolones appear to enter brain tissue readily, it is unlikely that they can be used as single agents for the treatment of brain abscess because of poor activity against anaerobes and streptococci, and no animal or human studies have been reported. A single dose of ciprofloxacin administered orally appears promising for use in eradication of the meningococcal carrier state.\r"

In fact, the overall clinical success rate of enoxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and ciprofloxacin is greater than 85%, and their efficacy compares favorably with that of other antibiotics. For acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, however, beta-lactam or macrolide agents probably remain a first choice unless sputum reveals gram-negative pathogens; in the same way, drugs other than quinolones seem better indicated in community-acquired pneumonia because of the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in these infections. In contrast, nosocomial pulmonary infections due to gram-negative pathogens should be excellent candidates for therapy with new quinolones. These drugs, used with or without erythromycin and rifampin, might be useful in the treatment of legionnaires' disease.\r"

Several approaches are used for infection prevention. The new oral fluorinated quinolones seem promising for the prevention of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli. Results from different studies showed that these compounds are more efficacious and better tolerated than are other prophylactic regimens. Prophylactic use of quinolones leads to trends in bacteriologically documented infections toward gram-positive microorganisms associated either with the presence of central intravenous catheters (Staphylococcus epidermidis) or with chemotherapy-induced mucositis (alpha-hemolytic streptococci). These changes suggest a need for the inclusion of an antibiotic effective against gram-positive organisms in the initial therapeutic regimen.\r"

The only pharmacokinetic parameters that were consistently distinct in patients with cystic fibrosis vs. normal subjects were a higher maximal concentration of drug in serum and a smaller apparent volume of distribution in patients with cystic fibrosis, a finding that is likely related to a reduced cell mass in cachectic patients. Emergence of resistant strains of P. aeruginosa, with cross-resistance to other fluoroquinolones, has been a fairly common event during the course of therapy. Overall tolerance to the quinolones has been satisfactory. No toxic effect was observed in cartilage during or after therapeutic courses in young children. Consequently, it is urged that indications for the use of fluoroquinolones be broadened to include preadolescent patients.\r"

Quinolones have been effective in the treatment of patients with gram-negative bacterial bone infections and have been as effective as conventional antistaphylococcal therapy in the treatment of osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus.

Adequate surgical drainage and antimicrobial therapy improve the clinical course and reduce the risk of septicemia and local complications. There are only a few studies published to date concerning the use of the new quinolones for surgical prophylaxis and treatment of surgical infections. On the basis of these studies, it can be concluded that surgical infections due to enterobacteria and staphylococci may be successfully treated with the new quinolones.

The efficacy of these agents in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infection, travelers' diarrhea, and infections in neutropenic patients suggests other indications for potential widespread, long-term use. It is therefore important that the tolerability of regimens extending from 3-6 weeks to greater than or equal to 12 months has proved excellent.

The effect on gram-positive bacteria is more variable, with slight to moderate suppression reported most frequently. Total fecal anaerobes have generally been unchanged, although some anaerobic species have been moderately suppressed. The effect on facultative gram-negative bacteria can be explained by high fecal levels of quinolones and very low MICs for most of the organisms. The general lack of effect of anaerobes may be due to the higher MICs and an inoculum effect on the MBCs that is caused by the large number of organisms (10(9)-10(11) colony-forming units/g) characteristically found in feces.\r"

High concentrations inhibit DNA replication, but individual genes are perhaps sensitive to lower concentrations of drug. Inhibition of cell proliferation differs widely among 4-quinolones. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are the most antiproliferative, inhibiting cell growth by approximately 30% at 20 mg/L. Genotoxicity tests with 4-quinolones are probably \"false-positive\" as a result of increased [3H]thymidine uptake that is not related to DNA damage. Ciprofloxacin at greater than or equal to 10 mg/L causes significant strand breaks in DNA, which seemingly are quickly repaired and do not cause mutations or cancer. Production of immunoglobulin is inhibited by ciprofloxacin at a concentration of 5 mg/L, but production of the growth factor interleukin 2 (IL-2) is increased by 4-quinolones at the same concentration and is hyperinduced at higher concentrations. Thus the effects are very contradictory. Increased production of IL-2 may contribute to central nervous system adverse effects. 4-Quinolones in combination with theophylline or antiinflammatory drugs may inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor binding and thereby have adverse effects on the central nervous system. Some 4-quinolones induce crystalluria, which may be nephropathic.\r"

Prescription event monitoring and record linkage are techniques for large, controlled, prospective studies that would be more suitable for monitoring these adverse reactions to quinolones. The response of the pharmaceutical industry to requests for information on ADRs to quinolones is variable, and even when information is made available it is not of sufficient quality for meaningful assessment. All of the current data suggest that quinolones are safe, and marketing departments need to be convinced that a well-defined ADR profile is in their best interests.\r"

Quinolone-resistant alleles of both the gyrA and gyrB genes of DNA gyrase have been sequenced, and domains that affect the action of quinolones have been identified within the amino terminus of the gyrase A peptide and the midportion of the gyrase B peptide. In addition, an ATP-induced structural transition of DNA complexed with DNA gyrase was shown to be blocked by norfloxacin, but the means by which quinolones effect this change and the molecular site of quinolone binding remain unclear. Studies of structure-activity relationships of the quinolone molecule have been expanded and have included effects of quinolones on DNA gyrase. Stereochemical effects at positions 1 and 7 have been found. Substitutions at position 7 that improve potency against gram-positive bacteria have also been identified. Novel mono- and three-ring structures and an isothiazolo substitution at position 3 have broadened the range of structures known to have activity. Studies of bacterial killing by quinolones have revealed additional correlations with markers of DNA damage and additional alterations in bacteria and growth conditions that affect bacterial killing. The exact events responsible for quinolone-mediated lethality, however, remain undefined.\r"

Single-step mutation to high-level resistance occurs at a frequency of less than or equal to 10(-10) for many bacterial species but can be readily selected by serial exposure of cells to increasing drug concentrations. Two mechanisms of resistance have been identified: alteration in the target enzyme DNA gyrase and decreased drug permeation. Emergence of resistance to clinically useful quinolones thus far has been uncommon. Superinfection has been documented but also has been uncommon. Emergence of resistance appears to occur more often with certain bacterial species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In the special setting of cystic fibrosis, patients with P. aeruginosa infections often respond favorably despite emergence of resistance. Methods to minimize the emergence of quinolone resistance should be evaluated in an effort to preserve the clinical utility of these drugs.\r"

(1) Quinolones should be able to penetrate phagocytes; intramacrophagic concentration is highly dependent on serum pharmacokinetics; finally, the best quinolone should have the longest serum half-life and reach highest maximum serum concentrations. (2) The evaluation of antibacterial activity requires an adequate cellular model (e.g., multiplication of Legionella pneumophila within human monocyte-derived macrophages). (3) The prediction of drug efficacy requires an experimental animal model. (4) Clinical trials in human disease are necessary. This stage is difficult when the evaluation concerns severe infectious diseases because the rarity of these diseases makes random clinical trials difficult.

  ".W": "Some of the newer quinolone derivatives (e.g., ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, and amifloxacin) can be administered intravenously. Parenteral quinolone therapy is indicated primarily for patients receiving intensive care or in the early postoperative phase, for perioperative prophylaxis, and for patients with disturbed absorption. With respect to pharmacokinetic parameters, there are no substantial differences between parenteral and oral preparations of the quinolones. The quinolones have a long elimination half-life, a high volume of distribution, low protein-binding capacity, renal as well as extrarenal elimination, and limited biotransformation. Thus far, the limited data concerning the clinical efficacy and safety of quinolones are available only for the parenteral forms of ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin, and ofloxacin. The data available indicate good to excellent clinical and antimicrobiologic responses in patients with complicated urinary tract infections; respiratory tract infections; intraabdominal, bone and joint, skin and soft tissue infections; and difficult-to-treat infections (e.g., septicemia, nosocomial pneumonia, and fever of unknown origin in neutropenic patients).\r"

The morphogenesis of a sheet of polarized epithelial cells (the trophectoderm) is the first overt sign of cellular differentiation in early embryonic development. In the adult, polarized epithelial cells line all body cavities and occur in tissues that carry out specialized vectorial transport functions of absorption and secretion. The generation of this phenotype is a multistage process requiring extracellular cues and the reorganization of proteins in the cytoplasm and on the plasma membrane; once established, the phenotype is maintained by the segregation and retention of specific proteins and lipids in distinct apical and basal-lateral plasma membrane domains.\r"

An alloreactive CD3+CD4-CD8- T cell line specific for murine class II MHC (Ia) antigens encoded in the I-E subregion of the H-2 gene complex was identified, and the primary structure of its gamma delta receptor heterodimer was characterized.

However, the identity, localization, and interplay among the biochemical signals underlying LTP remain unclear. Intracellular microelectrodes have been used to record synaptic potentials and deliver protein kinase inhibitors to postsynaptic CA1 pyramidal cells. Induction of LTP is blocked by intracellular delivery of H-7, a general protein kinase inhibitor, or PKC(19-31), a selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, or CaMKII(273-302), a selective inhibitor of the multifunctional Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). After its establishment, LTP appears unresponsive to postsynaptic H-7, although it remains sensitive to externally applied H-7. Thus both postsynaptic PKC and CaMKII are required for the induction of LTP and a presynaptic protein kinase appears to be necessary for the expression of LTP.\r"

  ".U": "89368923\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of the late genes in bacteriophage T4 development is closely connected to viral DNA replication. Three T4-encoded DNA polymerase accessory proteins are shown to stimulate transcription at T4 late promoters in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis-requiring process. The properties of the activation resemble those found for enhancers of eukaryotic transcription. However, the nature of the enhancer of T4 late transcription is novel in that it is a structure--a break in the nontranscribed DNA stand--to which the three replication proteins bind, rather than a sequence. Since the three DNA polymerase accessory proteins are carried on the moving replication fork as part of the replisome, we postulate that viral DNA replication forks act, in vivo, as the mobile enhancers of T4 late gene transcription. Whereas Escherichia coli RNA polymerase bearing the T4 gene 55 protein can selectively recognize T4 late promoters, it is only capable of responding to the transcription-enhancing activity of the three replication proteins on acquiring an additional T4-specific modification.\r"

Over 14% of clinical cases of uncomplicated Plasmodium vivax malaria at two sites in western Thailand produced sporozoites immunologically distinct from previously characterized examples of the species. Monoclonal antibodies to the CS protein of other P. vivax isolates and to other species of human and simian malarias did not bind to these nonreactive sporozoites, nor did antibodies from monkeys immunized with a candidate vaccine made from the repeat portion of a New World CS protein. The section of the CS protein gene between the conserved regions I and II of a nonreactive isolate contained a nonapeptide repeat, Ala-Asn-Gly-Ala-Gly-Asn-Gln-Pro-Gly, identical at only three amino acid positions with published nonapeptide sequences. This heterogeneity implies that a P. vivax vaccine based on the CS protein repeat of one isolate will not be universally protective.\r"

The His mutant Fv accelerated the hydrolysis of the 7-hydroxycoumarin ester of 5-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-aminopentanoic acid 90,000-fold compared to the reaction with 4-methyl imidazole at pH 6.8 and had an initial rate that was 45 times as great as that for the wild-type Fv. The hydrolyses of aminopropanoic and aminohexanoic homologs were not significantly accelerated. Thus a single deliberate amino acid change can introduce significant catalytic activity into an antibody-combining site, and chemical modification data can be used to locate potential sites for the introduction of catalytic residues.\r"

The c-abl antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited myeloid, but not erythroid, colony formation. The c-abl sense oligodeoxynucleotides and bcr sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were not inhibitory in this assay.

Snoring was reported by 37%, gasping by 8%, excessive daytime somnolence by 36%, and hypertension by 28%; all symptoms were more prevalent in respondents older than 50 years. Snoring and gasping were more common in men than in women. Six persons (1%) had all four risk factors, plus a body mass index of one standard deviation above the mean. Eleven respondents (2%) had all four risk factors, but lower weight.

In our retrospective review of 65 patients with penetrating colon injuries, 33 patients were managed by colostomy formation, 30 were treated by primary repair, and two had exteriorized repair with early return to the abdominal cavity (drop back). The anatomic location of injury was ascending colon in 19 (29%), transverse colon in 20 (31%), descending colon in 22 (34%), and multiple sites in four (6%). The average penetrating abdominal trauma index (PATI) was 24 (ascending colon injuries, 23; transverse colon, 26; descending colon, 24; and multiple colon sites, 28). Overall septic morbidity was 15/65 (23%). Colostomy closure was later done in 32/33 (97%), with a morbidity of 7/32 (22%). The mean length of hospital stay for primary repair was ten days and for colostomy (including both required hospital stays), 26 days (P less than .05). These data suggest that primary repair is as safe as colostomy formation for the management of penetrating colon injuries, regardless of anatomic site of injury.\r"

Little is known about its pathogenesis, but it is believed to be related to the presence of molecular silicone and/or Dacron patches in the pericapsular environment. This condition may mask calcifications of the breast due to carcinoma, and it often exacerbates the symptoms of capsular contracture. We recommend removal of the calcified capsules and replacement of the implants in the submuscular position.\r"

Fourteen of the patients (7.1 per cent) had carcinoma of the colon or rectum at the time of operation; 12 had colitis and two, polyposis. Another 40 patients had mucosal dysplasia. Only five of the 14 patients with carcinoma were diagnosed before operation despite close surveillance by gastroenterologists. The mean duration of colitis before the diagnosis of carcinoma was made was 17 years; the mean age that the carcinoma was identified was 38 years. Eleven of the 12 patients with colitis had universal involvement. Two patients with colitis and carcinoma who underwent colectomy and PTR died a mean of 30.5 months postoperatively of metastatic disease. Twelve patients with carcinoma (ten with colitis and two with polyposis) are alive a mean of 29 months postcolectomy and PTR; two of these have received chemotherapy. The low mortality (0.4 per cent) and good clinical results after colectomy and the PTR procedure and the unexpectedly high incidence of carcinoma and mucosal dysplasia among patients referred for operation suggest that surgical treatment should be considered at an earlier stage than the current general practice, particularly in patients at high risk (mucosal dysplasia, pancolitis and duration of more than ten years).\r"

Patients whose ages were greater than 40 years, the presence of cancer and the administration of an antibiotic for longer than 60 minutes preoperatively were associated with a higher rate of infectious complications. Duration of operation was also related to subsequent infection, ranging from 6 per cent in procedures lasting less than two hours to 27 per cent in operations lasting more than four hours. There was a greater failure of prophylaxis in patients undergoing rectal procedures, with a 29 per cent rate of infectious complications compared with 14 per cent in patients undergoing operations upon the colon.

Reported herein are the results of a retrospective study of 29 patients who underwent potentially curative abdominoperineal resections for ECAC and whose surgical specimens were treated by a clearing technique of the lymph nodes. Five of 16 patients with stage T3 or larger lesions and one patient of 11 with T2 or smaller lesions had LNM (p less than 0.05). Forty-four per cent of the LNM were found in lymph nodes measuring less than 5 millimeters in diameter. Analysis of maps of lymph nodes allowed us to observe that most lymph nodes are located above the peritoneal reflection, that lymph nodes are scant in the perianal zone, that the perirectal zone contains an average of nine lymph nodes and that LNM are most common in the perirectal zone. A lack of association between the size of primary ECAC and LNM is noted, and metastases to small lymph nodes (less than 5 millimeters) are found to be a common occurrence. This may explain previous understaging of patients.\r"

  ".W": "Although individual reports have indicated that a fracture of the first or second rib is predictive of injury to the thoracic aorta and its major branches, the results of a careful review of the literature do not support this contention. In patients suffering blunt trauma, the risk of disruption of the aorta is not greater in patients with fracture of the upper two ribs, compared with victims of trauma with fracture of other ribs or those without fracture of ribs. Clinical manifestations are often absent in patients with disruption of the aorta or the innominate artery, but evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage is almost always present on roentgenograms of the chest. Widening of the mediastinum may not be apparent, but obliteration of the normal aortic contour is a sensitive finding in aortic transection. Injury to the subclavian or carotid artery nearly always produces clinical or roentgenographic signs, or both. After blunt trauma to the chest, patients with fracture of the first or second rib without clinical signs of vascular injury and evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage on thoracic roentgenograms (with the patient in an upright position when possible) do not need aortography to exclude occult vascular injury. A few patients with injury to the great vessels may have a normal thoracic roentgenogram on initial presentation to the hospital. After the correction of hypovolemia and stabilization of hemodynamic status, evidence of mediastinal bleeding should become apparent on subsequent thoracic roentgenograms. Repeat examinations must be performed and serial roentgenograms of the chest must be obtained for several days after injury to assess the possibility of unrecognized vascular trauma. If clinical or roentgenographic evidence of vascular injury is revealed, arteriography is mandatory. Thoracic CT scanning in patients with evidence of mediastinal hemorrhage on plain film may be of value in selecting patients for angiography, but additional experience must be obtained before such a protocol becomes an established policy.\r"

On the basis of the results of experimental investigations, technical recommendations are made regarding the performance of embolectomy in patients. Attention to these technical details will prevent excessive shear forces and should decrease the incidence of catheter-induced vascular injuries. The following are recommended for performance of balloon embolectomy in patients: 1. Select smallest-sized catheter that will be effective. 2. Use small-bore, long-stroke syringe, such as tuberculin syringe. 3. Whenever possible, fill embolectomy balloons with fluid; air may be preferable in 2F catheters. 4. Before insertion into vessel, fill balloon to check for leaks and for eccentricity. 5. Reject balloons that leak or are markedly eccentric. 6. Insert catheter into vessel, taking care to enter true lumen; do not create false passage. 7. Do not force catheter against resistance: this may cause arterial perforation. 8. Begin to withdraw catheter before balloon is inflated; within first centimeter of motion, inflate balloon. 9. Withdraw catheter slowly and, if possible, continuously. 10. Repeat until lumen is clear, but do not pass catheter excessive number of times. 11. Obtain intraoperative completion arteriogram.\r"

In five dogs that had undergone gastric vagotomy and Roux gastrectomy and five dogs that had undergone gastric vagotomy and Billroth I gastrectomy (controls), myoelectric activity of the Roux limb or duodenum was recorded during saline infusion (154 mmol/L NaCl) or nutrient (Meritene) infusion into the limb or the duodenum. Reflux of infusate into the stomach was determined via a gastric cannula. Tests in Roux dogs were done with and without limb pacing. Roux dogs showed ectopic pacemakers in the Roux limb that drove the pacesetter potentials of the limb in a reverse, or orad, direction during 76% of the recordings; Billroth dogs rarely had such pacemakers (p less than 0.001). Enterogastric reflux occurred in both groups of dogs but was greater during phase III of the interdigestive migrating myoelectric complex in Roux dogs (12% +/- 6%) than in Billroth dogs (3% +/- 1%; p less than 0.05). Pacing abolished the ectopic pacemakers in the Roux dogs and reduced enterogastric reflux from 12% +/- 6% to 3% +/- 2% when phase III was present (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, the Roux limb was driven by ectopic pacemakers that contributed to, but were not solely responsible for, jejunogastric reflux. Pacing abolished the ectopic pacemakers and decreased reflux when phase III was present in the limb.\r"

The biochemical changes were related to the cause of the disease and to the clinical course. Protease activation and protease inhibitor consumption were most pronounced in the peritoneal fluid, especially in bacterial peritonitis. Plasma changes also indicated activation of the complement, kinin, and fibrinolytic systems and protease inhibitor consumption, especially of alpha 2-macroglobulin and antithrombin III. There was no significant difference between chemical and bacterial peritonitis regarding these plasma changes. Immunohistologic studies showed evidence of active uptake of protease-antiprotease complexes in macrophage-like cells in the peritoneum in both groups. It is concluded that peritonitis results in protease activation and protease inhibitor consumption, especially in the peritoneal fluid. The peritoneum has an active role in the clearance of protease-antiprotease complexes. The intensity, not the type, of the intra-abdominal challenge determines the biochemical changes in peritonitis.\r"

Ten episodes of pneumonitis associated with cytomegalovirus and nine episodes due to various other infectious and non-infectious causes were investigated in 16 patients (three patients had two episodes of pneumonitis). Total lavage cell counts and differential cell counts were determined and compared with results from normal control subjects. In most patients with pneumonitis the total cell yield was greater than normal (mean 6.8 (SD 6.0) x 10(5) cells/ml; normal 1-2 x 10(5) cells/ml). The percentage distribution of these cells was 71.9 (17) macrophage like cells, 24.1 (15.8) lymphocytes, 5.0 (5.0) polymorphonuclear cells, and 0.7 (1.0) eosinophils. None of the patients had peripheral lymphocytosis despite the increased number of lymphocytes in the lavage fluid. Further analysis of the lymphocyte population using monoclonal antibodies with immunocytochemical techniques showed that B cells were generally present in normal proportions, whereas the proportion of cells expressing T lymphocyte markers (CD2+, CD5+, CD8) were reduced in nine out of 19 cases. In 10 of the 19 episodes there were substantial numbers of cells expressing none of the B or T cell antigens studied (\"null\" cells). These abnormalities bore no relation to survival. The total cell yield, the proportion and number of lymphocytes, and the proportion and number of T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were all lower in the group with cytomegalovirus infections than in those with pneumonitis from other causes. These results suggest that the pneumonitis in recipients of bone marrow transplants is associated with a local immune response despite the fact that the individuals are otherwise immunosuppressed.\r"

Two sex- and age-matched white patients with transient ischemic attacks were similarly studied for each black patient. Extent of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis (expressed as B-mode score) was similar for blacks and whites. B-mode score was only slightly less in patients with posterior- than in those with anterior-circulation transient ischemic attacks. Fifty-six patients (35 white, 21 black) had unilateral anterior-circulation transient ischemic attacks. Of the 32 patients with more extensive extracranial carotid atherosclerosis ipsilateral to the affected hemisphere, 23 (66% of 35) were white; only nine (43% of 21) were black. In the 35 white patients, the extent of disease in the ipsilateral carotid artery was significantly greater (p less than 0.03) than that in the contralateral carotid artery. When B-mode scores in the left and right carotid arteries were combined for the subgroup of patients with unilateral anterior-circulation transient ischemic attacks, blacks had slightly more atherosclerosis in the extracranial arteries than whites.\r"

Intention-to-treat analysis failed to show any differences in neurologic deficit, mortality, or neurologic disability among the groups. Efficacy analysis showed a significantly higher degree of neurologic improvement in GM1 group patients compared with patients in the P group during the first 15 days. GM1-treated patients (GM1 and GM1 + H groups) showed a significantly higher degree of neurologic improvement during the first 10 days compared with the placebo-treated patients (P and P + H groups).

Fludrocortisone significantly reduced the frequency of a negative sodium balance during the first 6 days (from 63% to 38%, p = 0.041). A negative sodium balance was significantly correlated with decreased plasma volume during both the first 6 days (p = 0.014) and during the entire 12-day study period (p = 0.004). Although fludrocortisone treatment tended to diminish the decrease in plasma volume, the difference was not significant (p = 0.188). More patients in the control group developed cerebral ischemia (31% vs. 22%) and, consequently, more control patients were treated with plasma volume expanders (24% vs. 15%), which may have masked the effects of fludrocortisone on plasma volume. Fludrocortisone therefore reduces natriuresis and remains of possible therapeutic benefit in the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

Twenty-two rabbits underwent 1-hour occlusion of the left internal carotid and anterior cerebral arteries followed by 4.5 hours of reperfusion before sacrifice. One hour after the onset of ischemia, immediately after removing the arterial clips, the rabbits were blindly assigned to treatment with dextromethorphan (20 mg/kg i.v. loading dose followed by 10 mg/kg/hr maintenance infusion, n = 7), dextrorphan (15 mg/kg i.v. loading dose followed by 15 mg/kg/hr maintenance infusion, n = 7), or an equivalent volume of normal saline alone (n = 8). The maintenance infusion of drugs or saline was continued for the duration of the experiment. The formalin-fixed brains were analyzed with magnetic resonance imaging using coronal T2-weighted images, and ischemic neuronal damage was assessed on standard coronal hematoxylin-and- eosin-stained sections. The area of neocortical ischemic neuronal damage was significantly reduced in the groups treated with dextromethorphan (4.2%, p less than 0.01) and dextrorphan (6.1%, p less than 0.01) compared with the controls (36.2%). Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated significantly smaller areas of cortical edema in the groups treated with dextromethorphan (14.6%, p less than 0.01) and dextrorphan (8.0%, p less than 0.01) compared with the controls (32.9%). These clinically tested antitussives with NMDA-antagonist properties may have therapeutic value in the treatment of human cerebrovascular disease.\r"

Magnesium may also antagonize the increase in intracellular calcium concentration caused by ischemia and thus prevent cell damage and death. Magnesium might have a role in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm and ischemia, such as occurs in subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, and brain trauma.\r"

Collections were made in the four metropolitan areas with the highest prevalence of AIDS. Retrospective testing showed an overall anti-HIV-1 prevalence of 16 cases per 10,000 donations. In this study, the predictive value of a negative initial enzyme-linked immunoassay was estimated from both quality control specimens and the rescreening of 13,461 sera to be greater than 99.99 percent with respect to technical error. Among anti-HIV-1-positive persons, there was a 1.3- to 1.5-fold excess of first-time donors. The anti-HIV-1 prevalence among donors showed that infection was more common among young men than suggested by national reporting of AIDS cases. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence varied among the four metropolitan areas less than did reported AIDS cases, but, by 1987, the differences in the latter had decreased. Anti-HIV-1 prevalence in collection areas outside of the four major cities differed much more widely than that among the cities themselves. The TSS/NHLBI Donor Repository will remain available for the indefinite future for further evaluation of screening procedures for HIV-1 and other viruses for which transfusion is found to be an important route of transmission.\r"

Because patients could be randomized to receive sham plasma exchange and placebo medications, it was decided when the trial was designed that the use of fistulae, arteriovenous shunts, venous cutdowns, or other aggressive forms of venous access would not be permitted for any patient. Accordingly, patients judged to have inadequate superficial antecubital veins were ineligible for the trial. To date, only 13 (4.4%) of 294 patients considered for entry into the trial have been rejected on these grounds. In only 4 of the 93 patients undergoing exchange was it necessary to discontinue plasma exchange because of inadequate venous access. In 79.3 percent of the 1207 exchanges done in these patients, there were no problems of any kind with venous access. In 5.4 percent of these 1207 exchanges, it was necessary to terminate the procedure prematurely because of difficulties with patients' veins. Thus, the great majority of patients free of serious systemic illness (other than chronic progressive multiple sclerosis) can undergo weekly plasma exchange for up to 20 weeks using superficial antecubital veins without the need to resort to more invasive methods of venous access.\r"

There are three stages of the clinical course of Lyme borreliosis; however, not all those infected will have typical manifestations of each stage, such as the arthritis of the third stage. Routine blood cultures will rarely document bacteremia and serologic testing is not yet reliable. Early treatment can prevent later stages of Lyme borreliosis. There is evidence that transmission of B. burgdorferi by blood transfusion is possible, but, to date, there has been no documentation of transfusion-associated Lyme borreliosis. Thus, no new recommendations for screening donors to identify possible carriers of B. burgdorferi are suggested at this time.\r"

As expected, a diurnal rhythm was seen in adults. A diurnal rhythm was also found for cortisol and endorphin levels in neonates (3 to 4 days postnatally) with minimal stress and in infants who were clinically severely stressed. There was not a significant difference between the morning and afternoon concentrations of ACTH in these infants, but the afternoon concentrations were lower than the morning's, as would be expected. We found that a diurnal rhythm does exist in neonates within the first few days of postnatal life and that the continuous lighting and medical and nursing interventions do not interfere with this rhythm.\r"

Patients with active disease fare worse than those with inactive disease. There is little evidence that pregnancy affects the course of inflammatory bowel disease or that inactive inflammatory bowel disease affects the course of pregnancy. Judicious medical therapy is effective in controlling inflammatory bowel disease during pregnancy. Sulfasalazine or steroid therapy should not be withdrawn in a patient who needs it to achieve or maintain a quiescent state of inflammatory bowel disease during the course of pregnancy. Immunosuppressive therapy should be avoided. Aggressive medical therapy with total parenteral nutrition in a team approach with a gastroenterologist, surgeon, and perinatologist usually avoids the need for surgical intervention during pregnancy with a good fetal outcome in a patient whose disease is active. Contraception against pregnancy need only be considered in those patients whose disease is so severe that operative therapy is imminent.\r"

  ".W": "Health insurance in the United States is failing patients and physicians alike. In this country 37 million uninsured face economic barriers to care, and the health of many suffers as a result. The \"corporatization\" of medical care threatens professional values with an unprecedented administrative and commercial intrusion into the daily practice of medicine. Competitive strategies have also failed their most ostensible goal--cost control. In contrast, Canada offers a model of a national health insurance plan that provides universal and comprehensive coverage, succeeds at restraining health care inflation, and does little to abrogate the clinical autonomy of physicians in private practice. I propose that American physicians relent in their historical opposition to national health insurance and participate in the development of a universal, public insurance plan responsive to the needs of both patients and physicians.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred six patients with suspected appendicitis were examined with sonography over a 6-month period in three community teaching hospitals. Of 41 patients in whom the surgeons judged the clinical findings severe enough to warrant immediate surgery (group A), 34 (83%) had appendicitis, and sonography had a sensitivity of 0.76, a specificity of 0.71, and an accuracy of 0.76. Of 165 patients in whom the surgeons judged the clinical findings severe enough to warrant hospitalization for observation but not immediate surgery (group B), 51 (31%) had appendicitis at subsequent surgery. Sonography had a sensitivity of 0.96, a specificity of 0.94, and an accuracy of 0.95. Of 49 surgeons surveyed, the mean testing threshold (i.e., the probability of appendicitis below which they would send the patient home without further tests or observation) was 0.11, and the mean treatment threshold (i.e., the probability of appendicitis above which they would operate immediately) was 0.82. The posttest probability of appendicitis with findings indicating appendicitis present on sonography was 0.93 in group A and 0.88 in group B, and with findings absent on sonography it was 0.62 in group A and 0.02 in group B. We conclude that in group A patients, the use of sonography remains controversial in the diagnosis of appendicitis, but in group B patients it is both valid and useful.\r"

  ".W": "Cine MR imaging is a new technique that combines short repetition times, limited flip angles, gradient-refocused echoes, and cardiac gating. This procedure was performed in 20 patients in whom mitral regurgitation was shown on left ventriculography, and the results were compared with those of color Doppler flow mapping. In all cases, mitral regurgitation on cine MR imaging was depicted as an area of decreased signal intensity within the left atrium. The extent and severity of the regurgitant jet as seen by the two techniques were classified visually as 4+ (severe), 3+ (moderate), 2+ (mild), and 1+ (minimal). The results of the two methods were the same in 14 (70%) of the 20 patients. In five patients the results differed by one grade and in one patient by two grades. In addition, the maximal intrusion distance and area of the regurgitant jet divided by the area of the left atrium as determined by the two methods were compared. The correlation coefficients between the two methods in regard to the length and area of mitral regurgitation were .74 and .71, respectively. These data suggest that the accuracy of cine MR imaging in assessing the severity of mitral regurgitation is comparable to that of color Doppler flow imaging.\r"

Sonograms were obtained in the right lateral decubitus position to allow gastric fluid to accumulate in the antrum, where it was quantified by measuring the maximal cross-sectional area of antral fluid in square centimeters. Sonograms revealed no fluid or a small amount (less than 5 cm2) in 87 (61%) of the patients and a large amount of fluid (greater than or equal to 5 cm2) in 56 patients (39%). Barium examinations showed a duodenal ulcer in 26 (46%) of the 56 patients with sonographic evidence of a large amount of gastric fluid compared with 10 patients (11%) in the group with little or no fluid on sonography (p = .001). Sonographic evidence of a large amount of fluid was found in all five patients who had gastric-outlet obstruction on barium examination (p = .02). The detection of a large amount of fluid in the stomach on sonography appears to be a feature of duodenal ulcer disease and gastric-outlet obstruction.\r"

In a retrospective study, the sensitivity of both the small-bowel enema and the conventional small-bowel follow-through examination were compared on the basis of the original radiologic interpretation. The studies were ordered by clinicians in a clinical setting. Results of the small-bowel follow-through were abnormal in 11 of 18 patients for a sensitivity of 61%, and small-bowel enema showed abnormalities in 19 of 20 patients for a sensitivity of 95% (p = .0165). The actual tumor was shown in six (33%) of 18 small-bowel follow-through studies and in 18 (90%) of 20 small-bowel enemas (p = .0005). In four patients, normal findings on conventional small-bowel follow-through were followed by abnormal findings on small-bowel enema done for the same reason. This experience suggests that the small-bowel enema is more sensitive than the conventional follow-through examination for the detection of small-bowel cancers.\r"

Before the chemotherapy, all patients had normal hepatic arterial perfusion. Arterial perfusion abnormalities were detected in 30 patients (60%) after 6 months of chemotherapy and in 41 patients (82%) after chemotherapy for 1 year. After 6 months of chemotherapy, 36% of the regressive and 39% of the progressive metastases were located in areas with arterial perfusion abnormalities. After 1 year of chemotherapy, 54% of the regressive and 60% of the progressive metastases were situated in portions of the liver with perfusion abnormalities. Hepatic arterial perfusion abnormalities were found to be progressive during intraarterial infusion chemotherapy. No relationship between arterial perfusion abnormalities and tumor response to chemotherapy could be detected.\r"

Detection of these complications with incremental dynamic CT and detection with sonography were compared prospectively in 41 patients (79 kidneys) who had been undergoing dialysis intermittently for 3 or more years. Acquired cystic kidney disease (five or more cysts per kidney) was identified in 59% of kidneys by use of CT and in 18% by use of sonography. CT showed a complete renal contour definition in all cases, sonography did so in only 57%. Three solid renal tumors (2- to 4-cm diameter) were identified with both techniques with no false-negative evaluations. Four benign hemorrhagic cysts were identified with combined CT (hyperdense mass) and sonography (benign cysts). CT provided the best anatomic image quality and was more accurate for detection of acquired cystic kidney disease. CT and sonography were equivalent for detection of solid tumors. Our results suggest that dynamic contrast-enhanced CT scanning with the supplemental use of sonography is the best imaging regimen for the evaluation of suspected acquired cystic kidney disease and its potential complications.\r"

We reviewed seven surgically proved cases in which the pars infravaginalis gubernaculi was mistaken for an undescended testis on imaging studies. The studies included sonography (five cases), CT (two cases), and MR imaging (two cases). Identification of the mediastinum testis on sonograms or MR images confirms that a structure is testis and not the pars infravaginalis gubernaculi. In two of these patients, testicular venography was used to further identify the undescended testis. In these two patients, the pampiniform plexus, which is used to identify the presence and position of testis, was located adjacent to the pars infravaginalis gubernaculi. Our experience indicates that the pars infravaginalis gubernaculi can be similar in appearance to the undescended testis on any imaging study. The finding of an apparent cord leading to a testislike structure on caudad sectional imaging does not obviate searching for the testis as far as the renal hila.\r"

Patients with fetal malformations, incorrect dates, twins, or lack of follow-up were excluded. Overall, 27 (36%) of 76 patients with elevated MS-AFP levels had placental or amniotic fluid abnormalities compared with only three (3%) of 87 control subjects. Significant differences (p less than .01) were noted in the frequency of periplacental hemorrhage (9% vs 0%), intraplacental sonolucencies greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in diameter (18% vs 3%) and moderate or severe oligohydramnios (17% vs 0%). More patients with elevated MS-AFP levels had placenta previa (4%) or placental thickness greater than or equal to 3.5 cm (12%) than did those in the control group (1% and 5%, respectively), although these differences did not reach statistical significance. Seven (26%) of the 27 patients had more than one abnormality. We conclude that placental and/or amniotic fluid abnormalities are frequently shown on sonograms in women who are examined because of elevated MS-AFP levels.\r"

In no case did the shelf attach to the fetus or restrict fetal motion. The fetus was sonographically normal in 23 pregnancies, and no fetus developed amniotic-band syndrome. One fetus had anencephaly, probably unrelated to amniotic-band syndrome. Although these shelves may be due to synechiae, only eight (32%) of the patients had a history of dilatation and curettage or cesarean delivery, which predispose the patient to formation of synechiae. This experience suggests that when a shelf of tissue with a free edge is present within the pregnant uterus, there should be no concern for the development of amniotic-band syndrome as long as a complete sonographic survey of the fetus reveals no abnormalities.\r"

It is also important for physicians to understand their own anxieties and emotions.

An additional concern, endometrial carcinoma, appears to be largely alleviated by coadministration of progestin. Evidence indicates that concomitant progestin administration actually reduces the incidence of endometrial carcinoma to less than that in untreated women. An incidental but potentially more important benefit is protection against coronary artery disease. Optimal management includes initiation of estrogen therapy shortly after menopause, long-term continuation and calcium supplementation.\r"

Using two-dimensional Doppler echocardiography and arterial blood pressure recordings, we evaluated the changes that occur during coughing in nine patients who were dependent on pacemakers and in whom periods of asystole could be induced. During asystole in each patient the mitral valve stayed partially open and the left ventricular area comprised 87% and 90% (apical four-chamber view, short-axis view, respectively) of the area during diastole of paced rhythm. Peak arterial pressure during coughing and asystole was 80% of peak systolic pressure of paced rhythm (P = 0.001). Left ventricular area during coughing was 110% (both apical four-chamber view and short-axis views) of the area during asystole when patients were not coughing. Both the mitral and aortic valves showed no appreciable motion during coughing. During coughing the mean flow velocity across the mitral valve was 0.06 +/- 0.03 m/sec and the flow velocity integral was 0.03 +/- 0.02 cm. Thus coughing during asystole produced minimal flow despite a rise in brachial arterial pressure.\r"

Effects on exercise testing showed a more pronounced training bradycardia and a remarkable improvement in ST abnormalities in treatment A (p less than 0.005). A model was developed to integrate the various exercise parameters into a single measure for training benefit. Approximately half the patients showed a training success, with a more positive and less negative outcome in treatment A (p = 0.09). The odds for failure were 0.25 for treatment A and 0.51 for treatment B (odds ratio: 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.94 to 4.6). Thus the risk of failure was reduced by half when relaxation was added to exercise training. These results indicate that exercise training is not successful in all MI patients and that relaxation therapy enhances training benefit.\r"

  ".W": "MAT is an uncommon arrhythmia most often seen in elderly patients with chronic pulmonary disease who are critically ill due to acute respiratory or cardiac decompensation. Its importance lies in the fact that it is commonly mistaken for AF, since both disorders are characterized by narrow ventricular complexes, irregular rates, and (depending on the ECG lead observed in MAT) by an apparent lack of P wave activity. This may lead to treatment with digoxin, a drug known to be ineffective in the therapy of MAT, with the potential for producing toxicity in patients who are predisposed. The incidence of MAT in hospitalized patients in various studies ranges from 0.13% to 0.40%. The mechanism of the arrhythmia is thought to be triggered activity arising from increased intracellular calcium stores that may be produced by hypokalemia, hypoxia, acidemia, and increased catecholamines, characteristics commonly found in patients with MAT. COPD, coronary artery disease, CHF, and infection (both pulmonary and nonpulmonary) are the most common clinical settings of MAT. Mortality is very high in all patients studied, ranging from 38% to 62%, and is due to their underlying disease processes and not to the arrhythmia. The need for intubation and mechanically assisted ventilation portends a particularly poor prognosis for survival. Treatment should initially consist of correction of the precipitating causes, as it is common for patients to convert to sinus rhythm both spontaneously and after these measures are taken.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It has been apparent for more than 25 years that the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are markedly activated in the late stages of heart failure. These two systems interact to facilitate sympathetic drive and promote salt and water retention. Circumstantial evidence is now accumulating to indicate that excessive sympathetic drive and angiotensin II activity may contribute to the pathophysiology of heart failure. These observations suggest that a dual strategy of modulating sympathetic nervous system activity to the heart while blocking angiotensin II activity may provide a rational therapeutic approach to the treatment of heart failure. Xamoterol, a beta 1 partial agonist, may enhance myocardial contractile force in the steady state, while acting to inhibit excessive sympathetic drive during exercise or severe heart failure. The concomitant use of a converting-enzyme inhibitor would be expected to blunt the detrimental effects of excessive angiotensin II activity. Modulation of adrenergic drive coupled with inhibition of marked angiotensin II activity may be potentially more effective in the treatment of congestive heart failure than either strategy used alone.\r"

To further define the coronary vascular reactivity of human heart transplant, coronary sinus blood flow and coronary resistance were measured before and after intravenous dipyridamole within the first year after transplantation in 8 patients without rejection (group II) and in 5 patients with rejection (group III). All had normal coronary arteriograms. Results were compared to those of 8 control subjects (group I). After dipyridamole, coronary sinus blood flow was increased in groups I, II and III by 303, 212 (p less than 0.01 vs group I) and 45%, respectively (p less than 0.001 vs groups I and II). Coronary resistance was reduced by 77, 73 (not significant vs group I) and 36%, respectively (p less than 0.001 vs groups I and II). Concomitantly, coronary sinus blood oxygen content was increased by 172, 145 (not significant vs group I) and 78%, respectively (p less than 0.001 vs group I, not significant vs group II). Thus, the coronary flow reserve evaluated by the dipyridamole/basal coronary sinus blood flow ratio and the coronary resistance reserve evaluated by the basal/dipyridamole coronary resistance ratio were dramatically impaired in group III (1.56 +/- 0.09 and 1.63 +/- 0.30, respectively, p less than 0.001 vs groups I and II). In contrast, they were almost normal in group II (3.11 +/- 0.42 vs 4.03 +/- 0.52 in group I, p less than 0.02, and 3.83 +/- 0.78 vs 4.45 +/- 0.81 in group I, difference not significant). Thus, the impairment of coronary reserve during heart rejection should be linked to abnormalities of the coronary microvaculature. This emphasizes the important involvement of the coronary circulation in the rejection process.\r"

Accordingly, this study was designed to examine the factors that may be in part responsible for aging's effect on the pattern of LV diastolic filling. The LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relation was analyzed in 11 elderly subjects (68 +/- 5 years, mean +/- standard deviation) and 15 normal young adults (31 +/- 7 years) without coronary artery disease, systemic hypertension, LV hypertrophy or abnormality of LV systolic function. After catheterization, the subjects underwent pulsed Doppler analysis of mitral flow. All had normal 2-dimensional echocardiograms without LV or valvular dysfunction. Peak early filling velocity in the elderly subjects was decreased in comparison with that in young adults (61 +/- 14 vs 83 +/- 8 cm/s, p less than 0.001) and the ratio of early and late diastolic filling velocity was reduced (0.81 +/- 0.26 vs 1.88 +/- 0.40, p less than 0.001). The isovolumic relaxation time did not differ between the elderly and young subjects (158 +/- 20 vs 146 +/- 22 ms, difference not significant). In the elderly, LV end-diastolic pressure was increased (15 +/- 7 vs 11 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) despite a smaller end-diastolic volume index (60 +/- 16 vs 74 +/- 18 ml/m2, p less than 0.05), indicating a shift of the passive diastolic pressure-volume relation. It was concluded that early diastolic filling is reduced in normal aged subjects, even in the absence of coronary artery disease and systolic dysfunction. This altered pattern of diastolic filling may result from a shift of the passive LV diastolic pressure-volume relation.\r"

A unique pattern of concentric fibrointimal thickening develops within 1 year of cardiac transplantation; however, it is relatively inapparent on routine arteriography. The disease progresses primarily in distal vasculature, leading to progressive occlusion. Angiographically discrete lesions associated microscopically with advanced atherosclerotic plaques frequently occur in the more proximal vessels often associated with thrombus. The number of rejection episodes is somewhat predictive of the development of transplant coronary disease. Annual arteriograms performed in cardiac transplant recipients have revealed several distinctive angiographic features that include clockwise rotation of the heart, presence of coronary arterial-cameral fistulae, presumably resulting from right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy specimens and collateralization of the brachial anastomosis from coronary atrial branches. It is concluded that serial angiography in cardiac transplant recipients is important in the early detection of progressive graft atherosclerosis, a process that is clinically silent until such time as overt heart failure or cardiogenic shock occurs.\r"

Based on reported studies, the incidence of contrast associated nephropathy (CAN) varies from 0 to 22%. This wide variation can be traced to differences in study design and the criteria used to designate significant renal impairment. Irrespective of the exact incidence, 2 defined risk factors have been identified: preexisting renal disease and diabetes mellitus. Whereas preexisting renal insufficiency is the single most influential risk factor for CAN, when diabetes coexists the incidence approaches 100%. The clinical presentation of CAN is distinct, having a temporal relation between the performance of the contrast study in the high-risk patient and the onset of an increase in serum creatinine levels within the next 24 hours. Serum creatinine values greater than 50% of baseline or rising 1 mg/dl or more is diagnostic. The peak serum creatinine level occurs within 3 to 5 days of the contrast study and oliguria is associated in approximately 30% of the cases. Monitoring serum creatinine is the most useful clinical procedure in high-risk patients after angiography. At least 5 potential pathophysiologic mechanisms of CAN have been proposed: interference with renal perfusion, altered glomerular perm-selectivity, direct tubular injury, intraluminal obstruction, and immunologic mechanisms. Support for each mechanism, either singularly or in combination, can be found in published reports; however, none has achieved universal acceptance. The single most important clinical axiom regarding the prevention and management of CAN is, \"Always use the least invasive diagnostic procedure available.\"(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Likewise, during and after the procedure similar angiographic assessment is important to determine resultant lesion morphology, branch anatomy, distal runoff, and adequacy of lesion dilatation. Thus, the outcome of angioplasty is dependent on the operator's ability to opacify the coronary arteries with minimal or no vessel/lesion overlap or foreshortening. Although coronary angiography has become more routine for many angiographers with the advent of angioplasty, the importance of high-quality angiography continues to be a major component for successful angioplasty.\r"

  ".W": "Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has great potential for defining noninvasively the metabolic status of the heart and skeletal muscle. This technique uses the spin properties of certain nuclei (such as phosphorus-31, hydrogen-1 and carbon-13) to measure high energy phosphates, intracellular pH, lactate and glycogen. Animal studies have formed the basis for human investigations and have demonstrated well-defined changes in high energy phosphates during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, as well as in cardiomyopathies. Human studies have been limited by issues of sensitivity and localization, although techniques such as rotating frame, depth-resolved surface coil spectroscopy, image-selected in vivo spectroscopy and spectroscopic imaging have been used to acquire phosphorus-31 spectra from the human heart. The few human studies of patients with disease have demonstrated elevated inorganic phosphate peaks after myocardial infarction and abnormal phosphodiester peaks in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Studies of patients with heart failure have shown that these patients acidify their peripheral muscles with exercise more easily than do control subjects. Clinical application of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy will depend on technical advances and the demonstration of sensitivity of metabolic changes with disease.\r"

In myocardial ischemia, PET identifies the presence and extent of viability in dysfunctional myocardium and distinguishes it from irreversible ischemic injury and scar tissue formation. Because metabolic markers have proved more accurate and reliable for identifying viability than conventional diagnostic approaches, PET has become increasingly useful for characterizing the severity and extent of an ischemic injury and for assigning patients with acute or chronic coronary artery disease to the most efficacious treatment.\r"

  ".U": "89371528\r", 
  ".W": "Ultrafast computer tomography (CT) is one of the major new imaging modalities that has become available for the evaluation of patients with heart disease. With cine CT it is possible to obtain high resolution images of the heart at 58-ms intervals. The inplane resolution is 0.7 to 1.5 mm, and the slice thickness is 3 to 9 mm. Images require the intravenous injection of nonionic contrast agents to obtain quantitative information about cardiac function. Cine CT has thus far been used in 3 general areas that relate to the evaluation of patients with heart disease: evaluation of cardiac structure and function, evaluation of vein bypass graft patency and flow reserve, and measurements of regional myocardial perfusion. Because of the outstanding spatial resolution of the images, it is possible to obtain very precise information about cardiac structure and function. The weight of the left ventricle and right ventricular walls can be measured to +/- 5%, and the stroke volumes and end-diastolic volumes of all 4 cardiac chambers can also be measured with an accuracy of +/- 5%. With this technology it is possible to determine the magnitude of aortic regurgitation within +/- 5 to 8%. This modality has also proved useful in the diagnosis of surgically resectable left ventricular aneurysm and a multitude of other cardiac disorders that involve abnormalities in cardiac structure, including congenital heart defects, aortic aneurysms and constrictive pericarditis. These diagnostic procedures use the peripheral injection of usually about 100 ml of contrast media and can ordinarily be completed in less than 15 minutes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Retinol-binding protein in serum is also lower in the premature infant population. The parenteral retinol supplementation frequently required for these infants has only recently become adequate by the finding of methods to avoid large losses of retinol onto intravenous tubing. Retinol is an essential vitamin for epithelial cell function; nearly 40% of lung cells are of epithelial origin. The premature infant's lung often is the initial site of difficulties during extrauterine adaptation, and respiratory system epithelial-cell damage and chronic lung disease frequently develop. Because these infants have associated low retinol reserves, retinol supplementation to help repair pulmonary injury is being considered. Some of these relationships are beginning to be clarified by basic research on the metabolism and function of retinol in lung.\r"

They were switched to 19% fat at the same P:S for another four cycles. Fasting blood samples were collected during the follicular and luteal phases. Insulin receptors were measured from right-side-out ghosts. Insulin binding was significantly lower due to fewer receptors when subjects were fed the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet compared with the high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet. There was no significant effect of level of unsaturation or time of menstrual cycle on insulin binding. Thus, insulin receptors on erythrocytes respond to dietary lipids.\r"

An equivalent sweetening quantity of aspartame (162 mg) was ingested during the aspartame period. The addition of sucrose did not have a deleterious effect on glycemic control, lipids, glucose tolerance, or insulin action. No differences were observed between sucrose and aspartame. Sucrose added as an integral part of the diabetic diet does not adversely affect metabolic control in well-controlled NIDDM subjects. Aspartame is an acceptable sugar substitute for diabetic individuals but no specific advantage over sucrose was demonstrated.\r"

The partitioning factor (ratio of red cell carnitine to plasma carnitine) was four times greater than that observed in our reference population. After hepatic replacement, plasma and red cell carnitine approached normal levels within 6 mo. The partitioning factor, however, remained elevated at that time. These results indicate that 1) there is no evidence for carnitine deficiency in severe liver disease on the basis of carnitine concentrations in the plasma and red compartments and 2) altered partitioning of carnitine between plasma and red cells persists for greater than or equal to 6 mo after hepatic replacement.\r"

The characteristics of these measures (sensitivity to iron status, specificity to iron, and diurnal and day-to-day variability) are reviewed and the implications of choice of variable for the design, analysis, and interpretation of studies are discussed. Brief consideration is given to the question of confounding variables and to sources of both false-positive and false-negative conclusions. The explicit message of the paper is that there is no perfect choice of measure of iron status but, given explicit definition of the research question, there are preferred choices that can most effectively combine the choice of variable and the design of the study.\r"

It takes into account the contributions to development that come from organismic and environmental variables. These influences are modified by the effect of individual resiliency in the face of social and biological risk factors. Organismic, environmental, and individual differences are seen as making different contributions in different domains and at different periods of development. A distinction is made between the development of universal and nonuniversal behaviors. From this model, hypotheses can be derived about the effects of social and biological risk factors. The implications for developmental research designs are discussed as are the kinds of behavioral measures most likely to be sensitive enough to detect the effects of social and biological risk factors on the development of children.\r"

The increase in pain threshold is affected by diurnal factors and peripheral treatment with beta-endorphin has a significant analgesic effect, implicating selective changes in the blood-brain barrier. These effects along with modifications in responses to dopaminergic drugs, interactions of ID with neuroleptic drugs, and modifications in behavior as a result of selective brain lesions, lead to two conclusions: this animal model is appropriate for human anemia and the best explanation for the variety of behavioral and brain biochemical changes in ID rats is that the principal effect of brain ID is a selective decrease in the functional level of the dopaminergic D2 system.\r"

Most of these morphologic abnormalities were more prominent in the rh-GCSF-treated group. Monocytic cells in both groups showed prominent vacuolation and immature nuclei. The percentages and absolute numbers of large granular lymphocytes were increased in the rh-GCSF group compared with the control group. No quantitative or qualitative abnormalities of eosinophilic or basophilic granulocytes were detected in either group. Both groups showed nonspecific red blood cell abnormalities, and large platelets were present in half of the control group smears.

Ivy and Simplate II bleeding times were performed on each subject. The reproducibility was studied in 48 patients with mildly or moderately prolonged bleeding times that resulted from various disorders who had a duplicate Ivy or a duplicate Simplate II bleeding time. All subjects were randomized over the technologists and they were blinded for each other's results. By a receiver operating characteristic analysis, the Ivy method appeared to offer greater overall detection efficacy than the Simplate II method. For the Ivy method, the standard deviation of the ratios of the duplicate bleeding times was 0.37 and for the Simplate II method it was 0.33. The authors conclude that the Simplate II method is not superior in sensitivity or reproducibility to the Ivy method, which is cheaper, takes less time, and does not leave scars.\r"

No significant correlations were found between tumor beta 2-M expression and several histologic attributes such as type, histologic and nuclear grades, mitotic index, necrosis, vascular invasion, and lymphocytic infiltration. Likewise, beta 2-M was not associated with markers of disease extension such as TNM, (UICC, classification of malignant tumors) staging and axillary lymph node involvement or with estrogen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptor levels. However, there was a significantly positive association between tumor beta 2-M expression and the degree of lymphocytic infiltration in the tumor tissue. Beta 2-M serum levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 22 of the above women.

The findings showed that, in the control sera, 269 of 277 (97%) had negative results for CF antibodies. Of the 320 controls tested by the IF assay, all (100%) had negative results for IgM antibodies and 314 (98%) had negative results for IgG antibodies. Only 6 of the 201 (3%) controls by the ELISA were classified as negative/equivocal. Among the 450 patient sera, 105 (23%) had positive results for CF antibodies, and 158 (35%) had positive results for IgG and/or IgM membrane antibodies by the IF test; 424 of these patients' sera were also tested by the ELISA, and 397 (94%) of them were found to have positive results for anti-M. pneumoniae IgG antibodies. If the CF test were chosen as the standard for comparison, the IF test would have a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 81% and the ELISA would have a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 80%, provided an adjustment in the threshold ELISA-positive value was made. A single positive M. pneumoniae membrane IgM antibody titer appeared to be valuable for a presumptive diagnosis of an ongoing infection; 41 of 47 (87%) of the IgM-positive results in the paired sera were supported by a fourfold increase or a stable high level of CF antibody titer.\r"

Critical assessment of all prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trials reported during the study period shows that there is little information on the use of humidified air or supplemental oxygen, that racemic epinephrine hydrochloride is of well-demonstrated efficacy, and that dexamethasone phosphate at a dose greater than 0.3 mg/kg is effective in decreasing the length and severity of respiratory symptoms associated with viral croup.\r"

The presence of brain-stem dysfunction, particularly of lower cranial nerves in association with thalamic calcifications, constitutes a distinctive clinical-radiological entity and usually portends a poor outcome. The presence of these calcifications implies that injury was sustained to diencephalic and brain-stem structures at least 2 to 4 weeks prior to their appearance on computed tomographic scan.\r"

The rate of K pneumoniae bacteremia relative to all blood cultures in which bacteria were isolated was 1.1%. Children younger than 12 months of age accounted for 38 cases (67%). There were 8 children (14%) who were afebrile at the time bacteremia was documented; other presenting clinical features were generally indistinguishable from those that characterize pediatric bacteremia of more common causes. Fourteen children (25%) were receiving broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic therapy at the time bacteremia was documented. In 53 patients (93%), an underlying condition predisposing to opportunistic infection was identified, the most common of which were lesions of the gastrointestinal tract (56%), presence of an indwelling central venous catheter (35%), and neutropenia (25%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was a constituent of polymicrobial bacteremia in 15 patients (26%). The overall mortality rate associated with this infection was 20%, with over one half of all deaths occurring in infants who were afebrile at the time bacteremia was documented. Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia is a relatively uncommon, serious infection that usually occurs in young children with predisposing underlying conditions, and is associated with a significant mortality rate.\r"

Caretakers recorded the infant's sleep from age 4 to 21 weeks for one 24-hour period per week. Sleeping through the night was defined as sleeping at least 8 consecutive hours, with the majority of time being between the hours of midnight and 6 AM. The results were also reviewed changing the requirement from 8 hours to 6 hours. There was no statistically significant trend or a consistent tendency of one group to have a higher proportion of sleepers than the other. Therefore, feeding infants rice cereal in the bottle before bedtime does not appear to make much difference in their sleeping through the night.\r"

Development and perfection of the methodology were, at first, fraught with many difficulties, both procedural and technical, which had to be overcome. Significant opposition was engendered in the early years by some who claimed that the methods were both unnecessary and unduly dangerous. Time has proven otherwise. Progress came about as the result of a steady stream of publications from a number of centers documenting the successful and safe application of the methodology. A recounting is presented of the many contributions that predated development of the colonoscope and colonoscopy, and how the latter came about. For those coming into the art more recently, this review of beginnings is offered to allow a balanced evaluation of their craft.\r"

All patients underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic sphincterotomy. Patients with multiple choledochal stones usually presented with insidious onset of painless jaundice, simulating malignant bile duct obstruction, in contrast to the abrupt onset of cholangitis or pain experienced by patients with one to three stones. The latter patients had an increased number of duodenal diverticula, higher bilirubins, smaller stones, and fewer positive stones as detected by ultrasound of the bile ducts. Cholesterol crystals were more numerous in duodenal aspirates of patients with multiple choledochal stones. We conclude that multiple choledochal stones have a unique, more smoldering clinical presentation, and that ERCP is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is an efficient, simple, and safe alternative to surgery when there is no cholecystitis.\r"

This may reflect greater propensity of men to acquire renal disease, faster progression of renal disease, or a combination of both. In order to address this problem, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a well-defined genetically homogenous hereditary disorder, was studied. One hundred fifty-eight cases of the disease in adults were diagnosed by sonography and studied (73 men, 85 women); 58 of the patients had reached end-stage renal failure. Survival analysis of age at renal death revealed a significant gender difference (log-rank test, P = 0.0072): median age at renal death was 52.5 years in men and 58.0 years in women. In 64 patients with adequate sequential measurements of serum creatinine, progression of renal failure was followed retrospectively. When serum creatinine was greater than 3 mg/dL, the average rate of progression was similar in both sexes. In contrast to ADPKD, a sex difference for the age at renal death was not found in prepubertal individuals with hereditary renal diseases, ie, cystinosis or nephronophthisis. The data suggest that sex (hormones) influences evolution of renal failure.\r"

The clinical outcome and serology including hepatitis B DNA assays of 11 patients who were HBsAg-positive at the time of transplantation, as well as the hepatic complications in all 200 kidney transplantations during the same period, were analyzed. In the 11 HBsAg-positive patients, no clinical or laboratory evidence suggesting deterioration in liver function over a mean follow-up period of 8.0 +/- 1.7 years was found. Of six patients with fatal or severe chronic liver disease, only one was HBsAg-positive at the time of transplantation and showed no deterioration over 9 years. Two immunosuppressed patients developed anti-HBs antibodies after acute hepatitis B infection. A review of the literature leads to the conclusion that previous reports of poor patient prognosis may represent patients who first showed HBsAg positivity after transplantation or who had preexisting HBsAg-related liver disease. The present findings suggest that asymptomatic patients with positive tests for HBsAg should not be excluded from kidney transplantation programs.\r"

Real-time ultrasound studies were performed in 24 patients with initial exit-site infections; clinically suspected tunnel infections were excluded from analysis. A peri-catheter sonolucent fluid collection, considered a positive study, was demonstrated in 13 ultrasound examinations and tended to be organism-specific; eight of 12 Staphylococcus aureus exit-site infections and three of four gram-negative exit-site infections had positive studies. Only two of seven Staphylococcus epidermidis exit-site infections were initially positive on ultrasound examination. Nine of 13 patients with positive ultrasound studies ultimately lost their catheters to infection despite weeks of parenteral antibiotic therapy and local incision and drainage. There were 11 negative ultrasound studies. Only one of these patients' catheters was lost because of infection. In some episodes of CAPD-associated exit-site infections, especially those caused by S aureus and gram-negative organisms, ultrasound examination of the catheter course may be useful to diagnose unsuspected tunnel infections, direct early therapy, and confirm resolution or persistence of the infections.\r"

Two additional cases are presented in this report in which the nephropathy preceded the onset of the skin disease: one case with membranous glomerulopathy and one case of renal allograft rejection with concurrent membranous pathology. Both patients had positive immunofluorescence of the skin, typical of bullous pemphigoid. Institution of systemic corticosteroid therapy resulted in a satisfactory clinical response and cessation of the blistering process. These cases and a review of the literature suggest that the occurrence of an immune process involving these two different basement membranes is not merely coincidental. Many cases have been described in which the severity of the skin lesions paralleled that of the renal disease. Although the possibility of multiple distinct autoimmune processes cannot be excluded, anti-basement-zone antibody interactions or allograft rejection-induced immune stimulation are possible unifying mechanisms for the simultaneous skin and renal involvement observed in these two cases.\r"

Our consultand's initial carrier risk, as based on family history and creatine kinase determinations, was calculated as 0.6%. DNA analysis of her family (and fetus) modified this risk to 8.5%. Skeletal muscle of the 23-wk male abortus was found to be histologically indistinguishable from that of age-matched controls. However, immunoblot testing for dystrophin indicated that the fetus had indeed inherited dystrophin deficiency. The carrier risk of the consultand was thus elevated to 100%. Dystrophin assays should be employed whenever the diagnosis of fetal DMD is equivocal (e.g., cases in which a gene deletion cannot be identified). Assay results are crucial for genetic counseling for subsequent pregnancies and for studies of the early pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.\r"

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 222 patients from 10 countries. After a run-in period of one month of placebo therapy, patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to receive ketanserin 40 mg three times daily (n = 113) or placebo (n = 109) for three months. Total finger blood flow was measured in 41 patients in a warm and cool room before and during treatment. Vasospastic episodes were assessed by diaries and global evaluations. RESULTS: A significant reduction of 34% in frequency of episodes occurred with ketanserin, compared to 18% with placebo (p = 0.011). There was a 1% reduction in duration of episodes with ketanserin therapy, compared to a 2% increase with placebo therapy, but this finding was not statistically significant (p = 0.29). No difference was observed in severity of attacks. Global evaluations by investigators (p = 0.03) and patients (p less than 0.01) showed an overall benefit with ketanserin compared to that seen with placebo. Patients with primary or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon responded similarly to treatment. No changes in total finger blood flow were found. CONCLUSION: Ketanserin significantly improves the subjective symptoms of patients with primary or secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and is an appropriate agent to use in this disease when conservative measures fail.\r"

PATIENTS: Twenty-five patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent high-dose therapy and autologous stem cell infusion in the time period reviewed. An initial doxorubicin (Adriamycin)-containing chemotherapy regimen had failed in all patients. The most favorable subgroup included 17 patients who were less then 60 years of age and had received no chemotherapy beyond their initial doxorubicin-containing regimen when referred for bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: The complete response rate to the high-dose therapy was 52%, with an actuarial five-year disease-free survival of all patients treated of 40%. The overall survival at five years was 46%. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose chemo-radiotherapy, followed by infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells, can effectively function as salvage therapy in a significant number of patients in whom primary chemotherapy regimens for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma fail. This treatment approach appears to offer superior results when compared with the reported outcome for patients treated with salvage chemotherapy administered at conventional doses.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis have been associated with cyclosporine use in renal transplant recipients. Patients requiring heart or heart-lung transplantation may have additional risk factors for the development of gout, yet it has not previously been described in this population. We share herein our clinical experience with gouty arthritis in six heart transplant recipients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a one-year period, six hospitalized male heart transplant patients were seen in consultation for gouty arthritis. Five were subsequently followed for gout as outpatients; the sixth died within six months. Management included trials of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, allopurinol, and intra-articular steroid injections, as well as attempts to minimize cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. RESULTS: Three patients had gout in remission at time of transplant surgery, and three others developed gout for the first time two to 45 months after transplantation. Following transplant surgery, both pre-existing and new-onset gout appeared to exhibit an accelerated course, with unusually rapid development of chronic polyarticular disease and tophi in four of the five patients followed for more than six months. Peak serum uric acid levels ranged from 11.0 mg/dL to 16.5 mg/dL. NSAIDs produced reversible renal insufficiency in four patients. Gout-related infections occurred in three patients, one of whom died. CONCLUSION: Acute gouty arthritis may occur in the heart transplant recipient despite concomitant use of immunosuppressive drugs. Cyclosporine, with its attendant hypertension and nephrotoxicity, appears to be the major risk factor for hyperuricemia in this setting, leading to the accelerated development of tophi and chronic polyarthritis. Management is complicated by the patients' renal insufficiency and propensity to infection, as well as by interaction with transplant-related medications. Prevention of hyperuricemia by minimizing cyclosporine nephrotoxicity appears to be the best management strategy, with judicious use of allopurinol for those patients in whom this preventive approach fails.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To critically review the question of whether calcium antagonists can prevent or attenuate post-ischemic acute renal failure (ARF). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using a computer-assisted search, we identified all experimental and clinical studies published in English between 1980 and 1988 in which the main research question addressed the efficacy of verapamil, diltiazem, or nifedipine in the treatment of post-ischemic ARF. Studies were then selected for review based on clearly specified inclusion criteria and evaluated against accepted methodologic guidelines. RESULTS: In experimental studies of warm renal ischemia, calcium antagonists provided significant protection of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when given before and after ischemic injury; however, isolated pre- or post-ischemic treatment produced equivocal results. In autotransplantation studies on protracted cold ischemia, verapamil produced a modest, although physiologically significant, increase in GFR during warm reperfusion but failed to alter graft survival. Studies of calcium antagonists in humans with ARF have been confined to patients undergoing renal transplantation. Diltiazem given both to donor grafts and to recipients produced a significant reduction in the rate of delayed graft function but failed to improve one-year graft survival. This result may be due to the study of small numbers of low-risk patients. At present, there is no conclusive evidence that one calcium antagonist is more efficacious than another in the treatment of post-ischemic ARF. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium antagonists appear to prevent or reduce the severity of post-ischemic ARF only when given prior to and after the ischemic insult. As a result, these agents will have most utility in the setting of renal transplantation. Although the efficacy of these agents in reducing delayed graft function appears to be established, their failure to improve graft survival is poorly understood and requires further investigation.\r"

The vaccine's protective efficacy has been established in three groups at high risk for hepatitis B infection--homosexual men, institutionalized mentally handicapped patients, and neonates of mothers who are chronic carriers. Production of this vaccine on a large scale should make it less expensive than plasma-derived vaccines and thus broaden the indications for vaccination.\r"

However, non-responders and weak responders to HBV vaccine have recently become a problem among homosexual men because of an impaired antibody response due to previous infection with human immunodeficiency virus. In addition, human immunodeficiency virus infection predisposes persons to the development of a HBV carrier state following HBV infection. Vaccination still remains the most effective tool for preventing hepatitis B in homosexual men, although recent behavioral changes have apparently resulted in a decreased incidence of HBV infection among this group.\r"

There was no statistically significant difference in mean percent intraocular pressure lowering effect between the 0.5% and 1.0% apraclonidine concentrations. Most subjects treated with apraclonidine had a greater than or equal to 20% reduction in intraocular pressure from baseline. Twelve hours after instillation of apraclonidine, nine of the normal volunteers had an intraocular pressure of 10 mm Hg or less. Apraclonidine produced the same percent intraocular pressure decrease regardless of the initial level of intraocular pressure.\r"

Results showed that transscleral sutures should exit the sclera less than 1 mm posterior to the corneoscleral limbus for true ciliary sulcus fixation. The relationship of the ciliary sulcus to the overlying posterior surgical limbus differed in the vertical and horizontal meridians; needles that pierced the ciliary sulcus after being passed perpendicularly through the sclera entered the sclera 0.83 +/- 0.1 mm posterior to the posterior surgical limbus in the vertical meridians and 0.46 +/- 0.1 mm in the horizontal meridians. The major arterial circle of the iris (located in the ciliary body) was avoided as was the entire ciliary body during proper ciliary sulcus fixation. A one-piece, all polymethylmethacrylate, 10-degree vaulted, 13.5-mm haptic spread intraocular lens provides excellent optic centration and haptic stabilization when the haptic structure is placed at the greatest haptic spread and one transscleral suture pass per haptic is made.\r"

  ".W": "To study the possible role of the complement membrane attack complex, C5b-9, in an experimental rat model that is morphologically indistinguishable from membranous nephropathy in man (passive Heymann nephritis [PHN]), an antibody to rat C6 was used to deplete C6 levels to less than 5% of pretreatment values (C6D) during disease development. C3, C7, C8, and C9 levels were not different in C6D and control rats. After injection of nephritogenic quantities of 125I-anti-Fx1A antibody, the kinetics of disappearance of labeled IgG from the blood were identical in the complement deficient and sufficient groups, and glomerular deposition of 125I-antibody was the same in both groups at 5 days. Glomerular deposits of sheep IgG and C3 were also similar in C6D and controls, but glomerular deposits of C6 and C5b-9 neoantigens were markedly reduced or absent in C6 depleted rats. However, despite equivalent antibody deposits, proteinuria was abolished in C6D rats compared with normocomplementemic controls. Similar results were obtained when F(ab')2 anti-rat C6 IgG was used to deplete C6 during development of PHN. These results demonstrate that C6 is required for the development of the increased glomerular permeability that occurs in PHN, presumably because C6 is required for formation of C5b-9. We conclude that glomerular injury in the PHN model of membranous nephropathy in the rat is mediated by C5b-9.\r"

GCP/IL-8-induced edema formation was found to be neutrophil dependent. These data provide evidence that GCP/IL-8 fulfills two important criteria for consideration as an inflammatory mediator. It is possible that endogenous GCP/IL-8, if produced locally by tissue macrophages, may contribute to the initiation of the inflammatory response to infection.\r"

  ".W": "In mdx mice, the dystrophin gene of the X chromosome is defective and, as a result, immunoreactive dystrophin is undetectable in all muscle fibers of all animals of this highly inbred strain. This study showed that implantation of suspensions of clonal cultures of normal human myoblasts into different regions of quadriceps muscles of 6-to-10-day-old mdx mice or 60-day-old mdx mice (whose muscles have been crushed 4 days before implantation) results in the appearance of scattered fiber segments containing microscopically demonstrable immunoreactive dystrophin. In the animals that received the normal myoblast implantation in the prenecrotic stage of the disease (6 to 10 days of age), the dystrophin-positive fiber segments (demonstrated at ages 35, 45, and 60 days) escaped necrosis. This was determined by the absence of the characteristic chains of central nuclei, a reliable marker of prior necrosis in mdx muscle fibers. By heavy labeling of the nuclear DNA of the transplantable human myoblasts with H3-thymidine during culturing, and by sequential performance of an immunocytochemical staining for dystrophin and autoradiography on the same sections, some dystrophin-positive fiber segments were shown to contain radiolabeled myonuclei. It was concluded that nondystrophic myoblasts fused with host muscle fibers to form mosaic muscle fibers in which the normal dystrophin gene of the implanted myoblasts was expressed. This approach may be employed for the mitigation of the deleterious consequences of a gene defect in recessively inherited human muscle diseases such as Duchenne dystrophy.\r"

  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody EMR1a/212D, which recognizes the extracellular matrix in which lipids are deposited in atherosclerotic lesions, was developed previously. The macromolecule containing the epitope recognized by this antibody was purified from serum of WHHL rabbits, antigenic material similar to that found in serum and atherosclerotic plaques. The antigenic material was not associated with lipoproteins in serum. The antigenic material was purified in a single band by SDS-PAGE followed by DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden), EMR1a/212D coupled immunoaffinity column chromatography, and HPLC equipped with a TSK gel G3000SWXL (Toso, Japan) column. The purified antigenic material was a glycoprotein of molecular weight 66 kd. It was remarkably high in glutamic acid and aspartic acid but low in arginine and lysine. It had an isoelectric point of pH from 5.4 to 5.9. It contained 22.2 mg of sugar per 100 mg protein, and sialic acid at least expressed the activity of the epitope because the antigenic activity was decreased by neuraminidase treatment.\r"

The vaccine strategy assumes that the population to be immunized will respond favorably to these vaccine antigens. Using sera of 35 adults and 50 children from the The Gambia, West Africa, where Plasmodium falciparum is highly endemic, we examined the humoral immune response to candidate malaria vaccine antigens from sporozoites, merozoites, and gametes. We observed widespread restricted immunogenicity to defined parasite antigens in children and adults. HLA typing of adult lymphocytes demonstrated a marked diversity in HLA haplotypes in this population. Our results and those from our studies in mice suggest that genetic factors may partly explain the immunological non-responsiveness. This may necessitate re-evaluation of the malaria vaccine strategy.\r"

Procedures for strictures and miscellaneous conditions were performed in 284 patients with 21 deaths. Cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis was performed in 8,910 patients with 38 deaths. The data from the last 6 years of this study disclosed 30 postoperative deaths; only one of these patients might have been a candidate for lithotripsy or bile acid dissolution therapy. Nonsurgical alternative therapies for gallstone disease are unlikely to decrease the mortality from calculous biliary tract disease. Furthermore, stone recurrence will continue to be the major limiting factor for those techniques that fail to remove the gallbladder.\r"

Although each type of system generates shock waves by different methods, all currently available systems appear to be able to fragment gallstones. However, there does not appear to be any system that has demonstrated clear clinical superiority in terms of either efficacy or safety. Additional information, both clinical and experimental, is needed before it can be determined if the type of shock-wave generator has a significant effect on outcome. Clearly more than the physical principles of shock-wave lithotripters must be evaluated.\r"

Current criteria for selection of patients for extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) are presented herein. In addition, preliminary results from recent in vitro experiments with human gallstones obtained at cholecystectomy are outlined. The current criteria for selection of patients for treatment with ESWL are similar to those used in the initial German experience. They appear to ensure patient safety, but the actual conditions that predict successful treatment of gallstones by ESWL are not yet known, since the clinical and in vitro studies which will define the patient and stone characteristics that predict a successful treatment outcome are still in progress. Thus, current criteria should be considered guidelines for treatment which will most certainly be modified as experience is gained with ESWL.\r"

Gallstone fragmentation occurred in 95 percent of all patients and in 97 percent of those patients with solitary stones under 20 mm in size. The rate of clearance for solitary stones less than 20 mm in size was 50 percent. Unfavorable effects ascribable to lithotripsy were infrequent. All of the patients had pain before treatment, and one-third complained of biliary colic after treatment. Minor skin bruising which resolved in 1 to 5 days was found in 20 percent of the patients. This study lends credence to the findings of previous studies and demonstrates that lithotripsy combined with bile acid therapy is a useful therapy for cholelithiasis.\r"

  ".W": "The rationale, safety, and efficacy of cholesterol gallstone dissolution by orally administered ursodiol, chenodiol, or a combination of the two agents are summarized herein. Bile must be supersaturated in cholesterol for gallstones to form, and desaturation of bile by orally administered bile acids induces gradual stone dissolution. The mechanism of action of the two agents differs, but both cause a decreased input of cholesterol into the metabolic pool. Ursodiol is free of side effects, and the combination with chenodiol is equally efficacious and also has few side effects. Chenodiol, although an effective desaturation agent, causes diarrhea, mild reversible hepatic injury, and a small increase in the plasma cholesterol level. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy decreases gallstone size markedly and thereby increases the speed of dissolution by orally administered bile acids. Medical therapy with oral bile acids is appropriate for patients who present with small cholesterol stones and for patients with larger cholesterol gallstones who cannot or will not have surgery. Oral bile acids may also be valuable in the treatment of gallstone recurrence before it has become symptomatic or to prevent recurrence after prior successful dissolution of recurrent stones.\r"

Operative management, however, is an alternative means of therapy that carries negligible mortality, minimal morbidity, and a high success rate. If operative management is used, for most patients common duct exploration, stone retrieval, and T-tube insertion will suffice. However, if the patient has risk factors that suggest the possibility of further stone disease, a drainage procedure such as a sphincteroplasty or choledochoduodenostomy should be added. Nonoperative management is now the first choice for managing retained or recurrent bile duct stones. If these methods fail or cannot be utilized, operative management can be used with a similar low mortality, low morbidity, and high success rate.\r"

If no T tube is present, endoscopic sphincterotomy is usually the treatment of choice. In difficult cases, the radiologist may be able to assist the endoscopist by placing a wire across the sphincter through a percutaneous transhepatic route. If endoscopic sphincterotomy is not successful or feasible, an attempt at percutaneous stone removal can be made from a transhepatic approach.

The bile duct is cleared of stones in about 80 to 90 percent of patients. Available data, largely retrospective, suggest that surgery and endoscopic sphincterotomy are about equal with respect to removal of stones, morbidity, and mortality. Certain technical problems are discussed, including inability to insert the papillotome, the large stone, and problems relating to anatomy such as peripapillary diverticulum and prior gastrectomy. The treatment of patients with bile duct stones who have not had a cholecystectomy, with and without cholelithiasis, is controversial. Endoscopic sphincterotomy without subsequent cholecystectomy is adequate treatment for the majority of patients who are unfit for surgery, even if there are stones in the gallbladder, provided they are asymptomatic after endoscopic removal of stones from the bile ducts. Endoscopic sphincterotomy has been performed in the treatment of gallstone-induced pancreatitis, acute obstructive cholangitis, and sump syndrome. The complication rate for endoscopic sphincterotomy ranges from 6.5 to 8.7 percent, with a mortality rate of 0 to 1.3 percent. The most common serious complications are perforation, hemorrhage, acute pancreatitis, and sepsis.\r"

Even these approaches fail when stones lack access or are impacted within the biliary tree. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was evaluated in the United States in a multicenter trial with 56 patients. Stone fragmentation occurred in 91 percent of patients and duct clearance in 79 percent. Adjunctive procedures were used in 54 percent. Two ESWL treatments were required for fragmentation in 28 percent. Complications were mild and relatively infrequent. Hemobilia (8 percent), gross hematuria (6 percent), and biliary sepsis (4 percent) occurred less frequently than expected. There were no deaths during the 1 to 31 days of hospitalization (mean 9 days).

Fragmentation alone is usually insufficient for gallbladder stones, and dissolution is only possible for cholesterol stones. Although oral dissolution with or without ESWL is an attractive alternative to surgery, only 25 percent of patients are candidates for this therapy. Dissolution of gallbladder stones by topical application of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) is another option whose safety is still open to question. Therefore, cholecystectomy will remain the principal treatment for symptomatic gallbladder stones. Common duct stones can be eliminated in 90 percent of cases by endoscopic sphincterotomy alone, and fragmentation of large common duct stones by mechanical endoscopic lithotripsy or ESWL can bring the success rate up to about 95 percent. Unless cholecystectomy is also required, surgery will have a secondary role in the treatment of common duct stones.\r"

This study compared the pressor response of tracheal intubation with that of mask insertion in two groups of 24 and 23 healthy patients respectively. All patients were anaesthetised with thiopentone, nitrous oxide, enflurane and paralysed with atracurium. We have shown a similar, but attenuated pattern of response associated with mask insertion in comparison with laryngoscopy and intubation; significant differences between the groups were evident in arterial diastolic blood pressure immediately after insertion and again 2 minutes later. Use of the laryngeal mask may therefore offer some limited advantages over tracheal intubation in the anaesthetic management of patients where the avoidance of the pressor response is of particular concern.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty patients who had abdominal hysterectomy under general anaesthesia were randomly assigned to receive either epidural ketamine (30 mg), or epidural diamorphine (5 mg) peri-operatively and on first request for analgesia. Failure to obtain satisfactory analgesia with one of the agents was treated by epidural administration of the other. Pain was assessed by an independent observer, and by the patient using a visual analogue scale. The mean (SD) pain score on recovery from general anaesthesia, on a scale of 0-4, was 2.9 (1.2) for the ketamine group and 1.0 (1.0) for the diamorphine group (p less than 0.01). The mean (SD) time to first request for analgesia was 272 (206) and 72 (41) minutes in the diamorphine and ketamine groups respectively (p less than 0.01). All patients in the diamorphine group obtained adequate analgesia, but all patients in the ketamine group were changed to epidural diamorphine. Epidural ketamine does not appear to be a sufficiently effective alternative to epidural diamorphine for routine use in postoperative pain.\r"

  ".W": "In two randomised, double-blind studies of elderly patients with a mean age of 68.9 (range 21-88) years and young patients, mean age 29.4 (range 20-40) years, the effect of needle size on the incidence of postspinal headache was compared. The two needle groups, 20- and 25-gauge, were comparable in both studies with regard to number, sex, age and type of surgery. The incidence of postspinal headache in young patients was 27.6% when a 20-gauge needle was used and 12.6% with a 25-gauge needle. There was no significant difference in either the incidence of headache in the elderly patients (10.8% and 7.8%, respectively) or between the sexes. It is concluded that it does not matter if a 20- or a 25-gauge needle is used for spinal analgesia in elderly patients with regard to postspinal headache, but if spinal analgesia is indicated in young patients a fine needle is preferred.\r"

Isoflurane and enflurane were found to have similar depressive effects on the baroreflex control of heart rate when used in combination with N2O and O2. Suppression in the baroreflex sensitivity, defined by the slopes of regression line (change in msec of RR interval per mm Hg increase or decrease in systolic blood pressure) was from 7.1 +/- 3.9 to 1.8 +/- 0.7 msec/mm Hg in patients given isoflurane and from 7.8 +/- 4.3 to 3.0 +/- 1.9 msec/mm Hg in those given enflurane when evaluated by a pressor test (bolus IV phenylephrine). The slope of the depressor test (bolus IV nitroglycerin) also decreased from 4.7 +/- 2.8 to 1.9 +/- 1.5 msec/mm Hg with isoflurane and from 5.6 +/- 3.2 to 2.3 +/- 1.2 msec/mm Hg with enflurane. During surgery in which anesthetic concentration invariably needed to be increased, the suppression of the baroreflex sensitivity remained unchanged in both groups of patients. During recovery, the arterial baroreflex function in patients given isoflurane recovered more rapidly than that in patients given enflurane. This difference may be related to a more minor degree of suppression of isoflurane on the autonomic nervous system compared to enflurane.\r"

Twenty-six patients were randomly assigned on postoperative day 1 to receive either 20 ml preservative-free saline (group 1) or 20 ml 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine, 5 micrograms/ml (group 2) through an interpleural catheter. Adequacy of pain relief was determined by the amount of morphine used by the patient following interpleural injection. Morphine use via a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) system was recorded for several hours before and after interpleural injection. All patients had a forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 measurement immediately before and 1 h after interpleural injection. Mean hourly PCA morphine use ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 mg for the 6 h prior to interpleural treatment for groups 1 and 2. There was no difference in PCA use between the groups during this time. Group 1 patients did not reduce PCA morphine use after interpleural saline. Patients in group 2, however, significantly reduced PCA morphine use after interpleural bupivacaine. Mean PCA morphine use for group 2 was 0.38 +/- 0.15 mg/h (mean +/- SE) (81% reduction vs. control) for the first 2 h after bupivacaine (P less than 0.05). Mean PCA use in group 2 was 0.52 +/- 0.2 mg/h (73% reduction vs. control) for the third hour after bupivacaine (P less than 0.05). At the fourth and fifth hours after bupivacaine injection, mean PCA morphine use was not significantly different from that in group 1. FVC and FEV1 did not improve after interpleural saline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-two former preterm infants (less than or equal to 44 weeks postconceptual age) undergoing inguinal hernia repair were prospectively studied. General inhalational anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade was used. No barbiturates or opioids were given. Infants were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 received iv caffeine 10 mg/kg immediately after induction of anesthesia. Group 2 received iv saline. Respiratory pattern, heart rate, and SpO2 were monitored using an impedance pneumograph and a pulse oximeter, respectively, for at least 12 h postoperatively. Tracings were analyzed for evidence of apnea, periodic breathing, and/or bradycardia by a pulmonologist unaware of the drug given. None of the patients who received caffeine developed postoperative bradycardia, prolonged apnea, or periodic breathing, and none had postoperative SpO2 less than 90%. In the control group 13 (81%) developed prolonged apnea 4-6 h postoperatively. Fifty percent of the patients had SpO2 less than 90% at the time. This study shows that iv caffeine 10 mg/kg is effective in the control of apnea in otherwise healthy expremature infants between 37 and 44 weeks of postconceptual age. It is still recommended, however, that all infants at risk be monitored for at least 12 h for apnea and bradycardia following general anesthesia.\r"

The purpose of this study was to determine in a randomized, double-blind manner, the efficacy of a lollipop containing fentanyl citrate as a preanesthetic medication before surgery in children. Forty health ASA physical status 1 or 2 children 3-12 yr of age were divided randomly and in double-blind fashion into two groups. Group 1 received the lollipop containing OTFC and group 2 received a placebo lollipop. An appropriate size lollipop was chosen so that if the patient received fentanyl, the total dose would be 15-20 micrograms/kg. Anxiety, sedation, and separation scores were assessed preoperatively and ease of induction was rated. Oxygen saturation and respiratory rate were monitored. Time intervals from preanesthetic to induction and from recovery room (PACU) admission to discharge were noted. Recovery room behavior was assessed upon admission and discharge. Complications and the need for postoperative opioids were noted. OTFC produced significantly more sedation and less anxiety compared with that following placebo. Respiratory rate was significantly decreased in the OTFC group, but oxygen saturation was not significantly different between groups. Anxiety and separation scores and the quality of induction were better in the OTFC group. There was a higher incidence of nausea and pruritus in the fentanyl group. OTFC did not prolong the PACU stay.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of increasing airway pressure on the mean inspiratory flow and maximum minute ventilation (VE) capabilities of five anesthesia ventilators (Ohio Anesthesia, Airshields Ventimeter, Ohmeda 7000, Draeger AV-E and Siemens 900D) was compared to identify mechanical factor(s) limiting intraoperative ventilation of the lungs of patients with acute respiratory failure. The effect of increasing airway pressure on mean inspiratory flow was determined by cycling each ventilator through increasing restrictors. Maximum VE was measured under three study conditions using a test lung: 1) low compliance (10-30 ml/cmH2O) and minimal airflow resistance; 2) positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 0, 10, and 20 cmH2O at a compliance of 20 ml/cmH2O with minimal airflow resistance; and 3) increased resistance (19 +/- 11 cmH2O.1(-1).s-1) and compliance of 30 ml/cmH2O. As airway pressure increased from 0 to 80 cmH2O, mean inspiratory flow decreased markedly for all ventilators except the Siemens. The Siemens ventilator delivered the greatest VE under all three conditions and maintained VE when airway pressure increased due to decreased compliance or the application of PEEP; all other ventilators markedly decreased VE under these conditions. The addition of airway resistance reduced maximal VE for all ventilators by limiting the maximal inspiratory duty cycle (T1/TTOT). Thus, mean inspiratory flow of conventional anesthesia ventilators decreases with increasing airway pressure. The decreased inspiratory flow limits maximum VE when airway pressure is elevated because of decreased lung-thorax compliance and/or increased airway resistance, such as that characterizing patients with acute respiratory failure. Significant airway resistance further limits maximum VE by limiting the maximal T1/TTOT that can be used without increasing end-expiratory lung pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
