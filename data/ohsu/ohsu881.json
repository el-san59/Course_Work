The most rational use of these tests is to identify streptococcal pharyngitis when patients have severe symptoms or when special situations warrant early detection. Throat culture alone is sufficient for most other patients, and all negative rapid tests should be confirmed by throat culture. Specific antistreptococcal therapy should be initiated if either the rapid test or culture is positive. If the physician decides on the basis of clinical criteria to treat pharyngitis with an antibiotic that covers group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, a rapid test is not necessary. If confirmation of the infection is warranted in these cases, throat culture alone should suffice. No rapid strep test kit clearly outperforms others.

Exogenous sex steroids produce important effects on lipid metabolism. Early intervention against cholesterol is important in reducing cardiovascular risk. Current users of high-dose formulations, particularly older women who smoke, are at greatest risk for cardiovascular complications, especially myocardial infarction. Low-dose oral contraceptives have more modest effects on lipid metabolism, but important differences in the potency of progestins remain. Fortunately, recent studies among users of lower-dose oral contraceptive formulations fail to show an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Nonetheless, prudent physicians will avoid oral contraceptives that may adversely affect lipoprotein metabolism, such as those containing progestins with high androgenic and antiestrogenic potency.\r"

The degree and consequences of malabsorption are more dependent on the anatomic location of resection than on the extent, but the outcome and eventual capacity for absorption in any given patient cannot be absolutely predicted. Even patients who do not achieve independence from parenteral nutrition receive many psychological and physiologic advantages by attaining the ability to consume some foods.

Cholesterol gallstones were fragmented in vitro by means of lithotripsy, and the sonographic appearance of the fragmented stones was followed up over time to study factors that might affect the process. After lithotripsy, fragments settled and produced an echogenic focus with posterior shadowing indistinguishable from the appearance of an intact stone. These experimental observations led to the development of a clinical maneuver to overcome the diagnostic pitfalls posed by the reaggregation of stone fragments in situ. This rollover maneuver helps distinguish between intact stones and fragments, and prevents both diagnostic errors in follow-up and unnecessary retreatment.\r"

Various fluids (saline, iodinated contrast material, bile) supported different degrees of cavitation. Bile exhibited cavitation at low energy and gave rise to intense microbubble formation at 19 kV. Cavitation increased dramatically with an increase in the rate of generation from 1.0 to 1.8 shock waves per second.

The relationship between microbubble formation and clinical outcome of gallstone lithotripsy performed with a commercial lithotriptor was studied in 50 treatments in 29 patients. Microbubble formation in bile was a useful predictor of successful stone fragmentation in 31 of 34 treatments. Microbubble formation in the liver correlated with transient hepatocellular damage (as indicated by a twofold rise in serum transaminase levels) immediately after seven of 10 treatments. Advancing the focal volume of the lithotroptor deeper into the patient (placing the stone at the proximal point of the focal zone) may be a useful strategy for reducing hepatic cavitation effects, which appear to be responsible for temporary hepatocellular damage.\r"

In all patients, testicular torsion was considered to be a possible diagnosis based on findings from the initial clinical evaluation. Findings from surgery confirmed testicular torsion in seven patients. All cases were correctly diagnosed with color Doppler US. Scintigraphy enabled correct diagnosis of six, but findings were false-negative in one patient with 180 degrees torsion. One patient had a surgically confirmed scrotal abscess that was correctly diagnosed with both color Doppler US and scintigraphy. Findings from clinical follow-up in the remaining 20 patients were consistent with epididymitis, orchitis, or torsion of an appendix testis. There were no false-positive diagnoses of testicular torsion by means of either color Doppler US or scintigraphy in any of these 20 patients. Color Doppler US is at least as accurate as testicular scintigraphy and can function as an effective means of evaluating patients with suspected testicular torsion.\r"

Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment for shared vital organs are desirable for optimal obstetrical counseling and management. The authors retrospectively reviewed prenatal findings in 14 cases of conjoined twins. Thoracoomphalopagus was the most common type of conjoining, occurring in five cases (36%). Prenatal sonography showed shared hearts in nine (64%) cases, indicating severe conjoining and negligible chance for postnatal correction. Two sets of omphalopagus conjoined twins had separate hearts; however, severe congenital heart disease was present. Early prenatal diagnosis and assessment of the degree of conjoining provided couples with the option for pregnancy termination via vaginal delivery. In this series, nine patients elected pregnancy termination prior to 24 weeks and delivered vaginally. Transvaginal ultrasound significantly improved the delineation of conjunction in two patients, and computed tomography permitted the diagnosis to be confirmed in two patients.\r"

  ".W": "A new technique for hepatic intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA)--hepatoportal subtraction angiography (HPSA)--that emphasizes the enhancement of tumors by suppressing liver parenchymal enhancement has been developed. The tumor detection sensitivity of HPSA was evaluated prospectively in comparison with that of conventional hepatic intraarterial DSA, unenhanced computed tomography (CT) or CT enhanced with iodine-containing contrast material (conventional CT), CT with iodized oil, and ultrasound (US). For 84 detected lesions of hepatoma, the sensitivity of HPSA was 92%, statistically superior to the 71% of hepatic intraarterial DSA (P less than .002), the 42% of US (P less than .001), and the 39% of conventional CT (P less than .001) and nearly the same as the 90% of CT with iodized oil. Among 33 lesions of metastasis, HPSA depicted 91%; conventional CT, 93%; US, 87%; and hepatic intraarterial DSA, 76%. HPSA was more sensitive than hepatic intraarterial DSA, but the difference was not statistically significant. Compared with hepatic intraarterial DSA, HPSA enabled detection of more faintly enhanced tumors, and this technique was considered useful for detecting small hypervascular hepatic tumors.\r"

Thus, these mutations should be scored as transitions from 5-methylcytosine to thymine rather than from cytosine to thymine. Methylated cytosines occur exclusively at CpG dinucleotides, which, although markedly underrepresented in human DNA, are sites for more than 30 percent of all known disease-related point mutations. Thus, 5-methylcytosine functions as an endogenous mutagen and carcinogen in humans, in that methylation seems to increase the potential for mutation at cytosine residues at least by a factor of 10.\r"

C-myb is involved in regulating normal human hematopoiesis, and inhibits dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation of Friend murine erythroleukemia (F-MEL) cells. An alternately spliced c-myb mRNA encodes a truncated version of p75c-myb (mbm2) that includes the DNA binding region and nuclear localization signal present in the c-myb protein, but does not contain the transcriptional regulatory regions. Constitutive expression of mbm2, in contrast to c-myb, here resulted in enhanced differentiation of F-MEL cells. These data suggest that the c-myb protooncogene encodes alternately spliced mRNA species with opposing effects on differentiation.\r"

After a single-blind placebo phase, patients were randomized to receive nicorandil or atenolol using a double-dummy technique. Patients took nicorandil 10 mg twice daily or atenolol 50 mg once daily for the first 3 weeks, and if no adverse effects were encountered they took nicorandil 20 mg twice daily or atenolol 100 mg once daily, for the final 3-week phase. Treadmill exercise tests were performed at the end of each treatment phase immediately before and 2 hours after the morning dose of medication. Groups were demographically similar. Placebo exercise times were 7.06 (0.60) minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean) in the nicorandil group and 6.81 (0.47) minutes in the atenolol group. After 6 weeks, improvements in exercise time were before dosing: +1.47 (0.40) minutes with nicorandil (p less than 0.005) and +1.33 (0.29) minutes with atenolol (p less than 0.001). Improvements after therapy was administered were +2.45 (0.41) minutes with nicorandil (p less than 0.001) and +2.37 (0.43) minutes with atenolol (p less than 0.0001). Whereas, the predose peak exercise double product (heart rate X systolic blood pressure mm Hg/100) was reduced with atenolol (-43.6 units; p less than 0.001), an increase (+7.56 units; difference not significant) was noted with nicorandil. One patient taking atenolol and 5 taking nicorandil developed persistent headaches. One subject with severe 3-vessel coronary artery disease had fatal myocardial infarction within 3 days of starting nicorandil, 10 mg twice daily.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acyclovir administered preoperatively and for 3 months thereafter decreases the incidence of CMV disease from 29% to 8% and is the most cost-effective therapy. The effectiveness of these preparations in preventing CMV reinfection or reactivation has not been established. The utility of therapies other than CMVIg or acyclovir for the prevention of CMV disease has not been proven; CMV vaccination is ineffective, polyvalent immunoglobulins require further study, and interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has been associated with frequent irreversible rejection reactions and therefore should not be used for CMV prophylaxis. Although further investigation is necessary, patients at risk for primary CMV disease should receive prophylactic therapy with either CMVIg or acyclovir.\r"

  ".W": "Complement profiles on 22 hypocomplementemic patients with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) type I, on 11 with MPGN II, and on 16 with MPGN III, gave evidence that the nephritic factor of the amplification loop (NFa) is responsible for the hypocomplementemia in MPGN II and the nephritic factor of the terminal pathway (NFt) for the hypocomplementemia in MPGN III. In contrast, in MPGN I, there was evidence for three complement-activating modalities, NFa, NFt, and immune complexes. As a result, four different patterns of complement activation were seen. NFa, found in MPGN II, produces a complement profile characterized mainly by C3 depression. In addition, four of seven (57%) severely hypocomplementemic MPGN II patients (C3 less than 30 mg/dL) had slightly depressed levels of factor B, and one of seven (14%) of properdin, but in all the C5 concentration was normal. In contrast, all eight severely hypocomplementemic patients with MPGN II had depressed C5 and properdin levels, and six of eight (75%) depressed levels of C6, C7, and/or C9. Of eight MPGN III patients with moderate hypocomplementemia, 50% had depressed C5 and properdin levels and the remainder, depressed C3 only. This spectrum of profiles is most likely produced by varying concentrations of NFt. In MPGN I, nine of 23 (39%) had a profile indicating only classical pathway activation; seven of 23 (39%), a pattern compatible with NFt alone; four of 23 (9%), evidence for both classical pathway activation and NFt; and three of 23 (13%), a pattern compatible with NFa. The unique multifactorial origin of the hypocomplementemia in MPGN I, often giving evidence of classical pathway activation, together with previously reported differences in glomerular morphology and clinical features at onset, makes it distinct from MPGN III. Depressed C8 levels were found to some extent in all hypocomplementemic states. The levels were uncommonly depressed in patients with NFa, most markedly depressed with NFt, and moderately reduced with classical pathway activation. The cause is not known. Diagnostically, profiles showing classical pathway activation and low levels of C6, C7, and/or C9 are specific for MPGN I. Those showing only classical activation are likewise diagnostic of MPGN I if systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and chronic bacteremia are ruled out.\r"

  ".U": "90379205\r", 
  ".W": "Assessment of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) with inulin is cumbersome and time-consuming. Radioisotopic filtration markers have been studied as filtration markers because they can be used without continuous intravenous (IV) infusion and because analysis is relatively simple. Although the clearances of 99mTc-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA), 169Yb-DTPA, and 125I-iothalamate have each been compared with inulin, rarely has the comparability of radioisotopic filtration markers been directly evaluated in the same subject. To this purpose, we determined the renal clearance of inulin administered by continuous infusion and the above radioisotopic filtration markers administered as bolus injections, simultaneously in four subjects with normal renal function and 16 subjects with renal insufficiency. Subjects were studied twice in order to assess within-study and between-study variability. Unlabeled iothalamate was infused during the second half of each study to assess its effect on clearances. We found that renal clearance of 125I-iothalamate and 169Yb-DTPA significantly exceeded clearance of inulin in patients with renal insufficiency, but only by several mL.min-1.1.73m-2. Overestimation of inulin clearance by radioisotopic filtration markers was found in all normal subjects. No differences between markers were found in the coefficient of variation of clearances either between periods on a given study day (within-day variability) or between the two study days (between-day variability). The true test variability between days did not correlate with within-test variability. We conclude that the renal clearance of 99mTc-DTPA, 169Yb-DTPA, or 125I-iothalamate administered as a single IV or subcutaneous injection can be used to accurately measure GFR in subjects with renal insufficiency; use of the single injection technique may overestimate GFR in normal subjects.\r"

Medial smooth muscle cells showed localization of immunoreactive TNF on the cell surface and did not express TNF mRNA. Conversely, in intimal mesenchymal-appearing cells, TNF was localized in the cytoplasm and TNF mRNA was expressed by in situ hybridization. Thus 89% of intimal cells were immunohistochemically positive for TNF, 96% of them were positive by in situ hybridization, and 76% were positive for the smooth muscle cell marker, HHF35. Our results suggest that intimal mesenchymal-appearing cells are mostly, but not exclusively, derived from smooth muscle cells. These cells express TNF, whereas the medial smooth muscle cells in the atherosclerotic human arteries do not. The expression of TNF by these mesenchymal-appearing cells may have implications regarding the evolution of the atherosclerotic plaque.\r"

By performing immunohistochemical studies of cauterized mouse corneas, the in situ distribution of bFGF and TNF-alpha in the course of inflammatory neovascularization was investigated. bFGF was found throughout the corneal epithelium of untreated and cauterized eyes. However it was only rarely detected in the endothelium or in infiltrating cells before the onset of neovascularization. TNF-alpha was not expressed by any cell before the ingrowth of new blood vessels, which took place within 36 hours after cauterization. It is concluded that the release of these cytokines by infiltrating cells is of minor or no importance for the induction of sterile inflammatory angiogenesis.\r"

  ".U": "90379234\r", 
  ".W": "The neoplastic (Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg [H-RS]) cells in Hodgkin's disease (HD) are known for their unique capacity to form rosettes with unprimed T cells. Recently, a family of leukocyte-adherence molecules (LFA-1 and LFA-2) has been identified on T lymphocytes. The molecules bind to intercellular-adhesion molecules (ICAMs) and to LFA-3, respectively, which are associated with antigen-presenting cells. In this study, the authors examined whether these molecules are responsible for the homotypic and heterotypic agglutination that occurs in the cultured H-RS cells HDLM-1, HDLM-1d, and KM-H2. Despite their similar expressions of LFA-3 and ICAM-1, the different H-RS cells tested showed different growth patterns in culture. HDLM-1 cells grew singly, whereas HDLM-1d and KM-H2 cells grew in clumps. The HDLM-1 cells formed clumps when mixed with peripheral-blood T lymphocytes, cells of two lymphoblastic T-cell lines (MOLT-3 and MOLT-4), and cells of two monocyte lines (ML-1 and U-937). The addition of anti-LFA and ICAM-1 antibodies to cultures did not result in disassembly of the homotypic clusters of HDLM-1d or KM-H2 cells and it did not cause any significant changes in the size of heterotypic clusters or in the timing of cluster formation of HDLM-1 cells with other types of cells. In all studies, the cell clusters formed during homotypic and heterotypic aggregation were disassembled only minimally by cell shearing with pipetting. The disaggregation by pipetting was slightly more prominent in the presence of antibodies than was that of control cultures. However, in no case did the use of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and cell shearing cause complete disaggregation of homotypic and heterotypic clusters. The result seems to suggest that binding between H-RS cells and T cells and between H-RS cells and monocytes is not mediated primarily by LFAs and ICAMs, but that the binding may be strengthened in the presence of these molecules.\r"

Eleven of eleven skin specimens of systemic sclerosis patients and two of four skin specimens of localized scleroderma displayed the presence of fibroblasts expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin, a cell population that predominated in areas of prominent collagen deposition. A similar fibroblastic phenotype was found in the esophagus, the liver, and the lung specimens obtained from four patients who died of progressive systemic sclerosis. Immunostaining for desmin, performed on adjacent tissue sections, demonstrated that a minority of these fibroblastic cells present in skin and visceral lesions contained this protein. The authors' observations indicate that scleroderma fibroblasts are phenotypically related to the stromal cells previously identified in hypertrophic scars, fibromatoses, and desmoplasia; they might provide novel criteria for the characterization of scleroderma lesions and help to identify the factors responsible for phenotypic modulations in fibroblastic cells.\r"

  ".W": "Beta microseminoprotein (beta inhibin, PSP94), an unglycosylated protein of 94 amino acids with unknown function, is one of the predominating proteins in the secretion of the human prostate gland. In this work the authors have demonstrated that the expression of beta microseminoprotein is not restricted to the prostate and that the protein has a previously unrecognized widespread occurrence in the human body. According to radioimmunoassay, beta microseminoprotein immunoreactivity is present in many nonprostatic body fluids. The highest concentrations were found in secretions from the respiratory tract; in tracheobronchial fluid sometimes even at concentrations comparable to that in seminal plasma (about 1 g/l). Intermediate concentrations were found in gastric juice and some samples of secretion from the uterine cervix, whereas tears, saliva, pancreatic juice, bile, and mucus from the colon had low concentrations. According to gel chromatography, the molecular size of the beta microseminoprotein immunoreactivity present in tracheal fluid, gastric juice, and secretion from the uterine cervix did not differ from that of beta microseminoprotein in seminal plasma. The beta microseminoprotein immunoreactive component present in gastric juice had the same amino-terminal amino acid sequence as prostatic beta microseminoprotein (14 residues identified in material purified from gastric juice), providing further evidence for chemical identity of a nonprostatic beta microseminoprotein with the prostatic protein. Immunohistochemical staining with affinity-purified antibodies demonstrated the presence of beta microseminoprotein in many tissues, including the goblet cells in the tracheobronchial epithelium, tracheobronchial submucosal glands, certain mucosal cells in the antrum of the stomach, some glands of Brunner in the duodenum, and in parts of the mucosa of the colon. At least in the respiratory tract, the staining was localized to mucus-containing cells. beta microseminoprotein immunoreactivity also was localized to the cilia of the ciliated epithelium in the respiratory tract, the fallopian tubes, and the Gartner ducts of the uterine cervix. The pattern of tissue distribution of beta microseminoprotein found in this work indicates a connection of beta microseminoprotein with mucous secretions.\r"

In these studies, chromaffin and nonchromaffin adrenal neuroblasts were identified. To better characterize these nonchromaffin neuroblasts, the authors evaluated two additional markers: HNK-1, an antibody recognizing the migratory neural crest cell; and S-100, a protein expressed by sustentacular cells of the adrenal medulla. HNK-1 immunoreactivity was found in both chromaffin and nonchromaffin cell types at different times during development, marking the nonchromaffin lineage during the second trimester of gestation as well as the chromaffin lineage in the neonatal period. In addition, S-100 expression was noted in some nonchromaffin neuroblasts, and sustentacular cells were first identified at approximately 28 weeks of gestational age. These data suggest a model of human adrenal medullary histogenesis that incorporates the chromaffin, ganglionic, and sustentacular lineages known to constitute the adult adrenal medulla.\r"

The results provided an accurate measurement of the relative number of copies of the two genes in each tumor genome if the control and test sequences amplified by PCR were of equal lengths. The results were not affected by the number of PCR cycles used. This technique should facilitate gene amplification studies in clinical medicine. Increased c-myc copy number was found in 17% of the 30 cases examined when a control from the same chromosome as c-myc was used, but in 37% of cases if a control from another chromosome was used. This underlines the importance of the genetic location of the selected control genes for such studies.\r"

  ".W": "Here we report on a monoclonal antibody, H6-33, that labels various beta-amyloid plaques, including diffuse plaques in the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded section from the brain affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD), without formic acid pretreatment. H6-33 also labels some neurofibrillary tangles and all kuru plaques in Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease. In sharp contrast, H6-33 did not stain beta amyloid in the leptomeningeal vessel. For specific staining, H6-33 required the presence of fetal calf serum and it was necessary for beta amyloid to be formalin fixed. These results suggest that a novel protein in the calf serum, CSX, binds formalin-fixed beta amyloid, followed by H6-33 binding. The detection of beta amyloid by CSX was nullified by formic acid pretreatment of the tissue section. In accordance with this, CSX reacted only with a polymer form of synthetic beta peptide after fixation, but not with native beta-protein or beta-peptide monomer. These observations strongly suggest that 1) meningovascular beta amyloid should have a beta-pleated sheet structure somewhat dissimilar to that of beta-amyloid cores; and 2) most, if not all, of beta-protein immunoreactivities of diffuse plaques in AD sections are presumably derived from small amounts of amyloid fibrils scattered in the normal-looking neurohil.\r"

  ".U": "90379247\r", 
  ".W": "Laminin deposition is increased in fetal liver and in a variety of liver diseases, including the development of carcinoma. We investigated the role of the hepatocyte in the synthesis of both laminin and its 32- to 67-kd receptor in normal adult, fetal, and diethylnitrosamine-treated rat livers, and in adult rat hepatocyte primary cultures. Laminin was localized by immunoelectron microscopy in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes in fetal-derived and in 18-month-old diethylnitrosamine-treated rat livers. Steady-state mRNA levels for the three chains of laminin (A, B1, and B2) and the laminin receptor (LBP-32) were examined. Northern-blot analyses showed that hepatocytes at all stages lacked the A-chain mRNA. B1-chain mRNA was undetectable in normal adult hepatocytes, while significant levels of B1-chain mRNA were found in fetal hepatocytes and in adult hepatocyte primary culture. In hepatocytes from diethylnitrosamine-treated rats, B1-chain mRNAs were abundant and were present mainly in nodular formations rather than in the nontumorous areas. B2-chain mRNAs were barely detectable in either normal adult or fetal hepatocytes. In diethylnitrosamine-treated rats, the steady-state B2-chain mRNA level was higher in nodules than in nontumorous areas. In primary culture, B2-chain mRNAs were present as early as 4 hours after adult hepatocyte seeding, and dramatically increased during the following 2 days. Only low levels of laminin-receptor (LBP-32) mRNAs were present in normal adult hepatocytes, whereas the levels were high in the fetal and in the tumor-containing livers. In diethylnitrosamine-treated rats, LBP-32 mRNAs were more abundant in nodular formations rather than in nontumorous areas. In hepatocyte primary culture, the expression of the LBP-32 mRNA dramatically increased during the first 24 hours. These results show that in hepatocytes, expression of laminin chains and its receptor LBP-32 are not coordinated and depends on the maturation of the cells. In addition, they suggest that the expression of B1 and B2 chains in adult hepatocytes is related to changes of the normal phenotype and/or the pericellular environment.\r"

Two- and three-dimensional in vitro cultures, ie, monolayers and multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS), and nude mice-xenograft tumors as in vivo tumor models were compared. In addition, epidermal growth factor (EGF) was used comparatively in the in vitro studies. Morphologic signs of epithelial differentiation could be recognized in both cell lines gradually increasing from monolayers to MCTS to xenograft tumors. Cytokeratin (CK) expression is described as stable in A431 cells. Using immunohistochemistry, however, partial masking of CK antigens was found when applying the antibody 8.12 on monolayer cells and could be quantified by flow cytometric measurements. Fundamental cellular changes were found in a CaSki xenograft tumor, which showed newly established features of a keratinizing carcinoma after late onset of tumor growth. Epidermal growth factor caused reduction of both intercellular contacts and later onset of necrosis in MCTS, leading to an increased viability of the spheroids. Significant differences in differentiation of the tumor model systems indicates that the characterization of differentiation with immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry is necessary to assist interpretation of data obtained with these different tumor models.\r"

On day 22, they were instructed to stop smoking; medication was continued. Withdrawal symptoms on the first 28 days of treatment (baseline and 7 days of attempted cessation) were analyzed. During cessation, subjects taking doxepin reported significantly less craving for cigarettes. Results from this study and others suggest that antidepressants may attenuate the severity of symptoms during withdrawal from addictive substances.\r"

Solid data exist on dental health, nutrition and, to a lesser extent, childhood health. Data also were prominent in several disease categories including certain infectious diseases, pesticide exposures, occupational dermatoses, and lead levels in children. Estimates of the size of the migrant and seasonal farmworker population vary widely. Basic health status indicators such as age-related death rates are unknown. Prevalence rates of the most common cause of death in the United States have yet to be studied. More research is needed into the health problems and health status of migrant and seasonal farmworker families.\r"

When elderly patients were compared with younger controls, the elderly exhibited a statistically significant decreased plasma clearance (5.9 +/- 2 versus 12.1 +/- 4 mL.kg-1.min-1) and a prolonged elimination half-life (84.2 +/- 17 versus 56.6 +/- 16 min). Pharmacodynamically, a higher concentration of edrophonium is required in elderly patients to produce the same effect as in the younger controls. This observation may be explained in part by changes in neuromuscular transmission that are a function of the aging process. In addition, even though plasma concentrations were significantly greater at every sampling point in the elderly than the younger group, there was no difference between either the maximum duration or the total duration of action of edrophonium in the two groups. The maximum duration of action of edrophonium in both groups was very brief (1.3-2.2 min). These results contrast with a previous study of the anticholinesterases neostigmine and pyridostigmine, in which the action of these drugs was significantly prolonged in elderly patients. Explanations for the observed differences between edrophonium and other anticholinesterases may relate to differences in chemical structure and the possibility that edrophonium produces antagonism of neuromuscular blockade by a different mechanism than neostigmine or pyridostigmine.\r"

Neuromuscular blockade was monitored by recording the electromyographic activity of the adductor pollicis muscle resulting from supramaximal stimulation of the ulnar nerve at 2 Hz for 2 s at 10-s intervals. Patients were stratified into four groups according to age: 3 mo or older but not yet 6 mo (n = 10), 6 mo or older but not yet 12 mo (n = 10), 1 yr or older but not yet 3 yr (n = 10), and 3 yr or older but not yet 6 yr (n = 9). The mean ED50 of pipecuronium in these age groups was 18, 20, 21, and 24 micrograms/kg, respectively; the mean ED95 was 33, 38, 47, and 49 micrograms/kg, respectively. The ED95 of pipecuronium was statistically significantly less for the 3-6-mo-old patients than for children between 1 and 6 yr of age. Similarly, pipecuronium dosage requirements calculated on the basis of body surface area were significantly less in infants 3-12 mo of age than in children 1-6 yr of age. Thus, compared with children, infants appear to be more sensitive to the neuromuscular blocking effects of pipecuronium. Duration (T25) of action after cumulative dosing with pipecuronium was approximately 20 min in infants and 30 min in children. Spontaneous recovery indices were not prolonged in the younger patients. The average T25-75 recovery index was 27.1 +/- 9.6 min. There were no changes in cardiac rhythm, heart rate, or blood pressure attributable to pipecuronium during this study.\r"

Sixty minutes later they were given 6 mg naltrexone, 3 mg naltrexone, or placebo as an oral solution. Pain relief was assessed by the Visual Analog Scale.

We quantified the effects of pentamorphone (0.08, 0.24, and 0.60 micrograms/kg, IV) on ventilatory responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia in 12 healthy volunteers. Normoxic hypercapnia and isocapnic hypoxia were induced through a rebreathing method. During each test we recorded ventilation (VE), end tidal carbon dioxide tension (PETCO2), and arterial oxygen saturation (SO2) using a pulse oximeter. Using linear regression analysis of the relationships between VE and PCO2 during hypercapnia and VE and SO2 during hypoxia, we determined the slope (slope CO2) and intercept (V55), both at PCO2 55 mm Hg, and the slope (slope O2) and intercept (V80) at SO2 80%. Pentamorphone produced dose-related reductions in the ventilatory responses to both hypercapnia and hypoxia. Maximal depression occurred 15 min after injection of pentamorphone with all doses; the highest dose (0.60 micrograms/kg) produced 48% and 53% reductions in slope CO2 and V55, and 42% and 22% reductions in slope O2 and V80, respectively, relative to parallel saline controls. The respiratory depressant actions of pentamorphone were short-lived, as all parameters returned to baseline levels within 45 min. Testing was continued for 180 min after injection, but no delayed ventilatory effects were detected, and minimal side effects were reported, even at the highest dose. The findings confirm previous reports that pentamorphone has limited ventilatory depressant effects in humans in doses that (in other studies) have been associated with clinically effective analgesia.\r"

Each of 20 patients, ASA physical status I-III, participated in a double-blind, randomized study, involving four match-pair trials (placebo versus esmolol) during ECT. Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160). We administered a 4-min infusion of either placebo or esmolol at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. We then induced anesthesia with methohexital and succinylcholine. After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued. Statistically significant reductions in mean heart rate from minute 2 until minute 15 and in maximum heart rate (the mean of each patient's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 152 +/- 23 to 115 +/- 24 beats/min) occurred in patients given esmolol. During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased. Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 +/- 18 to 39 +/- 14 s and on electroencephalogram from 86 +/- 41 to 67 +/- 28 s. We conclude that esmolol effectively controls the hyperdynamic response to ECT and reduces the length of seizures. The significance of the latter to the overall effectiveness of ECT is not known.\r"

Because this phenomenon has been described primarily in healthy subjects, we prospectively studied the rapid infusion of vancomycin in 16 critically ill patients after open heart surgery in an attempt to document histamine release with resulting hemodynamic changes, and to see if there is any correlation with vancomycin levels. After establishing baseline hemodynamic stability and histamine levels, 1 g vancomycin diluted in 50 mL of 5% dextrose was infused over 30 min. Cardiac index, heart rate, blood pressure, pulmonary venous pressures, and systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances remained unchanged during the infusion. Although the mean plasma vancomycin level increased to a peak of 69 +/- 20 micrograms/mL after 20 min of the infusion before declining, mean plasma histamine levels in 15 of the 16 patients remained within the normal range during the infusion. In one patient a baseline histamine level (2.8 ng/mL) more than three times the normal before the vancomycin infusion increased further during the infusion (3.0, 4.9, and 5.0 ng/mL at t = 10, 20, and 30 min, respectively), and remained elevated (2.9 ng/mL) 30 min after the infusion. This patient developed the red-man's syndrome, although there were no hemodynamic changes. There was no evidence of myocardial depression in any of the patients. In conclusion, we safely infused a concentrated solution of vancomycin into critically ill patients over 30 min without any adverse hemodynamic changes. One patient developed the red-man's syndrome. There was no correlation between peak vancomycin levels and the release of histamine in this patient population.\r"

After induction of anesthesia and tracheal intubation, gastric fluid was aspirated through a large-bore, multiorifice orogastric tube. Gastric fluid pH was measured using a calibrated PHM62 radiometer. Gastric fluid volume was the total volume of fluid aspirated from the stomach. The duration of fasting was between 2.0 and 8.5 h. We found that neither gastric fluid pH nor gastric fluid volume correlated with the duration of fasting. The mean (+/- SD) gastric fluid pH was 1.80 +/- 0.79 and the mean (+/- SD) gastric fluid volume was 0.56 +/- 0.39 mL/kg. Gastric fluid pH was less than 2.5 and volume greater than 0.4 mL/kg in 53% of children.

Because nifedipine is often used to provide protection from coronary ischemia, a determination of the effect of CPB on plasma nifedipine levels might help to determine the potential clinical benefit of nifedipine during and after bypass. Four samples of blood were drawn from each of eight patients undergoing cardiac surgery: one before, two during, and one after CPB. Although plasma levels of nifedipine declined during and after bypass (P less than 0.05, analysis of variance), the time-course and slope of the decline indicate that this was an effect of normal metabolism of the drug rather than an effect of physiologic changes occurring during CPB. An important additional finding was that the majority of patients had subtherapeutic levels of nifedipine before bypass, suggesting that additional nifedipine given during and after surgery might be of benefit. The effect of the CPB circuit itself was also examined in vitro by mixing nifedipine into a pump prime solution that was then recirculated with 2 U of outdated blood while levels of nifedipine were measured for 3 h. Plasma levels did not change in either a CPB circuit exposed to light or kept in a darkened room.\r"

DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA EXTRACTION: An edited and updated summary of a Clinical Staff Conference held 26 October 1988 at the National Institutes of Health. The speakers discussed their own work as well as related work from other groups. DATA SYNTHESIS: The discovery that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS has permitted the development of rational antiviral therapy for this disease. Various steps in the replicative cycle of HIV can be targeted for intervention. More basic research into the life cycle of HIV is therefore likely to yield new therapeutic approaches. In 1985, nucleoside analogues called dideoxynucleosides were discovered to be potent inhibitors of HIV replication in vitro. Dideoxynucleosides selectively inhibit HIV reverse transcriptase after they are phosphorylated intracellularly to 5'-triphosphates. One dideoxynucleoside, 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT or zidovudine) has been found to prolong the life of patients with AIDS. This drug can partially reverse HIV dementia and decrease short-term progression to AIDS; it has been approved for treating HIV-infected patients with fewer than 500 CD4+ cells/mm3. AZT is only a first step in developing new therapy for AIDS. Its use is associated with toxicities, particularly bone marrow suppression. Several groups have reported the development of AZT-resistant strains of HIV. Other dideoxynucleosides whose toxicity profiles differ from that of AZT have also shown activity against HIV in early clinical studies. Large-scale, randomized trials of these drugs are now under way. Studies have shown that the binding of HIV to CD4 may be blocked by genetically engineered forms of CD4 and that HIV protease may be inhibited by substrate analogues. Protease inhibitors are an excellent area for further study in patients. Antisense oligonucleotide therapy may target the regulatory genes of HIV and is also being considered. CONCLUSION: With these advances, AIDS is gradually changing from an imminently fatal disease to one that can be managed with the judicious use of drugs and biologics. Progress against AIDS will continue, provided that researchers adhere to the principles of controlled trials.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies reported since 1985 were identified by a computer search using MEDLINE as well as from bibliographies of published work. STUDY SELECTION: Sixty-two reports on the clinical applications of the sIL-2R, largely from peer-reviewed journals, were identified. These reports address the utility and significance of sIL-2R measurements in various conditions. Basic scientific investigations delineating the biochemical and molecular features of the human interleukin-2 receptor complex and the sIL-2R protein were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: The validity of sIL-2R quantitation as an index of in-vivo immune system activation and its usefulness as a measure of disease activity and outcome were examined. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The quantitation of sIL-2R, a novel laboratory measure of in-vivo immune system activation, correlates reliably with disease activity in autoimmune inflammatory disorders, transplantation rejection, and specific infectious disorders. Markedly elevated serum sIL-2R levels are a particularly prominent feature of certain hematologic malignancies, such as human T lymphotropic retrovirus type I-associated adult T-cell leukemia and hairy cell leukemia, reflecting tumor burden and response to therapy. The sIL-2R level at disease onset may also reliably predict long-term prognosis in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and it appears to provide an additional serologic measure in the assessment of clinical progression in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Studies have suggested that sIL-2R levels offer a rapid, reliable, and noninvasive measure of disease activity, response to therapy, and, in some cases, prognosis in a broad spectrum of conditions associated with T- or B-cell immune activation.\r"

When samples were aspirated from the stomachs of the infants within one to three hours of feeding, however, they reduced titres of enveloped virus and also killed both Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli. The lipid fraction of the gastric aspirate from an infant who had been given human milk as well as those from four infants who had been given a conventional LBW infant formula feed, showed antiviral and antibacterial activities at least equal to the activities of the unfractionated aspirates. There was no consistent difference in antiviral or antibacterial activity of either the stomach aspirates or the lipid fractions of these aspirates between infants given human milk and those given formula feeds. The antiviral and antibacterial activities of the gastric aspirates seem to result from intragastric production of monoglycerides and fatty acids from the triglyceride content of the ingested feeds.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-three patients admitted for coronary bypass grafting were randomized to cardiopulmonary bypass with a bubble oxygenator (Cobe or Polystan) or a membrane oxygenator (SciMed). Plasma concentrations of C3 activation products and the terminal complement complex were measured using enzyme immunoassays. Both variables increased almost linearly after onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, with maximal concentrations at closure of the sternum. From a baseline of 7.5 to 12.0 arbitrary units (AU)/mL (medians), the concentrations of C3 activation products increased by 117.5 AU/mL (Cobe), 120.5 AU/mL (Polystan), and 213.3 AU/mL (SciMed). The increase in the membrane group was significantly higher than in the two bubble oxygenator groups (p less than 0.01). From a baseline of 0.9 to 1.3 AU/mL, the concentrations of terminal complement complex increased by 5.4 AU/mL (Cobe), 6.6 AU/mL (Polystan), and 7.7 AU/mL (SciMed) (differences not significant). The higher C3 activation caused by the membrane oxygenator may be explained by differences in flow profile and surface area in contact with blood. The study cannot confirm the general assumption that membrane oxygenators lead to lower complement activation than do bubble oxygenators.\r"

We believe that the mechanism of success is not window but rather fusion of the epicardium to the pericardium with obliteration of the potential space. To evaluate this, we studied 28 patients, all of whom underwent a subxiphoid pericardial window procedure with tube drainage maintained until output was minimal. There were no operative deaths, and 26 patients (92.9%) obtained permanent relief. Postoperative echocardiograms demonstrated thickening of the pericardium/epicardium and obliteration of the pericardial space. Autopsy performed on 4 patients who died of their underlying malignancy confirmed this fusion, which begins as an inflammatory process. A subxiphoid pericardial window relieves effusions with a low operative mortality and good long-term success (92.9%, 26 of 28). This success is dependent on the inflammatory fusion of the epicardium to pericardium and not maintenance of a window. Tube decompression should be maintained until fluid output is minimal to allow apposition and fusion of the two surfaces.\r"

Air pumps, later a bellows, raised and lowered pressure within the tank to assume the entire work of breathing. Popularly named the iron lung, the Drinker respirator supported thousands of patients afflicted with respiratory paralysis during the polio era. It was being superseded by positive-pressure airway ventilators just as the polio era came to a close. Today the Drinker respirator has disappeared virtually without a trace. Although its disadvantage was its cumbersome size, we must concede that it supported patients over the long term with fewer complications than do the respirators of today.\r"

Fifty-three patients who underwent radiotherapy an average of 28 months previously and 38 patients who received no radiotherapy were studied. Thirty percent of the irradiated group had lesions of the carotid arteries that were either moderate or severe vs only 6% of the control patients. Five patients were symptomatic; all had undergone radiotherapy. Long-term follow-up with sequential duplex ultrasound examinations is indicated in patients receiving high-dose radiotherapy for head and neck tumors, to detect radiation-induced carotid artery disease and prevent late sequelae.\r"

To examine this trend more closely, we reviewed 46 cases of renal venous thrombosis seen at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (Pa) over the last 32 years. Earlier, diagnosis was frequently supported by intravenous pyelography, which was 79% accurate. More recently, sonography confirmed the diagnosis with 92% accuracy. Of 21 patients diagnosed during life, 4 were treated operatively and 3 survived. Of 17 patients treated nonoperatively, 14 (82%) survived, including 5 with bilateral disease. Since 1978, of the 10 patients treated nonoperatively, 9 have survived with no long-term morbidity. Our experience confirms that early diagnosis with sonography followed by supportive nonoperative therapy offers the best chance for success in patients with renal venous thrombosis.\r"

His technique was based on limited opening of the left side of the chest directly over the common or undivided pulmonary artery and encircling the proximal aorta and pulmonary artery together through the transverse sinus of the pericardium. Both vessels were to be occluded by traction on the encircling band. Emboli were to be extracted through a small pulmonary arteriotomy, which then was to be controlled by a tangentially applied clamp, while occlusion of the great blood vessels was released. Unfortunately, during the first clinical trial of the technique, the patient died because of technical difficulties. Not until 1924 was a surviving patient described, by Trendelenburg's former trainee, Martin Kirschner.\r"

We managed 19 consecutive cases of traumatic hemorrhagic retinal detachment with pars plana vitrectomy, scleral buckling, and fluid-gas exchange, with or without internal drainage of subretinal hemorrhage. We based our approach on the amount of subretinal hemorrhage present and the location of associated retinal breaks. Internal drainage of subretinal hemorrhage was performed in 16 eyes to allow adequate retinopexy to hemorrhagically elevated retinal breaks (9 eyes), to remove massive subretinal hemorrhage (4 eyes), and to allow intraoperative reattachment when the retina exhibited bullous retinal detachment (3 eyes). Overall, with a minimum of 6 months of follow-up, anatomic reattachment was achieved in 13 (68%) of 19 eyes, and functional success (visual acuity 5/200 or better) was achieved in 6 (32%) of 19 eyes. Anatomic failure resulted from proliferative vitreoretinopathy (4 eyes) and globe atrophy (2 eyes). Drainage of subretinal blood appeared to be beneficial for hemorrhagically elevated retinal tears to allow adequate retinopexy and may help to accomplish long-term anatomic attachment in eyes with massive subretinal hemorrhage or bullous retinal detachment.\r"

Bayes' theorem allows a mathematical approach to the assessment of the utility of a laboratory test based on the sensitivity of the test, the specificity of the test, and the pretest likelihood that the disease the test is intended to identify is present. We have utilized Bayes' theorem to assess the utility of routine antinuclear antibody and purified protein derivative testing in patients with uveitis. Based on published data about the sensitivity and specificity of each of these tests, as well as the prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus and tuberculosis among patients with uveitis, we calculated that a patient with uveitis and a positive antinuclear antibody test result has less than a 1% chance of having systemic lupus erythematosus and that a patient with uveitis and a positive purified protein derivative test result has a 1% likelihood of having tuberculosis. These low probabilities mean that neither test is useful in the routine evaluation of patients with uveitis, and indiscriminate use may lead to improper diagnosis, increased costs, and, occasionally, inappropriate therapy.\r"

Immunofluorescence was used to study the wound healing response histopathologically. The distribution of fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, collagen types III, IV, and VI, and keratan sulfate was determined at postoperative intervals of 24 hours, 6 days, and 1 month. At 24 hours, fibrinogen and fibronectin coated the ablated surface, but corneal epithelial cells had not yet migrated over the wound. By 6 days and persisting at 1 month, an epithelial ingrowth of seven to 10 layers, mild stromal hypercellularity, and new collagen formation were present in the repair region. At 1 month, fibrinogen, fibronectin, laminin, and type III collagen were strongly detected in the repair region. Type VI collagen was present in both normal and healed corneal stroma at all intervals, and type IV collagen was present in Descemet's membrane only. Sulfated keratan sulfate was absent from the newly synthesized collagen stroma at all intervals. Slit-lamp photographs demonstrated corneal haze in the ablation zone in all cases at 24 hours, persisting for 1 month. The fluorescence patterns produced by excimer laser ablation and mechanical keratectomy were qualitatively identical.\r"

  ".W": "This paper presents a review and comparison of qualitative improvements in the organization, needs assessment, educational methodology, evaluation, and research in continuing medical education (CME) in the United States and Canada. Although accreditation now establishes minimal standards for CME and reduces the chances of irresponsible programs, some organizational issues (such as commercial sponsorship) and educational issues (how to \"accredit\" journal reading) remain unresolved. There are many examples of excellent, innovative CME programs offered by medical schools, and specialty societies have been instrumental in upgrading CME by serving as sponsors of accreditation and special projects. There is some evidence that the national health system of Canada has influenced the organization and content of Canadian CME, and these changes may soon affect U.S. programs as well. CME research has grown, with two types of research evident: the biomedical model, which assesses the efficacy of CME interventions by quantitative methods; and a model that uses grounded, ethnographic, methods to assess physician learning and performance change. Given the improvements of the past 20 years, the criticisms that focus exclusively on the lack of ideal educational planning for all CME programs are not so much wrong as dated and perhaps irrelevant. In developing their programs, CME leaders can begin to emphasize the physician learner and the clinical and social environment in which learning occurs.\r"

The intensity of cell membrane staining was assessed using the 10-cm visual analogue scale technique and the results analysed using non-parametric statistics. The cell membranes in BCC showed significantly less intense staining when compared to normal epidermal cells (P less than 0.001) and the constituent cells of SW (P less than 0.001), SK (P less than 0.001), BD (P less than 0.01), and SCC (P less than 0.001). Classification of the specimens into normal, benign, premalignant and malignant indicated that cell membranes of malignant tumours showed significantly less staining than the other groups (P less than 0.001). The observed reduction in the epidermal growth factor receptors in malignant tumours may be due to occupation and down regulation in response to autocrine secretion of growth factors.\r"

  ".W": "Nine pediatric patients (median age, 8 years; range, 0.7 to 19 years), eight with refractory aplastic anemia and one with newly diagnosed aplasia, were enrolled in a phase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) administered via continuous intravenous infusion. Doses ranged from 8 to 32 micrograms/kg/d. Six of eight evaluable patients responded with a significant rise in neutrophil count (median fourfold increase; range, 2.5- to 31-fold) during the 28-day induction period. Five patients completed 2 further months of therapy (maintenance) with persistent or improved neutrophil responses. Three patients had bone marrow aspirates suggestive of increased erythropoiesis, although only one patient had improvement in peripheral hematocrit and platelet count. In the five patients completing maintenance, three experienced a rapid return to baseline counts after rhGM-CSF was discontinued, one maintained a neutrophil response for 2 months after drug discontinuation, and one has maintained a trilineage response for greater than 1 year off study. Drug therapy was well tolerated. Toxicity was minimal at doses from 8 to 16 micrograms/kg/d. Fever and rash were more commonly seen at 32 micrograms/kg/d. No patient developed an infection during the course of rhGM-CSF administration. These results demonstrate that rhGM-CSF increases peripheral neutrophil counts in children with refractory and newly diagnosed aplastic anemia and may be able to stimulate a multilineage response in a more limited number. Randomized, prospective trials are necessary to determine if rhGM-CSF administration will impact favorably on the morbidity and mortality of severe aplastic anemia.\r"

Recombinant MIP-1 alpha, -1 beta, and -2 enhanced muCFU-GM colonies above that stimulated with 10 to 100 U natural mu macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or rmuGM-CSF, with enhancement seen on huCFU-GM colony formation stimulated with suboptimal rhuM-CSF or rhuGM-CSF; effects were neutralized by respective MIP-specific antibodies. Macrophage inflammatory proteins had no effects on mu or huBFU-E colonies stimulated with erythropoietin (Epo). However, natural MIP-1 and rMIP-1 alpha, but not rMIP-1 beta or -2, suppressed muCFU-GM stimulated with pokeweed mitogen spleen-conditioned medium (PWMSCM), huCFU-GM stimulated with optimal rhuGM-CSF plus rhu interleukin-3 (IL-3), muBFU-E and multipotential progenitors (CFU-GEMM) stimulated with Epo plus PWMSCM, and huBFU-E and CFU-GEMM stimulated with Epo plus rhuIL-3 or rhuGM-CSF. The suppressive effects of natural MIP-1 and rMIP-1 alpha were also apparent on a population of BFU-E, CFU-GEMM, and CFU-GM present in cell-sorted fractions of human bone marrow (CD34 HLA-DR+) highly enriched for progenitors with cloning efficiencies of 42% to 75%. These results, along with our previous studies, suggest that MIP-1 alpha, -1 beta, and -2 may have direct myelopoietic enhancing activity for mature progenitors, while MIP-1 alpha may have direct suppressing activity for more immature progenitors.\r"

In this study, the distribution of SER on macrophages within hematopoietic clusters was localized by a monoclonal antibody, SER-4, by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. SER was found to be diffusely localized at the contact zones between macrophages and erythroblasts, whereas the receptor was highly concentrated at the contacts between macrophages and developing myelomonocytic cells. These data suggest that SER on resident bone marrow macrophages interacts differentially with sialylated ligands on developing myeloid cells and that this may influence their development.\r"

Fetal globin production by BFUe-derived erythroblasts was assessed at the protein and mRNA level and its cellular distribution was evaluated by immunofluorescence. Although hemoglobinization and maturation of BFUe-derived erythroblasts was by and large comparable in FBS-replete versus FBS-deprived cultures, the latter had significantly less (up to 20-fold) gamma-globin and gamma-globin mRNA levels. Reduced gamma-globin in serum-deprived cultures was also reflected by a smaller proportion of erythroblasts with detectable gamma-globin by immunofluorescence. Erythroid bursts induced by either GM-CSF or IL-3 produced similar levels of gamma-globin both in FBS-supplemented and in FBS-deprived cultures. These results, obtained even in cultures of highly enriched BFUe, suggest that GM-CSF and IL-3, although they significantly increase the number and size of erythroid bursts, do not by themselves exert a direct influence on the level of fetal globin synthesis. By contrast, factor(s) present in FBS appear to exert a dominant influence on fetal globin synthesis in vitro. Although FBS-deprived conditions appear to largely abrogate the in vitro activation of fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) in normal samples, they do support increased Hb F production in samples from patients with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin or from cord blood.\r"

  ".W": "Previous reports have indicated that mutations of the RAS oncogenes are not associated with the chronic phase of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph1+ CML). However, further studies were needed to determine their association with Ph1- CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Therefore, 6 patients with Ph1- CML who were also negative for BCR rearrangements (Ph1-/BCR- CML) and 30 patients with CMML were analyzed for the presence of RAS oncogene point mutations to determine the similarities of these diseases at the molecular level. The assay used the polymerase chain reaction for amplification of the target RAS sequences and panels of specific synthetic oligonucleotide probes for hybridization to wild type and/or mutated sequences. None of the six Ph1-/BCR- CML patients had mutations in the RAS oncogenes, while 17 of 30 (57%) of the CMML patients had RAS oncogene mutations. Eighty percent of the mutations involved substitution of aspartic acid for glycine (G----A) in the 12th or 13th codons of N-ras or K-ras. Furthermore, although not statistically significant, survival studies raise the possibility of shortened survival in patients with RAS oncogene point mutations, with the average survival being 33 months for Ph1-/BCR- CML, 35 months for CMML without point mutations, and 11 months for CMML with RAS mutations. Thus, RAS mutations appear to be associated with CMML and not Ph1-/BCR- chronic phase CML, there is a high propensity for the K-ras or N-ras mutations to involve an G----A substitution in the 12th or 13th codons, and RAS mutations in CMML may relate to prognosis and require further studies.\r"

  ".W": "The treatment of human U-937 leukemia cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) is associated with induction of monocytic differentiation. However, the signaling pathways responsible for induction of the differentiated monocytic phenotype remain unclear. The present studies demonstrate that dexamethasone blocks TPA-induced U-937 cell growth inhibition, adherence, and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase staining. The results also demonstrate that dexamethasone inhibits the appearance of c-fms transcripts associated with TPA treatment. Run-on transcription assays demonstrated that the c-fms gene is transcriptionally active in uninduced U-937 cells and that the rate of transcription is unchanged after dexamethasone and/or TPA treatment. These findings indicated that TPA increases c-fms expression by a dexamethasone-sensitive posttranscriptional mechanism. Treatment of U-937 cells with TPA was also associated with stimulation of arachidonic acid metabolism. Furthermore, dexamethasone, an inhibitor of phospholipase A2 activity, blocked TPA-induced increases in arachidonic acid release. These findings suggested that TPA may regulate certain features of monocytic differentiation, such as c-fms gene expression, through the formation of arachidonic acid metabolites. Indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, had no detectable effect on c-fms gene expression. However, the cyclooxygenase metabolite, prostaglandin E2, inhibited the TPA-induced increases in c-fms mRNA levels. Taken together, the results indicate that TPA regulates c-fms gene expression by a dexamethasone-sensitive mechanism and that c-fms mRNA levels are controlled by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway.\r"

  ".W": "Deferoxamine (DF) has antimalarial activity that can be demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This study is designed to examine the speed of onset and stage dependency of growth inhibition by DF and to determine whether its antimalarial activity is cytostatic or cytocidal. Growth inhibition was assessed by suppression of hypoxanthine incorporation and differences in morphologic appearance between treated and control parasites. Using synchronized in vitro cultures of Plasmodium falciparum, growth inhibition by DF was detected within a single parasite cycle. Ring and nonpigmented trophozoite stages were sensitive to the inhibitory effect of DF but cytostatic antimalarial activity was suggested by evidence of parasite recovery in later cycles. However, profound growth inhibition, with no evidence of subsequent recovery, occurred when pigmented trophozoites and early schizonts were exposed to DF. At this stage in parasite development, the activity of DF was cytocidal and furthermore, the critical period of exposure may be as short as 6 hours. These observations suggest that iron chelators may have a role in the treatment of clinical malaria.\r"

SETTING--Outpatient department of the Tuberculosis Research Centre, paediatric surgery departments of the Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children and the Government Stanley Hospital, Madras, South India. PATIENTS--Children aged 1-12 years with extensive, multiple site, superficial tuberculous lymphadenitis confirmed by biopsy (histopathology or culture). INTERVENTIONS--Patients were treated with a fully supervised intermittent chemotherapy regimen consisting of streptomycin, rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide three times a week for two months followed by streptomycin and isoniazid twice a week for four months on an outpatient basis. Surgery was limited to biopsy of nodes for diagnosis and assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Response to chemotherapy was assessed by regression of lymph nodes and healing of sinuses and abscesses during treatment and follow up. Compliance with treatment and frequency of adverse reactions were also estimated. RESULTS--197 Patients were admitted to the study and 168 into the analysis. The regimen was well tolerated and compliance was good with 101 (60%) patients receiving the prescribed chemotherapy within 15 days of the stipulated period of six months. Those whose chemotherapy extended beyond that period received the same total number of doses. Clinical response was favourable in most patients at the end of treatment. Sinuses and abscesses healed rapidly. Residual lymphadenopathy (exceeding 10 mm diameter) was present in 50 (30%) patients at the end of treatment; these nodes were biopsied. Fresh nodes, increase in size of nodes, and sinuses and abscesses occurred both during treatment and follow up. After 36 months of follow up after treatment only 5 (3%) patients required retreatment for tuberculosis. CONCLUSION--Tuberculous lymphadenitis in children can be successfully treated with a short course chemotherapy regimen of six months.\r"

Endosonography agreed with the staging in 19, CT in 16 and MRI in 18 patients. For the remaining 17 patients, endosonography agreed with the EUA findings in 13, CT in 12 and MRI in 12. This study has shown that endosonography and MRI are more accurate than CT in the local staging of carcinoma of the cervix. Computed tomography was least accurate in staging early tumours and differentiating between Stage Ib and IIb disease. Lymph node involvement was detected with equal frequency by both CT and MRI. Magnetic resonance imaging was useful in identifying vaginal and bladder wall involvement and in one patient showed features due to an unsuspected early pregnancy.\r"

To clarify this concept and to understand the meaning of the above echographic features better, the authors have examined prospectively by sonography the kidneys of 50 children, 200 adults with a single collecting system, 25 adults with a duplicated collecting system and 32 cadavers. Furthermore, to help explain the sonographic features, we have examined 32 cadaver kidneys with sonography and 10 cadaver kidneys with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The sonographic, MRI and anatomical correlations have shown that the \"echogenic triangle\" and the \"echogenic line\" are not renuncular residuals, but simply an extension of the hilar fat visible when the renal sinus is rather deep. The intermediate cortical mass is not a septum dividing the kidney into an upper and lower renunculus, but a column of parenchymal tissue crossing the renal sinus, which, from an anatomical point of view, is an accessory renal lobe. The presence of two renunculi, suggested in a previous study with cortical nephrotomography, has not been confirmed.\r"

These patients received a six-dose regimen of 0.01 mg/kg (low dose) or 0.18 mg/kg (high dose) of ondansetron. Seven (41%) patients in the high-dose group had no emesis and four (24%) patients had one or two episodes. One (5%) patient in the low-dose group had no emesis and four (21%) patients had one or two episodes. The difference in the number of emetic episodes was significant (P less than 0.02). Fifty percent of the high-dose patients reported no nausea or mild nausea, compared with 11% of the low-dose patients. Clinical adverse events included mild, transient headache and dizziness in the high-dose group and headache and diarrhea in the low-dose group, with no significant laboratory abnormalities. There is a parallel relationship between the ondansetron doses and the antiemetic efficacy. The response rate for the six-dose regimen of 0.18 mg/kg was not superior to that for the previously reported 0.18 mg/kg regimen given in a three-dose schedule in a similar clinical setting.\r"

  ".U": "90381630\r", 
  ".W": "The Children's Cancer Study Group instituted a pilot study to investigate the use of high doses of cytosine arabinoside (AraC) in the intensification phase of treatment for acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Patients achieving remission and not eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were treated with four doses of high-dose AraC and L-asparaginase. These drugs were repeated either on or after 28 days (q28 days), after recovery of hematologic parameters (for the first 49 patients entered onto this trial); or after 7 days (q7 days), despite dropping blood counts (for the last 53 patients enrolled). After completing an additional 3 months of intensification therapy, patients were then allocated by physician choice to either discontinue therapy or receive 18 28-day cycles of maintenance therapy, including the daily administration of 6-thioguanine. Despite three deaths associated with the toxicity of the aggressive (q7 days) AraC timing, patients receiving this approach demonstrated equal or better disease-free survival from the end of induction (55% versus 42% actuarially at 3 years [P = 0.52]). Maintenance therapy appeared to play no role in improving outcome for people who received the aggressive timing of AraC cycles. Fifty-nine percent were alive disease free actuarially at 3 years from the decision to not give maintenance therapy (n = 27) compared with 62% for those receiving maintenance therapy (n = 16; P = 0.49). On the other hand, patients who received the less aggressive AraC intensification timing (q28 days) had an improved survival rate if maintenance therapy was administered (n = 17) (65% versus 39% for patients not receiving maintenance therapy [n = 24] at 3 years [P = 0.07]). Maintenance therapy therefore may not improve outcome in patients receiving aggressive timing of high-dose AraC but may be important in less intensive postremission regimens in childhood ANLL.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-five newly diagnosed patients with diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL) treated by cyclophosphamide (CTX), doxorubicin (ADM), vincristine (VCR), and prednisone (CHOP regimen) chemotherapy were evaluated for survival factors including dose intensity (DI). DI calculations were done for the initial cycles needed to achieve maximal response. The medians of the relative DI for CTX, ADM, and VCR were 0.9, 0.86, and 0.79, respectively. The median of the average relative DI (ARDI) was 0.83 (range, 0.28 to 1.14). The univariate analysis of potential prognostic variables showed that the following significantly decreased the survival rate: age older than 60 years (P = 0.0005), Stage III to IV (P = 0.02), male sex (P = 0.03), and all four DI variables (CTX, ADM, VCR, and ARDI) less than the median (P = 0.01 to 0.0001). A multivariate analysis by the stepwise proportional hazards model of Cox indicated that the factors predicting a poor prognosis were ARDI less than the median (P = 0.0003) and age older than 60 years (P = 0.02). A multivariate survival analysis of those who achieved complete remission showed ARDI less than the median (P = 0.0003), CTX less than the median (P = 0.02), and Stage III to IV (P = 0.02) to be the most negative factors regarding survival. In conclusion, a high DI in the initial cycles of CHOP chemotherapy for DLCL has a significant positive impact on survival.\r"

Control studies in the authors' laboratory indicated that LN3 positivity in paraffin-embedded tissue correlates well with HLA-DR antigen expression. Accordingly they examined 212 cases of diffuse large cell lymphoma from one of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group's (ECOG) high-grade malignant lymphoma treatment protocols. All patients studied had careful clinical follow-up of between 5 and 11 1/2 years from diagnosis and initiation of therapy. There was no correlation of strongly positive, positive, weakly positive, equivocal, or negative staining with survival. Cases that were LN3 negative had a median survival of 18.8 months versus a median survival of 39.4 months for all LN3-positive cases. However this difference was not statistically significant when using a log-rank test. The authors were unable to confirm that HLA-DR antigen expression, as defined by LN3, is prognostically valuable in diffuse large cell lymphoma in a multi-institutional study.\r"

  ".U": "90381639\r", 
  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody, 4F2, which reacts with an antigen expressed by activated and proliferating cells, was applied to frozen sections of nine reactive lymphoid lesions, 146 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), and six plasmacytic neoplasms. In reactive cases, the 4F2 antigen was expressed by germinal center cells and interfollicular immunoblasts, the activated or proliferating lymphoid cells, and histiocytes. In the malignant cases, the 4F2 antigen was expressed by 94 (64%) B-cell NHL and all six plasma cell tumors. The incidence of positivity and intensity of expression loosely correlated with the three morphologic grades of NHL identified in the Working Formulation. Approximately one half of all low-grade lymphomas, two thirds of intermediate-grade lymphomas, and all high-grade lymphomas were 4F2 positive. Similarly, the mean intensity of 4F2 antigen expression increased with higher grade. However, for certain histologic subtypes, 4F2 antigen expression did not correlate with morphologic grade. For example, in the intermediate-grade category less than one half of diffuse small cleaved cell lymphomas were 4F2 positive, and expression was weak, similar to that of low-grade lymphomas. In contrast, all other histologic subtypes of lymphoma in the intermediate-grade category were strongly 4F2 positive. Expression of 4F2 antigen also correlated with plasmacytoid differentiation. Seventy-three percent of plasmacytoid small lymphocytic lymphomas (compared with 31% of cases of non-plasmacytoid small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and all plasma cell neoplasms expressed the 4F2 antigen, the latter cases strongly.\r"

There was a significant difference (P = 0.0001) in distribution of stem-line karyotype (normal, hypodiploid, pseudodiploid, or hyperdiploid) among children with early pre-B, pre-B, or T-cell ALL, with early pre-B patients demonstrating a higher proportion of hyperdiploid karyotypes with modal chromosome numbers greater than 51. Cytogenetic classification of 1216 patients with early pre-B or pre-B ALL evaluable for duration of event-free survival (EFS), with median follow-up of 42 months, showed a significant prolongation of five-year EFS associated with hyperdiploidy greater than 51 (75%; standard error [SE] = 5%) compared with hyperdiploidy 47 to 51 (46%; SE = 7%), hypodiploidy (55%; SE = 11%), and pseudodiploidy (45%; SE = 7%) (P = 0.0001). Five-year EFS was intermediate for patients with normal (58%), constitutionally abnormal (66%), or unsuccessful analyses (66%). The breakpoint defining hyperdiploidy associated with better prognosis was best defined as greater than 51 (P = 0.0002). Of 239 children with hyperdiploid karyotypes, analysis of the contribution of each chromosome to EFS duration showed a significant association between improved EFS and additional chromosome(s) six (P = 0.02). Chromosome translocation was associated with shorter EFS (P = 0.0001).\r"

The median age was 60.5 years and the male:female ratio was 1.5:1. The most common site of involvement was Waldeyer's ring, followed by the oral cavity, thyroid gland, paranasal sinuses, nasal cavity, and larynx. Seventy-five percent of the patients were in Stage I or Stage II at admission. Histologically, diffuse lymphoma accounted for 94% and follicular lymphoma for 6% of cases. The histologic grade according to the Working Formulation System of the National Cancer Institute was low in 11%, intermediate in 75%, and high in 14% of cases. Immunohistochemical study showed that the majority of the cases were of B-cell type and only 13 cases (11%) were of the T-cell type. Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (eight cases) mainly occurred in the nasopharynx and nasal cavity, whereas four of five thymic T-cell lymphomas were found in the palatine tonsil. The over-all 5-year survival rate was 54%, and the factors affecting survival were sex, histologic grade, T/B phenotype, clinical stage, and the site of initial presentation. Five-year survival with nasal cavity and Waldeyer's ring lymphoma was 24% and 46%, respectively. The poor prognosis of lymphomas at these sites might result from the predominance of T-cell lymphoma, the paucity of low grade lymphoma, and the relatively high incidence of cases that were in an advanced stage at presentation. In Stage II, patients treated with combined therapy tended to have a better 5-year survival rate than those treated with radiotherapy alone.\r"

  ".U": "90381646\r", 
  ".W": "In oligodendroglial tumors the intermediate filament glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) may be expressed by cells with the morphologic characteristics of typical oligodendrocytes (gliofibrillary oligodendrocytes [GFOC]) and by miniature forms of gemistocytes (minigemistocytes) as well. These latter cell types have been regarded as transitional cells that represent intermediate forms between an oligodendroglial and an astrocytic phenotype. Furthermore, in oligodendrogliomas GFAP may be expressed by intermingled classic large gemistocytes, which are not considered transitional cells. In a retrospective study of 111 oligodendrogliomas, the presence of the various GFAP-positive cell types was correlated with the survival rates of the patients. Therefore, GFAP expression was visualized with the use of an indirect conjugated peroxidase method. The survival times of the patients were recorded and statistical comparisons were made. The percentage of GFAP-positive tumor cells is increased in oligodendrogliomas of 28 patients who underwent a second biopsy (all these patients had been treated with radiation therapy as well). It was found that neither the presence of GFOC nor that of minigemistocytes is predictive of the survival. In contrast, patients with classic gemistocytes had survival lengths approximately twice as short as those of patients who did not have these cells in their tumors. No clear correlation was found between tumor grading or any of the individual histopathologic features with the presence of the various GFAP-positive cell types. The ominous sign of the presence of gemistocytes in oligodendrogliomas confirms some earlier reports about the prognostic significance of this cell type in astrocytomas.\r"

A final concentration of 25% ethanol was found to be the most effective preservative of several tested. After incubation with the MoAb DU83.21 and propidium iodide (DNA stain), the T24 cells could be separated from the BC cells, permitting accurate DNA analysis of the tumor cells. Application of this system to specimens from bladder cancer patients enhanced the detection and DNA analysis of the tumor cell populations.\r"

Forty consecutive malnourished patients with advanced non-hormone-responsive tumors receiving no antineoplastic treatment were randomized to receive MA 480 mg/day versus placebo for 7 days. During day 8, a cross-over was made until day 15. Appetite, pain, nausea, depression, energy, and well-being were assessed with a visual analog scale (0 to 100 mm) at 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM during days 6, 7, 13, and 14. Weight (W;kg), tricep skinfold (TS; mm), arm circumference (AC; cm), and calf circumference (CC; cm) were measured at days 1, 8, and 15. Caloric intake (CI; Kcal/day) was determined during days 6, 7, 13, and 14. In 31 evaluable patients, the percentual difference in appetite at 9:00 AM, appetite at 4:00 PM, energy, and well-being after MA was +15.1, +14, +3.2, and +5.2, versus -12 (P = 0.03), -5.1 (P = 0.015), -10 (P = 0.024), and -8.3 (not significant) after placebo. Percentual difference in W, TS, AC, and CC after MA was +0.2, +1, -0.1, and +0.4 versus -0.8 (P = 0.03), -0.8 (P = 0.001), -0.3 (not significant), and -0.5 (P = 0.04) after placebo. CI during MA was 3480 +/- 1574 (48-hour intake), versus 2793 +/- 1542 (P less than 0.001) during placebo. Patients and investigators blindly chose MA in 20 (66%, P = 0.023) and 28 cases (92%, P less than 0.001), placebo in eight and two cases, and made no choice in three and one cases, respectively. Toxicity consisted of mild edema and nausea in three and two cases, respectively. After mean follow-up of 27 +/- 13 days, on an open basis, an average increase in W and AC of 4.8 +/- 1.7 kg and 2.8 +/- 1.7 cm was observed, respectively. The authors conclude that MA is a powerful appetite stimulant with subjective and objective effects on nutritional status.\r"

However, one of the most important prognostic indicators for breast cancer is the presence of neoplastic cells in the axillary lymph nodes. The dissemination of cells from a primary lesion, resulting in the progressive growth of metastatic carcinoma in distant sites (including bone, lungs, liver, and brain) is the most common cause of death in breast cancer patients. Experimental studies on the biology of metastatic breast cancer have used rodent tumor systems, and, in recent years, the transplantation of human breast carcinoma cells into athymic mice. The results of such studies, combined with clinical observations, suggest that metastasis is not a random event. The formation of secondary lesions is the result of a sequence of selective events. A better understanding of the metastatic phenotype from cellular and molecular analyses will provide a basis for rational approaches to preventing and treating this most lethal aspect of breast cancer.\r"

Case-control studies carried out in several countries showed no real association between fat intake and breast cancer. There is some evidence that vitamin A or carotenoid intake may exert a protective effect. Alcohol intake, on the other hand, seems to be positively associated with breast cancer risk. Elevated body weight, body mass, stature, and frame size have been found to be associated as risk factors for breast cancer in women. Animal studies found that caloric restriction inhibits growth of spontaneous and induced mammary tumors, an observation that held up even when the calorie-restricted animals ingest more fat than the ad-libitum-fed controls. College women who exercise have a lower incidence of breast cancer than their more sedentary classmates. Exercise is another means of reducing caloric availability.\r"

  ".W": "Epithelial hyperplasia of the breast carries an increased likelihood of carcinoma development, with most lesions best understood as markers of higher risk. The indication of increased cancer risk for more worrisome or complex histologic patterns has been supported in many studies. About 25% of women who underwent biopsies in the premammographic era had well-developed hyperplastic changes associated with an elevated risk of 1.5 to 2.0 times that of the general population when age and length of time of follow-up were considered. Somewhat fewer than 5% of women had specific patterns of atypical hyperplasia (AH) that approached the criteria of carcinoma in situ (CIS). These women with AH had a risk of cancer four to five times that of the general population, or about one half the risk associated with microscopic CIS. Only ductal CIS should be considered without question to be an intrinsic precancerous lesion because of its regular association with recurrence at the site of its initial diagnosis. Further studies indicated an appreciable interaction between AH and other nonanatomic risk factors, particularly a family history of breast cancer. Also, lower dosage estrogen replacement after menopause does not affect risk in any histologically defined group. The atypical hyperplastic lesions are more common in women undergoing biopsies on the indication of mammographic calcifications than because of palpable masses. The primary therapeutic implications of these premalignant lesions are intensified breast cancer surveillance and screening for these patients.\r"

A biopsy should be performed on a clinically suspicious mass whether the mammogram is suspicious or not. Management of the patient with a nonpalpable mammographic abnormality requires a close working relationship among the surgeon, pathologist, and radiologist. Thoughtful clinical judgement and interdisciplinary cooperation promote an acceptable benign to malignant ratio for breast biopsies.\r"

Widely publicized screening and follow-up recommendations are often the source of the grievances. Even when recommendations are followed exactly, bad outcomes are still associated with incurable cancer even though a fatal outcome is inevitable. Patients must be told about treatment prospects including limitations of efficacy, so that patient expectations will be realistic. Otherwise, practitioners may find themselves involved in lawsuits alleging deviation from case standards for an adverse outcome actually attributable to the nature of the cancer. Because screening and follow-up techniques continue to control treatment of breast cancer, such lawsuits are common. When ineffective treatment exists, there often are adverse harm/benefit considerations and high costs, particularly when screening or follow-up are practiced defensively, without hard data proving the value of a strategy. This article will review these problems, placing specific emphases on screening and follow-up procedures and on strategies for breast cancer. Factors that limit efficacy and increase both cost and diagnosis-associated morbidity will also be explored.\r"

  ".W": "Combined modality trials in early breast cancer have been underway since the 1960s and results are available to indicate varying degrees of success in Stage I and II. The trials have involved more than 29,000 women in 61 randomized trials. The recommendations can be summarized by stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and menopausal status. In Stage II patients, chemotherapy has an impact on disease mortality for ER-positive and ER-negative premenopausal women and possibly ER-negative postmenopausal patients. In postmenopausal Stage II ER-positive patients, tamoxifen given for more than 2 years has a beneficial effect on survival. In node-negative patients, the major effects have been on improving disease-free survival (DFS) rather than overall survival. Tamoxifen has a positive effect in ER-positive patients while chemotherapy benefits ER-negative patients. In at least one trial chemotherapy benefitted women with ER-positive tumors, both premenopausal and postmenopausal, with lesions larger than 3.0 cm. Ongoing trials are designed to answer questions regarding optimal therapy for varying subsets including those tumors in which ER cannot be measured. New prognostic features used to determine therapy include flow cytometry studies of DNA synthesis and oncogene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The definition of locally advanced breast cancer includes patients with large tumors, extensive regional lymph node involvement, or direct involvement of the skin or underlying chest wall. Most of these patients have very poor survival with standard treatment modalities, and over the past 20 years combined modality therapy has been used to improve local and systemic control. There is limited information suggesting that patients with operable locally advanced breast cancer have an improved survival if treated with surgery (or radiation therapy) followed by systemic chemotherapy, as compared with patients treated with local modalities alone. Uncontrolled trials strongly suggest that patients with any stage of locally advanced breast cancer achieve high response rates after induction chemotherapy. Most of these patients can be rendered disease free after combined modality therapy, and their disease-free and overall survival rates appear to be improved when compared with historical controls. These results are most impressive for patients with inflammatory breast cancer, a disease previously found to be uniformly lethal when treated with local modalities of therapy alone. More recently, 30% to 50% of these patients were alive and disease free 5 years after diagnosis, and a substantial percentage were in the same condition 10 years later. Combined modality therapies are the most appropriate approach to patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Much additional research must be done to improve the results of these therapies and maximize the survival of patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\r"

More choices are available for local control and indications for systemic adjuvant therapy have changed dramatically. Knowledge of predictable physical and psychological responses through the various phases of primary treatment is the first critical element for the rehabilitation of these oncology patients. The health care provider can then anticipate problems, prepare the patient with accurate information, and institute interventions early to minimize symptoms. Information and psychological needs dominate the diagnostic phase, during which communication and emotional support are of paramount importance for decision making. Psychological distress persists through the treatment phase regardless of the choice of mastectomy or breast conservation surgery with radiation. The physical symptoms of these choices are similar, primarily related to the axillary lymph node dissection. Fatigue, breast soreness, sensation, and skin changes are common symptoms with breast irradiation that resolve over time. Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hair loss, menopausal symptoms, and weight gain are predictable chemotherapy-related side effects and are reported as mild to moderately distressful by the majority of patients. Consistency of information, support, collaboration, coordination of care, and communication among patients and health care providers are essential to meet the challenge of successful treatment and rehabilitation.\r"

This article has reviewed components of quality of life specific to women with advanced breast cancer following two clinical courses:those who develop a recurrence and those who present with advanced disease. It is clear that additional research is warranted on the quality of life in women with advanced breast cancer. Work to date has clearly indicated that the management of women with advanced disease requires the resources available from a multidisciplinary perspective. Efforts to manage advanced breast cancer must include both current medical therapies and attention to the critical factors associated with enhancing the quality of their lives. Of final concern is the relationship of social class to advanced disease. Following Freeman's recent outline of the agenda for the American Cancer Society, more attention must be given to people who are economically disadvantaged because cancer incidence and mortality are greater among poor people than among the affluent. It is possible that over 50% of women presenting with advanced cancer of the breast are economically disadvantaged. Validation of this problem through research should lead to prevention programs targeted to this population. Women with breast cancer who are economically disadvantaged may be particularly receptive to interventions that will enhance their quality of life.\r"

The diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer constitutes an immediate confrontation with mortality, and sympathetic but direct examination of the patient's vulnerability and means of coping with it will reduce rather than amplify death anxiety. The development and pursuit of realistic goals influenced by the prognosis can help patients adjust constructively. Extremes of emotion are to be expected at times, but persistent depression and/or anxiety should be vigorously treated, including the use of appropriate psychoactive medication when the symptoms are primarily somatic (e.g., sleep disturbance and reductions in energy). Physical symptoms such as pain, nausea, and vomiting can be controlled by teaching patients such techniques as self-hypnosis, biofeedback, and systemic desensitization. Finally, a feeling of social isolation is the rule, not the exception, with cancer patients. Group and family treatment can effectively counter this. Systematic studies of such treatment interventions have shown favorable results, including significant reductions in mood disturbance and pain.\r"

Since that time, additional data have become available regarding the use of this approach and its comparability to mastectomy. In general, these data support the use of CS and RT and, as a result, this approach is now more widely employed in the United States and abroad than it was in 1984. The current focus of inquiry has shifted from whether or not CS and RT is an acceptable option for patients with early stage breast cancer to the following questions. For which patients are CS and RT suitable? What are the best techniques of surgery and RT? Are there any patients who can be treated safely with CS without RT? How should RT and systemic therapy be integrated when both are to be used? In this report, recent results on the use of CS and RT from both retrospective and prospective trials are summarized, and these current areas of inquiry are addressed.\r"

  ".W": "The management of patients with metastatic breast cancer is best achieved by the judicious use of local and systemic measures that palliate symptoms and improve overall quality of life. When two treatment approaches are known to be equally efficacious, the less toxic should be used. When disease is limited to one or two sites and the patient has an indolent form of the disease, the patient's symptoms are often best palliated with the use of surgery or radiotherapy alone. When multiple sites of disease are evident or the disease is progressing more rapidly, systemic therapy is preferred, and local therapies should be added when the patient is clearly refractory to systemic therapy or when the disease site is unlikely to be adequately palliated with systemic therapy. The use of any of these therapies, including chemotherapy, has a relatively small effect on the median survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, improvements in quality of life are usually greatest with regimens inducing the highest response rates, even when these regimens are associated with greater toxicity. The characteristics of patients likely to respond to endocrine therapy are well defined; in these patients endocrine therapy should be used as the first form of systemic therapy. Among endocrine therapies, the least toxic is used first. The selection of patients for chemotherapy is largely a process of exclusion. When chemotherapy is used, there are a number of different strategies for sequencing chemotherapy that appear to be equally efficacious. In general, patients should be treated with standard doses of drug combinations for a period in excess of 3 months. When used inappropriately, especially in asymptomatic patients, these therapies may actually compromise the patient's quality of life. The use of surgery, radiation therapy, and systemic therapy should be integrated with various types of psychosupport services, especially peer support groups. Patients who want to try new forms of therapy should do so early in the course of the disease when these therapies are most likely to be effective and the patient has the least to lose if the therapy proves ineffective. This is especially true because the use of the most effective regimens at a time when the patient is asymptomatic may mean that the patient is resistant to most or all therapies of proven value when most in need of palliation.\r"

Previously, the rate of cardiac stimulation had been determined either at pacemaker manufacture, by programming a single rate, or by sensing the atrium. More recently, sensing another physiological or nonphysiological function that changes in response to body need has become possible. Exercise changes blood oxygen saturation, central venous pH, central venous temperature, minute ventilation and respiratory rate, stroke volume, circulating catecholamines, QT interval, evoked endocardial response to a stimulus, and the mechanics of myocardial contraction. Some sensors respond to muscle work but not to intellectual effort or emotion. Pacemaker-based sensors of physiological function or activity allow a change in cardiac stimulation rate in response to need. Whichever sensor is used, increases in ventricular rate during exercise regularly produce a cardiac output response. Single-chamber, rate-modulated pacemakers in atrium or ventricle and dual-chamber devices are now implanted on a widespread basis. These drive the atrium, the ventricle, or both, sensing or pacing the atrium at a rate determined by the sensor.\r"

  ".W": "Because individual studies evaluating the role of quinidine in the maintenance of sinus rhythm after cardioversion from chronic atrial fibrillation have involved relatively few patients, a meta-analysis of randomized control trials was performed. Six trials published between 1970 and 1984 were selected by two blinded reviewers based on study design and statistical analysis. Data from these six trials involving 808 patients were pooled after testing for homogeneity of treatment effects across trials. Life table estimates of the percent of patients still in sinus rhythm at 3, 6, and 12 months after cardioversion were constructed for quinidine and control groups. The proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm in the quinidine group was 69%, 58%, and 50% at 3, 6, and 12 months postcardioversion respectively. The proportion of patients remaining in sinus rhythm in the control group was 45%, 33%, and 25% at the same time intervals. The pooled rate difference, or difference in proportion of patients in sinus rhythm between quinidine and control groups, was 24%, 23%, and 24% at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up (p less than 0.001 at all time intervals). The unadjusted total mortality rate in the quinidine-treated patients was 2.9% and in the control group was 0.8%. The odds of dying in the quinidine-treated group were approximately three times that of the control group (\"typical\" odds ratio = 2.98, p less than 0.05). Thus, quinidine treatment is more effective than no antiarrhythmic therapy in suppressing recurrences of atrial fibrillation but appears to be associated with increased total mortality.\r"

We conducted an open-label prospective study of nine patients (seven men and two women; age, 18-64 years; mean age, 41.7 +/- 13.7 years). Patients were treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) to prevent recurrences. All patients had suffered at least three relapses despite treatment with acetylsalicylic acid, indomethacin, prednisone, or a combination. Pericarditis was classified as idiopathic in five patients, postpericardiotomy in two, post-myocardial infarction in one, and associated with disseminated lupus erythematosus in one. For statistical analysis, we conducted a paired comparison design (Student's t test). All patients treated with colchicine responded favorably to therapy. Prednisone was discontinued in all patients after 2-6 weeks (mean, 26.33 +/- 10.9 days), and colchicine alone was continued. After a mean follow-up of 24.3 months (minimum, 10 months; maximum, 54 months), no recurrences were observed in any patient; there was a significant difference between the symptom-free periods before and after treatment with colchicine (p less than 0.002). Our study suggests that colchicine may be useful in avoiding recurrence of pericarditis, although these results need to be confirmed in a larger, double-blind study.\r"

Transesophageal color Doppler flow imaging detected mitral regurgitation in all 32 patients proved to have this lesion. In 10 of 16 patients without mitral regurgitation by angiography, mitral regurgitation signals were detected by transesophageal color Doppler flow imaging. Thus, the sensitivity and specificity of transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography for the detection of mitral regurgitation were 100% and 38%, respectively. There was some correlation between the regurgitant jet area from the longitudinal plane and angiographic grading. An improved angiographic correlation was achieved with the regurgitant jet area from the transverse plane. The best correlation with angiography was obtained when the maximum regurgitant jet area from two planes (the greater of the two measurements, each from a different plane) was considered. There was a significant difference in the maximum regurgitant jet area between none and mild (p less than 0.01), mild and moderate (p less than 0.001), and moderate and severe (p less than 0.01) mitral regurgitation. The maximum regurgitant jet area of less than 1.5 cm2 predicted the angiographic grading as none with a sensitivity and specificity of 88% and 94%, respectively. The maximum regurgitant jet of between 1.5 and 4 cm2 predicted the angiographic grading as mild with a sensitivity and specificity of 82% and 95%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the consistency, strength, and independence of the relation of carotid atherosclerosis to coronary atherosclerosis, we quantified coronary artery disease risk factors and extent of carotid atherosclerosis (B-mode score) in 343 coronary artery disease patients and 167 disease-free control patients. In univariable analyses, there was a strong association between coronary status and extent of carotid artery disease in men and women older than and younger than 50 years (p less than 0.001 for men and women greater than 50 years, p less than 0.001 for women less than or equal to 50 years, p = 0.045 for men less than or equal to 50). The relation remained strong after control for age in men and women older than 50 years and in women younger than 50 (p less than 0.001 for men and women greater than 50 years, p = 0.003 for women less than or equal to 50) but did not persist after control for age in men younger than 50. Logistic models that included coronary disease risk factors, with or without B-mode score, as independent variables and presence or absence of coronary disease as the outcome variable indicated that the extent of carotid atherosclerosis was a strong, statistically significant independent variable in models for men and women older than 50 years of age. Next, we examined the usefulness of B-mode score as an aid in screening for coronary artery disease in men and women older than 50 years. Classification rules, both including and excluding B-mode score, were developed based on logistic regression and, for comparison, recursive partitioning (decision trees). The performance of these rules and the bias of their performance statistics were estimated. The improved classification of the study sample when B-mode score was incorporated in the rule was statistically significant only for men (p = 0.015). However, the addition of B-mode score was found to 1) increase the median discrimination score for both sex groups based on the logistic model, and 2) yield better sensitivities and specificities for rules based on recursive partitioning. Thus B-mode score is strongly, consistently, and independently associated with coronary artery disease in patients older than 50 and is at least as useful as well-known risk factors for identifying patients with coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".U": "90381884\r", 
  ".W": "A novel approach was developed allowing the measurement of steady-state force and intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in tetanized human ventricular trabeculae carneae without pharmacological intervention. We compared and contrasted three methods of assessing calcium sensitivity of the myofilaments: 1) force-[Ca2+] relations in skinned fiber preparations, 2) peak twitch force-peak [Ca2+]i relations, and 3) steady-state force-[Ca2+]i relations in intact muscles. Steady-state contractile activation was achieved rapidly by tetanizing intact human trabeculae, loaded with aequorin, a Ca2(+)-sensitive bioluminescent protein, at a stimulation frequency of 15-20 Hz. Steady-state force and [Ca2+]i were measured during tetani, and the force versus [Ca2+]i relation was obtained by varying the extracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]o). Force-[Ca2+]i relations obtained from control and myopathic hearts were fitted to the Hill equation: %Force = [Ca2+]inh/([Ca2+]inh50% + [Ca2+]inh), where nh is the Hill coefficient, and [Ca2+]50% is the [Ca2+] required for 50% activation. The curves of tetani had Hill coefficients of 5.21 +/- 0.20 (n = 6) and 5.61 +/- 0.60 (n = 10) and [Ca2+]50% of 0.56 +/- 0.05 microM (n = 6) and 0.54 +/- 0.09 microM (n = 10) in control and myopathic muscles, respectively. We also constructed peak force-peak [Ca2+]i relations using isometric twitches from the same muscles. These curves were shifted toward higher [Ca2+]i compared with the steady-state force-[Ca2+]i curve derived from tetani. Ryanodine (1 microM), which increased the time course of the Ca2+ and force transients, shifted the peak force-peak [Ca2+]i relation to the left, without affecting the steady-state force-[Ca2+]i relation. Exposure to 10 mM caffeine shifted the steady-state force-[Ca2+]i relation to the left, whereas exposure to 3 microM isoproterenol shifted this relation to the right. Experiments using skinned fiber preparations were performed in parallel with experiments on intact muscles from the same hearts. The force-pCa (-log[Ca2+]) relations in saponin-skinned trabeculae from control and myopathic tissue were superimposable. Ryanodine (1 microM) had no effect on the force-pCa relation in skinned fibers. Maximal tension was evoked by the posttetanic twitch, which was larger than the tetanus. This potentiation was abolished in the presence of ryanodine, a sarcoplasmic reticulum inhibitor. We propose that the changes in the steady-state force-[Ca2+]i relations are correlated with alterations in the sensitivity of the myofilaments to Ca2+, whereas changes in the peak force-peak [Ca2+]i relations represent temporal changes in the twitch transient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The multicenter randomized study of the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico has provided the opportunity to analyze the impact of thrombolytic treatment on secondary ventricular fibrillation incidence in a large population of patients (11,712) with acute myocardial infarction. A reduction of about 20% in the frequency of secondary ventricular fibrillation was observed among patients allocated to thrombolytic treatment (streptokinase, 2.4% versus control, 2.9%; relative risk, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.00). Streptokinase appeared to exert its protective effect specifically in patients treated within 3 hours of onset of symptoms (streptokinase, 2.6% versus control, 3.7%; relative risk, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.95). This protection was essentially due to a reduced incidence of late ventricular fibrillation occurring after the first day of hospitalization. The 311 patients with secondary ventricular fibrillation represented an overall incidence of 2.7%. Such incidence was not related to infarct location or sex but was significantly more common in patients older than 65 years (3.3% versus 2.3% in younger patients). A significant excess of in-hospital deaths was found in patients with secondary ventricular fibrillation compared with those in the reference group (38% versus 24%; relative risk, 1.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-2.52). Conversely, secondary ventricular fibrillation was not a predictor of 1-year mortality for hospital survivors. Thrombolytic treatment with intravenous streptokinase affords protection against secondary ventricular fibrillation most probably by a limitation of infarct size. When the arrhythmia complicates the course of infarction, it is associated with an adverse short-term outcome, whereas the long-term prognosis is not influenced.\r"

  ".U": "90381899\r", 
  ".W": "Regional intraventricular pressure gradients exist in the left ventricle (LV) during both the early and late filling phases of diastole. These regional pressure gradients comprise a fundamental component of the mechanism of normal LV filling. To determine whether similar diastolic pressure gradients also occur in the right ventricle (RV), we measured right atrial (RA) and RV regional pressures with use of micromanometers in six anesthetized, closed-chest dogs. Tricuspid flow velocity was recorded with use of transesophageal Doppler echocardiography, and right ventriculograms were obtained with contrast angiography. As in the LV, the maximum RA-RV pressure gradient during early diastole was consistently greater if RV pressure was measured near the apex than in the inflow tract (1.6 +/- 0.5 versus 0.8 +/- 0.4 mm Hg). The area of reversed pressure was also found to be significantly greater in the apex than in the inflow tract (72 +/- 43 versus 8 +/- 6 mm Hg.msec). However, unlike the LV, the lowest minimum pressure was usually recorded in the RV outflow tract, resulting in a significantly increased RA-RV outflow tract pressure gradient compared with the RA-RV apex pressure gradient (2.5 +/- 0.8 versus 1.6 +/- 0.5 mm Hg). Analysis of right ventriculograms indicates marked narrowing of the RV outflow tract at end systole in all six animals, suggesting that an end-systolic deformation in this region is the likely mechanism for production of low early diastolic pressure in this region. During atrial contraction the RV regional pressure gradient pattern was similar to the LV pattern: the RV a-wave ascent occurred earlier in the inflow tract and later in the apex. A-wave ascent appeared to occur almost simultaneously in the apex and outflow tract. In the six animals, Doppler-derived peak tricuspid flow velocity during early diastole was 35 +/- 6 cm/sec. Early tricuspid flow acceleration (393 +/- 101 cm/sec2) was found to be significantly greater than deceleration of flow (182 +/- 59 cm/sec2). Comparison of tricuspid pressure-flow data with mitral pressure-flow data previously obtained in our laboratory indicates that the driving pressure gradient across the tricuspid valve is significantly less than across the mitral. This pressure difference corresponds to differences in acceleration and peak flow found across the two valves. Consideration of these physiological patterns of RV diastolic intraventricular pressure and their relation to filling has important implications with regard to the development of indexes that characterize diastolic pressure-flow relations and provides physiological insight relating to the location of ventricular restoring forces.\r"

The relationship between exercise and symptomatic/functional status has been unclear. We developed quantitative measures of quality-of-life variables and examined their relationship with exercise capacity. There were significant relationships between change in exercise duration and changes in breathlessness, tiredness, chest pain, walking difficulty, rate of walking, difficulty with daily tasks, speed of daily tasks, mood, and sleeping. This study confirms the validity of measuring change in exercise capacity and demonstrates that specific measurements of quality of life make an important contribution to the evaluation of the treatment of heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "90382027\r", 
  ".W": "1. My aim was to investigate, by mathematical simulation, the errors inherent in the measurement by the primed infusion method of the rate of appearance of glucose in man when turnover was as low or lower than in overnight-fasted normal subjects (control subjects). The simulations were based on published data for means and variances of turnover rates and concentrations in nondiabetic subjects and diabetic patients. 2. Systematic errors (bias) were shown to be considerable whether or not the Steele equation was used, unless run-times were longer than is customary. Errors were greater the lower the turnover rate, and were greatest in patients with diabetes, owing to insulin resistance. Studies of, for example, control subjects, age, obesity, exercise, sepsis and injury, are, however, all likely to be affected. 3. Estimates of variance, within-group means, between-group differences and slopes of rate-concentration relationships were all biased. Entirely spurious results appeared statistically significant. 4. When the Steele equation was not used, run-times had to exceed 3 h in control subjects and 10 h in some diabetic patients to reduce bias to acceptable levels. The nature of the bias depended on how the priming dose/infusion rate ratio was chosen. Each choice implies a particular hypothesis about the values of the rate of appearance of glucose, their variance, and how they are related to concentration. The bias was always such as to favour that hypothesis. 5. When the Steele equation was used, the accessible glucose space (pool fraction x distribution volume) had to be correct to 20-30 ml to avoid unacceptable bias in some patients in runs 4 h long. The space is not known this accurately. Theoretically, in the near-steady metabolic states considered, the pool fraction should be near 1.00, i.e. the accessible space should be near the glucose distribution volume of 200-300 mg/kg. There is some confirmatory experimental evidence. 6. Large random errors from variance of specific (radio)activity measurements when the Steele equation is used can be reduced by a suitable choice of protocols. 7. The propagation of errors is too complex to permit correction of results. It is essential to choose protocols that can be shown to give results that are acceptably bias-free. Ways of doing this are discussed.\r"

A low concentration of endothelin (60 pmol/l) produced a gradual but sustained increase in cardiac output; coronary vascular resistance was unaffected. 3. A high concentration of endothelin (600 pmol/l) produced a rapid increase in cardiac output, followed by a marked fall in cardiac output as progressive, severe coronary vasoconstriction developed. 4. The coronary vasoconstriction induced by endothelin (600 pmol/l) was partially blocked by nicardipine (0.5 mumol/l). 5. In the presence of either nicardipine (0.5 mumol/l) or verapamil (0.2 mumol/l), the increment in cardiac output induced by endothelin (600 pmol/l) was greater than that induced by the addition of the same concentration of endothelin to hearts which had not been exposed to calcium-entry blockers. 6. The effect of endothelin on myocardial contractility has a different time course, concentration dependence and response to calcium-entry blockade than the effect on the coronary vasculature. This suggests that different mechanisms are involved in the generation of the myocardial and vascular responses to endothelin.\r"

  ".W": "Previous work indicates that a serum form of the insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/Man-6-P) receptor that circulates in mammals is a truncated form of the cellular receptor which lacks its cytoplasmic domain. In this study the effects of insulin administration on the levels of the serum forms of IGF-II/Man-6-P and transferrin receptors were measured. After sc injection of insulin into rats fasted overnight, the amount of IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor in serum increases to approximately twice that observed in untreated animals within 30 min, then decreases to a level lower than the initial level by 60 min before returning to control values by 90 min. The time course of the initial increase in serum receptor levels in response to insulin is similar to that observed for the decrease in blood glucose concentrations. Measurements of serum enzyme activities (creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase) during this time show no significant increase in response to insulin treatment. Furthermore, the increase in serum IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors is proportional to the amount of insulin injected over the range tested. In diabetic rats the serum IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor concentration is decreased to approximately 80% as much serum receptor as that in normal age-matched rats. The acute response of serum IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor levels to insulin administration is similar in both time course and extent of change to the increase in isolated fat cells of cell surface receptor levels due to insulin action. These results suggest the hypothesis that insulin stimulates the movement of cellular IGF-II/Man-6-P receptors to the cell surface, where they are proteolytically cleaved and released into serum.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed ad libitum and additionally infused with Intralipid 10%, 1.0 ml/h. After 3 h of Intralipid the response to 27 mM glucose in isolated perfused pancreas was enhanced by 86%, P less than 0.02. After 6 h of Intralipid enhancement had subsided. After 48 h of Intralipid glucose-induced insulin release was inhibited by 49%, from 1950 +/- 177 microU/min after saline to 1003 +/- 232 microU/min after Intralipid, P less than 0.02. Inhibition was glucose-selective since responses to other secretagogues (1 mM 3-isobutyl-1 methylxanthine, 10 mM octanoate, or 5 mM alpha-ketoisocaproic acid) were unaffected as were pancreatic contents of insulin (2284 +/- 111 mU/pancreas after saline, 2566 +/- 131 mU/pancreas after Intralipid). In isolated islets from 48 h lipid infused rats production of [14-C]CO2 from D[U-14-C]glucose was decreased (P less than 0.02) in parallel with the insulin response to 27 mM glucose. Glucose-induced secretion was partially normalized by in vitro exposure to a carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I inhibitor (Etomoxir). Effects of a 48 h lipid infusion were also tested during hyperglycemia. Rats were infused with glucose, and hyperglycemia was enhanced by dexamethasone (25 micrograms/24 h). Hyperglycemia depressed glucose-induced secretion from perfused pancreas from 2072 +/- 22 microU/min after saline + dexamethasone to 1185 +/- 155 microU/min after glucose + dexamethasone, P less than 0.01). Intralipid, added to the latter protocol, further inhibited glucose-induced secretion to 437 +/- 87 microU/min, P less than 0.005. Hyperlipidemia is concluded to be associated with short term stimulation but long term inhibition of glucose-induced insulin secretion. Evidence indicates that inhibition depends on fatty acid oxidation, is coupled to decreased glucose oxidation and operates both during normo- and hyperglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "HIT cells have been widely used to study synthesis and secretion of insulin. It has been assumed that this cell line secretes no other islet hormones. To ascertain whether HIT cells synthesize, secrete, and degrade glucagon, we examined cell extracts for this peptide and compared secretion and degradation of glucagon and insulin during stimulation of the cells by arginine. Glucagon levels in acid extracts of HIT cells were found to be 0.72 +/- 0.15 pmol/mg protein. Both glucagon and insulin were maximally stimulated in a glucagon/insulin molar ratio of 0.029 by arginine concentrations of 25-50 nM, and the concentration of arginine that provided half-maximum responses for both hormones was approximately 3 mM. Diminution of arginine-induced glucagon secretion was caused by somatostatin, a physiological inhibitor of pancreatic islet alpha-cell function. HPLC was used to authenticate the glucagon levels stimulated by arginine for 60 min and measured by RIA. Thirty-six percent of immunoreactive glucagon was found in the fractions representing authentic glucagon, whereas the remaining 64% eluted earlier. Experiments examining the fate of radiolabeled glucagon exposed to HIT cells revealed time-dependent degradation of the radioisotope to earlier eluting forms, which accounted for approximately 50% of the radioactivity by 60 min and was complete by 18 h, indicating that the early peak detected by RIA represented a metabolite of glucagon. Radioisotopic insulin was degraded more slowly with an apparent half-life of approximately 36 h. We conclude that HIT cells are not only able to synthesize, secrete, and degrade insulin, but also much smaller amounts of glucagon.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoid effects on insulin biosynthesis and secretion have been controversial. To define whether glucocorticoids affect insulin biosynthesis in vitro, the actions of dexamethasone on insulin gene expression were examined using the HIT cell line, a transformed clonal line of hamster beta-cells. Dexamethasone induced a dose-dependent decrease in steady-state insulin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, which was prevented by adding an excess of RU 486, a competitive inhibitor for the binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. Inhibition was not observed before 6 h of dexamethasone treatment and was maximal at 24 h. To further assess the molecular mechanisms of the dexamethasone-induced decreases in insulin mRNA levels, we investigated whether transcription of the insulin gene was affected. Run-on assays revealed that transcription rates were not changed by glucocorticoids. Inhibition of RNA and protein synthesis by actinomycin D and cycloheximide, respectively, completely abolished the dexamethasone effects, whereas actinomycin D added 9 h after dexamethasone had no effect on insulin mRNA levels. The present results demonstrate that glucocorticoids can acutely inhibit insulin biosynthesis by destabilizing insulin mRNA; this effect requires the transcriptional activation of a gene encoding a protein responsible for the accelerated disappearance of insulin mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "The human liver GH receptor has been further characterized using several biochemical approaches. Crosslinking of [125 I]human GH (hGH) to microsomal receptors and to particulate and solubilized plasma membrane receptors, followed by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, revealed two predominant receptor-hormone complexes with a mol wt of 124,000 and 75,000, respectively. As previously shown, the 70-80 k band appears to be generated from the 124 k band in the presence of beta-mercaptoethanol, suggesting intersubunit disulfide linkages. A minor complex of mol wt 150,000 was sometimes found. By immunoblot, using a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide (residues 391-405 of the mature human GH receptor), a single band of 100 k was detected. Human liver GH receptor and plasma GH-binding protein (BP) were purified 1,000- and 4,000-fold, respectively. The partially purified membrane receptor, analyzed by ligand-blot, showed two major bands of 55 and 32 k and minor bands of 68 and 47 k. Crosslinking of the purified GH-BP or purified receptor with [125I]hGH revealed a 75 k receptor-hormone complex. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the hepatic GH receptor inhibited the binding of hGH to the human receptor and were able to immunoprecipitate the GH receptor and also the GH-BP complex. Our findings demonstrate the existence of multiple forms of the GH receptor in human liver (major components of 100 and 50-55 k, minor component of 130 k); they lend more support to the possible subunit structure of the GH receptor; and finally, they also suggest a close relationship, with common antigenic properties, of the membrane receptor and the plasma GH-BP.\r"

  ".W": "The induction of steroid 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase was studied in bovine adrenocortical cell cultures in serum-free medium. In the absence of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I or insulin, cholera toxin failed to increase 11 beta-hydroxylase enzyme activity or messenger RNA (mRNA) levels; cholera toxin increased 11 beta-hydroxylase activity and mRNA only in the presence of 10 nM IGF-I or of higher concentrations of insulin. 17 alpha-Hydroxylase enzyme activity and mRNA, in contrast, were increased maximally by cholera toxin in the absence of insulin or IGF. We also compared the induction of 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase by intracellular second messengers. When cultures were incubated with cholera toxin, cAMP analogs, forskolin, ACTH, or prostaglandin E1 in defined medium with insulin, all agents increased the mRNA levels for 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase. 11 beta-Hydroxylase enzyme activity was detectable in control (insulin only) cultures and was increased to varying extents by the different agents. 17 alpha-Hydroxylase enzyme activity was undetectable in control cultures and was increased more than 50-fold by all agents. We compared the sensitivity of induction of 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme activities by cAMP using serial dilutions of an equimolar mixture of N6-monobutyryl cAMP and 8-bromo cAMP. For both enzymes, the response curve was biphasic, with a maximal response in the range of 20 to 100 microM each analog, but the decline in response at higher cAMP concentrations was much more marked for 11 beta-hydroxylase than for 17 alpha-hydroxylase. The effects of activation of protein kinase C were studied in cultures incubated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) together with a cAMP analog mixture. TPA decreased cAMP-induced 11 beta-hydroxylase mRNA; TPA also decreased the induction of 17 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA, as previously reported. TPA caused a dose-dependent decrease in cAMP-induced 11 beta-hydroxylase enzyme activity. Angiotensin II at 0.1 to 10 microM also decreased induction of 11 beta-hydroxylase. Induction of 11 beta-hydroxylase and 17 alpha-hydroxylase is coordinately regulated by cAMP, protein kinase C, and IGF-I/insulin, but responses to these regulators differ in various respects between these two cytochrome P450 enzymes.\r"

First, by the demonstration of NPY-immunoreactive material of a size corresponding to the estimated mol wt of pro-NPY. Second, an antiserum specific for the C-terminal tyrosine amide of NPY and peptide YY does not react with this material. Third, it was possible to convert the pro-NPY extracted from plasma and follicular fluid using the protease, Endoproteinase-Lys C, to a NPY-immunoreactive form eluting slightly before NPY on a G-50 column. The size of the digested product was consistent with a cleavage of pro-NPY resulting in an immunoreactive species, NPY-Gly-Lys. Pro-NPY was also found in tissue culture media from the human neuroendocrine cell line SH-SY5Y. As in the case of plasma and follicular fluid, another NPY immunoreactive species eluted from a G-50 gel filtration column slightly before synthetic human NPY. Analysis of this material with an antibody directed against the tyrosine amide of NPY in combination with isoelectric focusing revealed that this peak consisted of at least two immunoreactive forms of NPY. In conclusion, at least three different forms of NPY immunoreactivity are likely to be present in plasma, follicular fluid, and cell tissue culture media; pro-NPY, a degradation form of pro-NPY, or a biosynthetic intermediate and NPY.\r"

  ".U": "90382315\r", 
  ".W": "Recent studies have shown that the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) can associate with and tyrosine-phosphorylate the gamma-isozyme of phosphoinositide (PtdIns)-specific phospholipase C (PLC gamma), suggesting a possible mechanism for activation of PtdIns hydrolysis by EGF. In the present study, the coupling between PtdIns hydrolysis and PLC gamma tyrosine phosphorylation in WB liver epithelial cells was examined. Peak levels of [P-Tyr]PLC gamma, measured by anti-P-Tyr immunoblotting, occurred at 0.5-2 min of EGF treatment and coincided with the onset of [3H]inositol phosphate production. The termination of PtdIns hydrolysis after EGF stimulation was accompanied by return of [P-Tyr]PLC gamma to near-basal levels. Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) with a phorbol ester inhibited (IC50 = 3-10 nM) both EGF-dependent PtdIns hydrolysis and PLC gamma phosphorylation by more than 90%. Both EGF-stimulated responses were potentiated in cells depleted of PKC by prolonged phorbol ester treatment. At physiological ionic strength, monoclonal antibodies to PLC gamma specifically precipitated (in addition to PLC gamma) the EGF receptor and at least six other [P-Tyr]proteins from extracts of EGF-treated cells. PKC activation had differential effects on the tyrosine phosphorylation of these coprecipitating proteins, i.e. the relative abundance of certain [P-Tyr] proteins decreased, whereas that of another protein increased. In conclusion, EGF-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma is broadly correlated with stimulation of PtdIns hydrolysis, consistent with a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in PLC activation. The attendant diacylglycerol release and activation of PKC may terminate PLC gamma activation, in part by inhibiting PLC gamma phosphorylation by the EGF receptor. Our results suggest further that PKC may exert regulatory effects by altering the relationship of PLC gamma to its associated [P-Tyr]proteins.\r"

  ".U": "90382316\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin receptors on the surface of down-regulated HepG2 cells were studied, and multiple defects of receptor function were demonstrated. Insulin treatment led to a 58% decrease in cell surface receptor number, and the remaining receptors exhibited a 50% decrease in insulin internalization and degradation on a per receptor basis. Down-regulated cells internalized 36% of receptors photolabeled with 125I-NAPA-insulin vs. 56% of labeled receptors in control cells, indicating a 40% decrease in ligand-mediated receptor internalization. Total cellular receptors purified from down-regulated cells by wheat germ affinity chromatography demonstrated a 20% decrease in maximal autophosphorylation. Assessment of autophosphorylation of cell surface receptors in intact cells by restimulation of cells with insulin at 12 C (a temperature nonpermissive for receptor recycling), followed by immunoblotting with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies revealed a decrease of approximately 70% in insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation compared with controls. This method also revealed a comparable decrease in insulin-stimulable tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185, a putative endogenous substrate. When receptors were stimulated to undergo autophosphorylation with 125I-NAPA-insulin in intact cells and then solubilized, only 11% of 125I-NAPA-insulin receptor complexes from down-regulated cells were immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies compared with 35% of labeled control receptors. These results indicate that treatment with high concentrations of insulin results in the accumulation on the cell surface of a population of receptors that display multiple functional abnormalities. This probably results from preferential internalization and degradation of kinase-competent insulin receptors causing an accumulation of kinase-incompetent receptors on the cell surface. These receptors may in part be responsible for the postbinding defects in insulin action observed in down-regulated cells.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously raised an anti-c-erb A peptide antibody (designated 4B II) which immunoprecipitated in vitro transcription/translation products of c-erb A alpha 1 and beta. 4B II could recognize nuclear T3 receptor (NT3R) without distinction between difference in species and tissues. Using 4B II, we studied immunohistochemical localization of NT3R proteins in various tissues of the rat. Cryostat sections (4-6 microns) of selected rat tissues were incubated with 4B II at 4C overnight, followed by fluorescein-isothyocianate-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G for 60 min at 25 C. The cellular localization of fluorescence in all tissues examined was exclusively nuclear. Under the same conditions, control sections stained with antiserum which had previously absorbed with c-erb A peptide or inactive serum showed no specific staining. In the brain the large nuclei, supposed to be neuronal, were strongly stained in the cerebral cortex and the granular layer of the cerebellum. In the kidney, cells in the glomerulus, the distal, but not the proximal, tubules, and the collecting ducts exhibited nuclear staining. Nuclear fluorescence was observed homogeneously in the heart and liver, but the intensity was much weaker in the latter. Less intense fluorescence was seen in the testis and spleen, although specific immunostaining was clearly observed in the nuclei of spermatocytes, Leydig cells, and the heads of the sperms in the testis, and many lymphocytes in the spleen. Nuclei of follicular cells of the thyroid exhibited very strong fluorescence, suggesting existence of plenty of NT3R proteins. The anterior pituitary showed strong immunostaining in most nuclei, and clear nuclear fluorescence was also detected in the intermediate lobe of the pituitary. The present study showed that NT3R distributes selectively in certain types of cells in many tissues and that the content of NT3R proteins seems to correlate with the concentration of c-erb A mRNA alpha 1 and beta among many organs.\r"

  ".W": "Glucocorticoids are known to have a lytic effect in leukemic cells via interactions with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Cortisol and various synthetic glucocorticoids bind to the GR with one-site kinetics. Cortivazol (CVZ) is a unique, high potency synthetic glucocorticoid, which has a phenylpyrazol fused to the A-ring of the steroid nucleus and displays binding consistent with two or more sites in the cytosol from CEM C7 cells (a human acute lymphoblastic T-cell line). It has previously been shown that the lower affinity class of sites are similar in affinity and site molarity to those recognized by dexamethasone. The higher affinity sites bind CVZ with 20- to 50-fold greater affinity, consistent with CVZ's enhanced biological effects. In mutant leukemic cells resistant to the lytic effects of dexamethasone, CVZ both lyses the cells and recognizes a single class of sites similar to the high affinity site in CEM C7 cells. We have carried out experiments to define the nature of the higher affinity CVZ binding site. We now show that: 1) CVZ has more than one binding site in a second, independent, B-cell line, IM-9; 2) the antiglucocorticoid RU 38486 is able to block both CVZ's higher and lower affinity sites; 3) all of CVZ's binding sites are on a protein immunologically indistinguishable from the human GR; and 4) freshly isolated clones of CVZ-resistant cells have lost all binding sites for CVZ. These data indicate that CVZ is recognizing two glucocorticoid binding sites on the human GR or a protein very similar to it.\r"

  ".W": "Previous works from our laboratory and others have shown that there is a PRL-like immunoreactive protein with immunological, chromatographic, and biological characteristics identical to those of pituitary PRL, and this is widely distributed in the rat central nervous system. Since pituitary PRL is important in controlling hypothalamic LHRH release, we have hypothesized that hypothalamic PRL-like immunoreactive protein might serve a similar role, that of an endogenous neuromodulator influencing hypothalamic LHRH release. To this end, we have examined the effect of PRL antiserum and normal rabbit serum on the release of immunoreactive LHRH from rat hypothalamic fragments cultured in vitro. In the first experiment, LHRH release from hypothalami of intact rats, bathed in PRL antiserum (1:200 in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer), was significantly lower than that from hypothalami bathed in normal rabbit serum (1:200 in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer) for 90 min of incubation. It was, however, possible that the PRL, immunoneutralized in the first experiment, was material that represented contamination from pituitary PRL. Therefore, we repeated the experiment using hypothalami from animals that had been hypophysectomized 2 weeks before death. Again, PRL antibody significantly inhibited the release of LHRH compared with that by hypothalami incubated in normal rabbit serum. Since testosterone is important to LHRH synthesis, a third experiment was carried out using hypothalami from hypophysectomized male rats that had been implanted sc with testosterone-containing capsules 72 h before death. By 72 h serum testosterone levels had normalized. PRL antibody added to medium containing hypothalamic explants from these animals substantially inhibited in vitro LHRH release, a pattern essentially similar to that seen in intact and hypophysectomized animals without testosterone replacement. From these studies we have concluded that hypothalamic PRL is an important neuromodulator that promotes the release of LHRH from the hypothalamus. Testosterone, at least under the experimental conditions employed, appears not to be essential in this hypothalamic PRL-LHRH interaction.\r"

  ".W": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is the precursor of a family of peptides, including an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), which share with DBI the ability to specifically displace benzodiazepines (BZD) from their receptors. BZD receptors have been found not only in the brain, but also in a variety of peripheral tissues, including the testis. To clarify the role of ODN in the testis, we have investigated the localization of ODN in the rat testis using two different cytochemical approaches: immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization. Immunocytochemical localization was achieved using rabbit antibodies developed against rat ODN. At the light microscopic level, immunostaining was exclusively located in interstitial cells; the seminiferous tubules were totally unlabeled. In the developing rat, immunostaining in the interstitial cells was first detected in an 18-day-old fetus. The immunolabeling increased as a function of age to reach a plateau at 40 days of age. The ultrastructural localization of ODN was achieved by immunogold staining. The gold particles were exclusively found in the cytoplasm of Leydig cells. HPLC analysis performed in adult rat testicular extracts revealed that immunoreactive material was detected in a peak eluted later than synthetic rat ODN. The cellular distribution of ODN was also studied by in situ hybridization using a 35S-labeled single stranded RNA probe complementary to DBI mRNA. Hybridization signal obtained at the light microscopic level was only detected over interstitial cells. The data obtained clearly indicate that in the rat, Leydig cells synthesize ODN and accumulate ODN-like immunoreactivity. Since Leydig cells have been shown to contain BZD receptors, it might be hypothesized that ODN and/or other DBI-related peptides can play a role in Leydig cell regulation.\r"

  ".W": "We hypothesized the existence of vagal arginine sensors in the liver which modulate arginine-induced pancreatic hormone secretion. The present study was carried out to examine the efferent pathways and receptor mechanisms from arginine sensors using selective vagotomies and autonomic drugs on the secretion of insulin and glucagon after ip injection of L-arginine (1 g/kg BW) in rats in an unanesthetized and unrestrained state. Hepatic vagotomy (sectioning of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve) enhanced both plasma insulin and glucagon concentrations after ip arginine more than those in sham-vagotomized (control) rats. The effect of hepatic vagotomy was blocked by adding celiac vagotomy (sectioning of the celiac branches of the vagus nerve) or by previous administration of atropine methyl nitrate (10 mg/kg BW), but not by phentolamine (1 mg/kg BW) or propranolol (2 mg/kg BW). Celiac vagotomy alone did not affect the plasma insulin concentration; however, it reduced the plasma glucagon concentration after ip arginine compared to that in sham-vagotomized rats. Administration of atropine alone did not affect plasma insulin or glucagon concentrations after ip arginine. These results suggest that celiac branches of the vagus nerve act as efferent pathways to the pancreas through a muscarinic receptor mechanism in the hepatic arginine sensor-mediated pancreatic neuroendocrine system. The physiological role of these hepatic sensors may be to prevent arginine-induced exaggerated pancreatic hormone secretion and maintain blood glucose homeostasis.\r"

  ".U": "90382356\r", 
  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) circulate in association with a family of specific binding proteins (BPs). Recently, we reported that circulating levels of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 are increased in streptozotocin-diabetic adult rats and are differentially regulated in accordance with insulin and metabolic status. Since IGF BPs appear to be important modulators of IGF bioactivity in post-natal life, we asked whether serum levels of IGF BPs also might be altered in utero when the delivery of maternal nutrients is restricted and fetal growth is impaired. Bilateral uterine artery ligation or sham surgery was performed on maternal rats on d 19 of gestation (term 21.5 d). One day after ligation (d 20), fetuses were (SGA) compared to shams (3.1 +/- 1 vs 3.7 +/- 0.2 g, p less than .02) and serum levels of glucose (70 +/- 5 vs 96 +/- 6 mg/dL, p less than .01) and insulin (62 +/- 4 vs 138 +/- 14 microU/mL) also were reduced. In contrast, serum [125I]IGF-I binding activity was markedly increased in SGA litters compared to sham (65 +/- 5% maximum binding with 2.5 microL/mL SGA serum vs 14 +/- 3% for sham serum, p less than .001), and correlated with fetal weight (r = -0.539, p less than .05) and insulin (r = -0.622, p less than .05). Ligand blotting with [125I]IGF-I revealed that serum levels of IGFBP-1 (32 K) were greater in SGA than shams, while immunoblotting with specific antiserum demonstrated that levels of IGFBP-2 (34 K), the major fetal rat IGF BP, were similar in serum from SGA and shams litters. Affinity labeling and immunoprecipitation confirmed that IGF binding activity is increased in SGA, due largely to increased availability of IGFBP-1. In addition, Northern analysis of hepatic RNA revealed that the abundance of IGFBP-1 mRNA is increased in the SGA fetal rat, while hepatic mRNA for IGFBP-2 is similar in SGA and sham-operated litters. We conclude that circulating levels of IGFBP-1 and the abundance of hepatic mRNA are increased in the SGA fetal rat. IGFBP-1 may be an important modulator of IGF bioactivity and somatic growth in utero.\r"

  ".W": "Nine studies have attempted to address the issue of whether familial aggregation of epilepsy and clefting disorders exists. This is an important issue as a genetic predisposition to clefting among relatives of individuals with epilepsy could potentiate any teratogenic effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The summary relative risk estimate derived from published studies does not show that epilepsy and clefting disorders aggregate in families. Rather, these studies suggest that the clefting abnormalities in offspring of women with epilepsy receiving AEDs are most likely related to a teratogenic effect of these medications.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatic sinusoidal lesions, including peliosis hepatis and sinusoidal dilatation, are frequently observed during human immunodeficiency virus infection. It has been proposed that human immunodeficiency virus itself plays a role in their pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we attempted to determine whether liver sinusoidal cells express the CD4 molecule, which behaves as a membrane receptor mediating the binding of human immunodeficiency virus to its target cells. For this purpose, three monoclonal antibodies-OKT4, OKT4a and anti-Leu3a + 3b, binding to different epitopes of the CD4 molecule-were used. All antibodies tested had the same tissue reactivity. On light microscopy, they reacted with most sinusoidal macrophages and in addition gave a continuous labeling of the sinusoidal lining suggestive of endothelial cell reactivity. On ultrastructural examination, the plasma membranes of both sinusoidal macrophages and endothelial cells were labeled. The reactive antigen was characterized by immunoblotting of liver homogenates. A unique band was detected, corresponding to an antigen with an apparent molecular weight of 54,000 Da, comparable to that reported for the CD4 molecule expressed on lymphocytes and monocytes. Therefore combination of structural and immunochemical data makes it possible to assess that both endothelial cells and macrophages of the hepatic sinusoid express the CD4 molecule. Consequently, both cell types constitute putative targets for human immunodeficiency virus and/or human immunodeficiency virus-related lesions. They may be involved in the pathogenesis of liver sinusoidal lesions observed in human immunodeficiency virus infection and may constitute an unsuspected reservoir of the virus.\r"

  ".W": "The expression and localization of extracellular matrix proteins in rat liver was investigated as a function of liver development. Levels of extracellular matrix proteins were measured by dot-blot or immunoblot protocols using monospecific antibodies prepared against collagen types I, III and IV; laminin; fibronectin; and fibronectin receptor. Proline and hydroxyproline levels from extracted liver collagen were quantitated by Pico Tag analysis. It was observed that the content of type IV collagen and fibronectin in the rat liver increased two to four times during the perinatal period. In contrast, levels of laminin and collagen types I and III decreased up to twofold in developing rat livers. The content of fibronectin receptor during ontogeny was decreased four times in an inverse relationship to fibronectin molecules. Fibronectin receptor and extracellular matrix proteins displayed no difference in apparent molecular weight as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis immunoblots. Indirect immunofluorescence staining of frozen thin liver sections revealed that the pattern of localization of extracellular matrix proteins in the nonvascular regions of fetal liver was punctate rather than restricted to a specific region such as the perisinusoidal area of adult livers. Similarly, fibronectin receptor was also present, mainly in the sinusoidal area of adult livers, whereas fetal sections were diffusely stained. Our findings suggest that the differential modulation of extracellular matrix proteins and their localization in the developing rat livers undergo a dramatic alteration in the composition and structural organization of matrix material, which may act to modulate proliferation and to promote the differentiation of liver cells during development.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate whether the impairment of mitochondrial function in cirrhosis is due to a reduction in liver cell mass or whether mitochondrial function is altered specifically, we analyzed mitochondrial volume and surface density of mitochondrial membranes in control and cirrhotic rats by stereological means. Cirrhosis was induced by long-term exposure to phenobarbital and CCl4. Hepatocellular and mitochondrial volumes were reduced to a similar extent, by 39% and 40%, respectively, in cirrhotic animals (p less than 0.01). Thus the fraction of hepatocytes occupied by mitochondria did not differ between the two groups. Both total outer (31 +/- 3 vs. 19 +/- 6 m2; p less than 0.01) and inner (87 +/- 24 vs. 45 +/- 12 m2; p less than 0.01) mitochondrial membranes were significantly reduced. Membrane surface was normal per unit of mitochondrial volume, however, suggesting intact mitochondrial structure. Matrix and outer membrane enzyme activities expressed per compartment did not differ between control and cirrhotic animals. Inner membrane, in contrast, had an increased enzyme content per unit area both for cytochrome oxidase (10.3 +/- 2.9 vs. 13.0 +/- 1.6; p less than 0.05) and ATPase (13.7 +/- 1.4 vs. 21.2 +/- 2.9; p less than 0.01). Basal oxygen consumption measured in the perfused liver in situ was significantly reduced in cirrhotic livers (1.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.4 mumol/min-1/gm-1) but was unchanged when expressed per square meter of inner membrane. Our results demonstrate that impaired mitochondrial function is mainly due to loss of hepatocellular mass. Increased enzyme activity per unit surface area of inner mitochondrial membrane may be important to maintain mitochondrial function of the cirrhotic liver.\r"

During the follow-up period, none of the nodules were demonstrated sonographically to have enlarged. Computed tomography and/or hepatic angiography were also performed in 14 patients, but there was no evidence of malignant transformation in these lesions. None of the 17 patients showed acute elevation of serum alpha-fetoprotein levels. Furthermore, four nodules became undetectable by these imaging procedures. Follow-up biopsy performed in seven patients revealed no significant histological changes from the first biopsy sample. However, HCCs developed apart from these large regenerative nodules in four patients. These HCCs suddenly appeared and did not seem to have been derived from preexisting large regenerative nodules. From these observations, it was not possible to regard a large regenerative nodule having no cytological atypia as a high-potential premalignant lesion. Their precancerous potentiality needs to be compared with that of ordinary pseudolobules.\r"

  ".U": "90382793\r", 
  ".W": "The use of the Tsukamoto-French rat model of alcoholic liver disease facilitated pathological, physiological, biochemical and cell biological experiments that examined the validity of some of the existing hypotheses for pathogenesis of alcoholic liver necrosis and fibrosis. Results obtained to date strongly support the contribution of centrilobular hypoxia as a pathogenetic mechanism of alcoholic liver necrosis. The enhanced hepatic lipid peroxidation was not evident at the early stage of ethanol-induced liver necrosis but could be demonstrated at the late stage when the liver damage progressed to liver fibrosis. This suggests that the lipid peroxidation may not be an important mechanism of alcoholic liver necrosis but may be an initiation factor for liver fibrogenesis as recently proposed by others (88). The high-fat diet appears to have promoting effects on both induction of alcoholic liver necrosis and stimulation of liver fibrogenesis. The former may be related to the induction of MEOS by the high-fat diet and consequent centrilobular hypoxia caused by inadequately compensated hepatic overuse of oxygen. The latter can be mediated through sensitization of Ito cells by a high-fat diet. We propose that Kupffer cell-derived TGF beta is, at least in part, responsible for some of phenotypical changes of Ito cells associated with their activation. Our model provides maximal experimental control and induces the discrete stages of alcoholic liver injury that can be reproduced with its pathological evolution telescoped into a short time. Because of these features, replication of the experimental conditions in different laboratories is possible so that results can be validly compared through precise standardization of the experimental protocols. This model requires some training in implantation and maintenance of the gastric catheter. However, the training can be easily attained by anyone who has experience in animal surgery. Another requirement is the initial fund to acquire infusion devices and metabolism cages. Once this equipment is purchased, however, the maintenance cost is low. Even if the initial expenses are included, the cost per animal is relatively inexpensive when compared with the cost involved in the use of larger animals such as baboons or pigs. Since administration of diet and ethanol (or isocaloric glucose solution) is precisely controlled by infusion pumps, this system makes unnecessary the measurement of diet consumption that has to be done daily for each animal with other methods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

After therapy a significant decrease in daily proteinuria was observed, although the reduction exceeded 50% of pre-treatment values in only 16 patients (59%). A progressive decrease in serum creatinine occurred in patients with abnormal renal function; serial measurement of renal plasma flow showed a progressive improvement with an average increase of 6 and 12%, after 1 and 3 months of treatment, respectively.

Minute ventilation (MV) was reduced from 4.01 +/- 0.31 to 0.74 +/- 0.07 l/min (p less than 0.0001), FiO2 of the ventilator from 1.0 to 0.46 +/- 0.08 (p less than 0.0001) whereas FiO2 of the membrane lung (ML) was not changed significantly (FIO2ML 0.59 +/- 0.07 vs 0.53 +/- 0.06). During controlled mechanical ventilation (CMV), comparable adequate gas exchange was only achieved at a significantly higher mean airway pressure (Paw 14.1 +/- 0.08 vs 21.2 +/- 0.47 cmH20, p less than 0.0001). Hemodynamic variables did not change significantly during bypass time. ECCO2-R/LPPV driven by a simple renal perfusion system allows adequate gas exchange in experimental respiratory failure.\r"

Extensive investigations aimed at overcoming these problems have resulted in the preparation of pyridoxalated-hemoglobin-polyoxyethylene conjugate (PHP). PHP was developed from human hemoglobin by two major chemical modifications; pyridoxylation for the purpose of lowering the oxygen affinity (P50 of 19.5 +/- 1.2 mmHg), and coupling with polyoxyethylene (POE) to increase its molecular weight (to approximately 90 kdaltons). The circulating half-life of PHP is about 40 hours in dogs. Toxicological and physiological studies including renal function assessments have demonstrated that PHP does not have untoward effects on major organ functions. Its efficacy in transporting oxygen has been shown in ET and intracoronary perfusion, and in in vitro studies with sickle cells. Studies to date suggest that PHP is a promising candidate as a physiological oxygen carrier. In this paper the properties of PHP, its safety and efficacy aspects, and its potential as a clinical oxygen carrier are reviewed based on studies conducted in the Author's laboratory.\r"

Recently, calcium antagonists have been successfully employed to prevent migraine, and preliminary studies also indicate that verapamil in particular is an efficacious treatment for CCH. We have conducted a multicenter trial employing a double-dummy, double blind, cross-over protocol, comparing verapamil with the established efficacy of lithium carbonate, in preventing CCH attacks. Both lithium carbonate and verapamil were effective in preventing CCH but verapamil caused fewer side effects and had a shorter latency period. We did not observe any correlation between plasma levels of the two drugs and their clinical efficacy. Both the drugs tested here may exert their effect by restoring a normal inhibitory tone to the pain modulating pathways from the trigemino-vascular system, a circuit putatively implicated in CCH.\r"

Of 110 patients enrolled, 54 received Jobst pressure garments and 56 received Tubigrip pressure garments. Time spent in pressure-therapy garments was the same for both groups. Comparable clinical results were achieved with either Tubigrip or Jobst garments. A significantly greater percentage of patients were compliant with Tubigrip pressure-garment therapy than with Jobst pressure-garment therapy. The cost of the Tubigrip garments was significantly lower than that of Jobst garments. These data suggest that the use of elasticized cotton pressure garments results in significantly better patient compliance, a lower cost, and equal therapeutic efficacy when compared with the elasticized nylon pressure garments.\r"

The study sample consisted of 59 health professionals from a pediatric burn hospital who had worked at least one year with children with acute burns and their families in discharge planning. With the use of the Delphi technique, a three-round survey was conducted. A Pediatric Acute Burn Discharge Planning Index that consists of 75 items was developed on the basis of the items that received a mean score of 5.0 or greater in the third survey. The data were further analyzed with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to compare the top 23 rank-ordered items rated by the nursing department with those rated by the other departments surveyed. The rank-order correlation showed a positive correlation between the nursing department's and other departments' responses. These results indicate that all health team members agree on the importance of assessing the items listed on the derived index before discharging a pediatric patient with acute burns.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma prorenin is abnormally high, whereas renin is normal or even low, in many patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus complicated by microvascular disease. Nephropathy or autonomic neuropathy has been put forward as a cause. We found that in 223 consecutive diabetics prorenin correlated positively with serum creatinine, the presence of macroalbuminuria (greater than 250 mg/L), and the presence of diabetic retinopathy, particularly the proliferative type. This correlation did not depend on the presence of neuropathy or whether the patient was receiving insulin. It was also independent of sex, age, duration of diabetes, blood pressure, and blood levels of glucose and hemoglobin-A1c. The association between elevated prorenin and retinopathy remained significant after adjustment for creatinine and the presence of macroalbuminuria. Of the whole group of diabetics 94 consecutive patients were assessed for the presence of microalbuminuria (30-300 mg/24 h). Independently of the presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria, the mean level of prorenin was not above normal in the patients without retinopathy and was 2-3 times normal in those with proliferative retinopathy. Thus, retinopathy appears to be a more important determinant of abnormally high prorenin than nephropathy. In addition, the renal vein to artery ratio of prorenin in 7 diabetics with both advanced nephropathy and proliferative retinopathy was not elevated, despite the high peripheral venous prorenin level and the impaired renal perfusion. Thus, the abnormally high prorenin level in these patients could not be explained by abnormal secretion by the kidneys. Finally, prorenin was not high in 16 nondiabetics with loss of sympathetic activity due to chronic autonomic neuropathy, which indicates that in the absence of diabetes, this type of autonomic failure is not sufficient to cause the high prorenin levels seen in diabetics. Our findings are evidence that abnormally high plasma prorenin levels in diabetics are not an immediate consequence of altered glucose metabolism. This abnormality is related to the development of microvascular disease in the eye and kidney and is at least in part due to decreased clearance of prorenin from the circulation, increased production from extrarenal sources, or both.\r"

In the present study the relationships among the regional distribution of body fat, selected metabolic variables, and abdominal adipose cell lipolysis were investigated in 30 premenopausal women, 34 +/- 8 yr (mean +/- SD) of age, with body mass indices ranging from 17-45 kg/m2. Basal as well as epinephrine- and isoproterenol-stimulated lipolyses were positively correlated with fasting plasma insulin and triglyceride levels (0.48 less than r less than 0.64; 0.05 greater than P less than 0.0005 and 0.46 less than r less than 0.60; 0.05 greater than P less than 0.005, respectively) and with the insulin area measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (0.49 less than r less than 0.67; 0.005 greater than P less than 0.0005). With the exception of epinephrine-stimulated lipolysis, these correlations remained significant when lipolysis was corrected for cell surface area. Basal and maximal epinephrine- and isoproterenol-induced lipolyses were also negatively related to plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (-0.52 less than r less than -0.36; 0.05 greater than P less than 0.005). However, these relationships were no longer significant after control for fat cell surface. The associations between abdominal lipolysis and fat distribution did not remain significant when data were adjusted for total adiposity. Taken together, these results support the notion that variations in abdominal adipocyte lipolysis 1) depend more on total body fatness than on fat distribution, and 2) may be involved in the metabolic complications associated with abdominal obesity, particularly those pertaining to plasma insulin and triglyceride metabolism.\r"

Only one major form (mol wt, 48,000 daltons) of cytochrome P450IIE1 was detected with a specific polyclonal antibody against P450IIE1. Levels of cytochrome P450IIE1 were very low to undetectable in human lymphocytes from seven normal subjects. However, levels of P450IIE1 were elevated in lymphocytes from patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Elevated levels of cytochrome P450IIE1 determined by immunoblot analysis correlate positively with the levels of hemoglobin A1 (r = 0.8), a metabolic indicator in diabetic subjects. In one study subject in whom diabetic control was improved, the drop in hemoglobin A1C levels was accompanied by normalization of P450IIE1 levels.\r"

  ".W": "Western ligand blot analysis of the different molecular forms of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein IGF-BP) in serum and plasma samples from 89 pregnant women has revealed a marked decrease, after the second month of pregnancy, in the 41.5 and 38.5K species (which are the binding units of the 150K complex) as well as in the 24K form. There was also a slight decrease in the 34K form, the 30K form was unaffected, and additional 21.5 and 20K bands appeared. Cross-linking experiments demonstrated the disapperance of a 49K band which is characteristic of the 150K complex. The alterations of the electrophoretic profile of the BPs were accompanied by a decrease in binding activity of up to 90%. Gel filtration at pH 7.4 confirmed that the decrease was essentially attributable to changes in the 150K complex BPs: 1) material eluting in the 150K zone contained only one third of the binding activity, as opposed to three quarters in reference material; 2) radiocompetition experiments illustrated the loss of affinity for IGF-I and IGF-II of the BPs extracted from the 150K complex; 3) ligand blot analysis revealed, in contrast with the virtual disappearance of the 41.5 and 38.5K forms, the appearance of a broad indistinct band at 30K and additional bands at 21.5 and 20K. With immunoblotting, the anti-IGF-BP-3 antibody, which specifically recognizes the 41.5 and 38.5K species, cross-reacted with this 30K material. The alterations of the BPs appeared to be enzymatic. When pregnancy serum was mixed with reference serum, the 41.5, 38.5, and 24K forms contributed by the reference serum were markedly reduced after 30 min of incubation at 37 C. However, these alterations could be prevented by incubation at either 0 or at 37 C in the presence of EDTA or aprotinin and could be curbed in the presence of high concentrations of phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. Unmixed reference serum incubated at 37 C yielded an unchanged BP profile. Incubation of pregnancy serum with hypopituitary serum, which has elevated levels of the 34 and 30K BPs, resulted in a marked decrease in the 41.5 and 38.5K forms, a slight alteration of the 34K form, and no change in the 30K form. These findings suggest that during pregnancy, enzymatic (probably protease) activity either appears or is significantly increased in the circulation, which specifically degrades some of the IGF-BPs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We have examined, by Western ligand blotting, the profiles of these binding proteins in human female serum in the normal menstrual cycle, throughout pregnancy, and during the postpartum period. There was no change in the serum profile of any of the binding proteins in early pregnancy compared to that in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle. However, there was a marked decrease in circulating levels of the main serum IGFBP, IGFBP-3, after 6 weeks of gestation, continuing progressively to term and returning to nonpregnant levels by 5 days postpartum. IGFBP-2 decreased steadily throughout gestation. In contrast, IGFBP-1 levels were found to rise by the second trimester. Endoglycosidase-F digestion did not enhance detection of IGFBP-3 by ligand blotting. Immunoprecipitations with two separate antibodies against IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2, followed by Western ligand blotting, confirmed the marked decrease in IGFBP-3 levels after 6 weeks of gestation and the more gradual decrease in IGFBP-2. In contrast, immunoprecipitations with IGFBP-1 monoclonal antibodies confirmed the increase in IGFBP-1 during gestation. Endogenous serum IGFs were separated from serum IGFBPs by acid chromatography, and an 80% decrease in total IGF-binding activity in the IGFBP fraction of chromatographed pregnancy vs. nonpregnancy serum was detected by charcoal absorption assay. Furthermore, immunoprecipitations of IGF affinity cross-linked IGFBP fractions with IGFBP-3-specific antiserum confirmed a marked diminution of IGFBP-3 in pregnancy compared to nonpregnancy serum, and revealed, only in pregnancy serum, the concomitant appearance of a band with a mol wt of 34K and three less intense bands with mol wt between 20-26K on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Incubation of nonpregnancy serum with 6-week pregnancy serum at 37 C for 5 h, followed by Western ligand blotting, showed only a slight reduction in the amount of IGFBP-3 in the mixture compared to that in controls. However, incubation of term pregnancy with nonpregnancy serum at 37 C for 5 h revealed a marked reduction of IGFBP-3 in the mixture. When iodinated recombinant IGFBP-3 was incubated with term pregnancy serum under the same conditions, the appearance of a 29K protein was identified by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography, along with three less intense bands with mol wt between 17-22K.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In the group treated with hormones bone mineral density in the spine (dual photon absorptiometry) and bone mineral content in the ultradistal forearm (single photon absorptiometry) increased highly significantly by 8-10% during the 1 yr of treatment. Bone mineral content in the mid-shaft of the forearm (single photon absorptiometry) and the total body bone mineral (dual photon absorptiometry) increased by 3-5% when compared to that in the placebo group, which showed virtually unchanged values at all measurement sites. Seven of the women treated with hormones were examined after a further year of treatment. BMC increased by another 3-6%, reaching a 12% increase in bone mineral density in the spine after 2 yr of treatment. Biochemical estimates of bone resorption (fasting urinary calcium and hydroxyproline) and bone formation (serum alkaline phosphatase and plasma osteocalcin), decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) in the group treated with hormones, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. The reduction in indices of bone resorption was more pronounced than that in bone formation after one year, indicating a positive bone balance. No further changes were seen in these bone turnover parameters during the second year of treatment. In the group treated with hormones, serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by about 12% (P less than 0.05-P less than 0.01), whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by about 8% (P less than 0.001). The high density lipoprotein cholesterol/low density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio was unchanged. The hormone treatment did not produce any major side effects, and only minor bleedings were experienced by a few women. The present study demonstrates that treatment with female sex hormones in this particular combination is a realistic approach to the treatment of women with established postmenopausal osteoporosis.\r"

  ".W": "GnRH analogs, both agonists and antagonists, have potential use in androgen-dependent diseases of older men, such as prostatic cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Previous experience with agonists of GnRH has suggested that GnRH analogs may be more effective in aged men than in young men, but little is known about GnRH antagonists in older men. Therefore, we evaluated the hormonal effects of a single dose and a short course of a GnRH antagonist (Nal-Glu) in normal elderly men. Six young men (25-34 yr old) and six older men (66-76 yr) each received single morning injections of Nal-Glu (25, 75, and 250 micrograms/kg), separated by 2 weeks. Serum levels of testosterone (T), immunoreactive LH (LH RIA) and FSH (FSH RIA), and bioactive LH (LH BIO) were evaluated periodically for 7 days after each injection. In addition, six elderly men received 25 and 75 micrograms/kg.day Nal-Glu for 10 consecutive mornings each, and serum levels of T, inhibin, LH RIA, LH BIO, FSH RIA, and bioactive FSH were evaluated. Nal-Glu in all three single doses caused a significant (P less than 0.01) decline in serum levels of T and gonadotropins that was similar in extent in the elderly and young men. For example, T declined to a level of 19% of baseline after the 250 micrograms/kg dose of Nal-Glu in both age groups. For both the young and elderly men, the major effect of increasing the Nal-Glu dose was a prolongation of the period of suppression. Multiple Nal-Glu injections in the elderly men also resulted in a rapid decline in T, inhibin, and bioactive and immunoreactive gonadotropins. For both LH and FSH, bioactivity decreased to a greater extent than immunoreactivity. Local side-effects of Nal-Glu tended to be fewer and of less intensity in the elderly men compared to those in the young men. These results demonstrate that the response to Nal-Glu in healthy elderly men is similar to that in younger men, and extended administration of Nal-Glu in elderly men effectively suppresses gonadal and pituitary function. These results suggest that the role of GnRH antagonists in the effective treatment of androgen-dependent disease in the aging male needs to be explored further.\r"

We have examined the effect of EGF upon first trimester (7-10 gestational weeks) placental hCG secretion and cellular differentiation using both static (explants and isolated cells) and kinetic (superfusion of explants) culture methods. In superfused explants, short (1-4 min) pulses of EGF increased both the rate and amplitude of spontaneous pulsatility of hCG. The frequency increased from 3/h to 5/h, and the amplitude increased compared to the control channels as calculated by the area under the curve. This effect was dose dependent and the concentration of 50 ng/ml, which was the lowest dose tested, was the most effective. In explants cultured for 24 h, EGF caused a 2-fold increase in hCG secretion, compared to control, P less than 0.05. In two different dispersed trophoblastic cell cultures, EGF added daily for the first week caused a 180% increase in hCG secretion, P less than 0.05. However, according to morphological criteria, i.e. light microscopy and vital staining, no significant effect upon the rate of differentiation to syncytiotrophoblast was observed in long-term cultures of one of these preparations. In conclusion, EGF plays a dual trophic role in stimulating hCG secretion in the first trimester. However, this effect is not dependent on cellular differentiation.\r"

In order to use the IC-GH as a diagnostic tool a normative reference range needs to be established. We determined the IC-GH by continuous blood withdrawal in 119 children of normal height, weight and growth rate. Although the mean IC-GH increased with pubertal status, 4.4 +/- 1.2 micrograms/L at Tanner I (n = 36), 5.5 +/- 2.1 micrograms/L at Tanner II-III (n = 43), and 5.8 +/- 1.6 at Tanner IV-V (n = 40) (P less than 0.03), there was a considerable overlap of individual IC-GH levels between the pubertal groups. Gender affected the mean IC-GH level slightly, but not the range. Although the mean IC-GH of girls tended to be higher than that of boys this difference was not statistically significant. Ninety five percent of the IC-GH values were above the 3.2 micrograms/L level. The response to pharmacological stimulation (clonidine, insulin, or arginine) was also evaluated in 68 of the subjects. The peak GH response to pharmacological stimulation (micrograms/L) with clonidine 21.0 +/- 10.7 (n = 66) was significantly higher than to either arginine 13.1 +/- 6.1 (n = 23) or insulin 14.2 +/- 6.3 (n = 19) (P less than 0.01). The peak response to clonidine increased significantly with pubertal status (P less than 0.001) and there was an interactive effect of gender and pubertal stage where the GH response of prepubertal boys exceeded that of prepubertal girls but the response of pubertal girls exceeded that of pubertal boys (P less than 0.02). The peak stimulated GH levels was correlated with IC-GH in this subgroup r = 0.52, P less than 0.0001).

  ".W": "The group of children who have clinical manifestations of GH deficiency may potentially contain a large number of patients with secretory defects of cortisol. We assessed physiological cortisol secretion by measuring the 24-h integrated concentration of cortisol (IC-F) in a series of 105 patients, aged 7-19 yr, undergoing endocrinological evaluation for growth impairment possibly due to GH deficiency. The reference value for IC-F, established from 30 normal stature, normal weight children (controls), aged 7-18 yr, was 157 +/- 41 nmol/L (mean +/- 1 SD). There was no effect of age, gender, or pubertal status on IC-F in controls. The IC-F of patients was 150 +/- 72 nmol/L. Twelve patients (11%) had IC-F values more than 2 SD below the mean (i.e. less than 75 nmol/L) of the controls (P less than 0.001). An IC-F below 75 nmol/L was associated with a blunted peak cortisol response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia (367 +/- 160 nmol/L compared to 464 +/- 155 nmol/L in the other patients; (P less than 0.05). None of the patients had obvious clinical symptoms of hypocortisolemia at the time of testing. In general, IC-F levels were not correlated with IC-GH. However, 10 patients who had subnormal IC-F values also had laboratory evidence of GH secretory defects; 7 had subnormal IC-GH levels but normal stimulated GH responses, and 3 had both subnormal responses to stimulation as well as subnormal IC-GH. The long term prognosis and management implications of hypocortisolemia diagnosed in this patient group require further evaluation.\r"

  ".W": "The relation of the reproductive endocrine system to impotence in older men was examined by measuring the concentrations of testosterone (T), bioavailable testosterone (BT), LH, and PRL and body mass index (BMI) in 57 young controls (YC), 50 healthy potent older controls attending a health fair (HF), and 267 impotent patients (SD). The SD and HF had markedly reduced mean T and BT values compared to YC. When adjusted for age and BMI there was no difference in BT between potent and impotent older men. The percent BT was much higher in YC than in the older groups. While the percent BT rose significantly with increased T in YC, it was inversely related to T in the older subjects, suggesting that increased sex hormone-binding globulin binding was a primary event leading to a low BT. Forty-eight percent of HF and 39% of SD were hypogonadal, as defined by a mean BT of 2.5 SD or more below the mean of YC (less than or equal to 2.3 nmol/L). Ninety percent of these had LH values in the normal range, suggesting hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Thirty-four SD and six each of YC and older control volunteers (OC) underwent GnRH testing. Older subjects showed impaired responsiveness to GnRH compared to YC. A low basal LH level correlated very highly with hyporesponsiveness to GnRH. Thus, secondary hypogonadism and impotence are two common, independently distributed conditions of older men.\r"

  ".U": "90383317\r", 
  ".W": "To determine the specific alteration in B-cell function caused by a somatostatin analog in man and to determine the effect of the induced insulin deficiency on insulin action, we administered octreotide (SMS 201-995; 50 micrograms twice daily) to nine healthy male subjects, aged 24-35 yr. B-Cell function was assessed by measuring the acute insulin response (AIR) to glucose (AIRglucose) at fasting glucose and to arginine (AIRarg) at glucose concentrations of fasting, approximately 14 and more than 28 mM after 2 (n = 7) and 8 days (n = 9) of octreotide. The AIRarg at more than 28 mM glucose (AIR500) is an estimate of B-cell secretory capacity, while the glucose level at which 50% of AIR500 occurs is termed PG50 and can provide an estimate of B-cell glucose sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity and the parameters describing glucose disposal were measured using Bergman's minimal model. Octreotide administration resulted in the development of mild fasting hyperglycemia, marked fasting hypoinsulinemia, as well as a marked reduction in AIRglucose [mean +/- SE; pretreatment, 260 +/- 48 pM; 1 day, 62 +/- 14 pM (P less than 0.005 vs. pretreatment); 8 days, 62 +/- 7 pM (P less than 0.005 vs. pretreatment)]. In addition, there was an associated marked reduction in iv glucose tolerance. While the AIRarg at fasting glucose (pretreatment, 233 +/- 27 pM; 2 days, 144 +/- 27 pM; 8 days 281 +/- 55 pM) and AIR500 (pretreatment 1000 +/- 178 pM; 2 days, 651 +/- 82 pM; 8 days, 1041 +/- 219 pM) remained unchanged, the AIRarg at 14 mM decreased significantly during octreotide [pretreatment 986 +/- 178 pM; 2 days, 363 +/- 62 pM (P less than 0.001 vs. pretreatment); 8 days, 623 +/- 130 pM (P less than 0.005 vs. pretreatment)], resulting in a rightward shift of the dose-response curve such that the estimated PG50 increased from 8.8 +/- 0.6 to 12.9 +/- 1.3 mM (P less than 0.05) after 2 days and was maintained for 8 days (11.2 +/- 0.8 mM; P less than 0.05 vs. pretreatment). Despite the development of marked insulin deficiency, the insulin sensitivity index (SI) did not change significantly (pretreatment, 11.34 +/- 1.59 x 10(-5); 1 day, 10.01 +/- 2.28 x 10(-5); 7 days, 9.65 +/- 1.69 x 10(-5) min-1/pM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. In a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. The organisms cultured were: Candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), Gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), Streptococcus milleri (n = 1), Streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). Where a bacterial organism was isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. It is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.\r"

The recent cloning and sequencing of the gene permitted deduction of its amino acid sequence which is identical with the human membrane-associated enzyme, neutral endopeptidase. Strong immunostaining for CALLA was detected in the human liver with a canalicular pattern. Immunoelectron microscopy also confirmed that the antigen was localised only in the area of the bile canaliculi. Although the function of neutral endopeptidase in the canaliculi is unknown, this antigen may prove useful in the study of biliary function and diseases.\r"

The IAP technique was straightforward to perform, it yielded quick results, and was highly reproducible, provided that a standardised short fixation period of two and a half hours was used. For the detection of immunoglobulin deposits, the IAP results correlated well with those of immunofluorescence. Despite poorer performance in identifying complement components and fibrinogen it could, within certain limits, provide an adequate diagnostic alternative to immunofluorescence. Each technique gave false negative results, those of immunofluorescence being related to its failure to identify mesangial deposition of IgA in two cases where its distribution seemed to be focal, and those of IAP to a failure to detect linear deposition of IgG in all three cases of anti-glomerular basement membrane disease.\r"

The best results were obtained with the avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase complex method with no prior trypsinisation or DNAse digestion, and with imidazole added to the final diaminobenzidine developing solution. A simple semiquantitative scoring system was used to assess the staining results which were then compared with the results obtained by a standard dextran-coated charcoal biochemical assay. Of 31 cases examined, the results of the two methods were concordant in 25 (81%) of cases. This is near the higher end of the concordance range obtained by several other authors using frozen sections. The discordance encountered in a few cases was possibly the result of sampling errors which are more likely to occur with the chemical rather than the histological method. It is concluded that the method described here is fairly reliable and would greatly simplify the process of assessment of progesterone receptors in breast, and possibly other tumours.\r"

Peak geometric mean concentrations of antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen at day 200 were 1094, 387, and 43 mIU/ml, respectively. By day 360, these concentrations had fallen to 346, 124, and 19 mIU/ml, respectively (P less than .05 between groups both dates). Number of subjects with antibody greater than or equal to 10 mIU/ml at day 200 was similar between the 10-micrograms recombinant and 2-micrograms plasma-derived groups (94% vs. 90%), while only 78% of the 1-microgram recombinant group had protective concentrations of antibodies (P less than .05). Erythema and induration occurred in most subjects in both intradermal groups, while pain was prominent at the intramuscular site especially after the second dose. Thus, plasma-derived vaccine, 2 micrograms in 0.1 ml intradermally, appears to be an acceptable cost-saving method for hepatitis B immunization, while recombinant-derived vaccine, 1 microgram in 0.1 ml intradermally, produced less satisfactory results.\r"

U1102 replicated in the continuous T cell lines, J JHAN and HSB-2, whereas no Z29 replication was observed in these cell lines as judged by infectious virus yields, the presence of viral antigens, and viral DNA replication. The two strains were compared with respect to their ability to react in immunofluorescence assays with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) prepared against the GS strain of HHV-6. These MAbs are directed against six different polypeptides including three glycoproteins. All MAbs reacted with cells infected with the U1102 strain. The Z29-infected cells reacted with four MAbs but failed to react with MAbs specific for an 82- to 105-kDa major surface glycoprotein and with one MAb reactive with a nonglycosylated 180-kDa protein. Taken together, the two strains of HHV-6 exhibit variations with regard to their growth and antigenic properties.\r"

A protein(s) near a molecular mass of 60 kDa in extracts of five group A streptococcal serotypes and the M-negative strain reacted with the MAbs. A study of human antibody responses to purified membranes of S. pyogenes indicated a hyperreactivity to a 60-kDa protein in acute rheumatic fever. Since MAbs 36.2.2 and 54.2.8 are known to cross-react with myosin or actin and streptococcal M protein, the data suggest that a homology or conformation is shared between the 60-kDa antigen and M protein. Therefore, the 60-kDa antigen is a new heart- or tissue-cross-reactive antigen of S. pyogenes that shares immunologic epitopes with but is distinct from M protein.\r"

When grown on colonization factor antigen (CFA) agar for 3 h at 37 degrees C, ETEC with CFA/I or CFA/II pili had typical peritrichous flagella and adhered strongly to human ileal lymphoid follicle and villus epithelium. In contrast, E. coli cells with CFA/I or CFA/II pili and possessing very weak or no motility displayed low levels of adherence to the epithelium. UPEC, which possessed type 1 pili and rarely had flagella, strongly adhered to human urinary bladder mucosa but not to human ileal epithelium. Type 1 pili-possessing E. coli isolated from human feces behaved as did UPEC. Moreover, M cells (microfolds) present in human ileal lymphoid follicle epithelium provided adherence sites for type 1 pili but not for CFA/I or CFA/II pili. These data demonstrate the importance of bacterial motility in efficient in vitro adherence to human ileal epithelia, in contrast to human urinary epithelia, and the adhesin specificity of bacterial adherence to M cell microfolds.\r"

There have been suggestions that chlamydial antigens of approximately 57,000-60,000 Mr may be involved in the immunopathology. Two important chlamydial antigens of 57,000-60,000 Mr are a Triton X-100-soluble antigen, which induces hypersensitivity in ocular models, and a sarcosyl-insoluble cysteine-rich structural protein, omp2. In this study, a 57,000 Mr Triton X-100-soluble protein was characterized as the chlamydial homolog of groEL, a heat shock protein. Using protein fractions, antibody responses of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and ectopic pregnancy patients to chlamydial groEL and omp2 were differentiated. Nearly all patients in both groups were reactive to omp2. Of those with titers greater than or equal to 1:512, 31% of PID sera and 81% of ectopic pregnancy sera were positive for chlamydial groEL (P = .004). This selectivity suggests that women with PID who develop chronic sequelae are those with antibody to groEL.\r"

This antigen is highly immunogenic in naturally infected humans and was recognized by sera from 22 patients with invasive disease but not by sera from 13 patients harboring nonpathogenic strains. Its surface location is supported by its differential extraction in the detergent phase of Triton X-114 and by surface immunofluorescence of live trophozoites. Unlike previously described amebic surface antigens, this 30-kDa antigen is undetectable in axenic strains that were originally isolated from patients with invasive disease but have been adapted to grow without bacteria. Affinity-purified antibody to the 30-kDa antigen did not promote lysis of complement-resistant pathogenic strains. This surface antigen may be diagnostically important in the identification of pathogenic clinical isolates.\r"

From the first group, the same 66 immunoblot-confirmed enzyme immunoassay (EIA)-positive specimens were identified in sera from venipuncture and parallel fingerstick PA specimens. The latter had slightly higher EIA mean background levels resulting in 10 immunoblot-negative EIA-positive samples versus 6 in the sera group. HIV-1 seroprevalence was 17% of 393 from the drop-in clinic. By category of IVDU, the rates were 34% and 14% for active and recovering IVDU, respectively (P less than .001), and 36% in black and Latino compared with 13% in white IVDU (P less than .002). Of the 145 participants in the methadone program, 39% had antibody to HIV-1: 49% for blacks and Latinos compared with 30% in whites (P less than .01). The data indicate that antibody testing for HIV-1 by PA is equivalent to the serum antibody assay of venipuncture specimens. The fingerstick method appears to have greater use for serosurveys and screening programs because of convenience, safety, and ease of storage, transport, and processing of samples.\r"

Topical vaginal application of subinhibitory concentration of gentamicin reduced bacteremia to 23% of neonates. Topical methyl-alpha-D-mannoside and p-nitrophenyl-D-mannoside, however, prevented bacteremia in 100% of newborn mice. A neonatal meningitis strain of E. coli K1 (C94) caused bacteremia in 100% of neonates and was also completely inhibited by methyl-alpha-D-mannoside.

Fifteen isolates from the neutropenic patients were resistant to extended spectrum cephalosporins; only 12 of 35 isolates from the nonneutropenic patients were resistant to Enterobacter species. The neutropenic patients also had more beta-lactam therapy, both immediately before bacteremia and in the preceding year, than did nonneutropenic patients.

Each study was repeated on a control day without pressure breathing. Results were as follows (mean +/- SE, p less than 0.05): (1) continuous positive pressure breathing decreased urinary sodium from 0.28 +/- 0.07 to 0.17 +/- 0.04 mEq/min, increased atrial natriuretic peptide from 34.2 +/- 4.9 to 48.5 +/- 6.9 pg/ml, and had no effect on osmolar and free water clearances, cardiac output, plasma renin activity, or plasma aldosterone and plasma arginine vasopressin levels; and (2) continuous negative pressure breathing increased free water clearance from 0.6 +/- 0.7 to 4.5 +/- 1.2 ml/min, urine volume from 4.0 +/- 0.8 to 8.9 +/- 1.3 ml/min, and cardiac output from 5.1 +/- 0.4 to 7.0 +/- 0.6 L/min in a proportional manner (r = 0.40, p less than 0.01) and had no effect on osmolar clearance, urinary volumes of sodium and potassium, plasma renin activity, plasma aldosterone, atrial natriuretic peptide, and arginine vasopressin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "90383589\r", 
  ".W": "The possibility that postprandial hyperinsulinemia could play a role in the development of hepatic lipid disturbances during convalescence from influenza B infection was explored in the ferret as a possible model of the steatosis of Reye's syndrome. Postprandial hyperinsulinemia was produced by feeding young ferrets glucose/water and a regular diet (glucose-treated group), as reflected by the mean serum insulin levels attained, which were 57 and 135 microU/ml during control and postinfluenza periods, respectively. By comparison, ferrets fed water and a regular diet (untreated group) had mean insulin levels of 19 and 22 microU/ml, while postprandial glucose levels were comparable in the two groups of animals for each period. In contrast to untreated animals, grossly visible fatty livers were found in glucose-treated ferrets during convalescence. The total lipid content of these livers had doubled compared with preinfection samples and compared with livers of untreated ferrets. By electron microscopy hepatic mitochondria showed striking changes with diminution of matrix density and reduction in cristae surface area only in convalescent samples from glucose-treated animals. Serum free fatty acid (FFA) levels were considerably higher in the glucose-treated animals during fasting before influenza and also after feeding during convalescence. Serum triglyceride (TG) levels were also high during convalescence in the glucose-treated group. Adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activities were similar between groups, but hormone-sensitive lipase activity was twelvefold higher in glucose-treated ferrets before and after influenza B. These findings indicate that for a given stimulus, glucose-treated ferrets would mobilize more FFA than untreated ferrets. The total capacity for beta-oxidation of FA by the mitochondrial pathway was identical in all groups of animals. Total carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT) activity was the same in both control groups, but was significantly diminished in glucose-treated animals during convalescence. As CPT regulates the entry of FA into the mitochondrial matrix, its reduction in response to higher insulin concentrations would limit the oxidation of FA and stimulate TG accumulation. Therefore, the accumulation of lipid in the liver in this model is regarded to have been caused by the simultaneous occurrence of increased lipolysis and increased hepatic TG synthesis owing, in part, to diversion of activated FA by CPT, which is reduced in activity due to the regulatory action of insulin. These findings may have pathophysiologic relevance for the lipid changes that occur in Reye's syndrome and to fatty liver formation in hyperinsulinemic states.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin is an established regulator of intracellular proteolysis in several mammalian tissues but little is known about its role in the kidney. The present study was undertaken to determine whether insulin influences protein degradation in isolated rat renal proximal tubules and to investigate its mechanism of action in cultured proximal-like tubular epithelial cells from the opossum kidney. Long-lived protein degradation was determined from the release of carbon 14-labeled valine from previously labeled cellular protein under conditions designed to minimize label reutilization. In isolated tubules, the mean control rate of proteolysis was 2.18% per hour, indicating an appreciable turnover of cellular protein. Insulin (10(-6) mol/L) decreased the rate by 23%. In cultured kidney cells, the rate of protein degradation averaged 1.25% per hour in the presence of serum and 1.68% per hour in its absence, an increase of 34%. High insulin concentrations suppressed this acceleration completely, and physiologic levels inhibited it partially. No evidence was obtained to indicate that insulin action is mediated through stimulation of Na(+)-H+ antiport or through increased amino acid utilization. Ammonium chloride, however, strongly attenuated the serum deprivation response and the inhibitory effect of insulin. The exact mechanisms whereby insulin inhibits proteolysis is not known, but these findings are consistent with an inhibitory action of insulin on the lysosomal pathway.\r"

  ".U": "90383653\r", 
  ".W": "A prescription inventory was performed over a period of 3 months in all pharmacies in Sweden's northernmost province. Norrbotten, in order to assess the prevalence of diabetes treated with insulin and oral anti-diabetic agents. A total of 4869 prescriptions were collected from 3482 individuals, of whom 1746 (50.1%) were men. The prevalence of drug-treated diabetes was thus 13.27/1000 inhabitants (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.8-13.7) in the province. Nearly half (47.9%) of all drug-treated diabetics were treated with insulin and the majority (74%) were over 55 years of age, with only 449 (13%) being less than 40 years old. The prevalence of diabetes was highest in individuals aged 75-84 years; in this age group it was 55.47/1000 (95% CI 50.9-58.7). There was considerable regional variation in the prevalence of diabetes in Norrbotten, with a mean prevalence of 23.84/1000 (95% CI 22.1-25.6) in the municipalities in the Tornea Valley, compared to 13.08/1000 (95% CI 1.19-1.28) for the remainder of Norrbotten. While there was no difference in the prevalence of drug-treated diabetes between men and women in the province as a whole, a slightly higher prevalence was found in women (27.41 vs. 24.73/1000) in the Tornea Valley. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in individuals over 40 years of age was 36.62/1000 (95% CI 3.73-4.36) in The Tornea Valley, 24.38/1000 (95% CI 22.8-24.7) in the remainder of Norrbotten, and 27.88/1000 (95% CI 2.50-2.68) in the province as a whole. The estimated prevalence of diabetes mellitus in Norrbotten, including patients treated by diet alone, was of the order of 20.21/1000, with a prevalence of 40.00/1000 in subjects over the age of 40 years. Thus the prevalence of diabetes appears to be higher in the Tornea Valley than in the rest of Norrbotten, while it is apparently lower than has been reported in North Finland.\r"

In vivo and in vitro evidence indicates that these effectors activate phospholipolytic enzymes in cellular membranes. The products of these enzymatic reactions (such as inositol phosphates or arachidonic acid metabolites) can serve as second messengers that can potentially influence glucose, lipid and protein metabolism at the cellular level. Alterations in this second messenger system could be involved in metabolic changes associated with some pathologic conditions as well as certain drug treatments, and thus, a better understanding of the system could reveal new possibilities for therapeutic interventions.\r"

  ".U": "90383953\r", 
  ".W": "The amino acid glutamine has important and unique metabolic functions. It is the most abundant free amino acid in the circulation and in intracellular pools and a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, nucleotides, and many other biologically important molecules. It is the most important precursor for ammoniagenesis in the kidney, the major end product of ammonia-trapping pathways in the liver, a substrate for gluconeogenesis, and an oxidative fuel in rapidly proliferating cells and tissues. Glutamine also may have a number of important regulatory roles, increasing protein synthesis and decreasing protein degradation in skeletal muscle and stimulating glycogen synthesis in the liver. The demonstration that glutamine concentrations decrease and tissue glutamine metabolism increases markedly in many catabolic, stressful disease states has led to a reconsideration of the classification of glutamine as a nonessential amino acid and to the alternative hypothesis that glutamine may be a conditionally essential nutrient. This hypothesis has been supported by recent studies that have shown trophic effects of glutamine-supplemented diets on the growth of specific tissues and on total body nitrogen balance. These observations form the basis for current efforts to define the clinical usefulness of glutamine-supplemented nutrition.\r"

Overwhelming stresses, such as severe systemic infection, may lead to permanent organ dysfunction and further adaptive changes in glutamine metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "A fundamental conceptional change in the field of hepatic glutamine metabolism is derived from an understanding of the unique regulatory properties of hepatic glutaminase, the occurrence of glutamine cycling, and the discovery of marked hepatocyte heterogeneities in nitrogen metabolism, with metabolic interactions between differently localized subacinar hepatocyte populations. This change provided new insight into the role of the liver in maintaining ammonia and bicarbonate homeostasis under physiologic and pathologic conditions. Glutamine synthetase is present only in a specialized cell population at the hepatic venous outflow of the liver acinus; these cells act as scavengers for ammonia and probably also for various signal molecules (\"perivenous scavenger cell hypothesis\"). The function of mitochondrial glutaminase is that of a pH- and hormone-modulated ammonia amplification system that controls carbamoylphosphate synthesis and urea cycle flux in periportal hepatocytes. Not only is hepatic glutamine metabolism essential for maintenance of bicarbonate and ammonia homeostasis, but glutamine itself can act in the liver as a signal modulating hepatic metabolism. This article summarizes some major aspects of hepatic glutamine metabolism, based on previous reviews.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids on renal active and prokallikrein levels (ng/mg protein) and in vivo kallikrein synthesis rate were studied in the conscious rat. Within two hours after low dose methylprednisolone (MP, 0.0125 to 0.05 mg/100 g body wt), active kallikrein and prokallikrein fell (29.1 +/- 2.3 and 35.1 +/- 2.7 ng/mg protein, respectively, compared to 38.4 +/- 3.7 and 42.7 +/- 3.4 in vehicle-treated rats, P less than 0.05 or less). These changes were accompanied by a significant fall in prokallikrein synthesis rate relative to total protein synthesis. The reductions in active and prokallikrein levels were transient, dissipating by six hours. With increasing MP doses, there was further dose-dependent reduction in active kallikrein. However, prokallikrein levels increased to normal as the MP dose was increased despite continued suppression of synthesis, suggesting that prokallikrein activation was inhibited. Renal kallikrein levels were also examined in relation to changes in endogenous glucocorticoid levels. In intact rats, three hours after plasma corticosterone peaked (10 p.m.), active and prokallikrein levels were 30.2 +/- 2.9 and 27.0 +/- 1.6 ng/mg protein, respectively, compared to 36.9 +/- 2.3 and 37.2 +/- 2.6 (P less than 0.005) three hours after the corticosterone nadir (11 a.m.). Furthermore, adrenalectomy increased active and prokallikrein (47.3 +/- 4.8 and 87.3 +/- 6.0 ng/mg protein, respectively), compared to levels in intact or shamoperated rats (intact: 32.9 +/- 2.9 and 54.9 +/- 5.3 ng/mg protein, P less than 0.01 or less). Adrenalectomy also eliminated the diurnal changes in kallikrein levels seen in intact rats. These data suggest that renal prokallikrein synthesis and activation are physiologically regulated by glucocorticoids.\r"

These studies were performed in 50 patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 17 patients with Henoch Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN), 11 control patients with IgA negative, diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (DMPGN) and 50 healthy controls. Total PIgA (PIgAT) and PIgA subclass concentrations were measured using a secretory component binding enzyme immunoassay and isotype specific immune complex concentrations were measured using conglutinin (K) binding immunoassays. In cross sectional studies patients with IgAN were found to have increased concentrations of PIgAT, PIgA1, K-IgA1 and K-IgA2 compared to controls. In the longitudinal studies controls and patients had significant increases in PIgAT and PIgA1 concentrations during infection. However, in patients with IgAN, the increases were greater, persisted for longer, and PIgA2 concentrations were also increased. K-IgA1 and K-IgA2 concentrations increased significantly during episodes of infection in IgAN patients in contrast to controls. Patients with HSPN had results similar to those of IgAN patients. No significant correlation was found between PIgA or K-IgA concentrations, and either serum creatinine concentrations or the degree of hematuria. The results indicate that patients with IgA-related renal disease have abnormal regulation of PIgA and immune complexed IgA, and that these abnormalities are exaggerated during mucosal infection.\r"

On the basis of neurochemical studies in laboratory animals, hypotheses explaining their therapeutic effects have been formulated. The most attractive of these theories involves antidepressant-induced changes in the sensitivity of certain catecholamine and serotonergic receptors in the brain. Support for this hypothesis from clinical studies has been difficult to obtain. Pharmacologic studies of antidepressant drugs, however, indicate the involvement of blockade of neuronal uptake systems for norepinephrine and serotonin and blockade of many receptors for neurotransmitters. These properties of antidepressants can explain some of their adverse effects and certain interactions with other drugs.\r"
