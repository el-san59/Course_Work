  ".W": "In three patients with cat scratch disease the liver was affected. All three had high fever (39 degrees C) for more than 3 weeks. Two of them had no peripheral adenopathy. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed focal hepatic defects in two patients and periportal and periaortic adenopathy in the third. At laparotomy, there were nodules on the liver surfaces of all patients and histological examination revealed necrotising granulomata. The Warthin-Starry silver stain showed organisms consistent in appearance with the cat scratch bacillus in the liver and a periaortic lymph node of one patient, in the liver of the second patient, and in the axillary lymph node of the third. In all three patients the clinical findings and radiological abnormalities improved without specific therapy. A review of the surgical pathology files of Washington University revealed only two other cases of granulomatous hepatitis in children over a 6-year period. These findings indicate that cat scratch disease should now be included in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous hepatitis, at least in children. The absence of peripheral adenopathy in two of the three patients with granulomatous hepatitis suggests that the clinical spectrum of cat scratch disease may be broader than previously appreciated.\r"

  ".W": "In several syndromes sudden death is associated with a long Q-T interval on the electrocardiogram. Current treatment is aimed at correcting a notional imbalance of cardiac sympathetic drive. Although this approach can be effective, the primary disorder may be a defect in the cellular mechanism that alters the length of the ventricular action potential, and hence the Q-T interval, in response to a change of heart rate. Such defects may be underdiagnosed because the long Q-T syndromes are defined simply in terms of a prolonged Q-T interval, without consideration of the fact that susceptibility to arrhythmias is likely to be due, not to a lengthened Q-T per se, but to an absence or alteration of the normal Q-T shortening in response to an increase of heart rate. People susceptible to R-on-T related arrhythmias could be identified by measurement of the dependence of the Q-T interval on heart rate and how quickly the Q-T interval adapts to a change in rate.\r"

The most frequent sites were duodenum in 29, pancreatic ampulla in 10, and stomach in 7. These findings confirm an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal cancer in the polyposis patient, particularly distal to the pylorus, and support an adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Regular surveillance of the upper gastrointestinal tract is essential in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.\r"

  ".W": "There are two types of spinal deformity, lordosis and kyphosis, and they are mutually exclusive at the same site. Lordosis is rotationally unstable and buckles to the side with growth and spinal flexion, producing scoliosis and changes in transverse plane geometry as secondary phenomena. Kyphosis is a uniplanar deformity arising behind the axis of spinal column rotation and it does not buckle. Spinal balance in the sagittal plane is delicate and in the normal child during adolescence both idiopathic scoliosis and idiopathic kyphosis can easily develop. The development and progression of spinal deformities can be explained in biological and mechanical terms. Any condition in which the critical load to the spine is reduced will favour the production and progression of a spinal deformity. Neuromuscular factors in idiopathic scoliosis are additive and not causative.\r"

Each manoeuvre was used up to three times in an attempt to terminate an induced tachycardia and was judged to be effective if it terminated two out of the three induced episodes. The Valsalva manoeuvre in the supine position was effective in 19 (54%), right carotid sinus massage in 6 (17%), left carotid sinus massage in 2 (5%), and the diving reflex in 6 (17%) cases. 4 of the 6 patients who responded to right carotid sinus massage and all patients who responded to the diving reflex also responded to the Valsalva manoeuvre. The Valsalva manoeuvre while standing was effective in 9 (20%) patients only. Patients in whom the manoeuvres terminated the tachycardias were significantly younger than those who did not respond (median age: 30 vs 45 years, p less than 0.01). Physical manoeuvres were much more successful in terminating atrioventricular re-entry tachycardias (19/24) than atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardias (3/11, p less than 0.01). Efficacy of the manoeuvres was related to their bradycardic effect in sinus rhythm.\r"

The extent of thermal damage can be controlled by a choice of laser wavelength, irradiance, and exposure duration. The effect of exposure duration has been studied in vivo by using CO2 lasers with pulse widths that vary from 2 microseconds to 50 msec. Pulse widths of 50 msec, typical of a shuttered, continuous-wave CO2 laser, produce damage regions 750 micron wide in normal guinea pig skin; the use of a 2-microseconds-long pulse reduced this damage zone to as little as 50 micron. Using 2-microseconds-long pulses, in vitro studies showed that the minimum zone of thermal damage varied significantly with tissue type. The thermal denaturation of these tissues has been studied and correlated with damage. The effect of denaturation temperature and pulse duration on the width of the damage zone is explained by a simple model.\r"

The present study was undertaken to evaluate the relative zone of coagulation in acute laser wounds created in continuous-wave (CW), chop-wave (CPW), and super pulse wave (SPW) modes. The damage from single-point impact sites and incisions was compared in a guinea pig model. Animals were anesthetized with pentobarbital, and wounds were created with a 125-mm handpiece in focus (0.2-mm spot size) on dorsal and flank skin sites with the Sharplan 743 and 1100 CO2 lasers (Sharplan, Ltd., Allendale, NJ). Point impacts of CW and CPW were compared at power levels of 5, 10, 25, 40, 60, and 80 W at time durations of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 seconds. Incisions of 3.0 cm were created at 25 W in CW, CPW, and SPW modes. Histologic sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and Van Giesen elastin stains were evaluated by a single observer (R.J.L.). Zones of coagulation for the point-impact study varied from 79 to 257 +/- 66 (SD) micron in width with no significant differences between any of the wounds. Greater thermal damage (coagulation) occurred as the time interval increased. The zones of coagulation in the incision study were 309 +/- 83 (SD) micron for CW, 238 +/- 51 (SD) micron for SPW1 (743), 260 +/- 79 (SD) micron for CPW, and 194 +/- 56 (SD) micron for SPW2 (1100). These results are significant to the P less than 0.01 level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The present study was undertaken to investigate whether the cure rate achieved by a single laser treatment could be improved by adding topical 5% 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Twenty patients with extensive genital condylomata were treated with laser alone. Twenty patients comparable to the first group in age, number, size, and distribution of the condylomata were treated by laser and 5-FU. The first application of 5% 5-FU cream was carried out at the end of the laser treatment by the surgeon in the operating room. The patients were instructed to apply 5-FU cream once weekly to the vulva and once every two weeks to the vagina by using an applicator filled to one-third with 5-FU cream. Seven patients (35%) without 5-FU were found to have persistent condylomata at the first follow-up examination eight to 12 weeks after the single laser treatment. Two additional patients were noted to have disease six and nine months after laser treatment. The combination of laser and 5-FU failed in two cases (10%), both identified at the first visit. The difference is statistically significant (P less than .025, chi-square test). Two patients exposed to 5-FU experienced chemical vulvitis. It is concluded that the combination of a single laser treatment and 5-FU has acceptable side effects and results in a higher cure rate than a single laser treatment without 5-FU.\r"

A final 12-min self-paced \"performance\" ride was performed on an isokinetic ergometer (Fitron) interfaced with a computer to provide total work output. A water placebo (WP) was used as a control. Each 12-min ride was followed by 3-min rest, during which a drink was consumed (8.5 ml.kg-1; mean total = 1,336 ml.2 h-1). Blood samples were taken at 0, 25, 55, 85, and 115 min for blood glucose analysis. Following the performance ride, gastric residue was obtained by intubation and aspiration. Of the original 1,336 ml ingested during each trial, the volumes emptied by the stomach for the four trials were 1,306 +/- 76, 1,262 +/- 82, 1,288 +/- 75, and 1,278 +/- 77 ml (+/- SE) for WP, CHO-5, CHO-6, and CHO-7.5, respectively. Only the volume in the CHO-5 trial was significantly different from WP. The performance data showed that in all of the CHO trials, significantly more work was produced compared to the WP trial (CHO-5 = 1.98 +/- 0.09 x 10(5) Nm vs WP = 1.83 +/- 0.11 x 10(5) Nm). There were no significant differences in performance between any of the CHO trials.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study evaluated these factors in 100 female intercollegiate athletes in various sports, and in 66 non-athletes. All subjects had determinations of hemoglobin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation. Athletes reported on diet, menses, and symptoms. Athletes and coaches described mood and performance. Iron-deficient athletes were treated with iron; others received placebo. The same data were collected at season's end. Initially 31/100 (31%) athletes had iron deficiency (ferritin less than 12 ng.ml-1; transferrin saturation less than 16%, or both) compared to 30/66 (45.5%) controls (not statistically significant). Compared to normal athletes, iron-deficient athletes did not have more symptoms of iron deficiency or differences in mood state, but they considered their performance to be worse (P less than 0.05). Their total iron intakes were similar, as were menstrual blood losses. At re-evaluation, 7/45 (15.6%) initially normal athletes were iron-deficient; 14/22 (63.6%) initially iron-deficient athletes were normal. Athletes receiving an iron supplement and their coaches did not report a greater improvement in performance or mood than athletes receiving a placebo. Female college athletes frequently had iron deficiency that could be successfully treated during the season, while some untreated normal athletes became iron-deficient. Iron deficiency and its treatment had no significant impact on symptoms or mood, but affected subjective assessment of performance.\r"

Immediately after the exercise, there was an increase in serum PTH levels of the same magnitude as the maximal rise during a hypocalcemic test. The rise in PTH was not related to changes in serum electrolytes, but was significantly correlated to an increase in serum myoglobin, indicating that those who performed the largest amount of work also experienced the greatest stimulus for secretion of PTH. There were no significant changes of the serum total calcium and only a small initial rise of the magnesium concentrations. Serum phosphate levels were greatly reduced and gradually returned during recovery. This study extends previous observations, from short-term investigations, that physical activity stimulates secretion of PTH.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined the effects of chronic surgical ventricular sympathectomy on the relationships between left ventricular mechanical performance, coronary blood flow, and exercise workload in sham-operated control dogs and dogs which had been ventricular sympathectomized 8 wk earlier. During exercise, left ventricular global contractile state was less in sympathectomized ventricles than in control ventricles, as indicated by reduced systolic pressure and maximal rate of pressure generation. Regional contractile shortening was not different. Heart rate was significantly elevated in sympathectomized ventricles. Therefore, peak systolic pressure-heart rate product and tension-time index were not different in sympathectomized ventricles compared to control ventricles. However, at each level of exercise, mean coronary flow in sympathectomized ventricles was reduced by about 50% compared to control values. The slopes of coronary flow on pressure-rate product and tension-time index were also reduced. No difference in left ventricular oxygen extraction between control and sympathectomized hearts were observed. Thus, chronic ventricular sympathectomy altered the relationships between coronary flow and oxygen consumption, on the one hand, and ventricular oxygen-dependent performance and whole-body exercise level, on the other hand.\r"

Thirty-eight females (aged 18 to 35 yr) participated in the study, with 19 subjects in the training group and 19 in a control group. Both a specific and general training response was observed at the conclusion of the 5-wk training period. As a result of training, during peak arm exercise, significant increases (P less than 0.05) were observed for oxygen uptake (VO2), ventilation, cardiac output, stroke volume, arterial-venous oxygen difference, cumulative work, and total performance time. During peak leg exercise following arm training, significant increases (P less than 0.05) were observed for VO2, ventilation, cardiac output, cumulative work, and total performance time. Standardized partial regression coefficients were used to examine the relative influence of the metabolic and circulatory components which define VO2. Prior to training during arm work, the arterial-venous oxygen difference accounted for the largest proportion of variance in VO2; but after training, stroke volume contributed the largest portion of variance. On the other hand, during leg exercise, stroke volume accounted for the largest portion of variation in leg VO2 both before and after arm training. The data suggest that endurance arm training as prescribed in this study elicits significant circulorespiratory function adaptations to support improved performance in both arm and leg work. Further, the findings suggest both a specific and general training effect, with the more dominant effect specific to arm work.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

On the average, the mean AS exceeded the mean CS by 10 to 11 mm Hg, while the mean AD exceeded the average fourth and fifth CD by 5 and 13 mm Hg, respectively. During incremental exercise, AS, CS, AD, and fourth-phase CD increased, while fifth-phase CD decreased. We also measured intra-arterial blood pressure in nine young adult men smokers during 1-min incremental cycle exercise. In both groups, the average intra-arterial blood pressures increased in a relatively linear fashion from rest to maximal exercise: AS change = 74 +/- 5 mm Hg (SE) and AD change = 28 +/- 3 mm Hg for young men; AS change = 59 +/- 5 mm Hg and AD change = 12 +/- 3 mm Hg for middle-aged men. In this population of middle-aged smokers, intra-arterial mean blood pressure during exercise approximated diastolic plus 2/5 pulse pressure for intra-arterial measures or diastolic plus 1/2 pulse pressure for cuff measures rather than the traditional formula of diastolic plus 1/3 pulse pressure.\r"

Results were compared with similar data from a hot-dry (48 degrees C, 15% relative humidity) environment. No fluid replacement was provided during either of these sessions. In each environment, the older women stored more heat as evidenced by a higher rectal temperature response, but there were no inter-group differences in skin temperature or percent maximal heart rate. Four of the older women were unable to complete either the hot-dry or the warm-humid exposure, although they completed the full 2 h during acclimation sessions when water was provided ad libitum. In the hot-dry environment, the younger women's whole body and local sweat rates were significantly higher than those of the older women; in the warm-humid environment, there was no age-related difference in sweat rate. When local skin temperature and wettedness were artificially elevated, both groups exhibited the same pattern and rate of sweating. Percent decrease in plasma volume was greater for the older women in both conditions, but significantly so only in the warm-humid environment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effects of age on the choice of speed of walking, stride length, and step frequency were described for 289 males and 149 females aged 19 to 102 yr. These subjects were asked to walk at three self-selected paces (slow, normal, and fast) over an 80-m indoor course. Sixty-two years coincided with an accelerated decline in speed of walking. Before 62 yr, there was a 1 to 2% per decade decline in normal walking speed. After 63 yr, females showed a 12.4% per decade decrease and males showed a 16.1% per decade decrease. The eldest group (63 yr and older) had a significantly slower speed of walking and smaller step length than the younger groups (19 to 39 and 40 to 62 yr) for all paces. Heart rate at the three paces was not changed across age. In a multiple regression analysis, the only significant independent variable for walking speed at all three paces was (age), which accounted for 19 to 38% of the variance. When the population was divided into two age ranges (19 to 62 and 63 to 102 yr), walking speed was associated with height before 62 yr and with height and age after 62 yr.\r"

Five males and three females (age 30 to 56 yr) ran for 30 min on a treadmill (0% grade) at a self-selected pace (8.9 to 13.7 km.h-1), under randomized conditions of: (i) unloaded weights; (ii) hand weights; (iii) ankle weights; and (iv) hand + ankle weights. Respiratory gas exchange determinations, heart rates, and sagittal view film clips were obtained at selected time intervals. Highest energy expenditures and heart values were obtained for the fully loaded condition, with intermediate values measured for independent hand- and ankle-weighted trials. Increased energy expenditure due to loading ranged from 5 to 8%. Lower extremity kinematics were unaffected by loading. Angular velocity and excursion of the arm segments was significantly (P less than 0.05) reduced when hand weights alone were carried. The results indicate that commercial claims of marked increases in energy expenditure during running with hand/ankle weights are exaggerated. It appears that the small actual increases in energy expenditure, the potential for increased impact forces, and the relative discomfort of carrying weights discredit running with hand and/or ankle weights as a desirable exercise alternative.\r"

Paired PTRs were administered using inter-tap intervals of 0, 25, 50, 75, 150, and 300 ms, with the left leg reflex elicited first, followed by a right leg PTR. A force transducer secured at the ankle was used to measure peak force, time to peak force, and reflex latency. In the unilateral condition, significant differences (P less than 0.05) existed between athletic groups, with the sprint-trained athletes exhibiting greater peak force, faster time to peak force, and faster reflex latency than the endurance athletes. Significant differences (P less than 0.05) also existed for the conditioned reflex. There was a slight depression in reflex parameters in the untrained and sprint-trained groups up to an interval of 50 ms. At later intervals (greater than 50 ms), a marked enhancement occurred in all groups for all dependent measures studied. This longer latency excitatory effect persisted until the 150 ms interval. These differences in both simple and conditioned reflexes in individuals trained for endurance and sprint activities may reflect inherent differences in muscle-tendon stiffness or neural organization.\r"

Six experienced weightlifters, three skilled and three less skilled, performed the double-knee-bend execution of the pull in Olympic weightlifting, a movement which lasted almost 1 s. Analysis-of-variance statistics were performed on selected peak and average values of power generated by the three skilled subjects as they lifted three loads (69, 77, and 86% of their competition maximum). The results indicated that the skilled subjects lifted heavier loads by increasing the average power, but not the peak power, about the knee and ankle joints. In addition, the changes with load were more subtle than a mere quantitative scaling and also seemed to be associated with a skill element in the form of variation in the duration of the phases of power production and absorption. Similarly, statistical differences (independent t-test) due to skill did not involve changes in the magnitude of power but rather the temporal organization of the movement. Thus, the ability to successfully execute the double-knee-bend movement depends on an athlete's ability to both generate a sufficient magnitude of joint power and to organize the phases of power production and absorption into an appropriate temporal sequence.\r"

Females were slower than males and tetraplegics slower than paraplegics over all distances. Tetraplegics did not show any significant change in speed over distance. Significant linear and quadratic trends over distance were noted for male paraplegics due to a generally decreasing speed with duration of the race and a peak speed at 200 m, respectively. Male paraplegics had a faster speed in the marathon compared to their longest track event, reflecting the greater speeds attainable during downhill wheeling.\r"

Measurements were made of peak pressure, time from pressure rise to switch-marked initiation of body movement, and time from the movement to peak pressure. The highest ITP and IAP occurred during VM (22.2 +/- 6.0 and 26.6 +/- 6.7 kPa, respectively) with one individual reaching 36.9 kPa (277 mm Hg) IAP. In ascending order of peak ITP during the highest resistance sets, the activities were SR, BP, VJ, DJ, DL, BL, LP, and VM, while the order for IAP was BP, VJ, DJ, BL, DL, LP, SR, and VM. Pressures significantly (P less than 0.05) increased with amount of weight lifted, rising before and peaking after the weight moved. IAP generally rose earlier and was of greater magnitude than ITP. For the jumps, pressure rose and diminished before the feet lost contact with the ground. Drop-jump height did not affect pressure. Correlation of pressure with weight lifted was fair to good for most activities.\r"

  ".W": "Autism is a neurologic disorder that severely impairs social, language, and cognitive development. Whether autism involves maldevelopment of neuroanatomical structures is not known. The size of the cerebellar vermis in patients with autism was measured on magnetic resonance scans and compared with its size in controls. The neocerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII were found to be significantly smaller in the patients. This appeared to be a result of developmental hypoplasia rather than shrinkage or deterioration after full development had been achieved. In contrast, the adjacent vermal lobules I to V, which are ontogenetically, developmentally, and anatomically distinct from lobules VI and VII, were found to be of normal size. Maldevelopment of the vermal neocerebellum had occurred in both retarded and nonretarded patients with autism. This localized maldevelopment may serve as a temporal marker to identify the events that damage the brain in autism, as well as other neural structures that may be concomitantly damaged. Our findings suggest that in patients with autism, neocerebellar abnormality may directly impair cognitive functions that some investigators have attributed to the neocerebellum; may indirectly affect, through its connections to the brain stem, hypothalamus, and thalamus, the development and functioning of one or more systems involved in cognitive, sensory, autonomic, and motor activities; or may occur concomitantly with damage to other neural sites whose dysfunction directly underlies the cognitive deficits in autism.\r"

This study was designed to determine the efficacy of transferrin saturation as a screening tool for hemochromatosis and to assess the frequency of homozygosity for the HLA-linked hemochromatosis gene in a healthy population. We screened 11,065 presumably healthy blood donors (5840 men and 5225 women). Donors with transferrin saturations of 62 percent or more after an overnight fast were considered potential homozygotes and were asked to undergo liver biopsy and pedigree analysis. The frequency of values for transferrin saturation of 62 or higher in men was 0.008 and in women 0.003. Thirty-eight persons with values higher than 62 were studied in detail; 35 underwent liver biopsy. Liver iron stores ranged from normal to markedly increased. Twelve siblings with an identical HLA match to a proband underwent liver biopsy, and 11 had increased liver iron stores. According to likelihood analysis of the pedigrees, 26 of the 38 probands were homozygotes, and 12 were heterozygotes. The estimated frequency of homozygosity was based on the data in men, because the threshold value of 62 for the transferrin saturation identified only half as many female homozygotes as expected. The frequency of homozygosity was 0.0045, corresponding to a gene frequency of 0.067. The value of population screening is demonstrated in these studies by the detection of homozygotes before clinical manifestations of hemochromatosis occur.\r"

  ".W": "When an incompetent mentally disabled person has no family member or guardian available, obtaining informed consent for major medical treatment usually requires a court order--an often time-consuming, formal, and expensive process that does not provide for much substantive review of the decision about treatment. Consequently, there is a temptation to circumvent the requirement that informed consent be obtained for treatment of the residents of institutions as well as of those in community mental-health and mental-retardation programs. Under a new pilot program established by the New York State legislature, volunteer committees are empowered to make decisions about medical care in such cases. The law protects physicians from liability when they rely on the committees' decisions. The results of the program after one year indicate that this is an effective approach, which provides quick yet careful individualized decisions, in an informal and accessible forum. Advocates for the mentally disabled and health care providers agree that this approach is preferable to the judicial process for making decisions about medical care for incompetent mentally disabled persons. This type of program may prove workable for other groups of incompetent people who lack family members or guardians to act as surrogate decision makers.\r"

  ".W": "To explain the hematologic deterioration occasionally observed during interferon therapy, we assayed serum specimens from 51 patients with hairy-cell leukemia receiving treatment with recombinant interferon alfa-2a for the presence of anti-interferon antibodies. After a median of seven months of therapy, anti-interferon antibodies were found in 31 patients. Fifteen of these patients had only non-neutralizing antibodies, but antibody from the other 16 neutralized the antiviral effects of recombinant interferon alfa-2a in vitro. In no case, however, did neutralizing antibody inhibit the antiviral effects of purified natural interferon alfa. Clinical resistance to interferon of various degrees was present in 6 of 16 patients with neutralizing antibodies; the remaining 10 patients and all 20 patients without antibody continue to respond after a minimum of two years of therapy. In all the patients with interferon resistance, antibody was present when it developed. These data suggest that the development of clinical resistance to interferon alfa-2a in hairy-cell leukemia is not necessarily related to an altered cellular response to interferon. Treatment with other interferons, such as purified natural interferon alfa, may be useful in patients with clinically important neutralizing antibodies against interferon alfa-2a.\r"

  ".U": "88216752\r", 
  ".W": "Proliferation of vascular smooth-muscle cells occurs during the development of atherosclerosis and the remodeling of arteries that accompanies chronic systemic or pulmonary hypertension. To help define the signals that initiate this abnormal growth, we cultured smooth-muscle cells from human atherosclerotic plaques. These cells (n = 9) released material into their culture medium that stimulated the proliferation of aortic smooth-muscle cells to a mean (+/- SD) level 5.1 +/- 1 times that in control medium. Part of this activity was due to molecules that resemble a mitogen first isolated from platelets and known as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), since these cells released PDGF measured in a radioreceptor assay (355 +/- 117 pg per milliliter per 48 hours; n = 6) and since anti-PDGF antibody neutralized 38 +/- 7 percent of this mitogenic activity (range, 13 to 60 percent; n = 6 carotid-plaque isolates). Two human genes encode distinct PDGF subunits that form dimers in different combinations to create biologically active PDGF. Cells cultured from human atheroma contained mRNAs for the PDGF A chain (16 of 17 isolates) but none (of 13) that encoded PDGF B chain (the c-sis proto-oncogene product). We conclude that smooth-muscle cells from diseased human arteries can secrete mitogenic activity, some of which resembles PDGF, and that these cells express the gene for the PDGF A chain selectively. This capacity to produce an endogenous, potentially self-stimulatory (autocrine) growth factor may help to explain how replication of smooth-muscle cells can begin, even while the endothelial barrier remains morphologically intact, early in atherogenesis.\r"

As we expected, the insured had much greater access than the uninsured, but among the insured there were substantial disparities in access to care. Insured adults of working age were 3.5 times as likely (95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 4.4) as the elderly to have needed supportive medical services (including medications and supplies) but not to have received them, and 3.4 times (2.3 to 4.4) as likely to have had major financial difficulties because of illness. Among insured, working-age adults, the poor were 4.4 times (3.5 to 5.3) as likely as those who were not poor to have needed supportive services but not to have received them, and 5.2 times (3.6 to 6.8) as likely to have had major financial problems because of illness. Apart from insurance status and income, blacks were 1.7 times (1.1 to 2.2) as likely as whites to have needed supportive services but not to have received them. Hispanics with a medical illness were 2.2 times (1.3 to 3.2) as likely as whites not to have seen a physician within the past year. We conclude that insured, working-age adults have less access to medical care than the elderly, and that poor, black, or Hispanic persons in this group are at risk for even greater problems with access to care. Current policy strategies are unlikely to improve the ability of these groups to obtain care.\r"

One form of short-term synaptic depression lasting minutes can be evoked by the peptide Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-amide (FMRFamide), and is mediated by the lipoxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid. We report here using cell culture, that the same monosynaptic sensory-to-motor component of the gill withdrawal reflex can also undergo long-term synaptic depression lasting 24 h after five applications of FMRFamide over a 2-h period. The long-term depression evoked by FMRFamide is transmitter-specific. Dopamine or low-frequency stimulation of sensory neurons, which also produce short-lasting synaptic depression in vivo, failed to evoke a long-term change. As is the case for long-term presynaptic facilitation of this connection with serotonin, the long-term depression, but not the short-term, can be blocked when applications of FMRFamide are given in the presence of anisomycin, a reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis. Thus, heterosynaptic depression parallels heterosynaptic facilitation in having a long-term as well as a short-term form, and in both cases the long-term modulation requires the synthesis of gene products not essential for the short-term changes.\r"

  ".W": "The segregation of voltage-dependent sodium channels to specialized regions of the neuron is crucial for propagation of an action potential. Studies of their lateral mobility indicate that sodium channels are freely mobile on the neuronal cell body but are immobile at the axon hillock, presynaptic terminal and at focal points along the axon. To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate sodium channel topography and mobility, we searched for specific proteins from the brain that associate with sodium channels. Here we show that sodium channels labelled with 3H-saxitoxin (STX) are precipitated in the presence of exogenous brain ankyrin by anti-ankyrin antibodies and that 125I-labelled ankyrin binds with high affinity to sodium channels reconstituted into lipid vesicles. The cytoplasmic domain of the erythrocyte anion transporter competes for the latter interaction. Neither the neuronal GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor channel complex nor the dihydropyridine (DHP) receptor bind brain ankyrin. The results indicate that brain ankyrin links the voltage-dependent sodium channel to the underlying cytoskeleton and may help to maintain axolemmal membrane heterogeneity and control sodium channel mobility.\r"

  ".W": "Steroid hormone receptors belong to a family of nuclear receptors that trigger transcriptional activation of target genes by specific binding to DNA recognition sequences, usually located in the 5'-flanking region of the target gene. Nuclear receptors appear to be segmented proteins and extensive structure-function analyses have attempted to elucidate the functional significance of individual segments. Two of these regions have been defined as the domains responsible for recognition of responsive elements of target genes (region C) and hormone binding (region E) (refs 2-7). But the functional significance of the N-terminal region (A/B), which diverges extensively even for a given receptor between different species, has remained obscure. We have previously cloned, expressed and analysed the chicken progesterone receptor (cPR) (ref. 8). This receptor and its human homologue from T47D breast cancer cells are unique among the steroid hormone receptors in that two forms, A and B, are present in equal amounts in cytosolic extracts, the latter having the higher molecular weight. For the chicken progesterone receptor, we have presented evidence suggesting that the cPR form A corresponds to an N-terminally truncated form of B (ref. 8). Here we report on the functional difference between the forms A and B in the transcriptional activation of two target genes.\r"

Employing psychophysical methods, we found that occlusion-related geometric rules, which constrain the relationship between the direction of motion and the order and asynchrony of eyes, are implemented at early stages of cortical visual processing.\r"

Clusters of intramembranous particles, visible by freeze-fracture electron microscopy and presumed to represent water channels, appear on apical membranes in parallel with increased transepithelial water flow. In the collecting duct, these clusters are located in clathrin-coated pits which are subsequently internalized. There has been no direct evidence, however, that subcellular membranes in vasopressin-sensitive epithelia contain functional water channels. In this report, we have used fluorophores that are sensitive to volume and do not pass through membranes to label and to measure directly the osmotic water permeability of endocytosed vesicles isolated from renal papilla. We present direct evidence that vasopressin induces the appearance of a population of endocytic vesicles whose limiting membranes contain water channels.\r"

In single cell eukaryotes the GPI group appears to be the predominant form of membrane attachment, and in vertebrates a substantial minority of molecules have this anchor including cell surface hydrolytic enzymes, antigens and cell adhesion molecules. Analysis of different GPI anchors suggests they share common structural features including linkage to the COOH group of the terminal amino acid via ethanolamine phosphate, the presence of phosphatidylinositol lipid and a glycan between the bridging ethanolamine phosphate and the lipid. In the case of the Trypanosoma brucie variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) the full structure of the GPI anchor has been determined and this provides a prototype for comparison with other molecules. We now report the structure of the GPI anchor of rat brain Thy-1 glycoprotein. It has an identical backbone to the VSG anchor but shows significant differences in side chain moieties.\r"

Transient CNS dysfunction was reported by 25/80 (32%; 95% confidence interval, 21 to 44%). In most (15) only vision was affected, but ten (13%; 6 to 23%) reported nonvisual deficits. In nine of these ten, loss of power, balance, or coordination was noted, sometimes with other symptoms (visual in two), and the tenth subject had speech arrest. Seven of the ten had more than one episode. Episodes in these ten individuals began at age less than 30 in four, 30 to 34 in five, 35 to 39 in none, and 40 to 44 in one. The reported frequency of migraine was nonsignificantly higher in patients with nonvisual (4/10, 40%) or visual (7/15, 47%) episodes than in respondents without episodes (12/55, 22%; chi 2(2) = 4.3). Except for inflammatory bowel disease in one respondent, no obvious cause of the nonvisual episodes was evident from follow-up structured interviews. Five of the ten with nonvisual loss and eight of the 15 with isolated visual symptoms thus had no obvious cause for their episodes. Follow-up is limited to a median of 5 years, but none of the 25 has had any residual deficit or chronic neurologic disorder, suggesting that these relatively common episodes of CNS deficit are benign. As new, hyperacute stroke therapies emerge, efforts to distinguish these episodes from true, early strokes will become increasingly important.\r"

We found no risk factor other than age or oral contraceptive use in six patients. One patient died in the acute phase. During follow-up (45.6 months), the stroke or death rate was 7.4% per year. Delayed pain developed in three patients and abnormal movements in three. Late disability was mainly secondary to persisting neuropsychological dysfunction (thalamic dementia).\r"

The woman had many brainstem TIAs and strokes during 3 years. Two other patients had SAH and unilateral dissections. Intracranial VA dissection causes four overlapping syndromes: (1) brainstem infarcts are usually due to subintimal dissection extending into the basilar artery, affect younger patients, and often are single fatal events; (2) SAH is due to subadventitial or transmural dissection; (3) aneurysms cause mass effect on the brainstem and lower cranial nerves; and (4) chronic dissections due to connective tissue defects cause extensive bilateral aneurysms and repeated TIAs, small strokes, and SAH.\r"

Most patients were in their fourth or fifth decade of life, and women predominated. Forty-eight percent of the patients were hypertensive. Angiographic evidence of fibromuscular dysplasia was noted in one only. Brainstem ischemic symptoms (usually a lateral medullary syndrome) and ipsilateral occipital headache and neck pain (often preceding but sometimes associated with or following the brainstem ischemic event) were the most common clinical findings. The angiographic features in decreasing order of frequency were luminal stenosis (often irregular and tapered), aneurysm, occlusion, and intimal flap. On follow-up, most of the patients (88%) made complete or very good recoveries. Angiographic abnormalities either subsided or improved in 76%. Multivessel dissection (involvement of both vertebral arteries or one or both vertebral arteries and one or both internal carotid arteries) was noted in about two-thirds of the patients. This tendency of vertebral artery dissections to involve multiple cervicocephalic vessels concurrently, if not simultaneously, implies that four-vessel angiography should be attempted if a vertebral artery dissection is visualized. It also raises the possibility of an underlying arteriopathy that predisposes the vessel to dissection.\r"

Because this test induces semantic processing and coordinates encoding and retrieval for maximum recall, genuine memory deficits due to impairment of specific memory processes can be distinguished from apparent memory deficits due to use of inefficient strategies or impairment of other cognitive processes. Since genuine memory deficits in the elderly are usually associated with dementia, their identification is highly predictive of clinical dementia. The present study validates the use of enhanced cued recall as a screening test for dementia in 70 aged subjects. All but one person with a pure amnesia were correctly classified. Enhanced cued recall correctly classified 97% of the 120 subjects in this and the previous study. Enhanced cued recall shows learning not revealed by free recall, providing more accurate measurement of memory, and distinguishes demented from nondemented elderly more accurately than either free recall or recognition.\r"

Comparative amino acid levels were (mumol/g protein, mean +/- SEM): glutamate--spiking 109.8 +/- 1.8, nonspiking 87.4 +/- 2.0 (p less than 0.001); aspartate--spiking 15.2 +/- 0.9, nonspiking 12.2 +/- 0.5 (p less than 0.05); GABA--spiking 15.0 +/- 1.0, nonspiking 13.9 +/- 1.4 (NS); taurine--spiking 14.5 +/- 0.8, nonspiking 12.2 +/- 0.8 (NS); and glycine--spiking 11.5 +/- 0.8, nonspiking 7.4 +/- 0.6 (p less than 0.01).

The mean frequency of epileptiform spikes decreased during use of isoflurane, but not enflurane, compared with use of 70% N2O/O2 alone. Enflurane produced paroxysms of synchronous high-voltage spikes. The mean number of electrodes exhibiting spike activity decreased with isoflurane use and increased with enflurane use compared with use of 70% N2O/O2 alone. This preliminary study suggests that isoflurane can suppress epileptogenic tissue and that both isoflurane and enflurane can distort the ECoG, confounding accurate identification of the seizure focus. When used judiciously, however, enflurane may be a potent synchronizer and activator of the epileptogenic focus, making it easier to identify.\r"

Thirty-six patients with carefully documented clinical diagnosis of early AD (mean disease duration, 3.25 +/- 1.80 years) and 12 elderly healthy controls participated in rCBF studies using the 133Xe inhalation method. Whole-brain perfusion was significantly (p less than 0.001) lower in the AD group, and a characteristic perfusion deficit was consistently found in temporoparietal cortex of the AD patients. Discriminant analyses demonstrated over 90% correct classification of the two groups. Two subgroups of patients with mildest disease manifestations were equally well discriminated. The similarity of these findings to those in late stages, which have been validated neuropathologically, offers indirect confirmation of validity and specificity. These results suggest that rCBF procedures may provide an accurate and sensitive laboratory marker for early AD.\r"

Dementia was evident from a confirmed history of cognitive decline, memory loss, and personality change. CMRglc in the subject was compared with the mean obtained in 13 healthy younger DS subjects, aged 19 to 33 years. Test scores of general intelligence, visuospatial ability, language, and memory function showed poorer performance in the older subject compared with the younger group. Mean hemispheric CMRglc in the older DS subject was 28% less than in the young DS group, and marked hypometabolism was evident in parietal and temporal lobe association cortices. At autopsy, extensive neuropathology was noted, especially in the parietal and temporal cortical regions, more so than reported in DS subjects without documented dementia. This study is the first complete assessment of cerebral metabolism, neuropsychological competence, and neuropathology in a DS subject with a documented course of dementia, and demonstrates the superimposition of Alzheimer type dementia on previous mental retardation.\r"

  ".U": "88216989\r", 
  ".W": "Haloperidol exhibits a high affinity for a subclass of sigma- \"opiate\" binding sites which have a unique anatomic distribution and a unique drug selectivity pattern. These binding sites differ from phencyclidine-sensitive sigma-receptors and are found in many brain areas involved in the control of movement. 1,3-Di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), a highly selective ligand for the haloperidol-sensitive sigma-receptor, produced marked dystonia in rats after microinjection into the red nucleus, a motor area rich in this receptor. Haloperidol and another sigma-ligand [(+)-SKF 10,047] produced similar effects. On the other hand, clozapine, an antipsychotic drug which fails to bind to sigma-receptors and fails to induce movement disorders in humans, failed to induce these dystonic reactions in rats. Phencyclidine was also without effect, as were injections of the active compounds in sites distant to the red nucleus. Microinjections of DTG in the substantia nigra produced vigorous contralateral circling behavior at extremely low doses. These findings suggest that sigma-binding sites represent biologically functional receptors that are active in the neural control of movement. Since haloperidol (and many other antipsychotic drugs) exhibit an affinity for sigma-receptors which is at least equal to its affinity for dopamine receptors, these data raise the further possibility that sigma-receptors are involved in the motor side effects of antipsychotic drugs.\r"

Schwann cells accomplished successful developmental proliferation, migration, axonal ensheathment, basal lamina production, and subsequent cessation of proliferation, but failed in spiral lengthening and longitudinal growth. Internuclear distance was very short, resulting in marked Schwann cell hypercellularity. No supernumerary Schwann cells (onion bulbs) were found. No PNS myelin proteins (P0, P1, MAG) were detected by immunocytochemical methods, and the Schwann cells adopted many morphologic features characteristic of unmyelinated nerves. The defect appears to be an arrest in Schwann cell differentiation at the stages of mesaxon elongation and longitudinal growth.\r"

However, male patients in Queensland differed from their counterparts in the three cities by showing a greater tendency to develop a progressive disease course and, hence, more disability.

  ".W": "This study investigated the use of a one-week urinary diary in the evaluation of incontinent women. The sample consisted of 50 community-dwelling women, ages 55 years and older, ambulatory, and mentally intact, who were volunteers in a clinical trial on behavioral management for urinary incontinence. All subjects kept a urinary diary for two consecutive weeks. An analysis of the immediate (one-week) test-retest variability and correlations on weekly diurnal micturition frequency, nocturnal micturition frequency, and urinary incontinent episodes were performed in subjects with sphincteric incompetence alone (N = 34) and in those with detrusor instability with or without concomitant sphincteric incompetence (N = 16). In addition, information obtained on history was compared with that obtained from the diary. Diurnal micturition frequency, nocturnal micturition frequency, and number of incontinent episodes were highly reproducible and did not differ by urodynamic diagnosis. Test-retest correlations were highest with diurnal micturition frequency and incontinent episodes. Lower correlations were observed with nocturnal micturition frequency, with a significant difference observed between diagnostic groups. Although modest, significant relationships between data collected by history and diary were observed in the overall sample, but there were significant differences between diagnostic groups. The results indicate that a one-week diary is a reliable method for assessing the frequency of voluntary micturitions and involuntary episodes of urine loss.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical and urodynamic variables of 49 non-estrogen-supplemented and 23 estrogen-supplemented postmenopausal women with urinary incontinence were compared. We ascertained their estrogenic status via plasma estradiol and estrone levels, as well as from parabasal and superficial cell counts from both the urethra and vagina. The effect of estrogen supplementation, in conjunction with the effect of age and urodynamic diagnosis, was studied in relation to filling-phase urodynamic data and incontinence severity and outcome variables. Analysis of covariance was used. No direct effect of estrogen supplementation was noted on parameters of urethral function. In patients with detrusor instability, a borderline direct positive effect (P = .06) was noted in the volume needed to reach maximal cystometric capacity from the first sensation to void. For these patients, the magnitude of fluid loss was greater without estrogen supplementation. However, this difference did not reach statistical significance. Nocturia was significantly less frequent in the estrogen-supplemented groups (P = .04). Estrogen-supplemented patients had a higher incidence of positive bulbocavernosus reflex (P = .01). These observations suggest that hypoestrogenism may affect the sensory threshold of the lower urinary tract of incontinent postmenopausal women.\r"

The histologic characteristics associated with this lesion are also frequently encountered among undifferentiated large-cell, nonkeratinizing cervical carcinomas. In a review of all undifferentiated large-cell carcinomas of the cervix encountered at the University Hospital in Seattle, Washington, over an eight-year period, 29 cases appeared to display the characteristic histologic criteria described as typical for glassy cell carcinoma. All cases were stage Ib lesions, and 28 were treated by radical hysterectomy. The mean age was ten years younger than that of the usual patient treated at this institution with stage I carcinoma. Fourteen of these patients (45%) have developed recurrent carcinoma, and in all but one, the interval to recurrence was less than eight months. Only two have survived after second-line salvage therapy. The current survival rate among the 29 women is 55%. These observations suggest that the poor prognosis ascribed to the classically defined glassy cell carcinoma also holds true for this extended group of large-cell, undifferentiated cervical cancers that display similar histologic features and pursue a similarly aggressive clinical course.\r"

Mitotic counts of the tumor may vary among endometrial curettings, hysterectomy specimens, and metastatic lesions. When placental site trophoblastic tumor is diagnosed on endometrial curettage, a thorough metastatic workup should be undertaken. Because of this tumor's poor response to chemotherapy, a diagnosis of nonmetastatic placental site trophoblastic tumor should be followed by prompt hysterectomy.\r"

To assess whether this represents an overestimation because of the referral patterns of these institutions, a retrospective review was conducted at five hospitals in Nashville, Tennessee. In females 21 years of age and under, borderline or malignant ovarian neoplasms were identified in only eight (5.8%) of 137 individuals with ovarian enlargement and eight (9.8%) of 82 females with ovarian neoplasms. All six malignant neoplasms were of germ-cell origin. The borderline neoplasms were of epithelial origin, and occurred in females in their late teens. We conclude that the frequency with which ovarian enlargement represents malignancy in this age group appears to be much smaller than previously suggested. Nevertheless, because of the potential for malignant ovarian neoplasia in young females, the presence of an abdominal-pelvic mass requires prompt and thorough attention.\r"

Ten nonpregnant women were similarly evaluated with the automatic sphymomanometer and pulse oximeter. Six of 42 pregnant women (14.3%) developed the supine hypotensive syndrome (defined as a mean blood pressure decrease of 15 mmHg and a sustained increase in pulse of 20 beats per minute) when in the supine position. Nine of them (21.4%) met at least one of the criteria, but the majority (27 of 42, 64.3%) met neither criterion. None of the ten nonpregnant subjects had hypotension or tachycardia, although nine demonstrated blood pressure elevation after assuming the supine position. Significant oxygen desaturation did not occur in any patient, although three of six hypotensive patients had a transient 3-5% desaturation after supine rest. This study confirms that a significant percentage of patients in the third trimester are affected to some degree by supine hypotension. However, significant oxygen desaturation does not appear to occur.\r"

In addition, a laparoscopic approach resulted in a shorter convalescence (8.7 +/- 7.8 versus 25.7 +/- 16.2 days; P less than .01) and reduced postoperative analgesia requirements (0.84 +/- 2.3 versus 4.64 +/- 2.9 doses; P less than .01).

To investigate the presence of cryoprecipitates in Kawasaki syndrome, we studied sera from 25 children with acute Kawasaki syndrome. None of the subjects was treated with intravenous gamma-globulin. Cryoprecipitates were detectable in sera of 11 of 25 (44%) children studied. The mean (+/- SE protein concentration of the cryoprecipitates was 88.0 (+/- 20.2) micrograms/ml serum. Cryoprecipitates consisted primarily of IgG and IgM; no complement components were detected but highly sensitive methods were not used. The presence of cryoprecipitates in the serum of children with acute Kawasaki syndrome was associated with the subsequent development of coronary artery aneurysms detected by echocardiogram (P less than 0.05). There was no association between detectable cryoprecipitates and either peak platelet count or erythrocyte sedimentation rate. In one patient, measurement of cryoprecipitates in serial samples showed a reduction in concentrations that paralleled subsidence of disease activity. We speculate that cryoprecipitates may be a marker for increased risk of coronary aneurysm formation and may play a role in the pathogenesis of the cardiac disease in Kawasaki syndrome.\r"

A retrospective survey of immunized schoolchildren also showed efficacy of the vaccine. To confirm the efficacy of acellular vaccine a prospective case contact study was conducted. Of 35 unimmunized children 29 developed clinically diagnosed pertussis, and of 52 children who received two or more doses of the vaccine only two developed disease after the household exposure.

  ".W": "Newborn screening for sickle cell disease has been recommended as a method of decreasing patient mortality. However, its effectiveness in accomplishing this has not been reliably measured. To help determine the effectiveness, 10 years of experience in newborn screening have been summarized. The effects of early patient enrollment in a comprehensive treatment program on long-term morbidity and mortality are reported. From 1975 to 1985, 84,663 newborns were screened regardless of race or ethnic background. Bart's hemoglobin was present in 5%, hemoglobin AS in 2.6%, and hemoglobin AC in 0.75%. Excluding Bart's, approximately 3.6% of all newborns were carriers for hemoglobinopathy. Sickle cell disease occurred in 1:951 births (58 hemoglobin SS, 25 hemoglobin FSC, three hemoglobin S-beta +-thalassemia, and three hemoglobin S-beta O-thalassemia). In addition, one in every 4,233 newborns had a clinically significant thalassemia syndrome (eight hemoglobin FE, ten hemoglobin F only, two hemoglobin H). Compared with other newborn screening programs in California, (congenital hypothyroidism, 1:3,849; phenylketonuria 1:22,474, galactosemia 1:74,103), hemoglobinopathies are the most prevalent congenital disease. Eighty-one newborns with sickle cell disease were followed for 7.2 years. Patients experienced 513 hospitalizations, including 13 episodes of sepsis with or without meningitis and ten acute sequestration crises. The overall mortality rate for patients with sickle cell anemia diagnosed in the newborn period was 1.8%. In comparison, the clinical course of 64 patients with sickle cell anemia diagnosed after 3 months of age and followed for an average of 9.4 years was analyzed. Five of these patients died. In two of these, sickle cell anemia was diagnosed at the time of the death.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although both mothers' and fathers' ratings of infant temperament were correlated with variables reflecting sleep continuity, results for fathers were much more striking. Infants who required care giving during the night were rated as significantly more difficult and arrhythmic by fathers than by mothers. All infants awakened during the night. Some of them soothed themselves and returned to sleep; however, others signaled and required care giving interventions from their parents before returning to sleep. No differences in variables reflecting the biology of sleep distinguished \"signaling\" infants and \"self-soothing\" infants, although feedings at bedtime (breast or bottle) were more common in the signaling group.\r"

  ".W": "Two groups of 4-year-old children were examined by a dysmorphologist without knowledge of previous examination results or prenatal exposure and categorized as to whether or not they showed fetal alcohol effects. A priori classification of children into the two groups was on the basis of their mothers' self-report of drinking when interviewed during pregnancy. Children born to 108 mothers in a \"heavier\" drinking group (absolute alcohol concentration greater than or equal to 30 mL/d [1.0 oz/d]) were compared with a matched group of children born to 97 mothers whose average absolute alcohol concentration was less than 0.3 mL/d (0.01 oz/d). The percentage of children with fetal alcohol effects in the heavier drinking v the comparison group was 20.4% v 9.3%. When fetal alcohol effects were studied in relation to only the absolute alcohol concentration scores, there was a significantly greater chance of a child being classified as having fetal alcohol effects with increasing levels of alcohol exposure prior to recognition of pregnancy (P = .013). A logistic regression, run on the absolute alcohol concentration scores and other primary exposures, indicated that fetal alcohol effects classification was not significantly related to nicotine, caffeine, or marijuana but was significantly related to absolute alcohol concentration scores even after statistically adjusting for these other exposures (P = .002). Classification of fetal alcohol effects at 4 years of age was compared to a fetal alcohol effects classification obtained at birth by an independent dysmorphologist in a sample of 75 subjects examined at both ages, and 80% of the infants classified as having fetal alcohol effects at birth were classified as having fetal alcohol effects at 4 years of age.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The somewhat lower and delayed serologic response to live varicella vaccine as compared with the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella may have been due to the small amount of varicella vaccine virus used or to its degree of attenuation.

  ".W": "Previous studies of XXY boys suggest that they are at risk for certain communication disorders involving oral and written language. In this study, the language, reading, and spelling skills of a group of 14 XXY boys identified during neonatal cytogenetic screening were compared with those of a group of 15 control children. The two groups were matched for age, grade, race, parity, birth weight, parental age and education, and socioeconomic status. The mean age of the XXY group was 9 years 7 months and that of the control group was 9 years 3 months. The mean academic grade level for both groups was at the transition between third and fourth grade. There was selective reduction in verbal IQ scores for the XXY group and no significant differences apparent between groups for performance IQ scores. The decrease in verbal IQ was associated with a reduced full-scale IQ and also with significant problems in expressive language, auditory processing abilities, and auditory memory. Word-finding difficulties and problems in the production of syntax were major components of the specific expressive language deficit. Except for difficulties in the understanding of complex sentence structures, the receptive language skills of XXY boys did not differ significantly from those of the control group. These reductions in speech and language abilities correlated with decreased achievement by the XXY group on a variety of reading and spelling tasks. These results suggest that difficulty learning how to read and spell may be due to a preexistent language disability. Early attention to such expressive language problems may be essential to ameliorate secondary maladaptive behaviors due to chronic language-related learning disabilities.\r"

All deaths of children, seven to 364 days of age, occurring in a year were studied and the parents of the 357 infants dying of an infectious cause were interviewed, as were the parents of two neighborhood control infants for each case. Low birth weight infants (less than 2,500 g) were found, after allowing for confounding factors, to be 2.3 (90% confidence interval = 1.6 to 3.4) times more likely to die of an infection than those of higher birth weight. The odds ratios were 2.0 (1.1 to 3.6) for deaths due to diarrhea, 1.9 (1.0 to 3.6) for respiratory infections, and 5.0 (1.3 to 18.6) for other infections. These estimates of the risks associated with low birth weight are considerably lower than those from studies in developed countries.\r"

The term affinity index has been used to define the molarity of thiocyanate which leads to a reduction of 50% of the initial density. The serum from a group of patients with intrauterine rubella was compared with the serum from a group of deaf children, some of whom could have rubella, and a group of controls with antibody following natural infection. The results show that the affinity index of patients with rubella is significantly lower than that of controls.

Early milk volumes were related negatively to the delay between delivery and the initiation of milk expression (r = -.48, P less than .02).

In 13 blood culture pairs the same pathogens were found and had been obtained from the peripheral vein and the umbilical arterial line. Two pairs were positive for discrepant organisms. A total of 11 pairs were positive in one site only, with five positive from peripheral vein only and the other six from the umbilical arterial catheter. However, most of these single-site positive blood cultures were apparently true positives based on supporting laboratory data for infection. Contamination rates were 1.3% and 0.9% for peripheral vein and umbilical arterial catheter blood cultures, respectively. Thus, in sick neonates, the indwelling umbilical arterial line was an alternative and perhaps a preferred site for blood culture sampling.\r"

Abuse allegations with and without a concomitant custody or visitation dispute were compared. A custody or visitation dispute occurred in 12 (39%) of 31 sexual abuse complaints lodged against a parent. Allegedly abused children whose parents contested custody or visitation were significantly younger than those for whom custody or visitation was not an issue (5.4 v 7.8 years, P = .02). Sexual abuse allegations were substantiated less frequently when there was concomitant parental conflict (67% v 95%, nonsignificant) but were nevertheless substantiated more than half of the time.\r"

Because little attention has previously been directed to measurements of erythropoiesis in these patients, we prospectively examined hemoglobin concentration and RBC indices in 94 children and young adults with hemophilia during comprehensive clinic visits. Additional studies performed in many included serum transferrin saturation, ferritin, haptoglobin, and free erythrocyte protoporphyrin measurements. Hemoglobin concentrations were recorded as age-related percentile values. Hemophiliacs of all ages and degrees of severity often had lower than average values for hemoglobin; 31% had values less than the third percentile, 46% less than the tenth percentile, and 83% less than the mean value. Reduced hemoglobin percentile values were unrelated to age, severity of disease, or human immunodeficiency virus antibody status. Only five patients had an obvious cause for anemia. Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin values were usually normal, indicating that iron deficiency and anemia of chronic disease were uncommon. Although serum haptoglobin was reduced in 44% of the patients, reticulocyte count was infrequently increased. We conclude that hemoglobin values are frequently less than the mean normal values for age in hemophiliacs. Although frank anemia is common, it is usually mild and without obvious cause. Hemophiliac individuals with slightly reduced hemoglobin values probably do not routinely require detailed investigation for occult blood loss, iron deficiency, or inflammation.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective review of 214 children with nephrotic syndrome seen at Children's Medical Center and Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas throughout the 20-year period from 1967 to 1986, 62 cases of primary peritonitis were identified in 37 patients (17.3% rate). Streptococcus pneumoniae was the major pathogen, accounting for 38% of the cases. An additional 27% of patients had negative culture results but were clinically responsive to penicillin. Gram-negative organisms were cultured from only 3% of patients; 5% were caused by alpha-streptococci and 2% each by enterococcus and anaerobes. In 23% of cases the cause was unknown. Our findings differ from the recent trend in the literature in which Gram-negative organisms associated with these infections are increasingly implicated. The incidence and bacteriology of peritonitis do not appear to have changed significantly during the 20-year period. Clinically, peritonitis was characterized by abdominal pain (98%), fever (95%), rebound tenderness (85%), and nausea and vomiting (71%). A total of 79% of patients were either in relapse or receiving steroid therapy at the time peritonitis was diagnosed; 13% had infiltrates visible on their chest radiographs. Based on our data, it seems reasonable to initiate antimicrobial therapy in nephrotic children with suspected peritonitis using a combination of penicillin plus either an aminoglycoside or a cephalosporin. This regimen should continue until culture results are available, unless Gram-positive diplococci are identified in a Gram-stained specimen of peritoneal fluid, in which case penicillin alone should suffice.\r"

Despite reported cognitive impairments, patients vividly described anger, discomfort, resistance, and fear in response to the experience of physical restraint. The decision to restrain posed a conflict between protection of the patient and beliefs about professional behavior for the nursing staff. Lack of interdisciplinary collaboration in decisions to use a physical restraint was also apparent. The findings suggest that the use of physical restraint is not a benign practice and support the need for developing alternatives more consistent with professional practice and quality care.\r"

Mothers were from larger families. Never-married nonmothers were an only child, only daughter, or oldest daughter. The effect of historical and marital status on achievement of integrity during later years is suggested as somewhat more influential than motherhood status.\r"

Eight randomly selected Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with radio temperature-transmitters under general anesthesia. Timer-controlled cassette recorders recorded body temperature at predetermined intervals. To monitor activity, the rats were placed in individual metabolic cages equipped with infrared-sensitive locomotor activity monitors. Temperature was sampled hourly. Activity was measured continuously and summed every 15 minutes for sampling. Measurement was begun before surgery and continued from 12 to 20 days following surgery, depending on when the animals regained their typical rhythmic patterns. Temperature and activity rhythms were altered and uncoupled from external cues in a manner similar to that previously found in humans. The animals demonstrated individual variation in their return to presurgical activity levels. Six days after surgery, the rats experienced a second period of disrhythmic and decreased activity. Rats with the greatest activity phase-shifts took longest to return to presurgical activity levels. This suggests that the degree of circadian alteration following surgery is positively related to the time required for recovery and reentrainment of rhythmicity.\r"

However, these differences did not indicate polarization on this issue. The Qn group also exhibited a favorable position on qualitative methods, though to a lesser degree. All three groups favored combined qualitative-quantitative doctoral research preparation as ideal and advocated increased coverage of qualitative research in nursing journals.\r"

  ".W": "This article has outlined the need for clarification of home care nursing practice to retain the elements essential to professional practice. Home care that is nursing focused, based on concepts of community health nursing, and client/family centered forms the core of professional home care nursing. Technical services that are provided in the home should be clearly delineated so that consumers, payors, and practitioners can determine the roles and functions of the various providers. Professional home care, practiced not just by nursing but by all licensed providers, is practice driven. The boundaries of practice are determined by professional standards with a basis in scientific theory and research. The foundation for this type of practice is strong and should continue to be practiced in the future. Technical house call services, on the other hand, are product driven, often with a zeal for the bottom line profits that does not take into account what is the best product for a specific patient situation or how well that product has been tested. There is definitely a need for both services in delivering health care to people in their homes. It is also hoped that both areas of service can work together to facilitate the management of patient and family needs. It is important, though, to fully define the type and substance of care that is provided in the home setting. Without this ongoing clarification, home care will continue to be fragmented and interpreted differently by everyone involved.\r"

The level of knowledge and breadth of perspective demanded by the clinician, manager, and administrator in home care is complex and requires concentrated program development on the master's level and a strong integration of content and practicum experience for undergraduate students. Education must know its product line and be sensitive to the persistent trends and demands of the consumers of its graduates. Agencies must communicate the need for adequate preparation to the educational setting. A collaborative approach in resolving the supply and demand cycle for nurses capable of operating in and directing the resources of agencies can result in enhanced client outcomes in the home health industry.\r"

It is time to deliberately plan to change from the paper-shuffling tendency among supervisors toward supporting more people-oriented activity and to rediscover the pivotal role that supervisors have in keeping a community healthy, staff stimulated, and the agency solvent. Some summary points to consider in reshaping supervisory practice include: (1) redefine supervision to reflect what is desired, needed, and possible, (2) recognize the contribution from change theory and apply it, (3) recapture the commitment and philosophy of supervision from the past, (4) reward the supervisor commensurate with the scope of practice expected, (5) reverse selection of supervisors from preservers of territory to manager as idea entrepreneur, (6) respond to varying and dynamic models of supervisory practice, (7) recharge the supervisor through timely in-service programs, continuing education, and formal academic study, (8) require educational content and practice from colleges and universities that stimulate creative supervisory skills and improve job satisfaction, (9) respect the work of the supervisor and provide appropriate support to achieve success, (10) reconsider current supervisory models and expand opportunities for professional growth among staff, and (11) reshape the supervisory role from one of controller to facilitator and innovator.\r"

Third parties certainly were not as interested in what was documented then as they are today. Perhaps the state would admonish an agency about the fact that goals were missing in the charts, but no one talked about documentation being the key to reimbursement and agency survival. Needless to say, times have changed. Public health nurses are suffering these days because they are not only laboring to provide care to a group of patients who are older and sicker than they were in the past, but they are spending more hours each day writing about what they have seen and done. These nurses are haunted by the fear that they might omit a vital piece of information which would jeopardize both their licenses and reimbursement. New forms initiated by the federal government to improve screening for nonreimbursable care have been successful. They have helped to increase denials as well as the volume of paperwork necessary for writing up a Medicare case. Consequently, nurses are frustrated. Although they are writing more, the outcome is negative. Documentation is an essential part of care. It is a vehicle for communicating from one professional to another about the status and needs of the patient. In fact, the chart is often the only means to demonstrate that professional standards, state regulations, and the criteria for reimbursement were met. However, to the extent that charting significantly interferes with the amount of time nurses can spend with patients, it must be limited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Past and present research in the home care setting predicts future trends. Home care research studies will continue to reflect social and economic issues of the future since research and researchers do not exist in a vacuum but are influenced by their era. Because of the generalized concern about economic stability and health care costs and the heightened interest in home care, investigations related to nursing interventions, client outcomes, and reimbursement will increase. As researchers search to identify long-term, positive client outcomes, the role of physical and psychosocial environmental factors will receive greater attention. Clients, too, do not exist in a vacuum but reflect the family and support systems which do, or do not, surround them. For home care research to serve as the scientific base for practice, continuing and increasing collaboration must occur between nursing service and education. More joint appointments or shared positions are likely as blending occurs in researchers' roles and nursing service staff assume more responsibility for research projects. The struggles involved with financial support of home care research will not cease. Home care researchers will continue to compete for funding with other nursing, health care, and research investigators. Specific strategies will enhance funding opportunities for home care nursing. These include: (1) increasing methodologic soundness, (2) increasing sophistication of studies and investigators, (3) publicizing findings and benefits of projects, and (4) developing a successful history of obtaining funding and conducting studies. Research in the home care setting will thrive if it attracts more and more nurses with scientific skills similar to those identified by Sir Medawar: \"Among scientists are collectors, classifiers, and compulsive tidiers-up; many are detectives by temperament and many are explorers; some are artists and others artisans. There are poet-scientists and philosopher-scientists and even a few mystics.\"\r"

In general, conservative management with pharmacologic manipulation is the primary form of treatment. Surgical intervention, when indicated, offers a high success rate, particularly since the advent of the artificial urinary sphincter.\r"

For anatomic incontinence, excellent results are achieved with use of any of the retropubic or transvaginal suspension techniques that restore the bladder neck and proximal urethra to a high, fixed retropubic position. However, when the urethral sphincter is intrinsically damaged, mere restoration of position will fail to cure the problem. Such damage warrants use of a compression procedure that increases urethral resistance, such as one of the many sling techniques, implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter, or periurethral Teflon injection.\r"

  ".W": "High-performance anion-exchange (HPAE) chromatography under alkaline conditions (pH congruent to 13) has been found to efficiently separate neutral oligosaccharides (triose to undecaose) according to molecular size, sugar composition, and linkage of monosaccharide units. The method was able to resolve 1----3, 1----4, and 1----6 positional isomers of neutral oligosaccharides, which are defined as having the same number, type, sequence, and anomeric configurations of monosaccharides but differing in the linkage position of a single sugar. From correlating structural features of different oligosaccharides and retention times, we deduced that at least two factors are operative to determine the superior resolution of oligosaccharides by this type of chromatography: (i) the relative acidities of the hydroxyl groups and (ii) the accessibility of oxyanions of the oligosaccharides to the functional groups of the stationary phase. Splitting of peaks attributable to mutarotation was not observed. Reducing oligosaccharides were much more retained than their reduced counterparts. Linkage of Fuc(alpha 1-3) to GlcNAc of oligosaccharides markedly decreased retention times. Positional isomers of two branched monosaccharides, which differed by 1----6 and 1----4 linkages, were widely separated. The separation of 1----3 and 1----4 positional isomers of both tetrasaccharides and glycopeptides containing undecasaccharides demonstrated the significant improvement in resolution of HPAE compared to previous chromatographic methods by either reverse-phase or amine-bonded stationary phases. Picomole quantities of underivatized oligosaccharides have been detected by triple-pulse amperometric detection, which produced similar responses for a wide range of structures. Quantification of two triantennary glycopeptides from bovine fetuin by using either detector response or 1H NMR was comparable. The N-glycanase-catalyzed release of two 1----4 and 1----3 positional isomers of an undecasaccharide from a tryptic glycopeptide of bovine fetuin could be observed and quantified by direct injection of the enzyme mixture into the chromatograph.\r"

All of these bind into the same hydrophobic pocket within the viral protein VP1 beta-barrel structure, although the orientation and position of each compound within the pocket was found to differ. The compounds cause the protein shell to be less flexible, thereby inhibiting disassembly. Although the antiviral potency of these compounds varies by 120-fold, they all induce the same conformational changes on the virion. The interactions of these compounds with the viral capsid are consistent with their observed antiviral activities against human rhinovirus 14 drug-resistant mutants and other rhinovirus serotypes. Crystallographic studies of one of these mutants confirm the partial sequencing data and support the finding that this is a single mutation that occurs within the binding pocket.\r"

This induction is due at least in part to an increase in the rate of transcription and does not require protein synthesis. A 40-base-pair DNA sequence within the beta-interferon promoter, termed the interferon gene regulatory element (IRE), is an inducible enhancer in mouse fibroblasts, and both positive and negative regulatory DNA sequences have been identified within this element. In this paper we identify three factors that bind specifically to two positive regulatory domains within the IRE. Two of these factors are present in nuclear extracts prepared from uninduced and induced cells; one is present only in extracts from induced cells. The functional significance of these binding activities was demonstrated by showing that point mutations within the IRE that decrease human beta-interferon gene transcription in vivo prevent binding in vitro. We propose that induction of the beta-interferon gene involves the modification of a protein to a form that binds specifically to a positive regulatory sequence within the IRE.\r"

This important microbicidal system is impaired in inherited disorders known as chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Previously we determined the sequence of the larger subunit from the cDNA of the CGD gene, the X chromosome locus affected in \"X-linked\" CGD. To complete the primary structure of the cytochrome b and to assess expression of the smaller subunit, we isolated cDNA clones for the 22-kDa polypeptide by immunoscreening and confirmed their authenticity by direct N-terminal protein sequencing. Although the deduced amino acid sequence of the 22-kDa subunit is not overtly similar to other known cytochromes, we observed a 31-amino acid stretch of 39% identity with polypeptide I of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase centered on a potential heme-coordinating histidine. Similarities in the hydropathy profiles and spacing of histidines of the 22-kDa protein and myoglobin suggest structural motifs in common with other heme-containing proteins that are not readily revealed by primary amino acid sequences. Although RNA for the larger subunit has been found only in cells of the phagocytic lineage, stable RNA encoding the 22-kDa subunit was observed in all cell types. However, the stable 22-kDa protein was detected only in phagocytic cells that were expressing the larger subunit RNA. This observation suggests that the large subunit may play a role in regulating the assembly of the heterodimeric cytochrome b.\r"

  ".U": "88217893\r", 
  ".W": "During heme deficiency in reticulocyte lysates, the heme-regulated protein synthesis inhibitor, HRI, phosphorylates the alpha subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and thus inhibits protein synthesis. Two factors, eIF-2 and a reticulocyte-lysate supernatant factor that we term RF, reverse this inhibition. We now report the following. (i) An active eIF-2 preparation contained, in addition to the three subunits (alpha, beta, and gamma), a 67-kDa polypeptide. Pretreatment of eIF-2 with polyclonal antibodies against either isolated alpha subunit or 67-kDa polypeptide almost completely inhibited the reversal activity. Upon further fractionation, three-subunit eIF-2 and the 67-kDa polypeptide were resolved. Neither the three-subunit eIF-2 nor the 67-kDa polypeptide alone was active in protein synthesis inhibition reversal. The activity was, however, restored by combining both the three-subunit eIF-2 and the 67-kDa polypeptide. (ii) Active RF preparations contained eIF-2 alpha (unphosphorylated) and beta subunits and the 67-kDa polypeptide. As with eIF-2, prior treatment of the RF preparation with antibodies to either the alpha subunit or the 67-kDa polypeptide almost completely inhibited the reversal activity. The RF preparation devoid of eIF-2 gamma subunit did not form ternary complex (Met-tRNA(fMet).eIF-2.GTP). The eIF-2 gamma subunit in the free form was isolated, and addition of this isolated gamma subunit to RF promoted significant ternary-complex formation. (iii) Purified HRI efficiently phosphorylated the alpha subunit in the three subunit eIF-2. However, the extent of such phosphorylation was significantly reduced when eIF-2 containing the 67-kDa polypeptide was used. The 67-kDa polypeptide apparently protected eIF-2 alpha subunit from HRI-catalyzed phosphorylation but did not inhibit HRI activity. Based on these results, we suggest that the protein synthesis inhibition reversal activity in both eIF-2 and RF is due to the same components--namely, eIF-2 alpha subunit and the 67-kDa polypeptide. The 67-kDa polypeptide protects eIF-2 alpha subunit from HRI-catalyzed phosphorylation and may also be a necessary component of the functioning eIF-2 molecule.\r"

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, and complete amino acid sequence determination of the pure protein reveal that it consists of a single polypeptide chain of 4.3 kDa. Purified ChTX is a potent and selective inhibitor of the approximately 220-pS Ca2+-activated K+ channel present in GH3 anterior pituitary cells and primary bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. The toxin reversibly blocks channel activity by interacting at the external pore of the channel protein with an apparent Kd of 2.1 nM. The primary structure of ChTX is similar to a number of neurotoxins of diverse origin, which suggests that ChTX is a member of a superfamily of proteins that modify ion-channel activities. On the basis of this similarity, the three-dimensional structure of ChTX has been modeled from the known crystal structure of alpha-bungarotoxin. These studies indicate that ChTX is useful as a probe of Ca2+-activated K+-channel function and suggest that the proposed tertiary structure of ChTX may provide insight into the mechanism of channel block.\r"
