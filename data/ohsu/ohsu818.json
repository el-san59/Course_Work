  ".W": "Gout is primarily a disease of middle-aged males and is unusual in females and adolescent males. We describe 21 young men and women (mean age 28 years) referred because of precocious onset of gout or hyperuricaemia. Fifteen patients had a family history, but known hereditary causes of primary or secondary hyperuricaemia were excluded. A high proportion (14/21) also had reduced renal function, but there was no clear relationship between this and the hyperuricaemia. Only two patients were hypertensive. A striking abnormality was that the uric acid clearance relative to creatinine [FEur] was subnormal (mean 4.4 +/- 1.4 per cent) in 15/21 patients, including all seven females. A dominantly inherited defect in renal tubular urate handling, leading to a reduced endogenous urate clearance, is the most likely explanation for the hyperuricaemia in this group. Only six patients, all male had a normal [FEur] (mean 8.6 +/- 1.0 per cent). The results confirm that young men and women with gout-or hyperuricaemia disproportionate to the renal dysfunction-should always be investigated, not only for purine defects, but also for abnormalities of renal urate handling. Since the abnormality described here was found also in symptomless subjects, the families of such patients must also be studied. Early identification is important since treatment may ameliorate the renal damage. Although rare, the number of such patients seen in a single referral unit suggests that this type of renal tubular defect in urate handling is more common than suspected and may only come to attention through an isolated episode of precocious gout, when renal function may already be impaired.\r"

Ten years after diagnosis, 34 patients were known to be dead and 214 alive. A number of factors were significantly associated with survival on univariate analysis and appeared to form two independent intra-related groups: a 'metabolic' group and a 'degenerative condition' group. Multivariate analysis of these two groups showed that glucose tolerance (the rate constant KG for decrease in plasma glucose concentration after its intravenous injection) was significantly related to survival in the 'metabolic' group, and age, blood pressure and anti-hypertensive therapy were significant in the 'degenerative' group of factors. A low KG value was more strongly associated with prognosis than any other factor. Values from the one year review were prognostically more useful than initial or later values. Indices of insulin secretion were similar irrespective of whether patients survived or died, and so we believe the lower KG values of dead patients were due to impaired insulin sensitivity. A regression equation using the above factors correctly allocated survival outcome in 81% of subjects.\r"

In eleven cases the diagnosis was made on clinical grounds, while the diagnosis was confirmed only at post-mortem in two patients. Pleural effusions were present in seven patients, while pulsus paradoxus was found in only one case. Echocardiograms were undertaken in ten patients and all showed evidence of pericardial effusions, which were usually small and sited posteriorly. A delayed ventricular filling pattern indicating abnormal ventricular relaxation was seen in two patients with cardiac tamponade. The surviving 11 patients were reviewed a median of three years after diagnosis of their pericardial disease. Pericardectomy had been performed in six, all of whom were asymptomatic and had a normal chest radiograph. Steroids alone had been given to the other five, and three of these remained dyspnoeic with cardiomegaly. The clinical features distinguishing chronic pericardial disease from other causes of right heart failure in rheumatoid arthritis patients are subtle. As management is fundamentally different, serious consideration should be given to the diagnosis of chronic pericardial disease in any patient with rheumatoid arthritis who presents with right-sided heart failure.\r"

  ".U": "90356715\r", 
  ".W": "Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in 39 consecutive patients with atheromatous renal artery stenosis associated with hypertension. The mean blood pressure before angioplasty was 191/107 mmHg and this had dropped to a mean of 167/90 mmHg at the patient's most recent visit, representing a significant fall in both systolic (p less than 0.01) and diastolic pressures (p less than 0.001). The mean serum creatinine was 166.7 mumol/l before percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and 155.3 mumol/l at the most recent visit (not statistically significant). The mean number of anti-hypertensive drugs fell from 2.4 to 1.9 after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (p less than 0.05). Three patients (eight per cent) were 'cured' (diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg without medication), 25 (64 per cent) had 'improved' (diastolic blood pressure less than 109 mmHg, with a fall of more than 15 per cent) and 11 (28 per cent) had not improved. Logistic discriminant analysis showed that pre-percutaneous transluminal angioplasty diastolic blood pressure, age, serum creatinine and smoking habit together correctly predicted the outcome of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 90 per cent of patients, with four 'false positives' and no 'false negatives'. Ten patients suffered a total of 12 serious complications related to the procedure: one death in acute renal failure, one myocardial infarction, one severe hypotension just after the procedure, one deep vein thrombosis, one episode of transient ischaemia of the toes and seven groin haematomas. Thus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for atheromatous renal artery stenosis rarely 'cures' hypertension, but improved blood pressure control is often achieved, albeit at the expense of troublesome complications. A prospective, randomized trial is needed to establish whether or not the improvement is due directly to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.\r"

Correct diagnosis was made in nine of the 12 patients with stage A and B1 tumors. Overestimation occurred in the other three patients, who had previously undergone radiation therapy or surgery. Local stage was correctly assessed in 11 patients with stage B2 carcinoma and in six patients with stage B3 tumors. Enlarged lymph nodes were detected in four of seven patients with nodes containing carcinoma. In two other patients with enlarged nodes, no carcinoma was identified at histologic examination. MR imaging may enable correct staging of local extent of rectal carcinoma, particularly in patients who have not previously undergone radiation therapy or surgery. However, evaluation of lymph nodes is less accurate.\r"

To determine the frequency and significance of such enlargement, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of 44 hemodynamically stable patients who had experienced recent blunt abdominal trauma. The severity of splenic, hepatic, or other visceral injuries seen on each CT scan was numerically scored, and the amount of intraperitoneal fluid was assessed. Twenty-five patients (57%) had over 10% enlargement (average enlargement, 56%) on follow-up scans. Increasing volume did not correlate with clinical deterioration or the need for splenectomy. It did correlate modestly with the amount of blood in the peritoneum on CT scans, the number of units of blood transfused, and two clinical indexes of systemic trauma. Therefore, an enlarging spleen is not a CT indicator of a deteriorating clinical condition. This phenomenon is most likely due to marked adrenergic stimulation after injury and changing fluid volumes.\r"

Ducts were seen in the right lobe more often than in the left lobe. There was no statistically significant relationship between visualization of IHBDs and patient age.

Deglutition was studied in 75 individuals who had experienced a near-fatal choking episode (NFCE) or sudden inability to breathe during food intake that was promptly relieved by means of a Heimlich maneuver, suctioning, or intubation. Videofluoroscopy supplemented by static imaging revealed abnormal stages of deglutition in 58 individuals: oral, 32; pharyngeal, 19; pharyngoesophageal segment (PES), 28; and esophageal, 23. Forty individuals aspirated a liquid bolus; this was more often due to oral dysfunction (bolus leakage, n = 17; delayed initiation, n = 18) than pharyngeal abnormality (defective closure, n = 13; incomplete transport, n = 9). Oral-stage dysfunction was common in those with neurologic disease, a history of dysphagia, and structural or motor abnormalities of the PES or esophagus. Fourteen patients were able to vocalize during the NFCE, and each demonstrated an abnormality of the PES or esophagus that could obstruct a solid bolus, suggesting that symptoms were not due to airway obstruction. A variety of unsuspected deglutition abnormalities were documented, indicating the usefulness of radiographic evaluation after NFCE.\r"

Thirty-nine patients had abnormalities of both oral and pharyngeal function. Two patients had oral dysfunction only, and five had pharyngeal abnormalities only. Mild swallowing difficulties occurred in 18 patients (39%), moderate dysfunction in 23 (50%), and severe dysfunction in five (11%). Thirty-one patients had pharyngeal stasis, which was symmetric in 25 patients (81%), right-sided in three, and left-sided in three. Asymmetric stasis did not correlate to the site of cerebrovascular disease. Twenty-four episodes of aspiration occurred, half of them with the low-viscosity barium suspension. Thus, video-fluoroscopy can be used to define the location and severity of oropharyngeal abnormalities, which is critical for feeding recommendations. The abnormalities present, however, were not useful in predicting the type of cerebrovascular disease.\r"

The authors hypothesize that aortic isthmus lacerations result from a pinch of the aorta between the spine and the anterior bony thorax (manubrium, clavicle, and first ribs) during chest compression caused by abrupt deceleration. Compression of an articulated, normally moving thoracic skeleton containing a synthetic aorta consistently caused transection of the aorta at the isthmus between the spine and anterior bony structures. Analysis of rotation of the first rib in 10 consecutive patients undergoing computed tomography of the chest demonstrated interposition of the distal aortic arch and isthmus between the vertebrae and anterior bony thorax in each instance. Aortas excised from laboratory dogs were pinched between structures simulating bones to reproduce intimal and medial lesions indistinguishable from lesions associated with naturally occurring traumatic disruptions. Although further studies in cadaveric specimens are necessary to confirm this mechanism of injury, the authors believe that their results support the osseous-pinch mechanism of aortic rupture.\r"

Kinetic models were developed to compare GLU-based oxidative glucose metabolism with FDG-based total glucose metabolism (oxidative plus anaerobic) and to compare ACE-based overall oxidative metabolism with FDG-based total glucose metabolism. GLU-based metabolism generally paralleled FDG-based metabolism, but divergence occurred in certain structures such as the papillary muscles, where FDG-based metabolism was much greater. ACE-based metabolism also generally paralleled FDG-based metabolism, but again, the papillary muscles had relatively greater FDG-based metabolism. These discrepancies between FDG-based metabolism and GLU- or ACE-based metabolism suggest the presence of high levels of anaerobic glycolysis. Thus, the study indicates that anaerobic glycolysis, in addition to occurring in ischemic or \"stunned\" myocardium (as has been shown in recent PET studies), occurs normally in specific cardiac regions, despite the presence of abundant oxygen.\r"

In all six patients with compression by hepatic tumors, stents dilated the IVC and debilitating edema of the lower body disappeared. In the three patients with idiopathic obstruction, stents were placed after repeat dilation of the lesions and Budd-Chiari syndrome did not recur during a follow-up period of 7-10 months. In two of the three, cavograms obtained 8 months after placement showed the channels to be open with minimal intimal thickening. Gianturco expandable metallic stents can correct IVC obstruction due to compression by hepatic tumors and are useful in preventing reocclusion of the IVC after PTA for the treatment of idiopathic obstruction. The authors recommend using tanem stents connected by at least two struts.\r"

The final diagnosis as revealed by autopsy, surgery, or radiologic/clinical follow-up was pancreatic malignancy in 39 patients and benign disease in eight. A correct diagnosis with the aid of biopsy findings was obtained in 44 of the 47 patients (94%). In three patients with carcinoma of the pancreas, the correct diagnosis was not obtained with use of results from the first biopsy. In two of these three patients, simultaneous biopsy of a liver metastasis revealed the presence of a malignant tumor growth. After the biopsy, two patients had a vasovagal reaction, and two experienced mild pain. No case of biopsy-induced pancreatitis occurred, although in one patient a transient rise in the serum amylase level was seen. The present results show that cut biopsy of the pancreas is a useful, reliable, and nontraumatic method in the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.\r"

With use of a \"single-pass\" standardized technique, cytologic sensitivity rates of 84% for the screw-tipped needles and 87% for the Chiba needles were obtained. No statistically significant difference in effectiveness was found between the two needles. While either needle is clearly acceptable for fine-needle aspiration, since the screw-tipped needle costs more than twice as much as the Chiba needle and is slightly more cumbersome to use, the Chiba needle appears to be preferable, at least initially, to the screw-tipped needle.\r"

The embolic materials used were gelatin sponge, polyvinyl alcohol foams, and metallic coils.

First, endoluminal transcatheter radio-frequency electrocoagulation of the cystic duct was performed under fluoroscopic control, which resulted in complete occlusion in all eight patients. Next, the mucosa of the isolated gallbladder was sclerosed with 95% ethanol and 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate in one to four sessions; no analgesics were required. The gallbladder volumes of all patients, estimated by means of ultrasound, were 1.5-22 cm3 (average, less than 10 cm3) after a mean follow-up period of 5 months. One patient died of a cerebrovascular accident 15 months after sclerotherapy. In all surviving patients, the gallbladder fistulas are dry and obliterated. These early clinical data indicate that electrocoagulation permits reliable, safe obliteration of the human cystic duct. The authors believe that sclerotherapy of the isolated gallbladder is feasible without toxic effects but that their treatment needs adjustment to achieve complete ablation of the gallbladder mucosa in a shorter period and in all patients.\r"

Negatively charged, multilamellar liposomes were labeled with technetium-99m and infused into healthy adult dogs. Each dog received 100 mg/m2 of lipid over 10 minutes at 2 mL/min. Liposomes were administered via the common hepatic artery after proximal occlusion of the gastroduodenal artery, via the cranial mesenteric artery, and via the cephalic vein. Distribution (liver, spleen, and lungs) was determined by computer-assisted external imaging techniques. On the average, after arterial infusion, 69.2% of the total activity was located in the liver, 3.6% in the spleen, 3.2% in the lungs, and 3.5% in the general circulation. Following venous injection, 50.7% of the radioactivity was found in the liver, 9.1% in the spleen, 8.6% in the lungs, and 6.7% in the peripheral blood. Once the liposomes entered the systemic circulation, they were cleared at the same rate (half-life beta = 21.5 hours) independent of their route of administration. Increased hepatic liposome uptake should translate into higher local and lower systemic liposomal drug levels.\r"

Variable interval tumor growth was demonstrated in every case except one and ranged from 0 to 1.6 cm/y, with an overall mean linear growth rate of approximately 0.5 cm/y. Ten of 11 \"small renal neoplasms\" (less than or equal to 3.0 cm in diameter) displayed interval growth, with five ultimately measuring greater than 3.0 cm (size range, 3.5-7.0 cm). While the results are preliminary and reflect observations on a very small study sample, it was noted that five of the seven pathologically proved adenocarcinomas appeared homogeneous and well marginated, and all were low-grade, low-stage carcinomas. These grew more slowly and were generally smaller at initial presentation than higher-grade lesions, which demonstrated a more heterogeneous appearance on CT scans.\r"

The MR imaging signal features improved lesion characterization in 47% (eight of 17) of cases, including two of four mature cystic teratomas of the ovary, three uterine fibroids, one solid ovarian tumor, one endometrioma, and a distended urinary bladder that had been mistaken for an ovarian cystic mass. Both MR imaging and sonography were accurate for the characterization of three ovarian cystadenomas and two simple ovarian cysts. On both MR images and sonograms, two simple ovarian cysts were incorrectly diagnosed as complex cystic masses and one teratoma was incorrectly diagnosed as a simple cyst. The origin of the pelvic mass (13 in the ovary, three in the uterus, and one distended urinary bladder) was accurately determined on 100% (17 of 17) of the MR images versus 71% (12 of 17) of the sonograms. In three cases, the results of MR imaging led to cancellation of surgery, which would have proceeded on the basis of the sonographic results alone. MR imaging is a valuable complement to sonography for preoperative evaluation of pelvic masses in pregnant patients.\r"

The following water-soluble agents were used: iothalamate meglumine 30% (n = 3), iothalamate meglumine 60% (n = 3), and ioxilan (n = 4). The agents were injected through catheters placed in the fallopian tubes. Fallopian tubes and peritoneal cavities were histologically evaluated. The contralateral tube served as a control. Ioxilan and iothalamate meglumine 30% produced no pathologic response in the tube or peritoneal cavity. Iothalamate meglumine 60% was associated with mild inflammatory infiltrate, mucosal edema, giant cell reaction, and periovarian adhesions that were bilateral but more pronounced on the injected side. Use of ethiodized oil resulted in papillary fibrous adhesions on the ovarian surface, and fat granulomas were seen in the periovarian tissues. The safety of oil-based contrast agents for use in hysterosalpingography is therefore questioned. No significant differences were found among the water-soluble contrast agents.\r"

Seven patients had consolidation of the entire lobe, and five patients had segmental consolidation. After contrast material was administered intravenously, the consolidated lung typically appeared on the scan as an area of homogeneous low attenuation, within which were enhanced branching pulmonary vessels (the CT angiogram sign). To evaluate the specificity of this sign in the discrimination of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, CT scans of 26 patients who had lobar consolidation from other diseases were randomly mixed with the CT scans of 11 patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma. Two independent observers who were unfamiliar with the cases classified 10 and nine of the 11 patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, respectively, as positive for bronchioloalveolar carcinoma by applying the CT angiogram sign, and classified as negative 25 and 23 of the 26 patients without bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, respectively, for an overall specificity of 92.3%. The angiogram sign appeared on the CT scan because of the low-attenuating consolidation, which was caused by the production of mucin or other fluid and the intact bronchovascular framework within the tumor.\r"

Honeycombing was seen in seven patients (30%), while parenchymal bands were seen in six patients (26%). Chest radiographs, on the other hand, showed definite interstitial opacification patterns in only nine patients (39%); six patients (26%) had equivocal reticular areas of attenuation, while eight patients (35%) had normal chest radiographs. Thus, HRCT is much more sensitive than chest radiography when assessing minimal interstitial lung involvement in patients with PSS.\r"

Normal pulmonary arteries and veins were characterized by distinctive signal intensity and diameter variations as well as motion of the vessels during the cardiac cycle. Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension demonstrated loss of the normal pulsatile systolic increase and diastolic decline in velocity-related signal intensity and in diameter of the proximal pulmonary arteries. Disorders of pulmonary venous signal and diameter profiles during the cardiac cycle, which show a characteristic biphasic pattern in healthy subjects, were identified in five patients with mitral valvular disease. These initial results indicate that cine MR imaging techniques hold promise in the evaluation of pathophysiologic conditions in the pulmonary circulation.\r"

Nine abnormalities were selected for analysis: costophrenic angle blunting, interstitial disease, atelectasis, pneumothorax, parenchymal mass, consolidation, obstructive disease, hilar/mediastinal mass, and apical scarring. Six experienced general radiologists participated in the evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for each abnormality and display format. The results indicate that, while the three display formats are equivalent for the detection of some abnormalities, detectable differences in observer performance may be seen even at 2,048 X 2,048 X 12 bits for the detection of obstructive disease, pneumothorax, interstitial disease, and parenchymal masses.\r"

These substances include air, desiccated secretion, mycetomas, acute hemorrhage, calcium, bone, and enamel. When they are surrounded by material that has long T1 and T2 relaxation times, a not uncommon MR appearance in the sinonasal cavities, they may be impossible to differentiate from one another. The current explanations for the low signal intensities are presented, the similarities in the MR appearance are illustrated, and the use of CT to resolve diagnostic problems is discussed.

More than 100 patients with glioma, radiation necrosis, Alzheimer disease, or epilepsy have been studied with this system. Approximately 1 million events are acquired in 15 minutes, starting 1 hour after injection of 10 mCi (370 MBq) of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose. Normal structures as small as the superior colliculi and the external capsule have been resolved. Improved separation of the cortical ribbon from adjacent white matter has allowed more accurate determination of cortical metabolic rate. In two of 15 patients undergoing evaluation for recurrent glioma, the PET 600 images showed tumor uptake that was not apparent on a lower-resolution study. A high-activity orbiting transmission source with electronic collimation allows accurate, short-duration transmission measurements to be made after radiopharmaceutical administration. The anatomic detail seen on the transmission images can be used for reproducible patient positioning with an accuracy of 1-2 mm perpendicular to the image plane. These findings demonstrate the practicality and clinical effectiveness of high-resolution positron emission tomography.\r"

The metabolite maps showed variations in metabolite concentrations across the tumor. In one patient, it was observed that choline concentration was increased in one part of the tumor but decreased in another part. In another patient, the concentration of N-acetyl aspartate was extremely low in one part of the tumor but only slightly increased in another part of the tumor. Lactate was observed in all patients. In one patient, a combined measurement made with positron emission tomography (PET) and MR spectroscopic imaging was performed. This demonstrated that increased lactate concentration measured with H-1 MR spectroscopic imaging corresponded topographically with increased glucose uptake measured with fluorine-18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET. Combined MR spectroscopic and PET measurements provide an opportunity to investigate, in greater detail than before, glucose uptake and catabolism by intracranial tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Although computed tomography (CT) remains the most frequently used imaging examination in acute cerebral infarction, its sensitivity for early detection of strokes remains limited. In middle cerebral artery (MCA) strokes less than 6 hours old, loss of definition of the gray-white interface in the lateral margins of the insula (\"insular ribbon\") was observed. The acute and subacute CT findings in 11 retrospective and 16 prospective patients are presented. Loss of the insular ribbon was detected in 12 of the prospective cases and in all 11 retrospective cases. The insular ribbon is supplied by the insular segment of the MCA and its claustral branches. With cessation of MCA flow, the insular ribbon becomes the region most distal from the anterior and posterior cerebral collateral circulations. Consequently, the insular ribbon effectively becomes a watershed arterial zone. Loss of the insular ribbon is thus a reflection of acute edema due to infarction. Loss of the insular ribbon appears to be another frequent and reliable finding in acute MCA stroke.\r"

  ".U": "90356788\r", 
  ".W": "The most serious and frequent complication of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is intracranial hemorrhage. Identification of patients at greatest risk for intracranial bleeding would be beneficial. Detailed analysis of vascular architecture was performed in 65 patients with intracranial AVMs to identify the vascular characteristics that correlated with hemorrhage. Fifteen characteristics were assessed. Hemorrhage was present in 45 patients (69%). The following characteristics correlated positively with hemorrhage (Fisher-Irwin exact test): central venous drainage (P less than .0001), periventricular or intraventricular location of the AVM (P = .0002), and intranidal aneurysm (P = .028). The following characteristics correlated negatively with hemorrhage: angiomatous change (P = .0005), peripheral venous drainage (P = .005), and mixed venous drainage (P = .021). Multivariate linear discriminant analysis demonstrated that central venous drainage, angiomatous change (negatively predictive), intranidal aneurysm, and periventricular or intraventricular location of the AVM were the most discriminating or predictive characteristics of hemorrhage. Detailed analysis of the vascular architecture of intracranial AVMs helped identify features that strongly correlate with clinical hemorrhage and have important prognostic implications for the treatment of patients with these lesions.\r"

Brain scans demonstrated focal defects in 11 subjects, including seven who were asymptomatic, and no abnormality in one.

No perfusion deficits were seen on I-123 SPECT images in five healthy volunteers. Focal alterations in cerebral perfusion are seen commonly in asymptomatic drug users, and these focal deficits are readily depicted by I-123 IMP SPECT.\r"

System performance was evaluated with phantom measurements and evoked-response studies. A spatial resolution of a few millimeters and a temporal resolution of a millisecond were obtained. First results in patients with partial epilepsy and investigations of the cardiac conductive pathway indicate that biomagnetism is now ready for a systematic clinical evaluation. Interpretation of measurements was facilitated by highlighting biomagnetically localized electrical activity in three-dimensional digital magnetic resonance images.\r"

The authors prospectively evaluated the role of intravenously administered gadopentetate dimeglumine in distinguishing between these two conditions. Fourteen patients with classic rheumatoid arthritis were examined first by a rheumatologist and then by means of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with T1- and T2-weighted sequences. T1-weighted images were also obtained following the intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. T1-weighted images obtained prior to contrast material administration demonstrated an identical low-intensity signal from both effusion and inflamed synovium, and T2-weighted images demonstrated increased signal intensity in both cases. Intravenous administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine allowed distinction between effusion and abnormal synovium, with the effusion remaining of low signal intensity and the synovium demonstrating enhancement and increased signal intensity. The authors conclude that the use of gadopentetate allows distinction between synovial thickening and joint effusion in the knee, which may affect treatment decisions.\r"

Striking voxel-voxel variability in parameters derived with P-31 spectroscopy was found in tumors, with less marked variability seen in normal legs. In the rodent tumors, spatial variations also were found in pH and PO2 measured by means of microelectrodes. These data are consistent with the results of regional measurements in tumors by means of other methods and suggest that clinical MR spectroscopic studies of tumors may need to consider the variability within malignant lesions.\r"

The relationship of the plaque to the tumor was well defined in all cases, including two tumors anterior to the ora serrata. MR imaging measurements of the plaques were within 1 mm of the actual plaque sizes, while tumor measurements were within 2 mm of the preoperative ultrasound estimations of tumor dimensions. Tumors as small as 3 mm thick were readily visualized with MR imaging. Associated subretinal effusion was demonstrated in seven cases.\r"

Most patients received radiation therapy to the whole brain with or without a boost. Chemotherapy was administered to six patients (18%) as part of their initial therapy. The 1- and 2- year rates of progression-free survival were 46% and 27%. The following factors had a favorable impact on survival: age of 60 years or less, normal or mildly impaired preirradiation neurologic function, and confinement of the tumor to the cerebral hemispheres or cerebellum. Chemotherapy as part of initial therapy appears to improve local control. Increasing radiation doses delayed local failure. Failure occurred in the brain (88%), in the eye (23%), and systemically (8%). There were no neuraxis failures identified. The authors conclude that primary CNS lymphoma is a locally aggressive disease that is poorly controlled with conventional radiation therapy. Investigation for more effective therapy is ongoing.\r"

Interpolated planar raw data were obtained retrospectively from any level within the volume, and these afforded high-quality images that were comparable to standard images.

The H-exchange rate of residues in three discontiguous regions of the cyt c polypeptide backbone was slowed by factors up to 340-fold in the antibody-antigen complex compared with free cyt c. The protected residues, 36 to 38, 59, 60, 64 to 67, 100, and 101, and their hydrogen-bond acceptors, are brought together in the three-dimensional structure to form a contiguous, largely exposed protein surface with an area of about 750 square angstroms. The interaction site determined in this way is consistent with prior epitope mapping studies and includes several residues that were not previously identified. The hydrogen exchange labeling approach can be used to map binding sites on small proteins in antibody-antigen complexes and may be applicable to protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions in general.\r"

A peptide model for the basic region of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 has been developed in which the leucine zipper has been replaced by a disulfide bond. The 34-residue peptide dimer, but not the reduced monomer, binds DNA with nanomolar affinity at 4 degrees C. DNA binding is sequence-specific as judged by deoxyribonuclease I footprinting. Circular dichroism spectroscopy suggests that the peptide adopts a helical structure when bound to DNA. These results demonstrate directly that the GCN4 basic region is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding and suggest that a major function of the GCN4 leucine zipper is simply to mediate protein dimerization. Our approach provides a strategy for the design of short sequence-specific DNA binding peptides.\r"

The basic regions are predicted to be disordered in the absence of DNA and to form alpha helices when bound to DNA. These helices bind in the major groove forming multiple hydrogen-bonded and van der Waals contacts with the nucleotide bases. To test this model, two peptides were designed that were identical to natural leucine zipper proteins only at positions hypothesized to be critical for dimerization and DNA recognition. The peptides form dimers that bind specifically to DNA with their basic regions in alpha-helical conformations.\r"

  ".W": "The major small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) U1, U2, U4 + U6, and U5 have to be transported from the cytoplasm, where they are synthesized, to the nucleus, where they splice pre-messenger RNAs. Since the free core snRNP proteins in the cytoplasm do not enter the nucleus on their own, the nuclear location signal must either reside on the snRNA or be created as a result of snRNA-protein interaction. Here the involvement by the 5'-terminal cap of snRNA molecules in the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of UsnRNPs has been studied by microinjection of synthetic U1 RNA molecules into frog oocytes; the U1 RNA bore either the normal cap (m3G) or a chemical derivative. Antibodies in the cytoplasm against the m3G cap inhibited the nuclear uptake of U1 snRNP. U1 RNA that was uncapped or contained an unnatural ApppG cap did not enter the nucleus, even though it carried a normal complement of protein molecules. When the ribose ring of the m3G cap was oxidized with periodate, nuclear transport of U1 snRNPs was severely inhibited. Finally, microinjection of m3G cap alone (but not m7G cap) into oocytes severely inhibited the transport of U1 snRNPs to the nucleus. These data suggest that one step in the nuclear uptake of U1 snRNPs involves the m3G cap structure.\r"

With the use of transgenic technology, two lines of mice were created that express the human apolipoprotein CIII gene. One of these mouse lines with 100 copies of the gene was found to express large amounts of the protein and to be severely hypertriglyceridemic. The other mouse line with one to two copies of the gene expressed low amounts of the protein, but nevertheless manifested mild hypertriglyceridemia. Thus, overexpression of apolipoprotein CIII can be a primary cause of hypertriglyceridemia in vivo and may provide one possible etiology for this common disorder in humans.\r"

Forty-one percent of male and 32% of female cadavers were infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Fifteen percent of adult male and 13% of adult female annual deaths are due to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). In Abidjan, AIDS is the leading cause of death and years of potential life lost in adult men, followed by unintentional injuries and tuberculosis. In women, AIDS is the second leading cause of death and premature mortality, after deaths related to pregnancy and abortion.

In order to make these changes more accessible for experimental analysis, dissociated cell culture and low-light-level video microscopy were used to examine Aplysia sensory neurons in the presence or absence of their target cells. Repeated applications of serotonin, a facilitating transmitter important in behavioral dishabituation and sensitization, produced growth of the sensory neurons that paralleled the long-term enhancement of synaptic strength. This growth required the presence of the postsynaptic motor neuron. Thus, both the structural changes and the synaptic facilitation of Aplysia sensorimotor synapses accompanying long-term behavioral sensitization can be produced in vitro by applying a single facilitating transmitter repeatedly. These structural changes depend on an interaction of the presynaptic neuron with an appropriate postsynaptic target.\r"

In the hippocampus, both glutamatergic and muscarinic cholinergic stimulation increase phosphoinositide turnover, but with distinct localizations. Cholinergic stimulation affects CA1, CA3, CA4, and subiculum, whereas glutamatergic effects are restricted to the subiculum and CA3. Imaging phosphoinositide turnover in brain slices, which are amenable to electrophysiologic studies, will permit a dynamic localized analysis of regulation of this second messenger in response to synaptic stimulation of specific neuronal pathways.\r"

Angiographic findings of 49 patients were classified into proximal, middle, and distal basilar artery occlusions. Twenty-two of these patients had additional vertebral artery lesions. A fourth group was composed of 36 patients with bilateral distal vertebral artery occlusion without opacification of the basilar artery through a vertebral artery injection. Onset was sudden in 20 patients; sudden, but preceded by prodromal symptoms in 11 patients; and progressive in 54 patients. Patients with progressive strokes often had bilateral vertebral artery occlusions. Most patients with acute onset had occlusion of the middle and distal basilar artery. An embolic origin of basilar artery occlusion from an arteriosclerotic vertebral artery lesion was assumed to be an important mechanism. An embolus reaching the basilar artery may not necessarily reach the top of the artery, but may also become lodged more proximally.\r"

Using magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate lesion severity, we determined that demented patients had more severe lesions than nondemented patients; this difference was especially prominent for lesions in the frontal lobe (p less than 0.001). Score on the dementia rating scale of Hasegawa et al was negatively correlated with severity of the lesions in the frontal lobe. Blood pressure was positively correlated with the severity of white matter lesions. We show that severity of lesions in the white matter, especially in the frontal lobe, is correlated with mental deterioration of patients with multiple lacunar infarcts. Because uncontrolled hypertension is related to the severity of such lesions, careful selection of antihypertensive treatment is important in preventing both the cerebral lesions and the associated mental deterioration.\r"

Computed tomography excluded other relevant pathology. Two observers assessed the initial regional cerebral blood flow deficit using a semiquantitative visual method. The size of the initial flow deficit correlated negatively with the Barthel Index score (performance of the activities of daily living) after 6 months but not with the motricity index score (a measure of severity of the hemiparesis) after 6 months. The initial flow deficit was strongly correlated with early death from tentorial herniation; all five patients with the largest initial flow deficits died less than or equal to 6 days after the stroke, but among the 21 patients with smaller initial flow deficits only one died early (p = 0.00018, Fisher's exact two-tailed test). Although depressed level of consciousness, conjugate gaze deviation, and severe hemiparesis were more prevalent in the group of six patients who died early, the differences in prevalence between this group and the 20 patients who survived were not significant. Single-photon emission computed tomography is a relatively simple method to semiquantitatively measure a blood flow disturbance immediately after its occurrence. The magnitude of this blood flow disturbance is strongly related to early death from tentorial herniation. Because of these properties, single-photon emission computed tomography to measure regional cerebral blood flow can be of great use in acute stroke research.\r"

We describe our own method, applied in previous studies, in which the amounts of blood in 10 basal cisterns and fissures and in four ventricles are graded separately. In grading single computed tomograms of 182 consecutive patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, the agreement between pairs of three observers, studied with kappa statistics, was relatively good for individual cisterns or fissures (kappa between 0.35 and 0.65) and ventricles (kappa between 0.47 and 0.74). The Spearman rank correlation coefficients for the sum of the scores for subarachnoid and intraventricular blood were very high. Summed scores for extravasated blood are suitable as a baseline variable in follow-up studies of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.\r"

At 70%, trifluoromethane sensitized the cats' hearts to epinephrine, but to a much lesser degree than 40% chlorodifluoromethane, and produced only moderate changes in cerebral electrical activity as measured by the electroencephalogram.

Our model consisted of ventricular fibrillation (no blood flow) lasting 12.5 minutes, controlled reperfusion with cardiopulmonary bypass and defibrillation within 5 minutes, controlled intermittent positive-pressure ventilation to 20 hours, and intensive care to 96 hours. Group I (control, n = 6) dogs were reperfused under conditions of normotension (mean arterial blood pressure 100 mm Hg) and normal hematocrit (greater than or equal to 35%). Group II (n = 6) and III (n = 6) dogs were treated with norepinephrine at the beginning of reperfusion to induce hypertension for 4 hours. In addition, group III dogs received hypervolemic hemodilution to a hematocrit of 20% using dextran 40. There were no differences in the time to recovery of electroencephalographic activity among groups. All six group I dogs remained severely disabled; in groups II and III combined, six of the 12 dogs achieved good outcome (p less than 0.01). Some regional histopathologic damage scores at 96 hours were better in groups II and/or III than in group I (neocortex: p less than 0.05 group II different from group I; hippocampus: p less than 0.01 both groups II and III different from group I). Total histopathologic damage scores were similar among the groups. A hypertensive bout with a peak mean arterial blood pressure of greater than or equal to 200 mm Hg beginning 1-5 minutes after the start of reperfusion was correlated with good outcome (p less than 0.01). Our results support the use of an initial bout of severe hypertension, but not the use of delayed hemodilution.\r"

  ".W": "Blood-brain barrier integrity during cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be important because of the potential effects of adrenergic agonists administered during arrest on cerebral metabolism and the cerebral vasculature. As an index of blood-brain barrier permeability to small molecules, we measured the brain uptake of [14C]alpha-aminoisobutyric acid during a 10-minute period in 25 anesthetized dogs. To correct for the amount of carbon-14 label in the plasma space, we administered [3H] inulin 2 minutes before death. The mean transfer coefficient in 14 brain regions of five control dogs ranged from 0.002 to 0.007 ml/g/min. After 8 (n = 15) or 15 (n = 5) minutes of cardiac arrest, external chest compression was instituted to maintain aortic blood pressure above 60 mm Hg. The transfer coefficient was not elevated during chest compression (n = 10), immediately following defibrillation (n = 5), or 4 hours after resuscitation (n = 5); in some brain regions the transfer coefficient decreased. However, the decrease in the transfer coefficient was proportional to the decrease in the cerebral plasma volume as measured by the ratio of the [3H]inulin concentration in the tissue to that in the plasma. Thus, it is unlikely that a decrease in capillary surface area masked an increase in blood-brain barrier permeability. Therefore, we found no evidence of blood-brain barrier disruption during or after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in dogs. Despite the large phasic increases in sagittal sinus pressure associated with external chest compression, concurrent increases in cerebrospinal fluid pressure apparently protect the microcirculation from increased transmural pressure.\r"

We wanted to assess further whether special risks such as exacerbation of extracellular acidification reflecting progressive exhaustion of the capacity to buffer H+ in the extracellular space are associated with repeated short ischemic insults. We monitored spontaneous electrical activity, extracellular direct-current potential, extracellular H+ activity, and tissue PCO2 in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to four cycles of 3-minute ischemia produced by four-vessel occlusion with 27-minute reperfusion after each insult. Except for electrical activity, which failed to recover fully from the first ischemic insult, all parameters returned to a level close to normal after each reperfusion. Changes during ischemia did not evolve with repetition of the insult. Electrical silence occurred within approximately 20 seconds after the onset of each ischemic episode and always preceded the steep drop of direct-current potential, indicating ischemic depolarization. Each four-vessel occlusion immediately initiated a steep rise of tissue PCO2 and extracellular H+ activity, with extracellular H+ activity reaching a maximum within approximately 145 seconds. Changes in extracellular H+ activity during each recirculation period consistently included an additional and short-lasting increase associated with repolarization, a rapid decrease closely related to that of tissue PCO2, and a slow progressive return to normal. These results suggest that short, repetitive ischemic episodes severe enough to produce cell membrane depolarization and maximum acidosis of the neuronal microenvironment do not have a deleterious cumulative effect on the studied parameters, in particular, on interstitial acidosis.\r"

Since the rate of edema formation during the early stages of ischemia is related to the rate of sodium transport from blood to brain, this study was designed to determine whether steroids reduce ischemic edema formation by inhibiting blood-brain barrier sodium transport. Dexamethasone was compared with progesterone since the latter is a more potent inhibitor of sodium transport in isolated capillaries. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle (n = 22) or 2 mg/kg of either dexamethasone (n = 22) or progesterone (n = 17) 1 hour before occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. After 4 hours of ischemia, brain water content and blood-brain barrier permeability to [3H] alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and sodium-22 were determined. In controls, mean +/- SEM water content of tissue in the center of the ischemic zone was 82.4 +/- 0.2%. Brain edema was significantly reduced following pretreatment with either dexamethasone (80.6 +/- 0.1%, p less than 0.001) or progesterone (81.5 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.05). There was also a significant reduction in blood-brain barrier permeability to alpha-aminoisobutyric acid in normal brain following either treatment (e.g., 2.21 +/- 0.19 and 1.37 +/- 0.10 microliters/g/min, p less than 0.001, for control and dexamethasone treatments, respectively), but no effect on the permeability to sodium (e.g., 1.19 +/- 0.05 and 1.12 +/- 0.11 microliters/g/min for control and dexamethasone treatments, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "A coiled stainless steel wire clip was made that allowed us to chronically reduce cerebral blood flow in Mongolian gerbils. After 6 weeks of reduced cerebral blood flow in 15 experimental gerbils, we evaluated their learning ability and found it to be impaired relative to that in 15 control gerbils. Eight weeks after surgery, regional cerebral blood flow in the parietal cortex measured by the hydrogen clearance method in the experimental gerbils was 73-76% of that in the control gerbils. Light microscopy showed minimal histologic changes in the brains of the experimental gerbils. Concentrations of brain proteins analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that among water-soluble brain proteins, the concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins (microtubule-associated protein 2, calspectin, and clathrin) declined in the experimental gerbils. In particular, the concentration of microtubule-associated protein 2 declined significantly. Our findings show that the reduction of cerebral blood flow via carotid stenosis impairs the learning behavior in gerbils, with an associated decrease in the concentration of microtubule-associated protein 2. We believe that Mongolian gerbils with chronically reduced cerebral blood flow are a useful animal model of chronic brain hypoperfusion.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to isolate and characterize the emission of acoustic signals from saccular aneurysms, we made a series of invasive microphone recordings from experimental aneurysms created on the common carotid arteries of dogs using the vein pouch technique. Using a modified probe microphone, we compared recordings from the common carotid artery before creation of the aneurysm to recordings from the aneurysmal surface, both before and after clip occlusion. We then performed spectral analysis, band-pass filtering, and spectrographic analysis to compare the dominant frequency and width of the frequency range of both the aneurysmal and carotid recorded signals. The aneurysmal signals had a significantly higher dominant frequency (p less than or equal to 0.05) and a significantly wider frequency range (p less than or equal to 0.05) than the carotid signals. Aneurysmal signals recorded under conditions of systemic hypotension had a significantly lower frequency (p less than or equal to 0.05) than aneurysmal signals recorded under conditions of hypertension. Our results support the assumptions that acoustic signals from experimental saccular aneurysms are distinct from those of the parent vessel and that the aneurysmal signal can be characterized using passive microphone recordings.\r"

In one patient, cerebral venous thrombosis was the initial manifestation of lupus; in the five others, it occurred 1-33 years after the diagnosis of lupus. The main clinical features of cerebral venous thrombosis were persistent headache in all six patients, focal symptoms in four, and seizures in three; papilledema was present in only one patient. Cerebral venous thrombosis was diagnosed based on angiography or magnetic resonance imaging. Both the transverse (in five patients) and the superior sagittal (in three) sinuses were involved. Extracranial arterial and/or venous thrombosis were present in three patients, abortion in two, thrombocytopenia in four, and lupus anticoagulant in three. The neurologic symptoms resolved rapidly in five patients treated with steroids and heparin. Cerebral venous thrombosis should be suspected in patients with lupus who complain of persistent headache, especially in the presence of neurologic symptoms.\r"
