  ".W": "The use of simple relaxation-based stress management procedures in the treatment of mild primary hypertension has been the subject of extensive study. Stress management appears to lead to reliably greater reductions in pressure than a variety of control procedures. The mechanisms underlying these effects are obscure, and research has not identified which patients will benefit most from treatment. Preliminary data suggest that stress management may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, but much research must be done if this is to be confirmed. It is suggested that such research should take into account the possibility that stress management may have beneficial effects on more than just hypertension-related aspects of the cardiovascular disease process.\r"

These may include nonpharmacological methods, such as the various forms of behavioral therapy (e.g., meditation, relaxation, and biofeedback techniques); weight reduction and avoidance of particular foods and agents that stimulate sympathetic activity (including caffeine and alcohol), and regular physical exercise. Pharmacological therapy includes centrally acting drugs such as alpha-methyldopa, clonidine, and reserpine; ganglionic blockers such as hexamethonium; agents acting on sympathetic nerve terminals such as guanethidine and debrisoquine; and drugs that may act at multiple sites, such as the beta-adrenergic blockers. The role of reducing sympathetic activity in the current management of hypertension and its complications is considered in this overview.\r"

First, in regard to modulation of vascular changes, atherosclerosis appears to progress more slowly during hypotension than during normotension. This finding may have implications for the optimal level of blood pressure. Second, structural \"remodeling\" of the vessel wall occurs in both atherosclerosis and hypertension. Remodeling helps to preserve the arterial lumen despite intimal proliferation in atherosclerosis. In contrast, remodeling (which differs from vascular hypertrophy) reduces the vascular lumen in chronic hypertension. Third, functional changes impair active vasodilator responses in both atherosclerotic and hypertensive vessels, in part by endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Finally, we propose that leukocytes as well as platelets may be important cellular mediators of spasm in atherosclerotic arteries.\r"

  ".W": "Current knowledge of the links between the sympathetic nervous system and vascular damage in hypertension and atherosclerosis is summarized. The main mechanisms leading to the structural changes of the arterial wall as a consequence of enhanced adrenergic drive are reported. Hemodynamic mechanisms, including increase in pressure leading to changes in the arterioles and alteration of flow pattern with impact mainly in the large arteries, respectively, account for the typical target organ damage observed in hypertension and is involved in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Regarding the direct effect of catecholamines, the atherogenic effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine in the absence of changes in blood pressure and cholesterol levels have been demonstrated in vivo in monkeys and rabbits. In rats, catecholamine administration induces polyploidization of aortic smooth muscle cells in vivo and in vitro. Regarding the effects of lipid metabolism, adrenergic stimulation may induce free fatty acid transformation into triglycerides with secondary increase in very low density lipoprotein plasma levels and decrease of very low density lipoprotein transformation into high density lipoprotein through circulating lipoprotein lipase inhibition. Catecholamines may also increase cholesterol levels of the arterial wall, probably by triggering the acyl-cholesterol-acyl-transferase activity. Finally, indirect evidence of the pathogenetic role played by the sympathetic system in the development of vascular disease derives from the results of experiments showing that sympatholytic agents are capable of reducing both medial hypertrophy and atherogenesis. beta-Blockers, alpha- and beta-blockers, and centrally acting sympatholytic agents not only ameliorate hemodynamics but also appear to inhibit the direct effects of catecholamines on the arterial wall.\r"

  ".W": "In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, the efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin were compared with those of unfractionated sodium heparin (standard heparin) in 136 patients who had elective total hip replacement. The patients received subcutaneous injection of either 5000 international units of low-molecular-weight heparin once daily or 5000 international units of standard heparin three times a day. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin began twelve hours before the operation, and treatment with standard heparin began two hours preoperatively; both regimens were continued for ten days. Twelve days postoperatively, bilateral ascending phlebography was performed in 122 patients, sixty-three in the treatment group that received low-molecular-weight heparin and fifty-nine in the treatment group that received standard heparin. Pulmonary scintigraphy was performed in 127 patients. Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in forty-four patients: nineteen (30 per cent) of the sixty-three who received low-molecular-weight heparin and twenty-five (42 per cent) of the fifty-nine who received standard heparin. All but four patients, two from each treatment group, were asymptomatic. The difference in the total rate of thrombosis in the two groups was not significant (p = 0.189). However, thrombosis occurred in the thigh in only six (10 per cent) of the patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin but in eighteen (31 per cent) of those who received standard heparin, a significant difference (p = 0.011). Pulmonary embolism was detected in twenty-seven patients: eight (12.3 per cent) of those who received low-molecular-weight heparin and nineteen (30.6 per cent) of those who received standard heparin. Only three patients had clinical signs of embolism. Pulmonary embolism was significantly more frequent in the group that received standard heparin (p = 0.016). Total loss of blood and the total amount of blood that was transfused were significantly reduced in the patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin compared with those who received standard heparin. Prophylaxis was not discontinued because of hemorrhage in any patient. The efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin was superior to that of standard heparin in the prevention of femoral thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, although the over-all incidence of deep-vein thrombosis was not statistically different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized, prospective trial, a low-molecular-weight heparinoid (Org 10172 [Lomoparan]) was compared with warfarin for efficacy and safety in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in 263 patients who had an operatively treated fracture of the hip. One group of patients received Org 10172 in a dose of 750 units subcutaneously every twelve hours until the ninth postoperative day; on the seventh postoperative day, warfarin was added to the regimen. The other group received only warfarin. Both drugs were begun preoperatively, immediately after the admission evaluation. In the patients who received warfarin, the desired prothrombin time was one and one-half times the control level. Deep-vein thrombosis was detected by 125I-fibrinogen scanning and impedance plethysmography and was confirmed by phlebography and compression ultrasonography. Deep-vein thrombosis was found in nine (7 per cent) of the 132 patients who received Org 10172 and in twenty-eight (21 per cent) of the 131 patients who received warfarin (p less than 0.001). Adverse reactions were not significantly different in the two groups. Major bleeding complications occurred in eight patients in the Org-10172 group, only four of whom were receiving the drug at the time of bleeding, and in five patients who were receiving warfarin (not significant). There was no difference in intraoperative loss of blood or in requirements for transfusion. We concluded that the low-molecular-weight heparinoid Org 10172 is a safe, convenient, effective antithrombotic agent for the prevention of venous thrombosis after an operation for fracture of the hip.\r"

However, the effect of epidural anesthesia on the rate of thrombosis after total knee arthroplasty has not been reported previously, to our knowledge. A review was conducted of 705 total knee arthroplasties (541 patients) that had been performed by a single surgeon between September 1984 and December 1988. During this period, the operative technique, the protocol for rehabilitation, and the regimen for prophylaxis against thromboembolism did not change meaningfully. The patients received either epidural or general anesthesia. Preoperative and postoperative perfusion scans of the lungs and a venogram of the lower limb or limbs that had been operated on were done for all patients. For the 227 patients who had received epidural anesthesia, the over-all rate of deep-vein thrombosis was 48 per cent, which was significantly lower than the 64 per cent incidence in the 264 patients who had received general anesthesia (p less than 0.0001). The greatest reduction was in the occurrence of proximal thrombosis, which was identified in 9 per cent of the patients who had had general anesthesia but in only 4 per cent of those who had had epidural anesthesia (p less than 0.05). The use of epidural anesthesia reduced the incidence of proximal thrombosis after both unilateral and one-stage bilateral arthroplasty.\r"

All patients began walking by the third postoperative day. One hundred and ninety-six patients who had 217 total hip arthroplasties were included. Twenty-eight per cent of the procedures were revisions of a previous total hip replacement or of an endoprosthesis, and the remainder were primary arthroplasties. Patients were randomized as to the type of prophylaxis that they received: intermittent pneumatic compression alone, seventy-six hips; intermittent pneumatic compression and aspirin, seventy-two hips; or intermittent pneumatic compression and low-dose warfarin, sixty-nine hips. Before discharge from the hospital, and at an average of seven days after the operation, all patients were evaluated for the presence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis with either venography on the side of the operation or with bilateral venous ultrasonography. The relative frequency with which thrombosis occurred in a proximal vein was not significantly different in the three groups; the over-all relative frequency was 10 per cent. Intermittent compression during and after the operation effectively reduces the rate of proximal-vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. With the number of patients in our study, the effectiveness of this technique could not be shown to be augmented by oral administration of either aspirin or low-dose warfarin.\r"

Each segment contained four motion segments, including the lumbosacral junction. Isthmic spondylolisthesis was created by sectioning the pars interarticularis of the sixth lumbar vertebra and all posterior ligaments between the fifth and sixth lumbar levels. Eight constructs were tested sequentially: (1) the intact spine, (2) the destabilized spine, (3) the spine fixed with Harrington double-distraction rods, (4) the spine treated with transpedicular Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation with a transverse approximating device, (5) the spine treated with Steffee transpedicular screws and plates, (6) the spine treated with posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis, (7) the spine treated with Cotrel-Dubousset instrumentation and posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis, and (8) the spine treated with Steffee instrumentation and posterior lumbar interbody arthrodesis. One motion segment was involved in each construct, except for the spine that was fixed with Harrington instrumentation, which involved three segments. Strain across the supraspinous and anterior longitudinal ligaments was measured with two extensometers that were attached at the spondylolisthetic level and at the intact motion segments adjacent to the fixed level. Harrington instrumentation was the least rigid construct under any type of loading except axial compression (p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In seven dogs (the control group), a biodegradable polymer spacer was used to create a definite failure of fusion (Group I). Seven dogs were treated with a traditional anterior arthrodesis with an autogenous ulnar strut and without instrumentation (Group II). The remaining seven dogs were treated with an ulnar strut and anterior Kaneda instrumentation that was of an appropriate size for the dog (Group III). At twenty-four weeks, the results were analyzed in terms of the rate of fusion, biomechanical rigidity, neuropathological findings, and histomorphometric data on the vertebral response. The rate of fusion was significantly higher in Group III, in which the Kaneda device had been used, than it was in either Group I or Group II, in which instrumentation had not been used. Biomechanically, the spines in Group III were stiffer in torsion than those in Group I or II. There was no difference between groups in terms of the number of neuropathological changes in the spinal cord. Histomorphometric analysis showed that no meaningful device-related osteopenia occurred in the vertebrae that were spanned by the fixation device. Trabecular density was increased in the vertebrae in which the instrumentation was anchored.\r"

The early compromise of the upper airway was believed to be due to edema rather than to the formation of a hematoma. Five patients had no sequelae, but two died of complications related to the obstruction. Risk factors common to these patients included moderate or severe myelopathy and multilevel corpectomy. Six patients had a history of heavy smoking and one, of asthma. We believe that extra caution should be used in the postoperative management of the airways when multilevel corpectomy is performed in patients who have these pre-existing conditions.\r"

In the present study, carbodiimide and glutaraldehyde-cross-linked collagen implants and autogenous grafts that served as controls were implanted for fifty-two weeks as a replacement for a three-centimeter section of the Achilles tendon of rabbits. The absence of a crimp in a cross-linked implant and the presence of a crimp in normal tendon and in tendon that formed after an implant had been resorbed made it possible to distinguish between a cross-linked implant and new host tendon that had replaced the implant after it was resorbed. New collagen that had replaced the implant and autogenous (control) tendon graft were compared with normal Achilles tendon with respect to the angle and length of the crimp. The autogenous grafts and the carbodiimide-cross-linked collagen implants had been completely resorbed and replaced by neotendon. The neotendon that was present fifty-two weeks after implantation was similar, but not identical, to normal tendon. In contrast, the glutaraldehyde-cross-linked implant was essentially inert, had not been resorbed, and was surrounded by a capsule of collagenous connective tissue. The neotendon in the capsule was also similar, but not identical, to normal tendon. There were more cells in the capsule than in the autogenous grafts or in the carbodiimide-cross-linked implants. The results of the present study indicate that rapid repair is achieved with a carbodiimide-cross-linked collagenous implant that has a structure and mechanical properties that are similar to those of an autogenous tendon graft and that biodegrades at a similar rate. Prolonged biodegradation of a glutaraldehyde-cross-linked collagenous implant results in formation of a capsule and only limited formation of neotendon.\r"

At the time of the operation, the fibular collateral ligament and the tendon of the biceps femoris were reattached, but no attempt was made to stabilize the fibula otherwise. The patients were tested an average of sixty-one months after operation. Stability of the knee was measured with an instrumented system. Gait was evaluated with an optical electronic three-dimensional digitizing system and a multicomponent force-platform. The gait of six healthy control subjects of similar age was also studied, and the reproducibility of measurements of stability of the knee was investigated in four healthy adults. There were significant differences between the side on which an operation had been done and the contralateral side with regard to the extent of anterior translation and of total anterior-posterior translation of the tibia at both 20 and 90 degrees of flexion of the knee, and in total varus and valgus rotation of the knee (the number of degrees from a position of maximum varus to one of maximum valgus angulation) at 20 degrees of flexion. The measurements of gait and of motion of the knee were found to be normal when compared with those in the control subjects. In the ground-reaction measurements, there were some significant differences from normal in the medial-lateral plane, but they were clinically unimportant. Resection of the proximal part of the fibula can lead to instability of the knee.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective study of thirty-eight patients (seventy-six knees) who had had a primary bilateral total knee replacement and twelve patients (twenty-four hips) who had had a primary bilateral total hip replacement was conducted to assess the effect of postoperative suction drainage on wound-healing. A suction drain was placed on each patient's right operative wound, while no drains were used on the left. Otherwise, the same operative technique and method of closure were used in all wounds. Statistical analysis of the results showed no difference between the two sides with regard to the incidences of swelling or persistent drainage. Return of active function of the quadriceps and of range of motion of the knee in patients who had had a total knee replacement was also unaffected by the use of suction drains. We concluded that the routine use of suction drains for wounds is unnecessary after uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty.\r"

  ".W": "A retrospective review was undertaken of thirty-seven hips (thirty-four patients) that had had a complex cemented total hip arthroplasty. In these hips, circumstances had necessitated that the center of the hip be placed farther proximally, as measured from the interteardrop line, than the anatomical position that is normally used. The mean duration of clinical and roentgenographic follow-up was eleven years (range, seven to seventeen years), and the mean age of the patients was fifty-one years (range, sixteen to seventy-three years). Most of these hips had a major deficiency or defect of the acetabular bone stock, or both. Of the six acetabular components (16 per cent) that became loose and were followed for ten years, only one needed revision. Because this study was aimed specifically at assessment of the acetabular component, if the femoral component alone needed revision, the final clinical rating that was used was the one obtained after the femoral revision. Thirty-one hips (84 per cent) were rated as having a good or excellent result; they had an average Harris hip-rating score of 43 points preoperatively and 93 points postoperatively. Thirty-three of the thirty-seven acetabular components were not substantially displaced laterally as compared with the anatomical location that is normally used. Our findings suggest that, when circumstances dictate, proximal positioning of the acetabular component without lateral displacement can give an acceptable result in cemented total hip-replacement procedures.\r"

It is also clear that ISH will continue to have an important research role. In diagnostic pathology the technique is already providing valuable information and the present decade should see the development of many more diagnostic applications.\r"

Compared with controls, children with TDS had increased IgM lamina propria plasma cells and decreased intraepithelial T cells. There was also an increase in crypt epithelial cell proliferation. Lamina propria T cells (both activated and non-activated) were no more common in children with the Trichuris syndrome than controls. Epithelial cell HLA-DR and VLA-1 expression (which are increased in other colitides) were the same in both groups. Despite the presence of large worm burdens and chronic dysentery, therefore, only minor changes were seen in the caecal mucosa of children with TDS.\r"

The presence of an amyloid was confirmed in all 21 cases. Seventeen cases contained P component and either amyloid A (AA) (11 cases) or an immunoglobulin light chain associated amyloid (six cases). Four cases contained amyloid material with unusual immunohistochemical findings; one case had AA and P-component (PC) in the interstitium, one case had lambda light chain and beta-2 microglobulin, one case had kappa light chain and Clq, and one case had lambda light chains only. It was possible, therefore, to identify precisely the amyloid constituents and thereby \"type\" the amyloid by immunohistochemical means. The availability of the antibodies used and their application using these techniques could simplify the confirmation of clinically suspected amyloidosis.\r"

When ductal carcinomas were subdivided according to their dominant growth pattern, the carcinomas with a solid or comedo growth pattern showed the highest proliferative activity. These results largely confirm data from previous cell kinetic studies on the incorporation of radioactively labelled thymidine. A correlation between the growth fraction determined by Ki-67 in fine needle aspiration smears and cryostat sections of corresponding tumours was shown, implying that the immunostaining of cytological smears gives a reliable impression of the growth fraction of a tumour and may therefore be used in prospective studies.\r"

These included the polyclonal antibody 21N and the monoclonal antibody 4D5. The tumours were divided into two main groups. The first included 75 cases of invasive ductal and classic invasive lobular carcinomas. The second group consisted of 74 cases with histological types known to have a good prognosis, including mucinous, alveolar variant of invasive lobular, medullary, tubular, cribriform and papillary carcinomas. Fifteen (20%) tumours of the first group were positive with the two antibodies. Fourteen of these were of the ductal type and one was a mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma. Ten of the pure ductal cases had areas of comedo carcinoma. The intraductal elements in a further tumour were positively stained with 21N antibody only. None of the second group of tumours, which included histological types known to have good prognosis, stained with 4D5, although one mucinous carcinoma was positively stained with 21N. These findings suggest that in invasive breast carcinoma immunostaining for c-erbB-2 is mainly seen in a subgroup of ductal tumours, and that almost all other histological types, especially those associated with good prognosis, lack this expression.\r"

Aneuploidy was rare (n = 16) and had no effect on length of survival or transformation to high grade lymphoma. The overall mean S-phase fraction was 3.6%; for the whole series increasing S-phase fraction was associated with decreased survival. A high S-phase fraction (more than 5%) in initial biopsy specimens was also associated with an increased risk of subsequent high grade transformation at relapse. There was no difference between the survival or proliferative activity of tumours composed of mainly small cleaved cells compared with those composed of mixed small and large cells. There was no difference in survival or proliferative activity between tumours showing a pure follicular growth pattern and those with a mixed follicular and diffuse growth pattern. Multifactorial analysis showed that an S-phase fraction of more than 5% and B symptoms were the most important factors determining survival in these follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the accuracy of several methods for measuring the monocyte count, the results obtained by a number of different automated cell counters were analysed. Considerable discrepancies occurred for monocyte counts obtained in normal blood among the counters. The results of a visual monocyte count on a total of 800 leucocytes were used as the reference method. The technique of measuring the monocyte count by using dual staining with monoclonal antibodies CD45 and CD14 provided the closest agreement with the reference method. Six other automated counting systems were assessed. Two of these systems (Coulter VCS and Technicon H1) gave results, which, although under-estimating monocytosis, correlated well with the results obtained by the reference technique. A third system (Toa Sysmex NE-8000) gave unreliable results. Three of the automated systems evaluated measured a \"third population\"--that is, monocytes together with other leucocytes. One of these systems (Ortho ELT 1500), overestimated the count, as expected, but correlated well with the reference method. The second of these \"third population counters\" (Coulter S Plus IV) correlated moderately well with the reference monocytosis, while the Toa Sysmex E-5000 correlated poorly. It is clear that problems exist in the evaluation of different instruments for counting monocytes. An accurate and reliable reference method is a pre-requisite to evaluate this aspect of cell counters. As the visual method is too cumbersome a different reference method would be useful. Based on the results of this study, it is suggested that the technique using fluorescence labelled monoclonal antibodies should be regarded as an acceptable alternative.\r"

Serial measurements of the serum concentration of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, and percentage parasitaemia were determined, together with initial measurement of serum electrolytes, liver function, haemoglobin, white cell and platelet counts. Initial C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A concentrations were increased (C-reactive protein mean 49.0 mg/l serum amyloid A 28 mg/l) falling towards the normal range by the seventh day of treatment. There was a significant correlation between the pretreatment parasite count and clinical and laboratory markers of inflammation. C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A concentrations correlated inversely with the serum sodium. These results indicate that measurement of acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A may prove valuable in assessing the severity of P falciparum malaria, and in following the response to antimalarial treatment.\r"

All men were part of a long-term survey. Smokers had significantly higher plasma leucocyte elastase concentrations than ex-smokers or those who had never smoked. Mean current FEV1 was lower, and the annual decline in FEV1 in the preceding 10 years was faster in smokers than the other two groups. A few smokers had slight increases in serum C-reactive protein concentrations. Although peripheral blood leucocyte counts were higher in smokers than in non-smokers or ex-smokers, no association was found in any of the three groups of men between plasma elastase concentration and peripheral leucocyte count, nor between either of these two variables and annual decline in FEV1 or current level of FEV1. There was also no relation between plasma elastase concentration and reported daily cigarette consumption or mixed expired carbon monoxide in smokers. The results indicate that some male smokers have increased in vivo release of elastase from peripheral blood neutrophils at a time when there is no evidence of acute infection. Because leucocyte elastase is a strong candidate for pulmonary tissue damage, further studies of the mechanisms that increase plasma concentrations are indicated.\r"

Plasma histamine concentrations were significantly increased in all four patient groups when compared with those of controls and were the highest in two patients with pruritus. Raised plasma histamine concentrations in such patients are consistent with the hypothesis that histamine may contribute to the damage to glomerular capillaries and to arterial endothelium. These effects may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glomerular disease and atherosclerosis. Histamine may also contribute to the pathogenesis of pruritus in patients with chronic renal failure.\r"

This was assessed by comparing the results of the kits with those from an ELISA specifically measuring antibodies against highly purified dsDNA, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), native DNA and histones. The RIA and two of the ELISAs seemed equally efficient at detecting antibodies to dsDNA, but all three also detected anti-ssDNA (the RIA being particularly bad for this). The need for highly purified dsDNA was clearly shown. The results obtained with one ELISA did not correlate with any variable investigated in this study. A total of 220 sera were assayed with the IDS RIA, of which 130 were recorded as positive. Of these, 50 sera seemed to contain no identifiable autoantibodies. This very high false positive rate may be due, at least in part, to precipitation of nonspecifically bound labelled DNA.\r"

Overall (17 cases) the cell phenotype distribution was 65% B cell, 24% T cell, and 11% null. High CSF lymphocyte counts were found in 94%, proteinosis in 85%, and low CSF glucose in 87%. In contrast to the B cell tumours, all of the T cell tumours were diagnosed by CSF cytology before being visualised radiologically. It is suggested that all CSF lymphocytes (greater than 5 x 10(6)/ml) should be immunohistochemically typed to permit earlier diagnosis of CNS non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

In the collagenous scar-like areas, however, these cells were fewer in number and their FXIIIa expression was depleted. These findings suggest that cells containing FXIIIa have an important role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin.\r"

This CD3+ CD5- population may rise transiently in patients who have received an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and in patients following completion of intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These findings suggest that these CD3+ CD5- cells are a normal component of the regenerating lymphoid system after BMT or chemotherapy.\r"

Complete measurements of esophageal manometry were performed before and every 30 minutes for 210 minutes after the administration of the drugs. Esophageal pH was measured continuously for the duration of the experiment. The results demonstrate that (1) salbutamol had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient, the peak esophageal contraction pressure, or the number and duration of reflux episodes in patients with asthma and normal individuals, and (2) patients with asthma have a resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure higher than healthy subjects. We conclude that the administration of salbutamol does not affect esophageal function.\r"

The treatment was started in patients who had one or more severe attacks per month. In 24 patients, the therapy lasted for more than 5 years. The minimal effective dose usually did not exceed 2 mg/day of stanozolol or 200 mg/day of danazol. Only in two patients were these doses not sufficient to achieve the complete disappearance of symptoms. Irregular menstruation, but rarely amenorrhea, was the only significant side effect. One patient had to stop the therapy because of laboratory signs of hepatic cell necrosis. In one patient, danazol was administered during the last 8 weeks of pregnancy without side effects for the mother but with transient signs of virilization for the female baby. To find a biochemical marker for the minimal effective dose of androgen derivatives, we measured the plasma levels of C1 C1 INH complexes at different doses of stanozolol in four patients with hereditary angioedema. We found that these complexes, elevated before treatment, promptly reverted to normal values during androgen therapy and remained normal with any reduction of the dose of the drug as long as the patient remained symptom free. Therefore, the measurement of C1 C1 INH complexes appears to reflect the activity of the disease and not the amount of androgen that is administered.\r"

None of eight patients with another skin disorder, psoriasis, screened in a similar fashion, had a positive methacholine challenge. We conclude that hyperresponsive airways are a frequent finding in patients with AD and that similar mechanisms may account for the cutaneous physiologic and pharmacologic abnormalities that have been observed in AD.\r"

The major allergen causing the epidemics was a glycopeptide less than 14 kd molecular mass abundant in soybean dust. This allergen occurs in all parts of the soybean plant at all stages of growth, but the telae (hulls) and pods are by far the richest source. Small amounts of a similar cross-reacting allergen are found in some other grain dusts. The botanical function and significance of this soybean plant component is not known nor is the potential for airborne dispersion of this allergen at other grain-handling sites.\r"

The fractions were dialyzed and lyophilized. The 4 mol/L fraction accounted for 79% of the dry weight and most of the carbohydrate content. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fractions demonstrated significant interfraction differences with the largest number of silver-stained bands in the H2O fraction. Although individual differences in skin reactivity to the fractions were present, geometric means of histamine equivalent pricks were approximately the same with only a 0.5 log dilution higher potency for the 1 mol/L and H2O fractions. The 50% IgE ELISA-inhibition concentration was 100 micrograms/ml for the 1 mol/L and distilled water fractions and 10 micrograms/ml for the other fractions. Since the 4 mol/L fraction accounted for most of the dry weight and had the highest carbohydrate to protein ratio (5.8), purification of Alternaria extracts by removal of carbohydrate fractions may result in significant loss of allergenic material.\r"

Six patients with asthma (mean methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was 0.26 mg/ml) and six control subjects underwent fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar wash. The patients with asthma shed a higher number of epithelial cells into lavage fluid than normal control subjects (p less than 0.05). Their lavage fluid also contained increased numbers of neutrophils (p less than 0.025), eosinophils (p less than 0.025), and basophilic cells (p less than 0.025), and increased proportion of activated T cells (p less than 0.05). The basophilic cells were mast cells, as indicated by positive labeling with the monoclonal antibody MCG35. Biochemical analysis of lavage fluid demonstrated exudation of protein molecules in airways of patients with asthma with increased contents of albumin (p less than 0.05) and fibronectin (p less than 0.05). In the lavage fluid of patients with asthma, there were also increased amounts of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) (p less than 0.025), interleukin-6 (IL-6) (p less than 0.025), and granulocyte-macrophage, colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (p less than 0.05), as compared with lavage fluid of normal control subjects. Immunocytochemical evaluation of lavage cells demonstrated that IL-1-beta, IL-6, and GM-CSF were mostly produced by nonciliated epithelial cells and/or monocytes. IL-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF can prime granulocytes to respond to other stimuli and can promote T cell activation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Nedocromil sodium caused dose-related inhibition of HRA-N generation by human neutrophils (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L; inhibitory concentration of 50%, 1.5 x 10(-8) mol/L). In contrast, the presence of nedocromil sodium had no effect on HRA-N-mediated serotonin release from RBL cells. In five experiments, with one crude and four partially purified HRA-N preparations, serotonin release from RBL cells exposed to native HRA-N or HRA-N in the presence of nedocromil sodium (10(-4) mol/L) was 28% +/- 6% and 26% +/- 5%, respectively. Similar results were found with all concentrations of nedocromil sodium studied. Preincubation of RBL cells with nedocromil sodium (10(-4) mol/L) for 0 to 60 minutes also did not affect HRA-N-mediated serotonin release. Likewise, nedocromil sodium (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L) had no effect on anti-IgE-induced serotonin release from RBL cells. In 10 experiments, anti-IgE alone or in the presence of nedocromil sodium (10(-4) mol/L) induced 32% +/- 6% and 32% +/- 5% serotonin release, respectively. Preincubation of RBL cells with nedocromil sodium before anti-IgE exposure had no further effect. This is the first study of pharmacologic manipulation of the generation of a histamine-releasing factor. It is hypothesized that one possible mechanism whereby nedocromil sodium protects against asthma and allergic rhinitis is through inhibition of HRA-N generation.\r"

After its final approval as a sweetener in 1981, a number of reports of adverse reactions to aspartame appeared in the literature. To explore the pathogenesis of such reactions, we initiated a study in July 1986 to identify subjects with hypersensitivity reactions to aspartame with blinded challenge procedures. The study was closed after 32 months. During that time, we advertised in local newspapers and worked closely with the local community of allergists and dermatologists in an attempt to recruit subjects with hypersensitivity reactions to aspartame. A total of 61 self-referrals and physician referrals were screened, with 20 referrals evaluated in clinic. After this evaluation, 12 patients underwent single- and double-blind challenge with up to 2000 mg of aspartame. No subject with a clearly reproducible adverse reaction to aspartame was identified. In summary, we found that it is difficult to recruit study subjects with a history of hypersensitivity reactions to aspartame and that subjects who believed themselves allergic to aspartame did not have reproducible reactions.\r"

The assay did not react with noncockroach-allergen sources. Dust samples from 73 households in a cockroach-infested area were assayed. The concentration in these samples varied from below detection to 200,000 ng of Per a eq/gm of dust. Three commercial cockroach-allergen extracts all contained the allergen. The assay will be valuable for studies of the clinically relevant cockroach-allergen exposure levels and for assessment of efficacy of allergen-avoidance measures.

In monkeys, we have reported that antigen (Ag) inhalation induces a prolonged airway eosinophilia, that chronic airway eosinophilia is associated with marked airway hyperresponsiveness, and that chronic Ag inhalations induce airway eosinophilia and hyperresponsiveness. In this study we have determined the effects of acute Ag inhalation(s) on airway responsiveness to obtain a protocol for the study of the mechanisms involved. Anesthetized and intubated adult male cynomolgus monkeys with a naturally occurring sensitivity to Ascaris suum extract were studied. Airway responsiveness (provocative concentration of nebulized and inhaled methacholine that induced a 100% increase in respiratory system resistance [Rrs] [PC100]; twofold decrease regarded as significant) and airway cell composition (bronchoalveolar lavage [BAL]) were determined 1 day before and 20 hours after a single inhalation of Ascaris extract, or 3 days before and 3 days after three alternate-day inhalations of Ascaris extract. The single inhalation of Ag (N = 7) caused an acute increase in Rrs (307% +/- 62%), an increase in BAL leukocytes, and a decrease in PC100 in three animals that was moderate (more than eightfold) in two animals. The mean +/- SE change in log PC100 was only -0.25 +/- 0.24. The multiple inhalations of Ag in the same animals caused acute increases in Rrs (178% +/- 48%, 380% +/- 83%, and 331% +/- 63%, respectively), an increase in BAL granulocytes, and a decrease in PC100 in six of seven animals (mean +/- SE change in log PC100 was -1.36 +/- 0.34) that was moderate in two and severe (more than 80-fold) in three animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To determine why patients with allergic rhinitis alone differ in their airway response to inhaled allergen compared to patients with allergic asthma, bronchial lavage was performed in 10 subjects with allergic asthma and in five subjects with allergic rhinitis, before and after inhalation challenge with antigen to produce an immediate asthmatic reaction. Before antigen challenge, the subjects with asthma had higher absolute neutrophil counts in the lavage fluid. After antigen challenge, the subjects with asthma released significant amounts of bronchoconstrictive mediators, such as histamine and thromboxane B2 into the lavage fluid, whereas subjects with rhinitis alone did not. There was also a significant increase in prostaglandin E2 in the subjects with asthma after antigen challenge. Nonimmunologic bronchoconstriction with methacholine inhalation challenge in six other subjects with asthma did not demonstrate an increase in any of the lavage fluid mediator levels that were measured. A positive correlation was found between methacholine provocative concentration causing a 20% drop in FEV1 and the concentration of prostaglandin E2 in the lavage fluid before challenge. The significance of this observation has yet to be determined. The results suggest that subjects with allergic asthma differ from subjects with rhinitis alone in their capacity to release more mediators into the airways on antigen challenge. It is not known whether this increase in mediators is due to increase in the number of mast cells in the airways or due to increase in mediator releasability from the mast cells of subjects with asthma.\r"

These patients differ from patients previously reported because of the markedly elevated IgM M-component concentration in one patient and the severity of anemia in the second patient. An increased frequency of IgG autoantibodies to interleukin-1-alpha has been reported by other investigators; it has been suggested that an antibody-mediated prolongation of the half-life of interleukin-1-alpha might account for some of the symptoms and signs of this disorder. However, neither the mediators involved in the induction of nonpruritic urticaria nor the role of the IgM M component has been established.\r"

Our expectation was that IT would have a preferential effect on the LPR, and our aim was to understand the mechanism. Twenty-one ragweed hay fever-sensitive subjects were treated with a moderate dose of antigen extract (maintenance dose of 1.94 micrograms of antigen E (Amb a I)) during a period of 8 months (total dose equivalent to 24 micrograms of antigen E), and 20 matched subjects received placebo injections in a double-blind manner. Both groups underwent identical nasal challenges and intradermal skin tests with ragweed-antigen extract both before (1985) and during (1986) IT. Symptom and medication diaries, recorded during seasonal exposure, and changes in specific serum IgE and IgG antibodies confirmed the efficacy of the administered IT dose. Between-group analysis revealed that IT significantly reduced the levels of histamine, TAME-esterase activity, and kinins, as well as symptoms of rhinorrhea and congestion generated during the ER to nasal challenge. Within-group paired analysis demonstrated ER, LPR, and RCR mediators and symptoms also to be reduced by IT. Surprisingly, the placebo-treated group demonstrated an increase in the ER. There was no decrease of the LPR without an antecedent decrease of the ER. IT did not clearly change the late cellular inflammatory response. In the case of skin challenge, IT significantly reduced the cutaneous ER. The reduction of the cutaneous LPR was more pronounced. We speculate that moderate-dose IT ameliorates seasonal symptoms of allergic rhinitis by reducing the ER, LPR, and RCR to antigen challenge but does not preferentially reduce the nasal LPR.\r"

This investigation assessed the incidence of immediate generalized reactions (IGRs) to repeated RCM IGRs in pretreated high-risk patients who received iopamidol or iohexol during 200 procedures (181 intravascular). All patients had experienced a previous IGR to a conventional RCM. Pretreatment consisted of prednisone, 50 mg, 13, 7, and 1 hour before the procedure and diphenhydramine, 50 mg, 1 hour before the procedure in 140 intravascular infusions. Ephedrine, 25 mg, 1 hour before the infusion was added to prednisone-diphenhydramine in 41 cases. Only one (0.7%) urticarial reaction occurred in 141 procedures with prednisone-diphenhydramine. No repeated IGR occurred with the three-drug regimen. The reaction rate after pretreatment with prednisone-diphenhydramine or prednisone-diphenhydramine-ephedrine and use of conventional contrast media during 800 intravascular procedures was 9.1%, and with pretreatment and lower osmolality contrast media in 181 intravascular infusions, it was 0.5% (chi 2 = 14.35; p less than 0.001). Lower osmolality contrast media should be the contrast media of choice for patients with a prior IGR to conventional contrast media. In addition, patients should receive prednisone-diphenhydramine-ephedrine or prednisone-diphenhydramine prophylaxis.\r"

In January 1990, 20 patients were reviewed. Their degree of drooling pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively and currently was assessed. The rate of improvement and the occurrence of complications were noted. Drooling was 'much better' in the early post-operative period in 17 of the 20 patients, and this improvement was invariably noted within three weeks. In the three other patients drooling was 'better'. Deterioration occurred in only three patients over the entire follow-up period.

A follow-up barium swallow disclosed a pathological lesion in a significant proportion of patients with bolus obstruction, whether or not this was passed spontaneously.\r"

The aim of this study was to ascertain whether oxygen desaturation occurs with nasal occlusion by post-operative packing. Continuous digital pulse oximetry was carried out before and after submucous resection of the nasal septum in 17 otherwise healthy patients. Post-operative nasal packing produced a statistically significant change in oxygen saturation during sleep. The change was, however, of such small magnitude that it is unlikely to be clinically significant.\r"

This indicates a high degree of internal consistency, i.e.: statistically this scale is measuring aspects of a single dimension. The validity was established in a separate sample of 30 clinic attenders, where mean S.T.S.S. scores were found to correlate highly with two independent clinical ratings of severity (r2 = 0.76, p less than 0.001, and r2 = 0.73, p less than 0.001).

  ".W": "In a series of 75 patients with surgically treated lipomyelomeningoceles, the neurological condition of six patients deteriorated 6 months to 14 years after the operation due to repeat tethering of the spinal cord. The tethering resulted from postoperative dense adhesion between the cord and the overlying dura mater. Two of the six patients underwent conventional repeat untethering procedures, and the remaining four were successfully treated with a new surgical technique developed by the authors to prevent such dural adhesion. For this procedure, after complete untethering of the spinal cord, the lumbosacral cord is retained in the center of the dural sac by fine stay sutures between the pia mater of the conus medullaris and the ventral dura mater. In addition, the dura mater is tacked to the posterior arch which is reconstructed with bone grafts at one or two bifid vertebral levels. During a postoperative follow-up period of 1 to 3 years, no further deterioration has been observed and magnetic resonance studies have demonstrated a space filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the lumbosacral cord. The authors conclude that long-term observation, both neurological and radiological, is essential even after successful repair of a lipomyelomeningocele. This new surgical procedure can maintain a CSF bath around the lumbosacral cord, thus preventing dural adhesion. Application of this technique will hopefully be beneficial in lipomyelomeningocele patients with a high risk of cord retethering after initial repair.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative venous infarction following aneurysm surgery was studied in 48 patients with anterior communicating artery aneurysms operated on through the interhemispheric approach at the acute stage of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Of 23 patients whose bridging veins were sacrificed during surgery, 11 (47.8%) showed venous infarction in the frontal lobes. In contrast, only one (5.9%) of 17 patients whose bridging veins were preserved developed cerebral edema. None of eight patients who were operated on after Day 11 (the day of SAH was defined as Day 0) showed this complication, although bridging veins were sacrificed in six of them. Venous infarction following acute aneurysm surgery tended to occur more frequently in patients of higher SAH grade and/or more advanced age, but these correlations were not significant. However, the correlation between the sacrifice of veins and venous infarction was significant (p less than 0.025). Because this potential complication may compromise the benefit of acute aneurysm surgery and cause damage, it is important to preserve the venous system and in some instances to select another surgical approach based on the pattern of venous drainage in the frontal lobe.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-eight patients with histologically verified spinal cord ependymomas were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Atkinson Morley's Hospital between 1950 and 1987. The median age in this series was 40 years (range 1 to 79 years) and the male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Ten patients had tumors in the cervical cord and 10 in the thoracic cord; 14 tumors involved the conus medullaris and 24 the cauda equina. Forty ependymomas were grade I and 13 were grades II to IV (in five patients there was insufficient material for grading). Eleven patients underwent biopsy only, 33 had partial or subtotal resection, and 14 had complete resection. Forty-three patients received postoperative radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 70 months (range 3 to 408 months). Cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 68% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. On univariate analysis, age, histological grade, postoperative neurological function, and era of treatment were significant prognostic factors for survival. The histological grade was the only significant independent prognostic factor. The relative risk of death from ependymoma was 9.0 for patients with tumor grades II to IV compared to grade I (p less than 0.005, 95% confidence interval 2.7 to 30). The survival rates of patients following complete excision were significantly better compared to those after incomplete surgery (p less than 0.025). The majority of completely resected neoplasms were low-grade cauda equina tumors. Despite incomplete surgery, 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates following radical radiotherapy were both 59%, and cause-specific survival rates were 69% at 5 years and 62% at 10 years. This suggests that radiotherapy may achieve long-term tumor control in over half of those patients with residual spinal ependymoma.\r"

The endocrinological complications of radiation therapy and the effectiveness of growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy were assessed. These were the first 2 years after synthetic GH became available. The disease pathology was confirmed at craniotomy or biopsy in 108 patients. Ninety-five children completed radiation therapy and 65 of these were alive at the time of review; these 65 children represent the study population. The most common tumor types were medulloblastoma, craniopharyngioma, and ependymoma. Endocrine evaluation was initiated with changes in the patients' growth velocity. Patient workup included skeletal x-ray films for determination of bone and analysis of thyroxin, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and somatomedin-C levels. Following 1-dopa and clonidine stimulation, provocative studies of GH levels were performed. Growth hormone failure and short stature were observed in 26 children, most commonly in the 2nd year after tumor treatment. Eight patients with GH failure were also hypothyroid. Hormone replacement therapy was initiated with recombinant GH, 0.05 mg/kg/day, and all children so treated showed an increase in height, with eight patients experiencing catch-up growth. There were no complications of therapy or tumor recurrence. Studies of baseline bone age and somatomedin-C levels on completion of radiation therapy are recommended. Comprehensive endocrine studies should follow changes in the patients' growth velocity. With early GH replacement, catch-up growth is possible and normal adult heights may be achieved.\r"

Ten of the patients had intracanalicular tumors and 46 had extracanalicular tumors. It was possible to obtain BAER's following stimulation of the affected side in 28 patients and after stimulation of the unaffected side in all 56. Five patients (11%) had normal BAER's following stimulation of both sides; three of these patients had intracanalicular tumors. Among BAER's obtained following stimulation of the affected ear, the mean interpeak latency (IPL) for peaks I to III associated with extracanalicular tumors was significantly prolonged relative to controls (p less than 0.001), and linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between tumor size and IPL of peaks I to III (p less than 0.05). Analysis of the 56 BAER's recorded after stimulation of the unaffected side revealed a significant positive correlation between the IPL's of peaks III to V and tumor size (p less than 0.001). This correlation was not strengthened when accounting for the degree of brain-stem compression. Finally, evidence of preserved function within the auditory pathway, even in the presence of partial hearing loss, is presented. This finding suggests that more patients might benefit from surgical procedures that spare the eighth cranial nerve.\r"

  ".W": "Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis is a rare disorder usually characterized by primarily cutaneous or neurological symptoms. Approximately 40 cases of malignant angioendotheliomatosis with primary central nervous system (CNS) symptoms have been reported. Some investigators have postulated a hematopoietic origin for this neoplasm. Most of the literature, however, has perpetuated the idea that the often bizarre symptoms seen with this entity result from neoplastic endothelial cell proliferation within the small vessels of affected organs, including the brain and spinal cord. This report describes the immunohistochemical examination and confirmation of the cell of origin of this neoplasm based on five previously unpublished cases of malignant angioendotheliomatosis with primarily CNS symptoms. It includes the first documentation of a T-cell lymphoma presenting as malignant angioendotheliomatosis. All cases include autopsy findings, and in four cases the diagnosis was made postmortem. One case was proven by stereotactic biopsy, but the patient succumbed as a result of severe intracranial bleeding that occurred at the time of biopsy. Tissues were studied with avidin-biotin peroxidase immunohistochemical techniques using a panel of monoclonal antibodies directed against the leukocyte common antigen, LN-1, LN-2, and anti-Factor VIII, and also using Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1. Based on the results obtained, the authors conclude that the proliferative cells seen within the vessel lumina are of lymphocytic origin and agree that the condition should more properly be designated intravascular lymphomatosis. The therapeutic implications of this conclusion point to the possible administration of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in an effort to achieve remissions in an otherwise relentlessly progressive neurological disorder.\r"

  ".U": "91193770\r", 
  ".W": "Intra-arterial carotid artery chemotherapy for malignant gliomas is limited by focal injuries to the eye and brain which may be caused by poor mixing of the drug with blood at the infusion site. This inadequate mixing can be eliminated in animal models with diastole-phased pulsatile infusion (DPPI) which creates 1-ml/sec spurts during the slow blood flow phase of diastole. Before treatment with intracarotid cisplatin, 10 patients with malignant gliomas were studied to determine whether intravascular streaming occurs after intracarotid infusion in humans, and if so, if it is reduced with DPPI. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies were performed by intravenous injection of H2(15)O and positron emission tomography. This was followed by supra- or infraophthalmic internal carotid artery (ICA) injections of H2(15)O with either continuous infusion or DPPI. Local H2(15)O concentration in the brain was determined and the images of radiotracer distribution in the continuous infusion and DPPI studies were compared to the rCBF images. Intravascular streaming of the infusate was identified by a heterogeneous distribution of the infused H2(15)O in brain compared to rCBF. Extensive and variable intravascular streaming occurred in three patients who received infusions into the supraophthalmic segment of the ICA. Some brain areas received up to 11 times the expected radiotracer delivery, while other regions received as little as one-tenth. This streaming pattern was markedly reduced or eliminated by DPPI. In the five patients who received infraophthalmic infusions, a minimally heterogeneous distribution of the infusate was detected. The authors conclude that extensive intravascular streaming accompanies supraophthalmic ICA infusions in patients. The magnitude of streaming can be substantially reduced or eliminated with DPPI. Those who perform intra-arterial infusion should consider using DPPI to assure uniform drug delivery to brain.\r"

  ".W": "Leukotrienes are powerful metabolites of arachidonic acid which are known to increase the permeability of peripheral blood vessels. These substances are found in brain tissue in association with cerebral ischemia, and in brain tumors. Therefore, it has been proposed that leukotrienes have a mediator function in brain edema. This hypothesis was subjected to further experimental analysis in this study, in which the authors investigated whether: 1) superfusion of the exposed brain surface with leukotrienes increases the permeability of extraparenchymal blood vessels in vivo; 2) intraparenchymal infusion of leukotrienes induces brain edema; and 3) pharmacological inhibition of leukotriene formation by BW755C, an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis, reduces formation of brain edema from a standardized traumatic insult. The pial vessels of the parietal cortex of cats were examined by fluorescence microscopy during cerebral superfusion with the leukotrienes C4 (LTC4), D4 (LTD4), or E4 (LTE4) by using an open cranial window preparation. Intravenous Na(+)-fluorescein served as an in vivo blood-brain barrier (BBB) indicator. Superfusion of the pia with leukotrienes (up to 2 microM) did not open the barrier to fluorescein, but was associated with a significant constriction (up to 25%) of arterial and venous vessels. In experiments with slow infusion of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) or LTC4 into the white matter of feline brain, the tissue water content was subsequently determined in serial brain slices using the specific gravity method. Tissue water profiles obtained after a 15-microM infusion of either LTB4 or LTC4 were virtually identical with those of control animals infused with mock cerebrospinal fluid. Thus, neither LTB4 nor LTC4 led to an augmentation of infusion-induced brain edema. In a final series, a cold lesion of the left parietal cortex was induced in rabbits. Twenty-four hours later, swelling of the exposed hemisphere was quantified by gravimetrical comparison of its weight with that of the contralateral nontraumatized hemisphere. Eight animals received BW755C intravenously prior to and after trauma to inhibit formation of leukotrienes. Seven rabbits were infused with an equivalent volume of saline as a control study. The resulting hemispheric swelling was 7.7% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- standard error of the mean) 24 hours later in animals receiving BW755C and 7.8% +/- 1.2% in the control group, indicating that inhibition of leukotrienes was ineffective in preventing formation of vasogenic brain edema. The findings demonstrate that leukotrienes administered to the brain in concentrations occurring under pathological conditions do not open the BBB nor do they induce brain edema.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The potential for hypothermia to prevent or ameliorate ischemic injury to the central nervous system is well known. To determine if a more prolonged period of metabolic suppression with blood substitution is possible, a method was developed to lower body temperature to near the freezing point. Eight adult mongrel dogs underwent closed-chest extracorporeal circulation with both external and internal body cooling. As they were cooled, progressive hemodilution was employed until complete exsanguination and blood substitution with an aqueous solution was accomplished. Continuous circulation and a core temperature at a mean of 1.7 degrees C were maintained from 2 1/2 to 3 hours. After rewarming to 20 degrees C, the animals were autotransfused and allowed to recover. Of the eight animals, two died due to technical factors related to cardiac defibrillation. Of the six surviving animals, five survived over a long period and one died on the 10th postoperative day with hepatorenal failure resulting from a presumed blood transfusion incompatability reaction. All six showed normal neurological function and kennel behavior, except one dog with mild weakness of a hindlimb. When the dogs were sacrificed 1 to 2 months postoperatively, all organs were histologically normal. Specifically, there was no gross or microscopic evidence of ischemic or hypoxic injury to any central nervous system structures. This pilot study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully achieve complete exsanguination, blood substitution, and ultraprofound body temperature, while continuous circulation of the blood substitute is maintained. With the capability of controlling and repeatedly performing washout of the extracellular environment and by reaching lower temperatures, it may be possible to attain greater cellular metabolic suppression. This perhaps will extend the allowable times for circulatory arrest procedures. In addition, \"bloodless ischemia\" may be beneficial in removing both blood substances and formed elements which may mediate organ ischemia. With replacement of blood at warm temperatures, coagulopathy is avoided. This preliminary evidence demonstrates potential in the combination of ultraprofound hypothermia and complete blood component substitution. However, further study is required to confirm the potential of achieving circulatory arrest of longer duration.\r"

The concentration of glutamate and aspartate was serially measured in extracellular fluid using in vivo microdialysis after induction of a subdural hematoma or after a sham operation in the rat. Measurements were made in the cortex underlying the hematoma and in the ipsilateral hippocampus, and these findings were correlated with regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured autoradiographically 2 hours after hematoma induction. In the severely ischemic cortex underlying the hematoma (mean CBF less than 25 ml/100 gm/min), glutamate and aspartate content increased more than 750% over basal levels. In individual animals the magnitude of glutamate release correlated with the extent of the focal ischemic zone under the hematoma (r = 0.907). Hippocampal glutamate levels rose 339%, yet regional CBF was preserved (114 ml/100 gm/min). This accords with focal hypermetabolism in this model, and may imply a glutamate-mediated \"excitotoxic\" process after subdural hematoma.\r"

She underwent transsphenoidal surgery after radiological investigation disclosed an enlarged pituitary gland which did not respond to bromocriptine therapy. The removed tissue had histological features consistent with adenohypophysitis including a diffuse lymphocytic infiltrate. The lymphocyte subsets present in the infiltrate were characterized by immunohistochemical methods to establish the contribution of different elements of the cellular immune response. Lymphocytes bearing CD4 antigen (helper-inducer cells) were most prominent and appeared to bear the majority of the interleukin-2 receptor (expressed during lymphocytic activation) present in the pituitary gland. A few B lymphocytes were also observed. The location of the major histocompatibility antigen (classes I and II) and interleukin-2 receptor correlated with the lymphocytes and macrophages rather than with the stromal or parenchymal elements of the pituitary. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is an unusual cause of pituitary enlargement which can mimic a pituitary tumor, and is sometimes associated with hyperprolactinemia. In women of child-bearing age, it almost always occurs during pregnancy or the postpartum stage. The autoimmune disorder reported here has not previously been associated with infertility nor has the lymphocytic infiltrate of the pituitary previously been analyzed in detail by modern immunological methods.\r"

All three patients obtained unequivocal benefit from this simple procedure. Postoperative magnetic resonance images showed considerable shrinkage of the cysts corresponding with clinical improvement.\r"

Based on the work of Parkinson, Dolenc, and other pioneering investigators, a comprehensive surgical approach for the treatment of lesions of the cavernous sinus is distilled and presented in 12 simple steps. The approach to surgical exploration of this region is divided into an extradural and intradural phase, each with six steps. The bony, neural, and/or vascular structures of each step are discussed. These steps may be used in their entirety for total exploration of the cavernous sinus, but also in part for lesions that involve only limited regions of the cavernous sinus. Either by design or circumstance, every intracranial neurosurgeon will eventually be led to the cavernous sinus region, and a clear understanding of cavernous sinus anatomy should be part of their armamentarium.\r"

The system consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a personal computer, and an image-processing unit. Utilizing recently developed magnetic field modulation technology, the three-dimensional digitizer determines the spatial position and orientation angles of the resin probe, triangle-shaped pointer, or suction tube with a small attached magnetic field sensor. Four fiducial markers on the scalp were used to translate the spatial data of the probe onto the preoperative CT scans or MR images of the patient. With this frameless, armless navigational system, CT or MR-imaging stereotaxy can be applied to conventional open neurosurgery without limiting the operative field or interfering with the surgical procedures.\r"

It was demonstrated that PET with carbon-11-methionine can give valuable complementary information in the diagnosis of this tumor due to PET's ability to adequately depict viable tumor tissue in contrast to fibrosis, cysts and necrosis. Furthermore, PET with dopamine D2 receptor ligands can characterize the degree of receptor binding and thus give information as to the prerequisites for dopamine agonist treatment. Most important is the very high sensitivity given by PET with carbon-11-methionine in the evaluation of treatment effects. It is concluded that when properly used PET can be fully justified in the clinical handling of patients with pituitary adenomas and other intracranial tumors.\r"

A summary of current clinical applications of PET in oncology is presented with special attention to colorectal, lung, and intracranial neoplasms since the majority of clinical trials have focused on these cancers. A variety of radiopharmaceuticals are described that are currently included in clinical tumor-imaging protocols, including metabolic substrates such as fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and carbon-11-methionine, and analogs of chemotherapeutic agents such as fluorine-18-fluorouracil and fluoroestradiol. An attempt is also made to include examples of clinical trials that demonstrate response to therapeutic intervention. The increasing number of oncologic PET studies reflects the growing interest in functional imaging in oncology.\r"

  ".W": "As surgical treatments for adult and pediatric forms of epilepsy have become more refined, methods for noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci have become increasingly important. Detection of focal brain metabolic or flow abnormalities is now well recognized as an essential step in the presurgical evaluation of many patients with epilepsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is most beneficial when used in the context of the total clinical evaluation of patients, including scalp EEG, invasive EEG, neuropsychologic testing, etc. Metabolic PET studies also give insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy. The dynamic nature of the interictal hypometabolism observed with 18[F]FDG in some patients suggests that excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters and their receptors may be involved. An exciting current application of PET scanning is the use of tracers for neurotransmitter receptors in the study of epilepsy patients. Mu and non-mu opiate receptors have been extensively studied and are beginning to give new insights into this disorder. Increased labeling of mu receptors in temporal neocortex using 11C-carfentanil has been demonstrated and, in some patients, supplements the clinical localization information from 18[F]FDG studies. Increased mu opiate receptor number or affinity is thought to play a role in anticonvulsant mechanisms. Specificity of increased mu receptors is supported by the absence of significant changes in non-mu opiate receptors. Other brain receptors are also of interest for future studies, particularly those for excitatory neurotransmitters. Combined studies of flow, metabolism, and neuroreceptors may elucidate the factors responsible for initiation and termination of seizures, thus improving patient treatment.\r"

Accordingly, regional uptake of 11C-acetate at 4 min was compared to regional perfusion determined with nitrogen-13-ammonia in 119 segments in 15 patients with stable coronary artery disease by two methods. A close correlation was observed between initial relative myocardial concentrations (segmental activity normalized to maximal activity) of both tracers (11C-acetate = 0.88; 13N-ammonia + 0.079; s.e.e. = 0.064, r = 0.94, p less than 0.001). Furthermore, segmental net extractions (E.F), as calculated from the input function and segmental activities, of the two tracers correlated closely by E.FC-11 = 0.55E.FN-13 + 0.080 (s.e.e. = 0.045, r = 0.87, p less than 0.001).

To determine the metabolic activity of these areas, the changes seen on stress/redistribution/reinjection thallium SPECT were compared with PET using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in 18 patients with coronary artery disease. Of 48 segments showing no redistribution on the delayed scan, the reinjection scan identified new fill-in in 20 segments (42%), all of which demonstrated FDG uptake. In contrast, only 7 of the 28 segments (25%) showing no fill-in after reinjection were PET viable (p less than 0.01). Eleven patients had coronary bypass graft surgery after the radionuclide study. The majority of the segments showing redistribution (87%) and new fill-in after reinjection (65%) improved in wall motion, whereas only eight segments (25%) without new fill-in improved after surgery. Of those without new fill-in, two segments showing PET ischemia improved in wall motion, whereas the remaining six segments showing PET scar did not improve after surgery. Thus, the segments showing new fill-in after reinjection are PET viable myocardium. However, reinjection thallium imaging still underestimates the extent of tissue viability compared to PET imaging.\r"

The standardized percent count increase from end-diastole to end-systole (S-percent Cl) was calculated as an index of wall thickening. The S-percent Cl was 77.8% +/- 28.9% in the segments with normal perfusion at rest, 51.9% +/- 29.5% in those with mild hypoperfusion, and 32.8% +/- 30.9% in those with severe hypoperfusion (p less than 0.001, each). Among the segments with resting hypoperfusion, the S-percent Cl was 38.9% +/- 31.5% in those without stress-induced ischemia and 48.7% +/- 30.9% in those with ischemia (p less than 0.05). Furthermore, among resting severe hypoperfusion, the S-percent Cl was 23.0% +/- 23.9% in the segments without fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake and 37.8 +/- 32.9% in those with FDG uptake (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that stress-induced ischemia and FDG accumulation correlated with wall thickening. Thus, quantitative analysis of regional wall thickening seems to be useful for combined analysis of regional function, perfusion and metabolism in coronary patients.\r"

The constraints included constant transport and phosphorylation ratios (tau and phi) and a common partition volume (K1/k2) for tracer [18F]FDG and glucose. In the presence of significant dephosphorylation, the k3*-model yielded time-dependent estimates of the phosphorylation coefficient (k3*), while the K4*-model yielded time-independent estimates. However, the two models yielded practically identical measurements of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in PET studies of six normal volunteers when the phosphorylation affinity ratio (the k3*/k3 ratio of FDG and glucose) and tracer circulation time were 0.30 and 20 min for the k3*-model and 0.33 and 45 min for the k4*-model.\r"

The time-activity curves were obtained for seven human organs (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and spleen) by using dynamic PET scans and for bladder content by using a single detector. These time-activity curves were used for the calculation of the cumulative activity in these organs. Absorbed doses were calculated by the MIRD method using the absorbed dose per unit of cumulated activity, \"S\" value, transformed for the Japanese physique and the organ masses of the Japanese reference man. The bladder wall and the heart were the organs receiving higher doses of 1.2 x 10(-1) and 4.5 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq, respectively. The brain received a dose of 2.9 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq, and other organs received doses between 1.0 x 10(-2) and 3.0 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq. The effective dose equivalent was estimated to be 2.4 x 10(-2) mSv/MBq. These results were comparable to values of absorbed doses reported by other authors on the radiation dosimetry of this radiopharmaceutical.\r"

The radiation dose to the bladder wall from injected 2-[18F]FDG was estimated using both a dynamic bladder model and the conventional MIRD model. The dynamic model takes into account the excretion rate, the varying size of the bladder, the volume at injection, and an estimated bladder time activity curve. Our data from 302 adult subjects in a five-year period indicate that when the bladder is large at the time of injection, the dose to the bladder is greatly reduced. The absorbed dose of the bladder based on the dynamic model for an initial volume of 450 ml is 0.16 +/- 0.06 rad/mCi, while that for an initial volume of 200 ml is calculated to be 0.37 +/- 0.18 rad/mCi. The MIRD model estimates an average value of 0.35 +/- 0.16 rad/mCi for the 302 cases.\r"

Using this ligand, D2 dopamine receptor density (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) in canine striatum were measured. After administering various doses of the ligand in nine experiments, regional uptake was followed by repeated PET scanning for up to 80 min. D2 dopamine receptor specific binding at equilibrium was defined as striatal minus occipital activity after partial volume correction. Bmax and Kd were estimated by Scatchard analysis to be 40.3 pmole/ml of tissue and 22.9 nM, respectively. When a low mass dose of the ligand was administered, the bound-to-free ligand ratio in the striatum at equilibrium was consistent with the Bmax/Kd value obtained from the Scatchard analysis. The present study demonstrates the importance of partial volume correction and the Bmax/Kd measurement in a single PET study with carbon-11-YM-09151-2.\r"

First, we evaluated whether errors in attenuation correction, which might occur during the development of pulmonary edema, significantly affect LWC and pulmonary blood flow (PBF) measurements obtained with PET. In 10 animals, PET scans of LWC and PBF were obtained before and after oleic acid induced lung injury. Changes in LWC and PBF after injury were underestimated by 12%-25% if the postinjury LWC scan was reconstructed using attenuation data obtained prior to injury, before lung density had changed, instead of attenuation data obtained after lung injury. Next, in four other dogs, we did not administer oleic acid, but instead instilled progressive amounts of autologous plasma into the left caudal lobe and obtained LWC measurements after each. Changes in LWC were linearly related to the amount of plasma instilled (r = 0.99). The average coefficient of variation for LWC in the control right lobe was 4 +/- 2% and the average percent change between measurements was 1.5% +/- 5.8%. The correlation of regional LWC determined gravimetrically after the last scan, when corrected for differences in regional lung density, with LWC determined by PET, was excellent (r = 0.92). We conclude that when the correct attenuation scan is used for emission scan reconstruction. PET measurements of LWC are accurate, linear, and reproducible.\r"

We have developed a noninvasive technique to measure lung serotonin uptake in man. We utilized the double indicator diffusion principle, a positron camera, 11C-serotonin as the substrate, and 11CO-erythrocytes as the vascular marker. From regions of interest around each lung, we recorded time-activity curves in 0.5-sec frames for 30 sec after a bolus injection of first the vascular marker 11CO-erythrocytes and 10 min later 11C-serotonin. A second uptake measurement was made after imipramine 25-35 mg was infused intravenously. In three normal volunteers, the single-pass uptake of 11C-serotonin was 63.9% +/- 3.6%. This decreased in all subjects to a mean of 53.6% +/- 1.4% after imipramine. The rate of lung washout of 11C was also significantly prolonged after imipramine. This noninvasive technique can be used to measure lung serotonin uptake to detect early changes in a variety of conditions that alter the integrity of the pulmonary endothelium.\r"

The arterial input function is derived from images of the left ventricular blood pool calibrated with 18F-plasma measurements. The approach is computationally fast enough to be used in a clinical environment. The MMRGlc parametric images improve myocardial contrast relative to non-parametric images, especially in studies with poor myocardial uptake of FDG. In addition, MMRGlc parametric images consolidate the large amount of data in a dynamic PET study into a clinically usable image set.\r"

The ligand was racemic (+/-)[11C] CGP 12177, a very potent hydrophilic antagonist of the beta-adrenergic receptor. A kinetic method appeared unsuitable because of the presence of metabolites which made the input function difficult to measure and also inaccurate. Therefore, a graphical method, based on a particular protocol, was proposed. The animals were injected with a trace amount of (+/-)[11C]CGP 12177, which was followed 40 min later by a second injection of radioligand with a low-specific activity. An additional injection of an excess of unlabeled CGP 12177 was administered after 90 min and allowed for the estimation of the dissociation rate constant. The main advantage of this graphical approach is that the results are obtained without having to measure the input function and therefore without estimating the metabolites. The average value of Bmax was 31 +/- 4 pmole/ml of tissue and the dissociation constant was 0.014 +/- 0.002 min-1.\r"

The innervation of synovium was compared in normal rats and rats with AA. Observations concordant with what has been reported for neuropeptide nerves in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are presented. It has been suggested that neural peptide substances are reduced in nerves of synovium from patients with RA. In the AA rat a specific reduction of lining zone and sublining nerves in the synovium was noted. The AA rat model is very suitable for studying the involvement of synovial nerves in arthritis, permitting optimal preservation of immunoreactive neural epitopes.\r"

We observed sensory nerves containing substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) as well as autonomic sympathetic fibers immunoreactive for neuropeptide tyrosine (NPY), its C terminal peptide (C-PON) and the catecholamine synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Three subpopulations of nerve fibers labelled with SP and CGRP were identified: some stained for SP or CGRP only and others contained both peptides. NPY/C-PON and TH labelled predominantly perivascular nerves. Quantification of immunostained nerves revealed a significantly decreased innervation of rheumatoid synovia. The densities of both PGP 9.5 and neuropeptide containing nerves were lower in all rheumatoid samples. Our results are compatible with a local release of neuropeptides into joint fluid and point to a disturbed neuronal control of rheumatoid synovial tissue.\r"

Rheumatoid synovial culture media were tested for their ability to stimulate cartilage degradation (proteoglycan release from bovine nasal cartilage discs) and thymocyte proliferation (3H-thymidine incorporation) in the absence or presence of anti-IL-1. Degradation of living cartilage, stimulated 2-fold by synovial culture media, was inhibited up to 80% by anti-IL-1. Residual breakdown in living cartilage and synovial culture media induced breakdown in dead cultures were of similar magnitude, and both were unaffected by antibody treatment. Proteoglycan products released from synovial culture media treated cartilage were of smaller average molecular weight (Sepharose CL-2B), and such size reduction was inhibited by anti-IL-1 treatment. Synovial culture media that stimulated cartilage degradation also stimulated thymocyte proliferation; the latter was fully suppressible by anti-IL-1. One of 8 synovial culture media contained an inhibitor(s) of thymocyte proliferation, removable by dialysis. We conclude (1) rheumatoid synovial catabolin activity is due to a form of IL-1. (2) A minor nonsuppressible component of synovial culture media stimulated breakdown, identical in living and killed cartilage, is due to passive transfer of enzymic activity. (3) Cultured rheumatoid synovium releases both IL-1 and an inhibitor(s) of IL-1 action.\r"

During a 2 year followup of 71 lupus patients, 38 episodes of disease exacerbation and 36 episodes of infection could be analyzed. Plasma samples were obtained at least once a month. CRP levels were increased (greater than 6 mg/l) during 25 of the 38 exacerbations and during 32 of the 36 infections. Median CRP levels during infection (60 mg/l; range 1-400) were higher than during disease exacerbation (16.5 mg/l; range 1-375) (p less than 0.05). Levels of CRP rose prior to the exacerbation (p less than or equal to 0.01) and fell afterwards (p less than or equal to 0.01). During exacerbations accompanied by serositis, median levels of CRP (76 mg/l; range 2-375) were higher than during exacerbations without serositis (16 mg/l; range 1-53) (p less than 0.02). CRP levels exceeding 60 mg/l during exacerbations without serositis indicated infection in all cases. Thus, measurement of CRP in SLE is valuable to distinguish between infection and exacerbation only in the absence of serositis.\r"

Synovitis was present in only 16 of 29 patients (55%) who underwent arthroscopy because of chronic knee pain and were found to have OA; no synovium from 50% of the 22 patients in this group with full thickness cartilage ulceration showed infiltration with mononuclear cells. Similarly, no evidence of synovitis was seen in biopsies from 7 of 14 additional patients with OA who did not have knee pain but who underwent arthroscopy to evaluate joint instability. An association was seen between synovial mononuclear cell infiltration and thickness of the synovial lining cell layer (p less than 0.03), but lining cell hyperplasia was found in samples from only 12% of the patients with OA in our series. The severity of OA cartilage lesions was unrelated to severity of synovitis and no topographic relationship was found between cartilage ulceration and synovitis.\r"

Both high (equine) and medium (human, Mr = 5.5 x 10(5) Da) molecular weight HA were cleaved by the complete myeloperoxidase system (MPO/H2O2/Cl-). Purified human neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) bound tightly to HA-Sepharose and we suggest that this is due to a strong ionic interaction between HA and MPO. The formation of such a complex did not disturb MPO activity. The significance of these results in relation to our previous studies concerning the reduction in viscosity and potential cleavage of HA by the product of the MPO/H2O2/Cl- system is discussed.\r"

This report evaluates the prevalence of drug use among the respondents, when they initiated drug use, and their reasons for current use. Substance use rates are compared with other studies of resident physicians and with a sample of their nonphysician age peers surveyed the same year. Heavy substance use patterns were not observed among resident physicians. They had significantly lower rates of use for most psychoactive substances than their peers in the general population but did report higher rates of past-month use of alcohol and benzodiazepines. A sizable minority began using benzodiazepines and prescription opiates during their residency years-the stage in physicians' training when they first receive prescribing privileges. Current users of benzodiazepines and opiates used these drugs primarily for self-treatment rather than recreation. These two substances are often associated with impairment at later stages in the physician's career.\r"

Compared with national, age-related comparison groups, senior medical students reported less use of all substances during the past 30 days and the past 12 months, except for alcohol, tranquilizers, and psychedelics other than LSD. Substantial new drug use after entry into medical school was reported only for tranquilizers. Seven students (0.2%) admitted to current dependence on a substance other than tobacco, four of these implicating marijuana. Thirty-three students (1.6%) believed that they currently needed help for substance abuse. Only 25.7% were aware of any policy on substance abuse at their own school.\r"

The prevalence of dyslipidemic hypertension was similar by zygosity but proband concordance was three times greater in monozygotic than dizygotic twins (0.44 [seven concordant and 18 discordant pairs] vs 0.14 [two concordant and 24 discordant pairs]), suggesting a genetic effect on the condition. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was the most common lipid abnormality in concordant pairs. Mortality from ischemic heart disease was significantly higher in individuals with dyslipidemic hypertension. Obesity and glucose intolerance were closely associated with the syndrome. Moreover, within the 18 discordant monozygotic twin pairs, the twins with dyslipidemic hypertension had gained significantly more weight as adults and were significantly heavier than their unaffected cotwins. Thus, although genetic factors may influence development of dyslipidemic hypertension, nongenetic, potentially modifiable aspects of obesity are also closely related to expression of this clinically important syndrome.\r"

The estimates of unsuspected disease should approximate what occurs in the living population. The necropsy records of the University of Kansas Medical Center (Kansas City) from 1950 to 1984 were examined for the occurrence rate of abdominal aortic aneurysms. Each adult patient was categorized as (1) without abdominal aortic aneurysm, (2) abdominal aortic aneurysm discovered as a necropsy surprise, or (3) abdominal aortic aneurysm diagnosed or suspected during life. Necropsy detection rates of unsuspected abdominal aortic aneurysms were compared with those found in five published screening surveys. The necropsy detection rate in men was 81 (0.019) of 4155 and was 28 (0.009) of 3142 in women, a difference that was statistically significant. When the necropsy series was adjusted to reflect the same demographic composition as the screening surveys, the results from necropsy and screening were statistically similar. In particular, two surveys from the United Kingdom showed screening detection rates among white men of 0.072 compared with a necropsy detection rate of 0.058. These results further support the use of the epidemiologic necropsy as a research tool for estimating the reservoir of disease in the population.\r"

One hundred fourteen house officers (45%) completed an anonymous questionnaire describing their most significant mistake and their response to it. Mistakes included errors in diagnosis (33%), prescribing (29%), evaluation (21%), and communication (5%) and procedural complications (11%). Patients had serious adverse outcomes in 90% of the cases, including death in 31% of cases. Only 54% of house officers discussed the mistake with their attending physicians, and only 24% told the patients or families. House officers who accepted responsibility for the mistake and discussed it were more likely to report constructive changes in practice. Residents were less likely to make constructive changes if they attributed the mistake to job overload. They were more likely to report defensive changes if they felt the institution was judgmental. Decreasing the work load and closer supervision may help prevent mistakes. To promote learning, faculty should encourage house officers to accept responsibility and to discuss their mistakes.\r"

Infants 15 to 18 months of age presenting at our well-child clinics for routine examination and immunizations were divided into two groups. Those infants with a history and physical findings of upper respiratory tract infection were compared with healthy control group infants who did not have upper respiratory tract infections, and who did not have a history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms within the previous month. Both groups were studied for their serologic response to measles-mumps-rubella vaccination. Prevaccination serum samples were obtained prior to vaccine administration and postvaccination serum samples were obtained 6 to 8 weeks later. Measles antibody was measured in these serum samples by an indirect fluorescein-tagged antibody test. Ten (21%) of 47 infants with colds failed to develop measles antibody, while only one (2%) of 51 well infants failed to develop antibody. We conclude that infants with colds have a significant seroconversion failure rate associated with measles vaccine administration and that this may be the cause of some primary measles vaccine failures.\r"

  ".W": "Although the safety of the APLD procedure is clearly established both by reports in the published literature and by a consensus of the DATTA panelists, there was no consensus among the DATTA panelists on the effectiveness of the procedure. The average 75% success rate reported in the larger studies contrasts with the 95% success rate reported for laminectomy and diskectomy. For APLD, careful patient selection is essential. Candidates must have failed an adequate trial of conservative therapy (bed rest and limitation of activity) and have disk herniation documented by appropriate imaging studies. These studies are important because they can demonstrate not only the degree of herniation, but also whether it is contained within the annulus and if any free fragments are present. For herniated lumbar disks with nuclear material outside and contiguous with the annulus, a statistically significant consensus of DATTA panelists believed that APLD is an inappropriate procedure. Another study has shown that the procedure can be taught to other surgeons without compromising patient safety, and, as reported, this holds with large numbers of cases. In appropriately selected patients, the clinical trade-off of APLD appears to be between a procedure with a 75% success rate with low risk and rapid recovery vs one with a 95% success rate and a more prolonged recovery. A research question is whether APLD could be extended to patients who have undergone previous surgery whose disks reherniate after a successful laminectomy. Conversely, does an APLD procedure that fails to relieve symptoms complicate subsequent laminectomy? It is recognized that there is a need for prospective, controlled, randomized clinical trials comparing APLD with laminectomy to resolve these and other issues.\r"

Two hundred four women were assigned to a control group after delivery. Continuous labor support significantly reduced the rate of cesarean section deliveries (supported group, 8%; observed group, 13%; and control group, 18%) and forceps deliveries. Epidural anesthesia for spontaneous vaginal deliveries varied across the three groups (supported group, 7.8%; observed group, 22.6%; and control group, 55.3%). Oxytocin use, duration of labor, prolonged infant hospitalization, and maternal fever followed a similar pattern. The beneficial effects of labor support underscore the need for a review of current obstetric practices.\r"

After 24 months the trial of labor and vaginal birth rates in the audit and feedback group were no different from those in the control group, but rates were 46% and 85% higher, respectively, among physicians educated by an opinion leader. Duration of hospital stay was lower in the opinion leader education group than in the other two groups. The overall cesarean section rate was reduced only in the opinion leader education group. There were no adverse clinical outcomes attributable to the interventions. The use of opinion leaders improved the quality of care.\r"

Data are from a 2-year prospective, observational, multisite study of 1030 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and advanced AIDS-related complex who received zidovudine. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developed in 24 (2.3%) of 1030 patients who received zidovudine during 1463 person-years of follow-up (rate, 1.6 per 100 person-years of therapy). The relative hazard for development of NHL was stable throughout 2 years of therapy, with the risk of developing NHL 0.8% for each additional 6 months of therapy. Factors associated with development of NHL were a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, herpes simplex virus infection, or lower mean neutrophil count. Less strongly associated was a prior diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia or homosexual transmission of HIV. By Cox proportional hazards analysis, a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus disease, or oral hairy leukoplakia was most strongly associated with development of NHL. Our study demonstrates a relatively high incidence of NHL in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy and suggests possible risk factors for development of NHL.\r"

These observations raise concerns that the use of such settings for early intervention programs for low-birth-weight infants may increase the already high burden of medical care costs incurred by these children and their families. To address the question of medical care use associated with center-based care, we examined the hospital-based and ambulatory care reported for participants of the Infant Health and Development Program. This project is a multisite randomized trial of an early intervention program for preterm low-birth-weight infants with an intervention including 2 years of center-based care. The Intervention group did not differ in hospital-based care and averaged only two more physicians' visits over the 3-year observation period than the comparison group. We conclude that early intervention programs involving high-quality group care are not accompanied by substantial increases in health care use.\r"

To resolve this paradox, we compared the office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressures of 59 untreated hypertensive smokers with 118 nonsmoking hypertensives matched for age, sex, and race. The office blood pressures of the smoking and nonsmoking groups were 141/93 and 142/93 mm Hg, respectively. The awake ambulatory systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the smokers (145 vs 140 mm Hg). This difference was greater among patients over the age of 50 years (153 vs 142 mmHg), and absent among patients under 50 years (140 vs 139 mm Hg). Blood pressures during sleep did not differ between the two groups (121/76 vs 123/77 mm Hg). We conclude that, among white hypertensives above the age of 50 years, smokers maintain a higher daytime ambulatory systolic blood pressure than nonsmokers even though blood pressure measured in the office is similar.\r"

Patients with thalamic and cortical infarctions had severe impairment of contralateral hand-mediated somatosensory functions in all three categories of somesthetic tasks, although patients with cortical infarction were more impaired on the object recognition task than were patients with thalamic infarction. Patients with extensive damage to the right hemisphere and severe left hemineglect also had impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in the ipsilateral hand despite normal basic and intermediate somatosensory function and visually mediated object recognition analogous to unilateral tactile agnosia.

In one patient who had recurrent torticollis, a second procedure in conjunction with injection of botulinum toxin has produced substantial improvement; however, follow-up was brief (6 months). No surgical complications occurred. We believe that selective peripheral denervation is safe and that it can benefit patients with torticollis who have not responded to other types of therapy. These favorable results confirm other published reports on the efficacy of selective peripheral denervation. Long-term follow-up, however, is necessary for determining the role of this procedure in the management of torticollis.\r"

Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively.

Further testing (24-hour ambulatory or transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring or electrophysiologic study) of the 39 patients with normal EECG findings revealed 8 additional patients with arrhythmias. In group 1, the sensitivity of EECG was 56%, and its negative predictive value was 79%. Group 2 consisted of 38 patients with atrial arrhythmias, 31 with ventricular arrhythmias, and 23 with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities before EECG. Of these 92 patients, 68 (74%) had abnormal EECG findings. All but 1 of the 24 patients with normal findings underwent further testing, and rhythm abnormalities were induced in 16. Patients with atrial arrhythmias were more likely to have normal EECG results (42%) than were those with ventricular arrhythmias (23%) or an atrioventricular conduction abnormality (4%). Of the 35 patients who had been referred for suppression of an arrhythmia, 25 (71%) had abnormal rhythm suppressed during exercise.

Analysis of biopsy features such as epidermal lymphocytic exocytosis, periappendageal infiltrate, and deposition of mucin revealed no predominant finding that distinguished a benign course from mycosis fungoides. A predominance of eosinophils in the infiltrate was suggestive of benign follicular mucinosis rather than mycosis fungoides. Gene rearrangement studies detected three clones in three patients with follicular mucinosis; two were in patients with mycosis fungoides, and one was in a patient with dermatitis.

The pulmonary parenchyma may be assessed for changes of acute lung injury, cardiogenic edema, areas of pneumonitis, atelectasis, or other abnormal collections of fluid or air. In mechanically ventilated patients, barotrauma occurs frequently and may be manifested by subtle intrathoracic collections of air. Technical factors may limit the resolution of the anteroposterior chest radiograph obtained at the bedside, but crucial clinical information is often gained.

  ".W": "For the perioperative management of pregnant patients with severe cardiac or aortic disease who require a cardiac surgical procedure and cardiopulmonary bypass, a close, cohesive, working relationship must exist among several medical and surgical specialties. For appropriate management, the well-being of both the mother and the fetus must be considered. The best interests of the mother and the fetus may not coincide, and optimal therapy for one may be inappropriate for the other. We present 10 cases of severe cardiac or aortic disease in pregnant women who required surgical intervention. Eight patients underwent cardiopulmonary bypass during pregnancy, and two patients had cesarean section performed immediately before cardiopulmonary bypass. We also discuss the pertinent pharmacologic aspects related to the perioperative period and the management of cardiopulmonary bypass for the pregnant patient.\r"

  ".W": "Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with HIV infection. We investigated the epidemiology and aetiology of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma by analysing data from cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, up to June 30, 1989. During this period 97,258 AIDS cases were reported, of whom 2824 (2.9%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The condition was about 60 times more common in AIDS patients than in the general US population. 1686 cases were immunoblastic lymphoma, 548 primary lymphoma of the brain, and 590 Burkitt's lymphoma, a condition which is not normally associated with immunosuppression. The proportion of AIDS patients with immunoblastic lymphoma increased from 0% in those under 1 year old to 3.5% in those aged 50 or more. Primary lymphoma of the brain was constant at 0.6% for all ages. The frequency of Burkitt's lymphoma increased from zero in infants to a peak at 10-19 years of age (1.8%). Each type of lymphoma was twice as common in whites as in blacks and in men as in women. Lymphoma was most common in patients with haemophilia or clotting disorders and least common in those born in the Caribbean or Africa who had acquired HIV by heterosexual contact. Epidemiological data suggested that whilst infectious agents (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) may be associated with development of non-Hodgkin lymphomas in AIDS patients there was probably no single cause for all the types of lymphoma. Perhaps the most puzzling question is why Burkitt's lymphoma is commonly associated with HIV infection but not with other types of immunosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the pathogenesis of acute coronary disorders and to clarify what type of plaque precedes these disorders, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy, by means of a new angioscope, was carried out during catheterisation in 100 consecutive patients anatomically suitable for such investigations. The quality of the angioscopic image was good enough for analysis in 84 patients (14 with acute myocardial infarction [within 8 h of onset], 16 with recent myocardial infarction [3 days-2 months since onset], 24 with old myocardial infarctions, 10 with unstable angina, and 20 with stable angina). Thrombi were observed in most patients with acute coronary disorders (all 14 with acute myocardial infarction, 9 of 10 with unstable angina). Occlusive thrombi were more common in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (11 [79%] vs 1 [10%]; p less than 0.001), whereas mural (non-occlusive) thrombi were more common in the unstable angina than in the acute myocardial infarction group (8 [80%] vs 3 [21%]; p less than 0.001). Xanthomatous ulcerated plaques or ragged irregular surfaces were seen in patients with acute coronary disorders and in those with recent myocardial infarction. Xanthomatous plaques were more common in patients with acute coronary disorders (50%) than in those with stable angina (15%) or old myocardial infarction (8%). By contrast white and smooth plaques were seen in cases of stable angina and old myocardial infarction. Angioscopy could display the intracoronary lumen more precisely than could coronary arteriography. This angioscopic study suggested that, although a thrombus overlying a rupture in the lining of the plaque was common in both unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction, the character of the thrombus may differ between these disorders, and lipid-rich xanthomatous plaque may precede rupture.\r"

During a mean follow-up period of 20 months, all patients became HBsAg negative after transplantation but circulating HBsAg reappeared in 25 (22.7%). Overall 1-year survival was 83.6% and overall 2 year actuarial recurrence of HBsAg was 29% (59% after posthepatitis B cirrhosis, 13% after posthepatitis B-delta cirrhosis, and 0% after fulminant hepatitis B). Patients with HBV cirrhosis who were HBV-DNA positive had a much greater risk of HBsAg recurrence than patients who were HBV-DNA negative (96% vs 29% at 2 years). Reappearance of HBsAg was associated with evidence of HBV replication and abnormal histological findings in the graft. Long-term passive anti-HBV immunoprophylaxis significantly reduced HBV reinfection and improved survival in patients without evidence of active HBV replication before orthotopic liver transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "A non-invasive exercise method was used to look for myocardial damage in apparently normal children who had received moderate doses of anthracyclines for treatment of cancer. 19 children (mean [SD] age 10.6 [4.3] years) who had received anthracyclines (mean total dose 230 [119] mg/m2) and 10 who had received other cytotoxic drugs (mean age 13.3 [4.9] years) were selected from 263 children attending routine follow-up examinations. They underwent measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, and left ventricular dimensions by echocardiography before and after exercise on a bicycle for a maximum of 10 min. All 29 were in remission. All the subjects showed normal fractional shortening (FS = left ventricular end-diastolic minus end-systolic diameter as a percentage of the end-diastolic diameter) at rest, but the increase in FS on exercise was significantly lower in the children who had received anthracyclines than in those who had not (3 [16]% vs 23 [17]%; p less than 0.05). This difference remained significant after adjustment for age and drug exposure. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the adjusted mean percentage changes on exercise in heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Disease type had no effect on the cardiological indices. Thus, many children who have received anthracyclines may have suffered subclinical myocardial damage. Post-exercise echocardiography seems a useful non-invasive method for detecting such damage. Long-term cardiological follow-up of these patients is needed.\r"

There was amplification of all three oncogenes in CIN 3 and invasive cancer compared with normal cervix and CIN 1. The difference was most pronounced with an antibody to the RAS p21 protein, with no overlap between CIN 3 and the normal range. This method might be useful in screening for cervical neoplasia, and for the determination of which CIN lesions require treatment.\r"

In the temazepam group there were no such episodes of memory impairment. Immediate and delayed recall were also tested and related to whether active drug or placebo had been taken the night before. Impairment of delayed recall was significantly and several times greater than that in the temazepam or placebo groups. Next-day memory impairment/amnesia after a bedtime dose of triazolam tended to increase with continued or intermittent drug use. Cognitive impairments associated with triazolam probably represent a spectrum of organic brain dysfunction, with memory impairment/amnesia and confusion being the commonest, and milder manifestations and hallucinations and delusions the more severe and less common, features.\r"

To find out whether the syndrome might be due to rib infarction, 99mTc-diphosphonate bone scans were done. In the eleven episodes thus investigated (10 patients) the scans showed segmental areas of increased radionuclide uptake in ribs, indicative of bone infarction. A possible sequence of events is that the rib infarcts are primary and cause bone pain, followed by soft tissue reaction, pleuritis, and splinting. The resultant hypoventilation leads to atelectasis and subsequent development of the radiographic changes of the acute chest syndrome. Prevention of hypoventilation and treatment of bone pain are important therapeutic goals.\r"
