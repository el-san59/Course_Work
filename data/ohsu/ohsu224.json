Equal stability was seen in maxillary advancement alone and with concomitant mandibular surgery. Eight cases examined individually showed larger than desired postoperative movements. In six of these cases the undesirable postoperative changes were secondary to undesirable preoperative orthodontic flaring of the incisors. The Begg orthodontic technique, because of its tendency to axially rotate teeth, was shown to produce more variability in tooth position than edgewise orthodontics. This study confirms that no preoperative flaring of the maxillary incisors should be attempted; instead, the teeth should be retracted and placed over basal bone with a normal axial inclination. Occlusal correction should then be accomplished by surgery. Suspension wires and bone grafting are sufficient to obtain skeletal stability in cases of maxillary advancement up to 11 mm. In cases where the surgery is more complex, rigid fixation is recommended.\r"

The two drugs were randomly allocated to the patients. The drugs, 0.5 ml, were injected twice into the superior joint compartment of the TMJ with a two-week interval between injections. The effect on subjective symptoms, clinical signs, and bite force was assessed. At the one and two-year follow-ups both the hyaluronate-and the corticosteroid-group had significantly reduced subjective symptoms as well as clinical signs, and the maximum voluntary bite force was significantly increased. The differences in effect between treatments were not statistically significant. It was concluded that both drugs have a significant long-term effect on chronic arthritis of the TMJ and that either of the drugs can be helpful; however, sodium hyaluronate might be the best alternative due to the least risk for side effects.\r"

The relaxations were approximately 43, 100 and 57%, respectively. We did not observe any relaxant effect of paf-acether (4 microM) in tissues contracted with acetylcholine (50 microM). Both lyso paf-acether (10 microM) and bovine serum albumin (25 micrograms/ml) were without effect on histamine-contracted preparations. In the presence of indomethacin (1.7 microM; 30 min) or aspirin (0.1 mM; 30 min) the relaxant effect of paf-acether (4 microM) in tissues contracted with histamine was significantly reduced to approximately 10 and 12%, respectively. When paf-acether (4 microM) was added to histamine-contracted tracheal preparations in the presence of noradrenaline (0.1 microM) or prostaglandin E2 (PGE2, 10 nM) the relaxations were 62 and 82%, respectively. Noradrenaline and PGE2 alone had only a slight relaxant effect in these tissues (7 and 14%, respectively). In the presence of indomethacin (1.7 microM) the synergistic effect of paf-acether and PGE2 was still observed. The basal production of PGE2 in isolated guinea pig tracheal preparations was 4.6 +/- 1.4 pg/mg of tissue. In the presence of paf-acether (4 microM) increased levels of this prostanoid were detected (11.2 +/- 2.4 pg/mg of tissue). Isolated guinea pig tracheal preparations when contracted with histamine released PGE2 (17.6 +/- 4.1 pg/mg of tissue). In the presence of histamine and paf-acether there was a significant increase in detectable levels of PGE2 (48.6 +/- 13.2 pg/mg of tissue).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A significant risk of ANLL was also observed with the use of syntomycin, a drug pharmacologically related to chloramphenicol. The risks remained high when analyses were limited to either first or latest use of these antibiotics more than 2 years before diagnosis.

The t(9;22) (q34;q11) translocation is one of the most consistent and generates the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) (ref. 1) in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML); it has also been observed in some acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) (ref. 2). In CML the breakpoints occur on chromosome 22 in the region designated bcr (ref. 3) and result in the expression of a bcr-abl fusion product of relative molecular mass (MT) 210,000 (210K) with associated in vitro tyrosine kinase activity (P210bcr-abl). In some cases of Ph1-positive ALL, a novel abl-related protein (P190all-abl) of 190K has been shown to have tyrosine kinase activity. In this report we demonstrate that the P190all-abl protein has a bcr determinant from the amino-terminal region, but is lacking a bcr determinant normally found in the P210bcr-abl near the bcr-abl junction. The chimaeric nature of the P190all-abl was confirmed by sequential immunoprecipitation with antisera against abl and bcr peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the aetiologic agent of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) in most countries and probably originated in Central Africa like the AIDS epidemic itself. Evidence for a second major group of human immunodeficiency-associated retroviruses came from a report that West African human populations like wild-caught African green monkeys had serum antibodies that reacted more strongly with a simian immunodeficiency virus (STLV-3Mac) (ref.6) than with HIV-1. Novel T-lymphotropic retroviruses were reported to have been isolated from healthy Senegalese West Africans (HTLV-4) (ref. 4) and from African green monkeys (STLV-3AGM) (ref. 7), and a different retrovirus (HIV-2) was identified in other West African AIDS patients. Genomic analysis of HIV-2 clearly distinguished it from STLV-3 (ref. 9), but restriction enzyme site-mapping of three different HTLV-4 isolates and six different STLV-3AGM isolates showed them to be essentially indistinguishable. In this report we clone, restriction map, and partially sequence three isolates of HTLV-4 (PK82, PK289, PK190) (ref. 4). We find that these viruses differ in nucleotide sequence from each other and from three isolates of STLV-3AGM (K78, K6W, K1) (ref. 7) by 1% or less. We also report the isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from the peripheral blood of a healthy Senegalese woman which hybridizes preferentially to HIV-2 specific DNA probes. We conclude that HTLV-4 (ref. 4) and STLV-3AGM (ref. 7) are not independent virus isolates and that HIV-2 is present in Senegal as it is in other West African countries.\r"

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels at rest were reduced by 22%, but did not fall further during exercise or contracture. The slope of work rate versus inorganic phosphate/phosphocreatine (Pi/PCr) was 42 +/- 8 joules/min/Pi/PCr in three patients without muscle wasting, compared with 13 and 16 in patients with atrophy (normal, 30 to 50 joules/min/Pi/PCr). Recovery from exercise showed similar rates in patients (postischemic exercise 1.03 +/- 0.17, post-aerobic 1.63 +/- 0.17 PCr/Pi units per minute) and controls (1.0 +/- 0.2 and 1.8 +/- 0.2, respectively) independent of intracellular pH. Infusion of glucose improved exercise kinetics by 163 to 190%, but an oral load of protein had no effect. We conclude that (1) muscle mitochondria operate normally in vivo in this glycogenolytic disorder, suggesting a sufficient alternate fuel supply. (2) Blood-borne glucose may serve as one alternate fuel for the \"second wind\" phenomenon. (3) ATP control mechanisms are altered only at rest. (4) Recovery from exercise is relatively pH-independent.\r"

Both procedures may be applied to correct the symmetric or the asymmetric types of bird-face deformity. Both have the elongation in the front area by means of one- or two-step advancement genioplasty in common. The difference between the two procedures lies mainly in the way the elongation of the mandibular body is achieved. Procedure 2 advocates the elongation of the mandible by means of vertical osteotomy within the tooth-bearing area, and procedure 1 advocates the elongation of the mandible behind the tooth-bearing area by means of the extended sagittal split osteotomy. Both procedures are demonstrated by drawings and by cases of patients who have been operated on.\r"

Four animals received only the tritiated estrogen (1 microgram/kgm) and one animal, which served as the control, received both the tritiated estrogen and the unlabeled estrogen (100 micrograms/kgm). The study failed to demonstrate nuclear uptake and retention of tritiated estrogen in any of the tissues of the temporomandibular joint complex, including the articular surface of the condyle, articular disk, capsule, and muscles of mastication. However, estrogen receptors were identified in other tissues, including the pituitary. All tissues examined in the control animal were negative for estrogen receptors. It was concluded that there were no estrogen receptors in the temporomandibular joint complex of aged male baboons. As in previous studies, these findings provide additional evidence of a sexual dimorphism with respect to estrogen receptor distribution in the temporomandibular joint complex of the baboon. Furthermore, it is reasonable to speculate that estrogens may modulate a variety of metabolic functions in these tissues that could be important in the maintenance, repair, and/or pathogenesis of the temporomandibular joint.\r"

In this study, the medication taken by 225 consecutive patients with oral lichen planus was compared with the drug histories of 202 age- and gender-matched control patients who were treated at the same clinics. Fifty-three percent of the patients with lichen planus and 44% of the control patients were taking one or more drugs (p greater than 0.05). However, 17% of the patients with lichen planus were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) compared with 9% of the control patients (p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in the use of antihypertensive, oral hypoglycemic, or psychotropic drugs between the two groups. Almost 30% of the patients with the more severe erosive form of lichen planus were taking NSAID while fewer than 9% of the patients without erosions were taking this type of medication indicating a relationship between NSAID and the more severe form of lichen planus (p less than 0.01). Withdrawal from NSAID resulted in resolution or marked clinical improvement in the 12 patients tested. These results indicate that oral lichen planus may be aggravated or precipitated by NSAID and that withdrawal from the drug may benefit some patients.\r"

Twenty-nine of the subjects had surgery and physical therapy intervention, while 29 had surgery only. Patients referred for physical therapy had more complaints of pain and significantly less incisal opening after surgery than those not referred for physical therapy. Both groups, however, had achieved a comparable amount of incisal opening 6 to 12 months after surgery. Chi square analysis indicated that patients with an incisal opening of less than 30 mm postoperatively were more likely to have an incisal opening of 40 mm 6 to 12 months after surgery if they received physical therapy treatments. Patients having more than 30 mm of incisal opening a month after surgery showed a greater tendency to achieve more than 40 mm of opening if physical therapy was included in the postoperative management.\r"

Results of immunostaining showed that (1) intercalated ducts, myoepithelial cells, and acinous cells of normal salivary glands express HLA-DR antigens, (2) autoimmune salivary gland disease results in greater HLA-DR expression than that seen in nonspecific inflammatory lesions or normal glands, (3) stromal cells associated with benign and malignant salivary gland tumors express HLA-DR antigens, and (4) numerous benign and malignant salivary gland tumors express HLA-DR antigens. It was of interest that lymphocyte-rich Warthin's tumors displayed epithelial immunoreactivity, whereas oncocytomas devoid of a lymphocytic component were invariably negative. This suggests a lymphocyte-mediated role in salivary epithelial HLA-DR expression. It appears that HLA-DR expression is both a normal and an inducible phenomenon in salivary glands, salivary gland neoplasia, and the desmoplastic host response. There is no discriminatory role in the immunologic detection of HLA-DR for differential diagnosis of salivary gland tumors.\r"

Although white and female infants had higher cord blood levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) than did black and male infants, respectively, these differences did not persist throughout early childhood. Mean levels of all serum lipids and lipoproteins increased greatly in the first 6 months of life, and by 2 years of age, levels approached those seen in adolescents. Infants consuming cow's milk had higher 6-month levels of serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol than did formula-fed infants. However, milk source in infancy did not significantly influence total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at age 7 years. Serum lipid and lipoprotein levels at age 7 years were associated with previously measured levels as early as 6 months of age, and infants with unfavorable levels were likely to have similar adverse levels at 7 years of age. In addition, increases in obesity between 6 months and 7 years of age were positively associated with increases in levels of serum triglycerides. These results suggest that certain persons at increased risk for cardiovascular disease can be identified in infancy.\r"

A low serum triiodothyronine (T3) level is commonly noted in starvation states and is caused by reduced peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. Diminished T4 concentrations are also observed. Adequate nutrition normalizes this type of aberrant laboratory profile. Thyroid function tests that give results below the normal range are best repeated initially for verification of results and again after adequate nutrition is reestablished. If no primary endocrinopathy is present, spontaneous correction of these laboratory values can be expected with conventional dietary habits.\r"

However, there are local regions of sequence similarity with alpha transducin, including the sites subject to ADP-ribosylation by Bordetella pertussis and cholera toxins and the phosphoryl binding-sites. Secondary structure prediction and circular dichroic spectroscopy show that S antigen is composed predominantly of beta-sheet conformation.

Assays of the quenching of acridine orange fluorescence showed that addition of both ATP and valinomycin to K+-loaded proteoliposomes led to the formation of a pH gradient that was acidic inside. ATP-driven acidification took place in the absence of permeant anions and was inhibited by the \"protonophore\", carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone, indicating that only H+ was transported actively. Proton translocation was readily blocked by N-ethylmaleimide (10 microM gave 50% inhibition of fluorescence quenching) but was unaffected by oligomycin (50 nM), orthovanadate (50 microM), or ouabain (0.5 mM); similarly, only N-ethylmaleimide affected ATP hydrolysis by proteoliposomes (88% inhibition). Other work showed that reconstitution of ATP-driven proton translocation required the presence of glycerol during protein solubilization and that optimal recovery depended on the use of both glycerol and phospholipid at this stage. We conclude that acidification of the lysosome is mediated by an ATPase capable of electrogenic H+ translocation without molecular coupling to other ionic species.\r"

Southern blot analyses with beta 2AR-specific probes show that a single beta 2AR gene is common to various human tissues and that its flanking sequences are highly conserved among humans and between man and rabbit, mouse, and hamster. Functional significance of these regions is supported by the presence of a promoter region (including mRNA cap sites, two \"TATA boxes,\" a \"CAAT box,\" and three G + C-rich regions that resemble binding sites for transcription factor Sp1) 200-300 base pairs 5' to the translation initiation codon.

The GIP moiety is flanked by polypeptide segments of 51 and 60 amino acids at its NH2 and COOH termini, respectively. The former includes a signal peptide of about 21 residues and an NH2-terminal propeptide of 30 amino acids. GIP is released from the precursor by processing at single arginine residues.

  ".W": "Selective condensation of the unprotected fragments of alpha-globin--namely, alpha 1-30 and alpha 31-141--is catalyzed by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease in the presence of 25% 1-propanol. The propensity of 1-propanol to induce the alpha-helical conformation and to generate a \"native-like\" topology for the polypeptide chain has been now investigated in an attempt to understand the molecular basis of this enzyme-catalyzed stereospecific condensation. Removal of heme from the alpha-chain decreases the overall alpha-helical conformation of the protein considerably. A significant amount of the alpha-helical conformation is restored in the presence of 25% 1-propanol and the digestion of alpha-globin by V8 protease becomes more selective concomitant with the increase in helicity. V8 protease digestion of alpha-globin at pH 6.0 and 4 degrees C occurs at Glu-30, Asp-47, Glu-27, and Glu-23 in the absence of 1-propanol. In the presence of 25% 1-propanol, the digestion is selective to the peptide bond of Glu-30. This selectivity appears to be a characteristic feature of the native conformation of alpha-chain (polypeptide chain with bound heme). 1-Propanol induces the alpha-helical conformation into RNase S peptide also. However, this increased helical conformation did not protect the RNase S peptide from V8 protease digestion at the Glu-9-Arg-10 peptide bond. RNase S peptide is an alpha-helical conformation in RNase S, an interacting fragment-complementing system of S protein and S peptide. S peptide is resistant to V8 protease hydrolysis in this conformation. Thus, the resistance of a peptide bond in a segment of a protein to protease digestion appears to be a consequence of the secondary structure as well as the tertiary interactions of this segment with the rest of the molecule. The results suggest that the 1-propanol induces alpha-helical conformation into segments of alpha-globin as well as packing of these helices in a native-like topology.\r"

We describe conditions under which the resistance to the rotational motion of the transcription ensemble around the DNA can be large. In such cases, the advancing polymerase generates positive supercoils in the DNA template ahead of it and negative supercoils behind it. Mutual annihilation of the positively and negatively supercoiled regions may be prevented by anchoring points on the DNA to a large structure, or, in the case of an unanchored plasmid, by the presence of two oppositely oriented transcription units. In prokaryotes, DNA topoisomerase I preferentially removes negative supercoils and DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) removes positive ones. Our model thus provides an explanation for the experimentally observed high degree of negative or positive supercoiling of intracellular pBR322 DNA when DNA topoisomerase I or gyrase is respectively inhibited. We discuss the implications of our model in terms of supercoiling regulation, DNA conformational transitions, and gene regulation in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\r"

Therefore, a full-length cDNA encoding human liver-type ALP was used as a probe to isolate the mouse placental ALP cDNA. The cloned mouse cDNA is 2459 base pairs long and is composed of an open reading frame encoding a 524-amino acid polypeptide that contains a putative signal peptide of 17 amino acids. Homology at the amino acid level of the mouse placental ALP is 90% to the human liver isozyme but only 55% to the human placental counterpart. RNA blot hybridization results indicate that the mouse placental ALP is encoded by a gene identical to the gene expressed in mouse liver, kidney, and teratocarcinoma stem cells.

The beta-globin gene is not expressed in yolk sac-derived erythroid cells in early embryonic development but is expressed concomitantly with the adult mouse beta-globin genes in 14- to 16-day fetal liver and adult reticulocytes. In an attempt to localize sequences that direct erythroid-specific expression, fragments of the human beta-globin gene were inserted in the opposite orientation 200 base pairs (bp) upstream of an intact human A gamma marker gene, which is not expressed on its own in mouse fetal liver. In the experiments reported here, two beta-globin 3' sequences activated the marker gene specifically in fetal liver. One sequence is located in a 250-bp Pst I fragment 550-800 bp downstream from the poly(A) site; the other is located near an EcoRI site in the third exon. These two sequences are active individually, and their combined effect is greater than their effects alone. beta-Globin 5' sequences from -815 to -50 were also analyzed for activity in this assay. The 5' sequences did not activate the marker gene when tested alone but did stimulate expression that was already directed to adult erythroid tissue by the two 3' sequences. These results suggest that three separate sequences are involved in human beta-globin gene regulation. The two 3' sequences act as adult erythroid enhancers and the 5' sequence stimulates expression that is already determined to be erythroid specific.\r"

The dilute and concentrated branches of the coexistence curve were characterized, consistently, both by measurements of the two coexisting concentrations, c(T), and by measuring the cloud temperatures for various initial concentrations. We estimate that the critical concentration, cc, is 244 mg of protein per ml solution. The coexistence curve is well represented by the absolute value of (c - cc)/cc = 5.2 square root (Tc - T)/Tc. Using the temperature dependence of the scattered light intensity along isochores parallel to the critical isochore, we estimated the location of the spinodal line and found it to have the form (c - cc)/cc = 3.0 square root (Tc - T)/Tc. The ratio of the widths of the coexistence curve and the spinodal line, (5.2/3.0), is close to the mean-field value square root 3. We have also observed the growth of large crystals of gamma II-crystallin in some of these aqueous solutions and have made preliminary observations as to the factors that promote or delay the onset of crystallization. These findings suggest that selected protein/water systems can serve as excellent model systems for the study of phase transitions and critical phenomena.\r"

The distribution of these free energies among the partially ligated species is incompatible with a two-state mechanism of molecular switching and requires a minimum of three molecular structures with distinctly different free energies of heme-heme interaction. Ligand-linked transitions between the three cooperativity states were found to be \"combinatorial\"--i.e., dependent upon changes in both the number and specific configuration of bound ligands. Here we present results from two other chemical systems that mimic intermediate oxygenation states. In these systems the heme iron is replaced by manganese in certain of the subunits. We find the same distribution of cooperative free energies as reported for the cyanomethemoglobin system. These results demonstrate that the three-state combinatorial nature of cooperative switching is neither a special feature of the cyanomet reactions nor of the substitution of manganese for iron, but reflects a fundamental property of hemoglobin. These findings are compared with crystallographic structural results on partially ligated hemoglobins.\r"

  ".W": "The conventional alternating access model for Ca2+ transport by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump is modified, partly on the basis of the proposed MacLennan-Green domain structure for the Ca2+-pump protein. The present model divides the uptake state (E1) of the protein into three substates, differing in the condition of the Ca2+-binding domain. The domain is an open cavity in the first substate and can bind only a single Ca2+ ion. A fast \"jaw-closing\" (or \"hinge-bending\") step then partially closes the cavity to generate the second substate that has a second Ca2+-binding site. Occupation of this site is followed by another jaw-closing step that closes the binding cavity and occludes the bound ions. The subsequent translocation step (to form E2) remains unchanged from previous models. The modified model predicts a constant transport stoichiometry of two Ca2+ per pump reaction cycle. It suggests a plausible mechanism for coupling between Ca2+ binding and ATP utilization: the model predicts (in agreement with experiment) that Ca2+ binding should be a mandatory requirement for phosphorylation of the pump protein, though ATP binding per se does not require Ca2+. The model is consistent with high cooperativity in equilibrium binding of Ca2+, both in the absence and presence of ATP.\r"

  ".W": "The tomato gene family for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase [3-phospho-D-glycerate carboxy-lyase (dimerizing); EC 4.1.1.39] has five genes, designated Rbcs-1, -2, -3A, -3B, and -3C. We have measured the steady-state mRNA levels for each of the five genes in various tomato organs using gene-specific oligonucleotides. All five genes are highly expressed in leaves, and transcripts of two genes, Rbcs-3B and Rbcs-3C, account for approximately equal to 60% of the total leaf transcripts. The relative transcript levels in the stem, in nature fruits, and etiolated seedlings (plants germinated and grown in the dark) correspond to 3.2%, 6.5%, and 4.6%, respectively, of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit mRNA level in leaves, and no transcripts have been detected in roots and ripe tomato fruits. Only Rbcs-1 and Rbcs-2 are expressed during the photosynthetically active phase of fruit development. Transcripts from these genes and from the Rbcs-3A locus are also present in etiolated seedlings. Rbcs-3B and Rbcs-3C transcripts, which are the most abundant mRNAs of the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit gene family in the leaf, are undetectable in dark-grown seedlings and immature fruit. The selective expression of Rbcs-1 and Rbcs-2 in the dark and in the pericarp of green fruit and the induction and rapid mRNA accumulation for Rbcs-3B and Rbcs-3C after illumination may reflect different regulatory mechanism(s) that control the expression of individual members in the tomato ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit gene family.\r"

A region of the heavy chain of GPIIb, defined by the monoclonal antibody PMI-1, is involved in adhesion receptor function. We have localized and chemically synthesized this region of GPIIb. A cDNA clone that directs the synthesis of a fusion protein reactive with the PMI-1 antibody was isolated from a phage lambda gt11 expression library constructed with mRNA from an erythroleukemia (HEL) cell line. The deduced amino acid sequence of this clone indicates that it spans the light-heavy chain junction of GPIIb and contains a portion of the carboxyl terminus of the heavy chain and the amino terminus of the light chain. The PMI-1 epitope was found to be contained within a 9-kDa staphylococcal V8 protease fragment of GPIIb, and such a fragment was predicted within the putative heavy-chain sequence. A computerized antigen prediction program identified a single sequence with a high probability of containing a continuous epitope. A synthetic 17-residue peptide containing this sequence binds PMI-1 and inhibits PMI-1 binding to GPIIb-IIIa. The peptide-antibody complex has an approximate Kd of 1.2 microM, which compares to a Kd of 0.95 microM for PMI-1 binding to GPIIb. The region containing the PMI-1 epitope shows no similarity to corresponding regions of two other adhesion receptors, indicating that this portion of GPIIb may function in activities unique to the platelet receptor.\r"

  ".W": "The kinetics of acidification of diferric human transferrin in BALB/c mouse 3T3 cells were determined by flow cytometry using a modification of the fluorescein-rhodamine fluorescence ratio technique. For cells labeled at 0 degrees C and warmed to 37 degrees C, the minimum pH observed was 6.1 +/- 0.2, occurring 5 min after warmup. This step was followed by a slower alkalinization to the pH of the external medium, occurring with a half-time of 5 min. Warmup to 24 degrees C or 17 degrees C resulted in slowing of the time of onset of acidification such that the minimum pH was 6.3 +/- 0.2, attained 15 and 25 min after warmup, respectively; the alkalinization step was completely blocked. The limited acidification observed for transferrin corresponds to the initial phase of acidification normally observed for other (nonrecycled) ligands. Since transferrin is not further acidified, the results confirm the existence of two phases of acidification during endocytosis. Measurements of transferrin dissociation at neutral pH after exposure to mildly acidic pH support the conclusion that the transferrin cycle may be completed without exposure of transferrin to a pH below 6. The mildly acidic pH of the endocytic compartments involved in recycling may play a role in regulating enzymatic processing of endocytosed material.\r"

Class I heparin-binding growth factor (HBGF-I) is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for human endothelial cells in vitro and will induce angiogenesis in vivo. RNA gel blot hybridization experiments demonstrate that cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, but not human umbilical vein endothelial cells, express HBGF-I mRNA. Smooth muscle cells also synthesize an HBGF-I-like polypeptide since (i) extract prepared from smooth muscle cells will compete with 125I-labeled HBGF-I for binding to the HBGF-I cell surface receptor, and (ii) the competing ligand is eluted from heparin-Sepharose affinity resin at a NaCl concentration similar to that required by purified bovine brain HBGF-I and stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, like endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells possess cell-surface-associated HBGF-I receptors and respond to HBGF-I as a mitogen. These results indicate the potential for an additional autocrine component of vascular smooth muscle cell growth control and establish a vessel wall source of HBGF-I for endothelial cell division in vivo.\r"

Nuclear magnetic resonance studies with [1-13C]glucose showed that the other products released were succinate, acetate, alanine, pyruvate, and lactate. Under anaerobic conditions, lactate output increased, glycerol became a major product, and, surprisingly, glucose consumption decreased. Enzymatic assays showed that the lactate formed was D(-)-lactate. The release of alanine during incubation with glucose as the sole carbon source suggested that appreciable proteolysis occurred, consistent with our observation that a large amount of ammonia was released under these conditions. The discoveries that D-lactate is a product of L. braziliensis glucose catabolism, that glycerol is produced under anaerobic conditions, and that the cells exhibit a \"reverse\" Pasteur effect open the way for detailed studies of the pathways of glucose metabolism and their regulation in this organism.\r"

The steady-state level of band 3 mRNA increases markedly following dimethyl sulfoxide-induced differentiation, but the pattern of transcription initiation does not vary. mRNA from anemic and normal mouse spleen exhibits the same pattern, with the addition of another transcript whose 5' end maps to position -260. In contrast, mRNA from mouse kidney has a single predominant transcript, mapping to -260. These data establish that the band 3 gene is expressed in kidney as well as in erythroid cells and suggest the presence of tissue-specific alternate promoter elements within the first exon of the band 3 gene. The nucleotide sequence of 1.7 kilobases of genomic DNA 5' to the first intron of the single-copy mouse band 3 gene, although moderately (G + C)-rich, has no \"TATA\" or \"CAAT\" boxes or other homologies with globin or other eukaryotic polymerase II promoter regions.\r"

After saturating cells with fluoresceinated methotrexate, we examined the ability of hydrophilic and lipophilic antifolates to displace fluoresceinated methotrexate binding to dihydrofolate reductase. Cells with methotrexate transport deficiency are unable to take up methotrexate and thus retain the fluorescence, whereas the lipophilic antifolates displace fluoresceinated methotrexate equally well in sensitive and resistant cell lines. These resistant clones fail to take up methotrexate and occur with high frequencies upon single-step selections at methotrexate concentrations approximately equal to 7-fold the 50% killing concentration. The majority of such first-step resistant clones appear to derive their resistance solely from transport deficiency; they exhibit no overproduction of dihydrofolate reductase and no increase in either steady-state mRNA levels or gene copy number. Possible applications of the use of fluoresceinated methotrexate to the characterization of various mechanisms of methotrexate resistance in mixed cell populations are discussed.\r"

Stability conditions for the genetically monomorphic corner equilibria are obtained. In a specialization of this general model, one locus controls the transmission and the other controls the reception of adaptive information. The corner and edge equilibria of this doubly coevolutionary model are fully analyzed, and conditions for transmission and reception to coevolve are derived in terms of the efficiency of vertical transmission, the selective advantage gained from possessing the information, the costs of transmission and reception, and the recombination fraction between the two loci. Possible applications of the model are to the evolution of semantic alarm calls in vervet monkeys and the phonetic aspects of human language. In a third model with diploid genetics, we consider the initial increase of cultural transmission from a mutation-selection balance in which the adaptive phenotype is the consequence of a dominant gene at one locus. A second gene controls the transmission of the phenotype in such a way that a new mutant at this second locus permits learning of the adaptive phenotype from a parent who has it. This new mutant cannot increase when rare.\r"

Two other positions of alternative splicing have been reported previously (ED and IIICS). The third region involves a 273-nucleotide exon encoding exactly one 91-amino acid repeat of type III homology, located between the DNA- and the cell-binding domains of FN, which is either included in or excluded from FN mRNA. The two mRNA variants arising by an exon-skipping mechanism are present in cells known to synthesize the cellular form of FN. However, liver cells, which are the source of plasma FN, produce only messengers without the extra type III sequence. Therefore, the region described here resembles, both structurally and functionally, the previously described ED (for extra domain) region, located toward the C terminus of the molecule, between the cell- and heparin- (hep 2) binding domains. We conclude that both the extra type III repeat (named EDII) and ED represent sequences restricted to cellular FN. Combination of all the possible patterns of splicing in the three regions described to date may generate up to 20 distinct FN polypeptides from a single gene.\r"

Duplication boundaries are nonrandomly distributed, and most appear to align with tRNA genes, suggesting that these may play a role in the duplication process. Duplications are infrequent and usually restricted to particular individuals or populations. They appear to be ephemeral; in no case is the same duplication shared by mitochondrial DNAs from closely related species. Mitochondrial DNA duplications occur significantly more often in triploid than diploid lizards and at similar frequencies in hybrids and nonhybrids.\r"

Recombination frequencies were shown to be 7-fold higher in this region in male meiosis than in female meiosis. Three-point crosses indicated the occurrence in male meiosis of double recombination events in the pseudoautosomal region, with little or no crossover interference, which is in marked contrast to observations made on the similar region of the human sex chromosomes.

Recent evidence shows that POMC products are also normally present in a variety of nonpituitary tissues. To investigate this phenomenon in humans we looked for the presence and characteristics of POMC transcripts in various adult tissues. Blot hybridization analysis of normal adrenal, thymus, and testis RNAs revealed a small RNA species approximately 400 nucleotides shorter than the 1200-nucleotide pituitary species. Primer extension and S1 nuclease mapping studies showed that this small RNA lacked exon 1 and exon 2 of the gene, and it corresponded to a set of at least six molecules starting 41 to 162 nucleotides downstream from the 5' end of exon 3. These RNAs appear to result from heterogeneous transcription initiation sites presumably under the control of \"GC box\" promoter sequences located in the 3' end of intron 2. They cannot encode a complete POMC molecule, and the only truncated POMC molecules that could be translated would lack a signal peptide necessary for membrane translocation and precursor processing. The use of highly sensitive S1 nuclease mapping techniques with uniformly labeled single-stranded DNA probes allowed the detection of a small but definite amount of the \"normal,\" 1200-nucleotide, mRNA species. It is suggested that it is this POMC mRNA that is responsible for the local production of all the POMC peptides.\r"

In this model, IDV infects CD4+ (helper) T cells and is actively synthesized by the immunologically activated helper T cells. Infected helper T cells synthesizing IDV express antigenic determinants specific for IDV and trigger a cellular immune response against themselves that is mediated by cytotoxic T cells and cytotoxic macrophages. The dynamic evolution of the model in the case of mixed-type infections with IDV and with another pathogen that evokes a cell-mediated immune response shows strong interactions between both simultaneous infections. The model might be of value to elucidate the dynamics leading to opportunistic infections. Furthermore, a pivotal role for immunological stimulation in the progressive exacerbation of the disease can be demonstrated.\r"

We have characterized further the properties of this recently described hemoglobin and have demonstrated its utility as a blood substitute. The oxygen transport characteristics of the cross-linked derivative are very similar to those of whole blood. Under physiological conditions, the partial pressure of oxygen at half-saturation of hemoglobin is increased to 29 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 133.3 kPa), compared to 12 mm Hg for hemoglobin A, fully compensating for the absence of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate outside of the erythrocyte. The Hill coefficient is 2.9. The dependence of the oxygen affinity of HbXL99 alpha on CO2 is also identical to that of hemoglobin A. The cross-link between the alpha subunits blocks dissociation of oxyhemoglobin into alpha beta dimers and thereby prevents renal excretion of the modified hemoglobin. In the rat, the half-life of HbXL99 alpha in plasma, at a 15% volume exchange, is increased to 3.3 hr, compared to 90 min for hemoglobin A. Cross-linking HbXL99 alpha intermolecularly with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate to form predominantly a mixture of dimers and trimers further increased the half-life of the hemoglobin within the circulation by about 2-fold. The rate of autooxidation of the transfused hemoglobin was found to be markedly reduced because of the presence of an endogenous reducing system in plasma.\r"

One of the minor fractions (E), which contained about 5% of the total cell number, appeared to contain the stem cells, on the basis of the following criteria: (i) its ability to reproduce the other cellular subpopulations, (ii) its high rate of growth and DNA synthesis, and (iii) the inability of the other subpopulations to generate it. The most differentiated subpopulation appeared to be the densest one (F), since it was the slowest growing and appeared to be the end point of the other subpopulations.\r"

A 32P-labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) probe was used on cryostat sections of 13 formaldehyde-fixed cortical biopsy specimens. Hybridization to NPY mRNA was found in all samples: after autoradiography, discrete deposits of silver granules were observed on neuronal cell bodies abundantly distributed in the deep layers of the cortex, particularly laminae IV and VI, and on smaller cell bodies in the white matter. The localization of the neurons hybridized for NPY mRNA was comparable to that of NPY-immunoreactive cells as shown in sections from the same tissue blocks immunostained by using NPY antibodies. The specificity of the in situ hybridization technique was confirmed by blot hybridization analysis of electrophoretically fractionated RNA. This study clearly demonstrated the consistent localization of NPY gene transcription and expression in normal mature human cortical neurons.\r"

In the retina, exogenously applied dopamine alters the conductance of gap junctions between cultured horizontal cells and this effect is mediated by cyclic AMP. However, it is not known how cyclic AMP modulates horizontal cell gap junction function. Here I report that cyclic AMP works by way of a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase injected into coupled horizontal cells from white bass (Roccus chrysops) rapidly and reversibly uncoupled the cells, mimicking the actions of dopamine. The threshold for the effect was between 0.06 and 0.03 microM. Injection of Walsh inhibitor of protein kinase [Walsh, D. A., Ashby, C. D., Gonzalez, C., Calkins, D., Fischer, E. H. & Krebs, E. G. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1977-1985] blocked the effect of dopamine. Thus, the action of dopamine is to raise intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, which then activates a cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Although not tested, it is likely that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates a protein, possibly a gap junction protein, to alter conductance.\r"

One of the members of the postsynaptic dyad may return conventional feedback synapses onto the bipolar endings. Freeze-fracturing demonstrates that, opposite the presynaptic active zone, both postsynaptic membranes contain an aggregate of intramembrane particles that remain associated with the outer leaflet (E face) of the fractured plasmalemma; this is a feature typical of excitatory synapses in the central nervous system. Intracellular recordings followed by injection of horseradish peroxidase showed that at the dyad synapse the endings of rod bipolar cells are usually presynaptic to the dendrites of two amacrine cells, one narrow-field and bistratified (AII) and the other wide-field (A17). Only the A17 rod amacrine cell returns feedback synapses onto the bipolar endings. Both amacrine cells respond to illumination with transient-sustained depolarizations, dominated by rods; thus, the polarity of their light responses is the same as that of rod bipolar cells. We conclude that the dyad synapses established by rod bipolar cells with the two types of amacrine cells are excitatory.\r"

We have been able to isolate and culture neurons from the mesencephalon according to their expression of NSP4, using the anti-NSP4 immunoreaction in conjunction with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Cultures of NSP4+-sorted cells showed a significant enrichment in three morphologically distinct putative dopaminergic phenotypes when compared to unsorted mesencephalic cultures, whereas the cultures of NSP4--sorted cells were virtually devoid of dopaminergic neurons. This flow cytometric enrichment in dopaminergic neurons should provide the necessary cells for multidisciplinary study of dopaminergic phenotype differentiation.\r"

Lesions of the fimbria and of the septum caused disappearance of a major population of these binding sites, suggesting that a large proportion of them is localized on cholinergic nerve terminals of septal afferents. As a functional correlate to these putative galanin receptor sites, it was shown, both in vivo and in vitro, that galanin, in a concentration-dependent manner, inhibited the evoked release of acetylcholine in the ventral, but not in the dorsal, hippocampus. Intracerebroventricularly applied galanin (10 micrograms/15 microliters) fully inhibited the scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.)-stimulated release of acetylcholine in the ventral, but not in the dorsal, hippocampus, as measured by microdialysis technique. In vitro, galanin inhibited the 25 mM K+-evoked release of [3H]acetylcholine from slices of the ventral hippocampus, with an IC50 value of approximately 50 nM. These results are discussed with respect to the colocalization of galanin- and choline acetyltransferase-like immunoreactivity in septal somata projecting to the hippocampus.\r"

We measured covert shifts of visual attention in three patients with unilateral thalamic hemorrhages shortly after the lesion and after a 6-month recovery period. The experiment measured reaction time to targets that occurred at locations to which attention had been cued (valid trials) or at a currently unattended location (invalid trials). Although the patients showed no deficits in visual fields with perimetry and no neglect in the 6-month follow-up, we found slow reaction times for targets on the side contralateral to the lesion whether or not attention had been cued to that location. Deficits have also been found in this task with cortical and midbrain lesions, but the patterns of performance are quite different. The results with thalamic patients suggest they have a specific deficit in the ability to use attention to improve the efficiency of processing visual targets contralateral to the lesion (engage operation). This finding is in accord with hypotheses of a thalamic link between cortical visual attention and pattern recognition systems proposed by Crick.\r"

The experiment reported here demonstrated that humans use a hybrid algorithm that makes use of both kinds of processes simultaneously and interactively. This conclusion follows from the patterns of response times observed when humans tried to recognize degraded polygons. By blurring the edges, the edge-detection process was selectively impaired, and by imposing noise over the figure and background, the region-growing process was selectively impaired. By varying the amounts of both sorts of degradation independently, the interaction between the two processes was observed.\r"

A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the ATPase activity as a function of GSSG concentration was biphasic and gave apparent Km values of 0.13 mM and 2.0 mM. These kinetics are similar to those reported for the ATP-requiring GSSG-transport systems in human erythrocytes and for the GSSG-stimulated ATPase activity in the plasma membranes of rat hepatocytes. Erythrocyte membranes that were depleted of extrinsic proteins were solubilized in 0.5% Triton X-100. Affinity chromatography on S-hexylglutathione-Sepharose 6B, with elution by a linear gradient of S-hexyl-glutathione, resulted in the resolution of two peaks of enzyme activity. One enzyme, which was eluted at approximately 0.5 mM S-hexylglutathione, had a high affinity for GSSG (apparent Km of 150 microM) and for ATP (80 microM). The other enzyme, which was eluted at approximately 1 mM S-hexylglutathione, had a low affinity for GSSG (apparent Km of 2.0 mM) and ATP (140 microM). GSSG-independent Mg2+-ATPase, Ca2+-dependent Mg2+-ATPase and Na+, K+-dependent Mg2+-ATPase were undetectable in the fractions. Addition of Ca2+, ouabain, or vanadate neither activated nor inhibited the activities, further indicating that the enzymes are distinguishable from ion-pumping ATPases. The enzymes required GSSG for activation; reduced glutathione (GSH) was ineffective. The ATPase activity of the high-Km enzyme was inhibited by addition of p-chloromercuribenzoate, N-ethylmaleimide, and iodoacetamide and was activated by treatment with dithiothreitol, whereas the ATPase activity of the low-Km enzyme was not modified by these thiol reagents. The properties of the enzymes are similar to those of ATP-dependent GSSG-transport systems in human erythrocytes, suggesting that these ATPases may function in the active transport of GSSG.\r"

We propose that such 3'-terminal tRNA-like structures are in fact molecular fossils of the original RNA world, where they tagged genomic RNA molecules for replication and also functioned as primitive telomeres to ensure that 3'-terminal nucleotides were not lost during replication. This picture suggests that the CCA-adding activity was originally an RNA enzyme, that modern DNA telomeres with the repetitive structure CmAn are the direct descendants of the CCA terminus of tRNA, and that the precursor of the modern enzyme RNase P evolved to convert genomic into functional RNA molecules by removing this 3'-terminal tRNA-like tag. Because early RNA replicases would have been catalytic RNA molecules that used the 3'-terminal tRNA-like tag as a template for the initiation of RNA synthesis, these tRNA-like structures could have been specifically aminoacylated with an amino acid by an aberrant activity of the replicase. We show that it is mechanistically reasonable to suppose that this aminoacylation occurred by the same sequence of reactions found in protein synthesis today. The advent of such tRNA synthases would thus have provided a pathway for the evolution of modern protein synthesis.\r"

The first two proalbumins are identical to previously described proalbumins of the Christchurch and Lille types, respectively, and exhibit the characteristic properties of susceptibility to tryptic cleavage and of lower metal-binding affinity. Takefu is a third type of proalbumin and resists tryptic cleavage because of the substitution Arg-1----Pro. Each of the first two types of proalbumins has been identified in geographically separate, ethnically diverse populations and therefore must have arisen by independent mutations. There is some tendency for mutations in albumin to cluster in the propeptide sequence. Although the substitution His3----Gln in the genetic variant albumin Nagasaki-3 decreases metal-binding affinity, mutations further down the polypeptide chain have no such effect, nor is there any reduction of copper-binding affinity in albumin from patients with Wilson disease.\r"

In this paper, we show that the subunits oligomerize into an assembled holotoxin within the periplasm prior to their secretion across the outer membrane. The rate of toxin assembly was studied by pulse-labeling cells with [35S]-methionine and then monitoring the turnover of radiolabeled subunits as they assembled within the periplasm. The subunits entered the periplasm as monomers and assembled into oligomers with a half-time of approximately 1 min. Since assembly was a rapid event compared to the rate of toxin efflux from the periplasm, which had a half-time of approximately 13 min, we conclude that all of the subunits that pass through the periplasm assemble before they traverse the outer membrane. The average concentration of subunit monomers and assembled holotoxin within the periplasm was calculated to be approximately 20 and approximately 260 micrograms/ml, respectively. This indicates that the periplasm is a suitably concentrated milieu where spontaneous toxin assembly can occur. Our findings suggest that protein movement across bacterial outer membranes, in apparent contrast to export across other biological membranes, involves translocation of polypeptides that have already folded into tertiary and even quaternary conformations.\r"

  ".W": "Ferritin stores iron within a protein shell consisting of 24 subunits of two types, heavy (H) and light (L). According to Southern blotting, the rat genome contains four copies homologous to the H-subunit cDNA (H cDNA). To determine whether only one of these is expressed, H cDNAs isolated from rat liver and heart mRNAs were compared and found to share identical nucleotide sequences. Next, genomic clones for three of the four rat H-subunit loci were isolated. Two were classical processed pseudogenes, whereas the third contained an expressed gene. RNase intron mapping of this expressed gene generated the same exon protection pattern when total RNA from rat liver or heart was used, indicating that this gene accounts for most or all of the H-subunit mRNAs (H mRNAs) in these tissues. Comparison of the expressed rat H-subunit gene (H gene) structure with published sequences for other species displays considerable conservation. The coding sequence of the rat H gene predicts 95% similarity to the human amino acid sequence, thus being more highly conserved than the L-subunit sequence of these species. Near the cap region of the 5' untranslated region, the rat H mRNA displays a 28-nucleotide sequence that is almost totally conserved in the corresponding region of the human, bullfrog, and chicken H mRNA and is also faithfully represented in the rat and human L-subunit mRNAs (L mRNAs), thus making this sequence a prime candidate for involvement in the known translational regulation of both subunits by iron. In the 5' flanking region, partially conserved sequences common to H gene and L-subunit gene (L gene) of the rat may be involved in transcriptional regulation by iron, whereas those conserved only in the H gene of man and the rat imply that other factors may independently control H-subunit regulation.\r"

The beta-lyase and the pyridoxal model system converted CTFC to chlorofluoroacetic acid and inorganic fluoride, which were identified by 19F NMR spectrometry. 2-Chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethanethiol and chlorofluorothionoacetyl fluoride were formed as metabolites of CTFC and were trapped with benzyl bromide and diethylamine, respectively, to yield benzyl 2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl sulfide and N,N-diethyl chlorofluorothioacetamide, which were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The bioactivation mechanism of CTFC therefore involves the initial formation of the unstable thiol 2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethanethiol, which loses hydrogen fluoride to form the acylating agent chlorofluorothionoacetyl fluoride; hydrolysis of the thionoacyl fluoride affords the stable, terminal metabolites chlorofluoroacetic acid and inorganic fluoride. The intermediate acylating agent and chlorofluoroacetic acid may contribute to the cytotoxic effects of CTFC.\r"

  ".W": "The DNA sequence corresponding to the estradiol response element has been synthesized and tested in vitro for the binding of specific proteins. Gel retardation experiments combined with dimethyl sulfate protection experiments revealed that this region binds two nonhistone proteins (NHPs). One of them, NHP-1, has a molecular weight of 70,000 and binds specifically to the dyad symmetry sequence GGTCAGCGTGACC. The NHP-1 can be separated from the estradiol receptor chromatographically; it does not bind estradiol and does not cross-react with an antibody directed against the estradiol receptor. A series of synthetic \"mutant\" oligonucleotides were tested in a protein-DNA binding competition assay. Deletion of the GCG in the center of the dyad symmetry sequence suppressed the binding of NHP-1 by 90%, and the conversion of any GC pair to an AT pair decreased the affinity of the binding site for NHP-1. Methylation of the two CpGs on both strands of the dyad symmetry sequence decreased the affinity of the binding site for NHP-1 by 60%, whereas hemimethylation of the same structure did not inhibit the binding of NHP-1. NHP-1 and NHP-2, the NHP binding to the DNA next to the dyad symmetry sequence, bind exclusively to double-stranded DNA. NHP-2 has a molecular weight of 60,000. NHP-1 and NHP-2 are neither tissue nor species specific. In vitro reconstitution experiments show that NHP-1 and NHP-2 increase the binding efficiency of the estradiol-receptor complex to the estradiol response element.\r"

  ".U": "88041125\r", 
  ".W": "Rat muscle phosphoglycerate kinase is one of several enzymes in which age-related effects have been identified. Thus, samples of this enzyme isolated from old rats display a greatly increased heat stability as compared with enzyme isolated from young animals. Previous studies detected no differences in the sequence of amino acids or in the net charge between the young and old forms of the enzyme and it was concluded that the age-related structural modifications are purely conformational. The present study was conducted with the aim of critically testing this hypothesis. To this end, samples of phosphoglycerate kinase purified from skeletal muscle of young and old rats were unfolded by an 18-hr incubation in a 2 M guanidine hydrochloride solution at 4 degrees C, a treatment that results in extensive loss of the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme. A complete reactivation of both enzymes was achieved by dilution of the unfolded enzyme solutions into a large excess of denaturant-free buffer followed by 4 hr of incubation at 25 degrees C. The reactivation kinetics of the unfolded young and old enzymes were practically identical and the refolded products, compared using heat-inactivation kinetics as a sensitive probe, were found to be identical. Moreover, their heat inactivation coincided with that of young untreated phosphoglycerate kinase. These results demonstrate the reversibility of age-related effects at the molecular level and provide strong support for the hypothesis that the modifications in phosphoglycerate kinase in old muscle are purely conformational and, hence, clearly postsynthetic.\r"

It is composed of nonidentical alpha (Mr 240,000) and beta (Mr 220,000) subunits, each of which contains multiple homologous 106-amino acid segments. We report here the isolation and characterization of a human erythroid-specific beta-spectrin cDNA clone that encodes parts of the beta-9 through beta-12 repeat segments. This cDNA was used as a hybridization probe to assign the beta-spectrin gene to human chromosome 14 and to begin molecular analysis of the gene and its mRNA transcripts. RNA transfer blot analysis showed that the reticulocyte beta-spectrin mRNA is 7.8 kilobases in length. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA revealed the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) within the beta-spectrin gene locus. The isolation of human spectrin cDNA probes and the identification of closely linked RFLPs will facilitate analysis of mutant spectrin genes causing congenital hemolytic anemias associated with quantitative and qualitative spectrin abnormalities.\r"

It thus was striking to find that cloned rDNA from the frog Xenopus laevis is specifically transcribed in extracts prepared from mouse cells. The data in this paper demonstrate that this heterologous transcription is due to a normal initiation process and not to a fortuitous event. Transcription of Xenopus rDNA in the mouse cell extract is directed by the same large promoter (residue-141 to +6) that is utilized to promote the synthesis of frog rRNA in homologous Xenopus systems. Moreover, the same factors of the mouse cell extract that transcribe the homologous mouse rDNA also catalyze transcription from the X. laevis rDNA promoter. We conclude that polymerase I transcriptional machinery does not evolve as rapidly as prior studies would suggest.\r"

The first peak, which was eluted at a slightly greater volume than the native Hb, consisted of reassociated hexagonal bilayer structures when examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy. The dimensions of the two reassociated hexagonal bilayer structures were a vertex-to-vertex diameter of 25 nm and a height of 16 nm. The difference in size between the hexagonal bilayer structures and the native Hb is the contribution of subunit M, which consists of a single heme-containing chain I (16.75 kDa). Although the reassociated hexagonal bilayer structures have overall dimensions smaller than the 30 nm x 20 nm dimensions of the native Hb, the diameters of the central cavities are not substantially altered. Subtraction of the three-dimensional reconstructions of the reassociated hexagonal bilayer structures from those of the native Hb showed that subunit M was primarily localized at the periphery of Lumbricus Hb. The formation of hexagonal bilayer structures in the complete absence of subunit M provides additional support for the \"bracelet\" model of the quaternary structure of Lumbricus Hb proposed recently by us in which subunits D1 and D2 were assumed to act as linkers for complexes of subunits M and T or to form a \"bracelet\" decorated with 12 complexes of subunits M and T.\r"

  ".W": "Hepatocytes in normal rat liver were found previously to contain a cytoplasmic 14,000-dalton polypeptide (p14) that is associated with mitosis and is the principal early covalent target of activated metabolites of the carcinogen N-2-fluorenylacetamide (2-acetylaminofluorene). The level of immunohistochemically detected p14 was low when growth activity of hepatocytes was low, was markedly elevated during mitosis in normal and regenerating livers, but was very high throughout interphase during proliferation of hyperplastic and malignant hepatocytes induced in rat liver by a carcinogen (N-2-fluorenylacetamide or 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene). We report here that p14 is the liver fatty acid binding protein. The nucleotide sequence of p14 cDNA clones, isolated by screening a rat liver cDNA library in bacteriophage lambda gt11 using p14 antiserum, was completely identical to part of the sequence reported for liver fatty acid binding protein. Furthermore, the two proteins shared the following properties: size of mRNA, amino acid composition, molecular size according to NaDodSO4 gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretic mobilities in a Triton X-100/acetic acid/urea gel. Their pI values overlapped in 2-dimensional isoelectric focusing/NaDodSO4 gel electrophoresis and showed the same response to delipidation. Either polypeptide reacted with and blocked the antiserum raised against the other polypeptide. The two polypeptides bound oleic acid similarly. Finally, identical elevations of cytoplasmic immunostain were detected specifically in mitotic hepatocytes with either antiserum. The collected findings are suggestive that liver fatty acid binding protein may carry ligands that promote hepatocyte division and may transport certain activated chemical carcinogens.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet activating factor (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PAF) induced in isolated rat peritoneal and human peripheral neutrophils a rapid and potent activation of the PAF biosynthetic enzyme acetyl-CoA:1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine O2-acetyltransferase (EC 2.3.1.67). The PAF-induced activation of the neutrophil acetyltransferase (8-10 times basal neutrophil activity) was maximal within 30 sec after PAF addition, as was the PAF-stimulated degranulation. After 1 min of PAF stimulation, the elevated acetyltransferase activity steadily decreased. Within 2 min of stimulation of neutrophils with 10(-6) M PAF, the 7-fold increase in acetyltransferase activity was coincident with substantial PAF synthesis (as measured by [3H]acetate incorporation into PAF), which was 14% of the PAF synthesis induced by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 at 10(-5) M. PAF activation of the acetyltransferase and PAF synthesis required intact neutrophils as they did not occur in cells broken by sonication. The neutrophil acetyltransferase was 10-30 times more sensitive to activation by PAF than was degranulation as the acetyltransferase activation was evident with 10(-9) M PAF and was about maximal with 3 x 10(-8) M PAF. The unstimulated and PAF-induced acetyltransferase exhibited the same Km for acetyl-CoA (67 microM), but the Vmax for the PAF-induced enzyme (1667 pmol/min per 10(7) cells) was 10 times that of the unstimulated enzyme (175 pmol/min per 10(7) cells). The PAF induction of the acetyltransferase was less sensitive to inhibition by the specific PAF receptor antagonist L-652,731 than was PAF-induced degranulation. This, along with the differing sensitivities to PAF, suggests that acetyltransferase activation and degranulation induced by PAF either involve two different PAF receptors or involve one receptor type with different receptor occupancy requirements. Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, which greatly decreased the activity of the acetyltransferase in spleen microsomes, had little or no effect on the basal or PAF-induced neutrophil acetyltransferase. Thus, by stimulating the activity of acetyltransferase, PAF induces in neutrophils the synthesis of more PAF, thereby probably augmenting the neutrophil response to the initial PAF.\r"

  ".W": "The production and repair of radiation-induced DNA damage were measured by filter elution in strains of mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells differing in their sensitivity to ionizing radiation. The induction of radiation-induced damage, as measured by filter elution at pH 12.1, 9.6, and 7.2, was similar in the resistant strain LY-R and the sensitive strain LY-S. The repair of single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, as measured by filter elution at pH 12.1 at various times after irradiation, was somewhat slower in strain LY-S than in strain LY-R, although after a 20-min repair period the extent of repair was equal in the two strains. However, when filter elution was performed at either pH 9.6 or pH 7.2, the repair of x-radiation-induced damage was much less extensive in strain LY-S than in strain LY-R. We have assumed that the extent of filter elution at pH 9.6 is a measure of the occurrence of frank double-strand breaks as well as closely opposing single-strand breaks and pH 9.6-labile sites (and combinations thereof), and that the extent of elution at pH 7.2 is a measure of the occurrence of frank double-strand breaks alone. If these assumptions are correct, the results suggest that the sensitivity of strain LY-S to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation is caused by a deficiency in the ability of this strain to repair frank double-strand breaks and pH 9.6-labile lesions. The repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions was temperature sensitive in strain LY-S, as previously found for cellular recovery processes in this strain. Two independent radiation-resistant variants of strain LY-S, isolated after protracted exposure of LY-S cells to low-dose-rate radiation, showed a deficiency in the repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions similar to that observed in strain LY-S. However, the repair of frank double-strand breaks was more extensive in the radiation-resistant variants than in strain LY-S and was similar in extent to that occurring in strain LY-R after a 60-min postirradiation incubation. The results suggest that there is a difference in the nature of DNA damage measured by filter elution at pH 9.6 vs. pH 7.2 and that a deficiency in the repair of pH 9.6-labile lesions does not contribute to cell lethality in the case of the radiation-resistant variants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Primate involucrins can be precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, resolubilized at pH 8, and subsequently retain aqueous solubility in 67% ethanol. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of keratinocyte extracts after this rapid partial purification has revealed in each species tested one (chimpanzee, orangutan, gibbon) or two (gorilla, rhesus, owl, cebus) antigenically crossreactive proteins that migrate in the vicinity of human involucrin. In the species examined further (gorilla, chimpanzee, rhesus), poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from the cultures directed the cell-free translation of polypeptides with mobilities similar to those extracted from the cells. From five cynomolgus monkeys, three different electrophoretic profiles were obtained, suggesting the existence of different alleles. Quantitative comparisons by a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indicated that certain primate involucrins have a higher density of antigenic determinants than the human protein, whereas others lack some determinant(s). In contrast to those from other species, all of which showed substantial crossreactivity, the lemur protein was minimally immunoreactive by immunoblotting and not clearly detected by solid-phase assay. The electrophoretic and antigenic differences displayed throughout the primate order suggest that this protein has been subject to relatively rapid evolution.\r"

Other significant linkages were obtained with several markers from Xq11 to q22. With the help of a recently developed genetic map of the region, it was possible to perform multipoint linkage analysis, and the most likely genetic order is DXS1-(SCID, DXS159)-DXYS1-DXYS12-DXS3, with a maximum multipoint logarithm of odds score of 11.0. Our results demonstrate that the SCID locus (gene symbol IMD4) is not closely linked to the locus of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia (a defect in B-cell maturation).

  ".U": "88041149\r", 
  ".W": "We have characterized a 1400-nucleotide cDNA for the human skeletal muscle ADP/ATP translocator. The deduced amino acid sequence is 94% homologous to the beef heart ADP/ATP translocator protein and contains only a single additional amino-terminal methionine. This implies that the human translocator lacks an amino-terminal targeting peptide, a conclusion substantiated by measuring the molecular weight of the protein synthesized in vitro. A 1400-nucleotide transcript encoding the skeletal muscle translocator was detected on blots of total RNA from human heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, and HeLa cells by hybridization with oligonucleotide probes homologous to the coding region and 3' noncoding region of the cDNA. However, the level of this mRNA varied substantially among tissues. Comparison of our skeletal muscle translocator sequence with that of a recently published human fibroblast translocator cognate revealed that the two proteins are 88% identical and diverged about 275 million years ago. Hence, tissues vary both in the level of expression of individual translocator genes and in differential expression of cognate translocator genes. Comparison of the base substitution rates of the ADP/ATP translocator and the oxidative phosphorylation genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA revealed that the mitochondrial DNA genes fix 10 times more synonymous substitutions and 12 times more replacement substitutions; yet, these nuclear and cytoplasmic respiration genes experience comparable evolutionary constraints. This suggests that the mitochondrial DNA genes are highly prone to deleterious mutations.\r"

All but one of the V beta gene segments analyzed lie 5' of the J beta C beta locus (J beta represents the joining region), with the closest being 280-360 kilobases away. The mutant mouse strain SJL has an internal V beta-region gene deletion that compacts the V beta region by 100-200 kilobases. Taken together with other data, these results indicate that the beta-chain locus can use either a looping-out/deletion or an inversion mechanism to appose V beta to DJ beta gene segments (D is the diversity region) and can accomplish the former (at least) over very large distances.\r"

After interaction of the T-cell receptor with antigen, the T3 proteins are believed to transfer an activation signal to the intracellular compartment. In previous studies, the human gamma, epsilon, and delta chains have been cloned along with the mouse delta chain, but a relationship between these sequences and known molecular families has not been established. We now report the molecular cloning and characterization of the murine T3-epsilon protein and a sequence and structural analysis of the relationships between all the T3 chains and the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is established that the T3 chains are immunoglobulin-related and a particular relationship to the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) is noted. This sequence relationship adds interest to previous findings that the T3 chains are genetically linked to N-CAM and Thy-1 antigen on band q23 of human chromosome 11.\r"

Intracellular erythrocyte pH was also measured in normotensive rats on different dietary calcium intakes as well as in volume-dependent deoxycorticosterone/saline and renin-dependent, 2 kidney, 1 clip (2K-1C) Goldblatt hypertensive rat models. Untreated essential hypertensives had significantly lower intracellular pH values compared with normotensive subjects [7.17 +/- 0.02 vs. 7.28 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SEM), significance level = 0.01]. Treated hypertensives had intracellular pH values indistinguishable from normotensives [7.27 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SEM)]. Similarly, pH values for each rat model varied inversely with blood pressure, regardless of whether increased dietary calcium intake lowered pressure (normotensive and deoxycorticosterone/saline hypertensive rats) or elevated it (2K-1C Goldblatt hypertensive rats). These results demonstrate that lower intracellular pH values are commonly observed in various hypertensive states and suggest that they may contribute to the pathophysiology of the hypertensive process. Alterations in intracellular pH may also underlie the clinically observed linkage of hypertension with other disease syndromes, such as diabetes mellitus and obesity.\r"

The resistant phenotype was unstable and was maintained by weekly treatment of the cells with HN2. Growing the resistant cells in the absence of HN2 resulted in a time-dependent decrease in both resistance to HN2 and topoisomerase II activity and an increase in DNA interstrand crosslinking induced by HN2. We hypothesize that HN2 resistance is due to enhanced monoadduct repair with resultant decreased DNA crosslinking and that this process is mediated by topoisomerase II.\r"

  ".U": "88041168\r", 
  ".W": "To investigate patterns of endogenous hormone release, we have proposed a biophysical model in which measured hormone concentrations at any given instant reflect the operation of a suitable cumulation function (secretory input) convolved with an appropriate elimination mechanism (metabolic clearance). The cumulation function underlying a macroscopic hormone secretory burst can be represented by a random (Gaussian) distribution of instantaneous molecular secretory rates, which are centered with some finite and determinable standard deviation about a particular moment in time. The hormone elimination mechanism is described by a mono- or biexponential clearance function. The resultant convolution integral is solved by iterative nonlinear least-squares parameter estimation, in which all plasma hormone concentrations and their variances are considered simultaneously. Experiments with human endocrine time series revealed that the spontaneous secretory patterns of any of multiple distinct anterior pituitary hormones (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, growth hormone, prolactin, thyrotropin, and adrenocorticotropic hormone) can be described effectively by this parsimonious model. In addition, endogenous hormone disappearance rates determined by deconvolution agreed well with those reported earlier that were determined after exogenous hormone injections. Moreover, this model predicted that durations of underlying secretory impulses are extremely brief; i.e., the standard deviations of the Gaussian distributions of instantaneous secretory rates range from 4.5 min (luteinizing hormone) to 16 min (growth hormone) compared to plasma hormone concentration peaks of 90-140 min in duration. Accordingly, we conclude that observed physiological patterns of fluctuating plasma hormone concentrations can be accounted for by distinct, highly delimited, random bursts of hormone release separated by intervals of secretory quiescence.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies suggested that natural killer (NK) cells are involved in the regulation of the growth and differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. To establish whether the effector cells responsible for the in vivo resistance to bone marrow (BM) transplants and the in vitro inhibition of colony-forming units (CFU) may represent identical or overlapping populations, we used a rat system for syngeneic BM transplantation, with and without the transfer of large numbers of peripheral blood large granular lymphocytes (LGLs). BM reconstitution was measured by the in vivo formation of syngeneic CFU in the spleen (CFU-s). Because of the very low frequency of CFU-s in normal rat BM, we fractionated BM cells in Percoll density gradients, which provided a 2- to 5-fold enrichment in CFU-s in the lower-density fractions. Although these fractions contained less than 10% of the total cells, they contained greater than 75% of the CFU-s and allowed for the transfer of significantly fewer donor cells. At the time of BM transplantation, radiation-resistant asialoganglioside GM1-positive LGLs, with high NK activity, accounted for a significant percentage of the lymphoid cells in the irradiated recipient. The in vivo regulatory role of these cells on engraftment was demonstrated by their depletion (by i.v. injection of small amounts of anti-asialo-GM1 antiserum before BM transplantation), which resulted in a significant increase in the number of CFU-s. Conversely, a 50% inhibition in CFU-s was found when CFU-s-enriched BM fractions were preincubated in vitro with LGLs. Additional experiments, involving selective in vivo depletion of NK cells followed by LGL repopulation, directly demonstrated the involvement of LGLs in the regulation and growth of syngeneic pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Our results further support the hypothesis that LGLs are involved directly or via humoral factors in the homeostasis and regulation of hematopoietic stem cell growth and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We have previously reported the isolation of a human breast cancer cell line resistant to doxorubicin (adriamycin; AdrR MCF-7 cells) that has also developed the phenotype of multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR in this cell line is associated with increased expression of mdr (P glycoprotein) gene sequences. The development of MDR in AdrR MCF-7 cells is also associated with changes in the expression of several phase I and phase II drug-detoxifying enzymes. These changes are remarkably similar to those associated with development of xenobiotic resistance in rat hyperplastic liver nodules, a well-studied model system of chemical carcinogenesis. Using an mdr-encoded cDNA sequence isolated from AdrR MCF-7 cells, we have examined the expression of mdr sequences in rat livers under a variety of experimental conditions. The expression of mdr increased 3-fold in regenerating liver. It was also elevated (3- to 12-fold) in several different samples of rat hyperplastic nodules and in four of five hepatomas that developed in this system. This suggests that overexpression of mdr, a gene previously associated with resistance to antineoplastic agents, may also be involved in the development of resistance to xenobiotics in rat hyperplastic nodules. In addition, although the acute administration of 2-acetylaminofluorene induced an 8-fold increase in hepatic mdr-encoded RNA, performance of a partial hepatectomy either before or after administration of 2-acetylaminofluorene resulted in a greater than 80-fold increase in mdr gene expression over that in normal untreated livers. This represents an important in vivo model system in which to study the acute regulation of this drug resistance gene.\r"

On the assumption that the basolateral membrane of epithelial cells and plasma membrane of parenchymal cells are functional analogues, we studied transport of cationic amino acids by cultured skin fibroblasts from LPI and control subjects matched for age, sex, and site of biopsy. We measured Na+-independent transport of radiolabeled lysine, arginine, ornithine, and homoarginine on system y+, the carrier with preference for cationic amino acids, and leucine transport on system L (as the internal control). LPI cells had increased net uptake of cationic amino acids (nmol/mg of protein) relative to leucine. LPI cells also maintained increased steady-state intracellular pools of cationic amino acids. Neither increased metabolic utilization nor increased pool size were responsible for high uptake of cationic amino acids in LPI cells. We then measured trans-stimulated efflux of homoarginine as a specific test of system y+ activity. Homoarginine efflux was significantly impaired in LPI cells (P less than 0.05), whereas leucine efflux was similar in LPI and control cells. Percent trans-stimulation of homoarginine efflux was 1.0 +/- 0.5% in homozygous LPI cells, 10 +/- 0.5% in heterozygous cells, and 22 +/- 0.5% in control cells indicating a gene-dosage effect. The LPI mutation affects system y+ asymmetrically, selectively impairing efflux in fibroblast plasma membrane. To our knowledge, this appears to be the first demonstration that the skin fibroblast can be used to study a corresponding transport defect in intestinal and renal membranes.\r"

We now present immunologic and affinity crosslinking data to show that this binding species is the type II IGF receptor. Rat serum was gel-filtered on a Sephadex G-200 column (0.05 M NH4HCO3, pH 8), and 125I-labeled IGF-II (125I-IGF-II) binding was measured in individual column fractions. 125I-IGF-II binding activity was found in the void volume of the column in addition to the carrier protein regions. Competitive binding studies using 125I-IGF-II and binding activity from the Sephadex G-200 void volume showed the characteristics of the type II receptor: IGF-II was more potent than IGF-I, and insulin did not compete. Moreover, a specific anti-type II IGF receptor antibody (no. 3637) completely blocked 125I-IGF-II binding. 125I-IGF-I did not bind to the void volume pool, demonstrating the absence of the type I IGF receptor in rat serum. Affinity crosslinking of 125I-IGF-II to the Sephadex G-200 void volume material demonstrated a specific band at 210 kDa without reduction and at 240 kDa after reduction of disulfide bonds. The serum type II IGF receptor size was confirmed by immunoblotting the void volume material with antiserum 3637, which revealed a band slightly smaller (approximately 10 kDa) than the type II IGF receptor from rat placental membranes. Immunoquantitation by immunoblotting using pure type II IGF receptor from rat placental membranes as standard showed a developmental pattern. In fetal rat serum (19-days gestation) and in sera from 3-, 10-, and 20-day-old rats, the concentrations of receptor protein were similar (1-5 micrograms/ml). The level of the type II IGF receptor in serum declined dramatically between age 20 and 40 days, but the receptor was still measurable at age 12 mo. We conclude that the type II IGF receptor is present in rat serum and is developmentally regulated.\r"

  ".U": "88041176\r", 
  ".W": "It has been postulated that low density lipoprotein (LDL) becomes fully atherogenic only if it first undergoes oxidative modification. The oxidatively modified form, but not native LDL, is recognized by the acetyl-LDL or \"scavenger\" receptor and could, therefore, be taken up rapidly by tissue macrophages to generate the fatty-streak lesion of atherosclerosis. However, there is thus far very little direct evidence for oxidative modification in vivo. The studies reported here take advantage of the fact that probucol is an effective antioxidant transported in lipoproteins, including LDL, and blocks the oxidative modification of LDL in vitro. We now show that the rate of degradation of LDL in the macrophage-rich fatty-streak lesions of the LDL receptor-deficient rabbit treated with probucol (1% by weight in the diet) is reduced to about one-half of that in the lesions of receptor-deficient rabbits not given probucol (but matched for plasma cholesterol levels). In contrast, the rates of degradation in the nonlesioned areas of the aorta were no different in probucol-treated and control animals. Most of the LDL degradation in fatty-streak lesions takes place in macrophages, whereas in nonlesioned aorta, which contains very few macrophages, the degradation is almost exclusively in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Thus, the results are compatible with the postulate that the native LDL taken up and degraded by foam cells in the developing fatty-streak lesions was in part first converted to a form recognized by the scavenger receptor (by oxidative or analogous modification). Finally, and most importantly, we show that treatment with probucol significantly reduced the rate of development of fatty-streak lesions even though plasma cholesterol levels were no lower than lovastatin-treated (control) rabbits.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies suggest that phosphorylation may regulate the rate of desensitization of nicotinic acetylcholine (AcCho) receptors (AcChoR) in vertebrate muscle and Torpedo. It is not known if phosphorylation is involved in regulation of the neuronal AcChoR, however. In this study we examine the possibility that protein kinase C might regulate nicotinic AcChoR function in neurons. Several activators of protein kinase C (1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, phorbol 12,13-diacetate, and phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) were tested for their ability to modulate AcChoR function in embryonic chicken sympathetic ganglion neurons. Neurons were voltage-clamped at the resting potential, and the response to AcCho was tested before and after treatment with activators of protein kinase C. We find that all of these agents enhance the rate of decay of AcCho-induced current without affecting peak current amplitude or cellular input resistance. The drugs were ineffective if applied concurrently with AcCho: significant effects could be detected after 60 sec of pretreatment. A phorbol that does not increase protein kinase C activity (4 beta-phorbol) was ineffective in enhancing the decay of AcCho-induced current. Thus, the effects of these agents on AcChoR function are likely to be mediated by their interaction with C kinase, rather than by direct interaction with the AcChoR channel. Our data suggest that kinase C may regulate agonist-induced desensitization of the neuronal AcChoR channel.\r"

  ".W": "The 8D9 antigen, a cell surface protein isolated from chicken brain that is related to the L1 class of cell adhesion molecules, is shown to contain an activity that promotes the attachment of neurons and the outgrowth of neurites from chicken tecta and mouse cerebellum. When purified 8D9 antigen is attached to a nitrocellulose-coated substrate, neurons rapidly attach and extend unfasciculated neurites. Little or no attachment of astroglia, oligodendroglia, and fibroblast-like cells to the 8D9 antigen is observed. We propose that a function of the 8D9 antigen is that of a neurite extension-promoting substrate in axon fascicles and in regeneration of peripheral nerves.\r"

  ".U": "88041183\r", 
  ".W": "Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a protein supporting the in vitro survival of a characteristic spectrum of embryonic chicken and rat peripheral neurons. High-speed supernatants of extracts from two neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines--the mouse C 1300 N2a and the human IMR 32--mimic the effects of CNTF on identical target neurons. Promotion of survival is dose-dependent with an ED50 of 80 micrograms (IMR 32) and 140 micrograms (C 1300 N2a) of protein per ml and saturable at plateau values for surviving neurons identical to those achieved with purified CNTF. Small amounts of a CNTF-like material are also detectable in medium conditioned by NB cells. The activity is destroyed by heat and trypsin and not blocked by antibodies to (mouse) nerve growth factor. Unlike the neurite-promoting and neuronal-survival modulating agent laminin, it cannot be depleted on poly(L-alpha-ornithine)-coated plastic surfaces. NB IMR 32 cell extracts were electrophoresed using NaDodSO4/PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Ciliary ganglion neurons seeded on the blotting paper in culture medium lacking CNTF (\"cell blot\") exclusively survive on two distinct bands with apparent molecular masses of 24 and 48 kDa. Twenty-four kilodaltons is the molecular mass of a CNTF purified from rat sciatic nerve. These results suggest that NB cells may contain a CNTF-like protein and provide further evidence that neurons may store neurotrophic factors. Purified (chicken) CNTF failed to affect proliferation and neurite growth of NB cells. The biological relevance of CNTF for NB cells, therefore, remains to be elucidated.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular and subcellular distributions of mRNAs encoding three myelin-specific proteins--myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP), and Po protein--were studied in tissue sections of developing rat nervous systems by in situ hybridization. The developmental appearance of these mRNAs closely paralleled the appearance of the proteins they encode as determined by immunocytochemistry. mRNA encoding the extrinsic membrane protein, MBP, was concentrated around oligodendrocyte and Schwann cell nuclei during initial stages of myelination; as myelination proceeded, MBP mRNA became distributed diffusely over myelinated fibers. In contrast, mRNAs encoding the intrinsic membrane proteins, PLP and Po, remained concentrated around oligodendrocyte (PLP) and Schwann cell (Po) nuclei at all stages of myelination. These results establish that myelinating cells spatially segregate certain myelin-specific mRNAs. The presence of MBP mRNA within the cytoplasmic domains of myelin internodes indicates that protein sorting during myelination involves transportation of mRNA to specific subcellular sites.\r"

  ".U": "88041187\r", 
  ".W": "Extracellular recordings were obtained from single neurons located in the lateral septum, an area known to receive a vasopressinergic innervation in the rat brain. Approximately half of the neurons tested responded to 8-L-arginine vasopressin (AVP) by a marked increase in firing rate at concentrations greater than 1 nM. The effect of vasopressin was blocked by synthetic structural analogues possessing antagonistic properties on peripheral vasopressin and oxytocin receptors. Oxytocin was much less potent than vasopressin in firing septal neurons, and a selective oxytocic agonist was totally ineffective. The action of vasopressin on neuronal firing was mimicked by the vasopressor agonist [2-phenylalanine,8-ornithine]vasotocin but not by the selective antidiuretic agonist 1-deamino[8-D-arginine]vasopressin. In a parallel study, sites that bind [3H]AVP at low concentration (1.5 nM) were found by in vitro autoradiography in the lateral septum. Adjacent sections were also incubated with 1.5 mM [3H]AVP and, in addition, with 100 nM [2-phenylalanine,8-ornithine]vasotocin or 1-deamino[8-D-arginine]vasopressin--i.e., the same compounds as those used for the electrophysiological study. Results showed that the vasopressor agonist, but not the antidiuretic agonist, displaced [3H]AVP, thus indicating that the vasopressin binding sites detected by autoradiography in the septum were V1 (vasopressor type) rather than V2 (antidiuretic type) receptors. Based on the electrophysiological evidence, we conclude that these receptors, when occupied, lead to increased firing of lateral septal neurons.\r"

The carotid sinus and vagus nerves were cut, and end-tidal PCO2 and temperature were kept constant with servo-controllers. Phrenic nerve activity was used to quantitate central respiratory activity. Repeated doses of progesterone (from 0.1 to 2.0 micrograms/kg, cumulative) caused a sustained (greater than 45 min) facilitation of phrenic nerve activity in female and male cats; however, the response was much more variable in females. Progesterone injected into the region of nucleus tractus solitarii, a respiratory-related area in the medulla oblongata, also caused a prolonged stimulation of respiration. Progesterone administration at high concentration by both routes also caused a substantial hypotension. Identical i.v. doses of other classes of steroid hormones (17 beta-estradiol, testosterone, and cortisol) did not elicit the same respiratory effect. Pretreatment with RU 486, a progesterone-receptor antagonist, blocked the facilitatory effect of progesterone. We conclude that progesterone acts centrally through a steroid receptor-mediated mechanism to facilitate respiration.\r"

  ".U": "88041190\r", 
  ".W": "To elucidate the role of cytosolic calcium, [Ca2+]i, in the physiology of the normal and ischemic heart, we have developed a method for recording [Ca2+]i transients from the epicardial surface of the rabbit ventricle after arterial perfusion with the cell-permeant cytosolic calcium indicator indo-1 AM. Hearts were illuminated at 360 nm, and fluorescence was recorded simultaneously at 400 and 550 nm. The F400/F550 fluorescence ratio was calculated by an analog circuit that allowed cancelation of small movement artifacts that were present at single wavelengths. Clear [Ca2+]i transients were present in the F400/F550 signal and were remarkable for their slow decay. Slow decay of the transients was not due to buffering of [Ca2+]i by indo-1, since there was no associated impairment of contraction or relaxation. The peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transients was increased by ouabain, adrenaline, postextrasystolic potentiation, and acetylcholine. The extent to which the transients decayed diminished with shortening of the interbeat interval, but decay of the transients could be further diminished by acetylcholine or caffeine. A major advantage of the intact heart over isolated myocytes is the ability to measure changes in [Ca2+]i during ischemia. Ischemia produced a marked increase in both peak systolic and end-diastolic [Ca2+]i, which was most rapid during the first 30 sec, and approached a plateau value after 90 sec. This increase in [Ca2+]i was associated with a characteristic broadening of the peak of the transient. The increase in [Ca2+]i during ischemia is consistent with a proposed causative role of [Ca2+]i in mediating early electrophysiological abnormalities.\r"

  ".W": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a common, hereditary, neurobehavioral disorder of childhood. To determine the frequency of various behavioral manifestations, we have compared 47 random normal controls to 246 patients with TS, 17 with attention-deficit disorder (ADD), and 15 with ADD secondary to a TS gene (ADD 2(0) TS). All subjects were examined prospectively with a 425-item questionnaire based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM III). The TS patients were divided into grade 1 (too mild to treat [17.5%]), grade 2 (requiring treatment [58.9%]), and grade 3 (severe [23.6%]). Patients in all three grades of TS were significantly different from controls for DSM III symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Sixty-two percent of TS patients had ADD, compared with 6.3% of controls; and 48.8% had ADD with hyperactivity (ADDH), compared with 4.2% of controls. In the majority of TS patients, the natural history of the disease was to start with ADDH and 2.4 years later develop motor and vocal tics. Among TS patients, 39% had previously received medication for ADDH or behavior problems, compared with 2% of the controls. Although stimulants can occasionally exacerbate tics, there was no evidence that stimulants cause TS and they are often a valuable adjunct to the treatment of TS. It is estimated that 10%-30% of ADDH is due to or associated with the presence of a TS gene. TS patients had a significantly increased frequency of (1) attending classes for the educationally handicapped, (2) placement in classes for the severely emotionally disturbed, (3) attending any special classes, (4) severe test anxiety, (5) stuttering, (6) letter, number, or word reversal, (7) reading very slowly, and (8) poor retention of material read. A reading-problem score (dyslexia) greater than or equal to 3 was present in 26.8% of TS patients, compared with 4.2% of controls. Number reversal, word reversal, and poor retention were significant even for the TS patients with tics too mild to treat. The multiple ways in which TS impacts school performance, as well as potential remedies, are discussed.\r"

With the exception of running away from home and being in trouble with the law, TS patients were significantly different from controls in all other behaviors. When the components were combined for a total conduct score, only one (2.1%) of the controls had a score greater than 13, and he had TS. By contrast, 35% of the TS patients had scores greater than 13 (P less than .0005). The correlation coefficient between the total conduct score and ADD score was .48. Although the presence of ADD was an important factor in determining conduct in TS, other factors such as depression and compulsive behavior also played a contributing role. There was little correlation between the total conduct score and the number of tics. It is estimated that among non-economically disadvantaged children, 10%-30% of conduct disorder may be due to the presence of a TS gene.\r"

Only 8.5% of controls had more than three simple phobias and none had more than five, whereas 26% of TS patients had more than three (P = .008) and some had as many as 13. As opposed to 19% of TS patients, none of the controls had phobias that interfered with their life (P = .001). Among female TS patients 55.1% had 3-13 phobias, compared with 8.7% of the female controls (P less than .0005). There was no correlation between the ADD score and the number of phobias (r = -.010) and little correlation with the total number of tics (r = .14). Panic attacks were present in 8.3% of the controls and 33% of the TS patients (P = .0008). This frequency increased to 55.2% (P less than .0005) for grade 3 (severe) TS patients. None of the controls, 15.9% of all TS patients (P = .002), and 31% of grade 3 TS patients (P less than .0005) had more than three panic attacks in 1 wk. Total panic-symptom score (12 possible symptoms) was significantly greater than that in the controls in all grades of TS. The presence or absence of ADD had little effect on the total panic-symptom score, but the presence of ADD resulted in a significantly lower average age at onset of panic attacks (8.8 years) compared with those TS patients without ADD (15.4 years) (P = .03). These observations indicate that phobias and panic attacks are a significant part of the symptomatology of TS and provide the first clear indication that phobias and panic attacks can be due to the presence of a major gene.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the frequency of obsessive, compulsive, and schizoid behaviors in Tourette syndrome (TS), we prospectively questioned 246 patients with TS, 17 with attention-deficit disorder (ADD), 15 with ADD due to a TS gene, and 47 random controls. The comparative frequency of obsessive, compulsive, and repetitive behaviors--such as obsessive unpleasant thoughts, obsessive silly thoughts, echolalia, palilalia, touching things excessively, touching things a specific number of times, touching others excessively, sexual touching, biting or hurting oneself, head banging, rocking, mimicking others, counting things, and occasional or frequent public exhibitionism--were significantly more common in TS patients than in controls. The frequency of each of these was much higher for grade 3 (severe) TS. Most of these behaviors also occurred significantly more often in individuals with ADD or in individuals with ADD secondary to TS (ADD 2(0) TS). When these features were combined into an obsessive-compulsive score, 45.4% of TS patients had a score of 4-15, whereas 8.5% of controls had a score of 4 or 5. These results indicate that obsessive-compulsive behaviors are an integral part of the expression of the TS gene and can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Schizoid symptoms, such as thinking that people were watching them or plotting against them, were significantly more common in TS patients than in controls. Auditory hallucinations of hearing voices were present in 14.6% of TS patients, compared with 2.1% of controls (P = .02). These symptoms were absent in ADD patients but present in ADD 2(0) TS patients. These voices were often blamed for telling them to do bad things and were frequently identified with the devil. None of the controls had a total schizoid behavior score greater than 3, whereas 10.9% of the TS patients had scores of 4-10 (P = .02). This frequency increased to 20.6% in the grade 3 TS patients. These quantitative results confirm our clinical impression that some TS patients have paranoid ideations, often feel that people are out to get them, and hear voices.\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the role of depression and mania in Tourette syndrome (TS), we have examined 246 TS patients, 17 attention-deficit disorder (ADD) patients, 15 patients with ADD associated with TS, and 47 controls, using (1) the standardized National Institutes of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule questions for a life history of major depression and/or mania and (2) a modified Beck depression score for evaluation of depression at the time of the examination. The results were combined into depression, Beck, and mania scores. Among the controls, 2.1% had a depression score greater than 9, and none had a score greater than 10. Among the TS patients, 22.9% had a score greater than 9 and the scores ranged up to the maximum of 18 (P less than .0005). None of the pure ADD patients had a score greater than 6, whereas 20% of the ADD-secondary-to-TS (ADD 2(0) TS) patients had scores greater than or equal to 9. Among grade 3 TS patients, 46.6% had scores greater than or equal to 9. There were no differences in the frequency of depression in the TS patients with or without ADD. Comparable results were obtained for the Beck depression score, except that the percent with a score greater than or equal to 8 was higher for the TS patients with ADD (23.7%) than for those without ADD (9.3%). There was a good correlation between the depression score and the Beck score (r = .63), but no correlation between the ADD-with-hyperactivity (ADDH) score and either the depression score (r = .086) or the Beck score (r = .077). Among the controls, none had a mania score greater than or equal to 4, compared with 19.1% of the total TS patients (P = less than .0005), 11.8% of the ADD patients (P = .002), and 26.6% of the ADD 2(0) TS patients (P = .0005). Although some of the mania questions would be expected to be answered positively by ADDH patients, the correlation coefficient between the ADDH scores and the mania scores was only moderate (r = .29), whereas the correlation with the depression score was much higher (r = .63). There was minimal correlation between the number of tics and either the depression score (r = .267) or the Beck score (r = .193). We conclude that depression and manic-depressive symptoms are common in TS patients and are an integral part of the disorder rather than being secondary to motor or vocal tics.\r"

There were no significant differences in age of first talking or walking. By contrast, there were significant differences in problems with bladder and bowel control between TS patients and controls, as measured by age of first toilet training, age of last bed-wetting, frequency of enuresis, and age that bowel control was achieved. Sleep problems were pervasive in TS patients, with a significantly increased frequency of sleepwalking, night terrors, trouble getting to sleep, early awakening, and inability to take afternoon naps as a young child. In all diagnostic categories, including mild (grade 1) TS patients, a total sleep-problem score was significantly greater than that in controls. The sleep disorders and other TS symptoms are consistent with TS as a disorder of disinhibition of the limbic system. Allergies and left-handedness have been evoked as contributing to or being associated with ADD and learning disorders. There were no significant differences in the frequency of allergies or left-handedness in TS patients compared with that in controls. We conclude that when there is a clearly defined genetic cause of ADD and learning disorders, it is not associated with an increased frequency of allergies or left-handedness.\r"

Eight widely spaced X-linked DNA markers were used to genotype 43 family members. In contrast to a published study of another family, in whom complete linkage of X-linked recessive HSP to distal chromosome Xq markers DXS15 and DXS52 was reported, we observed complete linkage with two DNA markers, pYNH3 and DXS17, located on the middle of the long arm of the X chromosome. These data have been combined with linkage data from a large reference panel of normal families to localize the new X-chromosome marker, pYNH3, and to provide evidence of significant locus heterogeneity between phenotypically distinct forms of X-linked recessive HSP.\r"

On days 120 to 125 of gestation, blood samples were drawn from the aorta and vena cava of five crossbred ewes at 15-minute intervals for 1 hour before, during, and for 1 hour after a 3-hour infusion of isoproterenol (0.16 microgram/kg/min) or normal saline solution. Plasma prostaglandin F2 alpha levels increased (177% +/- 13% SEM over baseline; p less than 0.002) in maternal aorta, while plasma 13,14-dihydro-15-keto prostaglandin F2 alpha levels increased in both aorta and vena cava (354% +/- 47% and 309% +/- 75% over baseline, respectively; p less than 0.002) during isoproterenol infusion but not during saline solution infusion. No change was seen in plasma prostaglandin E2 levels. The increase in plasma stimulatory prostaglandins in the pregnant ewe during beta-agonist infusion is compatible with the increased uterine activity observed after myometrial desensitization by continuous beta-agonist infusion.\r"

  ".W": "Three antiprogestogens of the RU 38.486, ZK 98.734, and ZK 98.299, were studied at different stages of pregnancy in the guinea pig. Treatment starting on postconception day 4 completely prevented nidation; all three compounds had comparable inhibitory potency. Treatment after nidation, starting on postconception day 8, induced decidual collapse and bleeding, but embryonic tissue was retained in nidation sites. In contrast to results in animals in nonfertile cycles, luteolysis was not induced, indicating that antiprogestogens lack the ability to induce uterine prostaglandin synthesis/liberation. On postconception day 43, RU 38.486 showed marginal abortifacient activity. The other compounds induced expulsion more rapidly and at a higher rate. The comparatively pronounced antiglucocorticoid activity of RU 38.486 may account for this difference. With RU 38.486, a high level of uterine prostaglandin sensitivity and a cervical ripening were induced consistently and fast; spontaneous labor, on the other hand, occurred after several days, if at all. Complete uterine evacuation was induced within hours by otherwise inactive doses of sulprostone in various combinations with ZK 98.299 RU 38.486 but surprisingly not with ZK 98.734. A single dose of ZK 98.299 induced an approximately thirtyfold increase in uterine prostaglandin sensitivity within 24 hours, exceeding that present before term, but did not induce spontaneous labor. This is evidence that endogenous prostaglandins were not activated, analogous to perinidation stages. Observation of antiluteolytic activity of antiprogestogens in nonpregnant animals is considered of major theoretical importance in this context. It seems that inhibition of progesterone leads to suppressed uterine prostaglandin liberation. The same effect in pregnancy could explain the inability of the uterus to expel a seriously compromised conceptus. In conclusion, we suggest that progesterone is a stimulator rather than a depressor of uterine prostaglandins in the late luteal phase and pregnancy. The ability of the conceptus to neutralize this stimulatory action of progesterone is considered to be essential for the rescue of the corpus luteum and uterine motor quiescence in the guinea pig. The clinical significance of these findings is that the high frequency of incomplete abortions and protracted, sometimes heavy bleeding in pregnant women treated with RU 38.486 may reflect decidual compromise and simultaneous uterine prostaglandin deficiency, as found in our animal model after progesterone blockage.\r"

Heart rate, blood pressure, and clinical signs as well as symptoms suggestive of a disulfiram-type reaction were also noted. Five of eight volunteers that received cefotetan showed significant flushing. A significant increase in heart rate also was noted. No change in mean arterial pressure was observed during the cefotetan phase, and no one experienced nausea or vomiting. No statistical differences were observed between phases with respect to ethanol area under the time-concentration curve, elimination rate, or serum acetaldehyde concentrations.

Concentrations in serum and urine were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Concentrations in serum following different parenteral ofloxacin dosages demonstrated dose dependency with long biological half-lives of 231 to 267 min. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated on the basis of open two- and three-compartment models, which yielded nearly identical results. High volumes of distribution (1.2 to 1.4 liters/kg of body weight) suggested effective diffusion into the extravascular space. High total and renal clearances indicated primarily renal excretion with additional elimination pathways, such as tubular secretion and extrarenal elimination. After oral administration, absorption was excellent, and the absolute bioavailability following 200 mg of ofloxacin could be calculated at greater than 0.95. Maximal concentrations in serum were attained 1.2 to 1.9 h after dosing; areas under the curve increased in proportion to dose between 200 and 400 mg of oral ofloxacin. The amount of known metabolites (demethyl and N-oxide compounds) excreted in urine reached only 4.3% (intravenously) and 4.0% (orally).

Ring preparations of the vessels were mounted in organ baths and isometric tension was measured. Prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) 10(-7)-10(-4) mol litre-1 produced concentration-dependent contractile responses that were inhibited by thiopentone 10(-4)-10(-3) mol litre-1 and by chlormethiazole 3 x 10(-4)-3 x 10(-3) mol litre-1. Thiopentone 10(-4)-10(-3) mol litre-1 and chlormethiazole 3 x 10(-4)-3 x 10(-3) mol litre-1 decreased the tension in vessels previously treated with PGF2 alpha 10(-5) mol litre-1. Chlormethiazole 3 x 10(-3) mol litre-1 inhibited, and thiopentone 10(-4)-10(-3) mol litre-1 abolished contractile responses to 5-hydroxytryptamine. Contractions induced by angiotensin II were inhibited by thiopentone 10(-3) mol litre-1 and chlormethiazole 3 x 10(-3) mol litre-1. The concentrations of the two drugs needed to affect contractile activation of isolated human stem villous arteries exceeded the free plasma concentrations reached during anaesthesia induced by the agents during Caesarean section, and the present results do not suggest any major effects of thiopentone or chlormethiazole on fetal placental vascular resistance during the clinical use of these drugs.\r"

Seventy (30%) of these patients had significant falls in antibody levels. In 44 patients these declines occurred after further antigenic exposure was reduced either because no transfusions were administered or only histocompatible platelets were transfused. Forty patients with declines in LCTAb levels who were previously refractory to platelet transfusion were rechallenged with random donor platelets. Thirty-four of 35 clinically evaluable patients had good responses to these unmatched transfusions for 2 weeks to 36 months, and in 21 patients antibody did not return despite repeated transfusions. Thus, serial LCTAb measurements are helpful in the management of alloimmunized patients. Many patients will have decreases or a loss of LCTAb, either permanently or transiently, and can be successfully supported with more easily available unmatched random donor platelet transfusions.\r"

We investigated the in vitro interaction of TNF alpha and RA with normal and a variety of leukemic myeloid cells. With the promyelocytic HL-60 cells, TNF alpha (greater than or equal to 2.5 U/mL) in combination with RA synergistically inhibited clonal growth; TNF alpha at lower concentrations (less than or equal to 1 U/mL) plus RA (10(-9) mol/L) were antagonistic in their inhibition of growth. The ability of RA (10(-8) mol/L) plus TNF alpha (2.5, 5 U/mL) to enhance differentiation of HL-60 cells paralleled their ability to inhibit clonal growth of these cells. In addition, RA (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) increased the number of TNF alpha receptors on HL-60 cells 1.3- to 1.7-fold without changing the affinity for the TNF alpha receptor. With the more immature KG-1 myeloblasts, concentrations of TNF alpha greater than 10 U/mL synergistically interacted with RA to inhibit clonal growth; at lower concentrations of TNF alpha (less than 10 U/mL), RA appeared to inhibit the expected effect of TNF alpha. KG-1 cells were not induced to differentiate with either agent alone or in combination. With four of nine leukemic patients, TNF alpha in combination with RA (10(-7) mol/L) inhibited leukemic clonal growth to a greater extent than each agent alone. No marked effect of the combined treatment was seen in two other patients. The RA reversed the inhibitory action of TNF alpha on normal human granulocyte-macrophage colony forming cells (GM-CFC) and on clonal growth of leukemic cells from three patients. Our study suggests that TNF alpha and RA interact in a complex manner with normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells.\r"

These included congenital conditions, inflammatory and allergic sinus disease, fungus infection, and both necrotising and non-necrotising granulomas. A variety of benign and malignant tumours have been investigated, including eight examples of juvenile angiofibroma and 19 malignant sinus tumours. This experience of magnetic resonance scanning has shown that it is superior to computed tomography in showing the extent of malignant disease and, provided the correct pulse sequences are employed, it is always possible to distinguish tumour from retained secretion or inflamed mucosa. The extent of intracranial invasion can also be optimally demonstrated. One of the advantages of the method is the direct three-plane imaging and multislice technique, which gives total coverage of the head and neck for the assessment of malignant disease. Tissue diagnosis in the paranasal sinuses is less important than the demonstration of tumour extent and distribution. Only one tumour (juvenile angiofibroma) showed diagnostic spin-sequence characteristics, and no differentiation was observed between malignant tumours of epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The major drawback of magnetic resonance is the poor demonstration of bone and calcification in the sinuses, so that in some patients the scans need to be augmented by computed tomography studies.\r"

Although most patients with erythroid EL were elderly men, 20% of the cases occurred in the under-3 age group, where boys and girls were equally affected. Chromosomes 5 and 7 were found to be lost or partially deleted in two thirds of the adult patients only, but not in the pediatric patients; this suggests that EL is associated with cumulative mutagen exposure in adult patients only. It is proposed that cytogenetic criteria may be of use prospectively in distinguishing patients with erythroid EL from those with myeloid EL.\r"

Patients clinically suspected of osteonecrosis had a statistically significant increased incidence of Type 2 lesions. Three patients with a BM relapse also showed Type 2 lesions. Circumscript lesions of the epiphyses were seen exclusively in the four patients with clinical suspicion of osteonecrosis during BM remission and this may be a MR finding strongly indicative of osteonecrosis. Patients with Type 2 lesions during BM remission had received systemic chemotherapy for a statistically significant longer period than the other patients. Using MRI findings we suspect that at least four patients suffered osteonecrosis due to chemotherapy. MRI is a promising means of detecting this disorder.\r"

The linear regression analysis of dose-steady state concentration relationship revealed that relapsed children had significantly lower steady state concentration of MTX (faster systemic clearance) than those who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR), whatever dosage of the drug was given. Relapsed children (n = 25) had a systemic clearance of MTX 122.5 +/- 55.5 ml/minute/m2 versus 71.8 +/- 25.8 ml/minute/m2 found in the CCR patients (n = 33) when the dosage of MTX was 0.5 to 1.0 g/m2. When the dose was 6.0 to 8.0 g/m2 the clearance values were 93.27 +/- 32.6 versus 61.8 +/- 24.5 ml/minute/m2, respectively. The differences are statistically significant (P less than 0.001). In 16 of 25 relapsed patients (64%) an increase of the systemic clearance has been observed during the consecutive treatments, but only 4/33 CCR patients (12%) has expressed such a phenomenon. The dose-independent prognostic relevance of systemic clearance of MTX as a possible sign of resistance to MTX is concluded.\r"

Thirty (10%) died as a result of hemorrhage and/or leukostasis prior to or in the first 12 days of therapy. The risk of early death due to hemorrhage and/or leukostasis is significantly greater when certain features are initially present: acute monocytic leukemia (French-American-British [FAB] M5), hyperleukocytosis (greater than or equal to 100,000/microliter), and extramedullary organ involvement (P less than 0.001). The risk increases sharply when these factors exist in combination: 72% mortality with FAB M5 and hyperleukocytosis, and 43% with FAB M5 and extramedullary organ involvement. In 11 patients leukostasis alone or in combination with hemorrhage was probably the cause of death during the first 3 days after diagnosis. All 11 children presented with hyperleukocytosis and were classified as monocytic subtype FAB M4 or M5. After induction, a close temporal association between rapid blast reduction and occurrence of fatal hemorrhage was established in five patients. Thrombocytopenic hemorrhages were controllable and, therefore, responsible for death only in exceptional cases. It is difficult to avoid these early fatal complications with current therapeutic measures. Early exchange transfusion together with special supportive care may be useful.\r"

Twenty infants received both conventional endotracheal suctioning and suctioning by the new catheter. The infants had a maximal change from a presuctioning transcutaneous oxygen (PtcO2) of 12 +/- 8 torr and required 3.1 +/- 2 min to regain their presuctioning oxygenation level compared to a maximal change of 21 +/- 10 torr (p less than .05) and a stabilization time of 5.3 +/- 2.6 min (p less than .05) in the conventionally treated group. Three study infants experienced an abnormal PtcO2 (either less than 40 or greater than 90 torr), while 13 control infants suffered these abnormalities (p less than .01). The use of this new suction device effectively reduced the exposure of this group of infants to episodes of aberrant oxygen states and allowed for a shorter recovery time.\r"

  ".U": "88054819\r", 
  ".W": "The effect of several prostaglandins (PGs) on osteoblastic cells was investigated using clone MC3T3-E1 under serum-free conditions. PGA1, A2, B1, and B2 had little effect on intracellular cAMP, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and DNA synthesis in the cells. At 4-2000 ng/ml, PGE1 among PG analogs tested had a dose-dependent stimulatory effect on ALP activity in the cells, and this effect was amplified by isobutyl methylxanthine. Also, PGE1 strongly augmented the amount of intracellular cAMP over the same concentration range. However, PGE1 had little effect on ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis, and at high doses it rather depressed DNA synthesis. Furthermore, PGE1 did not affect the intracellular cGMP level. The effect of PGE1 on the cells closely mimics that of forskolin, suggesting that the PG stimulates the differentiation of the osteoblastic cells predominantly via the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. In contrast with PGE1, PGF2 alpha strongly increased ornithine decarboxylase activity and DNA synthesis in the cells in a dose-related fashion at low concentrations (4-100 ng/ml), at which concentrations it had little effect on the intracellular cAMP or cGMP level and depressed ALP activity. Moreover, PGF2 alpha depressed the stimulatory effect of PGE1 on ALP activity but did not affect the elevation of cAMP level by PGE1. The accumulation of inositol phosphates was greatly increased by PGF2 alpha in the concentration range effective in stimulating DNA synthesis, but was increased little by PGE1, suggesting that PGF2 alpha is a potent stimulator of phosphatidyl inositol turnover in the cells. In addition, A23187, a Ca ionophore, alone did not influence the DNA synthesis, but the effects of tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate, a direct activator of protein kinase C, were very similar to those of PGF2 alpha. Moreover, the stimulation of DNA synthesis or the inhibition of ALP activity by PGF2 alpha was partially counteracted by H-7, a strong inhibitor of protein kinase C. These results suggest that PGF2 alpha stimulates the proliferation of osteoblastic cells predominantly through the phosphatidyl inositol turnover system following in part the activation of protein kinase C. Our data presented here indicate that PGE1 and PGF2 alpha are closely involved in the differentiation and proliferation, respectively, of osteoblasts in vitro and that their action may be mediated by second messengers which differ from each other.\r"

A significant increase in bicarbonate output occurred from 258 +/- 38 mumol/30 min during the basal period to 531 +/- 86 mumol/30 min after return of the intragastric pH to neutral (p less than 0.05). Prostaglandin E2 output also increased significantly from 410 +/- 136 pmol/30 min to 1002 +/- 194 pmol/30 min (p less than 0.05). The changes were caused mainly by an increase in gastric secretory volume with only non-significant increases in concentrations of bicarbonate and prostaglandin E2. The results suggest that mechanisms exist to adjust the rate of gastric bicarbonate secretion to the prevailing intraluminal pH and that this may occur through the release of prostaglandin E2.\r"

Equilibrium dialysis of the rectum in patients with ulcerative colitis was used to determine whether cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase products released from the inflamed rectal mucosa could be differentially inhibited by systemic treatment with prednisolone and indomethacin, respectively. In 10 patients with severe disease luminal concentrations of prostaglandin E2, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and leucotriene B4 were markedly raised (p less than 0.05) on comparison with 10 healthy controls, and they decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) within 72 hours after administration of prednisolone 1.5 mg/kg/day orally. In contrast prostaglandin, but not leucotriene B4 concentrations decreased (p less than 0.05) within 72 hours after administration of indomethacin 150 mg/day in another 10 patients with distal disease. These prompt reductions in concentrations of arachidonic acid metabolites more likely are caused by direct drug actions, rather than being secondary to decreased tissue damage. The data accord with the theory explaining anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids through lipocortin activity and support the belief that leucotrienes are more important than prostaglandins as mediators of inflammation in ulcerative colitis.\r"

  ".U": "88059605\r", 
  ".W": "Apolipoprotein E (apo E) plays an important role in receptor mediated clearance of lipoprotein particles from plasma. Common genetic variation in apo E exists with three alleles coding for proteins called E2, E3, and E4. In in vitro receptor binding assays, E2 binds poorly, whereas E3 and E4 function normally. Recently, the apo E phenotype has been shown to have an effect on low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with levels in subjects with E2 lower and E4 higher than E3. We have examined the effect of the apo E polymorphism on dietary fat clearance using the vitamin A-fat loading test, which specifically labels intestinally derived lipoproteins with retinyl palmitate (RP). 27 normal subjects were studied, 10 with E3/3, 9 with E3/2, 7 with E4/3, and 1 with E4/4. After a vitamin A-containing fatty meal, postprandial RP concentrations were measured in chylomicron (Sf greater than 1,000) and nonchylomicron (Sf less than 1,000) fractions for 14 h. Compared with E3/3 subjects, E3/2 subjects had a significantly higher nonchylomicron RP concentration (P less than 0.05) (peak heights and areas below the curves) indicating slower clearance and the E4/3, E4/4 group had a significantly lower nonchylomicron RP concentration (P less than 0.05) indicating faster clearance. The clearance in the latter group was twice that of E3/2 subjects (P less than 0.01). Thus, heterozygosity for the defective form of apo E, E2, delays, and the surprising presence of a functionally normal allele, E4, increases clearance. This apo E effect on exogenous fat clearance may explain the recently described effect of the apo E phenotypes on LDL cholesterol levels.\r"

Most of the family members have dysfunctions in the central nervous system, in addition to typical symptoms of type I FAP. The transthyretin (TTR, also called prealbumin) gene of the atypical FAP(FAP-IY) was analyzed with recombinant DNA techniques and a RIA method. FAP-IY was found to have the mutation responsible for the methionine-for-valine substitution at position 30 of TTR, as in the case of typical type I FAP. However, analysis of DNA polymorphisms in the TTR locus showed that FAP-IY has a genetic background differing from that of the typical type I FAP. These observations lead to the consideration that a genetic factor(s) involved in the dysfunction of the central nervous system may locate in a chromosome region in close proximity to the TTR gene.\r"

We isolated several cDNA clones by screening a HEL cell cDNA library with an oligonucleotide derived from amino acid sequence of GPIIb. Nucleotide and amino acid sequences were determined from 703 bp of one of these clones. Amino acid sequence of purified platelet GPIIb peptides confirmed the identity of the clone. The cDNA encodes the carboxyl terminus of the large (alpha) subunit of GPIIb and all of the smaller (beta) subunit of GPIIb. By hybridizing the cDNA directly to chromosomes separated by dual laser chromosome sorting, the gene for GPIIb was mapped to chromosome 17. Northern blot analysis showed a approximately 3.4-kb GPIIb mRNA in HEL cells. We also compared the amino acid sequences determined from eight additional platelet GPIIb peptides with the derived amino acids from a published HEL cell GPIIb cDNA, and the platelet and HEL cell proteins appear to be the same. Despite previous reports that vascular endothelial cells and monocytes contain GPIIb, no GPIIb mRNA was observed in either type of cell. Thus, GPIIb appears to be specific for the platelet-megakaryocyte membrane and is distinct from the alpha subunits of the adhesion receptors in other normal tissues.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in the activities of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinases in response to prostaglandin (PG)E2-induced elevation of intracellular cAMP level were investigated with a murine macrophage-like cell line, P388D1. Photoaffinity labeling with 8-azido-[32P]cAMP showed that untreated P388D1 cells possess two types of cAMP-binding proteins of m.w. 49,000 and 52,000, respectively, in the cytosol fraction in a ration of 1:8. They must represent regulatory subunits (RI and RII, respectively) of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, because affinity chromatography on a column of omega-aminohexyl-agarose of the cytosol fraction clearly separated two fractions that exhibited the enzymatic activities and cAMP-binding activities. Photoaffinity labeling of these fractions with 8-azido-[32P]cAMP confirmed the separation of two types of isoenzymes, because each cAMP-dependent protein kinase active fraction was associated with only one type of regulatory subunit. The exposure of P388D1 cells to exogenously added PGE2 (1 microM) caused about 7.5-fold increase in the intracellular cAMP level within 30 sec. The cAMP level then sharply dropped to about 100 pmol/10(7) cells, remained at this level for about 20 min, and then gradually increased to 200 pmol/10(7) (about fivefold over the control). The enzyme assay of the cytosol demonstrated that the activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinases closely follows the kinetics of the intracellular cAMP level. The activation of the enzyme was specific for PGE2 and was not triggered by 1 microM PGF2 alpha or PGD2 which have been shown to be unable to activate adenylate cyclase of P388D1 cells. The PGE2-induced increase in the intracellular cAMP level appeared to activate preferentially the type I isoenzyme, inasmuch as the enzymatic activity of this type separated by the affinity chromatography of the cytosol of PGE2-exposed cells was lower in the presence than in the absence of cAMP, whereas the type II enzyme activity remained responsive to exogenously added cAMP.\r"

Serum from HIV-infected, but not uninfected, donors significantly augmented cytolysis of virus-infected targets (P less than .005). There was no augmented killing of uninfected H9 cells with sera from either group.

Purified human heart and liver ferritins were labeled with iodine 125 and incubated with K562 cells at 37 degrees C. Specific uptake was calculated from the reduction in labeled ferritin binding in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ferritin. Specific uptake of 125I-labeled heart ferritin increased progressively, reaching a maximum after 2 to 3 hours' incubation, although nonspecific binding was too high to derive an affinity constant. There was no specific binding with 125I-labeled liver ferritin, and K562 cells bound neither 125I-labeled human serum albumin nor free 125I. Uptake of heart ferritin was negligible at 4 degrees C and was sharply reduced in the presence of 10% human plasma or fetal calf serum. There was no apparent relationship between the number of days of subculture and the level of uptake of acidic isoferritins by whole cells. These studies demonstrate a selective binding mechanism for acidic isoferritins on erythroleukemia cells and imply that these isoferritins have additional functions besides the storage of iron.\r"

  ".W": "Nine children with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JCML) were diagnosed in an 8-year period from 1977 to 1984. The clinical courses and outcomes of five patients who received minimal or no chemotherapy were compared with that of four patients who were treated with intensive acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) combination chemotherapy. None of the five patients in the former group achieved clinical remission and their survivals were 1, 4, 4, 7, and 29 months, respectively. All four patients in the latter group achieved clinical remissions that lasted 11, 21, 21, and 27 + months, respectively. The durations of their survival (21, 26, 30, and 32 + months) were significantly better than the five patients who received minimal or no chemotherapy (P less than .05). Despite hospitalizations for chemotherapy and for treatment of chemotherapy-associated complications, the clinical status and quality of life of the children who achieved clinical remission were superior to those who remained in relapse. Although intensive chemotherapy induced lengthy remissions, three of the four patients have relapsed. Cytogenetic and cell culture data indicated that the monocytic-macrophage cells characteristic of JCML appeared to be suppressed during remission rather than totally eliminated. We recommend that ANLL-type combination chemotherapy be used as the initial treatment of JCML because of its promptness in effecting clinical remissions. Improved maintenance and consolidation protocols have to be developed to produce durable remissions and cures. Alternatively, bone marrow transplantation may be a useful option soon after remission is achieved with chemotherapy.\r"

Decision matrix analysis of 58 different nonimmunosuppressed patients resulted in 93% sensitivity and 76% specificity. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the ideal index cutoff was 50.

To define further the biological activity of 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2, with respect to kidney function, studies were conducted in anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats prepared for renal clearance measurements. Intravenous infusion of highly-purified 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 (2.5 micrograms/min, n = 9) elevated urine flow (28 +/- 6 microliter/min, P less than .05), urinary sodium/potassium (0.96 +/- 0.31, P less than .05), hematocrit (0.5 +/- 0.3, volumes/100 ml, P less than .05) and urinary sodium excretion (2.3 +/- 1.0 microEq/min). Similar responses but of greater magnitude were obtained with PGF2 alpha (2.5 micrograms/min). Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were unaffected. In contrast, PGD2 (2.5 micrograms/min) resulted in decreases in MAP and concomitant reductions in GFR, urine flow and sodium excretion. Abrupt and pronounced increases in urine flow and sodium excretion were observed on administration of 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 at 7.5 micrograms/min. 9 alpha, 11 beta-PGF2 (2.5 micrograms/min) produced consistent increases in urine flow and the excretion of sodium and chloride in rats treated with meclofenamate, 2 mg/kg/hr i.v., indicating that these responses were not dependent on endogenous PG synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In vitro (R)- and (S)-Thiorphan were almost equipotent in inhibiting enkephalinase activity (Ki, 1.7 and 2.2 nM, respectively) or thermolysin activity (Ki, 13 and 6 microM, respectively) whereas the (R)-isomer was 44-fold less potent than the (S)-isomer on ACE activity (Ki 4800 and 110 nM, respectively). When tested on slices of rat globus pallidus in the presence of bestatin, to block the aminopeptidase pathway of enkephalin degradation, both Thiorphan enantiomers ensured a complete protection of endogenous (Met5)enkephalin released by depolarization and a suppression of the increase in the extracellular levels of Tyr-Gly-Gly, a characteristic enkephalin metabolite. These two effects occurred at EC50 values of the two enantiomers (10 nM in both cases), consistent with the idea that they were due to enkephalinase inhibition. After i.v. administration of the acetorphan enantiomers to mice, the enkephalinase activity of a rapidly prepared striatal membrane fraction was reduced in a dose-dependent manner with similar \"ex vivo\" ED50 values (1.0 and 0.3 mg/kg for the (R)- and (S)-isomer, respectively). In contrast the ACE activity of the same preparation was reduced in a significant manner only by (S)-acetorphan (ED50 value of 11 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The influence of the dopaminergic system on the striatonigral tachykinin pathway was studied in male Fischer 344 rats. Activation of dopamine receptors by subacute administration of apomorphine (APO; 5 mg/kg s.c. twice daily for 7 days) significantly increased striatonigral substance P-like immunoreactivity (SP-LI; 73% over control in striatum, 63% over control in substantia nigra) and substance K-like immunoreactivity (49% over control in striatum, 15% over control in substantia nigra). The changes in striatonigral SP-LI were dose dependent (0.5-5 mg/kg), time related (one, three or seven daily injections) and region specific as changes were not observed in frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypothalamus. The increase of SP-LI and substance K-like immunoreactivity was completely prevented by the dopamine receptor blocker, haloperidol, which, by itself, caused a slight decrease of both peptide levels. Immunocytochemical staining revealed enhanced SP-LI in neurons restricted to striatal patches and fibers in substantia nigra pars reticulata after APO treatment as compared with SP-LI intensity in control. In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the APO-induced increase in the level of tachykinins, the abundance of messenger RNA coding for preprotachykinin was quantified by blot hybridization. It was found that subacute administration of APO increased the abundance of preprotachykinin messenger RNA in the striatum. These results suggest that stimulation of dopaminergic receptors leads to an acceleration of tachykinin biosynthesis. A single dose of APO (2.5 mg/kg s.c.) induced a slight but significant reduction in striatal SP-LI (82% of control). This result suggests that APO triggers the release of tachykinins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To that effect, weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed for 8-12 weeks either a nutritionally adequate liquid diet containing a standard amount of vitamin A or a diet lacking vitamin A. Littermates were pair-fed the same diets with ethanol (36% of total calories) isocalorically replacing part of the carbohydrates. In rats fed the vitamin A-deficient diets with or without ethanol, plasma vitamin A was very low (5.3 +/- 0.9 and 5.9 +/- 1.5 micrograms/dl; n = 20 pairs), while liver and tracheal vitamin A was unmeasurable. Squamous metaplasia was noted in 9 of 20 rats fed the vitamin A-deficient diet and in 13 of 20 rats fed the same diet plus ethanol. Severe lesions (those showing keratinization) were present in 42% of the tracheal sections from rats fed the vitamin A-deficient diet plus ethanol compared to 6% of the sections from rats fed the diet without ethanol (P less than .001). In the ethanol-fed group, 37% of all the sections showed metaplasia occupying more than 50% of the tracheal epithelium, whereas in the absence of ethanol, 14% of the sections had lesions occupying more than 50% of the epithelium (P less than .001). When the histologic grade and extent of the lesions were expressed as the percentage of rats affected, the differences between the 2 groups of animals were not statistically significant. Ethanol feeding resulted in a 70% increase in the labeling index of basal cells in squamous metaplasia (30.7 +/- 3.5 vs. 17.3 +/- 1.5%; P less than .02). The number of [3H]thymidine-labeled suprabasal cells was not altered after ethanol feeding. In ciliated cells of the tracheal epithelium that were not as yet involved in the formation of metaplasia, ciliary abnormalities and an increased number of lysosomes were observed in rats that had consumed ethanol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effector mechanisms evoked in tumor-bearing rats following a single injection of the avirulent Su strain of type 3, group A Streptococcus pyogenes (OK-432) were sequentially examined. F344 rats challenged ip with a lethal dose of the syngeneic MADB106 mammary carcinoma could survive more than 100 days when given 50 mg OK-432/kg ip 1 day after tumor challenge. When the responsible effector mechanisms were examined in this therapeutic model, two distinct effector phases distinguished by the number of tumor cells were evident. Phase I, 1-6 days following OK-432 injection, resulted in a sharp decrease in tumor cell numbers and was related to the direct antitumor cytotoxicity of OK-432 and was coincident with an increase in the number of polymorphonuclear neutrophils. However, by day 6 a sharp increase in tumor cell numbers was again observed. Subsequently, a second phase of tumor cell destruction was observed 7-20 days following OK-432 injection and was reflected in a strong lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity response as well as the production of complement-dependent cytotoxic antibody against the MADB106 tumor cells. Further, the adoptive transfer of either peritoneal exudate cells or sera from the phase II animals revealed that both factors may be responsible for the antitumor activity observed in this therapeutic model. In conclusion, this study has demonstrated that the antitumor effects seen with OK-432 are due to a combination of sequential effector mechanisms leading to the eventual rejection of established tumor.\r"

The cultured cells were found by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method to express amylase and ultrastructurally to have secretory granules showing positive immunoreaction with anti-amylase serum. In addition, the cells were found to secrete amylase into the culture medium. The expression of VIP in the cultured cells was observed by the PAP method, immunofluorescent staining method, or immunoelectron microscopy. Moreover, the presence of the polypeptide reactive to antibodies directed against VIP in the cultured cells was confirmed by immunoblotting and radioimmunoassay. These findings indicate that the cells proliferating in culture express both amylase and VIP.\r"

Both methionine- and leucine-enkephalin were detected in tumor tissue by immunocytochemistry, with immunoreactivity related to the cortical cytoplasm of tumor cells, but not to cell nuclei. Endogenous opioids and receptors were found in benign and malignant tumors representative of ectodermal, mesodermal, and endodermal origin. Receptors and endogenous opioid peptides were present in tumors from many different species, including those transplanted into nude mice. These results suggest that opioid receptors and endogenous opioids are fundamental features of human and animal cancers.\r"

  ".W": "Platelet involvement during tumor cell adhesion to subendothelial matrix was examined in vitro. Platelets were subjected to thrombin stimulation and mechanical lysis and examined for their effects on tumor cell adhesion. These treatments altered the platelet ultrastructure and cytoskeletal integrity. Untreated washed rat platelets (WRP) exhibited extensive adhesion to and spreading on substrates and substantially enhanced tumor cell adhesion to the same substrates (i.e., 250% greater than tumor cells without platelets). Thrombin prestimulation of platelets limited platelet adhesion and spreading and platelet facilitation of tumor cell adhesion. Complete mechanical lysis disrupted both the platelet membrane and the cytoskeleton and eliminated the ability of platelets to adhere or to enhance tumor cell adhesion. Partially lysed platelets resembled membrane ghosts and facilitated tumor cell adhesion by a mechanism independent of spreading and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Fractionation studies indicated that platelet cytoskeletal components played a role in the adhesion process. Pretreatment of WRP with cytochalasin A or B dose dependently inhibited microfilament-mediated platelet spreading and platelet-enhanced tumor cell adhesion. Colchicine and vinblastine induced microtubule depolymerization, but they had no observable effect on platelet spreading or platelet-enhanced tumor cell adhesion. It was concluded that platelet-enhanced tumor cell adhesion to subendothelial matrix depends on an intact platelet cytoskeleton and on a platelet membrane component(s) and is mediated by surface contact between platelets and tumor cells. Furthermore, platelet-mediated tumor cell adhesion to subendothelial matrix may involve two mechanisms: one dependent on, and one independent of, platelet spreading and cytoskeletal rearrangement.\r"

MAb anti-2H9 induced specific modulation of the corresponding antigen (Ag) from the cell surface. Cell-bound anti-2H9 antibody (Ab)-Ag complexes rapidly disappeared during incubation of cells at 37 degrees C for 2-4 hours. This early loss was followed by reappearance of the Ag on the cell surface within 4-12 hours. In contrast, anti-HeFi-1 and anti-IRac bound avidly to the surface of RS cells and persisted for more than 3 days. During this period, there were no significant changes in the expression of HeFi-1 or IRac Ag on the surface of tumor cells. Cell surface-bound Abs were distributed uniformly, and there was no evidence of microaggregation, as determined by electron microscopy. None of the 3 MAbs was directly cytotoxic or exhibited complement-mediated cytotoxicity. On the basis of these findings (persistence of anti-HeFi-1 and anti-IRac on the cell surface), these 2 MAbs may be suitable for immunoimaging and immunotherapy for Hodgkin's disease.\r"

The mean and variance of the numbers of resultant B16 F1 and B16 F10 melanoma metastases strongly correlated with the power function (r2 greater than 0.8). The exponent b was 1.4 +/- 0.1 and 1.6 +/- 0.2 for the F1 and F10 melanomas, respectively, indicating a clustering of metastases within certain mice.

The induction of esophageal cancer was enhanced by TPA given in drinking water after AMN administration; i.e., the incidence of developing esophageal cancers and the multiplicity (number of esophageal cancers per rat) were significantly higher in groups given TPA solution orally after an oral administration of AMN than in those given the AMN solution alone. The enhancement of carcinogenesis with TPA was not affected by the interval between the administration of AMN and the administration of TPA. However, pretreatment with TPA before AMN administration did not enhance the induction of esophageal cancer. Neoplasms were not detected in groups given only TPA or tap water. Because this approach is similar to the phenomenon of two-stage carcinogenesis in the skin, it should provide a meaningful experimental model for studying two-stage carcinogenesis in the esophagus.\r"

They also received 8 weekly sc injections of DMH. The experiment was divided into two time periods: a) from 5 weeks before the first injection until 3 days after the last one (initiation period), and b) the subsequent 19.5 weeks until sacrifice of the mice (promotion period). Selenium had a strong protective effect when given during the initiation period; adenomas were reduced to a much greater extent than adenocarcinomas. The only effect of selenium supplementation in the promotion period was a small decrease in adenomas. Cabbage apparently had two opposing actions. It increased tumor incidence, particularly adenocarcinomas, if given in the initiation period, but it reduced adenoma formation considerably when given in the promotion period.\r"

  ".W": "This study addressed the question of whether hypercorticism in tumor-bearing animals contributes to the wasting of body fat and lean body mass, particularly that of skeletal muscles. For this purpose, hydrocortisone-substituted nongrowing sarcoma-bearing and control C57BL/6J mice were used that were either adrenalectomized or sham-operated prior to experimentation. Adrenalectomy in itself did not alter food intake or body composition in normal animals. Tumor-bearing mice and pair-weighted control animals had elevated urinary excretion of corticosteroids compared with the urinary excretion in freely fed controls. The malignant tumor induced the well-recognized wasting in tumor-bearing animals, irrespective of the presence of the adrenal glands. Therefore, an elevated corticosteroid production did not account for the wasting of body fat, lean body mass, skeletal muscle proteins, or decreased RNA activity in quadriceps muscles from tumor-bearing animals, although such muscles were sensitive to physiologic doses of injected hydrocortisone (20 micrograms/day). Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity in liver tissue from tumor-bearing animals was higher than that induced by pharmacologic doses of hydrocortisone in normal animals. Physiologic doses of hydrocortisone induced hepatic TAT activity, but pair-weighed control animals with the same degree of hypercorticism as was found in tumor-bearing animals had normal TAT activity in liver tissue. Although hypercorticism is present in tumor-bearing animals, the results demonstrate that cancer cachexia can start and proceed independently of the adrenal glands. Therefore, adrenal hyperfunction is not the proximate cause for the development of experimental cancer cachexia induced by anorexia.\r"

The urinary bladder tumors were transitional cell carcinomas, keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas, and sarcomas. Papillomas of the urinary bladder were found in 4 rats in the control group.

Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) analysis of the full \"any acid exposure\" cohort (n = 1,165), with the use of U.S. death rates as a standard, showed that lung cancer was significantly elevated, with a mortality ratio of 1.64 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.14-2.28, based on 35 observed deaths]. The lung cancer mortality ratio for workers exposed only to sulfuric acid (n = 722) was lower (SMR = 1.39), but further restriction to the time 20 years and more from first employment in a job with probable daily sulfuric acid exposure (approximately equal to 0.2 mg/m3) yielded a mortality ratio of 1.93 (95% CI = 1.10-3.13). An excess lung cancer risk was also seen in workers exposed to acids other than sulfuric acid (SMR = 2.24; 95% CI = 1.02-2.46). When comparison was made to other steel workers (rather than to the U.S. general population) to control for socioeconomic and life-style factors such as smoking, the largest lung cancer excess was again seen in workers exposed to acids other than sulfuric acid (SMR = 2.00; 95% CI = 1.06-3.78). Adjustment for potential differences in smoking habits showed that increased smoking was unlikely to have entirely explained the increased risk. Mortality from causes of death other than lung cancer was unremarkable, with the exception of significantly low rates for deaths due to digestive system diseases.\r"

  ".U": "88063787\r", 
  ".W": "The expression of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen class II antigens on gastric epithelia and gastric carcinoma (GaCa) was studied with the use of murine monoclonal antibodies to DR, DQ, and DP antigens. DR and DP antigens but not DQ antigens were demonstrated in fundic glands of normal gastric epithelia, and DP+ cells were located in part of the DR+ epithelia. Of 15 GaCas examined, 11 expressed DR antigen, and the degree of the expression varied considerably among the specimens. DP antigen was found in 3 of the 11 DR+ carcinomas, and the DQ antigen was found in one of the 3 DR+ DP+ specimens. Thus the expression of class II antigens in normal gastric epithelia and GaCas appears to be in the order of DR, DP, and DQ. Studies on 3 GaCa cell lines (Kato III, MKN28, and MKN45) demonstrated that 1 line (Kato III) expressed DR antigen only, and the remaining lines were negative. Interferon (IFN)-gamma treatment enhanced the expression of DR antigen on Kato III cells and induced expression of DQ and DP antigens. The IFN-gamma treatment also induced expression of DR antigen but not DQ or DP antigens in 1 of the 2 negative cell lines. The induction of the class II antigens by IFN-gamma was shown to be dose dependent. However, maximal induction of DQ and DP antigens on the Kato III cells and DR antigens on MKN45 cells required 10 times more IFN-gamma than that needed for the maximal expression of DR antigen on Kato III. Northern blot analyses of cytoplasmic RNA from these cells were in agreement with and affirmed the above-described expression of the class II antigens on the cell lines. The DR antigen on the Kato III cells was capable of stimulating allogeneic lymphocytes in MLR, and its stimulatory activity was significantly enhanced by IFN-gamma. These results demonstrated a differential expression of class II antigens in the \"DR, DP, and DQ order\" in normal gastric epithelia, GaCa cells, and GaCa cell lines, suggesting different mechanisms acting discordantly on the expression of each of these antigens and that the DR antigen on the GaCa cell lines possesses MLR-stimulatory ability.\r"

  ".W": "A new DNA virus, designated \"human B lymphotropic virus\" or \"human herpesvirus 6\" (HBLV), has been isolated from the peripheral blood leukocytes of patients with various lymphoproliferative disorders, in some instances also associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) infection. HBLV, propagated in vitro in human cord blood lymphocytes, was found to be ultrastructurally similar to members of the herpesvirus family. It is an enveloped virus with an icosahedral nucleocapsid made up of 162 capsomeres. Unenveloped nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm wee always coated with a tegument, a feature also described for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). However, the nucleoprotein core of HBLV does not have the beaded appearance as that of HCMV, nor do HBLV-infected cells contain the skein-like structure. Immune electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of specific antibodies to viral envelope and internal antigens in sera of infected patients, indicating that this virus is a possible human pathogen. These and previously reported characteristics are consistent with the HBLV being a new and unique DNA virus morphologically belonging to the herpesvirus family.\r"

Murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were raised against CSAp that was affinity purified with goat polyclonal antibodies from GW-39 human colonic carcinoma xenografts or against the CSAp-producing colon cancer cell line SW-948. Two of the MAbs, designated Mu-2 and Mu-4, recognized a CSAp determinant containing sialic acid, and this epitope was also expressed on bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM). Blocking experiments demonstrated that the Mu-2 and Mu-4 MAbs recognized different determinants. A third MAb, Mu-3, did not cross-react with BSM, but unlike Mu-2 and Mu-4, it did react with human saliva. Reactivity of Mu-3 with saliva did not correlate with major blood group and Lewis-related secretory blood group substances in saliva. This reactivity was not related to sialylated Lewis activity. The fourth antibody, Mu-1, appeared to react with a conformational determinant since its epitope was destroyed by heat treatment or thiol reduction. Enzyme immunoassays have demonstrated that all four epitopes may be expressed on one molecular species.\r"

After adjustment for the factors found to be related to the various estrogen measures, estrogen levels in women with benign and malignant disease were compared to those of controls. Findings were as follows: a) little evidence of any relation of most breast cancer risk factors with the various serum estrogen parameters studied; b) differences in breast fluid estrogen levels that may be relevant to the protective effect of parity on breast cancer risk; c) markedly higher levels of E2 and E1 in breast fluid than in serum and no evidence of a correlation of serum with breast fluid measures; d) no support for the hypothesis that breast cancer patients have higher serum percent free E2 than controls or women with benign breast disease; and e) higher breast fluid E2 and E1 levels in women with biopsied benign breast disease than in controls.\r"

Satisfactory smears were obtained from 96.4% of the persons screened. The technique used was rapid, simple, inexpensive, safe, and effective in the determination of the prevalence of dysplasia and early carcinoma and the progression rate of dysplasia to carcinoma. In the high-risk area, precursor lesions (esophagitis and cellular atypia) were detected in 24% of adults older than 35 years, dysplastic changes in 9%, and carcinoma in 2%. Dysplastic changes were also present in 7% of young adults (25-34 yr of age) and in 1.5% of persons 15-24 years old. Precursor lesions were detected in 16% of the population group between 15 and 24 years old. Dysplastic changes and other precursor lesions were significantly less frequent in the population from the low-risk areas. A total of 14 malignant cases were detected in 8 females and 6 males. Of these, 9 were histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinomas in various stages of differentiation. The progression of dysplastic changes to carcinoma was observed in 5 of the total 14 cases. Three early cancers were successfully treated by esophagectomy. Seasonal variation occurred in the prevalence of mild cytologic changes.\r"

Calculation of relative survival rates (RSs) revealed a consistently more favorable course in women than in men, the 5-year RSs being 80.8 and 68.0% and the 10-year RSs being 75.0 and 61.8%, respectively. Prolonged follow-up and analyses of annual excess mortality showed, in addition, that men surviving about 10 years constituted an apparently cured fraction, whereas among women there was an excess mortality throughout the observation period. The prognosis was increasingly more favorable at younger ages in males, whereas no regular age trend emerged in the female group of patients. A multivariate analysis indicated that the findings were not confounded by temporal trends in RSs or by differences in tumor location between the groups compared and also that the relative hazard was significantly higher for men than for women only during the first 8 years after diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Assay of serum levels of retinol, retinyl palmitate, alpha-carotene, and beta-carotene to assess nutritional status, to trials of retinol and/or beta-carotene to assess nutritional status, to monitor compliance with medication schedules, and to conduct toxicity surveillance. The optimal assay method for clinical trial use represents a balance between analytical power and speed/simplicity. Three such methods were evaluated by means of shared samples between two laboratories. Each method required less than 15 minutes per assay and detected all of the analytes of interest. Careful evaluation of calibration materials and procedures permitted different laboratories using different methods to produce results with an interlaboratory variability smaller than the within-laboratory variability for each separate method. Typical precisions for the analytes in serum samples are: retinol, 0.06 relative standard deviation (RSD; standard deviation divided by mean value); retinyl palmitate, 0.08 RSD; alpha-carotene, 0.15 RSD; and beta-carotene, 0.11 RSD. Application of these methods to several hundred samples indicated that retinyl palmitate and beta-carotene levels were indicative of administered retinol and beta-carotene, whereas retinol itself was not. Population variability in pretreatment serum levels of these micronutrients expressed as RSD (retinol, 0.24; alpha-carotene, 1.11; and beta-carotene, 0.98) far exceeded the analytical imprecision in these determinations, confirming that the present assays could meet the needs of current clinical intervention trials.\r"

Two anti-MATSA monoclonal antibodies (RPH 6 and EB 29) and a rabbit anti-MATSA antiserum were used in indirect fluorescent antibody tests, and cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy and with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Less than 5% MATSA-positive cells were observed in 2 non-MD tumor cell lines (LSCC-RP 9 and RECC-CU 60) with RPH 6, but 7-82% positive cells were observed with EB 29 or the rabbit antiserum. Five MD tumor cell lines (MDCC-CU 2, -CU 14, -CU 25, -CU 32, and -CU 41) had 12-72% positive cells detected with one or both monoclonals and 31-99% positive cells detected with the rabbit antiserum. Over 90% of cells in all MD lines were la and T3 positive, while values for the same parameters in LSCC-RP 9 were 100 and 3% and for RECC-CU 60, 48 and 51%, respectively. Evidence for cell-cycle-dependent expression of MATSA on MDCC-CU 2 was obtained from cell sorting experiments with the FACS and from examination of the MATSA-staining characteristics of 3 clones derived from the parent culture. Less than 5% MATSA-positive cells were observed in uncultured spleen cells from SPF chickens or in spleen cells stimulated for 48 hours with concanavalin A or phytohemagglutinin-M. However, with one exception, 10-53% of normal spleen cells were MATSA positive with RPH 6, after stimulation by mitogen for 24 or 48 hours followed by maintenance in conditioned medium (CM) for various times or after culture directly in CM for 3 days. More limited experiments with rabbit anti-MATSA antiserum yielded 55-85% MATSA-positive cells. From 60 to 97% of these MD virus-free, MATSA-positive cells were la-positive; and, in 2 cases, 89 and 90% were T3 positive.\r"

Differences in response patterns were common among patients and required individualized tailoring of management. Dopamine-blocking neuroleptics were the mainstay of therapy. However, frequent mid-course alterations were required as previously successful drugs stopped working or as their side effects became intolerable. While haloperidol and now pimozide are most frequently used, trifluoperazine and thiothixene can provide superior relief in individual patients. A combination of neuroleptics or even a rotation from one to another may occasionally become necessary. No tardive dyskinesia was encountered in this population. Clonidine proved inferior to neuroleptics in the treatment of the motor and vocal tics, but may have a role in some patients with prominent obsessive-compulsive symptomatology.\r"

It is important to suspect loiasis because this is the only filarial infection that is readily curable; (2) ophthalmologic assessment to diagnose onchocerciasis; (3) if L loa is suspected, thick blood smears should be obtained from midmorning to midafternoon and stained with Giemsa or hematoxylin stains, after a concentration technique is used. Nighttime blood specimens should be obtained if the patient has been in an area where W. bancrofti is prevalent; (4) skin snip biopsies prepared as follows: Bilateral symmetrical skin snips should be taken. In the case of suspected West African filariasis, the pelvic girdle, iliac crest, and back of scapula are thought to have the highest yield. One snip from each of six different sites should be obtained. Each skin snip should be approximately 2 to 3 mm (a cornealoscleral biopsy forceps can be used). Each skin snip is placed in 100 microL (approximately one drop) of normal saline in a flat-bottomed microtiter plate. The plate is incubated at room temperature and checked periodically for 24 hours under a dissecting microscope (X20 to X40). If present, the small worms will be seen wiggling and squirming in the drop of saline; (5) serologic diagnostic methods are most efficient if human filarial antigens are used; (6) if treatment is with diethylcarbamazine, the initial dose should be small.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

There is no evidence of a transition from a 10-nm to a 30-nm fiber. Fiber diameter is correlated with mass per unit length, showing that both increase during condensation. We also find that there is no essential difference between the mass per unit length measured by scanning transmission electron microscopy and neutron scattering in solution, showing that the ordered regions seen in micrographs are representative of chromatin in solution.\r"

When transfecting DNA contained a segment of T. brucei ribosomal DNA that included the 5' end of the rRNA gene, the introduced plasmid directed expression of RNA; this RNA expression was shown both by dot blots and by S1 nuclease protection assays carried out under conditions specific for probe hybridization to RNA. In the absence of the ribosomal region, analogous transcription did not occur. We optimized this trypanosomal expression system with regard to electric shock strength, concentration of input DNA, and incubation time after electric shock. This technique enabling specific trypanosome DNA expression in vivo should facilitate the molecular analysis of T. brucei gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "Acetylcholinesterases (AcChoEases; EC 3.1.1.7) from bovine (Ebo) and human (Ehu) erythrocytes were purified to apparent homogeneity by affinity chromatography. The hydrophobic portion of the glycolipid membrane anchor of each enzyme was radiolabeled with the photoactivated reagent 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine. Several cleavage procedures demonstrated that this radiolabel was highly selective for the fatty acid portion of the anchor in both enzymes. The labeled enzymes were digested with phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-specific phospholipase C (EC 3.1.4.10), and label release was assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. About 85% of the radiolabel was cleaved from Ebo AcChoEase, whereas only 5% was released from Ehu AcChoEase. This finding agrees with a report that Ebo AcChoEase was quantitatively released from intact erythrocytes by PtdIns-specific phospholipase C but Ehu AcChoEase was not [Low, M. G. & Finean, J. B. (1977) FEBS Lett. 82, 143-146]. The two AcChoEases contained comparable amounts of the anchor components ethanolamine, glucosamine, and myo-inositol, but qualitative and quantitative differences were found in the fatty acids. Thin-layer chromatography of radiolabeled fragments generated from Ebo and Ehu AcChoEases by nitrous acid deamination revealed a major difference in the membrane anchors of the two enzymes. The fragment released from Ebo AcChoEase by this procedure comigrated with PtdIns, whereas the corresponding fragment from Ehu AcChoEase had a mobility much greater than that of PtdIns even though it contained myo-inositol and fatty acids. These studies show that 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine is useful for analysis of lipid-containing compounds and indicate that, whereas Ebo AcChoEase contains PtdIns in its glycolipid anchor, Ehu AcChoEase has a different anchor structure, which is resistant to PtdIns-specific phospholipase C. This observation suggests the existence of a class of glycolipid-anchored membrane proteins resistant to this phospholipase.\r"

Virol. 42, 1017-1028] had shown that the N-terminal blocking group exists on all VP4 molecules as well as on VP0 and P1, two precursor polypeptides to VP4 in poliovirus.

Solution of the three-dimensional structure of rabbit muscle aldolase utilized phase information from a single isomorphous Pt(CN)4(2-) derivative, which was combined with iterative-phase refinement based upon the noncrystallographic 222-fold symmetry exhibited by the tetramer subunits. The electron-density map calculated from the refined phases (mf = 0.72) was interpreted on the basis of the known amino acid sequence (363 amino acids per subunit). The molecular architecture of the aldolase subunit corresponds to a singly wound beta-barrel of the parallel alpha/beta class structures as has been observed in triose phosphate isomerase, pyruvate kinase, phosphogluconate aldolase, as well as others. Close contacts between tetramer subunits are virtually all between regions of hydrophobic residues. Contrary to other beta-barrel structures, the known active-site residues are located in the center of the beta-barrel and are accessible to substrate from the COOH side of the beta-barrel. Biochemical and crystallographic data suggest that the COOH-terminal region of aldolase covers the active-site pocket from the COOH side of the beta-barrel and mediates access to the active site. On the basis of sequence studies, active-site residues as well as residues lining the active-site pocket have been totally conserved throughout evolution. By comparison, homology in the COOH-terminal region is minimal. It is suggested that the amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal region may be, in part, the basis for the variable specific activities aldolases exhibit toward their substrates.\r"

While brain ferritin from normal rats contained 42.1 +/- 14.3 mol of aluminum, that from the aluminum-fed group contained 115.4 +/- 48.3 mol of aluminum per mol of ferritin. Liver ferritin from both groups contained similar amounts of both aluminum and iron, and the amounts were less than that found associated with brain ferritin. Ferritin isolated from the brains of patients who died of Alzheimer disease contained more aluminum and more iron than that from age-matched controls. Human brain ferritin is composed of two types of subunits--about 70% heavy chain (Mr, 22,000) and 30% light chain (Mr, 19,500). The isoelectric focusing pattern of human brain ferritin was considerably different from that of human liver. Only 5 of the 20 brain ferritin bands migrated similarly to the acidic isoferritins from the liver, and the major component of brain ferritin, representing 30% of the total ferritin, had a pI of 8.0.\r"

The same 15-base-pair sequence mediates induction by progesterone. Point mutations in the recognition sequence affect inducibility by glucocorticoids and progesterone similarly. Together with the strong conservation of the sequence of the DNA-binding domain of the two receptors, these data suggest that both proteins recognize a sequence that is similar, if not the same.\r"

A comparison of the activity of these recombinants in the four cell lines indicates that the activity of the various enhancer motifs is cell specific.

Recent reports, however, indicate that this class of enzymes may play other roles in cellular metabolism. Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are herein shown to catalyze the AMP----ADP and ADP----ATP exchange reactions (in the absence of tRNAs) by utilizing a transfer of the gamma-phosphate of ATP to reactive AMP and ADP intermediates that are probably the mixed anhydrides of the nucleotide and the corresponding amino acid. AMP and ADP produce active intermediates with amino acids by entering the back-reaction of amino acid activation, reacting with labile covalent amino acid-enzyme intermediates. Gramicidin synthetases 1 and 2, which are known to activate certain amino acids through the formation of intermediate thiol-esters of the amino acids and the enzymes, catalyze the same set of reactions with similar characteristics. Several lines of evidence suggest that these activities are an inherent part of the enzymatic reactions catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and gramicidin synthetases and are not due to impurities of adenylate kinase, NDP kinase, or low levels of tRNAs bound to the enzymes. The covalent amino acid-enzyme adducts are likely intermediates in the aminoacylation of their cognate tRNAs. The use of gramicidin synthetases has thus helped to illuminate mechanistic details of amino acid activation catalyzed by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.\r"

This P-450 isozyme regiospecifically hydroxylates PGE1, PGA1, and PGF2 alpha at carbon-20 (the omega position). The specific activity of this enzyme is induced from 0.07 nmol of 20-OH-PGE1 to 3.05 nmol of 20-OH-PGE1 formed per min per mg of microsomal protein in the lungs of 25- to 28-day pregnant rabbits as compared to nonpregnant rabbits. Immunoblotting studies with a polyclonal antibody raised against this P-450 have shown that there is a concomitant gestational age-dependent increase in the amount of P-450PG-omega microsomal protein accompanying the increase of omega-hydroxylase activities. Within 3 days postpartum, both omega-hydroxylase activity and the amount of immunodetectable P-450PG-omega drop precipitously to near control levels. In vitro translation of total cellular RNA, extracted from the lungs of pregnant rabbits at various days throughout gestation, and immunoprecipitation of newly synthesized P-450PG-omega demonstrated a similar gestational age-dependent increase in translatable P-450PG-omega mRNA, as was observed with omega-hydroxylase activity and P-450PG-omega protein levels. These data suggest that the induction of this P-450 may occur at the transcriptional level and, furthermore, that control of cytochrome P-450PG-omega expression in the rabbit lung is tightly regulated at both protein and mRNA levels.\r"

A group of hydrophobic surfactant-associated proteins has been shown to be essential for rapid surface film formation by surfactant phospholipids. We have purified a hydrophobic surfactant protein of approximately 5 kDa that we term SP5 from bronchopulmonary lavage fluid from a patient with alveolar proteinosis and shown that it promotes rapid surface film formation by simple mixtures of phospholipids. We have derived the full amino acid sequence of human SP5 from the nucleotide sequence of cDNAs identified with oligonucleotide probes based on the NH2-terminal sequence of SP5. SP5 isolated from surfactant is a fragment of a much larger precursor protein (21 kDa). The precursor contains an extremely hydrophobic region of 34 amino acids that comprises most of the mature SP5. This hydrophobicity explains the unusual solubility characteristics of SP5 and the fact that it is lipid-associated when isolated from lung.\r"

  ".W": "Screening of a human placenta lambda gt11 library has led to the isolation of the cDNA for the human beta 1-adrenergic receptor (beta 1AR). Used as the probe was the human genomic clone termed G-21. This clone, which contains an intronless gene for a putative receptor, was previously isolated by virtue of its cross hybridization with the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR). The 2.4-kilobase cDNA for the human beta 1AR encodes a protein of 477 amino acid residues that is 69% homologous with the avian beta AR but only 54% homologous with the human beta 2AR. This suggests that the avian gene encoding beta AR and the human gene encoding beta 1AR evolved from a common ancestral gene. RNA blot analysis indicates a message of 2.5 kilobases in rat tissues, with a pattern of tissue distribution consistent with beta 1AR binding. This pattern is quite distinct from the pattern obtained when the beta 2AR cDNA is used as a probe. Expression of receptor protein in Xenopus laevis oocytes conveys adenylate cyclase responsiveness to catecholamines with a typical beta 1AR specificity. This contrasts with the typical beta 2 subtype specificity observed when the human beta 2AR cDNA is expressed in this system. Mammalian beta 1AR and beta 2AR are thus products of distinct genes, both of which are apparently related to the putative G-21 receptor.\r"

The low-frequency relaxation behavior is shown to result from collisional damping rather than dephasing. Extrapolation of these results to the quasistochastic motion of the heme group in myoglobin provides an explanation of 57Fe Mossbauer spectroscopic data.\r"

  ".W": "A new algorithm is presented for interpreting the hydration dependence of x-ray diffraction measurements. The method assumes that the volume of the hydrocarbon phase of the lipid bilayer is not affected by hydration and that the volume expansion between bilayers at maximum hydration is caused by incorporation of water molecules whose partial molar volume is that of pure bulk water. These simple assumptions lead to a determination of the area expansion (and hence change in hydrocarbon-phase thickness) as a function of hydration. An analysis is made of x-ray data of the L alpha and L beta' phases of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and the L alpha phase of egg phosphatidylcholine. The partial molar volume of water depends critically on the degree of lipid hydration and the presence of voids between the head groups of adjacent lipids. The calculated head-group spacings at minimum hydration are consistent with those obtained from neutron diffraction and indicate that the methyl groups of the choline are almost in contact with corresponding groups in the opposing bilayer. This calls into question the origin of the repulsive forces observed in dehydration experiments.\r"

The distribution and changes of PCN during the mitotic cycle were followed using this antiserum and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Based upon the behavior of PCN during mitosis, it could be differentiated into chromosomal and nonchromosomal portions. During prophase the former gradually associates with the surface of the condensing chromosomes and forms the coat or pellicle around the metaphase and anaphase chromosomes. This pellicle PCN is carried by the anaphase chromosomes to the daughter nuclei. During the time from telophase to interphase, the pellicle PCN dissociates from the decondensing chromosomes and is incorporated into the new nucleoli. The nonchromosomal PCN, after the breakdown of the nuclear membrane, distributes in the cytoplasmic region around the condensed chromosomes and diffuses into the cytoplasm during anaphase. Preliminary biochemical analysis by immunoblotting showed that the PCN consists of two main proteins with molecular masses of 36 kDa and 30 kDa.\r"

(ii) Antibodies epitope-selected by these clones are able to interact with gp110 on electrophoretic transfer blots. (iii) The amino acid sequencing derived from the DNA sequence was confirmed by amino acid sequencing of a tryptic peptide of gp110. Rescreening of the same library with the cDNA clones identified a full-length cDNA clone for this glycoprotein. Sequence analysis indicates that the N-linked carbohydrate chains are concentrated on the N-terminal part of this highly glycosylated protein.\r"

  ".U": "88068517\r", 
  ".W": "We recently isolated, from culture fluids of Staphylococcus aureus, a chemotactic peptide that comprised equimolar quantities of methionine, leucine, phenylalanine, and isoleucine. It interacted with the formylmethionyl peptide receptor of human leukocytes and had considerably higher potency and efficacy than the widely studied tripeptide agonist fMet-Leu-Phe. On the assumption that the attractant was a formylmethionyl tetrapeptide, we synthesized the six possible sequences and tested the products for chemotactic potency and efficacy, as well as their capacity to inhibit binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled fMet-Leu-Phe-Lys to human monocytes. The concentrations required for inhibition of fluorescein-labeled fMet-Leu-Phe-Lys binding by the six peptides covered three orders of magnitude. Chemotactic potency (concentration that caused 50% of the maximum chemotactic response) ranged from 3.1 X 10(-11) M to 6.4 X 10(-10) M; efficacy (percentage of monocytes migrating at optimal attractant concentration) ranged from 41% to 66%. When the six synthetic tetrapeptides were ranked for chemotactic efficacy, they paired according to the position of phenylalanine. The average percentage migration was 66% for the two peptides with phenylalanine in position 3, 51% for phenylalanine in position 4, and 41% for phenylalanine in position 2. Since the published value for the percentage of human monocytes with detectable formyl peptide receptors is 60%, it is apparent that the two tetrapeptides with phenylalanine in position 3 (fMet-Ile-Phe-Leu and fMet-Leu-Phe-Ile) are full chemotactic agonists, which are capable of inducing migration of all the receptor-bearing cells. This is in contrast to the tripeptide fMet-Leu-Phe, which induces migration of only 50% of monocytes with receptors (efficacy of 33%). Since the chemotactic efficacy of the six tetrapeptides covers a wide range, the series may be useful to investigate signals that lead to directed movement after occupancy of receptors by chemoattractants.\r"

Only the human hepatoma cell lines, Hep3B and HepG2, made significant amounts of Epo as measured both by radioimmunoassay and in vitro bioassay (as much as 330 milliunits per 10(6) cells in 24 hr). The constitutive production of Epo increased dramatically as a function of cell density in both cell lines. At cell densities less than 3.3 X 10(5) cells per cm2, there was little constitutive release of Epo in the medium (less than 30 milliunits per 10(6) cells in 24 hr). With Hep3B cells grown at low cell densities, a mean 18-fold increase in Epo expression was seen in response to hypoxia and a 6-fold increase was observed in response to incubation in medium containing 50 microM cobalt(II) chloride. At similar low cell densities, Epo production in HepG2 cells could be enhanced an average of about 3-fold by stimulation with either hypoxia or cobalt(II) chloride. Upon such stimulation, both cell lines demonstrated markedly elevated levels of Epo mRNA. Hence, both Hep3B and HepG2 cell lines provide an excellent in vitro system in which to study the physiological regulation of Epo expression.\r"

S, the stringency of selection upon new mutants, is defined by S = NVm/Vs, where N is the population size and Vm/Vs is a measure of the average fitness decrease experienced by new mutants. The approximation holds both for a \"lonely\" locus, which is the sole provider of genetic variation for the character under selection, and for an \"embedded\" locus, which is not. In both cases I use the Crow and Kimura model of a continuum of alleles with Gaussian selection and mutation. Monte Carlo simulations corroborate the substitution rate formula. Some molecular evolution data suggest the potential utility and limitations of the formula for estimating population size, mutation, and selection parameters. This work agrees with the rest of nearly neutral theory in emphasizing the important role of population size for substitution rates.\r"

Cu/Zn-superoxide superoxide dismutase activity is increased from 1.6- to 6.0-fold in the brains of four transgenic strains and to an equal or lesser extent in several other tissues.
