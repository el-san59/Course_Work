  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of a radiolabeled mouse monoclonal antibody (and its F(ab')2 fragment) against alpha-fetoprotein in the scintigraphic diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-six southern African Blacks and one Caucasian with hepatocellular carcinoma and four patients with other malignant tumors of the liver were studied. Although six hepatocellular carcinomas appeared to selectively concentrate alpha-fetoprotein antibody, one of these tumors was not producing alpha-fetoprotein. Moreover, in another 18 patients with alpha-fetoprotein-producing hepatocellular carcinomas, uptake of alpha-fetoprotein antibody was at best only equal to that in nontumorous hepatic tissue, and three hepatocellular carcinomas that were not producing alpha-fetoprotein concentrated the antibody to the same extent as did the alpha-fetoprotein-producing tumors and hepatic tissue. All four tumors other than hepatocellular carcinoma concentrated alpha-fetoprotein antibody as well as did hepatic tissue. These findings suggest that the penetration of hepatocellular carcinomas by alpha-fetoprotein antibody is a passive and nonselective process. This conclusion is supported by an in vitro study in which a non-alpha-fetoprotein-producing hepatic metastasis took up as much radiolabeled alpha-fetoprotein antibody as did three of four alpha-fetoprotein-producing hepatocellular carcinomas. A likely explanation for the failure of alpha-fetoprotein monoclonal antibody to be selectively concentrated by hepatocellular carcinomas is that alpha-fetoprotein is an export protein and is not expressed on the cell membranes of malignant hepatocytes.\r"

  ".W": "Liver fatty acid binding protein may play a role in the intracellular transport and compartmentation of long-chain fatty acid metabolism. The distribution of liver fatty acid binding protein in the hepatic acinus was determined by means of immunocytochemistry as well as by measurement of liver fatty acid binding protein in cellular protein selectively released from zone 1 and zone 3 cells by means of anterograde and retrograde liver perfusion with digitonin. In untreated male rats, specific immunocytochemical staining for liver fatty acid binding protein showed a declining portal-to-central hepatocellular gradient in intensity, consistent with the portal-to-central ratio of liver fatty acid binding protein abundance measured in effluents from digitonin-perfused livers of 1.6:1. Female and clofibrate-treated male rats, in both of which hepatic synthesis and abundance of liver fatty acid binding protein are greater than in untreated males, differed as well in the pattern of acinar expression of this protein. In females, periportal concentrations of liver fatty acid binding protein determined from the effluent of livers perfused anterograde with digitonin were similar to male values, whereas liver fatty acid binding protein concentration in pericentral hepatocytes determined from the effluent of retrograde perfused livers was increased, resulting in a marked attenuation of the portal-to-central gradient of this protein; this was also apparent on immunocytochemistry. Clofibrate-treated rats, in contrast, displayed a panacinar increase in liver fatty acid binding protein with maintenance of the portal-to-central ratio observed in untreated males. We conclude that there exists a declining portal-to-central gradient in liver fatty acid binding protein cellular abundance in the hepatic acinus of untreated male rats. Furthermore, the increased synthesis and abundance of liver fatty acid binding protein in female and clofibrate-treated male rats results in two different alterations in the acinar expression of this protein, i.e. a pericentral increase (female) or a panlobular increase (clofibrate). Elucidation of the relationship between the zonation of hepatic fatty acid metabolism and the acinar expression of liver fatty acid binding protein should provide a more detailed understanding of the function of this protein.\r"

However, the frequency with which this anomaly is found in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and hence its numerical importance as an etiological association of the tumor, has not been ascertained. Using radionuclide and contrast venography as well as necropsy and laparotomy examination, we investigated 162 unselected southern African Blacks with hepatocellular carcinoma together with appropriate controls for the presence of membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava. Membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava was detected in six of 162 (3.7%) hepatocellular carcinoma patients, compared with one of 279 subjects (0.36% p = 0.011) dying a violent death, none of 55 patients (p = 0.169) with malignant disease other than hepatocellular carcinoma and eight of 150 patients (5.3%; p = 0.336) being investigated for conditions which might have been associated with membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava. Six of the 15 individuals (40%) found to have membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava had concomitant hepatocellular carcinoma, confirming that membranous obstruction of the inferior vena cava constitutes a risk factor for the development of the tumor. However, only a very small proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma patients have this abnormality, so that it is a minor causal association of the tumor only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89065599\r", 
  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is a 6,000 Da polypeptide hormone produced by glands of the gastrointestinal tract, namely the salivary and Brunner's glands. It is found in a wide variety of external secretions as well as in blood and amniotic fluid. In fetal and neonatal life, EGF appears to play an important role in the development of the oral cavity, lungs, gastrointestinal tract and eyelids. Its presence in cells of the central nervous system suggests that it also plays a role in modulating the development of this system. In adult animals, the function of EGF is much less well understood. In rodents, it apparently modulates acid secretion from parietal cells in the stomach, and it undoubtedly plays an important role in wound healing, either through its localization within skin or by the licking of wounds with EGF-containing saliva. Considerable evidence now suggests that it may be one of the key factors in initiating liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy or chemical injury. The liver appears to be the principal organ which regulates the circulating level of EGF. In fact, EGF is cleared so efficiently by the liver that only the peripheral cells of the lobule (zone 1) sequester EGF, and little remains in the circulation for cells in the more distal zones (zones 2 and 3). In the liver, EGF normally binds to a plasma membrane receptor and is internalized within the liver cell, where the vast majority of EGF and its receptor are destroyed in lysosomes. A small but consistent quantity of EGF enters the bile intact. In the regenerating liver, however, the lysosomal pathway appears to be shut down, and the EGF is diverted to hepatocyte nuclei prior to the initiation of DNA synthesis. Nuclear EGF is found free as well as bound to a high-molecular-weight protein which has many characteristics identical to the plasma membrane EGF receptor. The plasma membrane receptor is a large transmembrane glycoprotein of 170,000 Da containing four domains: an extracellular EGF-binding portion, a hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment, a proximal cytoplasmic domain which binds ATP and protein substrates containing tyrosine for phosphorylation and a terminal cytoplasmic portion with 3 tyrosines which undergo autophosphorylation after EGF binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

They provide a new dimension in the assessment of pathophysiology and morphology of the hepatobiliary system. The amount of uptake and the rapidity of its elimination from the liver is dependent upon the structural configuration of the agent as well as the functional integrity of the hepatocyte and the patency of the biliary system. The clinical areas for application are wide and include most of the hepatobiliary diseases. Technetium-99m-iminodiacetic acid, an agent well suited for both planar and single photon tomographic scintigraphy, is ideal for early diagnosis prior to anatomical changes in the hepatobiliary system. The data collection directly from the liver provides quantitation of both regional and global liver diseases. The count-based method for measuring gallbladder emptying overcomes the theoretical disadvantages of geometric tests. Biokinetics and current clinical application of six of the 99mTc-iminodiacetic acid agents are reviewed, and the potential future clinical and research areas of application are indicated.\r"

To probe the mechanisms underlying hepatocellular dysfunction in liver cirrhosis, we have investigated receptor-ligand interactions for asialoorosomucoid, insulin and epidermal growth factor in hepatocytes isolated from the livers of rats chronically exposed to phenobarbital and carbon tetrachloride for up to 12 weeks. Viable cells were allowed to attach at 37 degrees C and the high-affinity cell surface binding sites for each ligand were assessed at 4 degrees C in the presence of [125I]-ligand. In parallel incubations, digitonin (0.055%) was added to the binding medium to assess total cellular binding sites. Results demonstrated that chronic treatment of rats with phenobarbital increased hepatocyte asialoorosomucoid surface receptor affinity (p less than 0.05) but had no affect on the number of asialoglycoprotein binding sites. Treatment with CCl4 and phenobarbital significantly reduced the number of surface binding sites for asialoorosomucoid (p less than 0.05) and epidermal growth factor (p less than 0.02), although this treatment had no effect on either the binding affinity or the number of binding sites for insulin. The decrease in cell surface binding sites for asialoorosomucoid and epidermal growth factor was not due to a redistribution of the surface sites to intracellular locations, since the total number of cellular binding sites also was reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

A cosmid vector containing multiple copies of the hepatitis B virus genome was transfected into FL5-1 cells; it reduced their sensitivity to interferons as measured by inhibition of the cytopathic effect of Sindbis virus challenge. Similar vectors transfected into HeLa cells reduced their sensitivity to interferon as measured by production of beta 2-microglobulin. This resistance to interferon in hepatitis B virus-transfected cells may be a trans-acting phenomenon related to nucleotide homology between hepatitis B virus DNA and sequences regulating the interferon-induced antiviral system. Alternatively, other mechanisms involving transcription or translation products of hepatitis B virus may be responsible. Hepatitis B virus-induced cellular resistance to the action of interferon may be important in maintaining the chronic carrier state.\r"

  ".W": "We have further investigated the cytotoxicity of methyl mercury (MeHg) in cerebellar granule neurons isolated from 5-12-day-old rats. At 20 microM MeHg adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were reduced to 30% of control within 15 minutes and 1% of control at three hours (h), while cell viability assayed by trypan blue exclusion was reduced to approximately 80% and 20% of control, respectively. When potassium cyanide (KCN) was used to reduce ATP levels greater than 95%, virtually no change in cell viability was observed during three h incubation. Potassium cyanide combined with cycloheximide and actinomycin D to inhibit ATP and macromolecule synthesis simultaneously caused substantially less cell death than that produced by MeHg. Comparable rates of cell death were obtained when the free-radical generating system, hypoxanthine plus xanthine oxidase, was included with KCN in the incubation. Murine hybridoma MHY206 cells, representing a non-neuronal cell type, were less sensitive to cell killing by MeHg compared to granule neurons at equivalent cell protein concentrations. A three h exposure to 20 microM MeHg resulted in the death of 96% of the granule neurons while only 27% of the hybridoma cells were permeable to trypan blue. The results suggest that additional cytotoxic mechanisms beyond perturbations of the main metabolic pathways are involved in the neurotoxic mechanism of action of MeHg in cerebellar granule neurons. The results also indicate that oxidative or free-radical-generating systems are capable of reproducing the temporal pattern of neuronal cell destruction manifested by MeHg.\r"

  ".W": "An extensive panel of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) and monospecific antisera reactive against neuroectodermal-, neuronal-, glial-, and lymphoid-associated antigens, extracellular matrix, HLA, and cell-surface receptors was used to characterize the phenotype of four continuous, karyotypically distinct medulloblastoma cell lines and transplantable xenografts. All four cell lines demonstrated significant reactivity with anti-neuroectodermal-associated MAb. No apparent pattern of reactivity with anti-lymphoid MAb was seen; notably, there was a uniform absence of detectable Thy-1. Review of the complete antibody reactivity profile revealed a dichotomy between lines TE-671 and Daoy and lines D283 Med and D341 Med, which have been previously shown to express neurofilament protein in culture and xenografts, and to exhibit neuroblastic morphological features in biopsy and xenograft tissue sections. TE-671 and Daoy reacted with the MAb directed against tenascin, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, HLA-A,B epitopes, beta 2-microglobulin and 5/8 of the glioma-associated antigens, but did not react with the anti-neurofilament protein (NFP) MAb. D283 Med and D341 Med expressed NFP but did not react with MAb against tenascin, EGF receptor, HLA-A,B epitopes, beta 2-microglobulin or 6/8 and 7/8 (respectively) of the glioma-associated antigens. The observed phenotypic differences provide a conceptual framework for investigating basic differences in the biological behavior of medulloblastoma. Moreover, the subdivisions can be evaluated for prospective value in tissue diagnosis, cerebrospinal fluid cytology and antibody-mediated imaging and therapy.\r"

Follow-up extended to 9 years; a minimum of 3 years was obtained for greater than 90% of the patients. All patients with osteosarcoma were considered, but only those with tissue confirmation who had had at least part of their first course of treatment at one of the 13 institutions were included. There were 543 patients. In a search for prognostic indicators, 38 patient characteristics, three treatment categories, and an institutional variable were studied. A combination of nine of these constituted the best indicator of survival. They were morphology (two parts), site of primary cancer (two parts), spread of tumor, grade and size of tumor, duration of symptoms, weight loss of greater than 4.5 kg (10 lb), swelling at primary site, and lytic appearance. Unexpectedly, treatment was not one of the indicators of survival. A prognostic score was developed in which the coefficients were obtained from the Cox regression (step-down) method. Each patient had a score (S) and an observed survival time that together provided the expected risk of death for that patient. Although this was not a randomized study, treatments were compared before and after adjusting for characteristics identified as prognostic. Three treatments differed little: surgery alone, surgery plus chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy followed in 1-4 months by surgery. Patients with amputations and those with resections had similar death rates, but the observed progression rates differed widely. However, when the rates were adjusted for prognostic characteristics, the difference disappeared. Complete surgery (if osteosarcoma existed within surgical margins) was no better than incomplete surgery (if osteosarcoma existed beyond surgical margins) with respect to death but, as would be expected, complete surgery was much better with respect to disease progression.\r"

We used three Chinese hamster ovary cell lines (AuxB1, CHRC5, and UV20), two murine tumor cell lines (KHT-LP1 and EMT6/Ro), and two human tumor cell lines (MGH-U1 and DLD-1). Intracellular DOX was measured by its fluorescence intensity with flow cytometry, and drug cytotoxicity was quantified with clonogenic assays. When data for all of the cell lines were combined, cell killing was correlated with the intracellular concentration of DOX (r = -.88). For the cell line AuxB1 and its DOX-resistant subline CHRC5, in which cells express high levels of P-glycoprotein, the relationship between cell survival and the intracellular concentration of DOX was stronger than that for the other cell lines. These results suggest that differences in intracellular accumulation of DOX account for much of the heterogeneity in response to the drug in cells from different cell lines, although additional mechanisms also contribute to variation in drug sensitivity. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular DOX fluorescence is a simple assay that should be tested in cells from human tumors as a possible predictor of tumor response. For a given cell line, this technique also provides a rapid way to monitor the development of drug resistance after multiple courses of chemotherapy.\r"

However, needle biopsy of the tumor revealed embryonal cell carcinoma. Serum alpha-fetoprotein was 10,700 ng. per ml. Preoperatively, combined cytotoxic chemotherapy was administered and the antineoplastic effect was excellent. Serum alpha-fetoprotein rapidly returned to the normal range and the tumor volume decreased. Although the preoperative diagnosis was extragonadal germ cell tumor of the prostate, surgery revealed that the tumor originated from the retrovesical region. Orchiectomy and resection were performed. The resected tissue was mostly necrotic with a few viable cells of embryonal cell carcinoma, no metastatic lesions were detected in the lymph nodes and no masses were noted in the testes. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy. His condition has remained good with no clinical evidence of recurrence of the disease.\r"

Clinical data were compared between 14 patients with undetermined tension (control group) and 57 with tension of either 400, 600, 700, 800 or 1,000 gm. Experimental study during the operation demonstrated that changes in the posterior urethrovesical angle and distance that the bladder neck was elevated were not proportional to the tension: the lower the thread tension the larger the change in these 2 parameters. Compared to the control group a significant decrease in the period of suprapubic drainage was observed in patients with quantified tension. Operative success was obtained in 86 per cent of the control group and 91 per cent of those in whom tension was quantified. A tension of 400 to 600 gm. seemed to be most appropriate for a successful outcome. We conclude that quantifying the thread tension is useful to prevent either over-tightness of the nylon loops or insufficient suspension of the bladder neck, and that with a spring scale it is easy to instruct a beginner on how tightly to tie the threads.\r"

A rectangular island of in situ anterior vaginal wall underlying the urethra and bladder neck is developed, the 4 corners are anchored with polypropylene sutures and a ligature carrier is used to transfer the sutures to a suprapubic location. An anterior vaginal wall flap proximal to the island is advanced to cover the island. When the sutures are tied the resulting sling will support the urethra and increase urethral resistance by compression, restoring continence. The advantages are its simplicity, need for only a small incision, short operative time and hospital stay, and reliance on healthy, well vascularized, in situ tissue. Continence has been achieved in 29 of 32 cases. All patients voided spontaneously except for those with neuropathic urethral incompetence who required self-catheterization.\r"

The frequency of urethral strictures was significantly lower after Otis internal urethrotomy (4 per cent) than after a 2-day urethral catheter dilation (16 per cent). The incidence of stricture formation was similar in patients operated on with a polytetrafluoroethylene coated (8 per cent) and with an uninsulated metal (12 per cent) resectoscope sheath. The incidence of stricture formation was unrelated to age, duration of preoperative and postoperative catheterization, operating time and presence of urinary tract infection.\r"

Herrick's intern, Ernest E. Irons, abreast of the latest developments in medicine, actually performed the blood work and alerted Herrick about the odd-looking cells. Changing patterns in American race relations allowed the patient, Walter Clement Noel, to study dentistry in Chicago. He continued to receive care from Irons for 2 1/2 years, then returned to Grenada to practice dentistry. Noel died nine years after his return to Grenada, at age 32.\r"

To investigate the direct consequences of this, 11 fetal lambs were given ritodrine hydrochloride for periods of 2-4 days by continuous intravenous infusion at 5 or 10 micrograms/minute (1-3 micrograms/minute/kg estimated fetal weight). These dosages had no measurable effects on the ewes. In the fetus, measurements confirmed and extended the results of earlier short-term experiments, but differences from the effects of long-term maternal ritodrine infusion imply little placental transfer of the drug in sheep. Ritodrine had little or no effect on mean arterial pressure, blood pH, pCO2, plasma alpha-amino acid nitrogen, or growth hormone, but resulted in marked hypoxemia, tachycardia, hyperlactacidemia, hyperglycemia, and hyperinsulinemia during the first 24-48 hours of infusion. Despite continued ritodrine infusion, heart rate and the metabolic parameters returned toward normal within 72 hours. Hypoxemia persisted longer, but tended to lessen after 2 days of infusion. The results indicate that tachyphylaxis to ritodrine develops in the fetal lamb during prolonged administration, but that when fetal well-being is already compromised, ritodrine's effects on oxygenation and lactacidemia could jeopardize fetal survival.\r"

When tested for interleukin-1-like activity with the D10.G4.1 T-cell bioassay, supernatants from endotoxin-stimulated decidua contained significantly more interleukin-1 activity than did supernatants from unstimulated decidua. This activity could not be attributed to interleukin-2, as determined in the CTLL/2 assay for interleukin-2. Interleukin-1-like activity was due to interleukin-1, as demonstrated by the blockade of this bioactivity with antibodies against interleukin-1: interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta. Antibodies against interleukin-1 alpha blocked the activity in five of six cases. In one instance, the bioactivity could be attributed to a mixture of interleukin-1 alpha and interleukin-1 beta.

Pregnancy was associated with a decrease in serum prostacyclin binding and a shorter prostacyclin half-life. This decrease was even greater in women with hypertensive disorders. The decrease in prostacyclin half-life in hypertensive disorders may play an important role in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Measurement of both production and metabolism, however, will be required to adequately assess the role of prostacyclin in normal and abnormal gestation.\r"

Five of seven cases contained estrogen receptors, three low-grade (fewer than 10 mitoses/10 high-power fields [hpf]) and two high-grade (10 or more mitoses/10 hpf), the latter having a relatively low mitotic rate. The two negative cases were high-grade with a very high number of mitoses. Tumor cells were positive only to vimentin. Based on these results, we postulate that estrogen receptors are undetectable only in highly proliferating neoplasms. Thus, immunohistochemically determined estrogen receptor levels may indicate the aggressiveness of endometrial stromal sarcoma, and might be a guideline in selecting patients for hormonal therapy. The presence of positive immunostaining to vimentin confirms the mesenchymal origin of endometrial stromal sarcoma.\r"

In the past, the presence of any cystic adnexal enlargement in postmenopausal women was an indication for surgical exploration. The ultrasound scans of 42 postmenopausal women with simple adnexal cysts were reviewed. We included only patients who were available for follow-up and who had cysts that were less than or equal to 5 cm in maximum diameter, unilocular (ie, without septations or solid components), and without ascites. Of these patients, 26 underwent prompt surgical exploration. All exhibited benign histopathology. In 16 patients, serial sonographic surveillance was performed every 3-6 months. Two of these patients had exploratory laparotomy at 6 and 9 months of observation; the first operation, for increasing size and septation, demonstrated a cystadenofibroma, and the second, for increasing pain, demonstrated a degenerating myoma. The remaining 14 patients were followed from 10-73 months without any change in size or character of the cyst. Small (less than 5 cm), unilocular postmenopausal cysts had a low incidence of malignant disease (0%) in this series of 28 surgical specimens. Therefore, serial ultrasound follow-up without surgical intervention may play a role in the clinical management of such patients.\r"

Of the patients enrolled in the study, 131 received oral acyclovir capsules (800 mg) daily and 130 received placebo capsules. Medication was taken twice daily. Analysis of data from patients who completed a full year of therapy demonstrated that only 5% of patients receiving placebo were free from recurrences, as compared with 46% of acyclovir recipients. The mean number of recurrences for patients on acyclovir therapy was 1.8, as compared with a rate of 8.7 recurrences for the placebo group over the course of the year. The mean time to the first recurrent herpes outbreaks was 19 days for the placebo group and 274 days for the acyclovir-treated patients. There were no significant differences between the two groups in laboratory data or in the frequency or nature of side effects reported. Daily administration of acyclovir capsules for 1 year is a safe and effective therapy for control of frequent recurrences of genital herpes.\r"

  ".W": "Dating of maturity of the endometrium by histologic examination was correlated with four methods of ovulation detection in 13 cycling parous women. Histologic dating was assessed independently by two pathologists and correlated with the postovulatory duration as determined by daily transvaginal ultrasound scanning, serum LH measurements, basal body temperature (BBT), and subtraction of 14 days from the onset of menses. In addition, progesterone and estradiol (E2) were measured in daily serum samples. Dating of the endometrial biopsy was highly correlated (P less than .002) with the day of ovulation as determined by ultrasound, and was found to be within 2 days of the correct postovulatory day on evaluation of 25 of 26 (96.1%) of the interpretations. The accuracy of dating using the LH surge was 84.6% (22 of 26 interpretations), and with the BBT thermogenic shift was 76.9% (20 of 26 interpretations). However, dating of the endometrium was within 2 days of the correct day in only 17 of the 26 interpretations as determined by subtracting 14 days from the onset of the subsequent menses. The accuracy of dating was significantly better correlated (P less than .025) with days from ovulation as determined by ultrasound than as calculated from the onset of menses. There was a significant correlation between endometrial dating and the amount of progesterone (P less than .01) and E2 (P less than .01) secreted from the day of ovulation, as determined by transvaginal ultrasound, to the day of biopsy. These data confirm a strong correlation between endometrial dating and ovarian hormone secretion during the postovulatory phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Lymphedema, transient drainage, poor ankle motion, limb shortening, nonunion, and delayed union were all significant problems. On average, the patients endured over six operations, 2 months of hospitalization, and a year's course of physical rehabilitation. The study indicates that, although popular, such a regimen is not without important shortcomings. This experience has influenced our selection of and counseling for patients in whom we are contemplating such management.\r"

  ".W": "In this critical review of human in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the questions of which chemical species can be detected and with what sensitivity, their biochemical significance, and their potential clinical value are addressed. The current in vivo detectability limit is about 10(-6) of that of tissue water protons, necessitating a 1-10 cm3-volume of tissue and approximately 10-minute averaging time. This permits access to fats, membrane lipid metabolism, high-energy phosphate metabolism, glycogen, some neurotransmitters and metabolites in the citric acid cycle, and artificially introduced fluorocompounds. While hydrogen-31, phosphorus-31, carbon-13, sodium-23, and fluorine-19 in vivo results are discussed, the majority of patient studies use P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Here results from metabolic and ischemic disorders substantiate a case for spectroscopy as a diagnostic modality. The use of a broad range of spatial localization strategies is justifiable on the basis of the location and size of the pathologic condition and of NMR sensitivity. Abnormalities in spectra from many other disorders, most notably cancer, and improvements are often observed early in the course of successful therapy. Yet the potential impact of these results on clinical diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring is not always well understood, and many questions remain. Neurotransmitters and citric acid cycle metabolites exhibit high H-1 NMR sensitivities and represent major untapped potential for human clinical spectroscopy research. Studies evaluating spectroscopy in the context of existing modalities are needed. The unique ability of spectroscopy to provide noninvasive information about tissue chemistry in patients bodes well for its impact on clinical research and disease diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging offers a noninvasive method of evaluating the mediastinum in infants with suspected compression of the trachea by the innominate artery. MR imaging was performed in 17 infants and children, aged 3-29 months, who had obstructive airway symptoms and who had undergone flexible fiberoptic tracheobronchoscopy. MR and endoscopic findings correlated in all cases but one. Of the remaining 16 patients, eight had endoscopic and MR evidence of tracheal compression at the level of the innominate artery, and eight had a normal upper thoracic trachea. In both groups, the innominate artery was situated anterior and to the left of the trachea with no difference in anatomic relationships. Measurements of the anteroposterior and transverse dimensions of the upper part of the mediastinum and the thymus failed to disclose significant differences between the two groups. Follow-up examinations of three patients showed decreasing tracheal compression without changes in tracheal-arterial relationships. This investigation disclosed no evidence of excessive mediastinal crowding. The findings support previous angiographic observations indicating that anterior tracheal compression is not due to an anomalous position of the innominate artery. Symptoms of tracheal compression may result from an intrinsic deficiency of the tracheal cartilage rather than an anatomic abnormality of the mediastinum or its vasculature.\r"

However, the eventual clinical outcome was good or excellent in 85% of all cases. Various factors appeared to be responsible for the development of complications or the eventual clinical outcome, including union of the graft with the host tissue, soft-tissue swelling, callus formation, and type of allograft (hemi or full). Knowledge of these factors and the relationship between complications and radiographic findings may lead to an early diagnosis and appropriate treatment.\r"

These nodules have been demonstrated more frequently because of the increased use of ultrasonography (US) in the screening of high-risk patients. Treatment is a problem because surgical resection of a precancerous lesion is considered by some to be unadvisable in patients with high surgical risk. The authors used percutaneous ethanol injection with US guidance in five patients with AHNs that measured 1.4-2.6 cm. A total of 30 injections were performed, without complications. Lesions were undetectable or were reduced in size on follow-up US scans. All biopsies yielded necrotic material. No recurrences have been demonstrated with US after 9-21 months. Percutaneous ethanol injection is therefore proposed as a therapeutic alternative for small AHNs.\r"

The postoperative graft usually appears enlarged and inhomogeneous, with patchy areas of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images that may last 3-4 weeks. During acute rejection, T1-weighted images of graft abnormalities show a decrease in signal intensity, similar to that of muscle, and T2-weighted images show an increase in signal intensity, equal to or higher than that of the bladder. The pattern of abnormal signal is most frequently multifocal but can be diffuse, and the graft may be enlarged. During recovery from rejection, the graft parenchyma shows a decrease in signal intensity (less than that of the bladder) on T2-weighted images when compared with that of acute rejection. During chronic rejection the graft is small and shows low signal intensity, slightly higher than or similar to that of muscle, on both T1- and T2-weighted images. MR imaging appears to be useful for detection of early pancreas allograft rejection and complications in conjunction with clinical findings, laboratory data, and other radiologic procedures.\r"

The positive predictive value for transrectal US fell to 24% if results of the DRE were normal, 12% if the PSA level was normal, and 5% if both DRE results and PSA level were normal. No cancers were detected in lesions 1.0 cm or smaller if DRE results and PSA level were normal. DRE and PSA study are valuable complements to abnormal transrectal US examinations.

Fragments as small as 0.8 mm in diameter could be detected at 7.5 MHz, although a practical limitation of 1-2 mm for lower transducer frequencies (3.5 and 5.0 MHz) was observed. Fragment diameter tended to be overestimated with US by a mean of 1 mm. Transducers of 5 and 7.5 MHz were more accurate in determination of size than 3.5-MHz transducers. Struvite fragments were less echogenic and were therefore measured more accurately, but smaller struvite fragments were less detectable than other fragment types. Fragment \"clumping\" led to significant overestimation of residual stone size even when small fragments were separated by as much as the distance equal to the diameter of one fragment. This study demonstrates that even under the best circumstances the disadvantages of US in assessing residual stone disease are significant.\r"

Three of the 37 patients were excluded from further consideration due to lack of follow-up. Obstruction was confirmed in two of the remaining 34 patients (6%).

Correlation with angiographic findings suggests that the high-frequency Doppler signals were associated with arteriovenous shunts.

The cases all involved diamniotic twins and covered a broad range of severity. Discordant fetal size and differing amniotic fluid volume in the two sacs were the most common findings. In more severe cases, hydrops of the recipient fetus and/or a \"stuck\" donor fetus was seen. Intrauterine death of one or both twins was observed in four cases.

  ".W": "The imaging studies obtained after single-lung transplantation in 14 patients were reviewed. The reimplantation response occurred in 13 patients and was an early, transient process, which varied in its manifestations from a subtle perihilar haze to dense consolidation with air bronchograms. Nine episodes of acute rejection, an imprecise clinical diagnosis, occurred in eight of the patients. The associated chest radiographic changes were variable and included basal or diffuse reticular interstitial disease in three cases and basal and/or perihilar consolidation in three cases; no change was detected in three cases. On four occasions, the radiographic changes resolved within 24 hours of intravenous corticosteroid administration. The radiographic findings associated with the reimplantation response and rejection were nonspecific and could have been mistaken for those of fluid overload, atelectasis, mucous plugging, and pneumonia. Bronchial dehiscence was well demonstrated by the finding at computed tomography of extraluminal air adjacent to the bronchial anastomosis. One patient developed multiple pulmonary nodules due to cyclosporine-induced lymphoma.\r"

  ".U": "89073011\r", 
  ".W": "The most common cause of occlusion of the splenic vein is pancreatic disease, such as pancreatitis or carcinoma of the pancreas. As compared with benign causes, carcinoma of the pancreatic body or tail may readily involve not only the splenic vein, but also, eventually, the splenic artery. Therefore, the clinical features of occlusion of the splenic vein may be profoundly altered according to the nature of the underlying causes. In an attempt to clarify the pathophysiologic findings and hemodynamic mechanism of occlusion of the splenic vein associated with carcinoma of the pancreas, three patient reports were selected from our past experience. Upon analyzing the clinical course of these patients, three consecutive phases may be distinguished. Phase 1 is the insidious or latent phase represented by Patient No. 1. The splenic vein is partially occluded and gastric varices or splenomegaly has not developed. Phase 2, the collateral developing phase, is represented by Patient No. 2. The splenic vein is completely occluded while the splenic artery is patent, resulting in marked gastric varices and splenomegaly. Phase 3 is the vanishing phase and is represented by Patient No. 3. The occlusion of the splenic artery is superimposed on the occlusion of the splenic vein, causing gastric varices to vanish and the enlarged spleen to shrink.\r"

  ".W": "A strain gauge device called the electronic contractility meter (ECM) was designed to measure quantitatively intestinal ischemic damage by delivering electrical stimuli to the intestine. Threshold stimulus level (TSL) was the minimum stimulus in milliamps necessary to produce a smooth muscle contractile response. TSL scale ranged from zero to 100 milliamps. Resection and anastomosis in ischemic intestinal segments was carried out in 30 dogs to compare TSL, intestinal color, peristalsis, Doppler ultrasound and resection margin histology with survival. There were five fatal anastomotic leaks, all resulting from intestinal necrosis. Doppler pulse in the marginal artery (MA) was absent at four of the five anastomoses that leaked versus eight of the 25 that healed (p less than or equal to 0.01). Mean TSL at the resection site was 38 +/- 7 milliamps in surviving dogs versus 51 +/- 4 milliamps in nonsurvivors (p less than or equal to 0.001). Mean TSL of normal intestine was 22 +/- 2 milliamps. Both TSL and Doppler ultrasound also correlated with resection margin histology (p less than or equal to 0.02 and p less than or equal to 0.005, respectively). Presence of peristalsis did not correlate with histologic grade or survival rate. Intestinal color correlated with resection margin histology (p less than or equal to 0.001) but not survival. The ECM and Doppler ultrasound were both superior to gross visual assessment in predicting intestinal survival. The ECM quantitatively measures tissue damage, a potential advantage over Doppler ultrasound, which provides only an estimate of local arterial blood flow.\r"

For unknown reasons, the book was never published in North America, leaving the surgeons of North America ignorant of Bassini's intentions.

The description given by Andrews of his personal observation of Bassini operating should have, but did not, enlighten North American surgeons.

We report our findings in nine children with grade 2 and grade 3 blunt renal injuries who were evaluated with CT. One patient had a nephrectomy; the other eight were managed nonsurgically. Six patients had follow-up CT scans 5-19 months later to assess healing. Scars were evident in each case, and the extent of deformity paralleled the magnitude of the initial injury. One patient with a grade 2 injury and two patients with grade 3 injuries healed with small focal scars; three patients with grade 3 injuries healed with large polar scars. In five patients, the CT findings were compared with the findings on 99mTc-DTPA renal imaging. The injured kidneys contributed 30-45% (mean, 38%) of total renal function. In six patients with renal trauma who were treated conservatively, the involved kidneys healed and significant kidney function was preserved, although early surgical intervention might have been beneficial for one of these patients. Prospective studies are needed to evaluate further the effectiveness of this conservative approach.\r"

On plain films, the Teflon rarely may be seen as faintly radiodense. On sonography, it is echogenic and has variable acoustic shadowing. On CT it is dense (160-466 H). Postsurgical cystography showed cessation of reflux in 83 ureters (72%). Complications of STING were uncommon. No granulomatous masses were identified in the region adjacent to the STING. Transient, free peritoneal fluid developed in three children and ureteral dilatation in six, three of whom required intervention. In one child, most of the Teflon disappeared from the original site of injection, as noted on a follow-up CT scan; possibly it had been extruded into the bladder. The STING procedure probably will become more popular. Knowledge of its radiologic appearance is important for the radiologist in order to effectively evaluate these children postoperatively.\r"

Of the 174 patients without acute appendicitis, 93 patients (53%) were ultimately discharged with a diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin. Of the 81 patients in whom specific diagnoses were established, sonography suggested the correct diagnosis in 57 patients (70%). A broad spectrum of diseases was detected, including: gynecologic diseases (35); visceral diseases, including hollow viscera and diseases of liver, pancreas, or spleen (18); and urinary tract abnormalities (four). This study suggests that sonography is useful in establishing alternative diagnoses in patients undergoing sonography for suspected acute appendicitis.\r"

To determine if transvaginal sonography could allow a more frequent and confident prediction of imminent ovulation, we prospectively monitored 22 ovulatory menstrual cycles in four women undergoing artificial insemination and in 13 normally menstruating volunteers. Scanning was done on alternate days in the periovulatory period; a 7.5-MHz transvaginal transducer was used. Despite the improved resolution obtained with transvaginal sonography, confident identification of the cumulus oophorus or of mural changes in the follicle was not possible in any of the cycles followed. No other consistent follicular characteristic predicted imminent ovulation. We conclude that confident prediction of imminent ovulation is not possible with sonographic analysis.\r"

Six patients had previous coronary artery bypass operations, 1 had undergone repair of an abdominal aneurysm and 1 had pulmonary embolism. Sixteen patients were in New York Heart Association class IV and 9 in class III. Donor mean age was 30 (14 to 46) years. Hospital stay after transplantation was 10 to 90 days (median 11). Four died within 30 days and none from 5 to 59 months (mean 22). The 1-year actuarial survival was 84%. The incidence of rejection was 2.16 episodes per patient. Only 1 patient (4%) had serious infection. Six patients received antihypertensive treatment, 3 had reversible impairment of renal function, 2 had gout and 1 had drop foot. No patient had convulsions, transient ischemic attack or cerebrovascular accident. None had significant psychological problems. The 21 patients currently alive are in New York Heart Association class I. Quality of life, assessed by the Nottingham Health Profile, showed marked improvement. It is concluded that the initial results of cardiac transplantation in the seventh decade of life are encouraging.\r"

Nevertheless, the introduction of an innovation is usually accompanied by resistance and hostility. This article traces the development of the concept and practice of antisepsis in health care, with emphasis on the contributions of three individuals who were contemporaries practicing in different health care fields, but who apparently were uninfluenced by each others' work. Semmelweis, a Hungarian obstetrician, recognized the importance of person-to-person transmission of infectious agents and effected dramatic reductions in puerperal mortality by requiring antiseptic handwashing. Lister, a Scottish surgeon, was the first physician to apply the germ theory to clinical practice and developed the techniques of antiseptic surgery and wound care, resulting in dramatic reductions in surgical mortality. Nightingale, a British nurse, initiated sanitary reforms in hospitals, schools, and military camps in England and abroad, incorporating high levels of environmental and personal hygiene. These reforms were also succeeded by dramatic reductions in mortality. In light of historical and current evidence of efficacy and the evidence of continued inadequacies in practice, it seems reasonable to speculate that further reductions in nosocomial infection rates are possible by a more careful application among individual practitioners of the basic principles of antisepsis.\r"

DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant literature in English from 1957 through early 1988 was identified via textbooks, original research articles, and review and policy papers, supplemented by a computer-based search of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected because of prominence, based on frequent citation or policy authoritativeness, and relevance to the epidemiologic and clinical constructs of this paper. RESULTS: We analyze the epidemiologic studies underlying the higher diagnostic glycemic thresholds for diabetes proposed by the National Diabetes Data Group and we suggest a diagnostic strategy in which glycated hemoglobin may substitute for glucose tolerance testing. Our section on treatment stresses matching the intensiveness of hypoglycemic therapy with the intensiveness of monitoring: emphasizing the role of self blood glucose monitoring. Our findings and recommendations are summarized in the figures and tables. CONCLUSIONS: Major advances in the diagnosis and management of diabetes have been made in the past 10 years. In particular, an array of epidemiologic studies have provided a logical basis for diagnostic standards, and two new means of assessing glycemia--glycated hemoglobin and self-monitoring of blood glucose--have become widely available. These tests allow more convenient approaches to diagnosis, and provide a fuller description of glycemia, permitting more informed and intensive therapy.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To review the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections in men, especially insofar as they differ from those in women. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Studies published between 1954 and 1988 were identified using MEDLINE (1981-1988) and Index Medicus (1981-1988), and through extensive manual searching of textbooks, symposia, monographs, and bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: More than 200 studies were reviewed; those studies most pertinent to the topics reviewed were cited. Unpublished data from the author's studies were also cited. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality and descriptive information about prevalence, evaluations, interventions, and outcomes were assessed. Quantitative synthesis was not done. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: Most men with urinary tract infection have a functional or anatomic abnormality of the genitourinary tract. Prostatic hypertrophy and genitourinary instrumentation are the major predispositions to infection in men. Signs and symptoms of bacteriuria in men are similar to those in women. Diagnosis rests on a properly collected specimen yielding 10(3) or more colony-forming units/mL of a single or predominant species. Eschericia coli is the most frequent uropathogen, but other gram-negative and gram-positive species cause up to one half of cases. Treatment of men with single-dose therapy is inadequate; men with recurrent infections require at least 6 weeks of appropriate treatment. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in elderly men, but does not usually necessitate treatment. Although genitourinary abnormalities are frequent in bacteriuric male patients, a diagnostic evaluation is probably indicated only in young boys and in men with recurrent or complicated infections. CONCLUSIONS: Several important aspects of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of urinary tract infections differ in male populations from those in the much better studied female populations. Knowledge of recently available data will help clinicians develop a rational approach to caring for bacteriuric men.\r"

All samples contained proteolytic activity, tentatively identified as plasmin on the basis of comigration with purified human plasmin in zymographic analysis. In 19 specimens the plasmin level exceeded 1 microgram/mg of protein; the highest value recorded was 18.7 micrograms/mg. Low levels of net plasminogen activator activity were found in 12 specimens and identified as urokinase according to comigration with the urokinase standard in zymography. Fibronectin was detected in all but one of the 42 specimens; in seven specimens the levels exceeded those in normal plasma, calculated per milligram of total protein. Extensive fragmentation of fibronectin was found in 19 specimens, correlating with high plasmin levels. The results are indicative of an ongoing proteolytic process in secretory otitis media and suggest that plasmin-caused degradation of the fibronectin-containing basement membrane and subsequent formation of granulation tissue may be involved in the development of adhesive middle ears.\r"

It has not, however, been defined as a distinct clinical entity in children. We studied 12 children, ages 3 to 9 years, with downward-fluctuating progressive high-frequency neurosensory hearing losses whose symptoms were thought to be related to the isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct identified by high-resolution computed tomographic scanning. Previously it had been assumed that a large vestibular aqueduct is a temporal bone dysplasia that is a variant of the Mondini type of deformity and that the associated hearing loss is congenital in nature. Our clinical observations, however, indicate that the hearing loss in children with an isolated enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct is acquired during childhood. The natural history of this progressive deafness is reviewed, and a pathophysiologic hypothesis is presented.\r"

Conventional surgical techniques for the repair of such fistulas involving bony defects have essentially been abandoned by the author. Current protocol calls for their repair in early adolescence (before the age of 10 years) following completion of any required orthodontic expansion of the maxillary dental arch. At the time of fistula repair, all scar tissue is excised between the maxillary segments. Both palatal and gingival soft-tissue flaps are developed to cover either free cancellous bone grafts or free periosteal grafts used to bridge the maxillary defect. This change in technique has resulted in osteogenic filling of the maxillary bony defect and has markedly improved the success rate of fistula repair. Furthermore, it has enhanced the aesthetic correction of the nasal alar base cleft stigmas.\r"

Two of four patients with extensive disease died of their tumors, one, with extensive involvement of the base of the skull, became unavailable for follow-up, and, one year after diagnosis, one is alive with middle cranial fossa disease. A review of the medical literature provides further evidence of the locally aggressive behavior and potentially lethal nature of this tumor. No effective treatment has evolved for extensive ameloblastomas of the maxilla that have invaded surrounding vital structures. When tumor-free surgical margins are not possible, radiation therapy may offer palliation of disease.\r"

The infection was caused by Staphylococcus aureus in seven, Haemophilus influenzae in three, Branhamella catarrhalis in one and Streptococcus pneumoniae in one. Both H. influenzae and B. catarrhalis were isolated in another patient, and no organism was found in the remaining patient. In addition to the bacteria, viruses were cultured from the tracheal secretions of two patients. The mean duration of intubation was 7.6 days and of hospital stay 9.2 days. Twelve of the cases occurred during the cold months of the year (October to March). Of the three deaths only one occurred in the pediatric intensive care unit and was due to severe bronchospasm and an air leak that caused bilateral pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum. In one patient subglottic stenosis developed that necessitated tracheostomy. Healing began 5 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms, as demonstrated with the use of repeated fibreoptic bronchoscopy. We found that the airway could be safely managed with the use of a nasotracheal tube. Bronchoscopy helped to confirm the diagnosis, to remove adherent secretions and to monitor the course of the disease. The ventilation tube can be removed after the patient's temperature returns to normal, if there is an air leak around the tube, if the quantity and viscosity of the secretions decrease and if healing is observed at bronchoscopy.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to determine whether arterial conductance vessels dilate in response to increased blood flow stimuli, brachial artery area (cm2) and diameter (cm) were derived by simultaneous measurement of forearm blood flow (ml/min.100 ml) and brachial artery blood flow velocity (cm/sec) following the release of arterial occlusion. Measurements were made at rest and at the time of maximal flow after the release of graded periods of forearm arterial occlusion (20 seconds to 10 minutes). These studies showed a graded large vessel dilation following occlusions of up to 1 minute (baseline diameter, 0.33 +/- 0.01; after 1 minute occlusion, 0.45 +/- 0.02 cm; p less than 0.05) after which time diameter plateaued (after 10 minutes of occlusion, 0.48 +/- 0.02 cm). In addition, the time course of diameter and flow changes after 3 minutes of arterial occlusion were examined. Flow was maximal at 5 seconds but diameter was maximal at 15-30 seconds after release. Furthermore, the half time for the return of diameter to baseline was longer than that for blood flow. We also measured the diameter after forearm heating (42 degrees C) and noted a substantial increase in diameter (before heating, 0.32 +/- 0.01; after heating, 0.39 +/- 0.02 cm; p less than 0.05). Finally, we applied pressure to the venous side of arteriovenous fistulae in five hemodialysis patients. This maneuver was associated with large reductions in forearm blood flow (baseline flow, 63.3 +/- 10.6; venous compression flow, 36.0 +/- 4.4 ml/min.100 ml; p less than 0.05) and a decrease in brachial artery size (baseline diameter, 0.63 +/- 0.07; venous compression diameter, 0.58 +/- 0.06 cm; p less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) the human brachial artery size changes in response to changes in blood flow, and 2) the maximal dilation occurs after maximal flow is noted. Although alternate explanations are possible for each of our observations, our results are most consistent with a flow-mediated, localized vasodilating process.\r"

The awareness of the treatment was similar in the IMD (51%) and MSP (59%) groups, but was significantly lower in the T group (37%; p less than .01). The ability to recall the IPPV treatment was reduced in patients with head injuries, those unconscious on admittance, and in elderly individuals. Treatment awareness was found to increase with the duration of the IPPV period in the IMD and T groups. Preoperative information of the treatment, given to elective surgical patients in the MSP group, did not increase treatment awareness.\r"

All of nine dogs that were pretreated with an antagonist survived for 24 h, compared to only five of ten dogs that were not pretreated. Survival correlated with improved BP (mean of 91 vs. 61 mm Hg) and cardiac output (3.9 vs. 2.45 L/min) measured during the first 3 h after the infliction of shock. However, both antagonist-treated and nonantagonist-treated survivors had BP and cardiac output which were statistically lower than their baseline values or saline-treated controls at comparable times. Nonsurvivors had significantly higher levels of norepinephrine (peak level: 1149 ng/ml) and epinephrine (peak level: 31.29 ng/ml) than survivors. Opiate antagonists thus appeared to increase survival in a subgroup of dogs that might not otherwise have survived if they had not been so treated; this survival was associated with improved hemodynamics, but not with increased adrenergic activity.\r"

Myocardial oxygen demand was increased by isoproterenol infusion or atrial pacing, or decreased by beta-receptor blockade. PEEP was set to 15 cm H2O in all groups. The greatest reduction in cardiac output due to PEEP was seen during isoproterenol infusion (44%), and the smallest during beta-receptor blockade (18%). This is attributed to increased sensitivity to the reduced left ventricular (LV) preload induced by PEEP, when cardiac inotropy is augmented by isoproterenol, compared to normal and reduced cardiac inotropy. PEEP decreased MBF similarly and significantly in all groups. However, myocardial oxygen extraction did not increase, and reduction in MBF caused by PEEP was closely related to concomitant reduction in mVO2. A significant correlation was also observed between reductions in LV work and reduction in mVO2 when PEEP was applied in all groups. We conclude that the reduced MBF observed with use of PEEP was probably due to reduced myocardial oxygen demand.\r"

  ".W": "We compared CVP and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (WP) measurements with left atrial pressure (LAP) in postcoronary bypass surgical patients with preserved cardiopulmonary function. Measurements were obtained under normal conditions and conditions likely to induce WP-LAP discrepancies (PEEP and catheter tip malposition). Patients were in both supine and lateral positions; the catheter tip was placed vertically below (tip down; n = 12) or above (tip up; n = 5) the left atrium. Our data showed that both CVP and WP correlated well with LAP at all PEEP levels in the supine and tip down lateral positions. However, in the tip up lateral position, WP overestimated LAP (13.3 +/- 3.4 vs. 8.0 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than .01) at 20 cm H2O of PEEP, whereas CVP (8.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg) closely reflected LAP. Thus, by placing the catheter tip vertically below the left atrium in supinely and laterally positioned patients, CVP and WP both produced reliable estimates of LAP despite an acute increase in alveolar pressure. When the pulmonary artery catheter tip was vertically above the left atrium, WP overestimated LAP. Under these conditions, CVP remained a reliable estimate of LAP. We conclude that CVP measurement as an estimate of LAP in this patient population could be used and not ignored. This is true in patients with previously documented good LAP-CVP correlation who are subjected subsequently to conditions which may produce an LAP-WP discrepancy (high PEEP and catheter tip malposition).\r"

  ".W": "We report our prospective experience with sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and efficiency of echocardiography in diagnosing AD involving the ascending aorta (type A). We studied two groups of patients with both echocardiography and aortography. Group 1 was made up by 46 consecutive patients with clinical suspicion of AD. Type A AD was confirmed in 23 cases. Group 2 was comprised of 509 adult patients who had been studied during the same period with both aortography and echocardiography (including 46 patients from group 1); prevalence of type A AD in this group was 4.9 percent. We conclude that the diagnostic usefulness of echocardiography in patients with suspected type A AD is limited by its moderate sensitivity and predictive positive value. Aortography remains the major step in diagnosis. Within these limitations, echocardiography is useful in confirmation of clinical suspicion if all three main echocardiographic signs are present (predictive positive value: 100 percent).\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of diseases in the chest by MR is continually evolving. Early studies showed the potential of the technique for imaging the mediastinal and hilar structures and for demonstrating the normal anatomy of the thorax on sagittal, coronal, and transverse MR images. As more data have been compiled, investigators have compared MR to computed tomography for its ability to assess mediastinal and hilar adenopathy and masses, bronchogenic carcinoma and other pulmonary parenchyma lesions, and for assessment of the pulmonary vascularity. MR has been shown in these situations generally to provide equivalent information to that provided by computed tomography. MR, compared to computed tomography, is still in its infancy in regard to the length of time of its availability and in relation to the MR technology for obtaining images. MR is a technique that has wide variation as to type of image quality obtained depending upon the MR system utilized and the pulse sequence utilized. Because of the diverse nature of potential variables for imaging, many times the images are not equal in quality. As a consequence of this significant variability, the data in the literature are divergent on the precise utility of MR. Although the recommended use of MR may change rapidly, the current feeling is that MR should be used as a procedure complementary to computed tomography in those patients with allergy to iodinated contrast material and to aid in defining equivocal lesions as seen on computed tomography, such as small central hilar bronchogenic carcinomas.\r"

Exercise testing holds promise as a noninvasive test to predict the physiologic outcome from lung resection.

These patients were divided into five groups based on their x-ray and pulmonary function status; normal, CAO, CAO and pleural disease, pleural disease alone and asbestosis with or without CAO. The P(A-a)O2/VO2(mm Hg)/L of O2 was the most discriminatory measurement of gas transport between groups, with mean values of 14.45 +/- 9.24 for normal, 19.04 +/- 10.52 for CAO, 16.85 +/- 8.94 for CAO and pleural disease and 34.07 +/- 21.54 for asbestosis with or without CAO. The P(A-a)O2/VO2 was of high specificity if greater than 35 mm Hg/L of O2 with only two out of 65 patients without asbestosis being considered abnormal. It was of low sensitivity in that only nine out of 27 patients with asbestosis would be detected if this were the sole criterion for diagnosis.\r"

We used the respiratory inductive plethysmograph to record respiratory timing and minute ventilation along with an ear oximeter to measure oxygen saturation (SaO2). As FEV1 fell during the challenge procedure, SaO2 also fell (average 3 percent). Furthermore, with histamine challenge, expiratory time (Te), inspiratory time (Ti), and breath period (Ttot) all increased; minute ventilation probably also fell. These changes in breathing pattern and SaO2 were reversed by inhalation of a beta 2-agonist. However, no such changes in breathing patterns were observed with methacholine challenge despite a similar fall in FEV1. Bronchial challenge produces hypoxia in stable asthmatic patients, which might result from a combination of hypoventilation with alteration in alveolar ventilation/perfusion relationships.\r"

In normal subjects, MVV/FEV1 was higher than that in asthmatic subjects. Specific conductance (SGaw) increased after a single DI or an MVV maneuver in normal individuals. An MVV maneuver caused SGaw to decrease in asthmatic subjects. In asthmatic subjects, there was a significant correlation between MVV/FEV1 ratio and magnitude of decrease in SGaw after an MVV maneuver. Results of methacholine testing indicated that asthmatic subjects with low MVV/FEV1 ratios were more responsive to methacholine than those whose MVV/FEV1 ratios were within normal range. We conclude that MVV/FEV1 ratios are abnormally low in many asthmatic subjects and that low MVV/FEV1 ratios may indicate increased bronchial responsiveness to methacholine.\r"

Isolation of their corresponding cDNAs has revealed that they are derived from a single gene. In this report a synthetic gene encoding PTHLP-(1-141), a 141-amino acid protein corresponding to the most abundant PTHLP cDNA detected in human tumors, was expressed in bacteria and purified to homogeneity. Recombinant (r) PTHLP-(1-141) migrates with an aberrantly high mol wt on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, presumably as a result of its unusually basic pI. rPTHLP-(1-141), like PTH, induced hypercalcemia in rats, caused release of 45Ca from fetal rat bones, and stimulated the synthesis of cAMP by rat osteosarcoma cells and canine renal membrane preparations. A comparison of the abilities of rPTHLP-(1-141) and bovine PTH-(1-34) to stimulate cAMP synthesis indicated rPTHLP-(1-141) to be 5-fold more potent in the osteosarcoma assay, while nearly 30-fold less active in the renal membrane adenylate cyclase assay. Although 100-fold less potent than bovine PTH-(1-34) in promoting bone resorption, rPTHLP-(1-141) was a potent calcemic factor in vivo, inducing a rise in serum calcium from 10.4 to 14.5 mg/dl when infused into rats at 1.3 micrograms/h. These results support previous assumptions that PTHLP is the humoral factor responsible for humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. In addition, they suggest substantial differences between PTHLP and PTH in the regulation of calcium homeostasis.\r"

  ".W": "In order to assess the possible role of L-arginine accumulation in islet cells as a determinant of its insulinotropic action, the uptake of L-arginine and other cationic amino acids (L-ornithine, L-homoarginine, D,L-alpha-methylornithine, D,L-alpha-difluoromethylornithine) by rat pancreatic islets was compared to the ionic and secretory responses of the islets to the same amino acids. A tight correlation was found between the net uptake of these amino acids and their capacity to stimulate 86Rb efflux, 45Ca uptake and efflux, and insulin release. In the latter respect, there was little difference between metabolized and nonmetabolized amino acids. Thus, although L-homoarginine and 4-amino-1-guanylpiperidine-4-carboxylic acid failed to act as a substrate for either arginase or amino acid aminotransferase in islet homogenates, they both stimulated 86Rb efflux, 45Ca uptake and efflux, and insulin secretion in intact islets. These findings are compatible with the view that the accumulation of these positively charged amino acids in islet cells represents an essential determinant of their secretory action. Hence, the release of insulin evoked by these amino acids could be due to depolarization of the plasma membrane with subsequent gating of voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels and/or to some other biophysical effect, as suggested by the persistence of a sizeable secretory response to L-arginine or L-ornithine in islets perifused at a high concentrations of extracellular K+ (50 mM).\r"

  ".U": "89078234\r", 
  ".W": "Most secretagogues, in addition to their acute stimulatory effect on insulin release, modify the responsiveness of the islet to subsequent stimulations. According to the nature and duration of the stimulus, the generated islet memory may either amplify [time-dependent potentiation, (TDP)] or diminish [time-dependent inhibition (TDI)] the responsiveness of the beta-cell. This work characterizes the kinetic parameters of TDI in the isolated rat pancreas. When subjected to a low dose (8.3 mmol/liter) glucose stimulus, maximal TDI was observed after 5 min of priming, while at a higher dose (16.7 mmol/liter) shorter exposures were sufficient. Longer periods of stimulation (10-40 min) resulted in the predominance of TDP, thus amplifying the release rate. TDI was not affected by previous generation of TDP; 40-min priming with 16.7 mmol/liter glucose markedly augmented the subsequent insulin responses to a pair of 6.9 mmol/liter stimuli, but the response to the second stimulus was inhibited, as in unprimed pancreas. Stimulation with arginine (5.0 mmol/liter) in the presence of basal (3.3 mmol/liter) glucose activated TDI only, and hence revealed monophasic insulin release. Tolbutamide (100 micrograms/ml), glucagon (5 micrograms/ml), and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.1 mmol/liter) also demonstrated TDI when given as a pair of 10-min stimuli; they all elicited monophasic insulin responses during prolonged stimulation. Arginine was chosen for detailed characterization of TDI because of its potency. Using identical concentrations of arginine for the generation and expression of TDI, a similar degree of inhibition (60-80%) was observed at all doses tested (0.5-5.0 mmol/liter). However, there existed competition between TDI and the acute secretory signal. Thus, TDI generated by 1.0 mmol/liter arginine had a minimal effect on insulin release induced by 2.0-5.0 mmol/liter amino acid, while it was fully inhibitory of the response to 1.0 mmol/liter arginine. Similarly, inhibition of the insulin response to 5.0 mmol/liter arginine was dependent on the dose (0.5-5.0 mmol/liter) of the priming pulse of arginine. The generation of TDI was unaffected by the insulin release rate during priming, since synergistic augmentation (combined arginine-glucose or arginine-isobutylmethylxanthine stimulation) or partial inhibition (arginine plus epinephrine) of the response had no effect on the subsequent expression of TDI. It is concluded that TDI and TDP are two distinct regulatory systems that independently control the rate of insulin release, most probably operating through different mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Long term primary rat intermediate pituitary cells cultured in complete serum-free medium (CSFM) were previously shown to exhibit a low basal secretory rate and maintain a stable cellular level of immunoactive pro-ACTH/endorphin (PAE)-related peptides. The present studies used biosynthetic labeling techniques to demonstrate that the biosynthesis of PAE-derived peptides declined as a function of the time the cultures were maintained in CSFM. Compared to hormone biosynthesis in freshly isolated cells, the ability of melanotropes maintained in CSFM to synthesize hormone declined approximately 3-fold after 5 days and 7-fold after 10 days. The endoproteolytic processing of PAE was not changed. This diminution in biosynthetic rate was not observed in serum-supplemented cultures; the rates of hormone secretion and hormone biosynthesis were both substantially higher in cultures maintained in serum-containing medium, suggesting that stimulatory factors were present in serum supplements. Chronic treatment of intermediate pituitary cultures in CSFM with 100 microM (Bu)2cAMP or 100 nM isoproterenol mimicked the effects of serum on total PAE production, hormone biosynthesis, and PAE mRNA levels. The diminished biosynthetic ability of cultures maintained in CSFM for several days could be restored by subsequent chronic (B mu)2cAMP or isoproterenol treatment. Taken together with previous information, these results suggest that melanotropes maintained in CSFM exist in a functionally basal state and that stimulatory agents, in addition to inhibitory inputs such as dopamine, exert significant regulatory control over intermediate pituitary lobe function in vivo.\r"

The sc injection of 10-100 micrograms estradiol benzoate markedly (P less than or equal to 0.01) increased plasma inhibin levels measured 48 h later. Administration of the GnRH agonist [DTrp6,Pro9-NEt]GnRH significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) inhibited both spontaneous and PMSG-induced inhibin secretion, while the GnRH antagonist [Ac-D2Nal1,D4ClPhe2,D3Pal3,Arg5,DGlu6(AA), DAla10]GnRH augmented the stimulatory effect of PMSG action on inhibin release. These results suggest a direct ovarian site of action of sex steroids and GnRH analogs in modulating the release of immunoreactive inhibin. They also support the hypothesis that an endogenous GnRH-like peptide of ovarian origin plays a physiological paracrine role in modulating inhibin secretion in the rat.\r"

  ".U": "89078251\r", 
  ".W": "During the infantile period of development in the bull calf (birth to 6 weeks of age), there is a virtual absence of episodic secretion of LH. Transition from infancy to the prepubertal period (6-10 weeks of age) is characterized by the onset of episodic LH release. This study was conducted to characterize the ontogeny of episodic GnRH release during these developmental periods. During the primary experiment, calves at 2, 5, 8, and 12 weeks of age (n = 4/age) were surgically fitted with cannulae for the collection of mixed hypophyseal portal and cavernous sinus blood. Hypophyseal portal and cavernous sinus and jugular blood samples were collected over a 9- to 12-h period at 10 min intervals. No pulses of LH were observed in calves at 2 or 5 weeks of age. At 8 and 12 weeks of age, pulsatile LH release became evident with a mean of 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 2.20 +/- 0.7 pulses/10 h, respectively. Unlike LH secretion, calves at both 2 and 5 weeks of age released GnRH in a pulsatile manner (3.5 +/- 0.2 and 5.0 +/- 0.6 pulses/10 h, respectively). The frequency of pulsatile GnRH release increased from 7.9 +/- 0.4 pulses/10 h at 8 weeks of age to 8.9 +/- 0.7 pulses/10 h at 12 weeks of age. These findings demonstrate the presence of pulsatile secretion of GnRH during the infantile period of development. Furthermore, the postnatal ontogeny of pulsatile LH release in this species is associated with an increase in the frequency of pulsatile GnRH secretion.\r"

  ".W": "When cDNA for human kidney insulin receptors was used to transfect NIH3T3 mouse fibroblast cells with few or no endogenous insulin receptors, a resultant cell line, 3T3/HIR, expressed more than 6 million receptors/cell. Results of the present study demonstrated that these human receptors in murine cells mediated a diverse group of responses, including insulin binding and internalization as well as insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor and a putative cellular substrate pp185. In addition, the cells were stimulated by insulin in various acute and long term metabolic processes, including glucose transport, glycogen formation, amino acid uptake, and thymidine uptake and incorporation into DNA. There were weak or no responses to insulin in control fibroblasts transfected only with the pSV2Neo plasmid containing a bacterial gene for neomycin resistance (3T3/NEO cells). These findings indicated that transfection of insulin receptor cDNA conferred insulin sensitivity to the target cells in a broad range of cellular responses and further demonstrated that effector molecules for mediating such responses were present in cells that normally lacked sensitivity to this hormone. Expressed receptors readily coupled with the effector systems to become fully functional.\r"

  ".W": "We have examined the regulation of adipogenesis of a 3T3-F442A cell variant. The variant, designated 3T3-GH-independent clone 16 (GI-16), was isolated after serum-induced adipogenic commitment. 3T3-GI-16 fibroblasts displayed a lower serum requirement for adipogenesis than the 3T3-F442A parent cell. Insulin-stimulated adipogenesis of 3T3-GI-16 cells in serum-free medium (SFM) was extensive in the absence of GH, as judged by oil red O staining or glycerol-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase activity, a property not associated with the 3T3-F442A cell. In SFM devoid of GH the concentration of insulin required to promote half-maximal adipogenesis of 3T3-GI-16 fibroblasts was 5 nM. The expression of GH-independent adipogenesis by 3T3-GI-16 cells was not due to exposure to adipogenic stimuli during routine passage, as insulin-stimulated differentiation was not a function of the inoculation density in nonadipogenic cat serum. We noted that nine proteins resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis behaved in a differentiation-dependent manner during adipogenesis of 3T3-GI-16 and 3T3-F442A fibroblasts in SFM. The concentrations of all nine proteins were regulated in a GH-independent manner during insulin-stimulated adipogenesis of 3T3-GI-16 fibroblasts. In contrast, the presence of insulin alone markedly altered the expression of only two of the proteins during differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells. The observed changes in the expression of five presently uncharacterized differentiation-dependent proteins were most likely due to employment of SFM. Our results suggest that expression of GH-independent insulin-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-GI-16 fibroblasts reflects a prior commitment by GH during our selection protocol. These results are discussed in the context of a model in which adipogenesis in vivo is postulated to proceed through the sequential action of GH and insulin on target cells.\r"

Specific binding of [125I]IGF-II to B104 membranes averaged 12.2 +/- 4.0% (mean +/- SD)/100 micrograms/ml protein compared with [125I]IGF-I binding of 10.1 +/- 2.9%. In competitive binding studies employing [125I]IGF-II as the radioligand, high affinity for IGF-II was demonstrated (50% displacement at 2.7 ng/ml), with none for IGF-I or insulin. Upon cross-linking [125I]IGF-I to membranes under reducing conditions, two prominent bands were observed, migrating with apparent mol wt (Mr) of 135,000 and 280,000. Both bands were inhibited by IGFs and insulin, but not by R-II-PABI, a polyclonal antibody to the type 2 receptor. These bands presumably represent the alpha-subunit and an incompletely reduced alpha-alpha-dimer of the type 1 IGF receptor. When cross-linking [125I]IGF-II to membranes under reducing conditions, the primary labeled bands migrated with apparent Mr of 260,000 and 280,000. These bands were inhibited by IGF-II and R-II-PABI, but not by insulin, and probably represent the monomeric type 2 receptor. In addition, we observed a minor band at apparent Mr 35,000, which was inhibited by IGF but not by insulin. By a modified cross-linking technique, we confirmed the existence of a small IGF-binding protein in the serum-free conditioned medium of B104 cultures, migrating as two bands with apparent Mr of 33,000-39,000. These proteins demonstrated high affinity for IGF-I and IGF-II, but none for insulin. In summary, this study demonstrates the presence in B104 rat neuroblastoma cells of 1) abundant classical type 1 and type 2 IGF receptors, and 2) a secreted and membrane-associated small IGF-binding protein.\r"

Animals with elevated serum levels of GH (either bovine GH or mouse GH) have selective splanchnomegaly coupled with glomerular sclerosis and hepatocellularmegaly. Serum levels of insulin and cholesterol are increased. In contrast (with the exception of selective enlargement of organs), the chronic expression of IGF-I results in a different pattern of abnormalities.

PYY and neuropeptide Y (NPY) bound with high affinity to crude membrane preparations from the hippocampus, but their C-terminal fragments bound with 30- to 450-fold lower affinity Guanine nucleotides, especially the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTP gammas inhibited the binding of [125I]PYY, but other transmitters, hormones, and central nervous system-acting drugs did not, except for gangliosides at high concentrations. These results suggest that PYY receptor binding resides in the N-terminal part of the PYY molecule and is coupled to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein. To elucidate PYY receptor structure, we used the cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate to covalently attach [125I]PYY to its receptors in the hippocampus membrane. Gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography revealed a band centered at the mol wt of 50,000. Competitive inhibition of binding by unlabeled PYY resulted in a parallel inhibition of labeling of the 50,000 mol wt protein. The reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol did not affect the appearance of this band, suggesting that the PYY receptor does not have subunits connected by sulfhydryl bonds. Furthermore, cross-linking [125I]NPY to its receptors in the porcine hippocampus produced the same 50,000 mol wt band regardless of 2-mercaptoethanol. The identity in the size of NPY and PYY receptors together with their similarities in binding properties including regional distribution and peptide specificity, indicate that NPY and PYY regulate brain function through interaction at a common receptor site.\r"

  ".U": "89078277\r", 
  ".W": "Tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor and other intracellular proteins in rat adipocytes was examined using an immunoblot technique with antiphosphotyrosine antibody. Insulin at 10(-7) M increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of the 95K subunit of the insulin receptor (15-fold) and proteins of 180K (7-fold) and 60K (23-fold). Increases in insulin-dependent phosphorylation of the three proteins were detectable at 10(-10) M insulin and attained steady state within 30 sec of insulin (10(-7) M) addition. Small effects of insulin (less than 30% increases) were observed on proteins of 120K and 53K. In contrast to insulin, the effects of vanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation were small and nonspecific. Vanadate increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 95K insulin receptor beta-subunit and the 120K and 60K proteins similarly, with increases of 1.5- to 3-fold at 1 mM and 2-fold or less at 200 and 50 microM. Vanadate-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the 180K protein increased to a maximum of only 30% at 200 microM. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 53K protein was somewhat larger, approaching 4-fold at 1 mM vanadate. The concentration of insulin and vanadate that inhibited isoproterenol-dependent lipolysis were not comparable to those that increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Vanadate at 1 mM was more potent as an antilipolytic agent than 10(-9) M insulin (93% vs. 81%), yet increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 95K insulin receptor beta-subunit only as effectively as 10(-10) M insulin (which inhibited lipolysis only 42%). The dissimilar responses were even more pronounced when antilipolysis was compared to tyrosine phosphorylation of the 180K and 60K proteins. For example, insulin at 10(-9) M increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the 180K protein 2.9-fold, while 1 mM vanadate had a negligible effect (10% increase). Thus, vanadate exerts an insulin-like effect on lipolysis, yet its effects on tyrosine phosphorylation differ from those of insulin.\r"

Glucose-inhibitable cytochalasin-B binding was used to estimate the number of glucose transporters. Insulin and exercise caused increases in glucose uptake into the hindlimb muscles of 5- and 3-fold, respectively. Each stimulus also caused a 2-fold increase in the number of glucose transporters in plasma membranes prepared from hindlimb muscles. The insulin-induced increase in plasma membrane transporters was accompanied by a concomitant decrease in transporters from the intracellular pool. In contrast to insulin, there was no concomitant decrease in the number of cytochalasin-B-binding sites in the intracellular membrane fraction from exercised muscles. The ability of both insulin and exercise to increase the number of transporters in the plasma membrane is in accordance with recruitment of transporters as one cause of increased transport activity. However, the inability of exercise to decrease the number of transporters in the insulin-sensitive intracellular pool suggests the existence of either a second recruitable transporter pool or masked glucose transporters in the plasma membrane that are unmasked by the muscle contractile activity.\r"

  ".W": "The maternal plasma concentrations of GH and PRL increase dramatically upon the initiation of lactation in the rat. In light of the fact that these two hormones have evolved from one common precursor, we sought to determine if the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating their concomitant increase during lactation are common or if they are functionally distinct. To evaluate this, lactating rats were passively immunized with antiserum raised against GHRH and then monitored for changes in GH and PRL secretion in response to suckling. On day 9 or 10 postpartum, pups were removed from their mothers at 0800 h. At 1100 h mothers were injected with normal rabbit serum (NRS) or GHRH antiserum (GHRH-ab). At 1400 h a control blood sample was drawn. Pups were then returned to their mothers, with subsequent blood samples drawn over the next 60 min. Plasma concentrations of GH significantly increased to 12.3 +/- 1.0 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) in NRS-treated females after the return of the pups. In contrast, there was no change in GH concentrations in the females treated with the GHRH-ab. Plasma PRL concentrations rose approximately 200 ng/ml in both the NRS-treated animals and the GHRH-ab-treated ones. Body weight gains of the pups during the 60-min period of lactation were similar in both groups. These results suggest that the neuroendocrine mechanisms regulating the increases in GH and PRL during lactation are distinct and that GHRH is the hypothalamic factor responsible for the increase in GH. Furthermore, these results suggest that acutely interrupting the increase in GH secretion that occurs during lactation does not compromise nursing behavior and performance.\r"

Translation of goitrous polysomal Tg mRNA resulted, after immunoprecipitation with polyclonal rabbit antigoat Tg antibodies, in a single 35,000 mol wt (Mr) Tg fragment. To characterize the Tg antigens produced in vivo, thyroid hormone release by the goiter was suppressed by injecting T4 sc in newborn goitrous goats. Immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of Tg antigens almost solely in the colloidal lumen. Electrophoresis of the reduced thyroid proteins demonstrated the presence of two Tg fragments with Mr of 40,000 and 32,000, respectively; the latter is probably a breakdown product of the 40,000 Mr fragment. The difference in Mr between the in vivo and in vitro translation products (40,000 and 35,000 Mr, respectively) can be explained by the carbohydrate content (10% wt/wt) of the in vivo product, as was shown by periodic acid-Schiff-positive staining. Using monoclonal antibodies against the hormonogenic sites at the first and last parts of the Tg molecule, we demonstrated that only the first part of the Tg molecule is present. Both in vivo and in vitro 10% of the goitrous Tg mRNA molecule is translated, resulting in an N-terminal Tg fragment that easily aggregates to large S-S complexes in the colloidal lumen of goiter by H2O2 oxidation.\r"

  ".W": "We previously reported on the degradation of monocomponent porcine insulin by affinity-purified pig skeletal muscle insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and on the detection and HPLC separation of the initial degradation product (peak VI). Using relatively high concentration of insulin, peak VI appeared rapidly at 30 sec of incubation, whereas other peaks were not detected within 5 min of incubation. Performate oxidation studies suggested that peak VI is composed of a cleaved A-chain and an intact B-chain. To assess whether the initial degradation product of insulin generated by IDE preserves biological properties, we analyzed several insulin-like activities of peak VI. It had a hypoglycemic effect on rats. In vitro, it bound to the insulin receptors of rat adipocytes and stimulated glucose oxidation there. It also strengthened insulin receptor kinase activity in insulin receptors from rat liver and human placenta. Its biological potency, however, was 1/40th to 1/160th that of insulin itself. This is probably due to reduced affinity for the insulin receptor, since it had 2.5% of insulin's ability to both bind to the receptor and stimulate glucose oxidation. Moreover, peak VI had all of insulin's agonistic effect on glucose oxidation when used at a higher concentration. On the other hand, cross-linking analysis suggested that peak VI preserves almost the same affinity for IDE as does insulin. These results suggest that pig skeletal muscle IDE may cleave peptide bonds within the A-chain early in insulin degradation, generating peak VI; this then serves as the next substrate of IDE while exerting reduced insulin-like activity, and peak VI is converted to several relatively low mol wt products.\r"

To characterize the effects of ethanol exposure on levels of anterior pituitary pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA, animals were treated with ethanol for either 4 or 7 days. Northern analyses of total RNA extracted from anterior pituitary indicated that ethanol-treated SS mice had 1.5-fold higher pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA levels on day 4 and 2.5-fold higher mRNA levels on day 7 than SS control mice. Although ethanol-treated LS mice had 4-fold higher pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA levels on day 4 compared to those in control LS mice, by day 7 pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA levels in ethanol-treated LS mice were 40% less than LS control levels. Quantitation of pro-ACTH/endorphin-related peptide biosynthesis was determined by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of extracts from [35S]methionine-labeled anterior pituitary explants. Ethanol treatment for 7 days increased pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis in SS mice, but decreased pro-ACTH/endorphin biosynthesis in LS mice. These results parallel the effect of ethanol on pro-ACTH/endorphin mRNA levels. Serum corticosterone levels also paralleled pro-ACTH/endorphin production in both lines of mice. In summary, ethanol acutely activates the HPA axis in SS mice, and this activation is sustained after repeated ethanol administration. In contrast, LS mice have initial activation of the HPA axis, which attenuates after repeated ethanol exposure. LS and SS mice may be appropriate models for understanding the mechanism(s) responsible for the differential activation of the HPA axis by ethanol and the development of pseudo-Cushing's syndrome in man.\r"

Gel chromatography of the extracted material showed a single peak of GRP immunoreactivity. Further high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis resolved the extract into two peaks that closely resembled the C-terminal fragment of GRP, GRP18-27 and GRP14-27. Immunohistochemical studies revealed specific staining for GRP in the Leydig cells of adult rat testis. These results demonstrate, by a number of independent criteria, that rat Leydig cells contain substances which behave like authentic GRP-like peptides. Since the peptides appear to be of local origin, a paracrine function within the rat testis is suggested.\r"

Receptors were isolated under conditions designed to preserve their in vivo phosphorylation state, and their kinase activity toward histone was measured in the absence of in vitro exposure to insulin. Results showed that significant activation of the insulin-receptor kinase occurred after exposure in vivo to mean serum insulin concentrations as low as 34 +/- 3.5 microU/ml and that maximal activation was achieved by insulin levels less than or equal to 2000 microU/ml. There was a highly significant correlation between receptor kinase activity and serum insulin concentration in the physiologic range (r = .92, P less than .0001) and between kinase activity and glucose utilization rate (r = .74, P less than .0001). These findings further support a role for the insulin-receptor kinase in insulin action in vivo, and this model provides a novel method for the study of the effect of factors known to influence insulin action on the insulin-receptor kinase under physiologic conditions.\r"

  ".W": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL3) particles bind to a cell surface receptor, thereby promoting the efflux of cholesterol from extrahepatic nonsteroidogenic cells. This receptor appears to be upregulated by increased cell cholesterol content and also may be responsive to the growth state of cells. Because insulin can be mitogenic, the effect of insulin on HDL-receptor function was tested. HDL-receptor activity of cholesterol-loaded fibroblasts was inhibited by insulin treatment. Insulin decreased HDL binding in a log-dose fashion (-25% at 67 nM insulin) in association with increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from cholesterol-loaded cells was diminished by insulin treatment of cells in parallel with decreased HDL binding. Insulin induced reciprocal changes in HDL- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor activity. In cells in which these receptors were upregulated by varying cell cholesterol content, insulin increased LDL binding (+88%) and decreased HDL binding (-24%). Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I, 100 ng/ml) also significantly decreased HDL binding and HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux to a comparable degree. Pooled human serum similarly induced a reduction in HDL binding to its receptor. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that growth factors in general, and insulin and IGF-I in particular, decrease HDL-receptor activity, possibly to promote retention of cholesterol needed for new membrane synthesis during cell proliferation. Such a mechanism could be partly responsible for accumulation of cholesteryl esters in arterial wall cells during atherogenesis in diabetes mellitus.\r"

Human arterial smooth muscle cells in culture demonstrated the presence of high-affinity receptors for both these hormones. Insulin and IGF-I both exhibited cross-reactivity to each other's receptors but with an affinity that is 100-fold less than for the homologous receptor. To examine more closely the receptor responsible for producing the growth effects, we used the polyclonal antibody against the insulin receptor, B2, and a monoclonal antibody to the IGF-I receptor, alpha IR3. We studied the growth effects of insulin and IGF-I as measured by stimulation of c-myc, DNA synthesis, and cellular proliferation in the presence and absence of these antibodies. F(ab') fragments of the anti-insulin-receptor antibody at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml were capable of displacing greater than 90% of the bound insulin, thus establishing an effective insulin-receptor blockade. Under such blockade, insulin and IGF-I were both capable of doubling the amount of DNA synthesis and cell number in cultured human arterial smooth muscle cells. However, in the presence of a 1:2500 dilution of the monoclonal antibody alpha IR3, which caused a 90% displacement of IGF-I bound to its receptor, both the insulin and IGF-I effects on stimulating DNA synthesis or cellular proliferation were inhibited by greater than 90%. These findings demonstrate that the IGF-I receptor is the common pathway for the growth effects of both insulin and IGF-I.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study, a single transfusion of greater than or equal to 50 x 10(6) cells from either diabetes-resistant (DR) BB/Wor or Wistar-Furth (WF) rats substantially reduced the incidence of diabetes when given to DP rats 27 or 46 days old but not 61 days old. Transfusion and protection were associated with the appearance of RT6+ donor lymph node cells in recipient rats. In vivo depletion of RT6+ T-lymphocytes in 150-day-old protected animals did not produce diabetes. DR BB/Wor and WF spleen cells were equally efficacious when given either intraperitoneally or intravenously. Mitogen-activated spleen cells were relatively less effective than untreated cells. We conclude that BB rat diabetes can be prevented by one transfusion of spleen cells from histocompatible DR and WF donors, and that the protective effect is dependent on recipient age and cell dose. The effect may be mediated by a population of RT6+ T-lymphocytes that, during a critical developmental period, regulate the expression of autoimmunity in these animals.\r"

To ascertain whether insulin responsiveness to glucose, arginine, isoproterenol, forskolin, and K+ varied in a predictable fashion, full concentration-response curves with these agonists were examined with cells from a span of 25 passages. Basal and stimulated cAMP metabolism were also examined. The findings indicate that insulin responses to glucose diminish progressively with increasing passage number and that studies of glucose-induced insulin secretion should be limited to passages 81 and earlier. This defect in insulin secretion is a general rather than a glucose-specific phenomenon in that insulin responses to the other nonglucose secretagogues also diminished with increasing passage number. All changes in glucose-stimulated responses were limited to diminutions in maximal responses; no alterations in apparent half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50s) were observed. In contrast to the continually diminishing insulin responsiveness observed, hormone inhibition by somatostatin of insulin secretion and basal cAMP metabolism remained intact throughout the passages examined. Interestingly, a reciprocal relationship between insulin responsiveness and cAMP responsiveness was observed. Dramatic cAMP responses to isoproterenol and forskolin were observed with the later passages. We conclude that loss of insulin responsivity in HIT cells is a passage-dependent process that is serial rather than sporadic and global rather than glucose specific. Dramatic reciprocal changes in cAMP metabolism occur in the later passages.\r"

  ".W": "The extent to which adult pancreatic beta-cells can respond in vivo to a sustained glucose stimulus by increasing their mass through either hyperplasia or hypertrophy has remained unanswered. Therefore, we studied the in vivo effect of short-term (96-h) hyperglycemia on the growth of beta-cells by infusing adult rats with 35 or 50% glucose or 0.45% saline. After 96 h of glucose infusion, the beta-cell mass, quantified by point-counting morphometrics of immunoperoxidase-stained paraffin sections, showed a 50% increase (9.57 +/- 0.87 mg, n = 5, 50% glucose infused; 9.50 +/- 1.23, n = 7, 35% glucose infused; 6.15 +/- 0.55, n = 6, 0.45% saline infused). This growth was selective for beta-cells; the non-beta-cell mass was unchanged. The mitotic index, measured by accumulated mitotic frequency after a 4-h colchicine treatment, increased fivefold in glucose-infused animals compared to saline-infused animals. This enhanced replication of beta-cells provides evidence for increase in cell number or hyperplasia. In addition, hypertrophy of the beta-cell was also quantified. Mean cell volume, determined from the mean cell cross-sectional area measured planimetrically from low-magnification electron micrographs, increased to 150% of control values after 96 h of 50% glucose infusion. Seven days after the 96-h infusion, in reversal experiments, the beta-cell mass had not returned to saline-infused levels. In addition, the non-beta-cell mass of glucose-infused animals had increased. The mitotic index of the beta-cell of glucose-infused rats was, however, significantly lower than that of the saline controls, but the mean cell volume of the beta-cells remained elevated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, reports have appeared contending that cyclosporin causes glucose intolerance and inhibits pancreatic islet beta-cell function. Consequently, concern has been raised that the beneficial effects of immunosuppression may be offset by adverse metabolic effects of the drug. To address this issue, we examined intravenous glucose tolerance and pancreatic islet beta-cell function in a group of nondiabetic multiple sclerosis patients before and during a 2-yr course of cyclosporin or placebo therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to one of the two drug groups and followed in a double-blind manner. Basal levels of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide as well as glucose disappearance rates and pancreatic islet beta-cell function after stimulation with intravenous glucose and arginine were determined immediately before therapy and after 3 wk, 6 mo, 1 yr, and 2 yr of therapy. No abnormalities in these parameters were observed in the cyclosporin of the placebo-treated group. It appears that cyclosporin can be give in conventional doses for as long as 2 yr without encountering evidence for impaired glucose homeostasis. However, whether adverse effects will materialize over longer periods of drug use remains a question.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the brain in directing counterregulation during hypoglycemia induced by insulin infusion was assessed in overnight-fasted conscious dogs. Concomitant brain and peripheral hypoglycemia was induced in one group of dogs (n = 5) by infusing insulin peripherally at a rate of 3.5 mU.kg-1.min-1. In another group (n = 4), insulin was infused as described above to induce peripheral hypoglycemia, and brain hypoglycemia was minimized by infusing glucose bilaterally into the carotid and vertebral arteries to maintain the brain glucose level at a calculated concentration of 85 mg/dl. Glucose was also infused peripherally as needed so that the peripheral glucose levels in both of the protocols were similar (45 +/- 2 mg/dl with and 48 +/- 3 mg/dl without brain glucose infusion, both P less than .05). The responses (in terms of change of area under the curve) of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and pancreatic polypeptide when brain glycemia was controlled during insulin infusion were only 14 +/- 6, 39 +/- 12, 17 +/- 8, and 9 +/- 4%, respectively, of those present during insulin infusion without concomitant brain glucose infusion (all P less than .05). Of particular interest was the glucagon response that occurred when head hypoglycemia was minimized; the glucagon level was only 21 +/- 8% of that present when marked brain hypoglycemia accompanied insulin infusion (P less than .05). During hypoglycemia resulting from insulin infusion, endogenous glucose production (EGP), as assessed with [3-3H]glucose, rose from 2.6 +/- 0.1 to 4.4 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1 (P less than .05). In contrast, EGP decreased from 2.7 +/- 0.2 to 2.0 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1 when brain hypoglycemia was minimized. In an additional set of studies, when insulin was infused at 3.5 mU.kg-1.min-1 and glucose was infused peripherally to maintain both the head and peripheral glucose concentrations at 88 +/- 6 mg/dl, EGP decreased from 2.6 +/- 0.1 to 1.2 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1. These results suggest that under marked hyperinsulinemic conditions the brain is the primary director of glucagon release and that it is responsible for approximately 75% of the life-sustaining glucose production.\r"

In this study, we demonstrate that insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of calmodulin via insulin receptors partially purified from rat skeletal muscle. Phosphorylation of calmodulin was maximal in the presence of Mg2+ and insulin and the absence of Ca2+. Free-Ca2+ concentrations greater than 0.1 microM progressively inhibited phosphorylation with almost total inhibition at 200 microM Ca2+. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of calmodulin was dose dependent and saturable with half-maximal effect obtained at approximately 5 x 10(-10) M insulin. There was an absolute requirement for certain basic proteins, e.g., polylysine or protamine sulfate, to obtain phosphate incorporation into calmodulin. Polylysine stimulated the phosphorylation of calmodulin independently of insulin, but this was increased up to sixfold by the addition of insulin. Phosphate incorporation into calmodulin increased with increasing concentration of the substrate up to a saturating concentration of 2.4 microM. The Km for calmodulin was approximately 0.2 microM. Up to 0.15 mol of phosphate was incorporated per mole of calmodulin with tyrosine the predominant amino acid phosphorylated. The observations that calmodulin is phosphorylated by insulin-receptor kinase from all three classic target organs for insulin confirm that calmodulin is a general substrate for this kinase and suggest that Ca2+ and calmodulin may be components of the insulin-signaling mechanism.\r"

After 1 yr, all the animals were killed, and the lipid contents in the intimal media of their aortas were determined. Parts of the ascending aortic tissues were further examined by use of either light or electron microscopy. The triglyceride content of the insulin-treated rat aortas was significantly (P less than .05) increased compared with that of the saline-treated rat aortas. As determined by light microscopy, the intimas of the aortas from the insulin-treated rats were significantly (P less than .001) thickened, and the subendothelial tissues consisted of eosinophilic fiber bundles, amorphous ground substances, and irregularly arranged cells. These cells were identified by electron microscopy as having smooth muscle cell origin. All these findings suggest that atherosclerosis-like lesions could be induced by long-term insulin injection in the aortas of the rat and that hyperinsulinism plays a certain role in the development of diabetic macroangiopathy.\r"

To determine whether the error is time-, pool-, model-, or insulin-dependent, glucose turnover was measured simultaneously with [6-3H]-, [6,6-2H2]-, and [6-14C]glucose during a 7-h infusion of either insulin (1 mU.kg-1.min-1) or saline. During the insulin infusion, steady-state glucose turnover measured with both [6-3H]glucose (8.0 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) and [6,6-2H2]glucose (7.6 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) was lower (P less than .01) than either the glucose infusion rate required to maintain euglycemia (9.8 +/- 0.7 mg.kg-1.min-1) or glucose turnover determined with [6-14C]glucose and corrected for Cori cycle activity (9.8 +/- 0.7 mg.kg-1.min-1). Consequently \"negative\" glucose production rates (P less than .01) were obtained with either [6-3H]- or [6,6-2H2]- but not [6-14C]glucose. The difference between turnover estimated with [6-3H]glucose and actual glucose disposal (or 14C glucose flux) did not decrease with time and was not dependent on duration of isotope infusion. During saline infusion, estimates of glucose turnover were similar regardless of the glucose tracer used. High-performance liquid chromatography of the radioactive glucose tracer and plasma revealed the presence of a tritiated nonglucose contaminant. Although the contaminant represented only 1.5% of the radioactivity in the [6-3H]glucose infusate, its clearance was 10-fold less (P less than .001) than that of [6-3H]glucose. This resulted in accumulation in plasma, with the contaminant accounting for 16.6 +/- 2.09 and 10.8 +/- 0.9% of what customarily is assumed to be plasma glucose radioactivity during the insulin or saline infusion, respectively (P less than .01). When corrected for the presence of the contaminant, glucose turnover determined with [6-3H]glucose during insulin infusion (9.5 +/- 0.6 mg.kg-1.min-1) no longer differed from either the glucose infusion rate or that determined with [6-14C]glucose. Therefore, the underestimation of glucose turnover during insulin infusion and negative glucose production rates observed with traditional methods to analyze plasma radioactivity and commercially available tracers is the result of an artifactual increase in [6-3H]glucose specific activity. The etiology of the underestimation of glucose turnover with [6,6-2H2]glucose remains to be determined.\r"

  ".W": "Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDC) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDC) have distinct physicochemical and metabolic properties which, being complementary, should favor more rapid removal of cholesterol from gallstones when both bile acids are administered together. To see if the combination is more effective and well tolerated, we have compared 5 mg/kg of CDC plus 5 mg/kg of UDC with a 10-mg/kg dose of UDC alone in 120 patients with radiolucent, sonographically confirmed gallstones and characteristics favoring complete dissolution. Ursodeoxycholic acid was chosen as the reference because it dissolves stones faster and is better tolerated than CDC. To minimize the influence of stone size, the major determinant of dissolution, patients were divided, on admission, into two groups according to the maximum stone diameter: 50 had stones less than or equal to 5 mm, 70 had stones greater than 5 mm but less than 15 mm. The effects of treatment on stone dissolution evaluated by cholecystography and ultrasonography at 6, 12, and 24 mo, were analyzed by the actuarial life-table method. In the group with smaller stones, significantly more patients had obtained complete dissolution after treatment with the combination (52%) than after treatment with UDC alone (24%) at 6 mo. After longer periods, results were still better with the combination, although the differences from UDC alone became smaller. In the patients with larger stones, rates of complete and partial dissolutions were higher after treatment with the combination (51% vs. 24% with UDC) at 6 mo and again the differences had become smaller after longer treatment. Although not statistically significant, stone calcification occurred more often with UDC (7 cases) than with the combination (1 case). We conclude that CDC plus UDC is preferable to UDC alone because it dissolves stones more quickly, with a lower incidence of stone calcification, and may result in reduced cost of treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Intimate adherence of bacteria to duodenal enterocytes was demonstrated in a 12-mo-old child with sporadic diarrhea that was associated with an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of the serogroup O111:K58. Therefore, a prospective study was initiated to determine if identification of EPEC in stools from sporadic cases of diarrhea of longer than 10 days in duration in children under 24 mo of age correlated with E. coli colonization of the proximal small intestine and with binding of bacteria to intestinal epithelial cells. Colonization was determined by culture of duodenal aspirates and enteroadherence by light- and electron-microscopic evaluation of both duodenal and rectal mucosa. Each EPEC isolate was examined for several previously proposed laboratory markers of virulence including alpha-hemolysin production, agglutination of erythrocytes, cell surface hydrophobicity properties, adherence to HEp-2 cells, and Verotoxin production. Ten sporadic cases of EPEC-associated diarrhea, severe enough to require hospitalization in each instance, were present among 105 patients in whom EPEC were identified in stools. Of the 10 cases, 9 were evaluated in more detail. In contrast to the first case, in the prospective study E. coli were cultured from duodenal aspirates in only 1 patient and enteroadherent organisms were not present on careful review of small bowel (0/9) and rectal (0/7) mucosa. Hemolysin production (9 of 10 EPEC strains), mannose-sensitive hemagglutination (7/10), hydrophobic cell surface properties (0/10), adherence to HEp-2 cells (7/10), and production of Verotoxin (0/10) did not distinguish the one enteroadherent EPEC from the nine EPEC strains in which in vivo enteroadherence was not documented. In this study of sporadic cases of EPEC-associated diarrhea in young children, bacterial colonization of the small bowel and enteroadherence in vivo could not routinely be demonstrated. In addition, those laboratory assays of bacterial virulence that were evaluated did not distinguish the adherent strain from nonadherent EPEC strains.\r"

  ".W": "Active immunization of rabbits with the principal, endogenous prostaglandins in the gastrointestinal mucosa induces gastrointestinal mucosal ulceration. Development of ulceration in prostaglandin-immunized rabbits appears to be a direct consequence of production of specific prostaglandin antibodies, as prostaglandin antibodies per se induce gastric ulceration within 9 days when administered intravenously to unimmunized rabbits. These studies suggest that endogenous prostaglandin E2, F2 alpha, D2, and I2 in the gastrointestinal tract play an important role in preventing mucosal ulceration. The mechanism of ulcer formation is not completely understood, but most evidence points toward prostaglandin antibodies inducing mucosal ulceration by binding to endogenous prostaglandins within the mucosa and thereby negating their mucosal protective effects. Gastric acid hypersecretion and complement fixation by prostaglandin-antiprostaglandin complexes are not likely involved in the development of mucosal ulceration in this model. Use of antibodies to interfere with prostaglandin action may be an alternative approach to investigate (a) the importance of endogenous prostaglandins in mediating mucosal protective mechanisms and (b) the role of prostaglandins in acute and chronic erosive/ulcerative diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\r"

We review the data and propose mechanisms that implicate C. pylori as an important factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease and consider the therapeutic implications. What we now know about C. pylori begins to unravel some of the mysteries surrounding peptic ulcer disease.\r"

The majority of patients dying from peptic ulceration have no symptoms of ulcer disease until the presentation of their final, fatal illness. There is a need for more studies investigating the early symptoms of the fatal ulcer disease, the effects of therapies that may prevent fatalities, and the management of potentially lethal ulcer disease upon clinical presentation. Silent ulceration also occurs in patients after successful healing with medical treatment, and the apparent point prevalence of silent ulceration (in the framework of a clinical trial) is critically dependent on the frequency of repeat endoscopic examination and the treatment modality. Maintenance treatment with H2-receptor antagonists appears to some extent to decrease the frequency of asymptomatic ulcers, but more interestingly to halt the progression of asymptomatic ulcers toward symptomatic or complicated ulceration, although more careful studies in comparison with other modalities are needed.\r"

The most likely candidate mechanism to account for these differences is an alteration in gastric secretion, which might arise from alterations in gastrin, altered receptor regulation, parietal cell sensitivity, or peptic activity. However, the evidence for such an alteration in secretion is far from conclusive. Other factors that may be important include mucosal defense factors, smoking, Campylobacter pylori, and the statistical methodology.\r"

Nevertheless, from published studies most gastric and duodenal ulcers associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs appear to heal on antacids or H2-antagonists. Sucralfate appears useful for duodenal but not gastric ulcers. Continuing nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs does not prevent or delay healing of duodenal or small gastric ulcers; their effects on large gastric ulcers remain uncertain. Thus far, only full doses of H2-antagonists, or their combinations with antacids, have been shown to heal ulcers and prevent recurrences. Ulcer recurrences and complications have occurred in small numbers of patients on maintenance doses of H2-antagonists. Available antiulcer drugs (antacids, H2-antagonists, sucralfate) reduce severe acute injury when taken before or with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. They also reduce ulcerlike symptoms due to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Inexplicably, chronic prophylaxis with H2-antagonists for 4 wk or more appears ineffective in preventing gastric ulcers, although duodenal injury is reduced. As the efficacy of available prophylactic therapy (H2-antagonists, sucralfate, and antacids) has not been established, routine use in all cases seems unjustified at present.\r"

More than 10% of patients receiving NSAIDs chronically will have a gastric ulcer on any given day, a point prevalence of ulcer disease 5-10 times higher than in patients who are not taking NSAIDs. Endoscopic studies comparing the effect of acute administration of NSAIDs on the gastroduodenal mucosa in normal volunteers have failed to predict which NSAIDs would be safest when administered chronically. All of the newer NSAIDs appear to be similar in their propensity to cause chronic mucosal damage, including peptic ulceration. Recent studies have suggested that in those starting NSAID therapy, prophylactic cotreatment with H2-receptor antagonists or sucralfate has minimal or no effect on preventing the development of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, although duodenal ulcers may be reduced. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastric ulcers are also not prevented by drug formulations that prevent or markedly reduce the amount of active NSAID in the stomach. Cotreatment with the synthetic prostaglandin misoprostol was associated with a marked reduction in gastric ulcer development in patients with osteoarthritis receiving NSAIDs chronically, suggesting that prevention of prostaglandin generation in the gastric mucosa may play a pivotal role in NSAID-induced gastric ulcers.\r"

In this study we examined whether physiological changes in plasma insulin concentrations regulate IGF-BP and, if so, whether the regulation is influenced by race, glucose tolerance, or rate of glucose metabolism. For these purposes we 1) analyzed the relationship between fasting plasma insulin and IGF-BP concentrations in 2 racial groups (23 caucasians and 35 southwestern American Indians), 2) measured the response of plasma IGF-BP to oral glucose in 20 normal subjects, and 3) determined the dose-response characteristics of plasma IGF-BP to glucose and insulin in 23 normal subjects at 4 different insulin and glucose concentrations. The fasting plasma insulin concentration was inversely related to the plasma IGF-BP concentration in both the caucasian and Indian groups (P less than 0.0001). In the caucasian group the mean plasma IGF-BP concentration was higher [15 +/- 4 (+/- SE) micrograms/L] than in the Indian group (8 +/- 2 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05). This difference was independent of race and glucose tolerance, and it could be explained by lower plasma insulin concentrations in the caucasian (387 +/- 50 pmol/L) than in the Indian group (215 +/- 43 pmol/L; P less than 0.001). After oral glucose administration, the insulin concentration (423 +/- 72 pmol/L) was maximal 30 min after glucose treatment, and significant suppression of the IGF-BP concentration occurred at 90 min. Analysis of the dose-response curves revealed maximal suppression of IGF-BP at about 1150 pmol/L insulin, and half-maximal suppression at about 290 pmol/L. The plasma glucose concentration or the rate of glucose metabolism had no effect on the IGF-BP concentration. These data suggest that insulin is a major regulator of plasma IGF-BP concentrations under physiological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the response of serum 34K insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGF-BP) to two types of prolonged exercise. In the first study, 11 normal men performed cycle ergometer exercise, after an overnight fast, for 3 h at the intensity corresponding to 45-50% of their maximal aerobic power. After the exercise, the mean serum IGF-BP concentration was 4.9-fold higher than the baseline level (P less than 0.01), while the IGF-I concentration did not change. Resting for the same time period resulted in a 38% fall in the serum IGF-BP level (P less than 0.01). In the second study, 10 normal men and 8 type 1 diabetic men exercised, on the average, for 7.5 h in a 75-km cross-country ski race. The mean serum IGF-BP concentration increased 5.4-fold (P less than 0.01) in the normal men and 4.2-fold (P less than 0.01) in the diabetic men. The serum IGF-I concentration decreased by 19% and 21% in the normal and diabetic men, respectively (P less than 0.01). After completion of the ski race, the serum insulin and IGF-BP levels (r = -0.70; P less than 0.05), and serum IGF-I and IGF-BP levels (r = -0.72; P less than 0.05) were inversely correlated in the normal men. No such correlations were found in the diabetic men. We conclude that 1) long term exercise increases serum IGF-BP concentrations in both normal and type 1 diabetic men; and 2) the increases are inversely related to alterations in serum IGF-I and insulin concentrations in normal men. These data suggest that IGF-BP may be involved in regulation of the biological action of IGF-I during prolonged exercise.\r"

Renin substrate, albumin, transferrin, and immunoglobin G were also found in these ocular fluids. In many samples renin levels were close to the detection limit of the assay. The levels of renin substrate, albumin, transferrin, and immunoglobulin G varied widely among ocular fluid samples, but in each individual sample the levels were, relative to each other, similar to those in plasma. In contrast, the prorenin level in ocular fluid was up to 100 times higher than expected on the basis of the plasma protein content of ocular fluid. Moreover, there was little difference in prorenin concentrations between samples with low and high plasma protein contents. Prorenin, relative to albumin and other plasma proteins, was higher in vitreous fluid from eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy complicated by traction retinal detachment than in eyes of nondiabetic subjects with spontaneous retinal detachment. It appears that prorenin (and possibly renin) in ocular fluid is controlled by an active and specific process, possibly local synthesis within the eye. In view of the vascular actions of angiotensin II, an intraocular renin-angiotensin system may play a role in diabetic retinopathy.\r"

  ".W": "We studied a group of obese hyperandrogenic amenorrheic women to determine the effects of weight loss on anthropometry, hormonal status, menstrual cycles, ovulation, and fertility. Fourteen women had polycystic ovaries, two the hyperandrogenism-insulin resistance-acanthosis nigricans syndrome, one hirsutism of adrenal origin, and three idiopathic chronic anovulation. The duration of amenorrhea before the study ranged from 3-17 months [mean, 8.6 +/- 4.5 (+/- SD)]. All women ate a hypocaloric diet for a period of 8.0 +/- 2.4 months. Weight loss ranged from 4.8 to 15.2 kg (mean, 9.7 +/- 3.1 kg; 1.35 +/- 0.56 kg/month) and the waist to hip ratio, which was used as a measurement of body fat distribution, decreased from 0.86 +/- 0.1 to 0.81 +/- 0.06 (P less than 0.0001). The women's mean plasma testosterone and LH concentrations decreased significantly (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.005, respectively). A significant positive correlation was found between the decreases in plasma testosterone levels and the decreases in glucose-stimulated insulin levels. Moreover, the decreases in the waist to hip ratio correlated positively with the decreases in glucose-stimulated insulin levels and inversely with the decreases in plasma 17 beta-estradiol. No relationships were found between weight loss and the changes in plasma insulin, steroid, and gonadotropin concentrations. The responsiveness to the weight reduction program was evaluated by comparing the number of menstrual cycles during the study period with the number reported before it. Eight women had significantly improved menstrual cyclicity (responders), while 12 did not (nonresponders). The clinical characteristics and hormone values were similar in responder and nonresponder women. In the group as a whole, 33% of the menstrual cycles during the study were ovulatory, and 4 pregnancies occurred. Hirsutism improved significantly in more than half of the women, as did acanthosis nigricans when present. We conclude that weight loss is beneficial in all obese hyperandrogenic women regardless of the presence of polycystic ovaries, the degree of hyperandrogenism, and the degree and distribution of obesity.\r"

In 10 normal men, venous blood was sampled on 2 occasions at 10-min intervals for 8 h, beginning 30 min after oral administration of either placebo or 0.3 mg clonidine according to a randomized double blind protocol. Compared to placebo, clonidine induced a marked release of GH (P less than 0.0001 for response areas under the curve after placebo and clonidine), a fall in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and in heart rate (P less than 0.002 for areas under the curve after placebo and clonidine), and feelings of sedation and dry mouth (P less than 0.002 and P less than 0.05 for areas under the cumulative scores for changes in alertness and salivation, respectively). There was no difference between the results obtained after placebo and clonidine for the mean number of LH pulses [3.3 +/- 0.4 (+/- SE) and 3.3 +/- 0.3 pulses/8 h], for the mean amplitude of all LH pulses (3.8 +/- 0.4 and 4.1 +/- 0.5 IU/L), or for the areas under the LH concentration-time curve (2741 +/- 251 and 2728 +/- 215 IU/L.min). The lack of effect of clonidine on LH secretion at a dose that effectively induced GH secretion and other centrally mediated effects indicates that the actions of testosterone and opiates to decelerate the frequency of the LHRH pulse generator in men are not mediated by diminished alpha-adrenergic stimulation. From these results, taken together with previous data, we conclude that alpha-adrenergic systems do not play a major role in the regulation of episodic LH release in men.\r"

However, in preliminary studies, serum antireceptor antibodies were not detected in an assay that measures the ability of the antibodies to inhibit insulin binding to the insulin receptor. Antireceptor antibodies were subsequently detected by their ability to immunoprecipitate affinity-labeled receptors. After the patient had received immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone and cyclophosphamide for 3 months, her insulin resistance remitted, and she developed hypoglycemia. Simultaneously with the remission of insulin resistance, the titer of serum antireceptor antibody (measured by the immunoprecipitation assay) fell to less than 1% of the previous level. In a series of 21 patients, this is the first patient with antireceptor antibodies that bound to the insulin receptor without inhibiting insulin binding.\r"

  ".W": "GH has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various acute and chronic complications of diabetes mellitus. As a consequence, there has been a great deal of interest in developing methods for suppressing GH secretion in diabetes. SMS 201-995 is a long-acting somatostatin analog which inhibits the secretion of numerous hormones, including GH. To determine the metabolic and hormonal responses to SMS 201-995 independent of endogenous insulin suppression, we studied six patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus while they received 150 micrograms SMS 201-995, sc, daily for an 8-week period. This treatment resulted in no change in 24-h glucose profiles, although the mean insulin dose decreased by 19%, while hemoglobin A1c decreased significantly (0.084 +/- 0.023 to 0.067 +/- 0.011, P = 0.04). The 24-h profiles of blood lactate, plasma free insulin, glucagon, FFA, blood glycerol, and beta-hydroxybutyrate were unchanged, whereas that of blood alanine increased significantly (7.8 +/- 0.4 to 10.6 +/- 0.9 mmol/L.h; P = 0.01). GH secretion declined in five of the six patients; the mean values before and during SMS 201-995 treatment were 102 +/- 23 and 68 +/- 12 micrograms/L.h, respectively (P = NS), for the six patients. [In the five patients in whom GH secretion declined, the mean values before and during SMS 201-995 treatment were 115 +/- 23 and 63 +/- 14 micrograms/L.h, respectively (P = 0.01).] These results suggest that SMS 201-995 may be administered to patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus without a deleterious effect on metabolic control.\r"

Infusion of propranolol or phentolamine did not alter basal plasma ACTH or cortisol levels. The propranolol infusion enhanced the stimulatory effect of hypoglycemia on ACTH, cortisol, and AVP secretion and also enhanced the stimulatory effect of CRH on ACTH and cortisol secretion. Infusion of phentolamine inhibited hypoglycemia-induced ACTH and AVP secretion, but had no effect on the stimulatory effect of CRH on ACTH and cortisol secretion. The increments of plasma ACTH and cortisol induced by an almost maximal dose of CRH (1 microgram/kg) were smaller than those induced by hypoglycemia. The propranolol-induced enhancement of the ACTH response to hypoglycemia was almost the same as the ACTH response to CRH alone. From these results we conclude that propranolol may act at the pituitary level to enhance CRH action, rather than AVP action, and that the ACTH response to hypoglycemia may be mediated by hypothalamic alpha-adrenergic activation.\r"

  ".U": "89079847\r", 
  ".W": "We examined the role of the plasma glucose concentration per se in the secretion of counterregulatory hormones during exercise. Ten men (average age, 24 yr; maximal aerobic capacity, 31.8 mL/kg.min) were studied during two 50-min bicycle exercise periods at either normal glucose [87 +/- 1 (+/- SE) mg/dL (4.8 +/- 0.1 mmol/L)] or low glucose [59 +/- 1 mg/dL (3.3 +/- 0.1 mmol/L)]. The plasma glucose targets were achieved by exogenous insulin and variable glucose infusions. These results were compared to studies in which saline was infused. Exercise at normal glucose was associated with significant increments in plasma epinephrine (maximum 3- to 5-fold above baseline) and norepinephrine (2-fold), comparable to those that occurred during saline administration. Plasma GH increased only at the most intense exercise level, while plasma cortisol and glucagon did not increase significantly. In low glucose-exercise studies, the increase in plasma epinephrine during exercise was significantly greater than that at normal glucose (P less than 0.01), although proportional to basal preexercise levels (r = 0.73; P less than 0.001). Plasma glucagon increased almost 100%, and plasma cortisol and GH increased by 150% and 400%, respectively. Compared to the effect of the same degree of hypoglycemia in the absence of exercise, only plasma epinephrine (P = 0.002) and norepinephrine (P less than 0.001) displayed effects independent of hypoglycemia during exercise. When low glucose was reversed to normal at the midpoint of exercise, plasma epinephrine and glucagon returned to the levels obtained for the same duration of exercise at normal glucose, while norepinephrine, GH, and cortisol were only partially responsive to the rise in plasma glucose. These data suggest that 1) moderate exercise is a stimulus for a sympathoadrenal and GH response, but not a peripheral glucagon response; 2) during exercise and hypoglycemia, plasma epinephrine and norepinephrine are enhanced, while the glucagon response is entirely glucose dependent; and 3) the epinephrine response to hypoglycemia can be dissociated from that to exercise, suggesting differing control mechanisms. We conclude that the activation of counterregulatory hormones during exercise is regulated by glucose-independent mechanisms, although these responses may be augmented by concurrent hypoglycemia.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis of a defect in GH-receptor interaction, which could explain the growth failure of thalassemic children, the binding of [125I]human (h) GH to membrane fractions prepared from liver biopsies was studied. Small amounts of liver were obtained from 6 girls and 11 boys with homozygous beta-thalassemia, aged 3-15 yr, all prepubertal, at the time of splenectomy. Specific binding of [125I]hGH ranged from 0.37-5.11% of the added radioactivity/100 micrograms liver membrane protein, with variations in both receptor number and binding affinity. This 14-fold variation in hGH binding to liver membranes of thalassemic children was comparable to that in membrane fractions of livers obtained from normal donors at the time of liver transplant. The binding of insulin to liver membranes from the thalassemic patients ranged from 9.8-17.9% of the added radioactivity/100 micrograms membrane protein and from 2.8-15.0%/100 micrograms membrane protein in the normal donors. Insulin and GH binding to liver membranes did not vary in a consistent way. A 3-fold difference was found in 5'-nucleotidase activity of the membrane fractions. Histological hepatic modifications were assessed with respect to siderosis and fibrosis. No correlation was found between these parameters and GH binding. These results suggest that possible membrane alterations are not the only reason for the variations in hGH binding. All patients had retarded growth, and all but 2 had low plasma insulin-like growth factor I levels. No relationship was found between the level of GH binding to liver membranes and the growth failure. Thus, a defect in GH binding to liver membranes is probably not the cause of the growth retardation of thalassemic children.\r"

Only digoxin increased cardiac index by 23% (p = 0.03) and stroke work index by 52% (p = 0.01). During maximal exercise, captopril alone decreased systemic vascular resistance by 28% (p = 0.0002) and increased cardiac index by 33% (p = 0.02). Digoxin alone decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure by 11% (p = 0.04) and increased stroke work index by 44% (p = 0.01). The combination of captopril and digoxin resulted in a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance and an increase in cardiac index and stroke work index both at rest and during exercise that was greater than values observed with either drug given alone. Cardiac index response to the combination of captopril and digoxin correlated with baseline serum aldosterone concentration (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) and plasma renin activity (r = 0.74, p less than 0.0002). A significant decrease in norepinephrine concentration was noted after digoxin was administered alone or added to captopril. These findings demonstrate that in patients with severe heart failure, the acute administration of captopril and digoxin has an independent salutary hemodynamic effect. The combination of these agents, however, has an adjunctive effect on cardiac function at rest and during exercise.\r"

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antimyosin for identifying acute transmural infarction, 50 patients with acute Q wave myocardial infarction were entered into a phase I/II multicenter trial involving three clinical sites. Indium-111 antimyosin was prepared from an instant kit formulation containing 0.5 mg of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA)-coupled Fab fragment (R11D10) and 1.2 to 2.4 mCi of indium-111. Average labeling efficiency was 92%. Antimyosin was injected 27 +/- 16 h after the onset of chest pain. Planar or tomographic imaging was performed 27 +/- 9 h after injection in all patients, and repeat imaging was done 24 h later in 39 patients. Of the 50 patients entered, 46 showed myocardial uptake of antimyosin (sensitivity 92%). Thirty-one of 39 planar scans performed at 24 h were diagnostic; 8 showed persistent blood pool activity that cleared by 48 h. Focal myocardial uptake of antimyosin corresponded to electrocardiographic infarct localization. No patient had an adverse reaction to antimyosin. In addition, 125 serum samples, including 21 collected greater than 42 days after injection, were tested for human antimouse antibodies, and all samples were assessed as having undetectable titers. Intensity of antimyosin uptake was correlated with infarct location and the presence or absence of collateral vessels. There was a significant correlation between faint uptake and inferoposterior infarct location. In 21 patients who had coronary angiography close to the time of antimyosin injection, there was a significant correlation between faint tracer uptake and closed infarct-related vessel with absent collateral flow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Images were obtained in real time with a modified two-dimensional ultrasound system capable of providing continuous signals in proportion to the logarithm of integrated backscatter along each A line. In 15 patients, adequate parasternal long-axis images that delineated both normal and infarct segments were obtained with standard time-gain compensation. Image data were analyzed to yield both magnitude and delay (electrocardiographic R wave to nadir normalized for the QT interval) of the cyclic variation of backscatter. Cyclic variation was present in 55 of 56 normal myocardial sites, averaging (mean +/- SEM) 3.2 +/- 0.2 dB in magnitude and exhibiting a mean normalized delay of 0.87 +/- 0.03. The magnitude of cyclic variation in infarct segments was significantly reduced to 1.1 +/- 0.2 dB (42 sites), and the delay was markedly increased to 1.47 +/- 0.12 (21 sites) (p less than 0.0001 for both). In 20 of 42 infarct sites, no cyclic variation was detectable. Thus, ultrasound tissue characterization quantitatively differentiated infarct segments from normal myocardium in patients with remote myocardial infarction.\r"

However, some bulimic individuals restrict caloric intake rather than purge as a means of controlling their weight. Treatment may include psychiatric evaluation, drug therapy, and nutrition counseling. This study evaluated the eating pattern of a bulimic woman from food records made before and while she was receiving nutrition counseling at an eating disorders clinic. Energy expenditure was also determined and examined in relation to patterns of eating behavior. The Harris-Benedict equation was used to estimate basal energy expenditure (BEE). Actual measured energy expenditure (MEE) was determined by indirect calorimetry. On initial assessment, this woman was eating 600 to 3,800 kcal/day, reflecting the range from a semi-fast to a binge day. At this time, her BEE was significantly higher than her MEE. Following modification of her eating pattern to three meals a day, providing approximately 1,200 kcal, there was a 50% increase in her MEE, which closely approximated her BEE. Modification of eating pattern appeared to be associated with a normalization of energy expenditure in this woman; however, each case must be considered individually. These results imply that certain eating patterns in bulimic individuals cause a decrease in energy expenditure that may resemble starvation.\r"

One factor is an immunization failure rate in the elderly that may be as high as 50%. To test whether administration of thymosin alpha 1 would result in greater antibody production, we administered it (900 micrograms/m2 subcutaneously twice weekly for eight doses) in conjunction with the 1986 trivalent influenza vaccine. Ninety men (65-99 years old, mean age 77.3 years) were randomized double-blind to receive thymosin alpha 1 or placebo by the same schedule; the sera from 85 of these men were acceptable for analysis. The two groups were similar with respect to underlying disease, medications, and age. No toxicity was observed in either group. Antibody response rate was defined as a four-fold rise in antibody titer over 3-6 weeks following vaccination and was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Analysis was performed on treatment groups and subgroups divided by the mean age: the older group consisted of subjects aged 77 years and older, and the younger group those aged from 65-76 years. Baseline and change in absolute antibody levels were compared by t test and using age as a continuous variable by multiple regression analysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The diagnostic accuracy of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was evaluated against a standardized psychiatric interview. The MMSE was found to be 81% sensitive and 83% specific in screening for dementia using a previously established cutpoint of less than 24/30 points. Adjusting MMSE scores for physical disabilities precluding completion of specific tasks on the MMSE did not significantly change the diagnostic accuracy of the test. The GDS was 47% sensitive and 75% specific in screening for depression using the suggested cutpoint of greater than 13/30 points. The MMSE was significantly correlated with functional status (r = 0.48, P = .0001), but not with the scores on the GDS or the clinical diagnosis of depression. The GDS did not correlate with functional status. In summary, the MMSE is a good screening test for dementia in institutionalized elderly, but the GDS is not sensitive for depression in this population.\r"

We now describe the establishment and characterization of a novel human leukemic cell line that recapitulates the pre-B to B cell stage of differentiation. This cell line, designated BLIN-1, was initially established in tissue culture medium containing low m.w. B cell growth factor, and consistently shows a dependency on this cytokine for optimal growth at low density. BLIN-1 cells have a 9p chromosomal abnormality, identical to the abnormality present in the leukemic blasts from the patient's original bone marrow aspirate. The immunologic phenotype of BLIN-1 is consistent with a cell arrested at the pre-B cell stage of development. Analysis of Ig gene rearrangement and Ig expression in a series of BLIN-1 subclones show that the cells spontaneously rearrange kappa light chain genes, leading to the differentiation of surface kappa-negative pre-B cells into surface kappa-positive B cells. The BLIN-1 cell line is, to our knowledge, the first defined human model for examining this critical developmental stage in human B cell ontogeny. As such, it offers a unique resource for examining variables influencing onset of kappa L chain gene rearrangement and expression.\r"

IL-6 was found to bind plasma proteins and an immunoblot analysis revealed that the complex between IL-6 and plasma proteins contains alpha 2M. Furthermore, purified alpha 2M bound IL-6. alpha 2M did not inhibit IL-6 activity or its binding to homologous receptor. IL-6 bound to alpha 2M retained its biologic activity and became resistant to treatment with proteases, although free IL-6 was easily degraded. These findings indicate that alpha 2M plays an important role as a carrier protein for IL-6 in serum and makes IL-6 produced at the local inflammatory site available to lymphocytes, hepatocytes, and hematopoietic stem cells, resulting in the induction of the coordinate systemic host defense reactions, such as immune response, acute phase reaction, and hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Macrophage differentiation is accompanied by the acquisition of both Ag presentation and tumoricidal activities. In this set of experiments, the expression of IL-1 by bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) was found to be highly regulated, with both the expression of IL-1 mRNA and mIL-1 appearing only at discrete stages of activation. The accumulation of IL-1 alpha (membrane) mRNA was induced by endotoxin but not IFN-gamma or CSF-1. mIL-1 was detected by D10.G4.1 T cells on BMDM only after 7 days of in vitro differentiation. Secreted IL-1 beta was detected by day 3 of culture, with enhanced production observed after activation with endotoxin. IL-1 beta mRNA was found to be constitutively expressed in BMDM as early as day 3 of culture. The expression of IL-1 beta mRNA was up-regulated by endotoxin after 30 min of exposure with maximal expression occurring after 2 to 6 h of exposure. Constitutive expression of IL-1 alpha mRNA was not detected but 1 h of endotoxin exposure resulted in the appearance of IL-1 alpha transcripts. As with IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha mRNA was also constitutively expressed during a wide time period of differentiation; however, in contrast, to IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha mRNA expression was up-regulated by both endotoxin and IFN-gamma. The expression of TNF-alpha macrophage by BMDM coincided with the acquisition of tumoricidal activity. An examination of the mRNA sequences encoding the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-fms demonstrated the expression of c-myc only on day 3, whereas c-fms was constitutively expressed throughout the culture period. Endotoxin stimulation of BMDM resulted in a transitory increase in c-myc expression only at day 3 of culture, whereas endotoxin had no effect on c-fms expression until 7 days of culture at which time expression declined. In contrast, the expression of transferrin receptor mRNA transcripts, which were also constitutively expressed throughout the entire culture period, were not affected by stimulation with either endotoxin or IFN-gamma. These results indicate BMDM expression of the affector molecules IL-1 alpha and beta and the effector molecule TNF-alpha are regulated separately during unique \"differentiation-specific\" phases of development.\r"

However, bacteria become avirulent and sensitive to C-mediated killing upon thermal inhibition of TS KDO-8-phosphate synthetase (incubation at 38 degrees C) or TS cytidine monophosphate-KDO synthetase (incubation at 42 degrees C). Such thermal inhibition concurrently causes synthesis of an altered outer membrane which we now show is the site that renders cells susceptible to C-mediated killing. After incubation of cells in serum, the altered outer membrane area contains C9 in a trypsin-resistant state and membrane attack complex (MAC) lesions observable by electron microscopy. Trypsin-resistant C9 and MAC lesions were also observed in the inner membrane fraction from such serum-treated cells. In contrast, little C9 and few MAC lesions were associated with unaltered outer membrane areas present on these same serum treated cells. Control cells, grown at 30 degrees C and treated with serum (1) bound one-fifth as much C9 as was bound to cells incubated at 42 degrees C, (2) contained only a rare MAC lesion in the outer membrane, and (3) no observable MAC lesions in the inner membrane. We conclude that the altered outer membrane area is the site that renders cells susceptible to insertion of the MAC into both the outer and inner membrane resulting in cell death.\r"

  ".W": "In this report we present data on the ability of the different Fc gamma R present on eosinophils to mediate killing of erythroid and tumor targets, and on a comparison of eosinophil and neutrophil Fc gamma R-mediated killing. Erythroid target killing was assessed using chicken erythrocytes (CE) and heteroantibodies composed of Fab fragments of anti-CE antibodies covalently coupled to Fab fragments of anti-Fc gamma R antibodies. Such anti-CE x anti-Fc gamma R reagents permit linkage of CE target cells with the FcR molecules on the eosinophil or neutrophil effector cells. Tumor target killing was assessed using hybridoma cell lines (HC) bearing anti-Fc gamma R antibodies on their cell surface. Freshly isolated eosinophils and neutrophils constitutively express similar amounts of the low affinity Fc gamma R, Fc gamma RII on their cell surface, but neither cell type expresses the high affinity Fc gamma R, Fc gamma RI. In contrast, eosinophils have only about 5% as much of the low affinity Fc gamma R found on human granulocytes and large granular lymphocytes (Fc gamma RIII) as neutrophils. Untreated, freshly prepared eosinophils or neutrophils did not lyse any of the anti-Fc gamma R bearing HC nor did they lyse CE in the presence of anti-Fc gamma R containing heteroantibodies. Upon treatment with granulocyte monocyte-CSF (GM-CSF), both cell types lysed HC-bearing antibody to Fc gamma RII (HC IV.3A) and CE in the presence of anti-CE x anti-Fc gamma RII heteroantibodies. However, neither cell type lysed HC-bearing antibody to Fc gamma RI or Fc gamma RIII, or CE in the presence of anti-CE x anti-Fc gamma RI HA. Treatment with GM-CSF did not significantly alter the number of Fc gamma R on either cell type. Treatment of neutrophils with IFN-gamma for 18 h induced the expression of Fc gamma RI on these cells and their ability to lyse anti-Fc gamma RI- or Fc gamma RII-bearing HC and CE through Fc gamma RI, Fc gamma RII, and Fc gamma RIII. In contrast, 6-h treatment of eosinophils or neutrophils with IFN-gamma induced neither Fc gamma RI expression on either cell type nor killing of HC or CE through Fc gamma R. In summary, incubation with GM-CSF, induced eosinophils and neutrophils to kill anti-Fc gamma RII-bearing HC and to lyse CE through Fc gamma RII. This augmented killing was not associated with enhanced expression of Fc gamma RII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The chemotactic factors could be purified to apparent homogeneity by HPLC techniques and were identified as 7.5-kDa and 15-kDa polypeptides by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. Both factors are potent chemotaxins for human neutrophils demonstrating half-maximal chemotaxis at 2 ng/ml and g ng/ml, respectively. In addition both peptides elicited release of azurophilic granule constituents when neutrophils were pretreated with cytochalasin B. Cross-desensitization experiments by using human neutrophils revealed cross-reactivities between both chemotaxins, not, however, with C5a or FMLP, indicating that both endothelial cell-derived neutrophil activating peptides (ENAP) are homologous. In addition, the 7.5-kDa factor (beta-ENAP) proved to be the quantitatively dominating and more potent chemotaxin as compared to the 15 kDa factor (alpha-ENAP). beta-ENAP shows biochemical and biologic similarities to monocyte- and lymphocyte-derived neutrophil-activating peptides MONAP and LYNAP, which recently were purified and sequenced.\r"

  ".U": "89080269\r", 
  ".W": "Lymph node T cells of MRL-lpr/lpr mice are characterized by the production of very large amounts of c-myb mRNA. To study the control of c-myb expression, a search was made for sites on the 5' c-myb gene which could bind regulatory proteins. DNase I digestion of nuclear chromatin uncovered four DNase I hypersensitive sites in the first intron of the c-myb gene, and a single site approximately 300 bp 5' to the initiation codon. Lambda exonuclease digestion of a 5'-myb fragment in the presence of nuclear extracts from either MRL-lpr/lpr PLN or EL-4 thymoma revealed stop sites approximately 300 bp 5' (-271 to -322) to the ATG initiation codon. DNase I footprint analysis demonstrated a guanine-cytosine enriched region of potential binding sites (-274 to -319) in the region of the stop sites and a fifth potential binding site closer to the initiation codon (-163 to -168). Specific gel shift bands were detected by a 5'-myb fragment (-346 to -155) with extracts from a number of different lymphoid cell lines and the appropriate specific and non-specific competitor DNA. The DNA giving rise to these gel shift bands encompassed the region defined by the stop site and footprinting studies. To determine whether or not the protein binding to the 5' c-myb gene at -274 to -319 was associated with increased c-myb mRNA, we studied nuclear extracts of several cell lines and compared the amount of binding to the amount of c-myb mRNA found on Northern analyses. Among the cell lines, there was a correlation between c-myb expression and the amount of the 5'-myb DNA binding protein. In addition, MRL-lpr/lpr lymph node cells had high c-myb expression and large amounts of the 5'-myb binding protein. This result suggests that the binding may play some role in the c-myb expression. Moreover, the most immature cell lines had the greatest amount of the binding factor, suggesting that its regulatory effect on c-myb expression might be important in early differentiation events.\r"

Increased expression (10- to 20-fold) of the H-2 Dd gene was detected at both protein and messenger RNA levels, and the time course for the accumulation of H-2 Dd protein on the cell surface parallels the increase in the steady-state messenger RNA levels. The increase in H-2 Dd expression in small B cells stimulated with LPS is detectable after 10 h of culture. The present data provide molecular and serologic evidence about alterations in the expression of the H-2 Dd Ag, previously identified as a B cell activation antigen B7.2. Our results indicate a new significance for the function and regulation of the MHC during immune responses, and suggest that the class I molecules may serve some role in the B cell activation process.\r"

Our studies indicate that Qa-2+ thymocytes are large, non-mitotic, G1 cells which have the cell surface phenotype of CD5+, CD3+, J11dLO and lack receptors for peanut agglutinin. This population can be further subdivided into three categories; CD4+/CD8-, CD4-/CD8+, and CD4-/CD8-. These data indicate that Qa-2 surface expression can only be detected on thymocytes in the final stages of differentiation. The Qa-2 Ag can be used as a cell surface marker to identify a unique subset of mature thymocytes.\r"

For this purpose, the pattern of neurofilament-positive sensory nerve fibers was studied and the lengths and substance P content of these fibers measured morphometrically in dermal and epidermal compartments of the psoriatic lesion, psoriatic but lesion-free skin, and control skin. The epidermis and dermis of the psoriatic lesions were significantly more densely innervated with neurofilament-positive fibers than either lesion-free psoriatic or control skin. Although substance P is known to be rapidly degraded in tissues, and its actual concentrations in the sections were unknown, there was an increase in substance P containing nerves in the psoriatic lesion, the increase being significant in the epidermal nerve fibers. No significant differences in the measured parameters were obtained between lesion-free psoriatic and control skin. These results indicate that there is an altered pattern of sensory nerves in a psoriatic plaque and that substance P may be an important mediator in the inflammatory processes that contribute either to the initiation or maintenance of a psoriatic lesion.\r"

  ".W": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) mediated humoral defense mechanisms have been detected on all mucous membrane surfaces. There are only a few papers about the presence of IgA in human skin. In order to demonstrate the occurrence of IgA in sebaceous and sweat glands, biopsies of normal human skin were investigated and compared to intestinal mucosa. Two different commercially available anti-IgA antibodies were used. For light microscopy peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (PAP) or avidin-biotin complex (ABC) staining was used, and for electron microscopy protein-A-gold (PAG) labeling was performed on tissue sections. Specifically decorated IgA was found in sebaceous glands as well as in various portions of eccrine glands. In sebaceous glands, the maximum of IgA concentration was seen near the mouth of pilosebaceous ducts. Sweat ducts exhibited a continuous coat of IgA, whereas secretory portions contained only singular scattered IgA positive cells. Immunoelectron microscopy suggests endocytotic uptake and processing of IgA in the glandular cells. These results indicate strongly that IgA are secreted by normal human sebaceous and sweat glands. Because it is well known that IgA plays an important role in inactivation of invading viruses, bacteria, and other antigenic structures on mucous membranes, it appears that IgA in sebum and sweat fulfil a similar function on the outer body surface.\r"

  ".W": "In evaluating patients we have noted disparity between the locations of bound immunoreactants and the level of blistering in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA). We examined 10 consecutive EBA patients by routine histology, direct (DIF) and indirect (IIF; intact and NaCl-split skin) immunofluorescence, immunofluorescence mapping (IM), and/or direct immunoelectron microscopy (DIEM). DIF was positive in each. IIF was positive in 3/8 and 6/7 patients when intact and split skin were used as substrates. DIEM revealed immunoreactants within the lamina densa (LD) in 6/10, sub-LD in 1/10, and both LD and sub-LD in 3/10 patients. In contrast, by DIEM and IM, blister formation was noted within the lamina lucida (LL) in 7/9 and 8/10, sub-LD in 1/9 and 1/10, and within both LL and sub-LD in 1/9 and 1/10, respectively. In the presence of neutrophils within the upper dermis (n = 6), cleavage occurred within the LL in 5 specimens; in one additional specimen containing predominantly neutrophils, cleavage occurred within both LL and sub-LD. In the presence of mononuclear cells (n = 2), intra-LL cleavage occurred. In the presence of eosinophils, cleavage occurred within both LL and sub-LD. In the one specimen lacking any infiltrate, the cleavage plane was exclusively sub-LD. Intra-LL cleavage planes are more common than sub-LD ones in at least early cases of EBA. These findings likely represent the intra-LL-separating effect of leukocyte-derived proteolytic enzymes, when such cells are chemoattracted to the dermoepidermal junction by bound immuno-reactants.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have demonstrated that bullous pemphigoid (BP) antigen, in extracts of cultured human keratinocytes and normal human epidermis, is a 230-kD polypeptide. However, other recent studies have suggested that there is heterogeneity of BP antigen at the molecular level. To demonstrate that this 230-kD polypeptide is the major BP antigen and to further characterize it, we tested multiple BP sera by both immunoprecipitation of extracts of radiolabeled cultured human keratinocytes and immunoblotting of extracts of normal human epidermis. Thirty-six of 37 BP sera immunoprecipitated the 230-kD polypeptide, and 11 of 13 BP sera identified the 230-kD polypeptide by immunoblotting. Eighty-six disease and normal control sera did not bind the 230-kD BP antigen. Immunoprecipitation was a more sensitive assay than was immunoblotting to detect the 230-kD antigen; BP sera that were weak or negative by immunoblotting were strongly positive by immunoprecipitation. To demonstrate that this 230-kD polypeptide shared epitopes, defined by BP sera, with the epidermal basement membrane zone, we showed that BP IgG affinity purified on this polypeptide bound the epidermal basement membrane zone by immunofluorescence. To further characterize the BP antigen and to compare the antigen synthesized by cultured human keratinocytes to the antigen extracted from epidermis, we analyzed the 230-kD BP antigen by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. BP antigen immunoprecipitated from culture extracts or BP antigen identified by immunoblots of epidermal extracts was a single spot on two-dimensional gels, with a pI of about 8. These data indicate that, although other polypeptides are sometimes identified (e.g., a 166 kD band by immunoprecipitation or a 180 kD band on immunoblots), the major BP antigen identified in cultured human keratinocytes is similar to the antigen found in normal human epidermis and is a basic 230-kD polypeptide.\r"

  ".U": "89080314\r", 
  ".W": "Homogeneous linear IgA deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) shown by direct immunofluorescence are characteristic of what is termed linear IgA bullous dermatosis. However, it is not yet certain that this disease constitutes an entity distinct from other subepidermal blistering diseases, especially when IgG deposits are also present. Sixty-one cases of subepidermal blistering disease in adults were therefore investigated by immunoelectron microscopy (IEM), and the 16 patients observed to have homogeneous linear IgA deposits were compared with the 45 who had no IgA but had IgG and/or C3. In 11 of the 16 patients with IgA (four of whom also had IgG), the deposits were linear and formed a mirror image pattern on each side of the lamina densa from which they were separated by a clear space. In contrast to this monomorphic IEM pattern, clinical and other laboratory findings were very heterogeneous, making exact clinical diagnosis difficult. Of the remaining five patients in this group of sixteen, three (all with both IgA and IgG) had bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and cicatricial pemphigoid, respectively, on IEM and clinical investigation. In the remaining two patients (one with both IgA and IgG, and one with IgA only) the deposits were located in the lamina lucida, making precise classification impossible. None of the 45 patients with isolated IgG and/or C3 deposition displayed the mirror image pattern. We conclude that this IEM pattern may constitute a specific diagnostic criterion of linear IgA dermatosis.\r"

  ".W": "This paper details current and historic epidemiologic features of Fogo Selvagem (Endemic pemphigus foliaceus) in Brazil. The following features are described. a) The disease occurs in endemic fashion in regions of Brazil within the states of Goias, Mato Grosso do Sul, Parana, Sao Paulo, and Minas Gerais. It appears that the disease is spreading toward the northwest and west, involving the states of Mato Grosso, Para, Maranhao, Rondonia, Acre, and Amazonas. b) People at risk are young peasants or children of either sex or any race exposed to the local ecology in rural areas of endemic states. Although the disease has been described in urban centers, these occurrences are rare. c) Fogo Selvagem commonly appears in wild areas being colonized and disappears as these areas become urbanized. d) The majority of patients live in close proximity to rivers and within the 10-15 Km flying range of mosquitos or black flies (such as Simulium). It is hypothesized that a black fly, Simulium pruinosum may be the vector that precipitates the disease. f) There is a significant number of Fogo Selvagem in family units where multiple, genetically related individuals are affected. g) Finally, autoantibodies against lupus-associated antigens are not present in the sera of patients with Fogo Selvagem. Clinical examination of the skin, and serologic screening for pemphigus autoantibodies are specific parameters that can be used in the search for the etiologic agents that lead to autoimmune disease of the skin. To identify and prove an etiologic agent for this well-characterized autoimmune disease would be of tremendous importance to the understanding of autoimmune skin diseases, and potentially other organ-specific autoimmune disorders.\r"

This treatment results in the formation of specific 8-MOP adducts with cellular DNA. We have previously developed monoclonal antibodies which recognize these 8-MOP photoadducts. We now report the use of these antibodies in an indirect immunofluorescence technique to study human skin biopsies. Nuclei in 3 of 5 skin biopsies from psoriasis patients undergoing PUVA therapy were positive for adducts. The presence of adducts by immunofluorescence did not correlate with plasma levels of 8-MOP. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, used to determine whether 8-MOP photoadducts could be detected in DNA isolated from the lymphocytes of psoriasis patients after PUVA therapy, were negative.\r"

Light and electron microscopy revealed that the dermo-epidermal separation occurred at the basement membrane between the sites of bullous pemphigoid antigen and laminin and that the hemidesmosomes were selectively disrupted. The cohesion and morphology of the separated epidermis as well as the immunologic parameters investigated were not altered by this procedure. The clear cut dermo-epidermal separation produced by thermolysin treatment differed from the separation obtained with trypsin, which predominantly occurred between basal and suprabasal cells by disruption of desmosomes.\r"

Recently, we reported that adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase)-positive LC density in the hind-limb skin of male mice was lower than that of female and that orchiectomy resulted in an increase in LC density, though ovariectomy had no significant effect. To further investigate the control mechanisms of sex differences in LC density, the effect of systemic and topical application of testosterone propionate (TP) on LC density was examined in C57BL/6 mice. Subcutaneous injections of TP 5.8 X 10(-8) mol (20 micrograms)/day/mouse for 14 d resulted in a significant decrease in LC density both in orchiectomized males and normal females, and such an effect was also observed in adrenalectomized mice, suggesting that this effect of TP is not indirectly mediated by glucocorticosteroids. TP was also effective when applied as an ointment (1% or 5%) to the right hind-limb skin of both orchiectomized males and normal females for 14 d; namely, the LC density of the right hind-limb was lower than that of the left. Beta-estradiol and progesterone 5.8 X 10(-8) mol/day/mouse had no significant effect on LC density when systemically applied for 14 d to normal males and females. These results suggest that sex differences in LC density may result from higher concentrations of testosterone or its metabolites in males, and that the function of testosterone may be local.\r"

Results were expressed as the concentration of inhibitor required to cause 50% inhibition of binding (I50). I50 values of antibody to J5 LPS for J5 LPS ranged from 5 x 10(-7) M to 8 x 10(-9) M. I50 values for Salmonella minnesota (Rc) were higher (2 x 10(-4) M to 2 x 10(-7) M). Other rough LPS failed to inhibit to 50% (up to 2 x 10(-4) M). J5 lipid A and core oligosaccharide inhibited, with I50 values ranging from 2 x 10(-5) M to 3 x 10(-8) M. Fifty percent inhibition was not achieved by smooth LPS (8 x 10(-5) M), heterologous lipid A (3 x 10(-4) M), or core LPS constituents (5 x 10(-3) M).

Two antibodies to human P. carinii reacted by immunofluorescence with only one human P. carinii isolate. Immunoblot studies identified major antigens of rat P. carinii with molecular masses of 40,000-100,000 daltons and of human P. carinii with molecular masses of 22,000-95,000 daltons. These studies document the existence of antigenic differences between rat and human P. carinii and are consistent with the suggestion that individual isolates of human P. carinii are also antigenically different. Further studies with these antibodies should increase understanding of the antigenic nature of P. carinii and of the interaction of P. carinii with its host.\r"

We used a screening enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) derived from reagents prepared against the Sapporo strain of HCV and confirmed positive results with a blocking ELISA and immunosorbent electron microscopy. HCV was detected in 11 (2.9%) of 375 diarrheal stools and in none of 86 stools from asymptomatic contacts. This incidence rate was half that noted for rotaviruses and higher than that noted for Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella in the original study. HCV was found in stool specimens from children in nine day care centers; HCV-associated diarrhea was sporadic, occurred with greater frequency in young children, and had a summer-fall predominance. Our results indicate that HCV is an important cause of diarrhea in day care centers and that frozen stool samples can yield epidemiological data on HCV infection.\r"

  ".U": "89080443\r", 
  ".W": "A placebo-controlled, double-blind study indicated that theophylline administration to apparently healthy, young men induced significantly depressed plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels. Plasma pyridoxal levels were not affected by theophylline therapy. The effect of theophylline on circulating pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels is explained by the observation that theophylline acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor for erythrocyte pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35) with an apparent inhibition constant (Ki) of 1.28 x 10(-5) mol/L. Theophylline did not affect erythrocyte pyridoxamine (pyridoxine)-5'-phosphate oxidase (EC 1.4.3.5) activity. During theophylline therapy, erythrocyte pyridoxal kinase levels increased nearly twofold from an initial mean level of 24.2 +/- 4.0 (+/- SD) nmol to 46.9 +/- 7.3 nmol pyridoxal-5'-phosphate per gram of hemoglobin per hour. This partially counteracted the effect of theophylline on vitamin B6 metabolism. Nevertheless, erythrocyte pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels in subjects given theophylline decreased significantly (p = 0.03) from pretreatment levels. The oral tryptophan load test resulted in significantly (p = 0.007) increased urinary xanthurenic acid excretion after 4 weeks of theophylline therapy. Both plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate levels and the tryptophan load test results normalized after 1 week of pyridoxine supplementation, indicating that 10 mg pyridoxine per day was effective to counteract the antagonistic effect of short-term theophylline therapy on vitamin B6 metabolism.\r"

Forty-eight empirical studies are summarized, discussed, and contrasted with reviews and methodological criticisms of past investigations. Strong support is found for an association between hypertension and such psychosocial factors as the identification and expression of anger, the use of inhibiting defense mechanisms (i.e., denial and repression), and interpersonal anxiety. Even when criticisms of the older literature are taken into account, the current finding show surprising continuity with past theoretical statements about the hypertensive personality.\r"

Formal neuropsychological evaluation provides greater sensitivity and detects a wider range of cognitive deficits but is too lengthy for efficient use at the bedside or in epidemiological studies. The authors developed the High Sensitivity Cognitive Screen (HSCS), a 20-minute interview-based test, to identify patients who show disorder on formal neuropsychological evaluation. An initial study demonstrated satisfactory test-retest and interrater reliability. The HSCS was then administered to 60 psychiatric and neurological patients with suspected cognitive deficits but without gross impairment, who also completed formal neuropsychological testing. Results of both tests were independently classified as either normal, borderline, or abnormal. The HSCS correctly classified 93% of patients across the normal-abnormal dichotomy and showed promise for characterizing the extent and severity of cognitive dysfunction.\r"

Ninety-one patients who were receiving cisplatin (120 mg/m2) as initial chemotherapy were entered into this double-blind trial. All patients received intravenous (IV) metoclopramide, dexamethasone, and lorazepam for the control of acute emesis during the period from 0 to 24 hours after cisplatin. Patients were then randomized to one of three treatment regimens: placebo; oral dexamethasone, 8 mg twice daily for two days, then 4 mg twice daily for two days; or the combination of oral metoclopramide, 0.5 mg/kg four times daily for four days, plus oral dexamethasone administered as above. Forty-eight percent of individuals who received the two-drug combination of metoclopramide plus dexamethasone experienced delayed vomiting as opposed to 65% who were administered dexamethasone alone and 89% who received placebo (P = .006). Scores assessing the severity of delayed nausea and vomiting were consistently worse in individuals receiving placebo. The incidences of sleepiness, restlessness, heartburn, hiccoughs, loose bowel movements, insomnia, and acute dystonic reactions did not differ significantly among the three regimens and were mild and self-limited. The two-drug combination of oral metoclopramide plus dexamethasone is well tolerated, safe, and more effective than dexamethasone alone or placebo in controlling delayed vomiting following cisplatin.\r"

  ".W": "From September 1984 through March 1987, 30 patients with locally recurrent breast carcinoma who had been heavily pretreated with conventional modes of therapy (radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy) were entered into a phase II study of hyperthermia and low-dose irradiation. The purpose of the study was to determine the feasibility, effectiveness, and morbidity of this treatment combination. Radiation therapy was administered twice weekly, 4 Gy per fraction, to a total dose of 32 Gy, with 6 or 9 MeV electrons depending on the thickness of the lesions. Hyperthermia generated by microwave frequencies of 200 to 700 MHz was administered immediately after radiation therapy, with a time and temperature aim of 60 minutes at 43 degrees C. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 17 patients (57%), and partial response (PR) in 11 patients (36%). Response was positively correlated with tumor size; lesions less than 5 cm in diameter achieved CR significantly more frequently than lesions greater than or equal to 5 cm (P less than .001). Eighty percent of the complete responders continued to experience sustained control of the treated site from 6 to 32 months but showed evidence of progressive systemic disease or locoregional progression to the adjacent untreated sites, reflecting the natural history of this disease and extensive dermal lymphatic permeation. True recurrence within the treated volume occurred in three patients. Nonhealing ulceration developed in nine patients and seven of those were associated with persistent tumor. This study confirms the palliative value of hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy for previously irradiated recurrent chest wall tumors and sets the scene for its comparative clinical evaluation against radiation therapy alone as first line therapy for locally recurrent breast carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "The use of adjuvant chemotherapy for postmenopausal patients with early breast cancer remains controversial because the potential benefits in terms of prolongation of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) must be balanced against the toxicity of treatment. Following mastectomy, 463 evaluable postmenopausal women with node-positive breast cancer were randomized to receive either chemoendocrine therapy for 1 year, or endocrine therapy alone for 1 year, or no adjuvant therapy (Ludwig Trial III). At 7-years median follow-up, OS was longer for the chemoendocrine-treated patients compared with controls (P = .04) and compared with the adjuvant endocrine therapy-alone group (P = .08). In order to balance this therapeutic advantage against the toxic effects of treatment, OS time was divided into time with toxicity (TOX), time without symptoms and toxicity (TWiST), and time after systemic relapse (REL). TOX and REL were weighted by coefficients of utility relative to TWiST and the results added to give a period of quality-adjusted survival (Q-TWiST). Benefits measured by Q-TWiST generally favored chemoendocrine therapy. For example, if TOX and REL were both given utility coefficients of 0.5 relative to 1.0 for TWiST, then by 7 years the average Q-TWiST for chemoendocrine therapy was 6.7 months longer than for no-adjuvant therapy (P = .05) and 4.1 months longer than for endocrine therapy alone (P = .20). Quality-adjusted survival analysis is recommended in assessing costs and benefits of toxic adjuvant therapy. In this example, it supports the use of chemoendocrine therapy in postmenopausal node-positive patients for a wide range of relative values assigned to periods with symptoms and toxicity.\r"

In order to reduce the incidence of severe complications noted with HDARA-C-containing regimens, we used a combination of intravenous (IV) idarubicin (IDARUB) at optimal dosage and cytarabine (ARA-C) at intermediate dosage. Thirty-five patients aged 23 to 78 years (median, 56) with AML in first relapse received IDARUB, 8 mg/m2/d for five days, and ARA-C, 1 g/m2 every 12 hours for six doses. Of the 35 patients, 21 achieved a complete remission (CR), four had a partial remission (PR), four died in aplasia, and six were nonresponders. The only factor influencing the CR rate was the duration of the first CR (35% for patients relapsing before 16 months v 83% for patients relapsing after 16 months, P = .003). Mucositis was the most significant extrahematologic side effect. Diarrhea, skin toxicity, and hepatic disturbances were rare and mild. There was no cerebellar toxicity, even in 25 patients greater than 50 years of age. This regimen is effective and well tolerated even in elderly patients, and could be used either as induction or consolidation therapy for the treatment of AML.\r"

  ".W": "Of 455 acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANL) patients who underwent marrow transplantation, 95 (21%) relapsed a median of 6.5 months posttransplantation and 62 received further treatment. Twenty achieved remission. Success of therapy was related to the length of time from marrow transplant to relapse and to the use of cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunomycin. Aggressive chemotherapy for patients relapsing within 100 days of marrow transplant was associated with a high incidence of early death (six of 14 patients) and a low probability of remission (one of 14). Of 23 patients who relapsed in excess of 1 year from marrow transplant, 15 achieved a complete remission. The median disease-free survival is 6 months (range, 0.4 to 53+ months). Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) recurred in 130 of 366 patients (36%), and 94 received further therapy. Fifty-two achieved a remission. Remissions were more common in late relapse patients (greater than 1 year from transplantation): 65% v 7% for those relapsing within 100 days from transplant (P less than .05). Testicular relapse occurred in 11 patients and was the sole site of relapse in seven. Three are alive and free of disease 58 to 109+ months after relapse. The median survival for the treated patients is 10.5 months (range, 5 to 109+ months). We propose that reinduction be attempted in all patients relapsing greater than 1 year from marrow transplantation. Ara-C and daunomycin should be employed in the treatment of ANL. The decision for treatment of patients relapsing earlier than 1 year should be made on an individual basis.\r"

Consolidation therapy was not administered. The study population included a large number of older (greater than 50 years) patients. Seventy-five percent of patients achieved complete remission. With a median follow-up of 6 years, the median duration of complete remission is greater than 4 years, with 53% of patients expected to remain in remission at both 3 and 5 years. Overall, median survival duration is 27.9 months, with 45% and 35% of all patients expected to survive 3 and 5 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified patients with T-cell disease and mediastinal masses (P less than .001) and those with low values of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = .057) as being at greatest risk of relapse. Therapy was well tolerated by patients under age 35, but older patients suffered appreciable mortality. We conclude that this treatment program is effective therapy for adult ALL, yielding a large proportion of durable remissions despite the exclusion of consolidation therapy.\r"

Forty-four consecutive de novo (DN) patients (including ten stage II, 18 stage III, and 16 stage IV), as well as 16 previously treated (PT) patients, were accrued. Twenty of the 44 DN patients were symptomatic at presentation. Complete clinical responses were obtained in 20 of the 27 DN patients with favorable histologies (FH), and six of the 17 with unfavorable histologies (UH). Partial responses were obtained in six patients with FH and 11 patients with UH; only one patient showed no response to TBI. By univariate analysis, PT patients showed a trend for decreased relapse-free survival (P = .066) and decreased survival (P = .093). Multivariate analysis identified the best predictors of response rate to be histology (P = .0146) and marrow involvement (P = .0854); of relapse-free survival, histology (P = .0035), and TBI dose (P = .002); and of absolute survival, age (P = .0012), histology (P = .012), and TBI dose (P = .029). Thirty of the 41 patients who relapsed underwent salvage treatment with either chemotherapy or radiation. Twenty-three of the 30 undergoing salvage therapy obtained a second complete clinical response. There were no treatment-related deaths. The most common complication was thrombocytopenia. The major late complications were myeloproliferative disorders in four patients, which occurred only after cumulative TBI doses in excess of 200 cGy.\r"

  ".W": "Successful treatment of localized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in childhood with 18 months of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, methotrexate (MTX), and prednisone (COMP) prompted a randomized clinical trial to determine whether a 6-month course of the same therapy was as effective as an 18-month course when combined with local irradiation. Two successive Childrens Cancer Study Group (CCSG) protocols (CCG 551 and CCG 501) entered 232 eligible patients from October 1979 until April 1986. Initially, all children with localized disease were considered eligible, but by a subsequent amendment, those with lymphoblastic (LB) histology were excluded. Hence, the study population consisted of 211 patients with nonlymphoblastic (NLB) and 21 with LB disease. Early relapses (before 6 months) occurred in 13 patients with NLB histology. Late relapses were seen in seven patients, three with LB histology. Among the 104 randomized patients who followed the prescribed therapy, there were four recurrences and no differences between 6-month and 18-month therapy. The overall survival for NLB disease was 91% on CCG 551 and 98% on CCG 501. We conclude that 6 months of COMP is excellent therapy for children with localized NLB NHL.\r"

The anatomy of the intracranial vessels is considered, as well as known facts concerning trigeminal neuralgia, hemifacial spasm, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia relating to MVC. The results of microvascular decompression (MVD) are analyzed; one-third of patients do not obtain an optimum result. The evidence used to support the hypothesis of MVC, including neurophysiology, is discussed and it is believed to be insufficient and unconvincing. The basis of MVC could be trauma of the nerve during operative dissection and \"decompression.\" The concept of MVC might be more convincing if MVD can be shown to cure a condition such as spasmodic torticollis, which cannot be remedied by damage to or section of the same cranial nerve or nerves.\r"

The results were evaluated with the aid of a specially developed weighted neuropsychological test battery providing single-value estimation of \"life quality\" of patients, as well as with a clinical performance scale. Based on these methods, it was established that patients improved within 6 months following therapy. This improvement was maintained in surviving patients during the 2-year follow-up period. The patients led a relatively normal life, but when their condition deteriorated their decline was rapid. The median survival time of patients treated with radiotherapy did not differ significantly from that of patients receiving chemotherapy in addition. Nor did the analysis of life quality and of changes in clinical performance show any benefit in supplementing surgery and radiation therapy with CCNU chemotherapy at the dosage used.\r"

Two strains of rat brain tumor were used: strain A and B, both induced by the Rous sarcoma virus. Strain A was biologically more malignant than strain B. The blood flow was unevenly distributed in the tumor, compared with the contralateral cortex, the average blood flow in the tumor was about 50% in strain A and 60% in strain B. The distribution of blood flow did not correlate with the distribution of S-phase cells or with the distribution of vessels in the tumor in either strain A or B. The average glucose utilization in strain A was about 250% and in strain B about 170% of that of the contralateral cortex. The high glucose utilization area correlated well with the distribution of BUdR-positive nuclei in strain B. These findings suggest that the biological malignancy of a tumor correlates with glucose utilization rather than with blood flow, and that malignant brain tumors show a marked increase in glucose utilization for nucleic acid synthesis.\r"

The endocervical isolation rates for Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae were 44.7% and 36.4%, respectively. In comparison with adolescents with chlamydia-associated PID, those with gonococcus-associated PID had a shorter duration of pain before admission (p less than 0.05), higher mean maximum temperatures (p less than 0.01), and higher leukocyte counts (p less than 0.01). Pelvic ultrasound studies showed adnexal enlargement or tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) in 85.2% of the patients. Of the 88 adolescents in whom adequate sonograms were obtained, 17 (19.3%) had TOA. In 12 of the 17 adolescents, the abscesses were identified sonographically before being diagnosed clinically. With clinical criteria alone, only the leukocyte count and prior history of PID differed significantly between those with TOA and those with uncomplicated PID. These findings support a more liberal use of pelvic ultrasound studies in teenagers with PID. Our high detection rate of C. trachomatis and the difficulty in predicting the cause of the infection in an individual patient support treating all adolescents with PID with agents effective against both C. trachomatis and N. gonorrhoeae.\r"

Usually, studies with positive results are more likely to be published than studies with negative results, which leads to a preponderance of false-positive results in the literature. Empiric studies have demonstrated that the induced bias is large and can have a serious impact on meta-analyses, in which data from several studies are aggregated, as well as on informal reviews. The problem is deeply embedded in current research practice, which encourages demonstration of statistical significance to \"prove\" theories, and one of its causes is the pressure to publish extensively that is an integral part of the competition for academic promotion. Serious efforts to reduce this problem will involve restructuring the process by which study results are disseminated, changing editorial policies, and altering the style and methods of statistical analysis.\r"

Lung volumes, expiratory flows and nonspecific bronchial responsiveness to methacholine using doses up to 64 g/L were measured before and four and eight weeks after captopril treatment was started. Throughout the study the subjects recorded respiratory symptoms and peak expiratory flow rates. In four subjects a persistent cough developed related to the use of captopril, but this was not associated with the development of airflow obstruction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The mean provocative concentration of methacholine that resulted in a 20% fall in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s was 43.6 +/- 1.8 g/L after eight weeks of captopril treatment compared with 61.6 +/- 1.2 g/L at the baseline evaluation. We concluded that there was no significant change in lung function during treatment with captopril. The development of a cough related to this medication is not associated with the development of airflow obstruction or airway hyperresponsiveness.\r"

However, new techniques now allow imaging comparable in quality to computed tomography (CT). Magnetic resonance imaging offers the advantages of greater tissue contrast, multiplanar imaging, and lack of ionizing radiation or risk of toxic reactions from iodinated contrast media. Its use remains limited by high cost, limited availability, lack of a bowel contrast agent, and long imaging time, which some patients cannot tolerate. In many areas of abdominal imaging, MRI is now comparable to CT, but because of the greater availability and lesser cost, CT remains the procedure of choice. Magnetic resonance imaging is more accurate for staging neoplasms of the liver, adrenal glands, kidneys, bladder, prostate, uterus, and cervix and may aid in diagnosis of hepatic, adrenal, and uterine masses. In selected patients, especially those in whom CT is inconclusive or those who cannot tolerate iodinated contrast material, MRI can provide valuable information. Development of faster scanning techniques and MRI contrast agents and wider availability will probably increase the usefulness of abdominal MRI. At this time, MRI complements other abdominal imaging procedures. In a small number of patients, however, it can provide unique information in a virtually risk-free manner.\r"

Physicians in all specialties may detect sexual exploitation of youngsters and are mandated to report such cases. Failure to diagnose child molestation and pedophilia and to treat their cause can have serious, long-lasting consequences for innocent victims and continued distress for the perpetrator and for the professional who missed the diagnosis. A single child molester may commit hundreds of sexual acts on hundreds of children. The etiology of paraphilic syndromes is multifactorial. There are substantial differences among sexual abusers of children in their personalities and psychopathologies. Although available interventions are symptomatically palliative rather than curative, many pedophiles can benefit from appropriate treatment. Primary prevention may be the key to reducing the frequency of child sexual abuse.\r"

Primary nasal paragangliomas are generally localized, although the potential for local invasion is well documented. Malignancy or functional activity has not been described. Complete excision is curative. Jugulotympanic, vagal, and ciliary paragangliomas with extension into the nasopharynx or nasal cavity are typically more advanced at the time of diagnosis and require complete evaluation by computed tomography and arteriography to determine the tumor extent. The operative approach is dependant on the extent of tumor invasion. Irradiation and tumor embolization have been useful for unresectable or partially excised tumors.\r"

  ".W": "Intrapancreatic extension of pancreatic duct cell carcinoma in 19 resectable cases was evaluated by both hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and quick immunostaining using antibodies against cancer-associated antigens--e.g., CA19-9, DUPAN 2, and CEA--on the intraoperative frozen-section biopsy during the course of laparotomy. By H&E staining, malignant lesions were identified in four of 19 cases (21%). By the immunostaining method, however, cancer cells were detected in 10 of 19 cases (52.6%). This immunostaining method was particularly useful in defining cancer cells surrounded by dense fibrous connective tissue, in which cancer cells are usually difficult to evaluate by H&E staining. Thus, the application of such immunostaining, together with H&E staining, on the cryostat sections of biopsy specimens may provide important information for the appropriate operative method. Retrospective study of permanent sections revealed that pathological diagnosis by quick immunostaining was more accurate than diagnosis by H&E staining.\r"

In the experimentally infected volunteers, the QBC tube test and the thick blood smear were comparable and the QBC tube could detect as few as 4 parasites/microliter blood. When used for mass screening in the field study, the test had a sensitivity of 70% for the diagnosis of malaria compared with 92% for a single thick blood smear. However, when used to diagnose malaria in hospital patients, the test detected as few as 3 parasites/microliter in 91 of 92 patients with asexual parasitaemia. For the three studies, the QBC tube was highly specific (98.4%), indicating malaria in only 8 of 487 subjects with negative blood films. The species of parasite was correctly identified in 77% of species. Processing the QBC tube was easier and much more rapid than was processing a thick blood smear, taking only 5 min for centrifugation and 5 min for examination. The QBC tube is not a substitute for the blood smear, but its speed and ease of use make it an important new tool for the diagnosis of malaria.\r"

A series of 120 acoustic neuromas resected at the University of Michigan was reviewed and revealed two such patients. These two patients presented with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss and unilateral tinnitus and were found to have completely normal auditory brainstem response. The diagnosis of acoustic neuroma would have been delayed if a comprehensive evaluation had not been pursued.\r"

This report demonstrates that the in vivo murine subrenal capsule assay was an efficient, sensitive method for retrospectively predicting the clinical response of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck to chemotherapy. Twenty-five courses of chemotherapy in 22 patients were compared to responses in the in vivo assay. The assay correctly identified sensitivity to chemotherapy in 86% of clinically responding patients. The specificity of the assay was 78%. A 60% efficiency for predicting clinical response and a 93% efficiency for predicting clinical resistance were demonstrated. Eighty percent of the results were correctly classified. The murine subrenal capsule assay has potential in planning of chemotherapy for selected patients.\r"

HPV-11 DNA signals and/or papillomavirus genus-specific common antigen were detected in all eight samples of multiple laryngeal papilloma. On the other hand, in 12 samples of single laryngeal papilloma, neither papillomavirus genus-specific common antigen nor HPV-11 DNA were detected. Four patients were positive for both HPV-11 DNA and pgs-antigen. In three of these four patients, HPV-11 mRNA signals were also detected.

Through a simple screening protocol, we diagnosed vHL retrospectively in 15 cases, and for the first time in 28, 11 of whom were presymptomatic. We found many complications of vHL in previously diagnosed relatives and in new cases. This study has demonstrated the utility and benefit of preventive surveillance in those known to have vHL, and of presymptomatic screening for affected relatives in families with vHL. The features of vHL were reviewed in our 43 cases and 511 cases from the medical literature. The patterns, frequencies, and ages of onset for each lesion were compared. Renal malignancies caused almost as much mortality in vHL as CNS malignancies. This family was exceptional for absence of pheochromocytoma and erythrocythemia, for more renal and pancreatic cysts and malignancies, and for slightly fewer eye or CNS lesions. Bilateral renal adenocarcinomata were found presymptomatically in five young subjects, who had bilateral nephrectomy and hemodialysis. Three survived long-term after renal transplants. Five relatives had pancreatic malignancies, which are definite although uncommon manifestations of vHL. Recommendations are made for family screening, which was economical and effective. Bayesian calculations help to predict risks for genetic counseling. The molecular basis of vHL may soon be found, since it has been linked to DNA markers on the short arm of chromosome 3.\r"

A total of 162 cases of C. septicum infection have been reported. Eighty-one percent of these patients had an associated malignancy. Thirty-four percent of all patients had associated colon carcinoma, while 40% had a hematologic malignancy. Thirty-seven percent of reported patients had an occult malignancy at the time of their infection with C. septicum. In many patients, the portal of entry was found in the large intestine. In a particularly lethal form (79% mortality) of C. septicum infection, known as \"distant myonecrosis,\" infection metastatic from the initial site of infection causes severe myonecrosis, gangrene, and often death within hours of clinical detection. Overall, survival of patients with C. septicum infection is only 35%. Review of all cases of C. septicum infection suggests several conclusions. 1) Patients with malignancy, particularly colonic or hematologic, and patients with cyclic neutropenia who develop signs and symptoms of sepsis, especially with associated findings of abdominal pain or pain in an extremity, should be treated for possible clostridial infection. 2) C. septicum infection does not appear to be a result of a single specific defect in either humoral or cell-mediated immunity. Rather, it may occur in patients who are granulocytopenic and therefore prone to an enterocolitis. 3) Patients in whom an infection with C. septicum is found must undergo a vigorous search for malignancy following acute therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common diagnosis in our patients. The presence of high-titer antibodies against the nuclear ribonucleoprotein fraction of extractable nuclear antigen (nRNP) did not allow the identification of a particular subgroup. However, patients with this antibody tended to fulfill more criteria of more diseases than those without it. The findings lead us to conclude that antibodies to nRNP do not identify a particular subgroup within the overlap syndromes and that mixed connective tissue disease does not appear to be a distinct entity.\r"

We spend more than 11 percent of the gross national product on health care, yet roughly 35 million Americans have no financial protection from medical expenses. To an increasing degree, the present financing system is inflationary, unfair, and wasteful. In its place we need a strategy that addresses the whole system, offers financial protection from health care expenses to all, and promotes the development of economical financing and delivery arrangements. Such a strategy must be designed to be broadly acceptable in our society. To remedy the deprivation, we propose that everyone not covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or some other public program be enabled to buy affordable coverage, either through their employers or through a \"public sponsor.\" To attack the excess, we propose a strategy of managed competition in which collective agents, called sponsors, such as the Health Care Financing Administration and large employers, contract with competing health plans and manage a process of informed cost-conscious consumer choice that rewards providers who deliver high-quality care economically.\r"

We have previously reported that after a mean of 31 months, treated patients did better. We now report the results of a longer follow-up. Eighty-one patients with proteinuria (greater than or equal to 3.5 g per day) and biopsy-proved membranous nephropathy were randomly assigned to receive either supportive therapy alone or a six-month course of corticosteroids alternated with chlorambucil (0.2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day) every other month. Methylprednisolone was first given intravenously in three pulses (1 g per day) and was then given orally (0.4 mg per kilogram per day) for 27 days. The patients were followed for 2 to 11 years (median, 5). Two patients in the control group and one in the treatment group died. At the last follow-up visit, 9 of 39 patients assigned to the control group (23 percent) and 28 of 42 patients assigned to the treatment group (67 percent) did not have the nephrotic syndrome. At five years there were more remissions of the nephrotic syndrome in treated patients than in controls (22 of 30 vs. 10 of 25; P = 0.026). Compared with base-line values, the mean reciprocal of the plasma creatinine level declined significantly in the control group (33 percent; P = 0.0002) but not in the treatment group (6 percent; P not significant). Plasma creatinine increased by 50 percent or more in 19 controls (49 percent) and in 4 treated patients (10 percent). We conclude that a six-month course of methylprednisolone and chlorambucil can bring about sustained remission of the nephrotic syndrome and help to preserve renal function in patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy.\r"

  ".U": "89082663\r", 
  ".W": "One of the most commonly found transforming ras oncogenes in human tumours has a valine codon replacing the glycine codon at position 12 of the normal c-Ha-ras gene. To understand the structural reasons behind cell transformation arising from this single amino acid substitution, we have determined the crystal structure of the GDP-bound form of the mutant protein, p21(Val-12), encoded by this oncogene. We report here the overall structure of p21(Val-12) at 2.2 A resolution and compare it with the structure of the normal c-Ha-ras protein. One of the major differences is that the loop of the transforming ras protein that binds the beta-phosphate of the guanine nucleotide is enlarged. Such a change in the 'catalytic site' conformation could explain the reduced GTPase activity of the mutant, which keeps the protein in the GTP bound 'signal on' state for a prolonged period time, ultimately causing cell transformation.\r"

Clinical diagnosis of progressive aphasia is difficult early in its course, and the differential diagnosis is usually said to include Alzheimer's and Pick's diseases. We report a 61-year-old man with autopsy-proven Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) whose major initial manifestation was a progressive, fluent aphasia. Myoclonus was absent, and characteristic EEG abnormalities appeared relatively late. We believe that this case of CJD is unique in its presentation of profound and isolated aphasia. CJD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of the progressive aphasia syndrome.\r"

No strokes occurred in the first group during follow-up, and the annual stroke rate in the second group was 3.8% for the territory of the occluded artery and 5.7% for all vascular territories. Death rate was 6.6% annually for both groups, mainly cardiac. Transcranial Doppler with digital compression of each carotid artery demonstrated middle cerebral artery (MCA) dependent on the patent carotid being total in 50% and partial in 30%. There was no correlation between degree of stenosis and MCA dependency (r = -0.24). Our data on stroke risk in asymptomatic patients with unilateral carotid artery occlusion indicate a benign outcome.\r"

Two neurologists independently reviewed the clinical records of each patient without knowledge of the patient's identity or clinical or pathologic diagnoses; each clinician reached a clinical diagnosis based on criteria derived from those of the NINCDS/ADRDA. In 34 (63%) cases both clinicians were correct, in nine (17%) one was correct, and in 11 (20%) neither was correct. These results show that in patients with a clinical diagnosis of dementia, the etiology cannot be accurately predicted during life.\r"

Side effects were minor and transient, although dysphagia occurred in four.

Many pediatricians, however, are uncomfortable with this term because it is a poorly defined and derogatory expression. Some would even deny that infants and children can be spoiled. Avoiding the use of the expression spoiled can create difficulties in communicating with parents concerned about their children's behavior. In this article, the spoiled child syndrome will be defined and those patterns of behavior that characterize it will be distinguished from other patterns of difficult behavior which may be confused with it. The spoiled child syndrome is characterized by excessive self-centered and immature behavior, resulting from the failure of parents to enforce consistent, age-appropriate limits. Many of the problem behaviors that cause parental concern are unrelated to spoiling as properly understood. Such behaviors are often age-related normal behaviors, reactions to family stresses, or patterns of behavior determined by factors inherent in the child. Pediatricians can provide counseling and reassurance for such behaviors and, by helping parents understand the etiology of true spoiling, can encourage the use of behavior modification techniques for its prevention and treatment.\r"
