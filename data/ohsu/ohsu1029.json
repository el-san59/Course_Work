  ".U": "91183381\r", 
  ".W": "The concept of disease is of cardinal importance in medical practice. The current definition has developed over more than 200 years. It includes a distinctive natural history and identifiable cellular changes. Pickering proposed a fundamental alteration to the definition when he suggested that essential hypertension is a quantitative disease without causative cellular change distinguishing normal from abnormal. The nature of essential hypertension has been confused from the beginning because of a category error. Injury is conceptually distinguished from disease. Essential hypertension, defined as elevated blood pressure together with its cardiovascular consequences, is found to be neither an injury nor a disease according to current definitions. Instead, essential hypertension refers to a treatment group just as \"the fevers\" did in an earlier century. One effect on patients of the failure to resolve this diagnostic paradox is the burden of suffering from the label of \"disease\" rather than from a state that may be substantially due to their own behavior. A theoretical consequence of importance for psychiatric theory is that the disease status of functional disorders can no longer be defended by an appeal to the existence of a quantitative disease of blood pressure.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate hearing loss in elderly patients. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Family practice. PATIENTS: All ambulatory patients 65 years of age or older who attended the practice from June to August 1989. OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly--Screening Version (HHIE-S) and the Welch-Allyn Audioscope. Patients who failed one or both of the screening tests were referred to a speech and hearing clinic for audiologic assessment and treatment recommendations. Those with hearing aids were excluded from the main study but were given the opportunity to have them assessed at the clinic. MAIN RESULTS: Of 157 eligible patients 42 were excluded: 16 refused to participate, 13 already had hearing aids, and 13 could not be contacted. Of the remaining 115, 34 failed one or both of the tests (14 failed the HHIE-S, 9 failed the audioscope test, and 11 failed both). Of the 34, 25 completed the audiologic assessment at the clinic. Fifteen were found to have severe hearing impairment; the recommendation was hearing aids for 12, further assessment for 2 and no treatment for 1. Of the remaining 10 patients it was thought that 6 would benefit from hearing aids. Ten of the 11 patients with hearing aids who agreed to undergo testing at the clinic were found to need an adjustment or replacement of their devices. CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss is a significant problem in elderly patients in primary practice. Further study is required to determine which of the two screening tools is most effective. Most elderly patients with hearing aids may require modification or replacement of their devices.\r"

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Southern region of the Queen Charlotte Islands, BC, served by a 21-bed hospital and medical clinic in Queen Charlotte City. The hospital and clinic are staffed by five family practitioners without local obstetric, pediatric, anesthetic or surgical support. PATIENTS: All women beyond 20 weeks' gestation who gave birth from Jan. 1, 1984, to Dec. 31, 1988; 33% were primiparous and 20% native. Of the 286 women 192 (67%) delivered locally, 33 (12%) were transferred after admission because of antepartum or intrapartum complications, and 61 (21%) delivered elsewhere by choice or on their physician's recommendation. OUTCOME MEASURES: Perinatal mortality rate and adverse perinatal outcome (death, birth weight of less than 2500 g, neonatal transfer or Apgar score of less than 7 at 5 minutes). MAIN RESULTS: There were six perinatal deaths, for a perinatal mortality rate of 20.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4 to 37.2). The hospital-based rate of adverse perinatal outcome was 6.2% (12 of 193 newborns) (95% CI 2.8% to 9.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The perinatal mortality rate is not a meaningful way to assess small populations; about 85 years of data would be required to decrease the 95% CIs from within 16 to within 4. The rate of adverse perinatal outcome in our study was consistent with the rate in other studies. Collaboration of small, rural hospitals is required to increase cohort size so that the correlation between the currently accepted standard, the perinatal mortality rate, and other outcome measures can be determined.\r"

This study examined the feasibility of metabolic imaging, using post-exercise F-18 deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) for the diagnosis of both ischemia and hibernation in 27 patients with known coronary anatomy. Normal post-exercise FDG uptake was defined in each patient by reference to normal resting perfusion and normal coronary supply. Abnormal elevation of FDG (ischemia or hibernation) was compared in 13 myocardial segments in each patient, with the results of dipyridamole stress perfusion imaging performed by rubidium-82 positron emission tomography (Rb-PET). Myocardial ischemia was diagnosed by either FDG-PET or Rb-PET in 34 segments subtended by significant local coronary stenoses. Increased FDG uptake was present in 32/34 (94%) and a reversible perfusion defect was identified by Rb-PET in 22/34 (65%, p less than .01). In 3 patients, ischemia was identified by metabolic imaging alone. In 16 patients with previous myocardial infarction, perfusion defects were present at rest in 89 regions, 30 of which (34%) demonstrated increased FDG uptake, consistent with the presence of hibernation. Increased post-exercise FDG uptake appears to be a sensitive indicator of ischemia and myocardial hibernation. This test may be useful in selecting post-infarction patients for revascularization.\r"

In order to evaluate the echo contrast produced by HFRA, an in vitro experimental model was built using a cylinder with the HFRA catheter scanned in a water bath. The cylinder was filled with blood, mineral water, and distilled water. With a 2.5-MHz transducer, echograms were recorded and analyzed by video intensitometer, and the maximum intensity IUmax and persistence time P were calculated. Rotation frequencies of 20,000-200,000 rpm with 2.0--mm burrs and times of 10 s were tested. In another model, hyperbaric conditions for the same media were produced. The influence of debris from arterioscleroic plaque and of hematocrit on echo contrast intensity were also analyzed. The effect of HFRA on hemolysis (LDH, free hemoglobin) within 10 s and temperature were also measured. The contrast effect was transient, depending on the rotation frequency. In blood, it appeared at 20,000 rpm (IUmax at 200,000 rpm: 237 IU), in mineral water at 40,000 rpm (IUmax 165 IU), and in distilled water at 80,000 rpm (IUmax 72 IU). Persistence time was measured up to about a half-minute. Echo contrast production was reduced at 0.5 bar and fully suppressed at 2.5 bar. Debris increased contrast intensity from about 219 IU to 225 IU (at 160,000 rpm). In blood IUmax decreased from 227 IU to 97 IU by lowering the hematocrit from 44.2% to 3.6%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred twenty-eight of 183 lesions (70%) had angiographic follow-up; the lesion recurrence as a stenosis or as an occlusion was 53%. Lesion distribution did not differ between angiography and clinical follow-up groups: nearly 85% were within the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. Despite data stratification, angiographic follow-up indicated that patients after successful directional atherectomy, at a mean follow-up time of 5 mos, have more than a 50% lesion recurrence rate. Although directional atherectomy (Simpson AtheroCath) utilizing present techniques has excellent primary success and acceptable complication rates, angiographic follow-up statistics are bothersome.\r"

However, little is known about the prognosis of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA)-induced coronary aneurysms. Therefore, we investigated the occurrence and the medium long-term prognosis of such aneurysms in 728 patients who, after successful PTCA, underwent repeat coronary angiography at mean 4.5 months post-PTCA. A coronary aneurysm at the site of PTCA ws noted in 3.9% of patients (n = 28). Of the potentially predictive factors analyzed, only a coronary dissection at the time of PTCA had statistically significant influence. The long-term prognosis of PTCA-induced coronary aneurysms was excellent. One patient underwent (unrelated) cardiac surgery, all other 27 patients remained eventfree. We conclude that the same benign nature of coronary aneurysmal disease holds true for those aneurysms that develop after PTCA.\r"

The purpose of this study was to define the incidence and course of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction. We reviewed the catheterization and echocardiographic data of 35 patients, ages 3 days to 18 years (mean = 7.9 years), with isolated aortic valve stenosis who underwent balloon dilation with a fall in aortic valve gradient to less than 20 mm Hg. Post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction was suspected from post-dilation left ventricular angiogram and was quantitated by echocardiographic and Doppler examinations performed immediately after dilation and in a 1-3 month follow-up period. Continuous wave Doppler directed by color flow Doppler was used for evaluation and differentiation of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction and residual aortic valve stenosis. Three children (3/35 [9%]) all under 2 years of age developed post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction immediately after dilation. The obstruction within the cavity resolved spontaneously in all three patients. Conclusions: 1) Post-dilation left ventricular mid-cavitary obstruction can occur in children under 2 years of age after balloon dilation of severe aortic valve stenosis, and 2) total regression of post-dilation mid-cavitary obstruction occurs spontaneously in all patients.\r"

The defect size (expressed as the ratio of the area of the defect to the cross-sectional area of the ascending aorta) was related to the calculated \"effective defect resistance,\" where a significant (non-linear) correlation was found. The effective resistance of the defect is a useful aid for estimation of the anatomical size of a ventricular septal defect. The close correlation between anatomical size and the hemodynamic parameter Rd/Rs allows one to calculate the ratio Rp/Rs with this concept using noninvasive Doppler-ultrasound and echocardiography. This was performed in 21 children with VSD who underwent cardiac catheterisation. The noninvasive calculated flow ratio Qp/Qs and the resistance ratio Rp/Rs showed a close correlation to the values measured at cardiac catheterisation.\r"

To determine whether this response is associated with an altered pattern of creatine kinase gene expression, we induced arterial hypertension in rats by suprarenal aortic banding. After 4 days, left ventricular myocardium from hypertensive (n = 7) and normotensive, sham-operated (n = 5) rats was analyzed for isoenzyme activities by chromatography; M and B creatine kinase subunit protein by Western blot; and M, B, and mitochondrial creatine kinase mRNA by Northern blot. Although total creatine kinase activity increased in hypertensive (1,096 +/- 214 IU/g left ventricle) compared with normotensive rats (648 +/- 81 IU/g left ventricle, p less than 0.01), the relative proportions of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoenzymes did not change. The mass of M and B subunits increased 1.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively, in hypertensive compared with control rats. Similarly, the mRNA for M and B subunits as well as mitochondrial creatine kinase increased 2.6-, 1.6-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in hypertensive rats compared with control rats. Thus, increased energy requirements in acute pressure overload are met by generalized induction of creatine kinase mRNA and subunit protein and not by an isoenzyme switch.\r"

  ".W": "Ischemic injury is characterized by neutrophil (PMN)--endothelial cell adhesion and diapedesis associated with thromboxane (TX) generation. Neutrophil-endothelial cell interaction is regulated in part by the leukocyte adhesion receptor CD 18 glycoprotein complex and the endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). This study tests the role of TX in ischemia-induced diapedesis and evaluates whether the diapedesis is regulated by neutrophil or endothelial adhesion receptors. Plasma derived from rabbit hind limbs made ischemic for 3 hours (n = 6) and reperfused for 10 minutes had increased levels of TXB2 3,450 pg/ml, which was higher than sham rabbit (n = 6) values of 653 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). When introduced into abraded skin chambers placed on the dorsum of other normal rabbits (n = 6), this ischemic plasma induced 1,000 pg/ml of new TX synthesis and diapedesis of 1,235 PMN/mm3. The total TX concentration and PMN accumulations in blister fluid were correlated (r = 0.88, p less than 0.05). In contrast, sham rabbit plasma induced no TX synthesis and diapedesis of only 77 PMN/mm3 (p less than 0.05). Administration of 50 ng/ml of authentic TXB2 into blisters induced an accumulation of 453 PMN/mm3, which was higher than that in saline controls (18 PMN/mm3) (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of normal rabbits used for the diapedesis assay (n = 4) with the TX synthetase inhibitor OKY 046 (2 mg/kg/hr) limited ischemic plasma and authentic TXB2 induced diapedesis to 142 and 76 PMN/mm3, respectively (both p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To examine this issue, the reactivity of resistance and conduit vessels was evaluated in 11 patients with peripheral atherosclerotic disease and six control subjects. Responsiveness of resistance vessels was measured by venous occlusion plethysmography. Responsiveness of conduit vessels was determined by quantitative angiography to measure the diameter of the superficial femoral artery. To distinguish endothelium-dependent vasodilation from that caused by direct smooth muscle relaxation, each participant received intra-arterial infusions of methacholine and nitroprusside, respectively. Flow-mediated dilation of the superficial femoral artery was determined during reactive hyperemia. Vasoconstrictor function was determined by the infusion of phenylephrine. Methacholine reduced calf vascular resistance in the control subjects but not in the patients with atherosclerosis (-64 +/- 11% versus 6 +/- 18%, p less than 0.01). Nitroprusside decreased calf vascular resistance comparably in each group (-51 +/- 5% versus -42 +/- 4%, p = NS). The vasoconstrictor effect of phenylephrine was similar in each group (105 +/- 30% versus 108 +/- 22%, p = NS). In the superficial femoral artery, the vasodilator responses to both methacholine (20 +/- 4% versus 1 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05) and nitroprusside (19 +/- 4% versus 5 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05) were blunted in the atherosclerotic patients as was the vasoconstrictive response to phenylephrine (-15 +/- 1% versus -1 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The objective of this study was to determine whether adenine nucleotides shorten the action potential duration and increase IKACh,Ado in guinea pig atrial myocytes by directly activating adenosine receptors. The potency and efficacy of AMP and adenosine in increasing IKACh,Ado and shortening atrial action potential duration were similar; the EC50 values for AMP and adenosine were 3.4 +/- 0.8 and 3.1 +/- 0.4 microM, respectively. Likewise, the maximum increases in IKACh,Ado caused by AMP and adenosine were similar (122 +/- 11% versus 123 +/- 9%). In comparison, ATP and the stable analogue of AMP, adenosine monophosphorothioate (AMPS), were significantly less potent and efficacious than adenosine and AMP, and adenosine receptor antagonist 8-(p-sulfophenyl)theophylline and abolished in the presence of adenosine deaminase and alpha, beta-methylene-ADP (APCP, an inhibitor of AMP degradation). Binding of the A1-adenosine antagonist [3H]8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) to guinea pig atrial membranes treated with adenosine deaminase and APCP was reduced up to 60% by 100 microM concentrations of AMP, AMPS, and adenosine. Inosine inhibited binding by 43 +/- 3% at 100 microM, whereas hypoxanthine and xanthine had little (5-10% inhibition) and uric acid had no effect. Only 3% of AMP and 35% of AMPS were recovered intact after a 90-minute incubation at 21 degrees C with preparations of guinea pig atrial membranes. Percent displacement of [3H]DPCPX binding to atrial membranes by 100 microM AMP was significantly less in the presence of nucleoside phosphorylase and xanthine oxidase (to degrade inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine to uric acid) than in their absence (12.4 +/- 3.1% versus 49.7 +/- 1.5%). The results suggest that the observed electrophysiological actions of adenine nucleotides in cardiomyocytes are mediated by adenosine and are consistent with activation of A1-adenosine receptors.\r"

Hearts were perfused in a recirculating system with bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (10 mM). Mechanical performance, release of marker proteins for ischemic membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin, citrate synthase), and the concentrations of lactate and glucose in the perfusion medium were measured serially. Tissue metabolites were also measured. Fasting raised the myocardial glycogen content by 25%. Cardiac performance of perfused hearts from fed and fasted animals was the same during the preischemic and the post-ischemic period. The time of return of function to preischemic values was significantly less in hearts from fasted rats (2.3 versus 7.8 minutes, p less than 0.025). The release of cytosolic and mitochondrial marker proteins was significantly lower in hearts from fasted rats than in hearts from fed rats. Glucose metabolic rates during control and reperfusion were unchanged for hearts from fasted rats, but decreased for hearts from fed rats during reperfusion. The adenine nucleotide content at the end of ischemia was higher in hearts from fasted animals than in hearts from fed animals. We conclude that increasing glycogen levels prior to ischemia improves recovery of function, lessens membrane damage, and prevents loss of adenine nucleotides.\r"

  ".U": "91183630\r", 
  ".W": "Whole-cell recording techniques were used on single right atrial myocytes to study the ionic currents that may be responsible for the diverse diastolic voltage characteristics of atrial tissue. Ionic currents were activated by hyperpolarizing voltage pulses negative to -30 mV. In general, four different types of cells were identified based primarily on the ionic currents elicited during hyperpolarization. The first cell type exhibited an inward current that decayed with time at more negative voltages, reversed near the potassium equilibrium potential, inwardly rectified at more positive voltages, increased in elevated extracellular potassium, and was blocked by 3 mM barium or 10 mM cesium. This current was identified as the potassium current iK1. A second cell type exhibited a time-dependent inward current that increased at more negative voltages, had an activation range between -50 and -110 mV, had a reversal potential of -26 mV, and was blocked by 3 mM cesium. This current was identified as an if current. A third cell type exhibited an inward current that initially decayed and then became more inward with time. Barium (3 mM) abolished the initial inward current and revealed a time-dependent increasing inward current that was blocked by 3 mM cesium. This current was composed of both the iK1 and if currents. A fourth cell type exhibited only small time-independent leak currents in response to hyperpolarization. These results indicate that individual cells within the right atrium are electrophysiologically heterogeneous with respect to the types of ionic channels present in their sarcolemmal membranes. This specialization in ionic currents partially explains the diverse diastolic voltage characteristics and functional properties of atrial tissue.\r"

  ".W": "We have resolved multiple forms of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) in whole rat ventricle and in isolated rat ventricular myocytes by use of anion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. One major form, the soluble calmodulin-stimulated PDE, is apparently absent from isolated myocytes. We discern four peaks of PDE activity (designated A-D in the order of their elution) in a soluble fraction obtained from whole rat ventricle. Peak A is stimulated twofold to threefold by the addition of calcium and calmodulin (Ca2+/CalM) and preferentially hydrolyzes cGMP over cAMP (in the presence of Ca2+/CalM, KmcGMP = 1.5 microM, KmcAMP = 17 microM). Peak B has similar affinities for both cAMP and cGMP (half-maximum velocities achieved at 30 microM substrate) and demonstrates positive cooperativity with cAMP but not with cGMP. The hydrolysis of cAMP by peak B is stimulated by cGMP at substrate concentrations up to 20 microM; the maximum effect is seen at 1 microM cAMP (25-fold stimulation by 3 microM cGMP). This pattern of stimulation by cGMP results from two kinetic changes: an increase in the enzyme's apparent affinity for cAMP (apparent KmcAMP decreases from 33 to 11 microM) and the abolition of positive cooperativity. Peaks C and D selectively hydrolyze cAMP, are not stimulated by Ca2+/CalM or cGMP, and differ in their affinities for substrate (peak C, apparent KmcAMP = 7.2 microM; peak D, 0.44 microM). In addition, peak D is much more sensitive than peak C to inhibition by cGMP, cilostamide, rolipram, and milrinone. Ro20-1724 is a slightly more potent inhibitor of peak D than of peak C. Peak D appears to consist of two different enzyme activities, one inhibited by cGMP, cilostamide, and cardiotonic drugs and the other potently inhibited by rolipram. In contrast to whole ventricle, the soluble fraction of isolated rat ventricular myocytes lacks peak A. Three major peaks in myocytes are entirely analogous to peaks B, C, and D of whole ventricle in terms of the NaCl concentration at which they elute, substrate affinities, and stimulation or inhibition by various drugs and effectors. We conclude that the soluble Ca2+/CalM-stimulated PDE in whole rat ventricle is present in nonmyocyte cells.\r"

Based on both fura 2 fluorescence and aequorin luminescence measurements, qualitatively different patterns of Ca2+ mobilization occur in normal and hypertrophic rat aortic muscle. Normal rat aortic muscle contracts to phenylephrine with little or no increase in [Ca2+]i, whereas the angiotensin II-induced contraction is accompanied by a marked [Ca2+]i transient. In contrast, hypertrophic rat aortic muscle shows a dramatic increase in Ca2+ signaling after phenylephrine stimulation. Moreover, both the amplitude of the angiotensin-induced [Ca2+]i transient and the contractile sensitivity to this agonist are decreased in the hypertrophic muscle. Our results strongly suggest that the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient after agonist stimulation determines the contractile sensitivity and that there is an altered coupling of the alpha-adrenoceptor in the hypertrophic vascular muscle.\r"

  ".W": "The sensitivity of carnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A (CoA) transferase I to inhibition of its activity by malonyl-CoA is progressively reduced in mitochondria isolated from ischemic cardiac cells as blood flow decreases to 30% or less of the preocclusion flow. The activity of carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I in mitochondria isolated from nonischemic cardiac cells demonstrates incomplete inhibition, even at high concentrations of malonyl-CoA. Kinetic analyses of these data gave results most consistent with the expression of two overt enzyme activities: one activity that is sensitive to inhibition by malonyl-CoA and one activity that demonstrates little or no sensitivity to such inhibition. The decrease in malonyl-CoA-sensitive activity associated with ischemia results from a 13% decrease in the activity of the sensitive component and a corresponding 13% increase in the activity of the insensitive component. Decreased sensitivity of ischemic carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase I to inhibition by malonyl-CoA, together with potential fluctuations in the content of malonyl-CoA in tissue, would increase the synthesis of palmitoylcarnitine during ischemia and facilitate return to the use of fatty acid as a preferred metabolic fuel on reperfusion. This apparent conversion occurs concomitantly with a decrease in the free protein thiol content of the mitochondrial membranes isolated from ischemic cardiac cells. Treatment of the mitochondria from ischemic cardiac cells with dithiothreitol in vitro partially reverses the loss in sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, suggesting the possible role of thiol oxidation in the altered metabolism of ischemic mitochondria. Western blot analysis of these mitochondria using an antibody against carnitine palmitoyltransferase II purified from beef heart demonstrates a 68-kDa protein, which under ischemic conditions apparently is decreased by 2 kDa. These results are more indicative of a modification in protein folding of carnitine palmitoyltransferase than proteolytic changes during ischemia.\r"

Each artery was perfused in situ with medium 199, under conditions of simulated blood flow. To simulate the normal and abnormal blood flow waveforms at the same mean flow rate, we developed a flow apparatus capable of making various waveforms by changing the duration when the electromagnetic valve in the circuit was open. Group I (n = 7) was exposed to a steep acceleration waveform followed by a steep deceleration, as the normal flow waveform; group II (n = 7) was exposed to a gentle sloping waveform in the deceleration phase, as the abnormal flow waveform. PGI2 was measured as 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha. PGI2 production was estimated as the cumulative production for the first 5 minutes (acute response) and as the production rate after the first 30 minutes (stable production rate). Under conditions of normal flow, the acute response was 5.87 +/- 2.16 ng/cm2/5 min, whereas under conditions of abnormal flow, the rate was 2.20 +/- 0.27 ng/cm2/5 min (p less than 0.01). Stable production rates were 82.5 and 37.5 pg/cm2/min, respectively (p less than 0.05). Both the acute response and the stable production rate of PGI2 production were greater under conditions of simulated normal flow as compared with findings in the case of an abnormal flow. Our working hypothesis is that the decreased production of PGI2, as well as a deterioration in the implanted graft, under conditions of abnormal blood flow leads to a loss of late patency of the reconstructed arteries.\r"

When placed in an infrarenal location, the heart is hemodynamically unloaded and undergoes negative growth, leading to cardiac atrophy. At 7 and 14 days after transplantation, the transplanted heart was decreased in size compared with the in situ heart (p less than 0.001). To assess the possible mechanism(s) to account for this reduction in size we studied in vivo rates of total left ventricular (LV) protein synthesis, total LV RNA content, and 18S ribosomal RNA content by nucleic acid hybridization. The LV protein synthetic rate was 4.7 and 5.3 mg/day in the in situ heart and was significantly decreased to 2.9 and 2.7 mg/day in the transplanted hearts at 7 and 14 days, respectively. LV RNA content of the transplant declined to 53% and 48% of the in situ value at 7 and 14 days, respectively. Hybridization studies revealed that LV 18S ribosomal subunit content was reduced proportionately to total RNA in the heterotopic hearts. As a result of these changes, there was no significant difference in the efficiency of total LV protein synthesis between the in situ and transplanted hearts. The present studies demonstrate that the hemodynamic unloading and cardiac atrophy that is characteristic of heterotopic cardiac transplantation is accompanied by a decrease in LV total RNA content and 18S RNA, resulting in a decreased capacity for myocardial protein synthesis.\r"

In group 1 and group 2 lungs, experiments were done at constant flow and pressure. Group 3 and group 4 (each n = 4) lungs were perfused with 5% and 20% dextran 70, respectively (0 Hct); group 5 (n = 5), with 10% dextran 70; group 6 (n = 7), with 5% dextran 500; and group 7 (n = 6), with 20% dextran 70 (Hct, approximately 5%). All lungs were perfused in zone 3; airway and left atrial pressures were 6 and 8 cm H2O, respectively. To partition the circulation, we measured pressures in the pulmonary artery and left atrium continuously and pressures in 20-50-microns arterioles and 20-50-microns venules by micropuncture. We found that an increase in both the concentration and molecular weight of dextran increased perfusate viscosity and the resistance in all three longitudinal vascular segments: arteries, microvessels, and veins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To evaluate the mechanisms of action of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway, drug-induced changes in activation patterns, effective refractory periods (ERPs), and stimulation thresholds were analyzed in nine dogs with sterile pericarditis and sustained atrial flutter. Activation maps were based on 127 close bipolar recordings from a special \"jacket\" electrode. From the control map, 22 +/- 2 sites covering the slow zone and the normal zone of the reentrant circuit were selected to measure ERPs and thresholds. The excitable gap was estimated from the longest ERP during pacing at the tachycardia cycle length. During atrial flutter, epicardial activation proceeded as a single wave around an arc of functional conduction block in the proximity of the atrioventricular (AV) ring or around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc being contiguous with one of the venae cavae. An area of slow conduction, which accounted for 53 +/- 15% of the revolution time within 35 +/- 15% of the total length of the reentrant pathway, was bordered by the arc of block and the AV ring or a caval vein and the AV ring, respectively. Procainamide (5-10 mg/kg i.v.) prolonged the cycle length of atrial flutter from 144 +/- 17 to 190 +/- 24 msec (p less than 0.05) and then terminated the arrhythmia in all studies. The increase in cycle length was due to an increase in conduction time in the slow zone by 37 +/- 11 msec (86 +/- 17% of the total cycle length increase). During the last reentrant beat, conduction failed in the slow zone, with the arc of block joining the AV ring. At termination, procainamide had prolonged conduction time, stimulation threshold, and ERP in the normal zone by 11 +/- 18%, 40 +/- 80%, and 5 +/- 15%, respectively, compared with 51 +/- 16%, 86 +/- 93%, and 14 +/- 21%, respectively, in the slow zone (p less than 0.05 for all three parameters). The duration of the excitable gap did not change significantly. We conclude that procainamide preferentially affected the slow zone of single loop reentrant circuits. The drug terminated circus movement atrial flutter without abolishing the excitable gap, and its effect on conduction seemed the major determinant of the antiarrhythmic action.\r"

  ".W": "We tested the hypothesis that a selective increase in membrane current, as contrasted with the decreases in currents caused by most antiarrhythmic agents, would be an effective antiarrhythmic intervention. We studied models of early afterdepolarizations (EADs), delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs), and abnormal automaticity in single canine ventricular myocytes using intracellular microelectrodes or patch electrodes. EADs were induced by injected current, Bay K 8644 (0.5-1 microM), or ketanserin (1.0 microM); DADs were induced by ouabain intoxication (2 x 10(-7) M); and abnormal automaticity was induced by exposure to barium (0.25 mM). To increase outward K+ current, we used pinacidil and the protein kinase C activator 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu). Under control conditions, 10-100 microM pinacidil caused a concentration-dependent and reversible decrease in action potential duration and an increase in steady-state outward current; both effects were blocked by glibenclamide and thus presumably reflected changes in the ATP-regulated potassium current. Pinacidil increased the current required to induce EADs and abolished EADs caused by Bay K 8644 or ketanserin. After exposure of myocytes to ouabain, pinacidil caused a decrease in action potential duration and diminished or abolished DADs. Finally, pinacidil arrested abnormal automaticity caused by Ba2+. PDBu (30 nM) shortened action potential duration without altering plateau amplitude in some of the myocytes. In these cells the depolarizing current needed to produce an EAD was increased by over 70%; outward potassium current tails were also increased, an effect consistent with an increase of the repolarizing potassium current (IK). These findings show that each of the mechanisms for abnormal impulse generation can be effectively antagonized by an increase in outward current and suggest to us that selective augmentation of a repolarizing current, possibly IK, might be a reasonable antiarrhythmic intervention.\r"

  ".W": "The phase-resetting and entrainment properties of single pacemaker cells were studied using computer simulations in a model of the rabbit sinus nodal cell, as well as using the whole-cell patch-clamp (current-clamp) technique in isolated rabbit sinus nodal cells. Spontaneous electrical activity in the cell model was reconstructed using Hodgkin-Huxley-type equations describing time- and voltage-dependent membrane currents. In both simulations and experiments, single subthreshold current pulses (depolarizing or hyperpolarizing) were used to scan the spontaneous cycle of the cells. Such pulses perturbed the subsequent discharge, producing temporary phasic changes in pacemaker period, and enabled the construction of phase response curves. On the basis of these results, we studied entrainment characteristics of the cells. For example, application of repetitive pulses allowed for phasic changes in the spontaneous cycle and resulted in stable 1:1 entrainment at a range of basic cycle length around the spontaneous cycle, or a 2:1 pattern at basic cycle length values about half the spontaneous cycle length. Between the two entrainment zones, complex Wenckebach-like patterns (e.g., 5:4, 4:3, and 3:2) were observed. The experimental data from the isolated cell were further analyzed from a theoretical perspective, and the results showed that the topological characteristics of the phase-resetting behavior accounts for the experimentally observed patterns during repetitive stimulation of the cell. This first demonstration of phase resetting in single cells provides the basis for phenomena such as mutual entrainment between electrically coupled pacemaker cells, apparent intranodal conduction, and reflex vagal control of heart rate.\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether catecholamines have a direct effect on myosin heavy chain expression of heart myocytes or whether they act via an altered work load, myocytes from neonatal rat hearts were cultured in thyroid hormone-free media containing various positive inotropic and chronotropic agents. The velocity and frequency of contraction of the myocytes were monitored using an optoelectronic system. After 3-5 days of culture, myosin isozyme populations, cellular cAMP content, and 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake of the myocytes were determined. Compared with myocytes cultured in the absence of inotropic agents (32.6 +/- 3.5% V1), the proportion of myosin V1 was significantly (p less than 0.05) increased in the case of 1 microM isoproterenol (48.2 +/- 5.9% V1), 1 microM forskolin (57.1 +/- 11.7% V1), and 1 mM dibutyryl cAMP (79.1 +/- 2.0% V1). Dibutyryl cAMP increased V1 to a similar level as 30 nM triiodothyronine did (70.2 +/- 13.0% V1). Only a small increase was observed in myocytes cultured in the presence of 10 microM phenylephrine (40.4 +/- 8.4% V1), 10 microM ouabain (40.6 +/- 11.9% V1), or 10 microM Bay K 8644 (40.7 +/- 11.7% V1). The agents with a marked effect on myosin heavy chain expression resulted in a higher cAMP content; isoproterenol and forskolin also stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose uptake. All agents resulted in a higher velocity of contraction; with the exception of ouabain, frequency of contraction was also increased. A change in Ca2+ concentration in the medium from 1.3 to 2.4 mM resulted in a small increase in V1 (40.7 +/- 5.2% V1) but had the same effect on contraction velocity as dibutyryl cAMP did. Furthermore, 10 nM isoproterenol also increased V1 in myocytes that were arrested with 10 microM verapamil. The increase in V1 in the case of dibutyryl cAMP, isoproterenol, and forskolin is thus most probably not a correlate of the increased mechanical activity but of the high cellular cAMP content.\r"

The transplant functions as a denervated \"nonworking\" Langendorff heart; the recipient in situ heart serves as a normal control. One week after surgery, an onset of atrophy is observed in the transplanted heart, which stabilizes after 2 weeks; the in situ heart grows normally. Using this model, we increased the load of the left ventricle (LV) in the transplant by inserting a permanent polyethylene cannula into its aortic orifice during surgery to induce valvular incompetence and/or stenosis (TPE group). This resulted in significantly increased LV systolic pressure (115 +/- 5 versus 95 +/- 3 mm Hg) and a significantly increased rate-pressure product (34.7 +/- 1.7 versus 24.4 +/- 1.4 mm Hg.min-1 x 10(3) as compared with rats with control transplants (TC group). The LV mass in the TPE group decreased to only 85 +/- 4.8% of the mass of the corresponding in situ recipient heart as compared with 59 +/- 2.6% in the TC group (p less than 0.001). In three cases in the TPE group with highest overload, we observed about 20% larger LV mass in transplanted hearts as compared with the corresponding recipient in situ hearts. These results indicate that the increased load significantly attenuated the atrophy observed in LV of the isotransplants. This attenuation could be correlated with the increment of load as indicated by higher peak LV pressures and higher rate-pressure products.\r"

This study was further designed to determine the effects of topically administered opioids on pial arteriolar diameter during normotension and hypotension. Closed cranial windows were used to determine pial arteriolar diameter. Periarachnoid cortical and cisterna magna CSF was collected from piglets during normotension and hypotension (systemic arterial pressure decreased from 63 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1 mm Hg). Opioid profiles were assessed qualitatively by radioreceptor assay, and individual opioids were measured quantitatively by radioimmunoassay. Periarachnoid cortical and cisterna magna CSF methionine enkephalin-, leucine enkephalin-, dynorphin-, and beta-endorphin-like receptor active values all were increased by hypotension. When quantified by radioimmunoassay, periarachnoid cortical CSF values for methionine enkephalin-like immunoreactivity were 1,167 +/- 58 and 2,975 +/- 139 pg/ml for normotension and hypotension, respectively. Periarachnoid cortical CSF radioimmunoassay values for dynorphin-like immunoreactivity were 15 +/- 2 and 28 +/- 2 pg/ml for normotension and hypotension, respectively. When applied topically to the cortical surface, synthetic methionine enkephalin increased pial arteriolar diameter (134 +/- 4, 158 +/- 4, and 163 +/- 4 microns for control, 574 pg/ml [10(-10) M], and 5,740 pg/ml [10(-9) M], respectively). Similarly, topical synthetic leucine enkephalin and dynorphin elicited pial arteriolar dilation. However, beta-endorphin produced arteriolar constriction. Hypotension attenuated methionine and leucine enkephalin-induced dilation and reversed dynorphin-induced dilation to concentration-dependent constriction. beta-Endorphin-induced constriction was not changed by hypotension. Therefore, opioids could contribute to the control of the cerebral circulation during hypotension.\r"

In the present study, we observed that conditioned medium factors released by alpha-thrombin (10(-8) M) treatment of cultured ovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells increased neutrophil adherence to naive pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers. This effect was independent of any residual alpha-thrombin present in the medium. In contrast to thrombin-induced neutrophil adherence, adherence of neutrophils mediated by the conditioned medium was not inhibited by the anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody 60.3, indicating a CD18-independent mechanism. The factors generated by the action of alpha-thrombin on endothelial cells also resulted in concentration-dependent neutrophil migration. The neutrophil adherence- and migration-promoting activities were isolated in the ether portion after extraction of the conditioned medium. Chromatographic analysis showed that the active components (which resolved into two peaks by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography) were relatively hydrophilic low molecular weight lipids without phosphorus or amino acids. Reconstitution of these peaks indicated that they mediated neutrophil adhesion and migration responses. The results indicate that lipid factors promoting neutrophil adhesion and migration are generated by the action of thrombin on pulmonary artery endothelial cells. The generation of these factors may contribute to the amplification of the lung inflammatory response after pulmonary intravascular coagulation induced by thrombin.\r"

The maximal contractile response to methoxamine was attenuated approximately 43% (p less than 0.05) in both intact and denuded CHF rings compared with control. Conversely, norepinephrine-induced contractions were diminished 58% in intact CHF vessels and 39% in denuded CHF vessels (p less than 0.05). Denudation did not alter responses to methoxamine but significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented the tension generated by norepinephrine in both control (1.7-fold) and CHF (2.4-fold) arteries. In both intact control and CHF coronary arteries, norepinephrine elicited rapid, transient relaxations that preceded slow, sustained contractions; the initial relaxation phase was endothelium dependent, because denudation eliminated the response. Relaxations to the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT 920 were also dependent on the presence of an endothelium. At peak CHF, endothelium-dependent relaxations to norepinephrine and BHT 920 were enhanced, whereas relaxations to nitroglycerin and acetylcholine were unaltered. The data suggest that alpha-adrenergic tone in canine coronary arteries is diminished by pacing-induced CHF because of a decrease in alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction and an enhanced capacity of the endothelium to antagonize the direct vascular smooth muscle response of norepinephrine through endothelium-dependent, alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations.\r"

Pressure loading did not alter fetal arterial blood gases or vascular pressures. The right ventricular function curve (stroke volume versus mean right atrial pressure) was not significantly altered by loading. However, the relation between right ventricular stroke volume and increased arterial pressure was dramatically shifted upward, indicating improved ventricular function after the 10-day loading period. Normalized free wall of the loaded right ventricles became thicker (1.2 +/- 0.2 versus 0.9 +/- 0.2 mm/kg, p less than 0.01) and heavier (2.7 +/- 0.4 g/kg versus 2.2 +/- 0.4 g/kg, p less than 0.05) than control, and the ratio of the equatorial radius of curvature to wall thickness decreased (3.2 +/- 0.5 versus 4.5 +/- 0.9, p less than 0.005). Left ventricular free wall and septal weights and thicknesses were not significantly changed. The in vitro diastolic pressure-volume curves of both ventricular chambers of loaded hearts shifted to the left, indicating smaller ventricles than controls at physiological filling pressures. These data suggest the transduction of right ventricular loading effects to the left ventricle. Improved right ventricular function after loading is predicted by the law of Laplace based on the decreased radius of curvature-to-wall thickness ratio.\r"

Like SDRR, the correlation dimension (D2) describes variation within a sampled time series, but uniquely it reveals 1) the epoch's geometric structure and 2) the degrees of freedom of the generator. These unique features may be more sensitive predictors of mortality than SDRR. We developed a new algorithm for estimating D2 (i.e., the \"point-D2\"), tested it with known data, and found that it had greater accuracy for finite data than other published algorithms. Analysis of RR intervals from eight conscious pigs undergoing acute occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery revealed a drop in the point-D2 from a control mean and standard deviation of 2.50 +/- 0.81 to 1.58 +/- 0.64 during the first minute of ischemia (p less than 0.01) and to 1.07 +/- 0.18 during the last minute preceding ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.01). Partial occlusions (50-90% reduction of coronary blood flow) evoked point-D2 reductions only 25-30% of control (p less than 0.01). The point-D2 means were correlated between pigs with the magnitude of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (p less than 0.01), but during ischemia this correlation was replaced by one between the standard deviation of the point-D2s and SDRRs. Because the simultaneous reduction in the mean point-D2 and its standard deviation to 1.07 +/- 0.18 occurred in every case, was unique to the few minutes preceding ventricular fibrillation, and never reached these low values during other conditions in which it was reduced, we conclude that the point-D2 may be an accurate prospective predictor of mortality within the individual subject.\r"

We studied regional changes in cellular dimensions and their distribution in two models of cardiac hypertrophy and in cardiac atrophy in the rat. Combined volume-pressure overload was produced by 3,3',5-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) treatment; atrophy was produced by heterotopic isotransplantation. Our previous data from long-term pressure overload after aortic constriction were used for comparison. Isolated ventricular myocytes were obtained after in vitro coronary perfusion with collagenase. Cell volume and its distribution were determined; cell length was directly measured by image analysis, and cross-sectional area was estimated from the cell volume/cell length ratio, assuming a cylindrical model. Myocyte hypertrophy resulting from hyperthyroidism and aortic constriction was primarily due to increased cross-sectional area. In both cases, the relative response was greater in the right ventricle than in the left ventricle. Within the left ventricle, epimyocardial myocytes enlarged the most. Aortic constriction and T3 treatment predominantly increased the size of smaller myocytes. Heterogeneity in myocyte size increased after constriction but remained relatively unaffected after T3 treatment. Atrophy of left ventricular myocytes was due to a proportional decrease in cell length and cross-sectional area, with the greatest decrease in the left ventricular endomyocardium. Atrophy predominantly affected larger myocytes, resulting in a more homogeneous overall population of smaller myocytes. We conclude that various alterations in load lead to diverse remodeling in the myocyte population throughout the ventricular wall. In general, smaller myocytes show the highest growth potential, whereas larger myocytes exhibit the highest potential to atrophy.\r"

High coronary resistance values in beta-blocked animals with carotid occlusion were associated with a high degree of heterogeneity in capillary transit times, but the overall relation between coronary flow and the capillary permeability/surface area product was unchanged. The findings indicate that beta-blockade increases coronary resistance during sympathetic stimulation and, simultaneously, decreases the coronary blood flow and capillary permeability/surface area product while increasing the heterogeneity of capillary transit times.\r"

Twenty-four patients with recent myocardial infarction (New York Heart Association functional class I) and evidence of ischemic response were evaluated by means of SESTAMIBI scintigraphy performed once after exercise and then again within 2 days after mental arithmetic. Baseline, exercise, and mental stress planar scintigrams were divided into 15 segments, and each segment was reviewed and scored on a scale of 0 to 3 by experienced observers using circumferential profile analysis. Conflicting scores were resolved by consensus. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were found in 15 of 24 patients during exercise and in none during mental arithmetic. Chest pain was experienced by five patients during exercise and by none during mental stress. Twenty patients showed reversible perfusion defects during mental stress. Of the 360 pooled scintigram segments, 99 evidenced uptake defects during exercise, and 48 of these showed the same defects during mental stress. Twenty of the remaining 51 of 99 segments were adjacent to segments showing reversible hypoperfusion, suggesting milder hypoperfusion in these segments during mental arithmetic than during exercise. Furthermore, 10 segments showed reversible defects only during mental stress such that seven of these occurred in areas adjacent to those that had shown exercise-induced reversible perfusion defects, two occurred in areas that had shown fixed SESTAMIBI defects during exercise, and one occurred in a segment that had shown completely normal uptake during exercise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate the causes of the low electrocardiographic sensitivity, we recorded body surface maps during mental arithmetic in 22 normal volunteers and 37 postinfarction patients with residual exercise ischemia. Myocardial perfusion was studied with thallium-201 or technetium-99 (SESTAMIBI) planar scans. In 14 patients, body surface maps were also recorded during atrial pacing at the heart rate values achieved during mental stress. While taking the body surface maps, the area from J point to 80 msec after this point (ST-80) was analyzed by integral maps, difference maps, and departure maps (the difference between each patient's difference map and the mean difference map for normal subjects). The body surface mapping criteria for ischemia were a new negative area on the integral maps, a negative potential of more than 2 SD from mean normal values on the difference maps, and a negative departure index of more than 2. Scintigraphy showed asymptomatic myocardial hypoperfusion in 33 patients. Eight patients had significant ST segment depression. The ST-80 integral and difference maps identified 17 ischemic patients. Twenty-four patients presented abnormal departure maps. One patient presented ST depression and abnormal body surface maps without reversible tracer defect. In 14 of 14 patients, atrial pacing did not reproduce the body surface map abnormalities. The analyses of the other electrocardiographic variables showed that in patients with mental stress-induced perfusion defects, only changes of T apex-T offset (aT-eT) interval in Frank leads and changes of maximum negative potential value of aT-eT integral maps significantly differed from those of normal subjects. Our results confirm the low electrocardiographic sensitivity for detecting mental stress-induced myocardial hypoperfusion in postinfarction patients. ST analysis in the body surface map increases the information content of the electrocardiographic signal. T wave analysis appears to offer fewer diagnostic advantages.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of experimentally induced emotional stress (mental arithmetic) on different hemodynamic parameters, catecholamine levels, and serum and platelet function tests in 25 postinfarction patients and in 10 apparently healthy, age-matched control subjects. Mental stress (10 minutes) induced significant increments in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, double product, and cardiac output, indicating a sympatho-adrenal stimulation that was confirmed by a significant increase in serum epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. All of the effects disappeared at minute 10 of recovery. Concomitantly, the test produced a significant increase in platelet aggregation (induced by 3 microM ADP or 1 microgram/ml collagen), the formation of circulating platelet aggregates, and an increase in thromboxane B2 levels in plasma and serum. These effects were also rapidly reversible. Similar activation of hemodynamic parameters and a similar but less evident increase in platelet function by emotional stress were observed in control subjects. A possible artifact due to factitious platelet activation by catheter sampling was excluded with experiments in which a 40-minute rest was introduced after the baseline period and before mental stress; platelet activation did not occur during baseline or rest periods, only after emotional stress. Furthermore, the antiplatelet drug dipyridamole reduced the stress-induced formation of platelet aggregates in postinfarction patients. These results demonstrate the existence of a direct link between emotional stress and platelet function and offer an explanation of one of the mechanisms through which mental stress may be involved in the development of coronary artery disease.\r"

This research has consistently revealed that mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurs frequently during laboratory stress testing, particularly among patients with exercise-induced ischemia. This ischemia is usually silent, occurs at low heart rate elevations but with significant blood pressure increases compared with exercise-induced ischemia, and is frequently not detected when electrocardiographic markers are used alone. Exploration of factors underlying differences between mental stress- and exercise-induced ischemia has provided a means for studying the complex pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia.\r"

Five categories of mental stress testing are distinguished: problem-solving tasks, information-processing tasks, psychomotor tasks, affective conditions, and aversive or painful conditions. A series of practical and theoretical criteria are outlined for the selection of appropriate tests, and the measurement of a range of dependent variables is emphasized. The temporal stability of cardiovascular responses to mental stress tests is examined through an analysis of test-retest correlations (weighted for sample size) in 28 comparisons with intervals between sessions varying from 1 day to more than 1 year. Heart rate reactions to tasks show an average-weighted Z of 0.732 +/- 0.031 (r = 0.62), with Z = 0.575 +/- 0.034 (r = 0.52) for systolic blood pressure and Z = 0.313 +/- 0.035 (r = 0.30) for diastolic blood pressure. It is argued that the validity of mental stress tests can be judged in relation to several different aspects, specifically, methodological, ecological, diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic validities. The nature of these standards is described, and pertinent literature is presented.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the influence of mental stress on ventricular pump function in coronary patients, 88 postinfarction patients (mean age, 53 +/- 10 years) performed mental arithmetic during Swan-Ganz catheterization monitoring a mean of 44 +/- 16 days after myocardial infarction. The test lasted 3 minutes in 66 patients and 10 minutes in 22 patients. Two patients suffered acute pulmonary edema a few minutes after mental arithmetic, but no others complained of symptoms. Mean heart rate increased from 76 +/- 14 to 92 +/- 17 beats/min, mean systolic blood pressure increased from 138 +/- 22 to 160 +/- 27 mm Hg, mean diastolic blood pressure increased from 89 +/- 10 to 101 +/- 15 mm Hg, mean pulmonary wedge pressure increased from 13 +/- 6 to 19 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and mean stroke volume decreased from 72 +/- 18 to 65 +/- 18 ml (p less than 0.001) during mental arithmetic. The changes in central hemodynamics during mental arithmetic were not predictable from noninvasive parameters. In the 22 patients who performed 10-minute mental arithmetic, the changes persisted throughout mental exercise. Eighty-one patients underwent supine bicycle ergometry after mental arithmetic: Absolute mental arithmetic-pulmonary wedge pressure values correlated with those during exercise at the first stage (25 W) (r = 0.63, p less than 0.001) and at maximal load (77 +/- 29 W) (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001), and pulmonary wedge pressure change between stress values and baseline during mental arithmetic did not correlate with those during the first stage of exercise (r = 0.09, p = NS) or during maximal load (r = 0.11, p = NS). Twenty-nine patients repeated the study 1 year after myocardial infarction, and the same hemodynamic changes were observed during mental arithmetic. In conclusion, it appears that mental stress can cause deteriorations of central hemodynamics that can be independent of changes in heart rate and blood pressure and are not predictable from exercise-induced changes; stress-induced cardiovascular activation can last for at least 10 minutes and is stable over long time periods.\r"

During mental arithmetic, the ratio of peak flow velocity in early versus late diastole (E/A) and deceleration time of early diastole did not change in normal controls. However, E/A increased significantly (from 1.6 +/- 1.5 to 1.9 +/- 1.7; p less than 0.01) and deceleration time markedly decreased (from 156 +/- 49 to 108 +/- 31 msec; p less than 0.001) in patients with congestive heart failure. In 16 postinfarct patients with ejection fraction of less than 40% studied during mental arithmetic with simultaneous hemodynamics and Doppler recordings, good correlations were found between pulmonary wedge pressure and Doppler parameters (wedge pressure versus E/A, r = 0.89; wedge pressure versus deceleration time, r = -0.87). During mental arithmetic, the pulmonary wedge pressure-E/A correlation was weaker (r = 0.67), whereas the correlation between pulmonary wedge pressure and deceleration time was stronger (r = 0.91). The value of 153 msec in deceleration time was the best cutoff point in predicting 12 mm Hg pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during mental arithmetic: the higher the deceleration time, the lower the pulmonary wedge pressure, and vice versa. Among patients with congestive heart failure, five showed normal baseline deceleration time (195 +/- 21 msec; pattern 1), and the remaining four showed a short (less than 153 msec) deceleration time (108 +/- 13 msec; pattern 2). During mental arithmetic, deceleration time markedly decreased to as short as 119 +/- 20 msec in all patients except one with baseline pattern 1. Deceleration time further decreased to 75 +/- 6 msec in all patients with baseline pattern 2. Mental arithmetic induces changes in left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure. Transmitral echocardiographic Doppler provides a simple noninvasive method of estimating and monitoring pulmonary wedge pressure in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.\r"

The likelihood of this eventuality is increased when the experience is damaging, unavoidable, or uncontrollable. However, in most stressful instances, these conditions do not occur. The experience either is overcome or produces disturbances in physiological functions without structural change. The prevalence of \"functional\" disorders are far more common in medical practice than is disease. Among the most interesting of these is the hyperventilation syndrome, which may mimic or be confused with ischemic heart disease. Its symptomatology and physiology are complex. The syndrome may produce coronary vasospasm, but it may also complicate ischemic heart disease. It is even believed that chronic hyperventilation may be a risk factor for ischemic heart disease. Stressful experience consisting of various tasks and challenges may also produce myocardial perfusion deficits in ischemic heart disease, presumably secondary to vasospasm. These deficits are in turn considerably more frequent in any one patient than ST segment changes in the electrocardiogram or the incidence of angina pectoris. Vasospasm is in turn related to cardiac arrhythmias, which may occur with ischemic heart disease during a variety of stressful experiences and during outbursts of anger. Finally, the role of stressful experience in inciting ischemic heart disease and its complications remains moot.\r"

Patients also completed a standard battery of psychological tests. Psychophysiological responses were generally unrelated to age and education. Comparison of patients scoring high (more than 75%) and low (less than 25%) relative to the normal population on psychological measures indicated that heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental stress tests were significantly greater in those reporting low than in those reporting high neuroticism. The study population was subsequently divided into high, medium, and low cardiovascular responders on the basis of rate-pressure product reactions to the two stress tests. The three cardiovascular response groups did not differ in age, interval between myocardial infarction and stress testing, ejection fraction, incidence of exercise-induced ischemia, or ischemic signs during Holter monitoring. However, the high cardiovascular responders were more likely to manifest possible or definite electrocardiographic signs of ischemia or significant arrhythmia during mental stress testing than were the medium or low cardiovascular responders (50% versus 19.6% and 7%, respectively). High cardiovascular responders also reported lower levels of trait anxiety, neuroticism, psychophysiological symptoms, and depression.\r"

Furthermore, the sympathetic nervous system does not respond in a homogeneous fashion to stressors; instead, there is differential activation at various sites of the sympathetic nervous system. Despite these limitations, numerous studies document that peripheral venous samples reflect sympathetic nerve firing and are related to cardiovascular pathophysiology. Although arterial norepinephrine levels may be more sensitive than venous levels, venous levels do respond to stressors when attention is given to the time course of sampling, the imprecision of assays (and thus the requirement for larger sample sizes), and the selection of appropriate tasks. In addition to catecholamines, there are other compounds that may be used to index sympathetic nervous system responses to stressors. Chromogranin A, as measured in antecubital blood, responds to large-scale perturbations of the sympathetic nervous system but appears relatively insensitive to short-term behavioral challenge. In response to stressors, diastolic blood pressure is better predicted by plasma levels of renin than of norepinephrine.\r"

To account for the effects on respiration produced by talking, this study was performed with two different procedures: the I.K.T. (i.e., a computer-controlled mental task that is performed in silence and does not entail human confrontation) and a stressful interview. Finally, we assessed whether ischemic heart disease modifies the spectral changes induced by psychological stress by comparing a group of healthy subjects (age, 38 +/- 2 years) with a group of patients (age, 52 +/- 3 years) recovering from 1-month-old myocardial infarctions. The findings indicate that psychological stress induced marked changes in the sympathovagal balance, which moved toward sympathetic predominance. The low-frequency component of RR variability, a marker of sympathetic activity, increased from 58 +/- 5 normalized units (NU) to 68 +/- 3 NU with the I.K.T. and to 76 +/- 3 NU with the interview. This increase was absent in the group of post-myocardial infarction patients. However, arterial pressure increased significantly in both groups of subjects. The possibility of age playing an important role in determining the differences observed was disproved by the findings of a marked increase in low frequency with mental stimuli in an additional group of borderline hypertensive subjects with ages (55 +/- 2 years) comparable to those of post-myocardial infarction patients.\r"

Biobehavioral factors included both psychosocial (depression, anxiety, social support, type A behavior, mood, defensiveness, and anger expressiveness) and psychophysiological (heart rate and blood pressure reactivity to a videogame stressor) variables. Data were collected at baseline and at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-ups. Of the 502 patients enrolled in CAPS, 353 participated in the behavioral studies component. At baseline, assessments of psychosocial variables revealed the CAPS study population to be generally similar to other heart disease populations, and no relation between these variables and psychophysiological reactivity or arrhythmias was found. At follow-up among patients assigned to the placebo condition, biobehavioral variables were not related to levels of VPCs or VPC suppression. Cox regression analyses revealed that type B behavior, depression, and reduced heart rate reactivity were associated with increased clinical events, even after controlling for baseline left ventricular ejection fraction, myocardial infarction before the qualifying event, use of beta-blockers, use of digitalis, Q wave of qualifying myocardial infarction, and presence of unsustained ventricular tachycardia on baseline electrocardiogram. It is hypothesized that the relation among reduced heart rate reactivity, depression, and clinical events is mediated by diminished cardiac vagal tone.\r"

  ".W": "All of the electrophysiological mechanisms of arrhythmias are sensitive to the influences of the autonomic nervous system, particularly to its adrenergic limb. Arrhythmogenic areas may also be dependent on the inhomogeneity of these influences because of their pathophysiological structure and/or the neurogenic or humoral nature of the vector of modulation. The complexity of the various possible scenarios, combined with the role of the rate dependence, explains why standardized protocols exploring the autonomic nervous system in clinical arrhythmias are difficult to define. Invasive electrophysiology is not adapted to address the problem. Isoprenaline infusion only reproduces the humoral adrenergic stimulation to which only a few types of arrhythmias are sensitive. The exercise test is a very complex investigation if the multiple parameters involved are considered. Only a part of its limitations are obviated by the mental stress. Under natural conditions, the neurogenic origin, the intensity of the sympathetic stimulation, and its suddenness are all critical factors responsible for severe tachyarrhythmias. Arrhythmias of the long QT syndrome are particularly demonstrative of the importance of the autonomic nervous system, but this evidence can also be documented in more trivial circumstances of diseased or apparently undiseased hearts. Exploring the autonomic nervous system behavior through heart rate variability in ambulatory recordings is the most recent and fruitful method of investigation. This nonprovocative approach has technical obstacles and practical and theoretical limitations related to the fundamental nature of the autonomic nervous system, which is both a marker of the cardiac status and a determinant of arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "The idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) represents a unique clinical example of stress-related sudden cardiac death. LQTS is characterized by the association of several distinctive electrocardiographic features, among which prolongation of the QT interval is the best known, with life-threatening arrhythmias that usually occur under conditions of physical or psychological stress. Effective therapies exist and are represented by antiadrenergic interventions; beta-adrenergic-blocking agents are the treatment of choice. When they fail, left cardiac sympathetic denervation has also proven to be very effective. The latter result suggests a role for alpha-adrenergic mechanisms in the arrhythmias of LQTS. The stressors more frequently associated with syncopal events in LQTS patients include fear, exercise fraught with emotions, swimming, and awakening because of a loud noise. Experimentally, life threatening arrhythmias have been induced during a highly emotional situation in conscious cats with normal hearts in which right stellate ganglia have been ablated, resulting in QT interval prolongation. This selective denervation creates a sympathetic imbalance of the type proposed by one of the pathogenetic hypotheses for LQTS.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental models have been developed to investigate the influences of anger, fear, and sleep on coronary blood flow. Studies of anger in dogs with coronary stenosis indicate that the postarousal phase is particularly conducive to myocardial ischemia. Specifically, a delayed coronary vasoconstrictor response has been observed within 1-3 minutes after cessation of behavioral arousal. The response is prevented by bilateral stellectomy and can be elicited in anesthetized animals by electrical stimulation of the right or left stellate ganglion. The latter effect is averted by alpha-adrenergic blockade with prazosin. Although the basis for the protracted nature of the delayed vasoconstriction remains to be clarified, the current hypothesis is that the phenomenon results from a time-dependent imbalance between the vasoconstrictor effects of adrenergic input and the vasodilator influences of coronary pressure and/or cardiac metabolic activity. A behavioral model emulating the fear state has also been developed. When dogs that fail to exhibit anger are placed in a food-access confrontation protocol, the animals demonstrate a fearlike state evidenced by a cowering posture and somatic tremor. There is a distinct plasma catecholamine profile that is characterized by a predominant increase in epinephrine compared with norepinephrine. This is in contrast to the pattern observed during anger, in which a prevalent increase in norepinephrine is observed. Fear results in significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, and coronary arterial flow. Sleep is also associated with substantial alterations in coronary hemodynamic function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The psychological test consisted of presenting food to a fasting but restrained animal for 3 minutes. In group 1, stress increased the heart rate from 128 +/- 5 to 176 +/- 8 beats/min (mean +/- SEM) and arterial pressure from 93 +/- 4 to 112 mm Hg. Comparing the individual increase in rate-pressure product with the increase in coronary conductance during the test, a parallel response was found in only two animals, whereas a relatively lower coronary conductance was observed in the remainder, suggesting vasoconstriction. Clinical signs of ischemia or life-threatening arrhythmias were never observed in this group of animals. Each group 2 animal underwent two occlusions of the left anterior descending coronary artery, randomly performed on separate days both in the presence and the absence of the food deprivation stress. When the latter was applied in the presence of occlusion, all animals developed ventricular fibrillation in less than 2 minutes (mean, 81.4 seconds). Conversely, only one animal had ventricular fibrillation when a 3-minute occlusion was performed without exposure to stress. This occurred despite the fact that more severe ischemia (as detected by an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and decreases in dP/dt and systolic pressure) was recorded at 3 minutes of occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Fifty subjects (group 1) were selected as a consecutive population of ischemic patients with electrocardiographic documentation of ischemia at rest, on effort, or both. Mental arithmetic induced increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and rate-pressure product in all patients. Transient ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred in 22 patients (44%; positive mental arithmetic), the majority of whom had both resting and exercise angina. In negative mental arithmetic tests, peak rate-pressure product was always lower than that achieved during exercise (mean +/- SD, 11.9 +/- 3 versus 21.3 +/- 5, p less than 0.01). Of the 22 patients with positive mental arithmetic tests, ischemia occurred in only six, at a rate-pressure product equal to or more than the one achieved during exercise (21.1 +/- 5 versus 19.4 +/- 4, p less than 0.01), suggesting an increase in myocardial O2 demand exceeding the limited increase in flow; in the remaining 16 patients, rate-pressure product values were significantly lower (14.8 +/- 3 versus 22.7 +/- 6, p less than 0.01), suggesting a primary reduction in coronary blood flow that is probably related to an increase in coronary tone. To assess the possible site of such a vasoconstriction, the effect of mental arithmetic on large coronary artery diameter was tested in 13 additional unselected patients (group 2) undergoing coronary angiography for a chest pain syndrome.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The addition of a heterogeneous class of compounds, \"second-line\" therapy (previously known as disease-modifying antiinflammatory rheumatic drugs), is advocated to modify the disease course itself. Second-line treatments include antimalarials, gold salts, D-penicillamine, azathioprine, and methotrexate. Randomized placebo-controlled trials ahve demonstrated the efficacy of these compounds in RA. Improvement in standard parameters of disease activity including the number of painful and swollen joints, duration of morning stiffness, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate has been noted with these second-line drugs. Whether they modify roentgenographic progression is under rigorous study. These agents alone or in combination rarely induce complete disease remission. Therefore, newer therapies are under intensive investigation and include sulfasalazine, cyclosporin A, and combination therapy.\r"

Five knees with total condylar prostheses required revision: one for chronic instability, one for a late posttraumatic patellar fracture, and three for late hematogenous infections. The total condylar prostheses with patellar resurfacing had better scores for pain (8.5 points) than the polycentric prosthesis without patellofemoral resurfacing (7.0 points).

Clinical evaluation was based on a 10-point maximum rating scale, and ratings for pain, walking, function, and activity improved from preoperative values to the most recent follow-up examination. Revision THA was performed for aseptic acetabular loosening in four hips, and femoral loosening in one hip. Sepsis occurred in another four hips. Complications of wound healing occurred in 14 hips. Roentgenographic evidence of loosening was seen in six acetabular components, in three femoral components, and in the femoral and acetabular component of one hip; none of these hips have as yet required revision THA. The Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis revealed a 93% survival probability at seven years, which fell to 77% at 12 years in these patients. A trend was that younger, larger patients had increased failure and component loosening rates. Cemented primary THA has been a satisfactory operation in the rheumatoid patient. The relatively high rate of wound healing problems and sepsis may be due to the systemic immune nature of rheumatoid arthritis; however, 25% of these prosthetic hips either failed or are at risk for future failure. Thus, improved techniques are still necessary to increase the long-term success of THA in the rheumatoid patient.\r"

By varying the order of serial release of the medial collateral ligament complex and removal of the radial head, each structure's contribution to valgus stability against the effect of gravity was determined. In the otherwise intact elbow, absence of the radial head does not significantly alter the three-dimensional characteristics of motion in the elbow joint. Isolated medial collateral release, on the other hand, causes increases in abduction rotation of about 6 degrees-8 degrees in magnitude. Releasing both structures results in gross abduction laxity and elbow subluxation. This study defines the medial collateral ligament (MCL) as the primary constraint of the elbow joint to valgus stress and the radial head as a secondary constraint. This definition facilitates the proper management of patients with radial head fractures and MCL disruption. The comminuted radial head fracture uncomplicated by MCL insufficiency should be treated by excision without the need for an implant and without concern of altering the normal kinematics of the elbow.\r"

A sclerotic border and osteoid seams were noted, two features that seem not to have been previously reported in early lesions. Recent papers suggest intraosseous lipomas are more common than previously thought, and the femur now accounts for 25% of reported cases.\r"

Pathologically, RA is characterized by a destructive synovitis in multiple diarthrodial joints and immunologically by the presence in serum and joint fluid of autoantibodies to IgG (rheumatoid factor). The diagnosis remains a clinical one and, as such, RA investigations use epidemiologic methodologies. It is now clear that there is an important genetic contribution to the etiology of RA evidenced by the association of the disease with HLA-DR4, an allele of the major histocompatibility complex located on the short arm of chromosome six. HLA associations with RA occur in several different populations. This genetic epidemiologic approach substantiates the HLA association with disease and lays the foundation for recent molecular genetic discoveries that are reviewed, particularly the MHC structure and function.\r"

After this, the length of the transducers in the anterior bundle increased, whereas those in the posterior bundle remained shortened. Transducers in the anterior and posterior bundles of the PCL, on the other hand, showed maximum lengthening peaks at approximately 50 degrees and 0 degrees flexion, respectively. The middle bundle of the PCL showed a smaller change. When simulated quadriceps forces were applied, the transducers in the ACL lengthened and those in the PCL shortened. At more than 90 degrees, however, the changes in length decreased. After cutting the ACL, the quadriceps force increased the shortening of the PCL.\r"

The condition develops because of contracture of peripatellar tissues, fatpad tissues, and quadriceps weakness, and may rapidly progress to permanent patella infera and disabling patellofemoral arthrosis. Case studies for five patients with acute developmental patella infera are described. All patients required an early arthroscopic release of contracted tissues. To establish normal right to left patellar, vertical-height ratios, lateral roentgenograms were obtained in 202 normal knees (101 pairs). The data showed that although essentially no difference existed between right and left sides, large variations existed in the ratios from one individual to another (range, 0.75-1.46). Thus, the diagnosis of developmental patella infera requires comparison of patellar height ratios in the same knee or between knees in the same individual. A decrease in the vertical-height ratio of 11%-15%, depending on the method used, indicates developmental patella infera.\r"

In children younger than 11 years of age, there was a significant correlation between fracture correction and change in epiphyseal plate angulation, with the highest degree of correction being 13 degrees. In children older than 11 years, no correlation was found, and the degree of fracture correction was unpredictable. The study points to an important influence of the epiphyseal plate on fracture remodeling, which decreases in late childhood.\r"

Light and electron microscopic immunolocalization studies have shown that calbindin-D9k is present in cartilage and bone. In cartilage, it is restricted to the mature chondrocytes. In bone, it is present in osteoblasts and osteocytes. In both, its synthesis is vitamin D dependent. While calbindin-D9k is a strictly cytosolic protein in soft tissues, it has a specific distribution in mineralized tissues and may even be extracellular. Hence, it is restricted to the lateral edges of the longitudinal septa in the epiphyseal cartilage, the same area in which matrix vesicles are found. Calbindin-D9k lies within the matrix vesicles and is also found in the matrix vesicles near the mineralizing front of trabecular and compact bone. It seems to remain in position over the crystallites formed from the matrix vesicles in fully calcified cartilage and in heavily mineralized bone. The protein is also present in teeth, in the ameloblasts of incisors and molars but not in odontoblasts. The data suggest that calbindin-D9k is required for mineral nucleation in the matrix vesicles of epiphyseal cartilage and bone. The synthesis and distribution of calbindin-D9k in normal and rachitic normal bone and cartilage indicate that vitamin D has a direct action on mineralizing tissues.\r"

Such defects may affect the bone-implant interface response because of increased local metallic corrosion and ion release. Using a canine transcortical push-out model, the interface mechanics and histology of HA-coated titanium and cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy implants with and without coating defects were evaluated. The coating defects extended through the HA material to the underlying metallic substrate. Interface mechanical testing and undecalcified histologic techniques were used to evaluate differences in interface response at three, five, six, ten, 12, and 32 weeks postimplantation. There were no statistically significant differences between the HA-coated implants with and without defects for either interface shear strength or stiffness; however, both HA-coated implant types developed significantly greater interface strength and stiffness when compared to uncoated metallic implants. Histologically, in all areas away from the defect, a progression to nearly complete mineralization of osseous tissue directly onto the HA-coated surface was observed with no interpositional fibrous tissue layer. At early time periods (up to six weeks) in the area of the coating defect, bone apposition and mineralization appeared to stop at the edge of the HA coating. At later time periods (greater than ten weeks), the area of the defect was filled with mineralized osseous tissue in approximately one-half of the specimens. A thin fibrous interpositional layer was observed at the interface of the exposed metal substrate.\r"

Sutured and unsutured MCLs were studied four and 14 weeks postoperatively. Both fluorescent thin nerve strands and small dotlike nerve terminals were regularly seen in the healing zone and in the adjacent normal ligamentous tissue, suggesting innervation of such structures by neuropeptide nerves. All three neuropeptides were more abundant in sutured ligaments than in unsutured ligaments, which may suggest beneficial effects of the apposition of the torn ligament ends on local nerve regeneration. Active involvement of the neural elements in the healing process was also suggested by kinetic studies showing a decrease in Substance P and CGRP staining as well as an increase in galanin staining during the study period. These changes in the periphery parallel the reactive changes earlier described in the dorsal root ganglion and dorsal horn cells occurring after a peripheral nerve injury. This may depend on the antidromic transport to the periphery of neuropeptides synthesized in the central nervous system. This experimental neuroimmunohistochemical mapping study and the known effects of neuropeptides on blood vessels, macrophages, and fibroblasts should stimulate further work on the role of innervation in ligamentous healing.\r"

Within five weeks, all animals developed clinical signs of osteomyelitis. The findings were verified by roentgenograms and bone scans. There was a significant rise in titers against the inoculated B. fragilis strain in every rabbit, and when killed at 18 weeks after the bacterial inoculation cultures containing the inoculated strain were obtained from all animals. No other bacterial strains were isolated. With one exception, cultures were positive in samples from both the inoculated and the control side, indicating hematogenous seeding. In one animal, the cultures from the inoculated side were negative, whereas on the control side, there was significant growth of the inoculated strain. Histologic examination of the infection sites showed low-grade chronic osteitis. In contrast to previous studies, which have indicated severe difficulty in obtaining a single-strain anaerobic osteomyelitis, the present method gives a high infection rate with reproducible immunologic, roentgenographic, and histologic reactions.\r"

Epstein-Barr virus, parvoviruses, and retroviruses are considered by some investigators to be the primary candidates. An increasing body of data, on the other hand, appears to implicate bacteria or their products in the syndrome. Important evidence has surfaced in support of this view. Lyme arthritis, a disease caused by a bacterium, can mimic RA. Bacteria and their products have been conclusively linked to many forms of inflammatory \"reactive\" arthropathies. RA-like diseases can be induced in certain inbred strains of rats with bacterial cell-wall fragments, e.g., streptococcal and other bacterial peptidoglycans. Immunologic relationships between host and bacterial peptidoglycans, relevant to RA, have been well documented, e.g., heat shock proteins, bacterial IgG Fc binding proteins, and rheumatoid factors. These data not only support the hypothesis that bacteria may play an important role in RA but also indicate that current concepts of infection and autoimmune disease are broadening and overlapping.\r"

Each of these three models has contributed clues to our understanding of RA and have yielded promising new approaches to treatment. These include combination pharmacotherapy, antigen-specific therapy, cell-specific therapy, and monoclonal antibody therapy. All of these immunotherapeutic interventions have been shown to be beneficial in one or more animal systems. This suggests that future therapies for RA and other human autoimmune diseases may be more immunoselective and, potentially, less toxic.\r"

Subsequently, they emigrate from the circulation when they become attracted to joint spaces of rheumatoid arthritis patients by chemoattractants such as the complement split product, C5a, and leukotriene B4. Exposure to immune complexes, rheumatoid factor, and cytokines in the synovial fluid results in neutrophil activation with release of granule contents, toxic oxygen metabolites, and proinflammatory products of the arachidonic acid cascade. This process is analogous to a local Arthus reaction in which activation of the complement system is a central event. Some of the inflammatory materials released by this reaction contribute to the cartilage destruction seen in rheumatoid arthritis. Because others are chemoattractants themselves, they perpetuate intraarticular inflammation and permit the predominance of acute inflammatory cells in lesions maintained by chronic inflammation.\r"

Early morning joint stiffness and symmetric polyarticular inflammation, particularly in the metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, wrist, and metatarsophalangeal joints, are typical of the disease. Extraarticular disease, including rheumatoid nodules, is usually associated with severe and well-established arthritis, and occular, pulmonary, cardiac, neurologic, and vasculitic involvement can be a considerable source of morbidity. Serologic testing for rheumatoid factor (RF) is helpful in confirming the diagnosis since 80% of patients are seropositive, but RFs are expressed in many other disease states. Expression of multiple RF isotypes differentiates RA from other populations. Erythrocyte sedimentation rates, C-reactive protein levels, circulating immune complexes, and platelet counts are often elevated in RA and serve as indicators of disease activity.\r"

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proven to be an excellent noninvasive method to evaluate the spine, shoulder, hip, and knees; its use for the evaluation of smaller joints is still being investigated. In patients with RA, MR imaging has been used to evaluate cervical spine instability, rotator cuff tear, osteonecrosis, and osteomyelitis. Patients with RA may have advanced osteoporosis, predisposing to insufficiency fractures. This includes fractures associated with increased activity after hip or knee arthroplasty. Newer methods for measuring the degree of osteoporosis include single photon absorptiometry, dual photon absorptiometry, quantitative computed tomography (CT), and dual-energy projection radiography. It has not yet been determined which of these methods will be most widely used in the future, but quantitative CT and dual-energy projection radiography currently show the most promise. Ultrasonography provides an excellent noninvasive method for the diagnosis of popliteal cysts, and color Doppler sonography can differentiate cyst and popliteal aneurysm. As compared to radiography or conventional CT, high-resolution CT provides an improved method to detect the early changes of RA in the lung parenchyma.\r"

  ".W": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic idiopathic disease characterized by persistent inflammation of the synovium, local destruction of bone and cartilage, and a variety of systemic manifestations. Although the etiologic stimulus has not been identified, rheumatoid synovitis is characterized by persistent immunologic activity, with CD4(+)/CD29(+) memory T cells prominently involved. Many of the local and systemic manifestations of RA appear to result from the production of a variety of cytokines within the inflamed synovium. A number of other inflammatory mediators produced in the rheumatoid synovium, including arachidonic acid metabolites, vasoactive amines, platelet-activating factor, and complement cleavage products contribute to the inflammatory process. In addition, the local production of immunoglobulin and the autoantibody, rheumatoid factor, along with the local production of immune complexes and complement activation, play a major role in the destructive potential of rheumatoid synovitis. The driving force behind rheumatoid inflammation, however, is likely to be CD4(+) T cells responding to an antigenic epitope in the synovium in an HLA-DR restricted manner. Understanding the immunopathogenic process underlying rheumatoid inflammation should provide insight into approaches to control the disease effectively and specifically.\r"

  ".W": "Aspirin, nonacetylated salicylates, and numerous other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients to decrease joint inflammation and improve function. The choice of medication and its optimum dosage must be individualized because of marked intersubject variations in drug metabolism, excretion, antiinflammatory and analgesic efficacy, and susceptibility to adverse effects. Equivalent doses of aspirin and of nonacetylated salicylates are equally antiinflammatory in RA, although the nonacetylated salicylate is a poor inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis. Chronopharmacology studies suggest that many patients may have better efficacy and fewer side effects with evening doses than with morning doses of certain NSAIDs; however, the optimum time must be individualized by trial and error because some patients do better with other regimens. The gastric, renal, and platelet adverse effects of NSAIDs are related to their inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, and tend to be related to dose and intensity of therapy. Various strategies can minimize the impact of these side effects, such as coadministration of gastric protectants or the use of short half-life NSAIDs to decrease the duration of preoperative NSAID withdrawal needed to ensure adequate platelet coagulation during surgery. An intramuscular analgesic NSAID is now available and is reported to be equivalent to morphine sulfate in some painful postsurgical conditions. Although associated with many problems, chronic corticosteroid therapy is, or has been, a major therapeutic component for many RA patients who consequently are unable to respond adequately to the stresses of general anesthesia and surgery because of complete or partial adrenal insufficiency. These patients must be given appropriate supplemental corticosteroid therapy perioperatively.\r"

The physicians were sent a postcard survey asking whether they had used the PSC in their practices. Of the 157 (78%) who responded to the postcard survey, 36 (23%) reported that they had used the PSC. On a follow-up questionnaire, all of these physicians rated the PSC as useful, and nearly 80% reported that it led to increased case-finding and/or referrals. Ninety-six percent stated that they will continue to use the PSC; more than half of them routinely or frequently. The findings indicate a widespread interest in psychosocial screening, and suggest that additional educational efforts may be necessary to support the acceptance of the PSC in pediatric practice.\r"

  ".W": "Controversy in the literature exists over whether or not it is beneficial to maintain a patient on dialysis for a prolonged time before transplantation. Because no data exist comparing children who have had prolonged dialysis before transplantation to those who have none, we reviewed the charts of all children transplanted at the Children's Hospital of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Of those, we selected three groups for analysis: group one (n = 12) consisted of patients who had had less than or equal to 10 weeks of dialysis before transplantation (6.8 +/- -2.2 weeks, +/- = SD); group two (n = 21) were patients who had had more than 10 weeks of dialysis (142 + +/- -148 weeks). Both groups had two years of follow-up data. Group three (n = 13) consisted of patients who had had less than two years of follow-up (18.7 +/-/-7 months) but no dialysis before transplantation. There were no differences in mode of dialysis between groups one and two nor in the type of transplant (living-related donor vs. cadaveric). Significantly, the patients in group three received more cyclosporine A and less anti-lymphocyte globulin than the other two groups (p less than 0.05). Patients in group two received more transfusions (11.9 +/- 14.3) than patients in group one (4.0 +/- 2.7) and group three (3.5 +/- 7.3). There were no differences in number of patients who experienced at least one rejection episode among the three groups. Although the mean serum creatinine concentration at two years of follow-up was higher in group two (3.6 +/- -3.9 mg/dl), this was not significantly different from group one (1.7 +/- -0.7 mg/dl) or group three (1.9 +/- -0.5, n = 7). Sixty-three percent of patients in group one, 60% of patients in group two and 91% in group three had functioning allografts at two years follow-up. Although there may be other considerations, our data do not indicate any increase in rejection or decrease in graft survival in children who do not receive prolonged dialysis.\r"

An indepth historical review of pulmonary surfactant by Tierney was recently published. In the years since 1959, there has been an exhaustive amount of research aimed at elucidating the structure and function of pulmonary surfactant, the ultimate goal being a safe and effective exogenous surfactant for the treatment of the Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). The days of surfactant research are far from over, but the era of surfactant replacement therapy is now upon us. The practitioner needs to be knowledgeable about surfactant and aware of his or her role in surfactant therapy for premature infants. The following is intended to clarify some of the important issue of surfactant replacement.\r"

Pulmonary function tests showed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect (vital capacity = 0.67 L) with adequate oxygenation and alveolar ventilation as reflected by arterial blood gas testing during quiet wakefulness. However, continuous noninvasive oximetry demonstrated desaturation to 85 percent while eating. These transient episodes of desaturation were abolished by the administration of supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal prongs. Following the prescription of supplemental oxygen, dysphagia resolved immediately, with weight gain following over several weeks. We conclude that dysphagia may be a presenting feature of hypoxemia. This case report draws attention to the usefulness of continuous noninvasive monitoring of oxygenation and the clinical importance of at least some transient hypoxemic events.\r"

To verify the validity of this assumption, we determined the ventricular rate during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 13 patients receiving long-term digoxin therapy (mean plasma digoxin level + 1.28 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) and compared it with that of a group of 14 patients who had not taken digoxin or beta-adrenergic and calcium-blocking agents before the attack. The treated and the untreated groups were similar statistically. The mean ventricular rate of the digitalized patients was 121 +/- 15 beats per minute, while that of the patients in the control group was 118 +/- 16 beats per minute. It is concluded that long-term digoxin therapy is not effective in reducing the ventricular response in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation despite adequate therapeutic levels.\r"

Endurance measurements, including sustained submaximal performance on a cycle ergometer and the 12-minute walk distance (1,349 +/- 625 feet to 1,700 +/- 670 feet) increased significantly (p less than 0.01), as did multiple educational and subjective parameters. Maximal exercise performance on a graded cycle test improved very little, with a decline in the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen consumption (VE/VO2) being the only significant change (48.2 +/- 28.3 L/ml to 36.6 +/- 8.7 L/ml). Of the observed changes, only one endurance measurement, the sustained submaximal exercise performance, correlated with FEV1 (r = 0.5, p less than 0.01), but only if it was expressed as an absolute number (liters) and not as percent predicted. Lung function did not correlate with changes in the 12-minute walk distance, in maximal exercise performance on the cycle ergometer or with changes in educational and subjective parameters. We conclude that because the magnitude of change in both physiologic and psychologic parameters was not directly related to lung function, the benefits of rehabilitation can extend to all patients with chronic lung disease, regardless of the severity of preexisting pulmonary dysfunction.\r"

The 12MD increased by 27.7 +/- 32.5 percent, or 462 +/- 427 ft, by the end of the program. There were no significant relationships between improvement in the 12MD and age, sex, oxygen requirement, arterial blood gas levels, and pulmonary function; however, patients with a greater ventilatory reserve (1-[VEmax/MVV] x 100) had more improvement in their 12MD, both with respect to distance and percentage of increase over baseline. Additionally, patients with a lower peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and peak oxygen pulse (O2P) showed greater percentage of improvement in their 12MD. The magnitude of the initial 12MD was inversely related to its improvement, both with regard to distance (r = -0.43; r2 = 0.18; p less than 0.003) and percentage of increase (r = -0.71; r2 = 0.51; p less than 0.0001). Using stepwise regression, the combination of smaller initial 12MD and greater FEV1 was significantly predictive of improvement in the 12MD. Patients with poor performance on either a 12MD or maximal exercise test are not necessarily poor candidates for a pulmonary rehabilitation program.\r"

Carle Hospital. Tumors were more often located centrally and superiorly. No preference as to side was found. Squamous carcinomas were, by far, the most frequent cell type. Forceps biopsies, brushings, and washings were positive in 79 percent, 38 percent, and 32 percent of the obtained specimens, respectively. Bronchoscopically, squamous and small-cell carcinomas were more often visualized as central tumor-like lesions, which were better diagnosed by forceps biopsies. Adenocarcinomas, on the contrary, were more frequently peripheral and showed infiltrative, compressive, or aspecific findings. In these latter tumors, cytologic studies were more fruitful. Large-cell anaplastic carcinomas had an intermediate behavior. Cell type, endoscopic appearance, and diagnostic success are interrelated features. Visible characteristics at bronchoscopy can therefore anticipate the more likely histotype and guide the diagnostic approach.\r"

At both doses, amrinone significantly (p less than 0.05) increased HR, but decreased mean arterial, mean pulmonary artery, central venous and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures. High-dose amrinone significantly decreased systemic vascular resistance. Arterial oxygen saturation decreased significantly following both low- (97.8 +/- 0.4 to 95.6 +/- 0.9 percent) and high- (98.8 +/- 3.4 to 93.9 +/- 1.2 percent) dose amrinone. Pulmonary shunt increased significantly following low-dose amrinone and markedly increased Qs/Qt after high-dose amrinone.

  ".W": "A reduction in lung volume is used to diagnose physiologic restriction in the pulmonary function tests of patients with lung disease. Airflow obstruction is commonly associated with hyperinflation of static lung volume. Because restriction and obstruction exert opposite effects on lung volumes, we questioned whether the lack of hyperinflation of static lung volumes could indicate the presence of concomitant restriction in patients with airflow obstructive ventilatory defects. To assess this, we evaluated by pulmonary function tests and chest roentgenograms of 58 patients with airflow obstruction (group 1), 18 of whom then sustained various types of resection for lung cancer (group 2) as a type of superimposed restriction. We selected 80 percent of predicted as the lower limit of \"normal\" frequently used by clinical pulmonary function laboratories. Despite a statistically significant decrease in total lung capacity (p less than 0.05) for the postpneumonectomy patients, when the static lung volume measurements of the patients with resection were evaluated, no one lung volume showed a consistent reduction sufficient to detect the superimposed restriction in all these patients. Using 80 percent of predicted as \"normal,\" 61 percent of our patients with airflow obstruction and superimposed restriction would have been missed. We conclude that it is clinically difficult, based on only static lung volume measurements alone, to detect restriction superimposed on the hyperinflation of airflow obstruction unless these lung volumes are reduced to below accepted \"normal\" limits.\r"

The first group had what was considered a positive reaction (a fall of at least 15 percent in FEV1) whereas the second group's reaction was interpreted as negative (fall in FEV1 less than 15 percent). Although the correlation in terms of percentage of change from baseline values was statistically significant, the correspondence was poor. PEFR proved far less sensitive than FEV1 in detecting a reaction. Whereas the mean maximum change in FEV1 overall was 27 percent, the mean maximum change in PEFR at the same time interval was only 16 percent. Moreover, individual correlations between the percentage of change in FEV1 and PEFR were satisfactory (r2 greater than 0.80) in only 32/88 subjects (36 percent). No subject who was considered to have a negative challenge according to FEV1 had a change in PEFR greater than 20 percent. We therefore conclude that changes in PEFR are far less sensitive than changes in FEV1 in detecting responses during late reactions to occupational sensitizers.\r"

Data from this investigation indicate that 78 outpatients from a medical center in the southeastern region of the United States were prescribed an average of 6.26 medications with both various dosing schedules and different modes of administration. Adherence was poor, with 42 patients (54 percent) underutilizing medications, 39 patients (50 percent) overutilizing medications during periods of respiratory distress, and 24 patients (31 percent) employing ineffective inhaler dosing techniques. Prescription patterns and adherence were not associated with demographic variables; however, adherence was related to classes of medication and situational variables.\r"

  ".W": "Six pulse oximeters with finger probes were studied in three groups of 17 hypoxemic patients with COPD aged 50 to 75 years. Transcutaneous arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) was measured with the Nellcor N101 (oximeter 1a), the Ohmeda Biox III (oximeter lb), the Nellcor N200 (oximeter 2a), the Critikon Oxyshuttle (oximeter 2b), the Radiometer Oxi100 (oximeter 3a), and the Ohmeda Biox 3700 (oximeter 3b). The SpO2 was compared with SaO2 measured in simultaneously withdrawn samples of arterial blood (Radiometer OSM2) at three 20-minute steady-state levels of FIO2 ranging from 0.21 to 0.40 (SaO2, 62 to 100 percent). The bias (mean SpO2-SaO2 difference) and the error in precision (SD of the differences) were both below 4 percent for instruments 1a and 1b and remained below 1.2 and 3 percent, respectively, for the others. A good agreement between SpO2 and SaO2, as reflected by the Bartko intraclass correlation coefficient, was observed in instruments 2a, 3a, and 3b. The individual relationships between SpO2-SaO2 differences and SaO2 appeared to be linear and parallel. With four instruments (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b), the mean slope of this relationship was negative, showing a systematic instrumental error: the lower the SaO2, the larger the overestimation of SaO2. The scattering of the data (precision) principally reflects a subject source of error. In most instruments a technical adjustment could greatly improve instrumental errors and accuracy. The correction of the errors due to between-subject variation would require a system of calibration adjustable by the users to each individual.\r"

It is usually prescribed for nightly use; however, recent studies show that patients often do not wear the appliance consistently. Previous studies have also suggested that nasal CPAP may improve a patient's underlying OSA even when the mask is not in place. We investigated 12 men with OSA to see if nasal CPAP used nightly for six weeks would improve their underlying sleep-disordered breathing. We also studied pharyngeal volumes measured using magnetic resonance imaging and a computer-controlled digitizing pad. Patients with more severe OSA had improvement after six weeks; however, they still demonstrated significant OSA. Patients with less severe OSA did not have significant change. We were unable to show a significant difference in any patient's awake pharyngeal volumes. We conclude that patients with OSA should be encouraged to wear their nasal CPAP machines regularly.\r"

Daytime hypertension was present in 92 (45 percent) of 206 male and female patients with OSA. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that only age and body mass index (BMI) were predictors of hypertension in this population. A subsample of 152 male patients with OSA was then compared to 904 men identified from a geographically and ethnically similar general population. When one controlled for age and BMI, the prevalence of hypertension in the two groups was the same except for those aged 25 to 44 years who were markedly obese (BMI greater than 31 kg/m2). In this group, 47 percent of the patients with OSA were hypertensive vs 26 percent of control subjects (p less than 0.05). Our data suggest that the high prevalence of hypertension in OSA is primarily related to age and the excess obesity seen in these patients. In morbidly obese young patients with OSA, factors directly related to OSA may also be contributing to the development of hypertension. With increasing age, other competitive risks may obscure any independent effect that OSA may exert.\r"

Although interest in lung transplantation is growing in both the medical and lay communities, a significant number of patients with endstage pulmonary disease were ineligible by our current criteria. As experience with these procedures is gained, criteria for selection may become less restrictive, and more patients may be candidates for transplantation.\r"

Previously, in acutely ill COPD patients, we showed similar improvements in pulmonary function after each drug (study 1). The responses of the same patients when stable are now reported (study 2). Patients received ipratropium bromide (54 micrograms) (n = 16) or metaproterenol sulfate (1.95 mg) (n = 14) via an MDI attached to a delivery device as in study 1. Ninety minutes after the first medication, patients received the second. Spirometry was measured at entry and at 30-min intervals following the first drug and at the same times after the second drug. Results were as follow: The groups did not differ in clinical characteristics. However, for both groups, there was significantly less airway obstruction at entry into study 2. In study 1, ipratropium resulted in significant improvement in FEV1 (0.62 +/- .08 to 0.88 +/- .11 L; mean increase 24 percent; p less than 0.05) with no further change after crossover. In study 2, ipratropium produced similar improvements in FEV1 by 90 minutes (0.94 +/- .09 to 1.3 +/- .09 L; mean increase 25 percent; p less than 0.05), with no further improvement after crossover. For metaproterenol, in study 1, the improvement in FEV1 was not significantly different than that for ipratropium (FEV1; 0.71 +/- .07 to 0.92 +/- 0.06 L; mean increase 18 percent; p less than 0.05), with no further improvement after crossover. In study 2, improvement with metaproterenol was significant and similar to study 1 (FEV1: 0.96 +/- .06 to 1.21 +/- .09 L; mean increase 18 percent; p less than 0.05). Thus, ipratropium and metaproterenol similarly improved pulmonary function in COPD patients when stable and during acute exacerbations.\r"

Twenty-one asthmatic children were evenly divided into three groups and each group performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled and crossover study on the effect of aerosolized BN52021, a PAF antagonist, on the bronchoconstriction induced by PAF, methacholine, or specific allergen, respectively. One group of healthy children was included for comparison. Total WBC, neutrophils, and eosinophils were counted before and after PAF challenge. The results showed the following: (1) six of seven asthmatics and one of seven normal subjects gave a positive bronchial provocation with PAF; (2) in asthmatics, prior inhalation of BN52021 could inhibit the bronchoconstriction induced by PAF (6/6) and allergen (3/7), but not by methacholine; and (3) 5 min after inhalation of PAF, there was a marked decrease of peripheral blood eosinophils and neutrophils that could be inhibited by prior inhalation of BN52021 in normal subjects but not in asthmatics. These findings support the idea that PAF may be involved in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and PAF antagonist may have a role in the prevention and treatment of this disease.\r"

  ".W": "The thoracocardiograph (TCG) displays cardiac oscillations transmitted to the external surface of the thorax through inductive plethysmographic transducers placed transversely around the thorax near or about the xiphoid process. Such signals, with the appearance of ventricular volume curves, were used to compute changes of stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) in normal subjects. Their values were compared with changes of SV and CO measured with the impedance cardiograph (IC). Increases of SV and CO were produced with subcutaneous terbutaline and there was excellent agreement between TCG and IC values, best from TCG transducers placed at the xiphoid process and 3 cm caudal to it, although TCG locations 6 cm caudad and 3 cm cephalad to the xiphoid were also satisfactory. Since the site 3 cm caudad to the xiphoid process is known to anatomically transect solely a segment of the left ventricle, it was designated the TCG-Reference location. Both TCG and IC derived SV were not altered during postural shifts about a horizontal axis. Neither TCG nor IC showed the expected large decreases of SV from supine posture to head-up tilt. With baseline TCG and IC measurements in 60 degrees head-up tilt. MAST suit application increased CO measured with TCG but not with IC. Neither TCG nor IC revealed alteration of CO with nasal CPAP up to 10 cm H2O despite a rise in functional residual capacity (FRC) level of 870 ml. This investigation indicates that TCG has promise as a near continuous, noninvasive monitor of SV and CO in normal subjects if postural axis is fixed and does not require highly trained personnel or labor-intensiveness for its operation.\r"

In 27 ambulatory cardiac patients and in 15 patients admitted to the hospital, we found that ECG records obtained with six bipolar CR leads were, in most respects, similar to records obtained previously in the same patients with six V leads. Records obtained with two abdominal-upper extremity leads, tested as possible alternatives to limb leads 2 and 3, were quite similar to records obtained with leads 2 and 3 in patients with an inferior wall infarction. Records obtained with leads CR7, CR8, and CR9 in a patient with a posterior wall infarction revealed a QS pattern that was not seen in the conventional 12-lead hospital record. In patients with anterolateral and inferior myocardial infarctions and in patients with unstable angina, the diagnostic patterns recorded with 11 bipolar leads described in this report were identical to patterns recorded with 12-lead ECGs. Although a larger number of observations, including patients with arrhythmias, would be required to reach a definitive conclusion, our results provide preliminary evidence that cardiac potentials may be adequately analyzed by using only two electrodes, using CR and abdominal leads, in succession. The technique described in this report, in which the reference electrode is attached to the right arm, and the exploring electrode is moved successively over nine preselected chest sites and over the umbilicus, can be completed in less than 3 minutes in a given patient, and provides records that are comparable to those obtained with the conventional 12-lead system.\r"

After intrapleural administration of ADR-MS for seven patients at an ADR dose of 40 mg, ADR was detected in the effusions for more than two weeks; however, ADR concentrations in serum were very small, consistent with minimal transpleural absorption of ADR. These results indicated the slow release of ADR into the pleural cavity. Furthermore, the amount of drained ADR was less than a few percent of the administered dose. In some cases, malignant cells in the effusion disappeared after the treatment. No complications related to the procedure occurred, and the patients developed no systemic symptoms. One patient died after four months, and the other six patients are alive after 21 to 31 months without reaccumulation of the effusion. The local administration of ADR-MS produces a localized high and systemic low concentration of ADR, which could potentially improve the patient's quality of life.\r"

The overall incidence of PPC was 23.2 percent (232/1,000). Multivariate analysis identified seven factors which were associated with PPC: ASA classification greater than 2, upper abdominal surgery, residual intraperitoneal sepsis, age greater than 59 years, BMI greater than 25, preoperative hospital stay greater than 4 days, and colorectal or gastroduodenal surgery (overall F score = 33.5, p less than 0.0001). The ASA classification was the most powerful indicator of risk in both the univariate and the multivariate analyses. The combination of ASA classification greater than 1 and age greater than 59 years identified 88 percent (205 of 232) of the patients who developed PPC. These findings provide clinicians and clinical investigators with a simple means of identifying patients who are at high risk of PPC after abdominal surgery.\r"

In this group, ultrafast 10-mm and 3-mm high-resolution CT scans were prospectively performed in 33 patients to determine if useful information was provided that either changed the patient's clinical management or added confidence to the clinical diagnosis. The 36 symptomatic episodes that occurred in 33 patients included fever in 20 episodes and fever combined with cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or rales in 16. Fourteen chest roentgenograms were interpreted as normal, and 22 were interpreted as demonstrating nonspecific changes; however, none of the roentgenograms was considered helpful in that they did not provide sufficient information for further management. In 2 of 14 episodes in patients with normal chest roentgenograms and in 9 of 22 episodes in patients with nonspecific chest roentgenograms, CT scanning resulted in a change in clinical management that included performing bronchoscopy, increasing or changing antibiotic coverage, starting white blood cell transfusions, requesting surgical biopsy, or a combination of these. In 1 of 14 episodes in patients with normal chest roentgenograms and in 8 of 22 episodes in patients with nonspecific roentgenograms, CT added confidence to the diagnosis. In the remaining 16 episodes, CT scans provided no additional information. We conclude that in many instances, noncontrast ultrafast chest CT scans can provide information that may either change a patient's clinical management or more clearly establish the extent of pulmonary disease.\r"

The primary tumor was divided histologically into three compartments: tumor area of type 1, papillary adenocarcinoma with thin stroma; tumor area of type 2, papillary adenocarcinoma with thickened fibrovascular stroma: tumor area of type 3; solid carcinoma with scant gland formation. The nuclear DNA content (NDC) was higher in type 2 than in type 1 tumor in terms of mean NDC and DNA histogram pattern (p less than 0.01). Metastatic tumors in distant organs often resembled the type 2 of primary tumors histologically and also in their DNA histogram patterns, and their mean NDC values were significantly correlated with each other (p less than 0.01). Metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes had a significantly lower mean NDC than those in distant organs (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that (1) type 2 tumors originate from type 1 tumors by malignant progression and metastasize hematogenously, and (2) hematogenous metastases are composed of tumor subclones different from those of lymphatic metastases.\r"

The swine farmers represented almost the complete work force from 13 Hutterite colonies and had worked in confinement buildings with more than 2,000 swine (3,270 +/- 1,221 swine) for at least four hours (6.6 +/- 1.8 hours) per day for more than two years (10.5 +/- 7.5 years). The control subjects were randomly selected from outdoor city workers from the city of Saskatoon and were matched for gender, age (+/- 2 years), and smoking status. Eleven swine farmers (55 percent) had chronic cough, compared with three (15 percent) of the control subjects (p less than 0.01). Eight (40 percent) of the swine farmers had symptoms of wheezing, compared with three (15 percent) of the control subjects (p less than 0.05). The FEV1 was significantly lower in swine farmers (97.2 +/- 11.5 percent predicted) than in control subjects (106.0 +/- 12.0 percent of predicted) (p less than 0.05). Airways responsiveness was measured by methacholine challenge with doubling concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 256 mg/ml. The provocation concentrations resulting in a reduction of 10 percent (PC10) and 20 percent (PC20) in FEV1 were lower in swine farmers than in control subjects (PC10, 77.2 +/- 78.8 mg/ml vs 180.8 +/- 96.5 mg/ml; p less than 0.01; and PC20, 154.5 +/- 99.9 mg/ml vs 229.6 +/- 66.8 mg/ml; p less than 0.05). Twelve swine farmers (60 percent) had PC20 of less than 256 mg/ml, compared with three (15 percent) of the control workers (p less than 0.01). Fewer swine farmers demonstrated atopy as measured by skin prick tests than did control workers (21 percent vs 56 percent; p less than 0.05). These findings suggested that occupational exposure in swine confinement buildings is associated with mild increases of nonspecific, nonatopic airways responsiveness in swine farmers.\r"

In the first series, PGE1 was given as a trial of therapy after fluid therapy to pulmonary wedge pressures greater than 15 mm Hg failed to correct satisfactorily circulatory and metabolic functions. There were two deaths in the placebo group and none in the PGE1 group. Previous studies indicated that PGE1 disaggregates platelets and reduces local vasoconstriction in pulmonary circulation; this study suggests that PGE1 improves tissue perfusion of systemic circulation.

Patients with severe hypoxemia who meet blood gas criteria defined by the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation trial (ECMO) of 1974 to 1977 have a reported survival of 11 percent. The reported survival has remained unchanged for 15 years despite numerous technologic advances. We prospectively studied ARDS patients who met ECMO blood gas criteria. One hundred seventy-eight ARDS patients were prospectively screened over a 30-month period. Fifty-one of these patients met ECMO blood gas criteria and 23 (45 percent) survived (p less than 0.001 vs ECMO trial). No obvious differences in etiology, APACHE II score, organ system failure, or the incidence of sepsis was found between survivors and nonsurvivors. We conclude that survival of ARDS patients who met ECMO blood gas criteria in our institution is higher than that previously reported from both other centers and our own hospital.\r"

In this study, we examined measurements of cardiac output, oxygen-derived variables, and blood lactate levels in 48 patients with documented septic shock. There were 27 survivors and 21 nonsurvivors from the shock episode. For all 174 observations, there was a significant linear relationship between Vo2 and Do2 (Vo2 = 79 + 0.17 x Do2, r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). There were no significant differences in Do2 between survivors and nonsurvivors at the onset of septic shock (mean +/- SD, 540 +/- 219 vs 484 +/- 222 ml/min.m2, NS) or in the final phase of septic shock (506 +/- 163 vs 443 +/- 187 ml/min.m2, NS). Also, no significant differences were found in Vo2 and oxygen extraction between survivors and nonsurvivors. However, survivors had significantly lower blood lactate levels both initially (5.1 +/- 2.7 vs 8.2 +/- 5.4 mmol/L, p less than 0.05) and in the final phase of septic shock (2.6 +/- 1.9 vs 7.7 +/- 5.6 mmol/L, p less than 0.001). Only the survivors had a significant decrease in blood lactate levels during the course of septic shock (p less than 0.001). We conclude that the oxygen-derived variables, Do2 and Vo2, cannot be used as prognostic indicators in human septic shock. In contrast, blood lactate levels are closely related to ultimate survival from septic shock. Furthermore, decreases in blood lactate levels during the course of septic shock could indicate a favorable outcome. Therefore, blood lactate levels can serve as a reliable clinical guide to therapy.\r"

Echocardiograms were performed, not routinely, but in response to specific indications including catheter malfunction, thrombocytopenia, persistent chylothorax, bacterial or fungal sepsis, and superior vena cava syndrome. Fifteen of 37 patients died, 13 of them during the hospitalization in which the thrombus was discovered. Thrombolytic agents and surgery were used to treat selected patients, with mixed results. Two of the 22 survivors have significant disability related to the thrombus or complications arising from it. We conclude that great vein and/or right atrial thrombosis is a common complication of central venous catheterization in small infants and children; moreover, the morbidity and mortality relating to this complication is substantial.\r"

A chest roentgenogram showed the chest tube to be overlying the heart and possibly compressing the right ventricle. An animal model was developed to replicate this clinical situation. Using a domestic goat model pulmonary artery, peripheral arterial catheters were inserted along with a right sided chest tube placed to suction. A second chest tube guided by a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope placed within its lumen was positioned between the right ventricle and the sternum of the animals. Thirteen paired measurements in three goats (average of 4.3 measurements per animal) of cardiac output, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure were made at baseline and after chest tube placement over the right ventricle. The data were analyzed using a paired t test statistic. Compared with baseline measurements, there was a significant decrease in cardiac output (p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.001) as well as an increase in heart rate (p = 0.0056) after placement of the chest tube across the right ventricle. We conclude that a misplaced chest tube compressing the right ventricle can impede cardiac output and lead to a low cardiac output state. Physicians inserting chest tubes in patients should be aware of this potential complication as it is easily treated by withdrawal of the chest tube.\r"

Use of these agents, however, is hampered by concerns regarding safety and efficacy. Numerous laboratory parameters have been evaluated for monitoring the risk of bleeding complications, with levels of fibrinogen (and percentage of decrease) and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) correlating to a variable extent with clinical bleeding. The bleeding time (BT) test has also been proposed as a potential predictor of bleeding during thrombolytic therapy. With respect to efficacy, the D-dimer fragment of FDPs, when corrected for soluble fibrin polymers, has been shown to correlate with clot lysis in venous thromboembolism but not MI. The BT also is being considered as a marker of lysis in patients with DVT. Given the increasing concomitant use of antiplatelet agents during thrombolytic therapy, the BT, as an in vivo test of hemostasis and platelet function, has potential utility as a noninvasive, adjunctive marker of thrombolytic efficacy.\r"

The message coming from the results in the more than 50,000 patients included in the five key trials is simple and clear: thrombolysis, of any type, is the cornerstone of acute treatment of MI, and it works well to produce a very favorable epidemiologic picture. In the GISSI-2 trial, the nationwide adoption of a package of recommended treatments centered on thrombolysis for the overall population of patients with an acute MI has produced a relevant modification of the natural history of the disease, reducing the in-hospital mortality by about 40% in few years (from 13% to 8.8%). In particular, in the great majority of cases (patients aged less than 70 years in Killip class I with a first acute MI), the mortality has gone down to 3%, making a further reduction very hard to obtain with new drugs or strategies. In this context, we will discuss the concept of the relevance for clinical practice of obtaining even greater patency rates with new thrombolytic agents (hopefully more efficient and safe) or with new combinations of traditional agents.\r"

The choice of which thrombolytic agent to use in such patients, either streptokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), is based on regional preferences. The standard dose of streptokinase is 1.5 million units over 60 min, and the dose of rt-PA that is commonly used is 100 mg over 3 h. Experiments in animals have demonstrated that rt-PA produces continuing thrombolysis after it is cleared from the circulation and that thrombolysis is both increased and accelerated and bleeding is reduced when rt-PA is administered over a short time period. Based on these studies, there have been a number of recent trials examining alternative dosage regimens for rt-PA (bolus, front-loaded, and accelerated) in patients with myocardial infarction. To date, there is no convincing evidence that such regimens are superior to the more traditional rt-PA regimen. Future randomized trials will determine whether attempts to optimize rt-PA regimens will result in more efficacious treatment regimens. Interest in the use of thrombolytic therapy for patients with acute pulmonary embolism has been rekindled. The traditional 12- to 24-h regimens of streptokinase and urokinase are not optimal because of their logistic complexity and associated hemorrhagic complications. Clinical studies have demonstrated that rt-PA, 100 mg over 2 h, is an effective thrombolytic agent in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. In a recent double-blind trial in patients with acute pulmonary embolism, rt-PA, 0.6 mg/kg infused over 2 min, improved pulmonary perfusion. This bolus regimen is attractive because it is simple to administer. Future studies will compare the relative efficacy and safety of these two rt-PA regimens in patients with acute pulmonary embolism.\r"

Acetylsalicylic acid markedly enhances the mortality reduction of thrombolytic therapy and should be used routinely. There is a strong theoretical rationale for the use of heparin, but evidence for its benefit exists primarily in small angiographic trials, and convincing clinical benefit has not yet been demonstrated. Early intravenous beta-blockers were shown in the prethrombolysis era to confer modest benefit, but extensive data on their adjuvant use with thrombolysis are available from only one trial. Intravenous nitrates were demonstrated to reduce mortality in the prethrombolysis era, and are soon to be evaluated in trials employing thrombolytic therapy. The calcium channel blockers, in spite of a variety of theoretical benefits, have proved to be of no value acutely, and in the subacute setting, only diltiazem appears to confer benefit in the subgroup of patients with non-O-wave infarction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are likely to be of value in survivors of acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, and benefits observed with acute use in experimental infarction are now being evaluated in clinical trials.\r"

Although thrombolytic therapy has revolutionized the treatment of MI, it has significant shortcomings: about 75% of patients with acute MI cannot be treated with thrombolytic agents, 25% of treated patients will have persistent occlusion of the infarct-related artery, 70% will have a residual stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, and 20% of treated patients will experience reocclusion. Cardiac catheterization identifies the coronary anatomy for mechanical revascularization and allows the unstable patient to receive special therapy, such as intra-aortic balloon pumping. Many large clinical studies have evaluated approaches to coronary angioplasty for acute MI. Deferred angioplasty has indisputable advantages over immediate routine angioplasty. Direct angioplasty without concomitant thrombolytic therapy has acceptable success and complication rates, so that it can be considered the treatment of choice for acute MI in centers with an angioplasty program if thrombolytic therapy is contraindicated. Patients at very low risk may not require cardiac catheterization routinely before discharge, since their good prognosis cannot be improved by invasive evaluation and intervention. Emergency surgical revascularization is indicated in a very small percentage of cases.\r"

One study compared recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) with heparin in the treatment of pulmonary embolism. This study also compared the efficacy of rtPA (1 mg/kg) given over 15 min (rtPA15) to the same total dose infused over 90 min. Compared with heparin, both rtPA regimens induced marked pulmonary thrombolysis. During drug infusion, the rate of thrombolysis was increased 2-fold with rtPA15. A 2nd canine study investigated the physiologic mechanism of the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure with rtPA. The pattern of hemodynamic improvement with rtPA indicated that pulmonary thrombolysis predominantly occurred in partially, rather than totally, obstructed vascular units. A 3rd canine study compared rtPA and high-dose urokinase (UK) in treatment of pulmonary embolism. Both rtPA regimens were superior to UK in inducing pulmonary thrombolysis and improving pulmonary hemodynamics. Most recently, the effects of flow dynamics on rtPA-induced pulmonary thrombolysis were investigated, and it was demonstrated that an increase in cardiac output markedly enhanced rtPA-induced pulmonary thrombolysis. Most likely, the increase in cardiac output increased thrombolysis by enhancing delivery of rtPA to thrombus in partially obstructed vascular units.\r"

The nature of the deep vein thrombus, whether it is obstructing or nonobstructing, can be determined with the additional use of color Doppler mapping, a technique that displays flowing blood as a color overlay to the 2-dimensional real-time ultrasound image. Serial noninvasive determinations of the extent of thrombus in the lower-extremity deep veins is now possible with this combined sonographic imaging approach. Monitoring of possible changes in the extent of the thrombus burden can now be undertaken in patients enrolled in trials assessing the efficacy of different thrombolytic regimens.\r"

  ".W": "During the past year, there have been 2 major advances in the management of pulmonary embolism (PE). First, the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) investigators published the results of their comparison of ventilation-perfusion lung scanning and pulmonary angiography. This multimillion-dollar trial sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute indicated that lung scanning is surprisingly insensitive to the diagnosis of PE. High-probability lung scanning detects fewer than half of the cases of PE that are found at pulmonary angiography. The PIOPED results force us to conclude that increased utilization of both ultrasonography of the deep leg veins and pulmonary angiography is warranted in order to detect the majority of cases of venous thromboembolism. Second, in June 1990, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for use in the treatment of acute PE. The dosing regimen is 100 mg of rt-PA as a continuous peripheral intravenous infusion administered over 2 h. The convenience, rapid effect, and relative safety of this therapeutic approach may result in increased use of thrombolysis for management of PE.\r"

  ".W": "The modern treatment of cardiopulmonary disease is increasingly predicated on the goal of dissolving the offending clot to establish vascular patency as rapidly as possible and then preventing rethrombosis. The availability of thrombolytic agents has made this therapeutic approach possible and the adjunctive use of heparin, coumarin, and aspirin has increased the efficacy of lytic drugs. The administration of any of these medications is associated with inherent risks, which are enhanced when they are used concomitantly. An understanding of coagulation and an appreciation of the pathophysiologic processes of the thrombotic events occurring in cardiopulmonary disease states are critical to the formulation of innovative therapeutic regimens that maximize efficacy and safety. Furthermore, knowledge of the comparative pharmacology of the various thrombolytic agents is useful in explaining the benefits and complications observed in clinical trials.\r"

Both GnRH- and naloxone-induced LH responses were similar in group I diabetics and normal controls, whereas they were significantly lower in group II than in group I diabetics or normal controls. Positive correlations were found between LH responses to GnRH and naloxone, whereas negative correlations were observed between maximal LH peaks in response to GnRH or naloxone and duration of diabetes. These data indicate that a hypothalamic pituitary disorder affects LH secretion with time after the onset of IDDM.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: to determine the 11-deoxycortisol (S) response and incidence of 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency in hyperandrogenism. DESIGN: Hyperandrogenic women prospectively and consecutively underwent acute adrenal stimulation studies. SETTING: Tertiary institution. PATIENTS: Two hundred sixty women complaining of hirsutism and/or hyperandrogenic oligomenorrhea were studied, excluding five unrelated families (1.9% of total) suffering from 21-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. Forty-one healthy premenopausal eumenorrheic women served as controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Only two unrelated women (0.8%) had a poststimulation or net increment S level value greater than or equal to threefold the upper 95th percentile of controls and were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. One hundred nine (42%) of hyperandrogenic women had at least one S value above the 95th percentile of controls. These women also demonstrated higher basal (F0) and stimulated cortisol levels, but a similar increment compared with controls. RESULTS: Patients with high S measures had higher testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androstenedione levels, but similar luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratios, than hyperandrogenic cohorts with no abnormal S measures. Basal values of S (S0), F0, or S0/F0 were not useful to predict an abnormal S response to stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Although adrenocortical hyperactivity was present in 42% of our hyperandrogenic patients, only 0.8% were presumed to suffer from 11 beta-hydroxylase deficient late-onset adrenal hyperplasia. A systemic search for this deficiency in hyperandrogenism is probably unwarranted.\r"

The acne and seborrhea as well as hirsutism showed a significant improvement in all subjects studied. The plasma testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decrease from 1.5 +/- 1.3 ng/mL and 6.9 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL to 0.5 +/- 0.03 ng/mL and 2.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/mL, respectively. Similar values were observed in subjects with idiopathic hirsutism during the treatment. The metabolic parameters, as well as the plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, appeared unaffected by the therapy. Furthermore, the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion was strongly inhibited from the first cycle of treatment. In conclusion, considering the good clinical results and the avoidance of any hepatic effect, this association should be taken into account in the treatment of hirsutism, especially in case of oral estrogen intolerance.\r"

On the day of diagnosis, methotrexate (MTX) (1 mg/kg) or sulprostone (500 micrograms) were injected into the gestational sac under transvaginal sonographic control. The systemic component consisted of an intramuscular injection of MTX (1 mg/kg) 3, 5, and 7 days after local injection or of sulprostone (500 micrograms) on the 1st 2 postlocal injection days. Methotrexate therapy was successful in 8 of 12 patients and sulprostone therapy in 6 of 9. Laparoscopy was then performed on the 7 unsuccessful patients: 3 of them had pain and hemoperitoneum and 4 of them had rising human choriogonadotropin (hCG) levels. One stomatitis after MTX and one cramping abdominal pain were observed. Thirteen of 14 successfully treated patients had initial hCG levels less than 5,000 mIU/mL. At subsequent hysterosalpinography, 13 of 14 patients had normal tubal configuration and patency. Three of 10 patients who desired another pregnancy had already achieved a normal intrauterine pregnancy. These results suggest that MTX and sulprostone were equally effective, and medical approach for the unruptured ectopic pregnancy may be restricted to patients with hCG less than 5,000 mIU/mL.\r"

Naloxone at a dosage of 2 mg/h was infused intravenously for 4 hours, and serum was obtained every 15 minutes for 6 hours. With increasing doses, rises of serum E2 and estrone were elicited across the range seen in premenopausal women. A stepwise reduction of luteinizing hormone (LH) levels was observed with increasing dosages of E2. The naloxone infusions resulted in significant increases of LH when E2 was being given but not during the pretreatment studies. These data indicate E2, in physiological concentrations, induces hypothalamic opioid activity.\r"

The incidence, area, and volume of subtle lesions decreased with age, whereas for typical lesions these parameters and the depth of infiltration increased with age. Deeply infiltrating endometriosis was strongly associated with pelvic pain, women with pain having larger and deeper lesions. Because deep endometriosis has little emphasis in the revised American Fertility Society classification and after analyzing the diagnoses made in each class, considerations for a simplifying revision with inclusion of deep lesions are suggested. In conclusion, suggestive evidence is presented to support the concept that endometriosis is a progressive disorder, and it is demonstrated that deep endometriosis is strongly associated with pelvic pain.\r"

Eighteen healthy ovulatory volunteers with proven fertility were evaluated for at least one complete menstrual cycle in the follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases. Multiple cycles were studied in 10 volunteers. The results showed that the contractions increase in frequency, amplitude, and percentage toward the fundus throughout the follicular and periovulatory phases. The pattern is essentially reversed in the luteal phase. There is reproducibility of these patterns from cycle to cycle. We conclude that there is a definite identifiable pattern of subendometrial myometrial contractility that varies with the phases of the normal menstrual cycle and recurs in a similar fashion from cycle to cycle.\r"

Six women, ages 27 to 36 with absent or nonfunctioning ovaries, received transdermal E2 and vaginal P after a 28-day replacement regimen duplicating E2 and P levels seen in the menstrual cycle. Vascular resistance of uterine arteries was evaluated before treatment (baseline), on days 13 to 14 and on days 26 to 27, using transvaginal pulsed Doppler combined with real-time imaging. Doppler waveforms were analyzed by the pulsatility index (PI). Baseline evaluation showed narrow systolic Doppler flow waves with a PI of 5.2 +/- 0.4, mean +/- SEM. On cycle day 13, Doppler waveforms showed a marked broadening with uninterrupted diastolic flow indicative of a profound decrease in vascular resistance. This was reflected by a significant decrease in PI to 1.3 +/- 0.3, mean +/- SEM. Doppler measurements made on days 26 to 27 showed no significant change. Our results indicate that at physiological levels, E2 affects vascular resistance of uterine arteries. This represents a new parameter of estrogen action, readily measurable by a noninvasive technique that, in the future, may help for assessing the efficacy of various estrogenic treatments.\r"

There were no significant differences in these cycles between the two groups in peak estradiol level achieved, the number of eggs retrieved, fertilization rate, or implantation rate. The incidence of spontaneous abortion was higher in smokers (42.1%) than in nonsmokers (18.9%). Consequently, the delivery rate per cycle of IVF was significantly lower in the smoking group (11 of 124, 9.6%) than in the nonsmokers (40 of 236, 17.0%). There was no effect when only the husband was a smoker. From these data, smoking appears to significantly reduce the chances of successful pregnancy after IVF treatment.\r"

It is concluded that while day 5 ET may well be important in terms of embryo biopsy for the preimplantation diagnosis of genetic disease, day 2 ET remains preferable for therapeutic IVF. Although these data would not support the introduction of day 5 ET into routine therapeutic IVF, delayed ET should be considered as an alternative approach to preimplantation diagnosis. Indeed, because the latter will generally involve the treatment of normal, fertile couples, it might be predicted that embryo survival rates, and thus the rate of pregnancy after day 5 ET, would be better than those presented here.\r"

These compounds, termed glycoxidation products, accumulate in tissue collagen with age and at an accelerated rate in diabetes. Although glycoxidation products are present in only trace concentrations, even in diabetic collagen, studies on glycation and oxidation of model proteins in vitro suggest that these products are biomarkers of more extensive underlying glycative and oxidative damage to the protein. Possible sources of oxidative stress and damage to proteins in diabetes include free radicals generated by autoxidation reactions of sugars and sugar adducts to protein and by autoxidation of unsaturated lipids in plasma and membrane proteins. The oxidative stress may be amplified by a continuing cycle of metabolic stress, tissue damage, and cell death, leading to increased free radical production and compromised free radical inhibitory and scavenger systems, which further exacerbate the oxidative stress. Structural characterization of the cross-links and other products accumulating in collagen in diabetes is needed to gain a better understanding of the relationship between oxidative stress and the development of complications in diabetes. Such studies may lead to therapeutic approaches for limiting the damage from glycation and oxidation reactions and for complementing existing therapy for treatment of the complications of diabetes.\r"

Islet amyloid represents the most common pathological lesion occurring in the islets of NIDDM subjects. The use of both biochemistry and molecular biology has lead to the identification of the major protein component of human islet amyloid and elucidation of the structure of its precursor. This protein, termed islet amyloid polypeptide, is related to two neuropeptides, calcitonin gene-related peptides 1 and 2, and represents a new beta-cell secretory product whose normal physiological function remains to be determined. The use of molecular biology has also led to a better understanding of the molecular defects contributing to insulin resistance. Characterization of the insulin-receptor gene in patients with extreme forms of insulin resistance has resulted in the identification of mutations that impair its function and lead to tissue resistance to the action of insulin. Molecular biological approaches have also led to a better understanding of the regulation of glucose transport. They have revealed that there is a family of structurally related proteins encoded by distinct genes and expressed in a tissue-specific manner that are responsible for the transport of glucose across the plasma membrane. Moreover, they have shown that specific depletion of the glucose-transporter isoform that mediates insulin-stimulated glucose transport is responsible for decreased transport activity in adipose tissue in insulin-resistant states.\r"

Radiolabeled insulin was perfused into rat liver via the portal vein, and insulin-containing endosomes were prepared by differential centrifugation. The endosomes were incubated in various buffers, and hormone degradation was monitored by Sephadex G-50 chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Endosomes incubated in simple imidazole or HEPES (pH 7.4) buffers rapidly degraded insulin to intermediate- and then to low-molecular-weight products that were lost from the vesicles. HPLC analysis of insulin-sized material showed the products to be the same as those produced by intact cells. The endosomes did not acidify in these buffers (as assessed by the acridine orange method), and ATP had no effects. When the endosomes were incubated in a chloride-containing buffer, degradation was greatly inhibited, and acidification did not occur. Both insulin degradation and acidification were activated when Mg-ATP was added to this buffer system. HPLC analysis of the products generated in this system revealed not only typical cellular products but additional less hydrophobic products. Western-blot analysis of endosomal protein with anti-insulin-degrading enzyme antibody showed this enzyme to be present. In conclusion, isolated endosomes rapidly and completely degrade insulin through products that are typical of cellular degradation without requiring acidification. Chloride-containing buffers inhibit endosomal degradation, which is reversed by Mg-ATP, but this system does not mimic cellular degradation. At least one of the enzymes responsible for insulin degradation is insulin-degrading enzyme.\r"

IGF-I was infused at 0.65 or 1.96 nmol.kg-1.min-1 and insulin at 22 or 29 pmol.kg-1.min-1 in combination with [3-3H]glucose while euglycemia was maintained by a variable glucose infusion.

Whole-body glycolytic rate (3H2O generation) and muscle glycogen synthetic rate were identical during insulin and IGF-I infusions.

Measurements of HIT cell viability and insulin secretion were determined to 1) ascertain whether activated MCs can alter beta-cell viability in the absence of exogenously provided cytokines, 2) examine this response over a range of MC-HIT cell ratios, and 3) identify mechanisms responsible for altered insulin release consequent to MC-induced HIT cell damage. HIT cell viability was markedly decreased by activated MCs during an 8-h coincubation. HIT cell lysis could be attributed to activated natural killer cells, and lysis did not occur in the presence of activated T-lymphocyte clones. Activated MCs caused a marked early increase in insulin release from HIT cells (increase at 2 h: 7.75 +/- 0.16 nM for activated MCs, 2.66 +/- 0.09 nM for control; P less than 0.001). Insulin levels by the 8th h of the coincubation were significantly lower than the 2-h peak (4.33 +/- 0.13 vs. 7.75 +/- 0.16 nM, P less than 0.001). These changes in insulin were dependent on the ratio of activated MCs to HIT cells with the effects clearly evident at an activated MC-HIT cell ratio of greater than or equal to 10:1. Pretreatment of activated MCs and HIT cells with prostaglandin-synthesis inhibitors did not prevent the cytotoxic effects of activated MCs on HIT cells. Somatostatin did not inhibit the early exaggerated insulin release, suggesting that these increased insulin levels represented leakage of insulin from damaged HIT cells rather than functional insulin secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study looked at the effects of maternal diabetes on embryonic growth. Female Quakenbush mice were made diabetic (plasma glucose levels greater than 20 mM) by injection of 190 mg/kg i.p. STZ and were superovulated by standard methods. The blastocysts collected on day 4 from diabetic mothers had 8.5% fewer cells and a 35% lower protein synthetic rate than control embryos. Their cellular protein synthetic rate was 19% less than that in controls. Morulae from diabetic mothers also displayed a reduced protein synthetic rate, but this reduction was not seen in the two-cell embryo. Furthermore, blastocysts cultured in vitro from two-cell embryos from diabetic and control mothers displayed similar protein synthetic rates. This infers that the two-cell embryos from diabetic mothers are normal, and the retardation seen in later development in vivo occurs after the two-cell stage while the embryo is still free in the oviductal and uterine environment. Treatment of the diabetic mice with ultralente insulin every 12 h raised the protein synthetic rate of those blastocysts toward control levels, whereas treatment with lente insulin every 8 h recovered the embryo to the same rate as the control embryos. Because insulin has been shown to be mitogenic and stimulates protein synthesis of morulae and blastocysts in vitro, the absence of insulin in the diabetic mothers may be the cause of the retardation observed in their preimplantation embryos.\r"

We tested the role of increased polyol-pathway activity in the early glomerular hemodynamic abnormalities in experimental diabetes in rats with dietary myo-inositol supplementation or the administration of sorbinil, an aldose reductase inhibitor. Each maneuver prevented the glomerular hyperfiltration of early streptozocin-induced diabetes and reversed the hyperfiltration of established diabetes of 10 days' duration. We also found that the abnormal response to captopril in diabetic rats was improved by dietary myo-inositol supplementation or sorbinil administration. Although nonhypotensive doses of captopril lowered glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in diabetic rats on a 0.01% myo-inositol diet, GFR increased substantially after captopril infusion in diabetic rats treated with sorbinil or myo-inositol supplementation. These data suggest that normalization of tissue myo-inositol metabolism restores normal responsiveness to angiotensin II; this may contribute to the reduction in GFR with the two experimental maneuvers. We also tested the interaction between polyol-pathway activation and high dietary protein intake. Aldose reductase inhibition and dietary myo-inositol supplementation had no effect on the component of increased GFR due to 50% dietary protein intake but specifically inhibited the hyperfiltration attributable to diabetes. These results suggest that hyperglycemia acts through increased polyol-pathway activity and its effects on tissue myo-inositol metabolism to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of the glomerular hyperfiltration characteristic of early diabetes.\r"

Freshly isolated adipocytes from obese nondiabetic and obese NIDDM subjects had decreased insulin sensitivity and responsiveness for glucose-transport stimulation compared with control subjects, with more pronounced changes associated with obese NIDDM patients. The relative abundance of muscle/fat glucose-transporter isoform in the three groups of subjects was determined by Western-blot analysis of detergent-soluble adipose tissue extracts with monoclonal antibody 1F8. Obesity per se had no effect on adipose tissue muscle/fat glucose-transporter isoform (3150 +/- 660 vs. 4495 +/- 410 counts/min [cpm]/mg protein). Furthermore, decreased levels of muscle/fat isoform in adipose tissue of NIDDM patients were also reflected in isolated adipocytes. Our results demonstrate that insulin resistance in isolated adipocytes of NIDDM patients could at least partly be due to a significant depletion of adipose tissue muscle/fat glucose-transporter isoform.\r"

  ".W": "Genetic susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is associated with the HLA-DR3 and DR4 haplotypes. The HLA-DR2 haplotype is negatively associated with IDDM, an association that has been interpreted as dominant protection. Here, we describe the molecular analysis of the HLA class II genes in an unusual family with three HLA-DR1/2 siblings, all of whom have IDDM. With polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis to characterize the class II alleles, we identified a novel DQB1 allele on the DR1 haplotype and an unusual DQB1 allele on the DR2 haplotype. However, the DRB1 alleles on these DR1 and DR2 haplotypes are the conventional alleles (*0101 and *1501, respectively). These results suggest that it is the conventional DQB1 allele (*0602) not the DRB1 allele (*1501) on the protective DR2 haplotype that confers protection in the general population and, furthermore, that these unusual DQB1 alleles may confer susceptibility to IDDM in this family. The unusual DQB1 allele on this DR2 haplotype encodes Asp at position 57, indicating that it is the allele DQB1*0602 and not simply the presence of this residue that is responsible for the protective effect.\r"

Insertion of rods containing only MALS or RALS had no effect on the survival time of the rat islet xenografts. In contrast, the insertion of both MALS and RALS rods with the graft produced a marked prolongation of islet xenograft survival (mean survival time greater than 55.5 +/- 10.9 days) compared with controls (14.7 +/- 2.5 days). One recipient was still normoglycemic at 100 days, and removal of the graft returned the animal to a diabetic state. The islet graft had a normal degree of beta-granulation, and a slight fibrotic reaction was present around the rods. The effect of the rods in prolonging survival of the xenografts resulted from a local slow release of MALS and RALS, because implantation of the MALS and RALS rods in the right kidney and the islets in the left kidney had no effect on prolonging islet xenograft survival. These findings indicate that local immunosuppression produced marked prolongation of rat islet xenograft survival in mice. This raises the possibility of using polymer rods for the local slow release of monoclonal antibodies to lymphokines and other agents for prevention of rejection of islet allografts and xenografts and to determine the effect of lymphokines in vivo on islet function.\r"

  ".U": "91184566\r", 
  ".W": "In early 1988, a colony of GK rats was started in Paris with progenitors issued from F35 of the original colony reported by Goto and Kakisaki. When studied longitudinally up to 8 mo, GK rats showed as early as 1 mo (weaning) significantly higher basal plasma glucose (9 mM) and insulin levels (doubled), altered glucose tolerance (intravenous glucose), and a very poor insulin secretory response to glucose in vivo compared with Wistar controls. Males and females were similarly affected. Studies of in vitro pancreatic function were carried out with the isolated perfused pancreas preparation. Compared with nondiabetic Wistar rats, GK rats at 2 mo showed a significantly increased basal insulin release, no insulin response to 16 mM glucose, and hyperresponse to 19 mM arginine. Pancreatic insulin stores were only 50% of that in Wistar rats. Perfusion of GK pancreases for 50 or 90 min with buffer containing no glucose partially improved the insulin response to 16 mM glucose and markedly diminished the response to 19 mM arginine, whereas the responses by Wistar pancreases were unchanged. These findings are similar to those reported in rats with non-insulin-dependent diabetes induced by neonatal streptozocin administration and support the concept that chronic elevation in plasma glucose may be responsible, at least in part, for the beta-cell desensitization to glucose in this model. The GK rat seems to be a valuable model for identifying the etiology of beta-cell desensitization to glucose.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of oral vanadyl sulfate administration for 9-12 days on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in the basal state and on glucose dynamics during submaximal hyperinsulinemic clamps were investigated in nondiabetic and streptozocin-induced diabetic rats. Decreases in growth rate and water and food consumption were the only significant alterations noted in control animals receiving vanadyl. Administration of vanadyl to diabetic rats resulted in weight loss; a significant decrease in plasma glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels; and decreases in food and water intake, without a concomitant change in plasma insulin concentrations. Vanadyl treatment did not modify either peripheral glucose utilization or hepatic glucose production in control rats during submaximal insulin clamps. In contrast, vanadyl therapy increased insulin-induced glucose utilization significantly and had a small but nonsignificant effect on insulin-mediated suppression of glucose production in diabetic rats. The tyrosine kinase activity of liver- and muscle-derived insulin receptors from diabetic rats that underwent clamp study, which reflected the in vivo phosphorylation state of insulin receptor, was not altered by vanadyl treatment. In conclusion, these results show that augmentation of peripheral glucose utilization is the major determinant of the antidiabetic action of vanadyl and support the notion that the action of vanadyl is independent of insulin-receptor kinase activity.\r"

The diabetic patients were studied in the absence of amino acids, and both groups were studied during infusion of a mixed-amino acid solution (AA). In the diabetic patients, insulin alone and combined with additional AA reduced leg tissue phenylalanine release by 42 and 41%, respectively (both P less than 0.05), but uptake was unchanged. Leg tissue leucine oxidation was unchanged by insulin alone but was increased (P = 0.012) fourfold during insulin infusion with additional AA. In the nondiabetic subjects, insulin with AA infusion increased leg tissue phenylalanine uptake (45.7 +/- 7.5 to 73.1 +/- 7.3 nmol.min-1.100 g-1, P less than 0.01). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in the diabetic patients (1.60 +/- 0.28 mumol.min-1.100 g-1, P = 0.04). These results suggest that, in IDDM patients, 1) infusion of insulin fails to stimulate muscle protein synthesis even when combined with a substantially increased provision of AA, and 2) compared with nondiabetic subjects, muscle protein synthesis as well as glucose uptake exhibit blunted responses to insulin.\r"

We compared fasting and glucose-stimulated insulin and C-peptide levels in a community-based sample of 464 Hispanic and 676 non-Hispanic white adult residents of the San Luis Valley of Colorado. All subjects had normal glucose tolerance as confirmed by oral glucose tolerance testing interpreted with World Health Organization criteria. Mean fasting and 1- and 2-h post-glucose load insulin levels were significantly higher in Hispanics versus non-Hispanic whites (fasting 0.08 vs. 0.07 nM, P = 0.0026; 1 h 0.52 vs. 0.47 nM, P = 0.0129; 2 h 0.36 vs. 0.27 nM, P less than 0.0001), even after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, waist-hip ratio, family history of diabetes mellitus, concurrent plasma glucose level, and fasting insulin level. Mean fasting and 1- and 2-h glucose-stimulated C-peptide levels in Hispanics also significantly exceeded those in non-Hispanic whites (fasting 0.58 vs. 0.54 nM, P = 0.0119; 1 h 2.72 vs. 2.46 nM, P less than 0.0001; 2 h 2.25 vs. 1.97 nM, P less than 0.0001). The C-peptide-insulin molar ratio was greater in non-Hispanic whites than Hispanics at all times measured. These findings confirm that Hispanics with normal glucose tolerance are hyperinsulinemic and that increased insulin secretion is at least partly responsible for this phenomenon. The lower levels of C-peptide compared with insulin in Hispanics suggest that the hyperinsulinemia seen in this ethnic group may be due in part to decreased hepatic insulin extraction.\r"

In 498 subjects, blood glucose was measured 2 h after the glucose load on both occasions, and in 175 subjects, fasting blood glucose measurement was also repeated. Of the 498 subjects, 245 had normal glucose tolerance in the first test and were selected at random for further testing; 223 subjects had impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and 30 had diabetic values. Diabetes and IGT were diagnosed on the basis of the 2-h blood glucose values. In the second test, 241 (98.4%) of the 245 subjects with normal tolerance continued in this category and 4 (1.6%) showed IGT. Of the 223 with IGT in the first test, 171 (76.2%) reverted to normal on the second test, 7 (3.1%) had diabetic values, and 45 (20.2%) persisted with IGT. Of the 30 subjects diagnosed as diabetic in the first test, 8 (26.7%) remained with diabetic values, 11 (36.7%) had IGT, and 11 (36.7%) were normal. Based on the second test, the population-prevalence rates of diabetes and IGT would have been 0.5 and 3.3% vs. 1 and 7.6% based on the first test. There was a significant downward trend in the mean 2-h blood glucose values in all three diagnostic groups. Regression toward the mean could not account for the downward shift in blood glucose values observed on retesting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Acute bronchospasm is best treated with inhaled sympathomimetic agents, but the nonbronchodilator effects of theophylline offer therapeutic benefits for the patient with non-reversible disease. When properly monitored by serum level determinations, theophylline may be used as an adjunct to aerosol therapy and corticosteroids in asthma. However, the patient with COPD may benefit the most from an empiric trial of the drug, using lower doses than were commonly employed in the past.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the incidence, determinants and significance of delayed clearance of serum HBsAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection, a prospective follow-up study was conducted in two consecutive groups of patients. Group I consisted of 984 patients (859 men and 125 women) with biopsy-proven chronic type B hepatitis, whereas group II consisted of 1,598 asymptomatic chronic carriers (998 men and 600 women) with normal serum aminotransferase activity. During a mean follow-up period of 4.0 +/- 2.3 yr, 19 patients (1.9%) of group I cleared HBsAg from their serum, whereas 35 patients (2.2%) in group II did so in a mean follow-up period of 2.7 +/- 1.4 yr. The annual incidence of delayed serum HBsAg clearance was 0.5% in group I and 0.8% in group II (p less than 0.02). The cumulative probability of HBsAg clearance was also higher in group II than in group I (p less than 0.007). Antibodies to HBsAg developed in 9 patients (47.4%) with chronic hepatitis and in 11 (31.4%) asymptomatic carriers who cleared serum HBsAg. Those who were HBeAg negative and those older than 40 at entry and those who exhibited cirrhosis during follow-up had a higher incidence of delayed HBsAg clearance. Gender, initial histological changes and hepatitis delta virus infection did not influence the occurrence of HBsAg clearance. Serum HBV DNA was not detectable by slot-blot hybridization but was still detectable by polymerase chain reaction in serum specimens collected within 1 yr of HBsAg clearance. Liver biopsy performed later in 10 patients showed no significant hepatitis activity or tissue HBV DNA, HBsAg or HBcAg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Group I (n = 31) had detectable HBsAg and HBeAg, group II (n = 46) had HBsAg but not HBeAg and group III (n = 21) consisted of patients who were once chronic hepatitis B virus carriers but had lost HBsAg during follow-up. Group I patients usually had significant liver disease (raised serum aminotransferases), had higher titers of HBsAg and had been infected with hepatitis B virus for a shorter period than patients in the other two groups. All patients in group I had hepatitis B virus DNA detectable by polymerase chain reaction and 94% had sufficient hepatitis B virus DNA present for detection by dot-blot hybridization. Group II patients had lower mean serum aminotransferase activities and titers of HBsAg than those in group I. Serum hepatitis B virus DNA was detectable by polymerase chain reaction in 78% but in only 30% of group II patients by dot-blot hybridization. Group II patients who did not have hepatitis B virus DNA detectable by polymerase chain reaction had mean serum aminotransferase levels within the normal range and had a younger mean age than those with hepatitis B virus DNA.

With HBxAg-specific synthetic polypeptides, several T-cell epitopes were identified. Most were located in the carboxyterminal half of the HBxAg protein. Five T-cell clones specific for a T-cell epitope located at the carboxyterminal region of HBxAg were established and found to belong to the CD2/CD4-positive, CD8-negative subtype.

Its mRNA expression is developmentally regulated in human liver, the reexpression of insulin-like growth factor II fetal transcripts being often observed in primary liver cancer. Insulin-like growth factor II and alpha-fetoprotein mRNAs were studied in 16 human primary liver cancers, most of which were highly differentiated. Hepatitis B virus transcripts were also analyzed in the tumors from hepatitis B virus chronic carriers. alpha-Fetoprotein mRNA was detected in only four tumors and in one nontumorous cirrhotic tissue; all these samples also displayed insulin-like growth factor II fetal transcripts. Furthermore, fetal insulin-like growth factor II mRNAs were observed in five tumors and six nontumorous cirrhotic areas not expressing alpha-fetoprotein mRNA. The presence of hepatitis B virus RNA was only observed in tissues not expressing alpha-fetoprotein or fetal insulin-like growth factor II mRNA. In conclusion, fetal insulin-like growth factor II transcripts are more frequently observed than alpha-fetoprotein mRNA in highly differentiated liver cancers and in surrounding cirrhotic areas. The reexpression of fetal insulin-like growth factor II transcripts might then be a marker of early steps of liver cell transformation.\r"

The incidence rates (per million person-years) were for men and women, respectively: infectious hepatitis, 109 and 71; toxic hepatitis, 19 and 22; chronic hepatitis, 27 and 29; alcoholic cirrhosis, 190 and 85; nonalcoholic nonbiliary cirrhosis, 110 and 82; primary biliary cirrhosis, 4 and 14. The pattern of the age-specific incidence rates was similar in men and women in infectious hepatitis, alcoholic cirrhosis, nonalcoholic nonbiliary cirrhosis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Toxic and chronic hepatitis had a higher incidence in women than in men only in older age groups. The incidence of idiopathic hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, secondary biliary cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis and Budd-Chiari's syndrome were less than four in both sexes.\r"

In 10 patients with extrahepatic cholestasis caused by carcinoma of the head of the pancreas we investigated excretion rates and profiles of urinary bile acid glucosides. Urinary bile acid glucosides and, for comparison, bile acid glucuronides were extracted and characterized according to established methods. In controls total urinary bile acid glucoside excretion was 0.22 +/- 0.03 mumol/24 hr (mean +/- S.E.M.)-in the range of bile acid glucuronide excretion (0.41 +/- 0.06 mumol/24 hr; mean +/- S.E.M.). A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-characterized trihydroxy bile acid glucoside of still-unknown hydroxyl positions accounted for 65% of total urinary bile acid glucosides. In extrahepatic cholestasis total urinary bile acid glucoside excretion was 0.52 +/- 0.13 mumol/24 hr (mean +/- SEM), yet significantly lower than bile acid glucuronide excretion (1.53 +/- 0.13 mumol/24 hr; mean +/- SEM; p less than 0.001). In cholestasis the primary bile acid derivatives cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid glucosides amounted to 90%, whereas the trihydroxy bile acid glucoside had decreased to 5% of total bile acid glucoside excretion, indicating its alteration during enterohepatic circulation. The data establish the composition and quantity of urinary bile acid glucosides in healthy controls and cholestasis and constitute a quantitative comparison with another glycosidic conjugation reaction, bile acid glucuronidation.\r"

Polymeric IgA induces tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that cross-linking of Fc alpha receptors on human monocytes induces the messenger RNA accumulation and the secretion of the cytotoxic and immunoregulatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Furthermore, it is shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells is synergistically enhanced in the presence of solid phase monomeric IgA but not in the presence of either soluble monomeric or polymeric IgA. Although increased lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion is observed at baseline in alcoholic cirrhotic patients, this synergism is also expressed in this group of patients. These observations could be of pathophysiological relevance in alcoholic cirrhosis because monomeric IgA deposits along the liver sinusoids and increased serum levels of polymeric IgA are common even in the early stages of this disease.\r"

We used the same technique to study the lymphocyte population in human liver obtained ex vivo after partial hepatectomy for benign or malignant tumors and compared it with peripheral and portal blood lymphocyte populations. Percentages of lymphocyte surface phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry. The lymphocyte population obtained from human liver is mainly made up of CD56+ (35%) cells. This percentage is three times greater than that found in peripheral and portal blood. Two-color flow cytometry analysis showed that within the CD56+ liver cell population, at least three distinct subsets could be found: (a) CD3+/CD56+/CD16-; (b) CD3-/CD56+/CD16-; and (c) CD3-/CD56+/CD16+. Although these subsets were also present in peripheral and portal blood, the percentage distribution was completely different because most CD56+ cells in peripheral and portal blood belonged to the CD3-/CD56+/CD16+ subset. These results show the existence of a heterogeneous natural killer cell population in human livers with tumors. The functional significance of this heterogeneity still needs to be explained.\r"

The log PD20 (dose of agonist required to raise blood pressure by 20 mm Hg) for norepinephrine was 4.78 +/- 0.36 (mean +/- S.D.) in patients with severe cirrhosis and 4.36 +/- 0.37 in controls, p less than 0.01.

Cardiovascular responses to selective sympathetic agonists were measured in 10 other cirrhotic patients (all Child-Pugh grades B or C) and in 10 healthy controls. Log PD20s for phenylephrine, an alpha-1 adrenoceptor agonist, and for alphamethylnorepinephrine; an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, were increased in cirrhosis (phenylephrine = 5.35 +/- 0.49 vs. 4.95 +/- 0.35, p less than 0.05; alphamethylnorepinephrine = 4.05 +/- 0.26 vs. 3.44 +/- 0.55, p less than 0.001). In contrast, log CD20 (dose of agonist required to raise the heart rate by 20 beats/min) for isoproterenol, a beta-adrenoceptor agonist, was similar in cirrhotic patients and controls (2.81 +/- 0.38 vs. 2.94 +/- 0.45, p = 0.49). These studies demonstrate that pressor reactivity to both sympathetic and nonsympathetic agonists is impaired in severe cirrhosis, that the impaired sympathetic responses are not caused by generalized sympathetic desensitization and that the site common to the four agonists with impaired responses is the peripheral vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Two patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, and drainage was carried out in another. The clinical courses went rapidly downhill. The liver was cirrhotic in two patients. The interior of the main mass was almost totally necrotic in four cases. Histologically, the malignant cells in the main portion resembled sarcoma, but in some areas cells appeared epithelial with eosinophilic cytoplasm and were in a trabecular arrangement, except for one case not subjected to autopsy in which histological study was inadequate because of extensive necrosis. It seems that these neoplasms were very poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas rather than combinations of sarcoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients, therefore, may represent a distinct clinicopathological type of hepatocellular carcinoma that is very rare in Japan but perhaps more common in South Africa, where similar cases have been clinically described in larger numbers.\r"

The principal reasons for this are disease heterogeneity and racial variation in the distribution of human leukocyte antigens between populations. The aim of the present study was to reexamine the relationship between these antigens and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a well-characterized series of patients. Ninety-six outpatients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and an additional 14 referred for liver transplantation with end-stage autoimmune chronic active hepatitis were studied. Human leukocyte antigen frequencies were compared with those of 100 racially and geographically matched controls. The A1-B8-DR3 haplotype was present in 38% of patients compared with 11% of controls (chi 2 = 20.6, p less than 0.0005). When all the DR3-positive patients were eliminated, there was a striking secondary association with DR4; 35 (80%) of 44 remaining patients were DR4 positive compared with 31 (39%) of 79 DR3-negative controls (Fisher's exact probability test p = 0.000031, pc = 0.0013). In addition patients with A1-B8-DR3 are seen at a significantly younger age than those without (39.75 yr vs. 48.21 yr, p less than 0.025), relapse more frequently (52% of patients with A1-B8-DR3 relapsed on one or more occasions compared with 34% of patients without this haplotype) and are more frequently referred for liver transplantation. These data indicate for the first time that two genes within the major histocompatibility complex closely linked to the DR3 and DR4 genes independently confer susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.\r"

Cross-sectional area and mean velocity were recorded from the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery at 30 min intervals, from 0 min to 150 min after ingestion. Flows were calculated. Pulsatility index, an index related to vascular resistance, was obtained for the mesenteric artery. Baseline flows did not differ between cirrhotic patients and control patients, but pulsatility index was reduced in the cirrhotic subjects. Maximal postprandial hyperemia was attained at 30 min. Cirrhotic patients showed a blunted hyperemic response to food. In normal controls, portal vein area increased significantly after the meal from 30 min to 150 min, whereas in cirrhotic patients a significant difference occurred only at 30 min. Pulsatility index in both groups was significantly reduced after eating, and this reduction persisted up to 150 min. No changes after ingestion of water were observed. Echo-Doppler was very sensitive in detecting postprandial splanchnic hemodynamic changes and differences between cirrhotic patients and normal subjects. Mesenteric artery pulsatility index was more sensitive than flow in detecting baseline hemodynamic differences. In cirrhotic patients, portal postprandial hyperemia was mainly related to the increase in mean velocity.\r"

In contrast, messenger RNA levels of cytochrome P450b and P450d did not vary significantly during that period. Steady-state messenger RNA levels for the placental form of glutathione S-transferase decreased within 30 min after partial hepatectomy but fluctuated until levels returned to normal by 48 hr. Preliminary nuclear run-on analyses suggest that the regulation of cytochrome P450j and the placental form of glutathione S-transferase messenger RNA levels involves posttranscriptional control in these animals. In ethanol-fed rats, as in controls, expression of cytochrome P450j and the placental form of glutathione S-transferase decreased transiently after partial hepatectomy. However, compared with control values, messenger RNA levels for cytochrome P450j were greater in ethanol-fed rats at each time point. Similar results were noted for placental glutathione S-transferase levels from 12 to 48 hr after partial hepatectomy. Ethanol feeding had no apparent effect on steady-state messenger RNA levels of cytochrome P450d, P450b or the multidrug-resistant gene. In both ethanol and control rats, only prehepatectomy levels of cytochrome P450 transcripts correlated with levels of the respective P450 isoenzymes. These data indicate that liver regeneration selectively decreases the steady-state messenger RNA expression of certain isoenzymes of cytochrome P450 and glutathione S-transferase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The hepatic oxidation of ethanol has been demonstrated to cause peroxidation of cellular membranes, resulting in the production of aldehydes that are substrates for hepatic aldehyde dehydrogenases. It was the purpose of this study to evaluate the cooxidation of the lipid peroxidation product, trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, and acetaldehyde by high-affinity mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is of prominent importance in the oxidation of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde. Experiments were performed for determination of kinetic parameters for uninhibited acetaldehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal oxidation by semi-purified mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rat liver. The affinity of the enzyme for the substrate at low substrate concentrations and the Michaelis-Menten constant of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase for acetaldehyde were 25 and 10 times greater, respectively, than those determined for 4-hydroxynonenal. Coincubation of acetaldehyde with physiologically relevant concentrations of 4-hydroxynonenal (0.25 to 5.0 mumol/L) with mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase demonstrated that 4-hydroxynonenal is a potent competitive or mixed-type inhibitor of acetaldehyde oxidation, with concentration of 4-hydroxynonenal required for a twofold increase in the slope of the Lineweaver-Burk plot for acetaldehyde oxidation by ALDH of 0.48 mumol/L. The results of this study suggest that the aldehydic lipid peroxidation product, trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, is a potent inhibitor of hepatic acetaldehyde oxidation and may potentiate the hepatocellular toxicity of acetaldehyde proposed to be an etiological factor of alcoholic liver disease.\r"

They stated that heterologous IgA was principally responsible for this effect. We have quantitated this growth by another method: enumeration of total and radiolabeled nuclei of the lumenal and glandular epithelium in transverse duct sections after tritiated thymidine injection and autoradiography. Our data show maximal incorporation between 18 and 24 hr after the last injection, with the highest labeling index in the lumenal epithelium after only three injections and before any duct enlargement. After four to seven injections, thymidine incorporation continued in juxtalumenal glands, together with massive glandular proliferation into the thickening wall and obvious inflammation. These changes were more pronounced in the liver-proximal part of the duct without affecting intrahepatic duct and gallbladder epithelia. Subcutaneous serum injections were less active. We confirm the inactivity of buffered saline, but, unlike previous authors, demonstrate strong activity in purified human milk secretory IgA and in IgA-deficient serum. We suggest that this different approach of quantitating epithelial proliferation will allow comparison of the bile duct growth effects of different, well-characterized human and animal IgA preparations.\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the level of hepatocyte growth factor in rat plasma at various times after two-thirds partial hepatectomy or CCl4 administration. An initial 17-fold rise and 13-fold rise in the level of hepatocyte growth factor was observed 2 hr after partial hepatectomy and CCl4 treatment, respectively, well before the onset of DNA synthesis in the liver. The peaks of DNA synthesis in remnant livers and livers exposed to CCl4 occurred at 24 hr and 48 hr, respectively, as determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine labeling and [3H]thymidine uptake by the liver. A later peak level (17-fold above control) of hepatocyte growth factor at 24 hr after CCl4 treatment coincided with strong immunostaining of damaged or necrotic hepatocytes around central veins with an antibody to hepatocyte growth factor. This suggests a later intrahepatic origin of the signals for liver regeneration after hepatotoxic injury subsequent to the early extrahepatic production of hepatocyte growth factor at 2 hr after CCl4 administration. The absence of staining in the liver remnants in partially hepatectomized rats implies that the increase in hepatocyte growth factor seen in the plasma is caused by production at extrahepatic site(s). Possible sources include the pancreas, brain, thyroid and salivary glands, and Brunner's glands of the duodenum. Norepinephrine also increases in plasma as early as 2 hr after hepatectomy. In vitro, [3H]thymidine incorporation into hepatocyte DNA in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor is greater if 10(-5) mol/L norepinephrine is also present in the media.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Three hours after ingestion of 1 gm/kg ethanol, number of Kupffer cells/number of sinusoids containing blood flow increased in both periportal and centrilobular regions by 62% and 66%, respectively, and blood ethanol was no longer detectable. Ultrastructurally, activation of KC was evidenced by the presence of many pseudopodia and filopodia. Numbers of swollen endothelial cells were increased in both regions by 249% and 174%. Interruption of sinusoidal blood flow by leukocytes was aggravated in both regions by 127% and 167%. Thirty minutes and 3 hr after ingestion of 4 gm/kg ethanol, no significant increase in number of Kupffer cells/number of sinusoids containing blood flow was seen, although number of Kupffer cells were also activated as seen with electron microscopy.

  ".W": "We previously reported that acetaldehyde increases the production of type I collagen in cultured rat fat-storing cells. We studied the regulation of this effect by determining the expression of procollagen type I, fibronectin and transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger RNAs in passage 1 and 2 cultures of fat-storing cells exposed to acetaldehyde for up to 24 hr. By 6 hr, acetaldehyde increased the steady-state levels of alpha 1 procollagen type I messenger RNA 3.2-fold and of fibronectin messenger RNA 2.8-fold above control values. At 24 hr, messenger RNA levels remained elevated. In contrast, transforming growth factor-beta 1 messenger RNA steady-state levels remained unaltered by 6 hr, but increased 1.5-fold by 24 hr. Cycloheximide (0.3 mmol/L) completely inhibited the acetaldehyde effect when added at zero time but was less effective when added at 15 min. The effect of acetaldehyde was not modified when cells were cultured in the presence of the acetaldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor cyanamide (100 mumol/L). Fat-storing cells were also cultured in the presence of lactate (5, 15 and 25 mmol/L) for 6 hr. At none of these concentrations was any effect seen on either alpha 1(I) procollagen or fibronectin messenger RNAs. In the presence of methylene blue, a scavenger of reducing equivalents, the effect of acetaldehyde on alpha 1(I) procollagen and fibronectin gene expression was totally inhibited. Transcription run-on assay showed that acetaldehyde increased both procollagen type I and fibronectin transcriptional activity threefold and 2.5-fold, respectively. We conclude that acetaldehyde increases alpha 1(I) procollagen and fibronectin gene expression through enhanced transcription by a mechanism dependent on newly synthesized proteins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The histological findings are portal tract inflammation and bile duct proliferation and destruction. In this study, evidence of injury to the extrahepatic and intrahepatic bile ducts in susceptible and resistant inbred rats with self-filling blind loops was determined by bile flow rates, histological appearance of cross-sections of bile ducts and cholangiography. Lewis and Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops had thickening of the cross-sectional area of the extrahepatic bile ducts compared with controls and nonsusceptible Buffalo rats (p less than 0.001). Daily metronidazole therapy significantly reduced thickening of bile ducts in Lewis and Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops. Bile flow was increased in Lewis and Wistar rats with blind loops compared with controls (p less than 0.05). Cholangiograms of Lewis and Wistar rats with self-filling blind loops demonstrated extrahepatic ductal dilatation and ectasia with irregular, beaded, rapidly tapering and tortuous intrahepatic ducts. Blinded cholangiographical scores of susceptible rat strains with self-filling blind loops were higher (score = 5.9 +/- 2.3) than those of controls (1.2 +/- 0.4), rats with blind loops treated with metronidazole (0.8 +/- 1.3) and nonsusceptible Buffalo rats with blind loops (0.6 +/- 0.9) (p less than 0.01). Biliary histological and cholangiographical abnormalities found in this rat model resemble features of primary sclerosing cholangitis. This animal model will be useful in exploring mechanisms of the association of hepatobiliary inflammation with intestinal injury and investigating potential therapeutic agents.\r"

Long-term administration of tumor necrosis factor causes liver hypertrophy, and our laboratory has shown that tumor necrosis factor acutely increases hepatic DNA synthesis. The purpose of this study was to determine which specific cell types in the liver undergo DNA synthesis in response to tumor necrosis factor. Light microscopic autoradiographs of 3H-thymidine incorporation demonstrate that tumor necrosis factor stimulates DNA synthesis in nonparenchymal cells, whereas the low level of DNA synthesis normally found in hepatocytes remains unaffected. Tumor necrosis factor increased labeling in sinusoidal cells that appeared to be Kupffer cells and in cells localized to the portal tracts. With electron microscopy and histochemical staining for endogenous peroxidase, the sinusoidal cells were clearly identified as Kupffer cells. The exact identity of the cells in the portal tract is less certain, but some of the cells shared the characteristics of bile duct precursors. With long-term administration of tumor necrosis factor, a striking proliferation of bile ducts was seen. The functional role of the proliferation of bile ducts in response to tumor necrosis factor is unclear, and it is not known whether the increase is a beneficial or deleterious response. The increased DNA synthesis in Kupffer cells could result in a potentially beneficial response to infection by increasing an animal's ability to phagocytize and clear microorganisms. However, under some circumstances, an expansion of the number of Kupffer cells could be deleterious by increasing an animal's ability to produce tumor necrosis factor and other cytokines that in large quantities can have toxic effects.\r"

Three experimental groups were studied: (a) control dogs (n = 5), (b) dogs 4 days after the creation of an end-to-side portacaval shunt (n = 5), and (c) dogs 4 days after portacaval shunt and continuous infusion of cyclosporin A (4 mg/kg/day) by way of the left portal vein (portacaval shunt plus cyclosporin A, n = 5). The phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained at 81 MHz using a Bruker BIOSPEC II 4.7-tesla nuclear magnetic resonance system equipped with a 40-cm horizontal bore superconducting solenoid. The phosphomonoesters (p less than 0.01), inorganic phosphate and ATP levels (p less than 0.05) were decreased significantly in portacaval shunt-treated and in portacaval shunt-plus-cyclosporin A-treated dogs compared with unshunted control dogs. After a fructose challenge (750 mg/kg body wt, intravenously), fructose-1-phosphate metabolism was reduced in portacaval shunt-treated dogs compared with either the normal or portacaval shunt-plus-cyclosporin A-treated dogs (p less than 0.05). Both portacaval shunt- and portacaval shunt-plus-cyclosporin A-treated dogs demonstrated a reduced decline in ATP levels after fructose infusion when compared with the controls (p less than 0.05). Immediately after the fructose challenge, the intracellular pH decreased from 7.30 +/- 0.03 to 7.00 +/- 0.05 in all animals (p less than 0.01) and then gradually returned to normal over 60 min.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The survey's sponsor says a carefully administered cost-reduction program for equipment maintenance can reap about a 20 percent savings.\r"

So it should come as no surprise to anyone that nurse-physician relations are also undergoing considerable changes these days. And although the relationship between hospital nurses and physicians has been a topic of ongoing concern for hospital executives for years, only recently has its improvement become an action item. Experts say a number of factors have brought new opportunity to the quest: the push for cost containment, the rising acuity of patients, continuing nursing shortages, societal and workplace changes, and, most of all, the drive toward systemwide quality in hospitals.\r"

And a growing number of organizations are setting guidelines on the use of patient monitors. Monitors of all kinds are being used to track the vital signs of patients in virtually every hospital department--from operating and recovery rooms to critical care units. And because existing guidelines are vague about where and when monitors are required, hospitals may need more monitors simply to avoid liability.\r"

The result: Hospitals face lower revenues and increasing tension as they compete for services with their medical staffs.\r"
