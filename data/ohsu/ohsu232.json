  ".W": "The establishment of Clusters of Differentiation for T- and B-lymphoid cells during International Workshops on Human Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens prompted the authors to evaluate the immunophenotypes in 160 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). In this group, 130 were of B-lymphocyte lineage (117 by monotypic immunoglobulin expression), and 30 of T-cell lineage. In the B-NHL series the expression of immunoglobulin isotypes, B-cell maturation/differentiation antigens of CD9, CD10, CD19-24, CD37, and CD38 (OKT10), HLA-DR and peanut agglutinin binding showed no significant relationship with histopathologic diagnosis as defined by the Kiel classification. Of the T-cell markers, CD5, CD6, and CD7 showed lineage promiscuity by their presence on some B-NHL. Conversely, the authors grouped the cases according to phenotypes (either CD antigens or immunoglobulin isotypes) which occur in distinct stages of (physiologic) B-cell maturation/differentiation. Eighty-six of the 130 cases could be fitted according to CD phenotype expression. This approach did not yield a significant relationship between phenotype and individual histopathologic categories either. The staging by CD phenotype and by immunoglobulin isotype yielded different results in this respect. Most B-NHL had an intermediate stage of B-cell maturation/differentiation. In the T-NHL series most cases showed a phenotype (CD1-CD8, CD38, TdT, and peanut agglutinin binding capacity) compatible with mature T-lymphocyte characteristics. The exceptions were lymphoblastic convoluted lymphomas, which exhibited an immature immunophenotype. It is concluded that NHL in distinct histopathologic categories are heterogeneous in immunologic phenotypes, and that the immunophenotype of lymphoma cells has no evident association with that of their presumed counterparts in physiologic cell maturation/differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The nephritogenic antigen of Heymann nephritis (HN)--a well-studied experimental rat model disease of human membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)--was recently shown to be a 330-kd glycoprotein (gp330) which is present in the membranes of both the rat tubular brush borders and of podocytes. Because the pathogenic antigen(s) of MGN are unknown, the authors have searched for a gp330-like molecule in human kidney and for its role in MGN. The authors here report that a membrane protein (apparent molecular weight 400 kd) is present in human kidney which is immunologically cross-reactive with rat gp330. By immunoelectron microscopy (using rabbit anti-rat gp330 IgG or a monoclonal anti-400-kd IgG) this molecule is similarly localized in human proximal tubules, but it is absent from the podocytes of human glomeruli. The 400-kd molecule is not detected in the glomerular immune deposits of 30 biopsies of MGN. It is proposed that this is due to the lack of the 400-kd protein in human glomeruli which prevents the formation of initial 400-kd anti-400-kd IgG immune complexes in situ.\r"

  ".W": "The use of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies for the immunophenotyping of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in paraffin-embedded tissue has been limited by the fact that most antigens on lymphoid cells are denatured by histologic fixation, dehydration, and embedment. In this article the authors have analyzed a small panel of antibodies which represent exceptions to this rule, in that they identify denaturation-resistant determinants on leukocyte antigens in paraffin-embedded tissue. Monoclonal antibodies L26 [corrected] and 4KB5 label preferentially B cells, monoclonal antibody UCHL1 stains predominantly T cells, and monoclonal antibody MAC 387 reacts with granulocytes and some macrophages. A polyclonal antiserum raised against purified CD3 (T3) antigen, a T-cell-specific molecule, was also employed. This antibody panel was used to immunophenotype routinely processed tissue biopsy specimens from 61 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (all of which had been previously phenotyped in cryostat sections). The lineage of the neoplastic cells was correctly identified in 32 of 34 (94%) cases of B-cell lymphoma, in 19 of 19 (100%) cases of T-cell neoplasm, and in 2 of 4 (50%) cases of histiocytic malignancy. It is concluded that this combination of antibodies is helpful in immunophenotyping non-Hodgkin's lymphomas when only paraffin-embedded tissue sections are available, although additional reagents of higher specificity are required to improve the identification of lymphomas.\r"

Basal lamina (laminin and Type IV collagen) and stroma (collagens I, III, and V and fibronectin) constituents were studied. It was found that these tumors synthesize ECM in characteristic patterns. Five Ewing's sarcomas variably synthesized small amounts of all ECM constituents except Type V collagen. All eight neural tumors (neuroblastoma and primitive neural tumors) synthesized fibronectin (unlike some Ewing's sarcomas), as well as laminin and Type IV collagen (2 cases lacked Type IV collagen synthesis). No stromal (I/III) collagen synthesis was observed by neural tumors. All soft tissue sarcomas except an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma synthesized stromal collagens and often laminin or fibronectin as well. Lymphomas synthesized no ECM of any kind. The synthesis of stromal collagens by sarcomas but not neural tumors serves to distinguish these two tumor types, especially Ewing's sarcoma from neuroblastoma. The presence of any ECM synthesis excludes lymphoma from diagnostic consideration.\r"

Micropapillary hyperplasia occurs in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, in localized cystic disease, and in acquired cystic disease. Neoplastic or severely dysplastic epithelial hyperplasia occurs in von Hippel-Lindau disease. A histopathologically distinctive epithelial hyperplasia occurs in tuberous sclerosis. In each of these conditions, epithelial hyperplasia may be related to cyst formation and may also impose an increased risk of malignancy--a risk that seems to be highest in patients under treatment with long-term hemodialysis for end-stage kidney disease. Although hyperplasia in some of these diseases may share a common pathway of development, it is more probable that the histopathologic differences reflect different pathogenetic pathways that converge on a common endpoint.\r"

Long-standing providers preferred a categorical approach in order to maintain a diverse political coalition for an historically invisible service. In addition, categorical funding meant financial support for non-traditional providers. A compelling argument was also made for service integration. Given an expanded definition of health and the medicalization of contraceptive technology, the health delivery system presented itself as the appropriate service provider. Neither group prevailed. By 1980, federally supported family planning services were provided in autonomous clinics but also were integrated into existing maternal and child health programs. The debate continues but, under the Reagan Administration, terms and motivations differ from those of the past.\r"

Parasite clearance is slower when young rings predominate at the time of treatment. This should be taken into account when considering the clinical management of patients and the comparative efficacy of antimalarials in clearing parasites from the peripheral blood. The 36-48 hr delay in schizonticidal action observed after treatment of febrile infections and the associated decline in blood concentrations of pyrimethamine suggest that a single dose may not be the ideal way of administering this drug combination and may encourage the emergence of drug-resistant parasites.\r"

In an initial trial the hybridization assay had a specificity for P. falciparum of 100% and a sensitivity of 68%. False negative results were obtained only on samples with low parasitemia. Assay of red cells collected during an earlier malaria survey which had been stored for 1 year at -20 degrees C gave a higher level of sensitivity (85%), suggesting a beneficial effect from freezing and thawing. This was confirmed by examining in the same assay red cells processed immediately after collection and after 2 weeks of storage at -20 degrees C. Freezing and thawing gave a 21% increase in positivity, and a sensitivity of 100% was achieved with the frozen samples. Quantitation of autoradiographs by visual inspection and by scintillation counting gave a reasonable correlation with parasite counts. The DNA hybridization assay has considerable promise as an epidemiological tool.\r"

Patent infections were induced in 22 of 27 unaltered and 20 of 21 splenectomized recipients during 19 serial passages. The infections were significantly more virulent in splenectomized than normal Panamanian owl monkeys, however recrudescences in seven normal monkeys achieved peak parasitemias 48 times greater than in the primary attack. These results describe the first reproducible infections of indigenous falciparum malaria in Panamanian owl monkeys.\r"

Sporogony was completed in 10-11 days post-infection. There was no difference in the longevity of uninfected and infected females. Infected females survived an average of 30 days (maximum 63 days). Sporozoites survived up to 50 days in the salivary glands without any observable changes in structure and motility. These data indicate that An. superpictus is an efficient laboratory vector of P. vivax and should not be ignored in future entomological field studies.\r"

In contrast, only 5 of the biopsies and 4 of the aspirates yielded promastigotes upon culture in vitro. Similarly, all but 2 of the aspirates and one-half of the biopsies were reported as negative for parasites when stained with Wright's and hematoxylin-eosin, respectively. Serum antibody titers, ranging from 1:8 to 1:128, corroborated the results of the amastigote detection assays when histopathology and isolation were negative. These findings support the practicality of using the genus-specific monoclonal IFA in those field situations where it becomes necessary to differentiate leishmaniasis from other skin infections.\r"

Using formalin-fixed trophozoites, the pattern of fluorescence changed to include diffuse internal fluorescence with both homologous and heterologous pairs. In contrast to the variability in surface fluorescence, similar reactivity was noted for homologous and heterologous antisera-isolate pairs with the ELISA. In addition, a double antibody enzyme immunoassay using rabbit antisera prepared to 2 G. lamblia isolates was performed with 8 different isolates as test antigen. All 8 were equally well detected. These data confirm previous findings that G. lamblia isolates have both different and common antigens. The different antigens appear to be on the surface of the organism while the common antigens appear to be internal or somatic.\r"

In the 10 known cases, all patients were women, and the usual location of nodules containing the worms was the scalp or a covered part of the upper body where blackflies, the intermediate hosts of D. ursi, normally feed.\r"

  ".W": "The AO plate represents an acceptable reconstructive choice for mandibular defects, with an 86.7 percent success rate demonstrated in this series. Because this method utilizes an alloplast which is precisely and quickly applied, virtually all patients requiring mandibular resection can be considered candidates for reconstruction. Adequate vascularized soft tissue coverage is essential to prevent plate extrusion and fistula formation. This is even more important for radiated patients. The pectoralis major myocutaneous flap provides muscle and skin for large anterior defects. Frequently, lateral defects can be closed primarily without using regional flaps. We suggest bone reconstruction to avoid potential plate fracture and to allow placement of functional dentures. Resections in elderly patients and for palliation will result in ideal cosmetic and functional results with the plate alone. If we exclude the four patients reconstructed with calcium hydroxyapatite and the AO plate, the morbidity rate is quite acceptable. With this group excluded, only four fistulas and eight plate exposures occurred. Only four plate removals were required to achieve wound closure. Evaluation of the titanium plate is in progress. It is hoped that better osseous and soft tissue integration will help to decrease wound complications. A large prospective review of postoperative radiotherapy patients using the new titanium plate has been designed to address this issue. The therapeutic choice between the AO plate and free vascularized bone graft reconstruction remains. The decision process is dependent on the technical skills of the surgeon, the treatment plan, the survival characteristics of the tumor, and the physiologic condition of the patient.\r"

Speech studies show that although there is loss of certain speech sounds, approximate sounds are substituted. Speech is intelligible when soft-tissue contact to the palate can be accomplished. The adaptive mechanisms in these patients have been compared with the mechanisms used by a patient with uncorrected congenital aglossia and hypomandibulosis who developed excellent speech and swallowing. The mobility of this patient's mouth and pharynx was similar to that in the reconstructed cancer patients who were able to swallow and speak.

  ".W": "The first pass uptake of fentanyl, meperidine, and morphine in human lung was studied in patients using a double indicator dilution technique. A bolus containing one of the drugs and indocyanine green dye (ICG) was rapidly injected into the central venous catheter of patients prior to anesthesia for surgery. Sequential arterial blood samples were collected at 1-s intervals for 45 s after injection. The total amount of drug taken up by the lung during the first pass and the instantaneous extraction of drug at each time point during the first pass were calculated from the differences in the arterial blood concentration versus time curves of the nondiffusible indicator (ICG) and the drug. The total uptake (mean +/- SE) during the first pass through the human lung for fentanyl and meperidine was 75.2 +/- 3.2% and 64.7 +/- 7.8% of the injected dose, respectively. The pulmonary uptake of morphine was very small, with 96.5 +/- 7.1% of the injected dose recovered in arterial blood after the first pass through the lung. The arterial blood concentration of drug and dye versus time showed a slight delay of the fentanyl and meperidine peaks compared to ICG. It was also observed that greater than 90% of these drugs were extracted from the blood in the early part of the first pass, but the extraction decreased with time during the first pass through the lung. These findings indicate that some of the drug taken up by the lung can diffuse back out into the blood.2+off\r"

  ".W": "Systolic pressure variation (SPV) is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of systolic blood pressure following a single positive pressure breath. An increase in the SPV is known to occur clinically during hypovolemia. This study aims to quantify SPV during graded hemorrhage in ventilated dogs, and to compare its reliability relative to other hemodynamic indicators of hypovolemia. Ten anesthetized dogs were mechanically ventilated with a fixed tidal volume. A continuously inflated vest was applied around the chest to maintain the ratio of lung to chest wall compliance similar to that of humans (0.83 +/- 0.12). SPV was further divided into delta up and delta down components relative to apneic (5 s) systolic blood pressure. Dogs were bled 5, 10, 20, and 30% of their estimated blood volume. The measured parameters best correlated to the amount of bleeding were SPV (rs = 0.993), delta down (rs = 0.981), and cardiac output (rs = 0.976). The SPV and its delta down component correlated to the degree of hemorrhage as well as the CO and the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and significantly better than the central venous pressure and the mean systemic blood pressure. Thus, SPV and its delta down component are accurate indicators of hypovolemia in ventilated dogs subjected to hemorrhage.\r"

It is shown that the laser Doppler frequencies correlated well with results from venous occlusion plethysmography, which measured volume rate of flow. Thus, one can determine volume rate of flow by the simple Doppler method. There was a linear relationship between these two methods of measurements. Using the LDF method, it was determined that normal individuals have toe flows that on the average are 42% of finger flows in supine resting subjects. In peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, the LDF measurements showed a decreased circulation in the large toes when the patients are supine and the lower extremities flat. The results between health and disease are exaggerated by elevating the feet, at which time the diseased circulation falls to extremely low values compared with those of normal subjects. A similar decrease in skin oxygen tension in the diseased lower extremities was observed when the limbs were elevated.\r"

The authors reviewed 221 cases of histologically proven CCE in the English literature to define the clinical, laboratory, and pathologic characteristics of this disorder. CCE affected predominantly elderly males (mean age sixty-six) with a frequent history of hypertension (61%), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (44%), renal failure (34%), and aortic aneurysms (25%) at presentation. At least one possible predisposing factor was present in 31% and included operative and radiological vascular procedures and the use of anticoagulants. Cutaneous findings (34%) and renal failure (50%) were two of the most common clinical findings throughout the course of CCE. The nonspecific signs and symptoms included: fever (7%), weight loss (7%), myalgias (4%), and headache (3%). Premortem diagnoses were established in 31% of patients most commonly by biopsy of the muscle, skin, and kidney. Mortality was high (81%) and was most commonly due to multifactorial, cardiac, and renal etiologies. The authors conclude that CCE should be strongly considered in elderly patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease who have the onset of renal insufficiency and cutaneous manifestations. CCE may be confirmed by a skin or muscle biopsy.\r"

The treadmill data from these more severely ill patients were analyzed separately as a \"severe subset\" (placebo n = 17; pentoxifylline n = 21). No differences between the two treatment groups were observed in demography, history, or baseline treadmill walking distances. The initial claudication distance (ICD) improved 68% over baseline with pentoxifylline and 12% with placebo (p = .012) after twenty-four weeks of treatment. A new, derived efficacy variable was developed, \"minimum distance walked,\" which tended to minimize psychological effects on treadmill performance. Over sixteen to twenty-four weeks of treatment, the pentoxifylline group improved 49% over baseline and the placebo group 3% (p = .019), when the \"minimum distance walked\" measurement was used. In this controlled trial the subset of patients with severe intermittent claudication benefited from pentoxifylline therapy.\r"

We tested whether calcium entry blockade with verapamil (11 cases) or nifedipine (11 cases) may improve the vascular regulation in high blood pressure. Mental arithmetic and cold were used as adrenergic activators. The former stimulus produced obvious elevation of epinephrine plasma concentration, increase of cardiac output (CO), slight systemic vasodilatation, pulmonary vasoconstriction, and rise of blood pressure in both circuits. After calcium antagonists, the epinephrine reaction to the arithmetic test was significantly attenuated, variations in CO and systemic blood pressure were unchanged, pulmonary vasoconstriction was abolished, and the pressure rise in the lesser circuit was halved. The cold pressor test increased norepinephrine plasma concentration (NE pc), systemic and pulmonary blood pressure, and vascular resistance and did not alter CO. The attained NE pc during cold was unvaried after verapamil and significantly enhanced after nifedipine; pressure and resistance responses of the two circuits were almost unchanged after the former, whereas systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance rises were importantly attenuated after the latter compound, resulting in much lower pressure reactivity. A modulation of the sympathoadrenal reaction, per se, can explain changes in the systemic and in the pulmonary vasomotion with calcium blockade during arithmetic. It would seem that after verapamil the sympathetic system was still activated during cold to such an extent as to maintain the same vasoconstrictor potency. NE pc suggests that the sympathetic discharge was not reduced by nifedipine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The minimal hematologic criteria should always be searched for before accepting a case as IM or an IM-like illness. If minimal morphologic data are not rigidly adhered to, the number of heterophil-negative cases included under the umbrella of IM or an IM-like illness will swell and include a variety of other illnesses where early diagnosis may be important for treatment purposes. When EBV studies are indicated, the entire profile (VCA-IgM, VCA-IgG, and anti-EBNA) should be performed. Anti-VCA-IgG titers alone, for example, are of very limited usefulness unless they are negative (less than 1:10), in which case the diagnosis of EBV-IM is excluded. The main problems connected with the diagnosis of the CMS center about the nonspecificity of both clinical and EBV serologic data. Thus, a significant effort must be made to rule out underlying disease, especially those chronic illnesses with immunosuppressive effects that are capable of reactivating the EBV latency state and producing EBV serology similar to that seen in CMS. Other dilemmas relate to diagnostic cut-off levels for particular EBV-related tests, including antibodies to EA and the relative unavailability of several tests for detection of subtle immunodeficiency or T-cell dysfunction in individual patients with suspected CMS. Future efforts will be directed to the diagnostic usefulness of antibody responses to well-defined recombinant fragments of the EBV genome (ie, anti-EBNA1 vs. -EBNA2 titers).\r"

In this study we tried to determine if this relationship existed in childhood asthma. One hundred and forty-five asthmatic children aged 6 to 19 years with a positive methacholine (MCH) challenge test and a baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) of 56% to 118% predicted were studied. The MCH concentration required to decrease the FEV1 from baseline by 20% (PC20) ranged from 0.1 to 20 mg/mL (geometric mean = 1.85 mg/mL). Asthma symptoms in this population before the study ranged from 2 months to 14 years. They were followed for a mean of 10 months after the MCH challenge and then grouped into four groups according to overall severity of symptoms and treatment needed to control symptoms. The first grade was comprised of patients with intermittent symptoms only, with a respiratory tract infection (URTI), and no medication; grade 2 symptoms were severe enough to require intermittent bronchodilators (BD); grade 3 symptoms were severe enough to require daily BD; and grade 4 symptoms were severe enough to require daily BD and steroids. Geometric means PC20 were significantly different among the four groups when they were analyzed by ANOVA P less than .01. There was, however, marked overlap between the individual levels of PC20 among the four groups. There was no significant difference in mean FEV1, age, sex, or duration of symptoms among the four groups. There was no significant correlation between baseline FEV1 and the degree of airway hyperreactivity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

PaO2 initially was 7.55 kPa in the intravenous group and rose by 1.4 after 60 minutes (P less than .02) and by 1.33 after 120 minutes (P less than .01). The mean PaO2 did not change in the inhalation group. The pulse rate and blood pressure did not vary significantly in either of the two groups.

Clinical differentiation from venous thrombosis was usually impossible. Contrast arthrography was the definitive diagnostic investigation, revealing popliteal cysts in all patients, and an active synovial leak into the calf in 13 cases (87%). The mean delay in performing arthrography was 5.3 days, the procedure usually being performed after normal contrast venography. Doppler and isotope venography yielded misleading or equivocal results (42%) delaying diagnosis, and prolonging periods of potentially dangerous anticoagulation. We suggest that the marked overlap in the emergency presentation of popliteal cyst rupture and calf vein thrombosis mandates the aggressive use of arthrography combined with venography in all patients presenting with a painful swollen leg.\r"

  ".W": "This is the first prospective clinical trial recorded to date of short-course chemotherapy in pulmonary tuberculosis complicated by pneumoconiosis. Forty-eight anthrasillicotic and 11 silicotic patients with previously untreated pulmonary tuberculosis completed 9-month, short-course chemotherapy regimens: 2 months of daily streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampicin, and pyrazinamide followed by daily isoniazid and rifampicin for 7 months (2SHRZ/7HR). There were 3 treatment failures (5%). The remaining 56 patients (95%) all had their sputum converted within 4 months (mean, 1.5 months). Bacteriologic relapses were noted in 3 patients (5%) after 18 to 40 months of follow-up (mean, 28.4 months). The relapses occurred within 7 months after chemotherapy was stopped. There were 2 deaths from nontuberculosis causes during the follow-up period. Fifty-one patients (90%) remained bacteriologically sterile for 28.4 +/- 6.1 months. These results suggest that the 2SHRZ/7HR regimen is satisfactory in treating anthrasilicotic or silicotic patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, though antituberculosis chemotherapy seemed less effective in patients with pneumoconiosis than in those without pneumoconiosis.\r"

  ".W": "Human alveolar macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage are usually poor accessory cells for antigen-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation and poor stimulators of allogeneic mixed leukocyte reactions (MLR) when compared to peripheral blood monocytes. In contrast, cells harvested from minced lungs are good stimulators of a MLR. We have characterized the accessory cells obtained after enzymatic digestion of human lung tissue. Pulmonary mononuclear cells were separated from the dissociated lung cell mixture on Ficoll-Hypaque. Loosely adherent cells (LAM) were obtained after an overnight incubation on plastic culture dishes of initially adherent mononuclear cells. LAM were significantly more effective than were pulmonary mononuclear cells (p less than 0.05), firmly adherent cells (p less than 0.05), alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (p less than 0.05), or monocytes (p less than 0.05) in stimulating allogeneic resting T-cells. Addition of indomethacin and catalase markedly improved T-cell proliferation induced by LAM. Enrichment for Fc receptor negative or for nonphagocytic cells further enhanced the MLR-stimulating capacity of LAM. Phase-contrast studies demonstrated an enrichment in cells compatible with dendritic cells in LAM as compared to firmly adherent cells. We conclude that there are potent accessory cells in human lung that are loosely adherent, Fc receptor negative, and poorly phagocytic, and thus are dissimilar from classic macrophages. We hypothesize that cells similar to dendritic cells might play a role in the initiation of immune responses in lung parenchyma.\r"

  ".W": "Ten clinically stable, hypercapneic patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were studied to assess the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade on their inability to excrete a sodium load. Renal, hormonal, and cardiovascular responses to sodium loading were determined during two 5.5-h studies: control day, placebo; and experimental day, captopril. At baseline, compared with control subjects, patients displayed a decrease in urinary sodium associated with low effective renal plasma flow and high plasma level of aldosterone. Captopril, given before sodium loading, produced a significant increase in urinary sodium without increasing effective renal plasma flow and without suppressing plasma aldosterone more than sodium loading alone. Thus, the mechanism by which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition induces an acute sodium diuresis in these patients remains to be elucidated. The blockade of angiotensin with captopril also affected the osmotic regulation of vasopressin: for a given increase in plasma osmolality, the increase in plasma vasopressin was subnormal, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that angiotensin II contributes to the regulation of vasopressin secretion.\r"

  ".W": "Airway pressure, flow, and volume were measured before and after administration of aerosolized metaproterenol during controlled mechanical inflation and stepwise deflation of the relaxed respiratory system in 13 mechanically ventilated patients. An increase in passive expiratory flow at constant respiratory system recoil pressure was considered evidence of bronchodilatation. In 10 patients, at a respiratory system recoil pressure of 6 cm H2O (VP6), expiratory flow increased 21 to 500% above prebronchodilator level. In these 10 dynamically hyperinflated patients, an increase in VP6 was associated with a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure (Ppeak) (mean delta = -4.7 cm H2O) and a decrease in intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (Peepi) (mean delta = -2.4 cm H2O). The elastance of the respiratory system was not affected by metaproterenol, and the delta Peepi corresponded to a mean decrease in end-expiratory lung volume of 0.20 L. The results are consistent with predictions based on a single-compartment model. When mean expiratory flow is determined only by the tidal volume and expiratory time, a decrease in airway resistance results in a decrease in lung volume at which patients are ventilated. Therefore, the decrease in Ppeak is caused not only by a decrease in the resistive pressure cost but also by a decrease in the elastic pressure cost of inflating the respiratory system. It is emphasized that Ppeak and Peepi provide valuable information about bronchodilator-induced changes in lung function during controlled mechanical ventilation.\r"

The purpose of this study was to examine thoracoabdominal continuous negative pressure ventilation (CNPV) using external negative end-expiratory pressure (NEEP). The effects on gas exchange and hemodynamics were compared with those of CPPV with PEEP, with the premise that CNPV might sustain venous return and improve QT. In 6 supine, anesthetized and paralyzed dogs with oleic-acid-induced pulmonary edema, 30 min of CNPV was alternated twice with 30 min of CPPV. Positive and negative pressure ventilation were carefully matched for fractional inspired oxygen concentration (FIO2 = 0.56), breathing frequency, and tidal volume. In addition, we matched the increase in delta FRC obtained with the constant distending pressures produced by both modes of ventilation. An average of -9 cm H2O of NEEP produced the same delta FRC as 10.8 cm H2O of PEEP. Gas exchange did not differ significantly between the 2 modes. However, QT was 15.8% higher during CNPV than during CPPV (p less than 0.02). Mixed venous oxygen saturation also improved during CNPV compared with that during CPPV (58.3 versus 54.5%, p less than 0.01). Negative pressure ventilation using NEEP may be a viable alternative to positive pressure ventilation with PEEP in the management of critically ill patients with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. It offers comparable improvement in gas exchange with the advantages of less cardiac depression and the possible avoidance of endotracheal intubation.\r"

We applied high resolution computed tomography to 20 postmortem lung specimens fixed by a method that allows for direct one-to-one pathologic-radiologic correlation. The degree of centrilobular emphysema was assessed radiologically on a visual grading system based on nonperipheral low-attenuation areas. The lungs were then sectioned along the plane of the CT image, and the degree of centrilobular emphysema was graded pathologically by scoring against a panel of standards. A significant correlation (r = 0.91, p less than 0.005) was found between the pathologic grade and the in vitro CT score.\r"

In 8 normal subjects, methacholine challenges were performed 24 h before and 24 and 72 h after a LTD4 challenge. Doubling doses of methacholine (1.3 to 655 mumol) or LTD4 (0.007 to 192 nmol) were inhaled by using a recently validated method. The highest dose of LTD4 was followed by the maximal dose of methacholine. The response was measured by FEV1 and volume history standardized partial expiratory flow-volume curves (V40p), and was expressed as percent fall from baseline. All subjects reached a maximal response plateau to both agonists. The maximal response plateau to LTD4 was systematically higher than to methacholine on the preceding day (mean difference, 13.4 and 12.7% fall for FEV1 and V40p, respectively) (p less than 0.01). Addition of methacholine on top of the LTD4 plateau caused a further increase in the response (mean, 6.6 and 4.8% fall, respectively) (p less than 0.005). The maximal responses to methacholine at 24 and 72 h after the LTD4 challenge were higher than at 24 h before (mean difference at 24 h, 4.0 and 8.5% fall for FEV1 and V40p, respectively, and at 72 h 5.7 and 9.3% fall) (p less than 0.05). However, the provocative dose of methacholine causing a 10% fall in FEV1 (PD10) or a 40% fall in V40p (PD40) was not altered by the previous LTD4 challenge test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is capable of inducing both acute bronchoconstrictor responses in the lung in addition to increasing airway responsiveness to non-specific factors. It is this latter property that is especially intriguing since no other mediator of immediate hypersensitivity has been demonstrated to have such striking properties. The recent demonstration of induction of persistent (as long as 2 wk) airway hyperresponsiveness in humans after aerosolized PAF is an exciting development in our understanding of potential mediators of this entity. Much remains to be defined regarding the role of PAF in bronchial asthma including the cellular source of its production, the dependence of its effect upon other cell types such as platelets and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the secondary mediator or mediators released from recruited cells, which are involved in producing the final pathophysiologic picture, and the mechanism by which altered airway responsiveness occurs.\r"

However, there is increasing evidence that it is a metabolically active tissue that may modulate the function of the underlying smooth muscle by metabolism and regulation of mediators and the production of relaxant, constrictor, or chemotactic factors. It is therefore possible that the epithelial abnormalities observed in asthmatics may lead, via several different mechanisms, to increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness (figure 2), which is a fundamental feature of asthma. However, it may not be necessary to invoke structural damage to explain derangement of epithelial function. It is possible that functional biochemical abnormalities may be present in epithelial cells, thereby producing bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the absence of histologic abnormalities. Further studies with bronchial epithelium, similar to those with vascular endothelium, are needed to clarify its role in the pathogenesis of asthma.\r"

DESIGN: Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel trial of ibuprofen compared with acetaminophen and with placebo in 3-week treatment periods. SETTING: A general internal medicine clinic at a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-five patients with essential hypertension controlled by treatment with at least two antihypertensive drugs were enrolled. Of these, 41 completed the study; treatment was discontinued in 3 of the 15 patients in the ibuprofen group due to breakage of the drug capsules, and after randomization in 1 of the 14 patients in the placebo group due to unstable angina. All 15 patients in the acetaminophen group completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: All previous antihypertensive regimens were continued. During the 3-week treatment, ibuprofen, 400 mg, was administered orally every 8 hours; acetaminophen, 1 g, orally every 8 hours; or placebo, 2 capsules, orally every 8 hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the ibuprofen group, the mean increase from baseline after 3 weeks of treatment was significant in the average supine diastolic blood pressure (6.4 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05 to 11.75; p = 0.0239); supine mean arterial pressure (6.6 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.25 to 11.95; p = 0.0205); and sitting mean arterial pressure (5.8 mm Hg; 95% CI, 1.57 to 10.04; p = 0.0123). The mean increase in blood pressure variables in the ibuprofen group was significantly different compared with the mean increase in the variables in the placebo group after 3 weeks of treatment: supine systolic blood pressure (7.1 mm Hg compared with -4.5 mm Hg; 95% CI for the difference in means, 2.5 to 20.6; p = 0.0133); supine diastolic pressure (6.4 mm Hg compared with 0.0; 95% CI for difference in means, 0.87 to 12.4; p = 0.0250); supine mean arterial pressure (6.6 mm Hg compared with -1.5; 95% CI for difference in means, 2.0 to 14.2; p = 0.0110); sitting systolic pressure (6.8 mm Hg compared with -3.7; 95% CI for difference in means, 2.0 to 19.0; p = 0.0169); sitting diastolic pressure (5.3 mm Hg compared with -1.1; 95% CI for difference in means, 0.76 to 12.1; p = 0.0273); and sitting mean arterial pressure (5.8 mm Hg compared with -2.0; 95% CI for difference in means, 1.5 to 14.1; p = 0.0169).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

DESIGN: Randomized trial with both masked and unmasked comparisons of outcome after a median follow-up of 13 days (range, 4 to 77 days). SETTING: Urban, academic referral, and primary care medical center. PATIENTS: Of 140 potentially eligible hospitalized patients with pressure sores, 72 consented to randomization; 65 (90%) completed the study. INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-one patients on air-fluidized beds (Clinitron Therapy, Support Systems International, Inc., Charleston, South Carolina) repositioned every 4 hours from 0700h to 2300h without use of other antipressure devices. Thirty-four patients on conventional therapy used an alternating air-mattress covered by a foam pad (Lapidus Air Float System, American Pharmaceal Company, Cincinnati, Ohio) on a regular hospital bed; were repositioned every 2 hours; and had elbow or heel pads as needed. Topical therapy was standardized for both groups. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Pressure sores showed a median decrease in total surface area (-1.2 cm2) on air-fluidized beds, but showed a median increase (+ 0.5 cm2) on conventional therapy; 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference between medians, -9.2 to -0.6 cm2 (p = 0.01). Improvement, as assessed from serial color photographs by investigators masked to treatment group, occurred in 71% and 47%, respectively; 95% CI for the difference, 1% to 47% (p = 0.05). For pressure sores 7.8 cm2 or greater, outcome differences between air-fluidized beds and conventional therapy were greater: median total surface area change was -5.3 and +4.0 cm2, respectively; 95% CI for the difference, -42.2 to -3.2 cm2 (p = 0.01). Improvement rates were 62% and 29% respectively; 95% CI for difference, 1% to 65% (p = 0.05). After adjusting for other factors associated with sore outcome, the estimated relative odds of showing improvement with air-fluidized beds were 5.6-fold (95% CI, 1.4 to 21.7) greater than with conventional therapy (p = 0.01). No significant increase in adverse effects was seen with air-fluidized beds. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that air-fluidized beds are more effective than conventional therapy, particularly for large pressure sores. Studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of air-fluidized beds in long-term care settings.\r"

To identify risk factors we analyzed pulmonary function tests of 281 adult patients 1 year after marrow transplantation. The forced expiratory volume at 1 second divided by the forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) was used to measure airflow rates. Factors associated with a lower year-1 FEV1/FVC (%) included increased age (p less than 0.0001), male gender (p = 0.02), cigarette smoking (p = 0.01), lower FEV1/FVC before transplantation (p less than 0.0001), HLA-nonidentical grafts (p = 0.001), chronic graft-versus-host disease (p = 0.0002), and immunosuppressive therapy with methotrexate (p = 0.01). There was no significant association between the year-1 FEV1/FVC and underlying disease, dose of conditioning irradiation, or development of acute graft-versus-host disease. Linear multivariate regression analysis, after controlling for the FEV1/FVC before transplantation, shows both chronic graft-versus-host disease and administration of methotrexate independently associated with decrements in the year-1 FEV1/FVC. The combined occurrence of chronic graft-versus-host disease and methotrexate also was strongly associated with decreases in the year-1 FEV1/FVC, indicating an interaction of these risk factors.\r"

The patient's plasma contained circulating insulin receptor autoantibodies, thought to cause hypoglycemia by their insulin-like actions. With prednisone therapy, her other autoimmune features improved, and the hypoglycemia eventually resolved. Hypoglycemia mediated by insulin receptor autoantibodies should be considered in patients with fasting hypoglycemia and features suggesting an underlying autoimmune disorder before pursuing more invasive procedures. High-dose steroids may be life-saving in this disorder.\r"

However, in patients with symptomatic bradyarrhythmias, optimal function of \"atrial-tracking\" devices may be limited by concomitant sinoatrial disease. Provision of chronotropic response during physical exertion or emotional stress may be achieved by using physiologic sensors to alter pacing rate independently of atrial activity. Additional systems using sensor technologies are being developed. Future pacing systems will have dual-chamber pacing capability and may use several sensors coupled synergistically in order to take advantage of particular strengths of each. Physiologic sensor technology may be of diagnostic value in both antitachycardia devices and implantable cardioverter and defibrillator systems.\r"

With the growth of litigation on toxic substances and unsafe products, more and more courts must wrestle with the complicated scientific proof of the relation between exposure and disease or injury. This proof frequently involves the use of probabilistic evidence in the form of statistical tests and epidemiologic studies. Anglo-American law relies on deductive notions of causation and is suspicious of probabilistic evidence of causation. As a result, court decisions of hazardous substance cases are sometimes based on a confused understanding of the critical causal connection. Physicians who testify in such cases, either as the treating doctor or as expert witnesses, must be aware of the court's difficulty with probabilistic evidence. In addition, physicians must state clearly the role of such evidence in the identification of a hazardous substance as the cause of a disease or injury.\r"

We have termed this operation \"intraepikeratophakia.\" The technique is based on the same principles as keratophakia. The epithelium is removed surgically and reapproximated over the transplanted lenticule. Twenty-two patients underwent conventional epikeratophakia, and ten underwent intraepikeratophakia. Of the 32 patients in this study, three required removal of the donor lenticule. All of these patients were in the epikeratophakia group, and all failures were secondary to poor reepithelialization of the lenticule. Of the ten patients who underwent intraepikeratophakia, nine had complete reepithelialization by the second postoperative day. On the average, these patients required 77% less time to reepithelialize completely compared with epikeratophakia patients. Patients in the intraepikeratophakia group were also more comfortable throughout their postoperative course probably as a result of the faster rate of reepithelialization. Intraepikeratophakia offers definite advantages over epikeratophakia and is a viable alternative to patients requiring refractive keratoplasty.\r"

The retinal tissue of Balb/c and C57B1/6J mice stained well when we used the guinea-pig antibody to guinea-pig retinal extract. In contrast, the eyes of a subline, i.e., C57B1/6J-rd with retinal degeneration, did not stain. Likewise, the eyes of C3H/HeJ and SJL mice with abnormal retinas did not stain. The latter two strains are known to have retinal degeneration. The control studies were negative. This study shows that normal murine eyes have at least one antigen which cross-reacts with a guinea-pig retinal antigen. It also shows abnormal mouse retinas lack this antigen.\r"

The recognition of a genetic disorder as the cause of a stroke has important implications not only for the immediate care of the stroke victim, but often also for others in the patient's family who may be at risk for the same disease and for whom preventive measures sometimes can be taken. We present here a comprehensive review of genetic disorders associated with stroke in the nongeriatric age groups for which a causative role in the evolution of stroke has been recognized or is likely. For each disorder, the major clinical and biochemical characteristics as well as the probable pathogenetic mechanisms of stroke are discussed, together with the appropriate testing required to screen for and confirm the diagnosis. The great variety of genetic disorders and mechanisms causing stroke underscores the increasing importance of understanding genetic disease for appropriate diagnosis and treatment of a common clinical problem affecting both children and adults.\r"

  ".U": "88022542\r", 
  ".W": "The autoimmune origin of the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) was documented by passive transfer of its electrophysiological features from humans to mice with IgG. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy has demonstrated a loss of active-zone particles in human LEMS and in its mouse passive transfer model. These data imply that the active zones are targets of the pathogenic LEMS autoantibodies. Immunolocalization of the antibodies has been hindered, however, by a paucity of active-zone particles (about 50/micron2 normally and still lower in LEMS) and by diffusion artifacts in the immunoperoxidase method. To obviate these problems, we employed sensitive avidin-biotin detection systems, both peroxidase and ferritin labels, and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy and end-plate morphometry. We compared mice treated with LEMS IgG, control IgG, and no IgG. In all mice, nonspecific background staining was found in the basal lamina covering the muscle fibers and Schwann cells. When a single 10-mg dose of IgG was injected intravenously, IgG samples from 12 patients produced significant immunostaining of the mouse active zones; from 7 patients they did not. Higher doses of intraperitoneally injected IgG (20 mg, three times a day for 2 days, or 10 mg/day for 15 days) from each of 4 patients (3 of whose IgG previously transferred LEMS to mice) caused significant immunostaining of mouse active zones: (1) the mean density (no./micron presynaptic membrane length) of positive active zones was 0.91 in the immunoferritin study and 0.72 in the immunoperoxidase study (control values, 0.12 and 0.02); and (2) 43% of the ferritin particles in the primary cleft were concentrated at the active zones and the rest were scattered randomly (control value, 5.3%). The findings indicate that LEMS IgG binds to the active zones of the presynaptic membrane.\r"

The kanamycin and streptomycin-spectinomycin resistances were not transferable to Camplylobacter sp. or to Escherichia coli, and no plasmid DNA was detected in this strain. The resistance genes were therefore tentatively assigned to a chromosomal locality. Analysis by the phosphocellulose paper-binding assay of extracts from BM2196 indicated that resistance to kanamycin and structurally related antibiotics was due to the synthesis of 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type I [APH(3')-I], an enzyme specific for gram-negative bacteria, and that resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin was secondary to the presence of a 3\",9-aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase. Homology between BM2196 and an APH(3')-I probe was detected by DNA-DNA hybridization. A 2.2-kilobase BM2196 DNA fragment conferring resistance to kanamycin was cloned in E. coli and was sequenced partially. The resistance gene appeared nearly identical to that of Tn903 from E. coli and was adjacent to IS15-delta, an insertion sequence widespread in gram-negative bacteria, thus indicating that Campylobacter species can act as a recipient for genes originating in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.\r"

  ".W": "Resistance to trimethoprim (Tp) is mediated by a plasmid-encoded gene in staphylococci. The gene is responsible for high-level resistance (MIC, greater than 1,000 micrograms/ml) in both its native host and when cloned on high-copy-number vectors in Escherichia coli. Analysis of subclones of the staphylococcal Tp gene on E. coli expression vectors and estimation of the size of full and truncated proteins produced in E. coli minicells generated an approximate size limit of 505 base pairs for the gene and 18,500 daltons for the gene product. Crude extracts of E. coli containing the cloned gene had dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) specific activity that was more than 100 times greater than that of control cells and more than 1,000 times more resistant to trimethoprim inhibition. The amount of trimethoprim required for a 50% reduction in the specific activity of staphylococcal DHFR differed from those of cells containing DHFR types I, II, or III, enzymes mediating Tp in members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. In addition, the size of the monomeric staphylococcal DHFR protein was larger than that of any of the gram-negative DHFRs both compared with published sequence data and as observed by direct comparison on polyacrylamide gels. Finally, there was no homology between a DNA fragment containing the cloned staphylococcal gene and DNA encoding any of the gram-negative DHFRs. Thus, the staphylococcal Tp gene codes for a single protein with DHFR activity that appears to be unrelated to DHFR genes that mediate Tp in members of the Enterobacteriaceae.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the U-937 monocytic cell line was examined. Acutely HIV-infected U-937 cells were exposed to GM-CSF (0.03, 0.3, 3.0, or 30.0 U/ml) and AZT (0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 microM) alone and in combination for 14 to 17 days. Reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatant, the percentage of cells expressing viral antigens by indirect immunofluorescence, and the 50% tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter of supernatant were determined to assess the level of viral replication in treated and control cultures. By the fractional-product method of analysis, nearly all combinations of GM-CSF and AZT synergistically inhibited HIV replication by these three measurements. The most effective combinations were 30 U of GM-CSF per ml with 0.1, 1.0, or 10.0 microM AZT. These treatments resulted in no reverse transcriptase activity in the supernatants, less than 1% immunofluorescent positive cells, and less than 8 50% tissue culture infectious doses per ml in the absence of cytotoxicity. Despite this degree of suppression, productive viral replication returned in all cultures within 4 to 10 days after drug removal. Combined therapy with GM-CSF and AZT merits consideration in the approach to HIV-associated illnesses.\r"

The compounds were also examined with respect to their interaction with Streptomyces strain R61 DD-carboxypeptidase. The alpha isomer of (2,3)-methylene penicillin G bound to PBP 3 of E. coli and other enterobacteria at 0.1 to 10 micrograms/ml. The beta isomer bound to PBP 3 at 100 micrograms/ml. Either isomer bound to PBPs 1b and 2 of E. coli only at 100 micrograms/ml. The alpha, but not the beta, isomer also bound to PBP 2 of S. aureus at 0.1 micrograms/ml. Binding studies with radiolabeled compounds indicated the binding to be covalent and revealed no additional binding proteins. (2,3)-Methylenepenams active against E. coli bound to PBP 3 and induced filamentation. The compounds also inhibited Streptomyces strain R61 DD-carboxypeptidase with apparent 50% inhibitory concentrations as low as 10(-7) M. The two (2,3)-methylene penicillin G isomers bound to the enzyme covalently, most likely at the same site as penicillin G since partial proteolysis after binding radiolabeled compounds produced similar peptide patterns. The bound beta isomer was released with a half-time similar to that of penicillin G (70 min at 30 degrees C), while the alpha isomer was released with a longer half-time (13 h at 30 degrees C). With either isomer, the major release product was phenylacetylglycine, suggesting C-5-C-6 cleavage.\r"

The susceptibility of about 1,200 clinical isolates to R-3746 was determined by the agar dilution method. Ninety percent or more of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus spp., Providencia rettgeri, and Haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations ranging less than or equal to 0.01 to 1.56 micrograms/ml. Furthermore, at a concentration of 3.13 micrograms/ml, 50% or more of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, and Serratia marcescens strains were also inhibited. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Xanthomonas maltophilia were resistant to R-3746. The activity of R-3746 was scarcely influenced by several growth conditions. R-3746 was highly resistant to hydrolysis by beta-lactamases derived from various species of bacteria. Killing-curve studies demonstrated bactericidal activity of R-3746 at concentrations above the MIC. R-3746 showed high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 1, 3, and 4 of Staphylococcus aureus and 1A, 1Bs, and 3 of Escherichia coli. Systemic infections in mice caused by various pathogens, including beta-lactamase-producing strains, responded well to therapy with oral doses of CS-807.\r"

The phospholipid/amino acid ratio was reduced in almost all OM preparations from antibiotic-treated bacteria. In one strain, antibiotic treatment increased the lipopolysaccharide/amino acid ratio. The amount of peptidoglycan fragments bound to the OM was increased by all the antibiotics. In pulse-chase experiments with a radioactive lipid precursor, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and aztreonam inhibited phospholipid translocation into the OM. Furthermore, imipenem, cephaloridine, and ciprofloxacin induced a pronounced reduction of the production of capsular K1 polysaccharide. Thus, antibiotics seem to induce marked changes of the quantitative composition of the cell envelope of E. coli. Possible connections of these data with findings on the influence of antibiotics on functional parameters of the host-parasite relationship such as OM immunogenicity and serum resistance are discussed.\r"

Of 47 evaluable episodes, 22 were treated with the teicoplanin regimen and 25 were treated with the combination of amikacin and ceftazidime. The overall response to therapy of patients treated with teicoplanin was slightly better (82% improvement) than that obtained with amikacin plus ceftazidime (52%). The response rate of patients with gram-positive bacteremias was 80% (4 of 5) to the regimen that included teicoplanin; 25% (1 of 4) of the patients treated with amikacin plus ceftazidime responded to treatment; and for patients with gram-negative bacteremias, the response rates were, respectively, 100% (4 of 4) and 70% (7 of 10). The better results obtained with amikacin-ceftazidime-teicoplanin treatment were most evident in patients with profound (less than 100/mm3) and persistent neutropenia (83 versus 30% improvement). Furthermore, a good response rate of patients with gram-positive bacteremias (seven of eight; 87% improvement) was achieved in a small group of bone marrow transplant patients who were all treated with amikacin-ceftazidime-teicoplanin. No severe side effects were documented in any patient. Teicoplanin, as a drug administered as a single daily dose, seems to be a safe and useful anti-gram-positive agent when used in combination with amikacin-ceftazidime as an empiric therapy of febrile episodes in granulocytopenic acute leukemia patients.\r"

Dermabrasion is helpful in specific situations in adjusting the level of the skin graft to the level of the edge of the recipient site. The greatest improvement was obtained from dermabrasion of elevated grafts located on the nose; however, patients having elevated grafts in all locations were more likely to have resolution of the elevation following dermabrasion than the control subjects. Control subjects experienced most of their improvement six months after the operation, but 27% of the elevated grafts continued to improve between six and 18 months. Grafts that were depressed six months after the grafting procedure remained depressed at 18 and 24 months regardless of whether dermabrasion was performed. In the additional time the subjects were followed up, no further improvement was noted beyond that achieved 12 months after dermabrasion. The data presented in this report and the conclusions drawn from these data may allow physicians to more carefully select subjects who will benefit from dermabrasion after skin grafting.\r"

The goal of research in this area is the synthesis of retinoids that would have a more favorable therapeutic: toxic ratio than retinol itself. A limiting factor in the use of any vitamin A analogue is that, even with a more favorable therapeutic: toxic ratio, large pharmacologic doses are required that produce side effects related to the drug's action in most individuals. With few exceptions, all of the side effects are those seen from mega-vitamin A ingestion, primarily affecting the mucocutaneous, skeletal, and central nervous systems. Most of the side effects from excess vitamin A are reversible, with notable exceptions being those involving hepatic and osseous tissues. In terms of reversibility from synthetic retinoids, the experience to date has been incomplete, so there remains imprecise information as to the incidence and the persistence of toxic effects after drug withdrawal.\r"

  ".W": "The intercellular spaces of the stratum corneum contain multilamellar lipid sheets derived from the extruded contents of lamellar granules. In the absence of linoleic acid, lamellar granules appear empty, and only fragmentary extracellular sheets are found. This defective differentiation is attributable to substitution of oleate for linoleate in O-acylsphingolipids. Normally, linoleate is ester-linked to 30- to 34-carbon omega-hydroxyacids, which, in turn, are amide-linked to sphingosine. Acylglucosylceramides, bearing a beta-D-glucosyl moiety on the sphingosine, may provide the driving force for lamellar granule assembly. The omega-hydroxyacyl chains are long enough to span a lipid bilayer, while the linoleate inserts into an adjacent bilayer. This interaction could promote assembly of lamellar granules. It has also been proposed that acylceramides may stabilize the extracellular sheets by a similar mechanism. In addition, the horny cell has been found to possess a covalently bound lipid envelope consisting principally of omega-hydroxyacylsphingosines derived from O-acylsphingolipids.\r"

Height was measured every three months for at least one year before and during treatment. Forty two patients responded to treatment with an increase in growth of greater than 1.5 cm/year. The remaining 12 who grew more slowly were less obviously short and had a higher pretreatment growth than those who responded. The three who responded and the one who did not had undergone therapeutic spinal irradiation before starting the drug. If a whole year's pretreatment growth rate of less than 5 cm/year had been used as a diagnostic criterion the prediction of those who responded would have slightly improved. About two thirds of the patients developed antibodies against growth hormone and Escherichia coli protein; these were, however, of low and fluctuating titre and binding capacity, and did not influence the response to treatment. No adverse side effects were encountered. We conclude that somatrem is a safe and effective alternative to pituitary growth hormone.\r"

Babies without respiratory difficulties showed no activity associated with respiration in these muscles. Grunting babies with respiratory disease showed pronounced activity during expiration. This activity continued when the babies were endotracheally intubated; if the babies were ventilated it sometimes disturbed the tidal ventilation delivered by the machines. When the baby expired during a ventilator inflation, so that gas came up the endotracheal tube against the inflating pressure, the abdominal oblique muscles contracted in 98% of the breaths.\r"

  ".W": "A clinical program in liver transplantation was begun at UCLA in 1984 after a period of laboratory investigation. The first 100 orthotopic liver transplants (OLT) were performed in 83 patients (43 adults and 40 children) between February 1, 1984 and November 1, 1986. Donors and recipients were matched only for size and ABO blood group compatibility, with OLT performed across blood groups in 28 patients. Standard operative techniques were used, including venous-venous bypass in adults. Arterial reconstruction was performed using an aortic Carrel patch or \"branch patch\" in 65% of cases and by end-to-end or aortic conduit techniques in the remainder. The hepatic artery thrombosis rate was 5%. Biliary reconstruction was choledochocholedochostomy in 67 OLT and Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy in 33 (complication rate of 24% and 24%, respectively). Average lengths and ranges of donor liver ischemia, operating time, and blood replacement were 4 hours (range: 1-10 hours), 7.6 hours (range: 4-15 hours), and 17 units packed cells (range: 2-220 units). Immunosuppressive regimen was cyclosporine-steroid combination, with monoclonal anti-T-cell antibody (OKT3) used for refractory rejection. All patients had one or more complications: pulmonary (78%), infectious (51%), renal dialysis (25%), neurologic (22%). All patients had at least one episode of acute rejection, and 3.6% had chronic rejection. Retransplantation was needed in nine patients once and in four patients twice. The overall retransplant survival rate was 54%, and two of four patients who received a second retransplant are alive. Sixty-three of the 83 patients (76%) are alive (adults 72%, children 80%). The 1- and 2-year actuarial survival rate is 73% (adults 68%, children 78%). Thirty-eight of 43 patients (88%) who had transplantation in the past year are alive. Of 14 perioperative variables assessed as predictors of early mortality, only postoperative dialysis (p less than 0.0005) and presence of severe rejection (p less than 0.01) had statistical significance. Seventy per cent of adults returned to work, and 84% of children had normal or accelerated growth. A new program in liver transplantation provides a dramatic option in patient care and an academic stimulus to the entire medical center.\r"

Two groups of age, sex, and weight-matched controls were studied under conditions of either acute (3 h, N = 7) or chronic (48-72 h, N = 6) hyperinsulinemia (46 +/- 4 microU/mL). The rate of glucose infusion (M = mg/kg/min) required to maintain steady-state euglycemia was taken as index of glucose utilization. M was higher both in postoperative patients and in chronic controls than in preoperative patients (2.1 +/- 0.1 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 1.0 +/- 0.2, p less than 0.01), yet never achieved levels seen in acute controls (3.3 +/- 0.3, p less than 0.01). Also reported is one subject who had a predominantly proinsulin-producing tumor with little insulin secretion, who also manifested a similar defect in glucose utilization. Excision of this tumor resulted in partial reversal of the peripheral defect in glucose metabolism. In conclusion, chronic endogenous hyperinsulinemia (and hyperproinsulinemia) in humans is associated with a defect in peripheral glucose utilization that is only partially resolved 2 years after tumor removal.\r"

  ".W": "The pathogenesis of hyperacute renal rejection consists of a nonspecific effector cascade that invokes most of the components of a typical acute inflammatory response. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) represents the most recent and perhaps the most significant mediator and promoting agent of this phenomenon. These studies evaluated SRI 63-441, a novel, synthetic, and the most potent PAF receptor antagonist available, alone and in combination with other prostanoids, for their ability to influence this response and to prolong renal xenograft survival and function in a model of pig-to-dog heterotransplantation. Inhibition of PAF by SRI 63-441 alone, at the dosage and schedule used in these experiments, did not significantly prolong xenograft survival or function. However, the combination of SRI 63-441 with either prostacyclin (PGI2) or prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) infusion demonstrated significant synergism, and resulted in a 6-9-fold increase in kidney survival and a 3-20-fold increase in urine output. Neither PGI2 nor PGE1 infusions alone significantly influenced this xenograft model. Electromagnetic flow studies demonstrated significantly delayed diminution in renal artery blood flow in the combination-treated animals. Serial and end-stage histologic examination of kidneys receiving combination therapy demonstrated a delayed onset of the pathologic deterioration and an overall amelioration of the entire process. These studies demonstrate that significant abrogation of a rapid and violent form of hyperacute rejection can be achieved solely by the pharmacologic manipulation of the inflammatory mediator response.\r"

This therapeutic approach resulted in a 57% long-term survival rate (follow-up: 14-48 months), which appears to be approximately three times superior to conventional chemotherapy in a comparable group of children. In addition, complete resection was possible in 11 of 17 patients operated on after induction therapy. Recurrence in the primary site after bone marrow transplantation occurred in only one of 18 evaluable patients. Thus, this approach almost always eradicates primary tumor in patients with neuroblastoma with advanced disease.\r"

  ".U": "88023061\r", 
  ".W": "A review of articles published since 1979 indicates that thrombotic and bleeding complications account for about 50% of valve-related complications in patients with bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valves and for approximately 75% of the complications in patients with mechanical valves. Although compromised by lack of standard definitions and by variability in reporting and follow-up, the data suggest that the linearized rate of both thrombotic and bleeding complications in patients with aortic bioprostheses is approximately half that for aortic mechanical prostheses (2% versus 4%), but is approximately equal for both bioprostheses and mechanical valves in the mitral position (approximately 4%), and for mechanical and bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valves in combination. However, linearized rates for fatal thrombotic and bleeding events are two to four times higher in patients with mechanical prostheses. The adequacy of warfarin anticoagulation is the most important factor affecting thrombotic and bleeding complications in patients with mechanical valves and over shadows the dubious importance of other phenomena such as atrial fibrillation and left atrial thrombus. Short-term warfarin anticoagulation or the use of long-term platelet inhibitors, or both, do not appear to reduce the incidence of thrombotic complications in patients with aortic bioprostheses but increase bleeding. For mitral bioprostheses, the postoperative use of warfarin for three months or aspirin indefinitely is as effective in preventing thromboembolism as long-term warfarin. Acute prosthetic valve endocarditis is associated with a 13 to 40% incidence of thrombotic complications. Likewise, the recurrence rate of cerebral emboli is high (20-30%) in patients with prosthetic valves who are not anticoagulated. Bioprostheses are strongly preferred for women who wish to bear children; fetal wastage occurs in 25 to 30% of pregnant women with mechanical heart valves who receive either warfarin or heparin, or a combination of the two. Heparin, however, greatly increases the risk of maternal bleeding. In children, the efficacy of platelet inhibitors without warfarin anticoagulation is unproven; nearly all serious strokes occur when warfarin is omitted; and permanent disability from warfarin-related bleeding is rare. All prosthetic cardiac valves initiate coagulation and affect the dynamic equilibrium between activated procoagulants and endogenous anticoagulants. Warfarin is the only available oral exogenous anticoagulant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

The present study was designed to monitor and quantify cardiac arrhythmias in obese subjects with and without eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy, who were matched with regard to arterial pressure, age, sex, and height with lean subjects. Prevalence of premature ventricular (but not atrial) contractions was 30 times higher in obese patients with eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy compared with lean subjects. Similarly, obese patients with left ventricular hypertrophy scored higher with regard to the classification of Lown and Wolf than those without left ventricular hypertrophy and lean subjects having the same level of arterial pressure. Patients' class in the Lown and Wolf system correlated with ventricular diastolic diameter and left ventricular mass. Thus, heart enlargement of the eccentric type as a consequence of obesity predisposes to excessive ventricular ectopy. Echocardiographic assessment and electrocardiographic monitoring allow us to identify the patients who are at highest risk of more serious arrhythmias or possibly sudden death and to subject them to the most specific preventive and therapeutic measures.\r"

Type II diabetic patients (N = 114) were treated in a behavioral weight control program and followed up for one year. Weight loss was significantly correlated with improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin values at posttreatment (r = .55) and one year (r = .51). Patients who lost more than 6.9 kg or had more than 5% reduction in body weight had significant improvements in glycosylated hemoglobin values at one year, while patients losing less weight had nonsignificant changes and those gaining weight had significant worsening. Thus, modest weight loss can have a long-term impact on glycemic control. However, the improvement in glycemic control for a given weight loss was greater initially than at one year, suggesting that energy restriction, in addition to weight loss, may contribute to initial improvement. Neither percent overweight nor diabetes treatment affected weight loss.\r"

The failure of cimetidine to offer any significant benefit under these protocol conditions reflects the fundamental difference in pathophysiologic features between classic acid-mediated ulcer disease and NSAID gastropathy.\r"

Autonomic dysfunction presented as incapacitating orthostatic hypotension and persisted for six weeks after amiodarone withdrawal. The pleuropulmonary toxic effects were reversible on discontinuation of amiodarone therapy, and resolution was hastened by short-course steroid treatment.\r"

Imipramine-treated patients reported the most and placebo patients the least number of adverse effects. Imipramine and alprazolam, but not diazepam, produced significantly more improvement in depressed symptomatology than did placebo. Mean diazepam scores frequently assumed an intermediate position between those of imipramine or alprazolam and placebo. These treatment differences were found to be independent of initial severity levels of anxiety and depression.\r"

The equilibrium dissociation affinity constant (Kd) did not change with any of the treatments. On reexamination one or two years after admission to the study, Bmax had not reached control values in clinically recovered, drug-free patients. Low pretreatment Bmax was associated with delusions during illness and with a poor long-term clinical outcome. There was no correlation between binding parameters and monoamine metabolite concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid, either before or during treatment.\r"

These results suggest that (1) from a familial perspective, early- and late-onset adult schizophrenia appear to be the same disorder, and (2) given that an individual will develop schizophrenia, familial factors, which may be genetic, influence the age at onset of the condition.\r"

Conventional methods include neutralization, complement fixation, hemagglutination-inhibition, indirect hemagglutination, and indirect immunofluorescence tests. Although these methods are reliable, each suffers from limitations that include procedural complexity, substantial \"hands-on\" time, need for titrating reagents and serially diluting specimens, occasional false-positive or false-negative results, and lack of interlaboratory standardization. Because of these problems, improved methods and new techniques for serologic diagnosis have been developed and investigated. Many appear to be superior to conventional methods in sensitivity, specificity, cost, time required for completion, and potential for automation. The advent of hybridoma technology has provided an exceptional opportunity to improve serologic reagents for the diagnosis of viral disease. In addition, IgM-specific antibody tests for rapid and early diagnosis of many viral infections are being reevaluated to eliminate the interfering effects of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies. Many of the new methodologies employ immunofluorescence assay or enzyme immunoassay for detection of specific IgM antibody, and latex agglutination, in addition to immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays, to detect specific IgG antibody. Simplified kits employing these methods are now becoming available commercially.\r"

However, several publications have reported difficulty in obtaining adequate LCA labeling in paraffin-embedded specimens. To assess this problem further, we applied an amplified version of the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex procedure to 315 formaldehyde-fixed hematopoietic malignancies, and 420 nonhematopoietic tumors that had been similarly processed. All non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were LCA-reactive with this method, whereas none of the nonhematopoietic neoplasms were stained. Twelve of 25 cases of Hodgkin's disease displayed LCA-positivity in Reed-Sternberg cells, but all contained reactive, benign inflammatory cells. Hence, the specificity of the amplified anti-LCA/avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique was 100%, and its sensitivity was 96%. This procedure should allow surgical pathologists to obtain reliable, reproducible staining of hematopoietic neoplasms in paraffin-embedded tissues.\r"

This normal distribution pattern may be altered in human liver in a variety of disorders, particularly in infectious and immune diseases. In view of multiple infections and severe immune alterations in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), we studied the expression of HLA class I and class II antigens in liver obtained at autopsy from ten patients with AIDS and eight control patients, using a panel of monoclonal antibodies and the indirect immunofluorescence method. In spite of viral bacterial, and fungal infections, HLA class I antigens were detected on hepatocytes in only two patients with AIDS. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were found unexpectedly on bile duct epithelium in five of ten patients with AIDS and in one of eight control patients. The aberrant HLA class II antigen expression on bile ducts does not appear to be linked to bile duct damage or infection with cytomegalovirus or other agents, but may be related to immune alterations in patients with AIDS.\r"

Some preliminary conclusions were reached: (1) about half of all subjects studied still hold a valid driver's license; (2) brain-damaged drivers could not, in general, be seen as risky drivers, although some individuals show decreased driving skill and risky behavior in traffic; and (3) statistics show no increase in traffic violations or accidents in groups of neurologic patients with acquired brain lesions or diseases. Frequently noted problems of brain-damaged drivers include poor judgment of traffic situations, impulsivity, and visuospatial impairments. Traditional psychologic tests have insufficient predictive value regarding fitness to drive. It is suggested that new techniques be developed to enable more valid statements about the skills needed for safe traffic participation. These assessment techniques should emphasize the higher cognitive levels in driving, ie, the tactical and strategic levels. At the moment, driver training programs in rehabilitation focus mainly on the operational level, with emphasis on handling the car, use of controls and mirrors, and technical adaptation of the vehicle.\r"

Twenty-four of 25 patients had a response to OKT3, which was complete in 14 and partial in ten. With a mean follow-up of 8.2 months, allograft salvage has been 80% and patient survival 88%; two patients underwent successful retransplantation. Side effects have been mild and well tolerated. Repeated rejection has occurred in 40% of patients, but these episodes have responded to steroid therapy.

The corneal endothelium appeared to expand beneath the dying endothelial cells, indicating reendothelialization of the cornea. There was no epithelialization of the endothelium, as evidenced by the lack of keratin production or desmosome formation. Descemet's membrane was thickened with edema, a posterior collagenous layer, and fibrous, long-spacing collagen. These alterations in Descemet's membrane were similar to those described for other corneal dystrophies. It is proposed that this unilateral desquamating endotheliopathy represents an incipient form or a forme fruste of the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome.\r"

The average reduction in tumor thickness was 46%. Visual acuity remained within two Snellen lines of preoperative levels in 14 (54%) of the 26 patients. Of the 12 patients who lost more than two lines of central visual acuity, eight developed radiation changes affecting either the optic nerve or retina, and three developed cataracts; enucleation accounted for the loss of vision in the final patient. Enucleation was necessary in one other patient in this series because of tumor growth. The mean duration between treatment with iodine 125 and the development of radiation changes affecting the optic nerve or retina was 32 months.\r"

Evidence indicates that the PMN response to such activators may be modified by factors present at the sites of inflammation. We have evaluated the effects of a low molecular weight factor present in synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients on Fc receptor-mediated PMN degranulation and phagocytosis. Synovial fluid samples from 11 RA patients were studied; 10 of them contained factor(s) which augmented phagocytosis and degranulation mediated through the Fc receptor. This factor(s) alone, however, did not initiate neutrophil degranulation: its MW is less than 10,000 daltons and it is unstable when heated to 56 degrees C. We also examined supernatants that were produced by coculturing adherent human mononuclear cells stimulated by IgG-coated sheep red blood cells with autologous nonadherent mononuclear cells. A factor(s) with properties similar to those found in the synovial fluids (i.e., heat-labile at 56 degrees C and capable of augmenting Fc receptor-mediated degranulation and phagocytosis) was found in the stimulated human mononuclear cell culture supernatants. Filtration studies indicated that the MW of this factor(s) is between 2,000 and 10,000 daltons. No such activity was detected in culture supernatants of unstimulated mononuclear cells. Production of the cytokine was blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that protein synthesis was necessary. This factor(s), by enhancing PMN degranulation, may augment PMN-mediated tissue destruction in diseases such as RA.\r"

Outcome was compared using degree of active abduction, pain, limitation of function, and a clinical index that combined equally weighted measures of all of these. In a time-adjusted analysis, triamcinolone was superior to placebo in all clinical variables. Naproxen was superior to placebo in all variables except pain. Triamcinolone was superior to naproxen in the relief of pain (P = 0.04) and the clinical index (P = 0.04). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that naproxen and triamcinolone treatment accounted for only 16% of the variation in outcome, compared with 44% accounted for by the clinical index prior to treatment. Thus, patients with a poor pretreatment clinical index (those with the most room for improvement) were least likely to improve. We conclude that both triamcinolone (P = 0.00005) and naproxen (P = 0.02) are superior to placebo in the treatment of the painful shoulder.\r"

  ".W": "A review of the history of our knowledge and understanding of the peripheral oedema of congestive cardiac failure points to the conclusion that an inability of the heart to maintain the arterial pressure is of central importance in this condition. Although the function of the circulation is to perfuse the tissues, the body monitors the adequacy of its perfusion, not not through metabolic messengers carried from the tissues in the blood stream, but by sensing the arterial pressure; and the mechanisms evoked act to maintain the arterial pressure. In the short term this is achieved by autonomic regulation of the heart and blood vessels; in the longer term the arterial pressure is maintained through an increase in the blood volume by a retention of salt and water by the kidney. To support the latter process, intrinsic renal mechanisms are successively magnified by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and by the activities of the sympathetic system and vasopressin. The natriuretic influence mediated through volume receptors and the release of atrial peptide is overruled by the arterial baroreceptors, so that the body maintains the arterial pressure at the expense of an increase in blood volume. In these ways the syndrome of congestive cardiac failure may be regarded as one which arises when the heart becomes chronically unable to maintain an appropriate arterial pressure without support.\r"

The results were compared with values for 20 patients with untreated essential hypertension matched for height, weight, age, and sex. Total body potassium alone was also measured in 20 normal subjects also matched for anthropomorphic measurements. Patients with hypertension had a very similar total body potassium content to that of normal subjects, but patients with heart failure had significantly reduced total body potassium. This could not be explained by muscle wasting because total body nitrogen, largely present in muscle tissue, was well maintained. When total body potassium was expressed as a ratio of potassium to nitrogen mass a consistent depletion of potassium was revealed in the group with heart failure. Potassium depletion was poorly related to diuretic dose, severity of heart failure, age, or renal function. Activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was, however, related to hypokalaemia and potassium depletion. Such patients also had significantly lower concentrations of serum sodium and blood pressure. Serum potassium was related directly to total body potassium. Despite the absence of clinically apparent oedema total body chlorine was not consistently increased in heart failure, but the calculated extracellular fluid volume remained expanded in the heart failure group. Total body sodium was significantly increased in patients with heart failure, but less than half of this increase could be accounted for by extracellular fluid volume expansion. Potassium depletion in heart failure may account in part for the high frequency of arrhythmias and sudden death in this condition.\r"

At 1 year following surgery, the mortality was 20.4%. Increasing age, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, preoperative arrhythmias and poor ASA status were all associated with increases in early and long term mortality. A delay to surgery of more than 24 h from admission was also associated with an increased 28-day mortality. Senile dementia and admission other than from the patient's own home, were factors associated with a poorer long term outcome. From the point of view of mortality, subarachnoid anaesthesia did not appear to confer any advantages over general anaesthesia in non-prosthetic surgery for hip fracture in the elderly.\r"

In 4 of 58 normal patients examined before 20 weeks, diastolic flow was absent in some part of the recording. In 34 fetuses with congenital heart disease detected at between 18 and 37 weeks gestation, 10 were found consistently to have associated absent diastolic flow. Five of these fetuses died in utero between 5 and 21 days after the recording; three were aborted and the remaining two died in the neonatal period at 4 and 7 days after the examination. Fetal congenital heart disease with normal umbilical blood flow also had a poor prognosis in general, but the adverse outcome was much less immediate than in fetuses with absent diastolic flow. No correlation was found between the type of congenital heart disease and the characteristics of the umbilical artery waveform. Absent diastolic flow in the umbilical artery indicates a poor short-term prognosis for fetuses with congenital heart disease, particularly after 20 weeks, when fetal death is predictable.\r"

One woman in this group required hysterectomy for haemorrhage after an emergency caesarean section. Planned caesarean sections were carried out in 125 cases (40%). Trial of vaginal delivery was abandoned in 59 (40%) of the 149 women where this was attempted. Epidural analgesia appears to increase the duration of the second stage of labour in those who were delivered vaginally.

Thereafter, there was a trend to decreasing pH and increasing base deficit with increasing length of second stage in the dorsal group, but not in the tilt group though this did not reach statistical significance. Low Apgar scores, complicated pregnancy and first pregnancy were each associated with significantly lower pH levels.

The 216 women with an abnormal 100 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) using NDDG criteria were subjected to a 75 g OGTT. Using the WHO criteria, 111 women (51%) had NGT, 98 (45%) had IGT and 7 (3%) had frank diabetes mellitus. Those with NGT and IGT were randomized into control and treatment groups. The perinatal outcome in these two groups was comparable whether the NGT and IGT groups were analysed together or separately except, that in those who were treated for IGT, smaller babies were born one week earlier than in the control group (3407 g vs 3110 g, P less than 0.01). This suggests that the WHO criteria can safely replace the 100 g OGTT with substantial savings in manpower, money and patients' time.\r"

Fetal breathing movements (FBM) were absent in 17 patients, all of whom were delivered within 56 h. FBM were present in 47 patients of whom five were delivered within 56 h from examination and four of these had spontaneous rupture of membranes and/or chorioamnionitis. In 33 the pregnancy continued for at least 1 week. Two of the fetuses with false negative results showed a distinct breathing pattern different from the rest of the study group. This suggests that pattern recognition of fetal breathing might improve the specificity of this investigation.\r"

Of the 12 CIN studied, six were positive for both Leu-7 and Leu-11 staining and three were positive for Leu-11 alone. NK cells were found predominantly in the subepithelial stroma. The frequency and pattern of distribution of these cells were similar in all grades of CIN. The number of NK cells present was usually small but the degree of infiltration by Leu-11 positive cells was pronounced in two HPV infections and in one CIN 1. NK cells may have a role in surveillance against HPV infection and the development and progression of CIN.\r"

If a monoclonal antibody specific for melanoma could be identified, it might be radiolabelled to provide a scanning technique which could distinguish between an ocular melanoma and a similar lesion. This pilot, in vitro study was undertaken to determine if monoclonal antibody against cutaneous melanoma recognises any antigenic similarity in ocular melanomas. Three cutaneous melanoma MoAbs 225.28S, 376.96S, and 763-24T and a non-specific MoAb HMFG2 were studied. Cell impressions were obtained from fresh ocular malignant melanomas. Standard staining techniques with immunofluorescence were used. MoAb 225.28S, 376.96S, and 763.24T were positive in melanomas with a dominant epithelioid cell type and in those with a dominant spindle cell type. It is concluded that MoAb 225.28S, 376.96S, and 763.24T may be suitable for imaging ocular melanomas after labelling with 123I, 111In, or 99mTc.\r"

Low levels have been reported in association with malignancy but also in healthy nonpregnant individuals. By indirect immunofluorescence, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and immunoprecipitation we here demonstrate the presence of SP1 both on the surface and in the cytoplasm of human granulocytes but not in earlier myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow. Lymphocytes did not contain the protein, and only trace amounts could be found in the cytoplasm of blood monocytes. A major glycoprotein with an apparent mol wt of 90,000 was obtained by immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled granulocytes. Cultivated blood monocytes, while adhering to surfaces or forming multinuclear giant cells, displayed a strong membrane and cytoplasmic expression of SP1. Treatment of the myeloid leukemia cell line ML-2 with tetraphorbol acetate (TPA) strongly induced SP1 in the membrane and cytoplasm as revealed by immunofluorescence and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of immunoprecipitates from lysates of surface radiolabeled cells. The induction of synthesis of SP1 in TPA-treated cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation from lysates of cells metabolically labeled with 35S-methionine. Human lymphoblastoid and erythroleukemic cell lines did not express SP1 either before or after induced differentiation. Thus SP1 provides a late differentiation marker for the myelomonocytic lineage and is strongly induced during macrophage differentiation or by TPA treatment of ML-2 cells.\r"

All recipients were previously transfused. Comparison of post-bone marrow transplantation events in adults and children reveals equivalent median time to engraftment, median duration of hospitalization, median Karnofsky assessment of activity, and equivalent low rejection rate. Although the incidence of moderate and severe acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) and of extensive chronic GVHD was greater in adults than in children, the projected survival at 4 years of adults (67%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 49% to 85%) and of children (73%; 95% CI 57% to 89%) was equivalent. All survivors are transfusion-free and have normal peripheral blood counts. One of 28 adults and 2 of 30 children have experienced rejection, and 1 of these patients survives after a second transplant. No malignancies have been identified following transplantation. An unexpectedly high incidence of hypothyroidism has been detected and may be attributable to preparation of recipients with TLI. Therapy of severe aplastic anemia with allogeneic BMT after preparation with cyclophosphamide and TLI offers a high rate of transfusion-free survival and a low rejection rate in previously transfused young adults and children.\r"

Twenty-four of the 29 mixed chimeras (83%) have remained in continuous complete remission for up to 116 months (greater than 9 years) following BMT. Four of the 29 patients (14%) have had recurrent leukemia, and 7 of the 29 (24%) have had moderate or severe graft-v-host disease (GVHD). Twelve of these 29 patients have persisted as stable mixed chimeras for greater than or equal to 2 years after BMT, whereas other patients converted to all donor-type hematopoiesis. The incidence of mixed chimerism was independent of the pretransplant regimen, the donor or recipient age (less than 20 v greater than 20 years), remission status (first complete remission of acute leukemia and first chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia v later stages of disease), and type of leukemia. Our data indicate that mixed hematopoietic chimerism is not rare after BMT for hematologic malignancies and that its presence is compatible with long-term disease-free survival. Prospective studies of mixed chimerism after BMT are warranted to achieve better understanding of its biologic importance.\r"

  ".W": "The genetic sequences encoding the gibbon and human interleukin 3 (IL 3) proteins were molecularly cloned. The amino acid sequence of the mature gibbon IL 3 protein proved to share 93% homology with the corresponding human protein. We examined the effects of biosynthetic (recombinant) gibbon IL 3 on the proliferation and differentiation of an enriched population of human hematopoietic progenitors and compared the results with the effects of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Gibbon IL 3 supported the formation of various types of single lineage as well as multilineage colonies by My-10+ bone marrow cells in the presence of human erythropoietin (Ep). In contrast, recombinant human GM-CSF supported the formation of single-lineage colonies and only a small number of multilineage colonies. Both IL 3 and GM-CSF had significant erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA). Delayed addition of gibbon IL 3 to low serum culture of My-10+ marrow cells supported the formation of blast cell colonies with variable but high replating capability. Human GM-CSF was less effective than IL 3 in support of multipotential blast cell colonies. These results are analogous to the effects of murine IL 3 and GM-CSF on murine progenitors and support the notion that the primary factor for multipotential progenitors is IL 3.\r"

A standard risk group of 20 patients included those with acute leukemia in remission and CML in chronic phase. A high-risk group of 30 patients included individuals with refractory acute leukemia, acute leukemia in relapse, acute leukemia following preleukemia, and CML in accelerated and blastic phase. Complete remission and sustained complete engraftment were achieved in all evaluable patients. The duration of aplasia was remarkably short (median of 8 days), resulting in a low infection rate during the period of neutropenia, a reduced need for blood product support, and a short length of hospital stay. Three-year actuarial relapse-free survival in both standard-risk (88.9% +/- 10.5%) and high-risk (50.5% +/- 9.6%) groups compares favorably with that reported with total body irradiation (TBI) containing regimens.\r"

  ".W": "Multilineage and single-lineage hemopoietic precursors were studied in 102 bone marrow transplant recipients and their respective donors to determine their contribution to clinical outcome as measured by time to engraftment and survival. The patient population was heterogenous with respect to diagnosis and disease status. They included individuals with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aplastic anemia, and a few other hematopoietic malignancies. The frequency of various clonogenic precursors in the normal donor population varied considerably. The data yielded a symmetrical distribution. In contrast, most bone marrow transplant recipients presented with significantly reduced numbers of clonogenic cells before transplantation, resulting in skewed distribution profiles. Serial studies of recipients demonstrated a significantly lower than normal level of clonogenic precursors even 3 and 4 years after transplantation. The median values and distribution profiles approximated those observed before transplantation but did not return to measurements obtained for normal donors. Patients with ALL deviated from this pattern. The median values and distribution profiles of clonogenic precursors before transplantation approximated the pattern of normal donors. The frequency of clonogenic progenitors after transplantation, however, remained significantly lower than that of their respective donor or pretransplant values. Cell cycle studies performed after normalization of peripheral blood hematopoietic parameters demonstrated for most recipients that a higher than normal proportion of multipotent cells was in S-phase (P = .011). By univariate and multivariate approaches, clonogenic precursors and clinical parameters were assessed for their contributions to clinical outcome as measured by time to engraftment and survival time. The number of nucleated cells in the transplant inoculum contributed to survival independent of other risk factors. Patients with a higher cell load had a higher probability of surviving than did patients with a lower cell concentration in the transplant inoculum (P = .042). The frequency of clonogenic precursors in the transplant inoculum altered neither survival nor time to engraftment. The time to engraftment was significantly influenced by the frequency of clonogenic megakaryocyte precursors (CFU-M) observed in recipients prior to transplantation (P = .003). Patients with high values engrafted faster than did patients with a low frequency of CFU-M. This was independent of both diagnosis and disease status of the patients at time of transplantation.\r"

Increasing the concentration of nucleated bone marrow cells in the incubation mixture also decreased the 4HC activity. Evaluation of 53 consecutive patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) revealed that the incubation RBC concentration during clinical purging showed a similar effect on CFU-GM recovery. Aldehyde dehydrogenase content of RBCs and nucleated marrow cells appears to be the cause of the inhibition of 4HC activity. Although there was no difference in individual CFU-GM sensitivity to 4HC among normals, previously treated patients undergoing autologous BMT showed significant variability in CFU-GM sensitivity to 4HC. The combined effects of incubation RBC concentration and individual patient 4HC sensitivity appear to account for most of the variability in CFU-GM recovery and speed of hematologic recovery after clinical purging with 4HC.\r"

  ".W": "Alloimmunization to donor class I HLA antigens represents a major obstacle to successful platelet transfusion therapy. It is desirable to distinguish alloimmunization from nonimmunologic causes of poor platelet survival to assess the need for HLA-matched, single-donor platelets. We describe a new in vitro assay for anti-HLA antibodies and report its application to the problem of platelet crossmatching. In contrast to previously described crossmatch techniques, the immunobead assay is specific for anti-HLA antibodies. The assay was used to evaluate 51 single-donor platelet transfusions given to seven patients from 35 different donors. Recipient plasma was assayed for antibodies directed against HLA antigens present on donor platelets. A one-hour posttransfusion corrected count increment of greater than or equal to 7,500 was considered a successful outcome. Twenty-nine of 33 (87.9%) transfusion episodes associated with a negative immunobead assay had successful outcomes. The four unsuccessful transfusions were associated with potential nonimmunologic causes of poor platelet survival. Only two of 18 (11.1%) episodes associated with a positive assay had successful outcomes. Only one unsuccessful transfusion episode was associated with a negative immunobead assay and a positive radiolabeled antiglobulin test result, which suggested that isolated alloantibodies to antigens other than class I HLA antigens are not a common cause of platelet refractoriness. Platelets stored in suspension at 4 degrees C or frozen in liquid nitrogen were found suitable for crossmatch testing.\r"

In CML, the molecular events resulting from the Ph translocation include a break within the bcr locus on chromosome 22, transfer of the c-abl protooncogene from chromosome 9 to 22, and formation of an aberrant 210-kD bcr-abl fusion protein (p210bcr-abl). Recently, the absence of bcr rearrangement and expression of a distinct aberrant 190-kd abl protein (p190c-abl) has been described in Ph-positive ALL, with the suggestion that the two abl variants may be pathogenetically associated with myeloid v lymphoid leukemogenesis. Here we report that the genomic configuration and translation product of Ph-positive AML can be similar to that of Ph-positive ALL: the break at 22q11 may occur outside the 5.8 kb bcr region and result in expression of a 190-kD abl protein lacking these bcr sequences. Phosphokinase enzymatic activity, a fundamental property of p210bcr-abl, was also associated with AML-derived p190c-abl. Our current observations indicate that p190c-abl can be found in cells of lymphoid or myeloid lineage and is therefore unlikely to play a specific role in the development of lymphoid leukemias. Formation of p190c-abl instead of p210bcr-abl appears to be a characteristic of the acute rather than the chronic Ph-positive leukemic state.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to produce and respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) was evaluated in 50 recipients of HLA-identical bone marrow (BM) depleted of mature T cells by soybean agglutination and E rosetting (SBA-E-BM). In contrast to our previous findings in recipients of unfractionated marrow, during weeks 3 to 7 post-SBA-E-BM transplantation (BMT), PBMC from the majority of patients spontaneously released IL-2 into the culture medium. This IL-2 was not produced by Leu-11+ natural killer cells, which were found to be predominant in the circulation at this time, but by T11+, T3+, Ia antigen-bearing T cells. The IL-2 production could be enhanced by coculture with host PBMC frozen before transplant but not by stimulation with mitogenic amounts of OKT3 antibody, thus suggesting an in vivo activation of donor T cells or their precursors by host tissue. Spontaneous IL-2 production was inversely proportional to the number of circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes and ceased after 7 to 8 weeks post-SBA-E-BMT in most of the patients. In patients whose cells had ceased to produce IL-2 spontaneously or never produced this cytokine, neither coculture with host cells nor stimulation with OKT3 antibody thereafter induced IL-2 release through the first year posttransplant. Proliferative responses to exogenous IL-2 after stimulation with OKT3 antibody remained abnormal for up to 6 months post-SBA-E-BMT, unlike the responses of PBMC from recipients of conventional BM, which responded normally by 1 month post-BMT. However, the upregulation of IL-2 receptor expression by exogenous IL-2 was found to be comparable to normal controls when tested as early as 3 weeks post-SBA-E-BMT. Therefore, the immunologic recovery of proliferative responses to IL-2 and the appearance of cells regulating in vivo activation of T cells appear to be more delayed in patients receiving T cell-depleted BMT. Similar to patients receiving conventional BMT, however, the ability to produce IL-2 after mitogenic stimulation remains depressed for up to 1 year after transplantation.\r"

  ".U": "88025596\r", 
  ".W": "A novel cell line, FL-18, was established from the pleural effusion of a patient with follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma. At the same time, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA)-positive cell line, FL-18-EB, was established from the EBV-infected culture of the same pleural effusion cells. Both cell lines had the same monoclonal surface immunoglobulin (IgG kappa), and they had the same karyotype as that of the fresh pleural effusion cells in which a reciprocal translocation between the long arm of chromosomes 14 and 18 [t(14;18)(q32;q21)] was detected. Gene rearrangement analysis of immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (JH) and kappa light-chain gene (J kappa) showed the same rearranged configuration in the two cell lines; however, some morphological and phenotypic differences were found. The FL-18-EB cells, which were morphologically similar to common EBNA-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines of normal B cell origin at the initial phase of culture, were larger than the FL-18 cells and contained multinucleated giant cells. The FL-18 cells lacked cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and were positive for common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA), whereas the FL-18-EB cells had cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and were negative for CALLA. Thus, the phenotype of FL-18-EB seems to be a result of a shift by EBV infection to a more mature stage in the B cell differentiation pathway than that of FL-18. The paired availability of EBV-free and EBV-infected cell lines of a neoplastic clone is unique and valuable in considering EBV infectibility of neoplastic B cells and resultant phenotypic changes.\r"

To determine whether CALLA/CD10-positive and -negative neutrophils have similar or distinct functional attributes, we sorted normal peripheral blood neutrophils for CALLA/CD10 expression and compared their chemotactic ability. Surprisingly, the low-frequency (approximately 5%), CALLA/CD10-negative neutrophils displayed a dramatically heightened chemotactic response to activated complement (C') that was (a) specific for C', (b) not observed with other minor subpopulations of neutrophils, (c) not due to previous activation in vivo or in vitro, and (d) apparently not due to an increase in C5a receptors. These results underscore the concept of neutrophil heterogeneity and prompt the hypothesis that CALLA/CD10-negative neutrophils may participate in an inflammatory response to trauma involving complement activation.\r"

This mosaicism was observed before graft failure or relapse in six patients. However, in five other patients, this mixed chimerism was not followed by these complications with a follow-up of 9 to 31 months after transplantation. Our results support the hypothesis that transplanted bone marrow T cells may help to maintain engraftment by eliminating host cells that can cause graft failure.\r"

  ".W": "The regulatory function of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) on granulocyte production in vivo was evaluated in an autologous bone marrow transplantation model using rhesus monkeys. Monkeys were exposed to 9.0 Gy total body irradiation and then transplanted with 5.0 x 10(7) low-density bone marrow cells/kg. Alzet miniosmotic pumps were subcutaneously implanted to deliver rhGM-CSF at a rate of 50,400 U/kg/d. Minipumps, containing either rhGM-CSF or saline, were implanted between zero and five days after transplantation for seven days. Kinetic recoveries of peripheral blood cells after either saline or rhGM-CSF treatment were compared. Treatment with rhGM-CSF accelerated the recovery of neutrophils. Neutrophils in rhGM-CSF-treated animals recovered to 80% (3.4 x 10(3)/mm3) pre-irradiation control levels by day 20, in comparison with only 33% (0.9 x 10(3)/mm3) recovery for saline control monkeys. In addition, the recovery of neutrophils was enhanced over that of the controls, reaching 140% v 70% on day 30. Another prominent feature of rhGM-CSF-treated monkeys was the accelerated recovery of platelets, reaching near 50% normal levels by day 24 in comparison with 20% of normal levels for controls. The infusion of rhGM-CSF was shown to be an effective regulator of early hematopoietic regeneration, leading to the accelerated recovery of both neutrophils and platelets and then providing a consistent sustained increase of neutrophils even in the absence of rhGM-CSF.\r"

A comprehensive survey revealed a significantly higher carriage rate of Clostridium perfringens in the RA population (88%) than controls (48%) (p less than 0.01). Coliform counts also tended to be higher, but there were no other significant differences between patients and controls. When the study was enlarged to include a further 113 RA patients with variable disease activity and a further 38 controls, clostridia were again more frequently carried by those with RA (70%) than controls (45%) (p less than 0.01) and clostridial counts were significantly higher in the patient group (p = 0.006). Moreover, counts in patients with active or moderately active disease were significantly higher than in those with inactive disease (p less than 0.001). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that Cl. perfringens plays a role in triggering or is otherwise associated with disease activity in RA. The findings may be alternatively an effect of the disease or its treatment with, for example, anti-inflammatory drugs.\r"

In the SASP-treated group this was accompanied by significant falls in counts of Cl. perfringens and E. coli. No such changes were seen in the DPA-treated group.

The usual appearance is of a thin, echogenic, linear structure running from the renal sinus to the cortex in an antero-superior direction. It is believed to originate from a layer of connective tissue which is trapped when a proportion of kidneys form from the fusion of two metanephric elements. The PJL is a common ultrasonic finding in a normal child's kidney and should never be confused with a pyelonephritic scar.\r"

However, interpretation of the results is often difficult due to noise in the antibody and subtraction images. By performing a linear, least-squares fit to all the pixel values, it is possible to calculate the \"prediction interval\". This may be used as a variable threshold for the subtracted image to leave only statistically significant counts. The method has been evaluated in models and found to be independent of count density and image processing. Useful results have been obtained in initial patient studies. The technique is fast and objective, and therefore it may have a useful role in the routine analysis of subtracted images.\r"

Subsequent discriminant function analysis demonstrated the importance of a small number of features whose presence could be used in an algorithm to predict diagnostic outcome. Using this algorithm, this feature-identification approach correctly identified 87.6% of benign and 79% of malignant cases. Specificity was improved to 88% as compared with the original radiological diagnosis of 49%. It is argued that this approach is very promising and a computer-assisted diagnosis based on these findings is described.\r"

The other two studies were designed to investigate the action of the drug on vesicosphincteric dynamics. These were double-blind, controlled, parallel trials, one comparing bromocriptine at dosages of 2.5 and 5 mg with placebo 90 min after administration, and the other comparing bromocriptine 5 mg/day with placebo after 15 days' administration in post-prostatectomy patients. Bromocriptine had a favourable effect on patients with BPH but no effect on cases of acute retention. The urodynamic studies suggested that the drug affected urethral sphincteric mechanisms specifically. The weight and volume of the prostate remained unchanged after administration of the drug, so that any clinical response was not due to a direct effect on the gland itself.\r"

  ".W": "Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) has been proposed as a specific therapy for acute pancreatitis. Reduced mortality encountered in an uncontrolled clinical study and a controlled experimental study may be attributable to replenishment by FFP of the naturally occurring antiprotease system. To investigate this potential therapy further, 202 patients presenting with acute pancreatitis were randomized to receive FFP (2 units daily for 3 days) or a similar volume of colloid control as part of their intravenous fluid therapy. Clinical progress was monitored and the major serum antiproteases (alpha 1-antiprotease and alpha 2-macroglobulin) were measured on days 1, 3 and 7. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of clinical outcome. alpha 1-Antiprotease levels rose significantly from day 1 to day 3 in both groups (P less than 0.0001) and remained elevated at day 7. alpha 1-Antiprotease is an acute phase protein in man and raised serum levels would be anticipated. FFP appears to have no effect on the magnitude of this rise. Serum alpha 2-macroglobulin levels were reduced in both groups on day 1 and continued to fall significantly from day 1 to day 3 in the colloid control group (P less than 0.005) whilst remaining substantially unaltered in patients receiving FFP (P = 0.6527). alpha 2-Macroglobulin plays a central role in the elimination of proteases during acute pancreatitis and the ability of relatively low volumes of FFP to reduce the fall in serum alpha 2-macroglobulin levels seen during the early stages of this disease may have therapeutic implications.\r"

  ".W": "The results of 600 consecutive renal transplant operations (540 cadaver and 60 living related donor) in 491 patients were assessed with respect to urological complications. In nearly all cases the ureter was inserted into the bladder using a Leadbetter-Politano ureteroneocystostomy technique. The bladder was drained by Foley catheter for 5 days and the operation site by vacuum drain for a variable period. After 26 operations in 26 patients, 27 episodes of ureteric obstruction were identified (one reobstruction). These occurred between 1 day and 45 months after transplantation and involved the lowest third of the ureter 19 times, the middle third 3 times and the proximal third 4 times. They were due to stricture (11), pelvic collection (7), redundant or twisted ureter (3) or other cause (5). An anatomical predisposing factor in either patient or graft was identified in 31 per cent of these caes. After 18 operations in 18 patients, 21 episodes of urine leakage were identified (three re-leakages). These occurred between 1 day and 6 months after transplantation and an anatomical predisposing factor in either patient or graft was present in 59 per cent. Thus, overall, 7 per cent of patients developed a urological complication in this series. This rate has declined in recent years in parallel with a general reduction in steroid dose for immunosuppression. This last feature, combined with the surgical technique described, has resulted in a low incidence of urological complication after transplantation, being now between 1 and 2 per cent.\r"

Four patients died (two of stroke, two of myocardial infarction) and four survivors had recurrent ipsilateral symptoms. Two had an immediate mild hemiparesis which recovered completely within 36 h; in both, the endarterectomized arteries were patent on scanning. The other two experienced amaurosis fugax for 2-3 weeks at 2 and 24 weeks; scanning showed that the sites of both endarterectomies had become occluded. Ultrasound assessment at 2 weeks showed that 43 of 61 (70.5 per cent) endarterectomized arteries were widely patent. There were three occlusions, one stenosis of greater than 75 per cent, three stenoses of greater than 50 per cent and eleven stenoses of less than 50 per cent. At 6 months a total of five vessels were occluded, with greater than 75 per cent stenosis in three and greater than 50 per cent stenosis in eight. At latest follow-up, six of eight arteries with greater than 50 per cent stenosis shown earlier had scans which had reverted to normal. Tacking down of the distal intima was associated with higher incidence of restenosis and occlusion (P less than 0.01). Women were more predisposed to restenosis by neointimal hyperplasia (P less than 0.05). All restenosis occurred within the first 6 months postoperatively (26.2 per cent) and fell to 16.4 per cent at the end of the study.\r"

A subgroup of 69 patients aged 50 or above in whom emergency endoscopy showed non-arterial bleeding or signs of recent haemorrhage without a visible vessel entered a prospective therapeutic trial. The patients were randomized to receive either (1) early surgery, implying immediate operation, or (2) expectant management, with surgery reserved only for patients with further haemorrhage. The two groups were homogeneous with respect to age, sex, prior ingestion of ulcerogenic drugs, mode of bleeding, admission haematocrit, number with hypovolaemic shock and number with active bleeding on initial endoscopy. Overall mortality was 8.6 per cent. Mortality in patients submitted to early surgery was five times higher than that in those allocated to expectant therapy (14.7 per cent versus 2.9 per cent; risk ratio 5.07). The results suggest that expectant management is advisable in patients with bleeding duodenal ulcer not bleeding massively and in whom endoscopy does not disclose spurting arterial bleeding or a visible vessel.\r"

Follow-up of surviving patients for at least one year showed no difference in incisional hernia rate between the two groups of patients. No problems were encountered in making the incisions through the umbilicus, but skirting the umbilicus was felt to cause problems with slewing of the scalpel blade, and asymmetry of the scar in 13 circumumbilical incisions. This study has shown that the practice of avoiding the umbilicus in midline abdominal surgery serves no useful purpose.\r"

Macrophages in reactive proliferation, histiocytosis X, and neoplastic proliferation gave positive reaction for IAP. Diffuse cytoplasmic staining was usual, but dot-like or globular and surface staining also were observed. Proliferating cells in malignant fibrous histiocytoma were more sensitively stained by IAP than by other ordinary used markers for macrophage. These findings provide useful information to understand the mechanism of elevation of serum IAP in cancer patients.\r"

Benign epithelial gastric cells obtained from normal gastric mucosa or benign gastric lesions reacted negatively in 12 out of 13 cases. Similarly, benign epithelial colonic cells from normal colon or benign colonic lesions were negative for p21 in nine out of ten cases. Weakly positive reaction, confined to a few cell clusters only, was observed in one smear of a benign gastric ulcer and one smear of chronic ulcerative colitis. All 20 smears from colonic carcinoma and all 20 smears of gastric carcinoma contained cells that stained positively for p21, and the degree of tumor differentiation had no impact on the staining pattern. The results recorded in this study show that the immunocytochemical assay for the ras oncogene product may prove to represent a new tool for the cytodiagnosis of gastric and colonic carcinomas.\r"

The most common histologic subtype was the storiform-pleomorphic type of MFH. Vascular invasion was seen in 50% of cases. Histologic features did not correlate with prognosis, and subsequent aggressive behavior was related primarily to symptomatic presentation, advanced stage at diagnosis, incomplete excision, invasion of the chest wall or mediastinum, and subsequent recurrence or metastasis.

They are discovered among 255 patients treated at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Medical Center, giving an incidence of CNS metastases of 1.96%. All five patients had intraparenchymal brain metastases. It seems likely that the incidence of CNS involvement is increasing in this disease, consonant with improvement of local tumor control and prolonged overall survival. The median duration from the diagnosis of ovarian cancer to the diagnosis of CNS metastases was 25 months (range, 10-126 months). Median survival after diagnosis was 1.3 months (range, 1-10 months). Therapeutic options are discussed, as are possible mechanisms for the occurrence of these metastases.\r"

Methods compared were: (1) aspiration of stomach contents through a large, vented, multi-orificed gastric tube, and (2) indirect determination by a dye dilution method using polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the marker. The volumes determined by these methods (Vasp and Vpeg respectively) were compared to the total volume (Vtot) present in the stomach, determined by direct inspection of the gastric pouch by the surgeon at the beginning of surgery. The results show that the volume of aspirated gastric fluid, using this type of tube, is a very good estimate of the total volume of gastric residue. The PEG dilution method yields similar results. However, correlation between Vpeg and Vtot was not as close-fitting as the correlation between Vasp and Vtot. PEG dilution is more complicated, time-consuming and offers no advantage over aspiration.\r"

Once these features are understood, a better interpretation of the various tests is possible. While a lot of information regarding the proper use of the PNS is derived from meticulous scientific experimentation, it is possible to apply this information for clinical use. Most information is available based on ulnar nerve stimulation. Information on stimulation of other nerves (e.g., current to achieve SMS on the peroneal nerve) is lacking. With this in mind, the authors present in Table III the minimum requirements for a PNS and an algorithm to illustrate use of the PNS, in Figure 6.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the physiologic effects of normal saline versus 5% albuminated saline fluid resuscitation on 10-12-day-old piglets infected with group B streptococci for four hours. After intravenously receiving 1 X 10(10) bacteria/kg over 45 minutes, one group was untreated while the two fluid-treated groups received enough intravenous fluid to maintain the baseline cardiac output. An increase in the resistance to venous blood return was the major limitation to cardiac output. The resistance nearly quadrupled in the untreated piglets as shown by a 50% decrease in cardiac output with a nearly doubling of the driving pressure for venous return (mean circulatory pressure was normal and atrial pressures decreased by 70%). In both fluid-treated groups, resistance doubled as shown by an unchanged cardiac output with a doubling of the driving pressure (mean circulatory pressure increased by 50%) and atrial pressures remained at baseline). Blood volume was 9% below control in the untreated group and 13% above control in both fluid-treated groups. Much more crystalloid (155 ml/kg) than colloid (58 ml/kg) was necessary to maintain baseline cardiac output; this resulted in a 36% decrease in the plasma protein oncotic pressure of the former group and a 15% increase in the oncotic pressure of the latter group. Organ edema formation (ileum, pancreas, kidney, adrenal gland, lung) occurred only in the saline-treated animals. We conclude that increased resistance to venous return was the primary cause of shock in our model and that this can be effectively treated by giving enough intravenous fluid to elevate the mean circulatory pressure. However, if the plasma protein oncotic pressure is also lowered (saline group), organ edema results.\r"

Stimulus-response curves for the renal baroreceptor were determined by measuring the steady-state PRA while the RPP was lowered and then held constant by an inflatable cuff placed around the renal artery. On each diet the control stimulus-response curve can be described by two lines intersecting at a threshold pressure; in the higher pressure range PRA is relatively insensitive to changes in RPP, while in the lower pressure range PRA is very responsive to changes in RPP. On the normal-salt diet CEI significantly increases the sensitivity of PRA to RPP in the responsive range without affecting the threshold pressure itself or the values of PRA at pressures greater than the threshold pressure. On the low-salt diet CEI also increases the sensitivity of PRA to RPP significantly in the responsive range; we were unable to determine the effect of CEI on PRA at RPPs greater than the threshold pressure in the low-salt state because CEI causes a significant drop in blood pressure under these circumstances. The effect of CEI was significantly greater in the dogs on the low-salt diet than in the dogs on the normal-salt diet. Thus, CEI and salt depletion interact synergistically to increase the sensitivity of the renal baroreceptor only in the responsive range of the stimulus-response curve, i.e., at renal perfusion pressures below the threshold pressure.\r"

  ".W": "To clarify the immune mechanism in myocarditis, immunofluorescence techniques with laser flow cytometry were used to examine serial changes in lymphocyte subsets in the heart, spleen, and peripheral blood of DBA/2 and BALB/c mice inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus (Experiment I). B cells were identified by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin. T-cell subsets were identified with rat anti-Thy 1.2, and nonpolymorphic Lyt 1 and Lyt 2 monoclonal antibodies plus fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled anti-mouse immunoglobulin. On days 7 and 14 postinfection, the percentage of Thy 1.2+ (pan T) cells in both strains had decreased in the peripheral blood; B cells showed no significant changes throughout the entire period. On the other hand, Thy 1.2+ (pan T) and Lyt 1+, 23+ (precursor and immature) T cells appeared to occupy the major portion of the myocardium on days 7 and 14 when congestive heart failure developed. To confirm this, serial immunohistologic studies (immunoperoxidase staining) of the hearts of DBA/2 and BALB/c mice with encephalomyocarditis virus-induced myocarditis were performed (Experiment II). In Experiment II, most of the stained cells in the hearts of both strains were Thy 1.2 positive and Lyt 1 and Lyt 2 positive on days 7 and 14. Thus, Experiments I and II demonstrated that lymphocytes at the site of inflammation in acute viral myocarditis carried antigenic markers that differed from those of peripheral lymphocytes and suggested that Thy 1.2+ (pan T) cells, especially the Lyt 1+, 23+ subset (immature T cells and T-cell subset precursors) were involved in the development of myocarditis in these animals.\r"

For this concept to be applied reliably in the clinical setting, factors that may depress glucose availability independent of tissue viability, such as adrenergic stimulation and substrate competition, must be examined. Accordingly, we studied the effect of catecholamine stimulation by dopamine on myocardial glucose uptake in vivo using chronically instrumented, intact dogs and positron emission tomography. We measured myocardial activity of [2-18F]-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and 82Rb in glucose-loaded animals randomly studied during dopamine infusion, during insulin infusion, and then during their combined infusion. Myocardial FDG uptake was significantly decreased when animals were treated with dopamine, compared with treatment in the same animals with insulin. When insulin was added to the dopamine infusion, myocardial FDG uptake was restored. In contrast, myocardial activity of 82Rb, which is taken up in proportion to coronary flow, was similar under all three experimental conditions. Plasma glucose, free fatty acid, and lactate concentrations were determined before and during each infusion. The depression of myocardial FDG activity seen during dopamine infusion and its reversal with addition of insulin can be explained on the basis of effects of these hormones on substrate availability and competition.\r"

To determine whether this approach can be applied to man, we implemented an automatic gain compensation and continuous data acquisition system to characterize myocardium with quantitative ultrasonic backscatter and to detect cardiac cycle-dependent changes in real time. We developed a two-dimensional echocardiographic system with quantitative integrated backscatter imaging capabilities for use in human subjects that can automatically differentiate ultrasonic signals from blood as opposed to those obtained from tissue and adjust the slope of the gain compensation appropriately. Real-time images were formed from a continuous signal proportional to the logarithm of the integrated backscatter along each A-line. In our initial investigation, 15 normal volunteers (ages 17 to 40 years, heart rates 44 to 88 beats/min) and five patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (ages 22 to 52, heart rates 82 to 120 beats/min) were studied with conventional parasternal long-axis echocardiographic views. Diastolic-to-systolic variation of integrated backscatter in the interventricular septum and left ventricular posterior wall was seen in each of the normal subjects averaging 4.6 +/- 1.4 dB (SD) and 5.3 +/- 1.5 dB (n = 127 sites), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-nine patients with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in isolation (n = 17) or in combination with other lesions (n = 12) underwent simultaneous hemodynamic assessment and evaluation of PDA flow velocity by the Doppler method. The accuracy with which Doppler velocity across the PDA predicted pulmonary arterial pressure and the influence of PDA size and shape on the Doppler velocity-pressure relationship were examined. Seventy percent had a cone-shaped PDA (narrowest at the pulmonary artery end), and the remainder were tubular. Narrowest PDA diameter ranged from 1.5 to 9 mm (mean 3.5 mm). Peak systolic and mean pulmonary arterial pressure ranged from 10 to 116 and 8 to 72 mm Hg, respectively. Twenty-one patients (group 1) had left-to-right shunting only. The following variables showed significant correlation in this group: peak instantaneous systolic aortic-to-main pulmonary arterial (MPA) pressure gradient and maximum Doppler velocity across the PDA (slope = 1.03, SEE = 13 mm Hg, r = .94, p less than .001), mean aortic-to-MPA pressure gradient and mean Doppler velocity (slope = 1.06, SEE = 10 mm Hg, r = .95, p less than .001), and end diastolic aortic-to-MPA pressure gradient and minimum Doppler velocity (slope = 1.12, SEE = 8 mm Hg, r = .96, p less than .001). Eight patients (group 2) had bidirectional shunting. In this group peak instantaneous aortic-to-MPA pressure gradient significantly correlated with maximum Doppler velocity measured from the left-to-right shunt (slope = .70, SEE = 2 mm Hg, r = .92, p less than .002) and mean pressure gradient correlated with mean Doppler velocity (slope = .83, SEE = 3 mm Hg, r = .78, p less than .003). Right-to-left Doppler velocities showed no correlation with pressures. In six patients with pulmonary hypertension Doppler velocity changes accurately predicted the effect of pulmonary vasodilation on pulmonary arterial pressure. Doppler velocity of PDA flow reliably predicts pulmonary arterial pressure over a wide range of pressures and PDA shapes and sizes.\r"

  ".W": "Left ventricular systolic torsion and diastolic recoil were quantified in 12 human cardiac transplant recipients with surgically implanted intramyocardial markers with the use of computer-aided analysis of biplane cineradiographic images. Measurements were performed between 6 and 16 weeks after surgery and related to the presence or absence of rejection as determined by cardiac biopsy. Torsional deformation, defined as twisting about the left ventricular long axis of the apical region with respect to the base, was characterized in terms of the rate and amplitude of systolic torsion and the rate of diastolic recoil by means of an internal reference system. Comparison of measurements before, during, and after recovery from 14 rejection episodes allowed assessment of the effects of acute reversible cardiomyopathy on left ventricular torsion and recoil. Compared with prerejection values, the amplitude of torsional deformation in the maximally deforming segment (theta max) decreased by 25% from 21.1 +/- 15.2 to 16.0 +/- 5.7 degrees (p less than .005) during acute rejection with myocyte necrosis; this was associated with significant (p less than .05) decreases in the peak systolic torsion rate (+d theta/dtmax), whereas the peak diastolic recoil rate (-d theta/dtmax) was unchanged. This suggests that the stiffness of elastic components of the myocardium may have increased, maintaining the rate of diastolic recoil when these elements are stretched less. With successful treatment of rejection episodes, the torsional deformation characteristics normalized. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic volume, stroke volume, ejection fraction, and peak left ventricular filling rate were unchanged with rejection episodes, whereas left ventricular end-systolic volume increased (p less than .05) during acute rejection and returned to normal with resolution of the rejection process. These data suggest that left ventricular torsional deformation amplitude and rate are sensitive to episodes of subclinical left ventricular dysfunction and that such intramyocardial marker techniques may provide new insights regarding the elastic properties of the ventricular myocardium and their impact on left ventricular mechanics.\r"

Hypertension was present in 21 of 22 patients, who require multiple drug therapy. Rehabilitation is 100% among discharged patients, with 14 in school, six employed, and two toddlers.\r"

In group I, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. In group II, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week. Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine. Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine. We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.\r"

Most centers exclude patients with pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 6 Wood units. Wood units, however, do not correct for variations in body size and therefore may not be the best measure for use in comparison of patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of 82 cardiac transplant recipients and compared preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) calculated in two ways to the incidence of right ventricular failure and death. Our data show that the PVR index unit (PVRI) identifies those patients that are at risk for right heart failure better than the Wood unit, which does not correct for body size. Four patients died of right heart failure with resistance less than 6 Wood units, but had PVRI greater than 6 units. High resistance is not an absolute contraindication to cardiac transplantation; 28 of 33 patients operated on with a PVRI greater than 6 survived. The degree of elevation of PVR did not correlate with survival. Ten of 12 patients with a PVRI greater than 9 survived. Testing with nitroprusside at cardiac catheterization was helpful in determining reversibility of pulmonary vascular obstruction. No patients with a PVRI less than 6 developed right heart failure.\r"

  ".W": "Accelerated coronary disease in the cardiac allograft (TxCAD) is a major complication affecting long-term survival of heart transplant patients. Since the transplanted heart remains denervated, the first sign of TxCAD may be silent myocardial infarction or sudden death. The prevalence of this disease has been unaltered since the advent of cyclosporine immunosuppression. Serial annual coronary arteriograms in 132 patients undergoing transplantation after 1979 at Stanford revealed 44 patients who developed TxCAD (33%). Multiple variables, including patient lipid profile, extent of donor and recipient tissue match, age of recipient and donor, number of rejection episodes, prednisone dose, and fasting blood sugar were examined in relation to occurrence of TxCAD. Donor age was greater among the 44 patients developing TxCAD that in the 88 patients who did not develop coronary artery disease (23.5 +/- 5.8 vs 21.3 +/- 5.7 years, p less than .05). The fasting plasma triglyceride level 1 year after transplantation was 236.0 +/- 246.3 mg% in the patients with TxCAD vs 170.1 +/- 108.2 mg% in those without TxCAD (p less than .05). No other indexes, including number of rejection episodes during first posttransplant year, number of HL-A mismatches, level of maintenance steroids, fasting blood sugar, and cholesterol subfractions identified patients who developed TxCAD. We conclude that TxCAD has limited correlation with the clinical and laboratory factors analyzed. Higher donor age and elevated plasma triglycerides may be significant predisposing factors for the development of TxCAD.\r"

To assess whether this abnormality is reversible, 32 patients were studied before and 3 to 9 months after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. PNE decreased after the transplant procedure form 739 +/- 363 to 301 +/- 161 pg/ml (p less than .05). In 13 patients, PNE was measured sequentially during the first 3 months after the transplant procedure. PNE decreased from 590 +/- 293 to 321 +/- 208 pg/ml at 2 weeks and remained stable at 1 month (308 +/- 239 pg/ml), 2 months (307 +/- 196 pg/ml), and 3 months (331 +/- 131 pg/ml), even while arterial hypertension developed. No correlation was found between PNE, systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial pressure and cyclosporine A blood levels. These data demonstrate that normalization of plasma levels of norepinephrine occurs shortly after cardiac transplantation in man. This decrease in PNE is probably independent of immunosuppression therapy. Finally, the development of arterial hypertension in cyclosporine A-treated cardiac transplant patients is not due to activation or persistent activation of the sympathetic nervous system.\r"

Ten sheep hearts were removed after application of cold crystalloid potassium cardioplegia. The hearts were immersed in iced normal saline and right ventricular and left ventricular intraventricular balloons were connected to transducers to measure compliance. Thermistor probes were placed in the interventricular septum. The heart was mounted on a retrograde perfusion apparatus via the cannula in the brachiocephalic trunk and placed in an isolated glass cylinder. The perfusion apparatus consisted of a roller pump, a heat exchanger, and a pediatric membrane oxygenator. Control determinations and those after 8 hr of preservation were made while the hearts were perfused with enriched autologous blood. Right and left ventricular compliance, left ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures, right ventricular systolic and diastolic pressures, left ventricular dP/dt, coronary arteriovenous oxygen consumption, lactate production, and heart weight were measured. Results showed significantly improved left and right ventricular systolic function with L-glutamate preservation. Whole heart oxygen consumption in the L-glutamate group showed a 4% increase, while the placebo group showed a significant decrease in oxygen consumption after 8 hr of preservation. The glutamate-preserved hearts also showed no change in lactate production after 8 hr of preservation as compared with a 81% increase in the placebo group. After 8 hr of perfusion there was 67% increase in the heart weight of the control and a 42% increase in the L-glutamate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Serial endomyocardial biopsies, right heart catheterization, and echocardiograms were performed for rejection surveillance. After intensified immunosuppression with equine antithymocyte globulins and steroids, nine patients showed persistent rejection (lymphocytic infiltration and myocyte necrosis). Conventional immunosuppression was contraindicated in one patient. OKT*3 (5 mg by intravenous push daily for 14 days) resulted in complete resolution of rejection in nine of 10 patients (90%). After therapy with OKT*3 mean right atrial and pulmonary arterial wedge pressure were significantly lower (9.1 +/- 4.0 vs 4.8 +/- 2.0 mm Hg and 13.4 +/- 4.3 vs 8.0 +/- 3.3 mm Hg, respectively; p less than .05). Cardiac index was doubled in two patients with rejection-induced cardiac dysfunction (1.5 vs 3.2 and 1.6 vs 2.7 liters/min/m2). Only two patients developed antibodies to OKT*3. Fever, nausea and headache occurred with the first three doses of OKT*3 and did not recur. One patient developed aseptic meningitis. OKT*3 effectively reverses refractory cardiac allograft rejection before the development of irreversible graft dysfunction. Patients who do not develop antibodies to OKT*3 can be retreated with this drug. Adverse reactions to OKT*3 are self-limited.\r"

Endomyocardial biopsy specimens were obtained at the time of each imaging study. Eight patients had positive scans confirmed by biopsy as rejection, and eight patients had negative scans and no evidence of rejection on biopsy. Discordance was observed in four studies, two with positive scans and no rejection on biopsy and two with negative scans and positive biopsy. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the technique were each 80%. Imaging with radiolabeled antimyosin antibody Fab fragments may be of value in the noninvasive identification of rejection in the cardiac transplant recipient.\r"

Peak aortic velocity, left ventricular ejection time index (ETI), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), mitral valve pressure half-time (PHT), peak early mitral flow velocity (M1), and velocity following donor atrial systole (M2) were measured without prior knowledge of endomyocardial biopsy findings. Biopsy specimens were graded histologically as: no rejection, mild rejection (cellular infiltrate), and moderate rejection (myocyte necrosis). A total of 120 biopsy-correlated Doppler echocardiographic studies were performed during 16 weeks after cardiac transplantation. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were significantly higher in transplant recipients than in normal subjects. IVRT and PHT were significantly longer, while M1 and M2 were similar. Peak aortic velocity was higher in normal subjects than in transplant recipients, while ejection time was similar. Rejection of increasing severity was associated with a progressive shortening of IVRT and PHT and with an increase in M1 (p less than .0005 for all comparisons). Peak aortic velocity and ejection time index did not change significantly with rejection. These data indicate that acute cardiac rejection is accompanied by alteration in left ventricular filling dynamics detectable by Doppler echocardiography, without measureable changes in systolic function. These changes may provide noninvasive markers for surveillance of rejection.\r"

A further 5 successful renal transplant patients were investigated to analyse the evolution of the brain stem conduction when the metabolic abnormality is removed. In the first group, the responses were minimally abnormal in 30% of cases before the dialysis. The dialysis session showed an improvement of the brain stem conduction. This variation was temporary and, 24 hours following the dialysis treatment, the patients showed the pathological values observed before the dialysis. The results of the successful transplanted patients were consistent with the data obtained in the dialysis group. Before transplantation the nerve impulse conduction was found to be abnormal in 3 subjects. These abnormalities disappeared completely after successful transplantation. These results support the view of those who favour the use of evoked potentials to follow the status of the central nervous system in uraemic patients.\r"

Mean arterial pressure was lower on CAPD and serum glucose was higher. No significant difference was seen in weight, hematocrit, BUN, or potassium, however. Plasma volume was not decreased in five CAPD patients: 3619 +/- 358 ml (predicted 3083 +/- 201 ml). Elevated catecholamine levels were seen in CAPD patients: norepinephrine 868.0 +/- 104.1 (normal 358.4 +/- 41.5 pg/ml), epinephrine 386.3 +/- 49.2 (normal 58.3 +/- 10.6 pg/ml). Plasma vasopressin levels were elevated to the range usually seen with hyperosmolality. In eight patients who lost or gained weight on CAPD, levels of PRA and PA changed as expected, but catecholamine levels did not correlate with weight changes. The data suggest that in CAPD patients, PRA and PA may be elevated in association with augmented sympathetic stimulation and elevated vasopressin levels. Serial observations demonstrated that PRA and PA can respond appropriately to changes in body weight, while catecholamine and vasopressin levels seem to be influenced by other factors.\r"

The second case, due to cytomegalovirus reactivation/reinfection had fewer symptoms and occurred 78 days following transplantation. 99mTc DTPA perfusion index at the height of the cytomegalovirus associated illness remained unaltered in both cases, and did not suggest the presence of acute rejection. This non-reactive response was associated with a rapid return of graft function. The combined use of these rapid diagnostic tests during suspected rejection episodes may be useful in indicating cytomegalovirus associated allograft dysfunction and preventing the addition of further potentially harmful immunosuppressants.\r"

With the exception of one deep infection, the grafts have not undergone resorption in this period of follow-up study.

  ".W": "Although musculoaponeurotic fibromatosis (MAF) is a well-recognized entity, it still provides a histologic diagnostic enigma, particularly in its distinction from a well-differentiated fibrosarcoma. The lesion is histologically identical to a desmoid tumor. The lesion appears as a firm swelling in a limb or limb girdle, with a rare incidence of pain. Although it is more common in the second to fourth decades (premenopausal women predominantly), it does occur in children. The sex incidence in children is equal. A multicentric pattern of behavior may be evident. The mainstay of treatment has been surgical excision of varying extent. Local excision, even if radical, may be followed by up to a 65% recurrence rate. In this review, 40% of the cases had more than one recurrence. Recent evidence suggests radiotherapy, which has been reserved for inoperable lesions, may be of value as an adjunct to primary treatment. Limited local excision with adjunctive radiotherapy may decrease recurrence rate, minimize functional deficit, and improve cosmesis. Radical local resection (compartmental or amputation) may be avoidable. In children, amputation may not result in cure because of the multicentric behavior pattern and radiotherapy may lead to growth retardation. A shorter functional upper or lower limb is preferable to an amputation stump or a limb disfigured from radical excision.\r"

The proximal anterior and lateral aspects of the implant were encrusted with bone. The bone was attached to the porous coating in regions of ingrowth. The implant was stable within the femur although most of the porous coating was not bone ingrown. There was progressive bone resorption in the proximal femur, suggestive of a reactive biologic mechanism. There was also a sizable posterior pocket of granulation tissue containing chronic inflammatory round cells associated with numerous birefringent polymeric particles. Polyethylene wear debris and acrylic cement were engulfed by multinucleated giant cells enveloping the loose cup.\r"

  ".U": "88028125\r", 
  ".W": "It is now well established that the meniscus performs a number of roles that are important to the efficient performance of the knee joint. Of particular importance is the recognition of its load-bearing function and its stabilization of the joint during flexion-extension. The compression of the wedge-shaped meniscus during loading is translated into circumferential stresses, and the collagen fiber distribution and orientation is well adapted for this mechanical role. Proteoglycans of the meniscus have structural characteristics in common with those of articular cartilage but do not appear to influence the tensile properties of menisci. With aging and degeneration, compositional changes take place within the meniscus that reduce its ability to transmit tensional stresses, and this contributes to failure. Total meniscectomy is not a benign procedure. Partial excision has less deleterious effects on the joint. Surgical repair of meniscus lesions has now emerged as a procedure of some significance and laboratory research suggests that a solution to this problem may be within reach. Experimental studies in dogs also indicate that chondroprotective agents such as semisynthetic sulfated polysaccharides may protect articular cartilage after meniscectomy.\r"

After meniscal injury, retention of the meniscus in part (partial meniscectomy) or in whole (meniscal suture) is preferable. Replacement of a previously removed meniscus (meniscal transplantation) may be feasible in the future. Fifty patients had arthroscopic partial meniscectomies performed alternately by standard mechanical techniques or by electrosurgical techniques. The latter group was found to have less pain and swelling. Another 46 patients had meniscal sutures performed on one or more menisci. Twenty-one of these patients had a follow-up arthroscopy for recurrence of symptoms and only one meniscus had not healed. Another single patient had a meniscal transplant, and a follow-up arthroscopy six months after surgery revealed the meniscus to be largely intact.\r"

  ".W": "Surfactant therapy for RDS is likely to become widespread in the near future. Animal data indicate that this will not preclude a role for hormonal acceleration of lung maturation. In studies with prematurely delivered and ventilated fetal rabbits, Fiascone et al. have shown that the administration of betamethasone antenatally improves lung compliance, as does intratracheal administration of excess amounts of adult rabbit natural surfactant. If the two therapies are combined, however, an additive effect is observed. This suggests that some of the effects of glucocorticoids on lung compliance are not related to surfactant. Prior glucocorticoid therapy may provide a benefit that differs from that of surfactant therapy because steroids mature the lungs anatomically and enhance nonsurfactant-related tissue compliance. It is also possible that surfactant therapy itself may be more effective in the presence of larger and increased numbers of alveoli. It thus seems likely that in the future both hormonal enhancement of lung maturation and surfactant therapy may be used in combination to further reduce the morbidity and mortality from RDS.\r"

  ".U": "88028250\r", 
  ".W": "Although the respiratory system is not fully developed at birth, the human newborn infant has flexible strategies to sustain breathing and defend blood gas homeostasis in both health and disease conditions. Initially the thresholds for chemoreceptor response to PO2 and PCO2 closely mimic those of the fetus, but the threshold resets to sustain ventilation adequate for blood gas homeostasis appropriate to the extrauterine milieu. The muscles of respiration have been \"trained\" in utero and effectively assume the function of the respiratory pump, despite their marginal reserve against fatigue. The pliable chest wall is functionally stabilized by the tonic activity of the intercostal muscles, thereby allowing effective ventilation. Finally, expiration is prolonged by the postinspiratory activity of the diaphragm and laryngeal braking as a means of maintaining an elevated lung volume and augmenting FRC. The ventilatory response of the newborn to respiratory disease is limited. The magnitude of the VE response is smaller than that of the adult, and is characterized by an increase in the respiratory rate and a limited increase in the VT. The poor effort reserve of the muscles, especially the diaphragm, predisposes the newborn to muscle fatigue and ventilatory failure. To avoid fatigue, recruitment of accessory muscles occurs, along with laryngeal braking of expiration, thereby decreasing the work of the diaphragm, recruiting new alveoli by an auto-PEEP effect, increasing the FRC volume, and improving gas exchange by an increase in the pulmonary surface area. These mechanisms help to avoid muscle exhaustion and facilitate adequate gas exchange in the presence of lung disease. We do not know precisely the postconceptual age at which the newborn is sufficiently developed to adopt these various defensive strategies of breathing, but the presence of tachypnea and grunting in 28-week-old premature infants suggests that long before term the human infant is capable of remarkable variation in the defense of breathing.\r"

Methodologies to study in vivo free radical-mediated processes are improving with the use of electron spin trapping of tissue samples, and in the future the precise role of oxygen radicals in oxygen injury may become clearer. With this new work with the chemistry and biochemistry of oxygen radicals, it is crucial to remember the special attributes of oxygen radical behavior in eukaryotic cells. There are many disparate compartments in cells that differ with respect to hydrophobicity, pH, and presence of iron salts and antioxidants. The ability of any oxygen radical; O2-, H2O2, .OH, to cause damage, will depend greatly on these and other factors. The final piece of the oxygen toxicity puzzle is the presence and activity of antioxidant substances, both enzymatic and nonenzymatic. Here again, compartmentalization is important. To provide beneficial protection, the antioxidant must be present in sufficiently high concentrations at the site of radical production or damage. In the special case of the premature infant who requires oxygen therapy, the balance between oxygen radical production and antioxidant capacities will determine whether oxygen injury ultimately occurs. The biologic uniqueness of the premature infant in regards to maturation and growth mandates investigations of these biochemical phenomena in appropriate experimental models, rather than extrapolation from studies conducted in adults and perhaps even full-term newborns.\r"

One hundred ninety-five patients with severe pain resulting from episiotomy, cesarean section, or gynecologic surgery completed a randomized, double-blind, stratified, parallel-group study. Patients were observed during a 4-hour period after medication. Based on the sum of the pain intensity differences (SPID), total pain relief (TOTPAR), and most of the hourly direct measures of pain and relief, both doses of the combination and ibuprofen 400 mg alone were statistically superior to placebo. Codeine 60 mg was statistically superior to placebo based on TOTPAR, the global ratings, and a few hourly measures. The mean effect of the combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly superior to the mean effect of ibuprofen 400 mg alone 1/2, 1, and 2 hours after medication and to the mean effect of ibuprofen 400 mg alone and codeine 60 mg alone for SPID, TOTPAR, and other measures as well. The low-dose combination was significantly more effective than codeine 60 mg for a few hourly measures but was not significantly superior to ibuprofen 400 mg. Based on these findings it appears that the combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 60 mg, particularly in the first few hours after medication, is more efficacious than its constituents.\r"

  ".W": "Bopindolol is a new long-acting, nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with partial agonist activity. Its acute (24 hours, 2 mg, administered orally) and long-term (3 weeks, 2 to 4 mg) hemodynamic and hormonal effects were studied in a single-blind placebo-controlled trial in 10 hypertensive subjects. The initial response (mean +/- SE) to bopindolol was a fall in cardiac output (-12% +/- 2%) and heart rate (-11% +/- 2%). Mean arterial pressure began to fall 3 to 4 hours after administration in parallel with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, which had increased initially. Twenty-four hours after administration, mean arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance were reduced by 12% +/- 2% and 12% +/- 5%, respectively. By that time heart rate and cardiac output did not differ from baseline values despite beta-blockade. After 3 weeks of treatment mean arterial pressure had fallen by 9% +/- 2% and renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were not changed. One week after withdrawal from treatment mean arterial pressure and heart rate were no longer reduced, but beta-blockade could still be demonstrated, establishing the long duration of action of the drug.\r"

In a double-blind, randomized, crossover study of the effects of 4 weeks of therapy, each with two dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker drugs, nifedipine and nicardipine, glucose tolerance, plasma insulin levels, and hemoglobin A1 were assessed in 20 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (mean age 59 years). There was no significant difference in glucose tolerance on active therapy (AUC: control, 548.3 +/- 24.8; nifedipine, 559.3 +/- 41.0; and nicardipine, 589.3 +/- 40.3). Similarly, despite producing significant hemodynamic effects, these drugs produced no significant effect on plasma insulin and hemoglobin A1 levels. Calcium channel blocker drugs may be useful alternatives to thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers in the treatment of ischemic heart disease and hypertension, especially in patients with diabetes.\r"

  ".W": "Retardation of meal carbohydrate absorption by inhibition of starch degradation improves glucose tolerance in normal and diabetic humans. To determine the effects of Bay-m-1099, a new alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, on insulin requirements and prandial glucose tolerance in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), plasma glucose, triglyceride, and free insulin concentrations were measured after ingestion of a standard breakfast, lunch, and dinner in nine patients with IDDM in a single-blind, randomized, crossover design. A 20% reduction in insulin was given 30 minutes before the meals when the subjects received Bay-m-1099 (50 mg). This resulted in the AUC for plasma insulin to be significantly less with Bay-m-1099 (AUC, 8.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 12.8 +/- 1.6 microU/ml/min with placebo; P less than 0.01). Despite this reduction in plasma insulin levels, postprandial plasma glucose concentrations were reduced for the breakfast (73 +/- 15 vs. 112 +/- 14 mg/dl/min with placebo; P less than 0.01) and dinner (23 +/- 8 vs. 4 +/- 1 mg/dl/min with placebo; P less than 0.05) meal with Bay-m-1099. Bay-m-1099 did not affect postprandial plasma triglycerides and was well tolerated, the major side effect being flatulence (4/9) and mild diarrhea (4/9). We conclude that inhibition of intestinal alpha-glucosidases by Bay-m-1099 in IDDM reduces meal insulin requirements by at least 20% and that such an agent could be useful in the management of diabetes mellitus by reducing hyperinsulinemia.\r"

Anesthesia was maintained for the first group with a halothane-nitrous oxide technique; the second group received fentanyl-barbiturate-tranquilizer-nitrous oxide. As the infusion ended, plasma vecuronium concentrations were 0.34 (+/- 0.10) microgram/ml for the halothane group and 0.32 (+/- 0.07) microgram/ml for the fentanyl group, associated with 93% (+/- 8) and 88% (+/- 10) twitch depression, respectively. Vecuronium plasma concentration-time data were combined with the simultaneous intensities of neuromuscular blockade to model the kinetic-dynamic values for each patient. For the halothane group the steady-state volume was 0.21 (+/- 0.04) L/kg, the clearance was 2.9 (+/- 0.1) ml/min/kg, and the elimination half-life was 100 (+/- 36) minutes; for the fentanyl group these were 0.20 (+/- 0.08) L/kg, 3.2 (+/- 0.1) ml/min/kg, and 84 (+/- 43) minutes, respectively. Plasma concentrations associated with 50% blockade averaged 0.2 microgram/ml for both groups. Neither the pharmacokinetics nor the pharmacodynamics of vecuronium in humans differed between these two patient groups.\r"

Intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate was given alone in doses of 15 or 30 mg. The methylprednisolone dose was reduced by 57% when ketoconazole was administered chronically for 1 week to seek equivalent methylprednisolone AUCs by compensating for the expected reduction in methylprednisolone clearance. Ketoconazole decreased clearance by 46% and increased mean residence time by 37%. The ratio of the cortisol AUC during each drug treatment compared with baseline conditions was used to assess the net extent and duration of cortisol suppression. This cortisol AUC ratio was reduced from 0.45 (methylprednisolone) to 0.39 (methylprednisolone plus ketoconazole), suggesting that ketoconazole modestly enhanced (P less than 0.01) cortisol suppression. Based on the reduction in methylprednisolone clearance and cortisol AUC by ketoconazole, a 50% lower dose of methylprednisolone during concomitant therapy with ketoconazole is recommended.\r"

An intravenous dose of cimetidine, 7 mg/kg, was administered on day 7 of the normal (100 gm/70 kg protein/day) and the restricted (19 gm/70 kg protein/day) diets. The renal clearance of cimetidine was unchanged by the dietary restriction; however, the fractional excretion of cimetidine increased from 3.06 to 3.94 (P less than 0.05), indicating an apparent increase in net tubular secretion of cimetidine during the restricted diet. We conclude that cimetidine dosage adjustments are apparently not necessary for patients with acutely restricted nutrient intake, although other weakly acidic and basic drugs may require dosage changes.\r"

Nineteen patients with a spectrum of immunologically related disorders were studied before and immediately after plasmapheresis for changes in plasma aldosterone, insulin and arginine vasopressin (AVP). Renin was also measured in 11 of these patients by direct radioimmunoassay. 125% of the initial plasma volume was replaced, which corresponded to a predicted removal of 72% for any plasma constituent. 2. The initial, final (experimental) and final (predicted) concentrations (means +/- SEM) were 337 +/- 50, 185 +/- 23 and 100 +/- 16 pg/ml respectively for renin, 465 +/- 86, 146 +/- 38 and 124 +/- 22 pmol/l respectively for aldosterone, 218 +/- 35, 69 +/- 11 and 63 +/- 11 pmol/l respectively for insulin, 7.2 +/- 1.9, 6.1 +/- 0.5 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/l respectively for AVP. The predicted final concentration was calculated from the initial concentration and the fraction of plasma volume exchanged. The experimental final concentration was lower than the initial concentration for renin, aldosterone and insulin (P less than 0.001) but not for AVP. The predicted final concentration was lower than the experimental final concentration for AVP and renin (P less than 0.001) but not for aldosterone and insulin. Plasma volume, osmolality, glucose, sodium and potassium concentrations did not change significantly. 3. The concentrations of renin, aldosterone, insulin and AVP in the removed plasma were 84 +/- 17 pg/ml, 179 +/- 36, 98 +/- 15 and 4.8 +/- 0.7 pmol/l respectively. The amount subtracted expressed as percentage of the total amount present in plasma was markedly greater for AVP than for the three other plasma constituents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"
