  ".W": "The relationship between sensitization to common allergens and the development of asthma and seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) was investigated in a total of 419 schoolchildren in a farming community where allergens of both Dermatophagoides farinae (Df) and orchard grass (OG) pollen predominate. Twelve subjects (2.9%) were found to have asthma and 35 subjects (8.4%) SAR. There was no significant association between occurrences of asthma and SAR. The incidence of asthma correlated with DF-specific IgE levels but not with OG-specific IgE levels, whereas that of SAR correlated with OG-specific IgE levels but not with Df-specific IgE levels. No significant correlation was detected between IgE antibody levels against Df and OG. These results suggest that asthma occurs independently of SAR.\r"

We specifically sought to determine if MRSA colonization was predictive of subsequent infection. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Long-term Veterans Affairs Medical Center. PATIENTS: A total of 197 patients residing on two units were followed with regular surveillance cultures of the anterior nares. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: The development of staphylococcal infection. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were persistent carriers of MRSA and 44 were persistent carriers of methicillin-susceptible strains (MSSA). Twenty-five percent of MRSA carriers had an episode of staphylococcal infection compared with 4% of MSSA carriers and 4.5% of non-carriers (P less than 0.01; relative risk 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0 to 6.4). The rate of development of infection among MRSA carriers was 15% for every 100 days of carriage. Using logistic regression analysis, persistent MRSA carriage was the most significant predictor of infection (P less than 0.001; odds ratio, 3.7). Seventy-three percent of all MRSA infections occurred among MRSA carriers. Isolates of MRSA from 7 patients were typed. Colonizing and infecting strains had the same phage type in all 7 patients and the same pattern of plasmid EcoRI restriction endonuclease fragments in 5 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Colonization of the anterior nares by MRSA predicts the development of staphylococcal infection in long-term care patients; most infections arise from endogenously carried strains. Colonization by MRSA indicates a significantly greater risk for infection than does colonization by MSSA. The results offer a theoretic rationale for reduction in MRSA infections by interventions aimed at eliminating the carrier state.\r"

SETTING: Patients who received transplants at a single referral-based center. PATIENTS: Adults of 18 years of age or older who had received bone marrow transplants at least 6 months previously and who were not in a life-threatening relapse were surveyed a mean of 47 months after transplant (median, 37 months; range, 6 to 149 months). Of 171 eligible patients, 157 were contacted and 135 (86%) responded. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients completed a mailed survey. Medical records were also reviewed. Most patients (93%) reported they could do normal activities with minor or no physical problems (Karnofsky scores, greater than or equal to 80%). Global health was described as good to excellent by 67% of subjects. Most perceived social activities (80%) or physical functional abilities (67%) to be unimpaired or only slightly affected. Moderate or severe pain was uncommon (13%). Sixty-five percent had returned to full- or part-time employment, and one third of those who were not employed were attending school. Job discrimination and problems in obtaining insurance were reported by 23% and 39%, respectively. Among those who had been employed before illness, loss of employment was associated with lower social functioning, chronic graft-versus-host disease, greater job discrimination, and female gender using multivariate logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS: Most subjects surviving bone marrow transplant reported good to excellent health and functional ability. Three fourths were employed or enrolled in school. These outcomes are comparable to outcomes in survivors of cancer who received less intensive treatments.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombinant envelope glycoprotein (rgp 160) candidate vaccine in humans. SUBJECTS: Healthy adults (72) who were seronegative for HIV-1 were randomly assigned to one of four groups. INTERVENTIONS: The subjects were randomly assigned to receive 40 or 80 micrograms of rgp 160, 10 micrograms of hepatitis B vaccine, or placebo in three doses (on days 0, 30, and 180), with an elective, nonblinded administration of a fourth dose on day 540. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Neither clinical nor laboratory toxicity was encountered during a follow-up period exceeding 21 months. No effect of immunization was noted on lymphocyte counts, mitogenic responses, or delayed-type hypersensitivity. Serum antibody responses to HIV envelope proteins detected by Western blot were seen in 30 of 33 subjects (91%; 95% CI, 71% to 97%) receiving either 40- or 80-micrograms doses of rgp160 and were most commonly of weakly reactive intensity. Responses were first noted by Western blot after the second dose. They markedly increased in frequency after the third dose and declined over the next 12 to 18 months. The administration of a fourth dose resulted in homologous neutralizing activity in sera from 5 to 24 subjects (21%; CI, 7% to 37%) as well as in complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement in sera from 6 of 24 subjects (25%; CI, 10% to 42%). Antibody responses were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) less frequently than by Western blot, and these responses persisted for a shorter time. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of rgp160 was well tolerated and safe, resulted in a high rate of antibody response by Western blot after the administration of the third and fourth doses, and generated serum neutralizing activity and complement-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement in some subjects after the fourth dose.\r"

DESIGN: Consecutive entry trial, including cardiac patients who initiated amiodarone medication but excluding those with abnormal thyroid function (defined as peak thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone [TRH] less than 2.8 or greater than 22.0 mU/L) either before or during amiodarone treatment. PATIENTS: Twenty-three patients who remained euthyroid were studied. INTERVENTION: Oral administration of amiodarone (mean duration of treatment, 17 months; range, 6 to 30 months). MEASUREMENTS: Fasting plasma lipids, thyroid hormones, and peak TSH to TRH values were recorded before and every 6 months during amiodarone treatment. RESULTS: Plasma cholesterol gradually increased from 5.1 +/- 0.2 mmol/L before treatment to 6.9 +/- 0.8 mmol/L after 30 months of amiodarone medication (P less than 0.001); the peak TSH response to TRH did not change. When age- and sex-specific reference values were applied, 30% of the patients had cholesterol values above the 75th percentile before treatment; this number rose to 69% after 2 years of treatment. The rise in plasma cholesterol was associated with an equal increase in apoprotein B. Plasma cholesterol was not related to the daily dose of amiodarone or to plasma concentrations of amiodarone, desethylamiodarone, thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), or reverse triiodothyronine (rT3). Linear regression analysis indicated a positive relation between plasma cholesterol and the cumulative dose of amiodarone (r = 0.25, P less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: Long-term amiodarone treatment is associated with a dose-dependent increase in plasma cholesterol that is independent of thyroid function.\r"

INTERVENTIONS: Patients with frequent life-threatening symptoms were treated with a prophylactic regimen. Patients with infrequent episodes of idiopathic anaphylaxis were only treated acutely for each episode of anaphylaxis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The results favored prophylactic treatment with prednisone for patients who were classified as generalized-frequent in the clinical outcome measures of frequency (per patient per year) of episodes (mean before treatment, 7.31 +/- 6.46; after treatment, 3.61 +/- 4.73; P less than 0.02) and emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 1.94 +/- 3.42; after treatment, 0.21 +/- 0.44; P less than 0.005) and for patients classified as angioedema-frequent in the frequency of episodes (mean before treatment, 14.93 +/- 15.89; after treatment, 2.58 +/- 2.18; P less than 0.003) and emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 0.76 +/- 1.01; after treatment, 0.07 +/- 0.11; P less than 0.025). No statistically significant difference was found for patients classified as generalized-infrequent in the frequency of episodes (mean before treatment, 2.01 +/- 1.30; after treatment, 1.36 +/- 1.79) or of the emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 0.56 +/- 0.71; after treatment, 0.32 +/- 0.75) or for patients classified as angioedema-infrequent in the frequency of episodes (mean before treatment, 1.94 +/- 1.55; after treatment, 2.03 +/- 2.16) or of emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 0.27 +/- 0.44; after treatment, 0.37 +/- 0.59).

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the relations among patient history, symptoms, objective indicators, and abnormal double-contrast barium enema results in outpatients. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Seven hundred and ninety-four patients receiving care in a large multispecialty medical group. DESIGN: Physicians completed a form before ordering a double-contrast barium enema, listing information about patient history, symptoms, and objective findings, including the results of a complete blood count, stool hemoccult, and sigmoidoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures were colon cancer and any abnormal finding. The results of 18.6% of the barium enemas were abnormal. The most frequent positive findings were of polyps (8.8%) and colon cancer (2.9%). Over 50% of the barium enemas were ordered solely on the basis of symptoms, yet there was no statistical correlation between symptoms and colon cancer or any positive finding. Using logistic regression, four variables were shown to be significant predictors of colon cancer (P less than 0.05): abnormal sigmoidoscopy, iron deficiency anemia, positive stool hemoccult results, and relevant history. The respective odds ratios of these variables were 3.76 (95% CI, 2.89 to 4.90); 2.86 (CI, 2.13 to 3.74); 1.87 (CI, 1.46 to 2.39); and 1.91 (CI, 1.44 to 2.52), respectively. In a patient without any of these indicators, the predicted probability of having colon cancer was only 0.7%. In a patient with at least two objective indicators, the probability of having colon cancer was greater than 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms without objective indicators or pertinent risk factors do not correlate with an abnormal double-contrast barium enema result. Objective indicators are useful predictors of an abnormal barium enema result, particularly when looking for colon cancer.\r"

DATA SOURCES: Studies published since 1982 identified through computerized searches of MEDLINE, TOXLINE, and Chemical Abstracts and a review of bibliographies of relevant articles on the subject of caffeine and cardiac arrhythmias. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies examining caffeine as a cause of cardiac arrhythmias and a selection of basic science experiments to illustrate caffeine's effects in vitro. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all available clinical data pertaining to caffeine as a cause of arrhythmias were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: In one electrophysiologic study, caffeine was associated with an increased susceptibility to provoked cardiac arrhythmias. In five placebo-controlled trials, caffeine in doses up to 500 mg daily (equivalent to 5 to 6 cups of coffee) did not increase the frequency or severity of ventricular arrhythmias. One large epidemiologic study reported an increase in the frequency of ventricular extrasystoles in persons consuming 9 or more cups of coffee daily. CONCLUSION: Moderate ingestion of caffeine does not increase the frequency or severity of cardiac arrhythmias in normal persons, patients with ischemic heart disease, or those with pre-existing serious ventricular ectopy.\r"

  ".W": "Patients, families, and physicians frequently decide that a hospitalized patient will forgo cardiopulmonary resuscitation and document this decision with a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. In community settings (home, nursing home, hospice), these orders may conflict with paramedics' standing orders to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation whenever it is medically indicated. We did a nationwide telephone survey of state offices for coordination of emergency medical services (EMS) to see how the states deal with this potential conflict. We identified eight states that have specific policies enabling EMS personnel to accept DNR orders for patients being transported by ambulance. State officials identified administrative complexities and legal concerns as the primary barriers to enacting prehospitalization DNR policies. We also identified 21 local EMS systems that have developed policies for accepting orders to withhold life-sustaining treatment. Four types of policy models, characterized according to procedure for validating DNR orders and telephone accessing the EMS system, show that regulatory reform can address policy barriers in the absence of enabling legislation.\r"

The consultant's special clinical skills include the ability to identify and analyze ethical problems; use reasonable clinical judgment; communicate effectively; negotiate and facilitate negotiations; and teach others how to construct their own ethical frameworks for medical decision making. Appropriate roles for the consultant include those of professional colleague, negotiator, patient and physician advocate, case manager, and educator. The training necessary for an ethics consultant includes substantial patient care experience, instruction in health care law and moral reasoning, and preparation in medical humanism. We favor a clinical model for ethics consultation. When urgent care is needed, other consultants promptly see the patient; the clinical ethics consultant can be expected to do the same.\r"

There were no recurrences in the 49 patients during an average follow-up period of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10 years).

That single strain was only partially resistant, ie, it was resistant to 0.0001% dapsone in a mouse diet but not to higher concentrations. During the years 1983 through 1988, M leprae from 47 previously untreated patients presenting to clinics in San Francisco, Calif, and Los Angeles, Calif, grew in mice. None of these strains was found to be dapsone resistant. Thus, from 1978 through 1988 only one of 101 M leprae isolates obtained from skin biopsy specimens from patients with leprosy was found to be resistant to dapsone. We have concluded that primary dapsone resistance still does not appear to be a significant problem in California. Owing to the fact that our single resistant case and those reported from international sources are, in general, partially resistant, the potential importance of partial dapsone resistance is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The expression of type VII collagen and 19-DEJ-1 antigen was examined in 73 and 71 patients, respectively, with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), comprising gravis, mitis, inversa, and indeterminant subsets, to better determine the specificity and sensitivity of two monoclonal antibodies directed against these dermoepidermal junction-specific epitopes. Type VII collagen (LH 7:2 epitope) was usually absent (in 90%) in patients with the gravis variant of RDEB, whereas its expression was most often diminished (in 67%) in those with the mitis form of the disease. Only 2% and 5% of patients with gravis and mitis variants, respectively, had apparent normal amounts of type VII collagen within their skin. In contrast, six (86%) of seven patients with the inversa variant had normal expression of the antigen. Only 25% of all patients with RDEB lacked the 19-DEJ-1 antigen; of these, however, most had the gravis variant, although absence or diminution was also infrequently observed in those with the mitis and inversa forms. Intermediate findings were noted in patients classified as having indeterminant forms of RDEB. Some variability in antigen expression was also noted among affected siblings. We conclude that assessment of expression of the LH 7:2 epitope of type VII collagen may be diagnostically useful, although considerable overlap does exist between individual patients with gravis and mitis forms. 19-DEJ-1 expression is a far less sensitive probe in RDEB, although such data may prove useful in the assessment of newborns lacking the characteristic features of gravis disease. In addition, based on our experience with inversa RDEB, it would appear that altered expression of type VII collagen cannot be attributed to blister formation in this latter rare subset, since this antigen is usually strongly detected along the dermoepidermal junction, even in perilesional skin sites.\r"

Clinically, however, they are quite often interpreted as condylomata acuminata and recent studies have suggested that they could be related to human papillomavirus infection. This prompted us to search for human papillomavirus DNA using the Southern blot hybridization technique, by analyzing biopsy specimens taken from 29 patients who presented with papillae of the vestibular mucosa. Human papillomavirus sequences were detected only in two (6.9%) cases. By the same technique, human papillomavirus sequences were detected in 24 (96%) of 25 vulvar warts used as the control specimens. Thus, it appears unlikely that vestibular papillae are related to human papillomavirus infection. They are usually distinguishable from condylomata acuminata by clinical examination alone.\r"

In eleven cases, the test results were positive for papillomavirus antigens, and in five of them, papillomaviruslike particles were observed by electron microscopy. Histological examination showed most of the cysts to contain intracytoplasmic eosinophilic bodies in cells of the cyst wall as well as the vacuolar structures in the keratinous mass within the cavity. These findings suggest an etiologic association between the papillomavirus and plantar epidermoid cysts. The \"cystic papilloma\" produced in rabbits by the Shope papillomavirus has been clearly demonstrated. We propose that human papillomaviruses play an important role in the genesis of plantar epidermoid cysts. This is the first report on the possible existence of a cystic papilloma in humans.\r"

However, very little is known about the dysfunctional interactions among T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and antigen-presenting cells. A 30-year-old heterosexual man with a 10-year history of persistent multiple refractory flat wart lesions containing human papillomavirus type 3-related DNA sequence was studied. The patient had a severe depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes and a compensatory increase in the number of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Impaired T-lymphocyte response to various stimuli was found. Depletion of the increased number of CD8+ T lymphocytes, which suppressed immunoglobulin production in vitro, did not restore the impaired T-lymphocyte response. Immobilized anti-CD3 beads that stimulate the T lymphocyte antigen complex in the absence of antigen-presenting cells indicated a T-lymphocyte defect, rather than a decreased antigen-presenting cell function. Thus, the pronounced cellular immunodeficiency was due to abnormal function of the CD4+ helper/inducer T lymphocytes.\r"

Clear perivascular deposits of IgD and C3 were presented in early lesional skin on immunofluorescence investigation. Circulating IgD immune complexes were demonstrated on several occasions, both during and in between clinical attacks. These findings are consistent with an IgD immune complex-mediated pathogenesis for the skin lesions. In 10 patients with other forms of immune complex vasculitis of the skin, minimal perivascular deposits of IgD were found in four cases. In these cases, however, IgD was never found as the solitary immunoglobulin class.\r"

  ".W": "Melanoma is the second most common cancer, after testicular cancer, in males in the U.S. Navy. A wide range of occupations with varying exposures to sunlight and other possible etiologic agents are present in the Navy. Person-years at risk and cases of malignant melanoma were ascertained using computerized service history and inpatient hospitalization files maintained at the Naval Health Research Center. A total of 176 confirmed cases of melanoma were identified in active-duty white male enlisted Navy personnel during 1974-1984. Risk of melanoma was determined for individual occupations and for occupations grouped by review of job descriptions into three categories of sunlight exposure: (1) indoor, (2) outdoor, or (3) indoor and outdoor. Compared with the U.S. civilian population, personnel in indoor occupations had a higher age-adjusted incidence rate of melanoma, i.e., 10.6 per 100,000 (p = .06). Persons who worked in occupations that required spending time both indoors and outdoors had the lowest rate, i.e., 7.0 per 100,000 (p = .06). Incidence rates of melanoma were higher on the trunk than on the more commonly sunlight-exposed head and arms. Two single occupations were found to have elevated rates of melanoma: (1) aircrew survival equipmentman, SIR = 6.8 (p less than .05); and (2) engineman, SIR = 2.8 (p less than .05). However, there were no cases of melanoma or no excess risk in occupations with similar job descriptions. Findings on the anatomical site of melanoma from this study suggest a protective role for brief, regular exposure to sunlight and fit with recent laboratory studies that have shown vitamin D to suppress growth of malignant melanoma cells in tissue culture. A mechanism is proposed in which vitamin D inhibits previously initiated melanomas from becoming clinically apparent.\r"

Most of the pyrimidine levels correlated well with blood lead concentrations (Pb-B) and pyrimidine 5'-nucleotidase (P5N) activity. Highly significant correlations were found between Pb-B and uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose (UDPG), cytidine 5'-triphosphate (CTP), or CDP-choline (CDPC). The levels of these compounds were sharply elevated when P5N activity was reduced to levels less than 7 mumole/h.g hemoglobin (Hb), which corresponded to a Pb-B of 60 micrograms/100 g. Therefore, concentration of these nucleotides may provide a useful index of lead poisoning. Adenosine 5'-triphospate (ATP) concentrations were correlated negatively with Pb-B, whereas adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) concentrations were correlated positively with Pb-B. These results suggest that lead affects not only pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism but also purine nucleotide metabolism (energy production system).\r"

On the basis of occupational anamnesis, 28 had occasional past professional exposure to asbestos; the remaining 37 workers denied any contact with asbestos. A total of 54 white-collar workers who had no occupational exposure to asbestos were included in the study as controls. An increased prevalence and concentration of ABs was found in the BALF of steel workers. Electron microscopy and EDAX analysis of AB from steel workers revealed that the core fibers were mainly amphiboles. More ABs were found in the BALF of maintenance workers than in production workers. However, the BALF from steel workers who denied any contact with asbestos revealed an increased AB burden v. controls. This demonstrates that steel workers may be subject to an occult exposure to amphiboles in the steelplant environment.\r"

In this study a detailed review was performed with a computerized analysis of multiple clinical parameters in 73 patients treated for pyogenic hepatic abscess during a 17-year period. The mean age of the patients was 55 years and 38 of them (52%) were male. The mortality rate was comparable for solitary (17%) and multiple (23%) abscesses. The likelihood of death was higher with antibiotic treatment alone (45%) or percutaneous treatment (25%) than with surgical treatment (9.5%). The primary determinant of outcome, however, was the underlying disease, i.e., malignancy or an immunocompromised patient, rather than solitary versus multiple abscesses. In addition the incidence of hepatic abscess seen at this center has doubled from the first half to the second half of the review, reflecting a population of more severely ill patients. It is apparent that in current clinical practice several methods of management are effective, and the choice of therapy should be determined by individualized selection. The principle of timely diagnosis and prompt institution of treatment appropriate to the specific patient remains the standard of care in this potentially grave disease.\r"

  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a polypeptide produced predominantly by activated macrophages, is an important mediator of sepsis. We analyzed the specific metabolic changes that occur in the gut following TNF administration. Following general anesthesia, hemodynamic and metabolic indices were measured serially in control dogs (n = 7) and animals receiving a continuous sublethal intravenous infusion of TNF (0.57.10(5) IU/kg/6 hours, n = 7). During TNF infusion mean arterial pressure gradually decreased despite fluid administration, which maintained wedge pressure and cardiac index, which were similar to control animals. While TNF significantly reduced intestinal blood flow to 12 +/- 3 mL/min/kg compared to 28 +/- 3 mL/min/kg (p less than 0.01) in controls, intestinal oxygen consumption was maintained due to an increased extraction rate. Despite hypoperfusion the intestinal exchange of metabolic substrate (glucose, lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, and ammonia) was comparable between the control and TNF-infused animals. However, when substrate carbon balance across the intestinal tract was calculated, it appeared that there was a limitation in fuel availability in the TNF animals. This may be due to competition for fuel between the gut and other major organs. Fuel limitation may jeopardize rapid cell proliferation and mucosal repair and with regional hypoperfusion these processes may account for the mucosal ulcerations observed at the termination of the study.\r"

All patients underwent placement of seromuscular bipolar recording electrodes on the Roux limb, if present, stomach, jejunum, and colon at laparotomy. Group A was recorded before and after ambulation so comparisons could be made to determine if ambulation had an acute effect on myoelectric activity. Group A preambulation and group C recordings were compared to judge whether there was an over-all effect of ambulation on myoelectric recovery. No effect on slow wave frequency or percentage of slow waves with associated spike potentials was noted acutely or overall in the stomach, colon, or jejunum in continuity with the duodenal pacemaker. Transient increases in phase II spike activity in patients having a Roux limb and their jejunum distal to the enteroenterostomy were noted on postoperative days 1 to 2, but these differences resolved by postoperative days 3 or 4. The data suggest that ambulation as a means to help resolve postoperative ileus and its accompanying cramps and bloating may be more perceived than real.\r"

In the acute phase, 10 patients with severe dumping were studied over 2 consecutive days before and for 3 hours after the ingestion of a 'dumping breakfast' in a randomized double-blind fashion. On one day octreotide (100 micrograms) was given subcutaneously 30 minutes before the test meal and on the other day an equal volume of vehicle was injected. An additional group of six postgastrectomy patients without dumping were studied in a similar fashion and these acted as controls. During placebo treatment the test meal resulted in an immediate increase (p less than 0.01) in the pulse rate and in plasma levels of glucose, glucagon, pancreatic polypeptide, neurotensin, and insulin. Similar changes were seen in the control group with respect to placebo; however glucagon and neurotensin (p less than 0.05) did not show the same magnitude of increase as seen with placebo. Treatment with octreotide acetate prevented the development of both vasomotor and gastrointestinal symptoms and completely ablated all of the above responses in plasma peptides. These changes were associated with complete ablation of diarrhea (p less than 0.001). Pretreatment with octreotide acetate completely suppressed the rise in plasma insulin response to the meal and this ablated the late hypoglycemia of dumping. Treatment with octreotide acetate resulted in delayed gastric emptying and transit time (578 +/- 244 minutes) versus 76 +/- 23 minutes with placebo and 125 +/- 36 minutes in controls (p less than 0.05). Chronic daily treatment with octreotide acetate resulted in minimal side effects. These patients demonstrated a stable fasting plasma glucose, normal liver function tests, and an average weight gain of 11% during a 12-month period. In addition most patients were able to resume employment. The long-acting somatostatin analog, octreotide acetate, is highly effective in preventing the development of symptoms of severe dumping syndrome, both vasomotor and gastrointestinal.\r"

The major prostanoid released was 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and was three times higher in the shock group compared to the sham group (p less than 0.05). Reperfusion of shed blood abolished the increase in 6-keto-PGF1 alpha found in the shock group (p less than 0.05).

  ".W": "Acute lung injury characterized by increased microvascular permeability is one feature of multiple-organ system failure and the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury has been linked to this type of acute lung injury. The purpose of these experiments was to examine the pathogenic mediators that link the two processes, with particular emphasis on the roles of endotoxin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Previously described characteristics of the acute lung injury in this rat model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion include pulmonary neutrophil sequestration, depletion of lung tissue ATP, alveolar endothelial cell disruption, and increased microvascular permeability. Plasma levels of TNF in the systemic circulation of sham-operated animals and those with intestinal ischemic injury less than 60 minutes in duration were very low or undetectable. Intestinal ischemia for 120 minutes was associated with TNF elevation to 1.19 +/- 0.50 U/mL. Reperfusion for periods of 15 and 30 minutes generated 5- to 10-fold increases in circulating TNF levels (6.61 +/- 3.11 U/mL, p greater than 0.05 and 10.41 +/- 5.41 U/mL, p = 0.004 compared to sham); however this increase in circulating TNF was transient and largely cleared within 60 minutes after initiating reperfusion. Portal vein endotoxin levels were found to increase significantly before the appearance of TNF in systemic plasma, suggesting that gut-derived endotoxin may induce TNF release from hepatic macrophages into the systemic circulation. Anti-TNF antibody attenuated the increase in pulmonary microvascular permeability in this preparation but did not prevent pulmonary neutrophil sequestration. These observations suggest that endotoxin and TNF have pathogenic roles in this acute lung injury, but that mechanisms of adherence of neutrophils to endothelial cells independent of TNF may be involved. The accumulation of neutrophils in the lung but the prevention of a vascular permeability increase in the presence of antibody to TNF may imply an in vivo role for TNF in the process of neutrophil activation. These studies provide additional evidence of the importance of the endogenous inflammatory mediators in the development of systemic injury in response to local tissue injury.\r"

Anatomic injuries included right atrial rupture (13[40.6%]), left atrial rupture (8 [25%]), right ventricular rupture (10[31.3%]), left ventricular rupture (4[12.5%]), and rupture of two cardiac chambers (3 [9.4%]). Diagnosis was made by thoracotomy in all 20 patients presenting in cardiac arrest. In the remaining 12 patients, the diagnosis was established in seven by emergency left anterolateral thoracotomy and in five by subxyphoid pericardial window. Seven of these 12 patients (58.3%) had clinical cardiac tamponade and significant upper torso cyanosis. The mean Injury Severity Score (ISS), Trauma Score (TS), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were 33.8, 13.2, and 14.3, respectively, among survivors and 51.5, 8.3, and 7.0 for nonsurvivors. The overall mortality rate was 81.3% (26 of 32 patients), the only survivors being those presenting with vital signs (6 of 12 patients [50%]). All patients with rupture of two cardiac chambers or with ventricular rupture died. The mortality rate from myocardial rupture is very high. Rapid prehospital transportation, a high index of suspicion, and prompt surgical intervention contribute to survival in these patients.\r"

  ".W": "The incidence of peripheral vascular complications in 272 patients with aortic dissection during a 25-year span was determined, as was outcome after a uniform, aggressive surgical approach directed at repair of the thoracic aorta. One hundred twenty-eight patients (47%) presented with acute type A dissection, 70 (26%) with chronic type A, 40 (15%) with acute type B, and 34 (12%) with chronic type B dissections. Eighty-five patients (31%) sustained one or more peripheral vascular complications: Seven (3%) had a stroke, nine (3%) had paraplegia, 66 (24%) sustained loss of a peripheral pulse, 22 (8%) had impaired renal perfusion, and 14 patients (5%) had compromised visceral perfusion. Following repair of the thoracic aorta, local peripheral vascular procedures were unnecessary in 92% of patients who presented with absence of a peripheral pulse. The operative mortality rate for all patients was 25% +/- 3% (68 of 272 patients). For the subsets of individuals with paraplegia, loss of renal perfusion, and compromised visceral perfusion, the operative mortality rates (+/- 70% confidence limits) were high: 44% +/- 17% (4 of 9 patients), 50% +/- 11% (11 of 22 patients), and 43% +/- 14% (6 of 14 patients), respectively. The mortality rates were lower for patients presenting with stroke (14% +/- 14% [1 of 7 patients]) or loss of peripheral pulse (27% +/- 6% [18 of 66 patients]). Multivariate analysis revealed that impaired renal perfusion was the only peripheral vascular complication that was a significant independent predictor of increased operative mortality risk (p = 0.024); earlier surgical referral (replacement of the appropriate section of the thoracic aorta) or more expeditious diagnosis followed by surgical renal artery revascularization after a thoracic procedure may represent the only way to improve outcome in this high-risk patient subset. Early, aggressive thoracic aortic repair (followed by aortic fenestration and/or abdominal exploration with or without direct visceral or renal vascular reconstruction when necessary) can save some patients with compromised visceral perfusion; however, once visceral infarction develops the prognosis is also poor. Increased awareness of these devastating complications of aortic dissection and the availability of better diagnostic tools today may improve the survival rate for these patients in the future. The initial surgical procedure should include repair of the thoracic aorta in most patients.\r"

The relative risk was decreased during the first 19 years of follow-up (SIR = 0.75; 0.58, 0.96) and close to equal thereafter (SIR = 1.02; 0.79, 1.29). Sex, age at operation, type of operation, and diagnosis at operation (stomach or duodenal ulcer) did not affect the relative risk significantly. Confounding by socioeconomic status is one conceivable explanation for the decreased relative risk during the first years of follow-up, whereas the increasing risk with longer duration of follow-up might be a consequence of the surgical procedure itself.\r"

  ".U": "91076638\r", 
  ".W": "From 1977 to 1987, 1705 thermally injured patients were admitted to the Firefighters' Burn Center at the University of Alberta Hospitals. Thirteen hundred forty-four were male (78.8%) and 361 were female (21.2%), with a mean total burn surface area (TBSA) of 15.1 (SEM +/- 0.4%) and a range of 1% to 99% TBSA. Sixteen hundred thirty-five patients survived to be discharged from hospital, with an overall survival rate of 95.9%. One hundred twenty-four burn patients (7.3%) suffered concomitant inhalation injury diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Patients with inhalation injury suffered from larger TBSA (39.7% +/- 2.8% versus 12.2% +/- 0.3%; p less than 0.01) than those without inhalation injury. Inhalation injury increased the number of deaths from burn injury (34.7% versus 1.7%; p less than 0.01) independent of age and TBSA. Inhalation injury was associated with a threefold prolongation of hospital stay (23.7 +/- 0.7 versus 74.4 +/- 6.2 days; p less than 0.01) and was independent of age and TBSA. Multifactorial probit analysis was performed for both inhalation- and noninhalation-injured burned patients to allow TBSA and age adjusted rates of mortality for the burn population presented. The maximum detrimental effects of inhalation injury in burn patient outcome occurred when it coexisted with moderate (15% to 29% TBSA) to large (30% to 69% TBSA) thermal injuries. These data demonstrate that inhalation injury is an important comorbid factor in burn injury that increases the number of deaths substantially. Most importantly such injuries also independently prolong the duration of hospitalization in a highly unpredictable fashion as compared to patients with cutaneous burns only. As such our data illustrate the extreme importance of inhalation injury as a comorbid factor following thermal injury and reveal the present limitations for accurate quantification of the magnitude of respiratory tract injury accompanying thermal trauma.\r"

This study tests whether the rate of IL-2 administration modulates the onset of edema and examines thromboxane (Tx) and neutrophils as possible mediators of this event. Recombinant human IL-2, 10(5) U (n = 7), 10(6) U (n = 9), or vehicle (n = 8) were given to anesthetized rats intravenously during a period of 1 hour. At 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in wet to dry weight (w/d) ratio, was present in the heart, liver, and kidney, with 10(5) U IL-2 and in the lung, heart, liver and kidney, with 10(6) U IL-2, relative to values with vehicle-infused controls (all p less than 0.05). With a 1-hour infusion of 10(6) U IL-2, there was an increase in plasma thromboxane (Tx)B2 level to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL, higher than 481 +/- 93 pg/mL in control rats (p less than 0.05); lung polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 higher-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05); and increased bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to 460 micrograms/mL in controls (p less than 0.05). When 10(6) U IL-2 was given as a 1-minute intravenous bolus (n = 9), edema was not demonstrated, plasma TxB2 levels were similar to controls, there was no leukosequestration, and BAL protein levels were normal. These data indicate that a constant infusion but not the rapid bolus administration of IL-2 produces in rats multiple-system organ edema, increased plasma TxB2, sequestration of PMNs, and microvascular permeability. These findings may explain the early toxicity seen in patients given high-dose IL-2 in cancer treatment.\r"

Speed of left-hand finger tapping was also worse in Group I than groups II and III, but other standard neuropsychologic test findings failed to separate the groups. Specific brain lesion sites were not related to group membership. Impaired awareness of behavioral limitations after traumatic brain injury may be related to neuropsychologic changes not measured by standard tests. Bilateral impairment of heteromodal cortex may be important to this phenomenon when it exists several months or years postinjury.\r"

No data are available on the reliability of maximal exercise testing of mentally retarded individuals. The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability of graded exercise testing of mentally retarded adolescents and adults. The testing was conducted at two geographically different centers. At Center A, 14 mentally retarded adolescents (11 boys, three girls) with Down syndrome, who were educable or trainable, were recruited from a nonresidential school. The subjects completed two Balke-Ware treadmill protocols until exhaustion. The treadmill time and heart rate (HR) were recorded. The time between tests was approximately one week. At Center B, 21 mentally retarded adults (14 women, seven men means IQ = 56) were recruited from local workshops and group homes. These subjects completed a treadmill walking protocol, with metabolic measurements, until exhaustion. The time between tests varied from one to four months. At Center A, the subjects achieved a mean treadmill time of 8.72min on test one and 8.84min on test two (means HR = 174 and 175bpm, respectively). The reliability coefficient between the two tests was .94. At Center B, the subjects achieved a mean V0(2)max of 27.2mL.kg-1.min-1 on test one and 26.9mL.kg-1.min-1 on test two. The reliability coefficient was .93. These data show that maximal exercise testing is reliable for these populations of mentally retarded individuals, exhibiting similar values to their nonretarded peers.\r"

Early suspicion and knowledge of functional gait disorders may expedite the correct diagnosis and the institution of appropriate therapy, shortening hospital stay and eliminating unnecessary procedures. This case study reviews two patients with unique gait disturbances-astasia abasia and camptocormia. Astasia abasia is the inability to stand or walk in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities. Camptocormia is characterized by exaggerated trunk flexion of functional etiology. Both patients demonstrated rapid resolution of symptoms after psychiatric intervention.\r"

  ".W": "Retinal pigment epithelial tears are a major complication of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) in the elderly. We observed the pretear process of PED in 38 patients (40 eyes) to identify characteristic angiographic changes. Before the tear occurred, the filling pattern of the PED underwent alterations, including an increase in the size and a modification in the shape of the PED (27 eyes); the development of notches (14 eyes); and the onset or increase of subretinal fluid, hard exudates, and/or hemorrhages (30 eyes). The most noteworthy feature was the uneven filling of the PED, with a remarkably hypofluorescent central area that remained dark until the late angiographic frames (24 eyes). Conversely, hyperfluorescence appeared early at the margins of the PED, increased progressively, and sometimes demonstrated a crenated edge. The high risk of tearing indicates that laser treatment of the retina should be considered carefully in the presence of these angiographic features.\r"

Visual fields were abnormal in all cases. Although field loss was more pronounced in the superotemporal quadrant (P less than .001), it also involved the other three quadrants, thus demonstrating that optic nerve hypoplasia in tilted disc syndrome is apparently not entirely sectorial. Linear regression analysis showed that an increase in mean defect correlated with increase in myopic refractive error (P less than .05). However, the increase in myopic refractive error was found to be related to a decrease in corrected loss variance (P less than .05), indicating that in tilted discs with higher myopia, field loss is more homogeneous. With this series of patients, short-term fluctuation was within normal ranges in all visual fields, showing that this may be an additional clue for differential diagnosis from acquired disorders.\r"

Nineteen eyes (45%) without macular tumors or severe radiation complications had final visual acuities in the range of 20/20 to 20/50. One eye (2.4%) developed a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and four eyes (9.5%) were noted to have amblyopia after cataract removal. Three eyes (7%) developed retinoblastoma recurrence, one with extension of retinoblastoma into the subconjunctival space through the previous sclerotomy. Exenteration was performed and the patient was alive after 8 years. Cataract removal can be visually beneficial in selected patients with radiation-induced cataracts.\r"

Nineteen percent of applanation tonometers were outside the manufacturers' specifications (1 mm Hg of the calibration) and 4.5% were more than 2 mm Hg in error. The error was constant across the scale. Hand-held applanators were less accurate than those on slit lamps (P less than .02); the latter demonstrated an association between accuracy and age (P less than .05) and heavier use (P less than .01). Annual recalibration was performed in 86% of instruments. Those practitioners who themselves performed the calibration had the most accurate instruments.

The affected males showed the characteristic picture of cone dystrophy. Foveal cone photopigment density was impaired (judged from anomaloscope settings and foveal densitometry), even at an early stage of the disease. The carriers showed no fundus abnormalities, except occasional changes due to myopia. The anomaloscope demonstrated mild pseudoprotanomaly in 27 of 31 obligate carriers and in six of 13 possible carriers. Foveal densitometry findings performed in 11 carriers always agreed with the anomaloscope findings. We conclude that the findings of pseudoprotanomaly and abnormal density differences in females of this family were the only ocular abnormalities and thus are indicative of the carrier state.\r"

Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group. Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group. Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens.\r"

There was a significant association (P less than .001) between the grade of retinopathy and the level of posterior vitreous leakage. The amount of posterior vitreous leakage in each eye also had a significant association with borderline elevation of diastolic blood pressure. Subjects with excessive posterior vitreous leakage had significantly higher levels of urinary microalbumin excretion. In a multiple linear regression analysis for posterior vitreous leakage, retinal grade consistently entered the model at a significant level (P less than or equal to .00001 to .003). Blood pressure also entered the model for posterior vitreous leakage at a significant level for retinal grades of the right and left eyes and of the worst eye. These results demonstrate an association between leakage of retinal and renal vessels, possibly linked at least in part to elevation in diastolic blood pressure.\r"

The procedure uses a microsecond-pulsed-dye laser emitting at 666 nm and iontophoresis of methylene blue dye (absorption of 668 nm) into the sclera at the limbus to enhance the absorption of the laser light. We compared the number of pulses needed to perforate excised human sclera at pulse durations of 1.5, 20, and 300 microseconds. Pulse durations of 1.5 and 20 microseconds required 20 pulses or fewer to perforate excised human sclera with pulse energies of 75 to 100 mJ. The ab-interno laser sclerostomy procedure was performed in 54 eyes of Dutch-belted rabbits with pulse durations of 1.5 or 20 microseconds and a 100- or 200-microns incident spot diameter delivered using a CGF goniolens. Full-thickness fistulas were successfully created at both pulse durations in approximately 80% of eyes treated. A range of three to 25 pulses was required to perforate sclera with slightly fewer pulses and lower pulse energies at 1.5 microseconds compared with 20 microseconds. There were no significant complications from the procedure. This technique could permit filtration surgery to be performed on an outpatient basis.\r"

Eyes that had undergone phacoemulsification showed significant elevation of prostaglandin E2 at both postoperative periods compared with normal, phakic control eyes. The level of prostaglandin E2 was significantly (P less than .05) higher in eyes with posterior chamber lens implantation than in those without it, and was significantly (P less than .05) higher on the eighth than on the first postoperative day. The amount of leukotriene B4 was below the detection limit, except in the few eyes in which complications developed. Cyclooxygenase inhibitor eye drops significantly reduced the amount of prostaglandin E2 on both postoperative days, while steroid eye drops had no such effect.\r"

In 93% of the orbits, the cells extended anterior to the posterior lacrimal crest, with 40% entering the frontal process of the maxilla. This anatomic relationship may be used to facilitate the osteotomy during dacryocystorhinostomy. During a 10-year period (310 cases), one of us routinely entered the anterior ethmoid air cells to initiate the osteotomy during dacryocystorhinostomy. This technique has helped to avoid lacerations of the nasal mucosa.\r"

Previous investigations have shown that the ATIII genes in the majority of cases are grossly intact, but the precise underlying molecular defects remain unknown. We have investigated the molecular basis of a type 1 ATIII deficiency in an Italian kindred by enzymatic amplification of the ATIII gene sequences in affected family members and direct sequencing of the amplified genomic DNA. A novel mutation, the deletion of a single T in the second position of codon 119, was identified in each of the affected individuals. The resulting frameshift leads to a premature termination in codon 126, effectively resulting in a null allele.\r"

Addition of IL-2 therapy after BMT with FBM did not improve the results over BMT with FBM alone (P = .98). These results suggest that the GVL effect of ABMT can be enhanced by using ABM for BMT followed by IL-2 therapy without compromising engraftment.\r"

Remission induction therapy consisting of cytosine arabinoside and daunomycin was then administered to all patients, followed by three courses of consolidation to those who achieved complete remissions (CR). Older patients appeared to have more rapidly cycling cells (P = .003). No unique cell cycle characteristics were identified for patients who achieved remission versus those who had resistant disease. However, the pretherapy cell cycle characteristics were a strong prognosticator for remission duration. CR patients were divided into those whose leukemic cell Tc were above median (A) and below median (B). Among 14 B patients, median duration of response was 211 days, and all relapsed by day 600. Among 18 A patients, the median has not as yet been reached, with nine patients in continuous complete remission (log rank P = .007, Wilcoxon P = .04). We conclude that cell cycle characteristics of leukemic cells play a role in determining remission duration, perhaps because the leukemic cells of the former patients regrow slowly between courses of chemotherapy.\r"

Two cell lines representing different stages of differentiation were used (HL-60, promyelocytic, and THP-1, mature monocytic). In accordance with previous studies, it was observed that a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was a sufficient stimulus for induction of the IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IL-1 beta protein production in both of these cell lines. A structural analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or agents elevating the endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E2, forskolin) were not alone able to induce IL-1 beta expression, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta production and IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation. Nuclear run off analysis showed that this elevation in IL-1 beta mRNA levels was due to an increased rate of transcription. If dbcAMP was added 6 hours before PMA to the cultures, no enhancement in the IL-1 beta production was seen, implying that for this enhancing effect both of these signals must be present simultaneously. PKC inhibitor, H7, also blocked effectively the PMA plus dbcAMP induced IL-1 beta production, while the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, HA1004, had no effect, suggesting that PKA activation is not involved in the mechanism of action of cAMP in this case. Collectively, the present findings show that cAMP-dependent signals can have a positive regulatory effect on the PKC-dependent activation of the IL-1 beta gene in cells derived from different stages of myeloid differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Erythropoietin (Epo) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are believed to induce the differentiation of transformed erythroid cells by different signal transduction pathways. We have now obtained evidence for the interaction of these pathways. We used a Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cell line with a relatively low (8% to 10%) hemoglobinization response to Epo alone. Pretreatment of these cells for 1 day with DMSO followed by its removal and the addition of Epo resulted in a marked enhancement of the Epo specific hemoglobinization. We have designated this effect \"DMSO priming.\" This priming effect of DMSO on the Epo response was both time-dependent and DMSO concentration-dependent. DMSO priming potentiated the Epo response in three ways. Firstly, DMSO priming increased the total number of Epo responsive cells from 8% to 10% to 40% to 60%. Secondly, DMSO priming reduced the time required to reach the optimal Epo-induced response from 4 days to 2 days. Thirdly, the Epo dose-response curve was left-shifted approximately 20-fold. DMSO priming was also associated with a marked increase in Epo receptor density characterized by an apparently new receptor population and by the appearance of positive cooperativity between receptors. Our results suggest that the DMSO priming effect is due to potentiation of the Epo signaling pathway, thus resulting in a much more rapid and dramatic Epo-induced hemoglobinization response.\r"

Because of the clinical toxicities associated with chronic Urd administration, the ability of benzylacyclouridine (BAU) to effect, in vivo, AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia was assessed. This agent inhibits Urd catabolism and, in vivo, increases the plasma concentration of Urd in a dose-dependent manner, without Urd-related toxicity. In mice rendered anemic and leukopenic by the administration of AZT for 28 days in drinking water (1.5 mg/mL), the continued administration of AZT plus daily BAU (300 mg/kg, orally) partially reversed AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia (P less than .05), increased peripheral reticulocytes (to 4.9%, P less than .01), increased cellularity in the marrow, and improved megaloblastosis. When coadministered with AZT from the onset of drug administration, BAU reduced AZT-induced marrow toxicity. In vitro, at a concentration of 100 mumol/L, BAU possesses minimal anti-HIV activity and has no effect on the ability of AZT to reverse the HIV-induced cytopathic effect in MT4 cells. The clinical and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "It has been reported that in vitro uridine (Urd) can reverse azidothymidine (AZT) cytotoxicity without decreasing anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) activity. Our studies in mice have shown that daily oral doses of benzylacyclouridine (BAU), an inhibitor of Urd breakdown, also reduces AZT hematologic toxicity, presumably by elevating the plasma concentration of Urd. We now extend these murine studies and report the effect of various doses of exogenous Urd, various doses of BAU, or the combination of BAU and Urd, administered daily, on AZT-induced toxicity. In mice receiving concomitant AZT, daily doses of Urd of 1,000 to 2,000 mg/kg increase peripheral reticulocytes and slightly reduce AZT-induced hematologic toxicity. However, the range of effective doses is narrow, and higher doses of Urd (greater than 3,000 mg/kg/d) significantly enhance hematologic toxicity. At its most effective dose, (2,000 mg/kg/d), Urd produces 28% mortality. In contrast, BAU doses up to 300 mg/kg/d reduced AZT-related hematologic toxicity in a dose-dependent manner without mortality. Higher daily doses of BAU and the combination of BAU with low doses of Urd were not more effective. Studies conducted in mice infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) indicate that BAU does not impair the antiretroviral effect of AZT when administered at doses that reduce AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia. These findings may be significant for the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex.\r"

We report here data concerning a long-term clinical survey (5 to 18 years with a median of 12 years) including 156 nongrafted patients receiving androgen therapy; all patients were alive more than 5 years after diagnosis (40% of patients included at time of diagnosis in our multicentric analysis). Between the 5th and the 13th year follow-up, 21 patients died of various causes either related to AA or to its treatment: 12 of infection or hemorrhage secondary to pancytopenia (6 relapses and 6 that had never been improved; 2 with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria [PNH]); 5 of leukemia; 1 of a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 2 of late side effects following transfusion (1 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and 1 chronic B hepatitis); and a single case of myocardial infarction (the latter could possibly result of androgen therapy). Thirteen patients in total developed PNH (among which 10 had clinical symptoms including 2 deaths, and 3 exhibited only biologic abnormalities). Few long-term side effects of androgens could be noticed. Adult height was normal in patients treated during childhood and so was young women's fertility. No malignant hepatoma occurred. This survey allows the recording of late spontaneous hematologic improvement (between 5 and 10 years of evolution). This occurred in 50% of patients that had remained cytopenic 5 years after diagnosis. Although bone marrow stem cell concentration remained abnormal after 10 years of evolution. 85% of patients had a normal red blood cell count, 80% a normal polymorphonuclear count, and 66% a normal platelet count. All patients who did not show late complications had an excellent quality of life.\r"

The nucleotide sequence of the RhIL-3 gene displayed 92.9% homology with that of the human IL-3 (hIL-3) gene. The isolated RhIL-3 gene encodes a 143-amino acid (aa) precursor polypeptide, nine C-terminal residues shorter than the human protein. Protein homology was found to be 89.5% for the signal peptide (19 aa) and 80.5% for the mature protein (124 aa). Comparison of the human and RhIL-3 coding sequences showed that the majority of substitutions had occurred at amino acid replacement sites indicating a rapid evolution of the IL-3 protein. After expression of a genomic fragment in COS cells, RhIL-3 cDNA was constructed, which enabled large-scale production of the RhIL-3 polypeptide, RhIL-3 produced by Bacillus licheniformis and purified to homogeneity appeared to be approximately 100-fold more effective in stimulating Rhesus monkey hematopoietic progenitors than hIL-3, whereas RhIL-3 and hIL-3 showed comparable stimulatory activity on normal as well as malignant human hematopoietic cells. Thus, the rapid evolution of hIL-3 has resulted in a unidirectional species specificity, which most likely restricts the in vivo effects of hIL-3 in Macaca species.\r"

Laboratory analysis showed mild fibrinolysis, minimal effect of coumadin therapy, and a prolonged thrombin time (greater than 150 seconds using bovine IIa). When purified human IIa was used the thrombin time normalized to within 17 seconds of controls, suggesting a possible inhibitor of bovine IIa. An anti-IIa antibody was isolated by protein A-Sepharose (Sigma, St Louis, MO) chromatography followed by affinity chromatography using a bovine IIa-Sepharose column. The effects of this purified anti-IIa antibody on both bovine and human IIa procoagulant and anticoagulant functions were studied. The isolated immunoglobulin G (IgG) was observed to inhibit bovine IIa in all assays tested. This IgG was also able to slightly prolong fibrinogen clotting by human IIa. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay it was observed that the IgG bound to bovine IIa, bovine II, human IIa, but not to human II. Further, binding was detectable at approximately 50-fold lower concentrations to bovine IIa (1 nmol/L IgG concentration) than to human IIa (50 nmol/L IgG concentration). The effect of the antibody on the reaction between IIa and AT III/heparin was investigated. Human IIa was found to be protected from AT III/heparin neutralization in the presence of this antibody. These results suggest that this patient developed an antibody that strongly binds to and inhibits the bovine IIa in all assays tested. However, the antibody only significantly affects human IIa neutralization by AT III/heparin, and has little effect on the human IIa procoagulant activity. These data suggest that the decreased effect of AT III/heparin on this patient's IIa may have been a contributing factor in his coagulopathy. The exact cause of this antibody development is unclear, but the role of bovine topical thrombin used during cardiac valve replacement surgery is suspect.\r"

  ".W": "A microperfusion system containing a glass capillary, the inner surface of which is coated with a phospholipid bilayer containing tissue factor, was used to explore the requirement for factors VIIa and Xa in the complex formed with the lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI). Various combinations of factors VIIa, Xa, and LACI were perfused together or sequentially at a wall shear rate of 300 sec-1; a final perfusion of factors X and VIIa was performed to evaluate the residual tissue factor activity. Factor Xa concentration at the outlet of the tube was determined using a chromogenic substrate. In the presence of factors VIIa, Xa, and LACI, complete inhibition of tissue factor was observed on both phosphatidylcholine (neutral surfaces) and on phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine (acidic) surfaces; omission of factors Xa or LACI resulted in no inhibition. The absence of factor VIIa in the initial perfusion steps resulted in no inhibition on neutral surfaces whereas about 90% inhibition was observed on acidic surfaces. Initial perfusion with factor Xa, but not LACI, followed by the remaining protein components, resulted in an inhibitory complex. Thus, it appears that a tissue factor:factor Xa:LACI complex can form in the absence of factor VIIa on acidic surfaces; moreover, our data imply a tissue factor binding site for factor Xa, but not for LACI.\r"

  ".W": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured on a collagen lattice were used to study the effects of the interaction between human monocytes and endothelial cells on the production of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) by endothelial cells. The effects of adherence and transendothelial migration of monocytes on endothelial PAI-1 release were compared with those of other leukocytes, conditioned media from monocytes, and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta). Because the cell culture system used allows simultaneous analysis of the lumenal and the subendothelial compartment of endothelial cell monolayers, we also studied into which direction PAI-1 is released by endothelial cells. Under quiescent conditions, the net amount of PAI-1 accumulated at the lumenal side was twofold higher than that accumulated at the subendothelial side (about 2.0 micrograms PAI-1/10(6) cells and 1.1 microgram PAI-1/10(6) cells, respectively, in 24 hours), as analyzed by a quantitative immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Direct cell-cell contact between highly purified monocytes and endothelial cells strongly enhanced the PAI-1 release by endothelial cells in a dose-dependent way, whereas lymphocytes and neutrophils did not affect endothelial PAI-1 production. The monocyte-mediated increase was first detected after 12 hours of incubation and lasted for at least 48 hours. In the presence of two monocytes per endothelial cell, the increases of PAI-1 at the lumenal side and at the subendothelial side were 87% and 32% in 24 hours, respectively. The effect of IL-1 beta on PAI-1 release by endothelial cells closely resembled that observed for monocytes. Monocyte-conditioned medium contained heat-labile product(s) which also, although to a much lesser extent than intact monocytes, enhanced endothelial PAI-1 release. Similarly, monocytes cultured on top endothelial cell separated by a microporous filter enhanced the release of PAI-1 to a lesser extent. Thus, these findings indicate that monocytes enhance endothelial PAI-1 release by mechanisms that are, at least in part, dependent on cell-cell contact.\r"

In fact, several reports misidentified the functional defect of Baltimore I, which has impaired fibrin monomer polymerization. Reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of lysyl endopeptidase digest of the purified Baltimore I gamma-chain showed an abnormal peptide not found in the co-existing normal gamma-chain of this heterozygote. Amino acid sequencing of this peptide indicated that gamma-chain Gly292 is replaced by valine. This observation was confirmed, and the genetic defect was determined by direct nucleotide sequencing of a polymerase chain reaction product containing codon gamma 292, which is mutated: GGC----GTC. The molecular defect of Fibrinogen Baltimore I lies in a region of the gamma-chain required for fibrin polymerization, suggesting that the integrity of gamma Gly292 is critical for fibrin assembly.\r"

The radioiodinated-free inhibitors had biologic half-lives of 23.4 and 62.1 hours, respectively, while the corresponding *I-labeled activated-protein C complexes were cleared with half-lives of 19.6 +/- 3.1 and 72.2 +/- 6.1 minutes. Complex clearances were linked to their catabolism as shown by a correlation between clearance and the appearance of free radioiodine in the plasma. Thus, the difference in the rates of catabolism would result in a fivefold greater amount of alpha 1-AT-APC complex than PCI-APC complex 1 hour after the formation of equal amounts of these in vivo. These results lead to the conclusion that the relative contribution of PCI and alpha 1-AT to the physiologic inhibition of APC cannot be determined only from the rates of the formation of these complexes in vitro, or from measurement of their levels in plasma. The APC-PCI complex is unstable as compared with the APC-alpha 1-AT complex, compounding the problem of estimating rates of complex formation from their levels in plasma.\r"

The antibody reacted strongly with the child's and father's platelets, but not with platelets of the mother or with those of a highly selected panel representing all known platelet alloantigens. Platelets from 300 unselected normal blood donors also tested negative, suggesting a phenotype frequency in the German population of less than 0.01. The antigen was present in 9 of 20 members within three generations of the paternal family, indicating autosomal codominant inheritance. By immunochemical analysis using a glycoprotein (GP)-specific immunoassay and a variety of GP IIb/IIIa-specific monoclonal antibodies for antigen immobilization (MAIPA assay), radioimmunoassay, and Western blotting, we could show that the antigen resides on a 68-Kd proteolytic fragment of GP IIIa. Immunogenetic data and gene dosage studies revealed that the Sra antigen is not related to any of the other known platelet alloantigens. In accordance with established criteria, the Sra antigen represents the first example of a \"private\" platelet alloantigen that bears significance in rare instances of NAIT.\r"

  ".W": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine produced in monocytes, fibroblasts, and other cell types, is induced by a variety of stimuli, including bacteria, viruses, and other cytokines. When normal monocyte cultures were exposed to a monocytotropic strain of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), HTLV-IIIBa-L, significant levels of IL-6 bioactivity were detected in the culture supernatants after 12 to 43 days of incubation, at a time when there was associated evidence of HIV production. Similarly, when normal monocyte cultures were cocultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HIV-infected individuals, HIV replication in these cultures was associated with production of IL-6. In further studies, we determined that mean serum levels of IL-6 bioactivity were abnormally elevated in HIV-seropositive individuals with stage 1/2 infection (25.2 x/divided by 1.8 U/mL) and stage 3/4 infection (46.1 x/divided by 1.7 U/mL) when compared with normals (1.6 x/divided by 1.2 U/mL). In contrast mean serum IL-6 levels were not different from normal in stage 5/6 infection (2.7 x/divided by 1.6 U/mL). A selected group of 12 HIV-seropositive individuals (stages 1, 2, and 3) who harbored HIV capable of replicating in T cells but not in monocyte cultures had a mean serum IL-6 level of 5.3 U/mL (x/divided by 1.5), a value significantly lower (P less than .004) than that measured in control HIV-seropositive individuals infected with monocytropic HIV (39 x/divided by 1.9 U/mL). In addition, serum IL-6 levels in HIV-seropositive individuals (stages 1 through 6) correlated directly with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels (R = .74, P less than .001). Monocytes but not T cells are capable of a high level IL-6 production in vitro, and monocyte-derived IL-6 stimulates Ig production in activated B cells. Thus, HIV-seropositive individuals who often are infected with monocytotropic HIV and often display abnormally elevated serum IgG levels may exhibit these abnormalities as a consequence of abnormally elevated IL-6 levels induced by HIV.\r"

  ".W": "Marrow stromal elements produce as yet uncharacterized soluble growth factors that can stimulate the proliferation of murine pre-B cells, although close contact between these two cell types appears to ensure a better pre-B cell response. We have now shown that freshly isolated normal pre-B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu- fraction of adult mouse bone marrow) adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site, as shown in a serum-free adherence assay, and they lose this functional ability on differentiation in vivo into B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu+ fraction). Similarly, cells from an immortalized but stromal cell-dependent and nontumorigenic murine pre-B cell line originally derived from a Whitlock-Witte culture were also found to adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site. Moreover, in the presence of anti-FN receptor antibodies, the ability of this immortalized pre-B cell line to proliferate when co-cultured with a supportive stromal cell line (M2-10B4 cells) was markedly reduced (down to 30% of control). This suggests that pre-B cell attachment to FN on stromal cells may be an important component of the mechanism by which stromal cells stimulate normal pre-B cell proliferation and one that is no longer operative to control their more differentiated progeny. Two differently transformed pre-B cell lines, both of which are autocrine, stromal-independent, tumorigenic in vivo, and partially or completely differentiation-arrested at a very early stage of pre-B cell development, did not bind to FN. In addition, anti-FN receptor antibodies were much less effective in diminishing the ability of these tumorigenic pre-B cells to respond to M2-10B4 cell stimulation, which could still be demonstrated when the tumorigenic pre-B cells were co-cultured with M2-10B4 cells at a sufficiently low cell density. Analysis of cell surface molecules immunoprecipitated from both the nontumorigenic and tumorigenic pre-B cell lines by an anti-FN receptor antibody showed an increase in very late antigen (VLA) alpha chain(s) in both tumorigenic pre-B cell lines and a decrease in the beta 1 chain in one. Interestingly, all of the pre-B cell lines expressed similar amounts of messenger RNA for the beta 1 chain of the FN receptor. These results suggest that alteration of FN receptor expression on pre-B cells may represent a mechanism contributing to the outgrowth of leukemic pre-B cells with an autocrine phenotype and capable of stromal cell-independent, autonomous growth.\r"

  ".W": "The knowledge about drug resistance in childhood leukemias and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in general is limited. This is because of the lack of a suitable in vitro drug sensitivity assay, which is in part due to low in vitro ALL cell survival. We recently adapted the highly efficient 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to test cells from ALL patients and showed that its results were comparable with those of the DiSC assay, up to now the most valid but laborious assay. In this study, in vitro drug sensitivity was assessed in cells from 82 children with leukemia, 79 of whom had ALL, with the MTT assay. Dose response curves were obtained for 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), prednisolone (Pred), daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), L-asparaginase (L-Asp), mafosfamide, and mustine. A cytotoxic effect of methotrexate could be detected in only a few cases. Large interindividual differences in drug sensitivity were detected. Compared with leukemia cells from newly diagnosed patients, leukemia cells from relapsed patients were significantly more in vitro resistant to 6-TG, Pred, Ara-C, mafosfamide and mustine but not to DNR, VCR, and L-Asp. Improvements of culture medium and methods to increase MTT reduction were studied. From 10 components tested, addition of insulin and bovine serum albumin to serum-containing medium improved ALL cell survival. Addition of succinate did not increase the amount of MTT reduction. We conclude that the in vitro MTT assay highly facilitates large-scale studies on drug resistance of ALL patients that can lead to rational improvements in existing treatment protocols.\r"

However, some patients are resistant and others develop late resistance to the IFN-alpha treatment. To understand the molecular mechanism of this resistance, we have analyzed the expression of 10 IFN-inducible genes in the cells of three resistant patients, two responsive patients, and six healthy controls. Northern blot hybridizations showed that all the genes were induced in in vitro IFN-alpha treated peripheral blood cells of the patients and healthy controls. These genes were also inducible in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of two out of two resistant patients administered an injection of IFN-alpha. We conclude that the resistance to the IFN-alpha treatment of the chronic myeloid leukemia patients we studied is not due to (1) the absence of induction of any of the 10 IFN-inducible genes we studied, including the low-molecular-weight 2'-5'oligoadenylate synthetase; (2) the presence of an antagonist of IFN-alpha in the peripheral blood or bone marrow cells; and (3) the presence of neutralizing anti-IFN-alpha antibodies.\r"

Of the 20 patients, all 14 patients who were 3 years old and less were diagnosed as having acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) by use of platelet-specific monoclonal antibodies and platelet peroxidase (PPO) reaction in electron microscopy. They were characterized by the presence of bone marrow fibrosis, having a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a poor response to chemotherapy. Only one patient has remained in continuous complete remission for more than 1 year. Acute leukemia in six patients who were older than 4 years was classified as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In one of six patients classified as ALL, the leukemic blasts simultaneously expressed myeloid-associated surface antigens. All six patients achieved a complete remission and have remained in continuous complete remission and have remained in continuous complete remission from 10 to 52 months from the initial diagnosis. Although it has been suggested that the distribution of types of acute leukemia in patients with DS is similar to that in normal children, the present study shows that the distribution of acute leukemia types is quite different from that in patients without Down's syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the potential role of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) in patients receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy, we measured the endogenous levels of Epo in 31 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Seventeen patients underwent allogeneic BMT and 14 underwent autologous BMT. On average, 10 +/- 4 units of red blood cells (RBCs) were transfused per patient. The mean RBC transfusion requirement of the autologous BMT patients was significantly greater than that of the allogeneic recipients (12 +/- 3 v 8 +/- 4, P less than .01), although both groups were maintained at comparable hematocrits. Epo levels were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). For each patient, baseline serum Epo levels were determined at time of admission to the hospital. Subsequent samples were collected within 24 hours of completing chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, and on days 7, 14, and 28, after BMT. Hematocrits (Hcts) were measured daily. All patients had an initial serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL. Despite considerable differences in absolute Epo levels among individuals, a characteristic pattern was observed. Following admission to the hospital and initiation of cytotoxic therapy, the average Hct decreased and the average Epo level initially increased. The mean serum Epo levels peaked on day 7 post-BMT (284 +/- 190 mU/mL) and fell steadily thereafter. While the average Hcts on day 7 and on day 28 post-BMT were not significantly different (28 +/- 4.6% v 29 +/- 3.3%, respectively), the average serum Epo levels decreased fourfold (P less than .01) during this same period. Moreover, day 28 post-BMT mean Epo levels were inappropriately low (P less than .05) when compared with a reference population with bone marrow failure and normal controls who had not received cytotoxic therapy. We conclude that the endogenous Epo response appears to be blunted during the 3 to 4 weeks immediately post-BMT. Therefore, clinical trials assessing the efficacy of the administration of rhEpo in the treatment of anemias associated with cytotoxic therapy are warranted.\r"

The patients' ages ranged from 46 to 81 years (median 62). Eleven had palpable splenomegaly, five with markedly enlarged spleens; only one patient had generalized lymphadenopathy. The white blood cell count ranged from 5.2 to 131.0 x 10(9)/L (median 20.8). The morphologic diagnosis in all cases was CLL, with the cells usually having abundant cytoplasm. No morphologic features, of hairy cells were evident; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase cytochemistry was negative in all cases. Bone marrow biopsies were available in 8 of 14. Four showed focal nodular infiltrates and two had diffuse infiltrates similar to CLL; two showed only minimal interstitial involvement. All cases expressed multiple B-cell markers, and 12 of 14 had monoclonal surface immunoglobulin. The leukemic cells of all cases strongly expressed CD11c, while CD5 was expressed in 7 of 14; only 1 of the 14 cases expressed the lymph node homing receptor, Leu-8. This unique group of leukemias appears to represent the malignant transformation of lymphocytes arising from a stage of lymphocyte differentiation between that found in typical cases of CLL and that of HCL. CD11c is known to have an important function in cellular adhesion and may be important in determining the pattern of lymphocyte tissue distribution found in this group of patients.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of constituents of human platelets on leukocyte adherence was examined. Adherence-inhibiting factors (AIFs), which strongly inhibited neutrophil adherence to glass, were present in both cytosol and granule fractions of human platelets. On the Superose 6 gel chromatography (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden), the granular AIF was eluted as a single active peak (2,600 Kd), whereas cytosolic AIFs were eluted at two different positions (2,600 and 480 Kd). When platelets were stimulated by thrombin, granular AIF was released extracellularly without releasing a cytosolic marker. Using DE32 anion exchange chromatography and Superose 6 gel filtration, granular AIF was completely purified. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis suggests that granular AIF consists of two subunits with molecular masses of approximately 340 and 190 Kd. Purified granular AIF inhibited human neutrophil adherence to glass, plastic, and type IV collagen-coated plastic, whereas it did not affect monocyte adherence. These results suggest that granular AIF inhibits neutrophil adherence not only via nonspecific adsorption sites, but also via type IV collagen receptors.\r"

  ".U": "91077450\r", 
  ".W": "The Leu-8 molecule, the human homologue of the murine MEL-14 peripheral lymph node homing receptor, is expressed on neutrophils in both species and may be important in localization of cells to sites of inflammation. Most circulating human neutrophils express the Leu-8 molecule, and activation of neutrophils with phorbol myristate acetate causes a rapid decline in Leu-8 membrane fluorescence staining within 15 minutes. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from neutrophils demonstrated two species of Leu-8 messenger RNA, a major one of 2.4 kb and a minor one of 1.9 kb. Because two different Leu-8 cDNA clones were obtained from human lymphocytes that were predicted to encode both transmembrane and phosphatidylinositol (PI)-anchored forms of the molecule, experiments were conducted to determine whether Leu-8 is anchored to neutrophils by a PI-anchor. There was a slight decrease in expression of Leu-8 on neutrophils when they were treated with PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). However, Leu-8 was abundant on neutrophils obtained from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. To determine the fate of the Leu-8 molecule during cell activation, neutrophils were labeled with 125I-anti-Leu-8. During activation antibody was rapidly lost from the cell surface and was not internalized, suggesting that Leu-8 is released from the cell membrane during cell activation. When cell extracts of neutrophils were compared with extracts of lymphoid cells by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, the Leu-8 species expressed on neutrophils had a significantly higher and more variable relative mobility (70 to 120 Kd for neutrophils v 70 Kd for Jurkat T cells). In addition, Leu-8 molecules were detected in the supernatants of activated neutrophils. These results indicate that human neutrophils express a high-molecular-weight form of the Leu-8 molecule that has a conventional transmembrane anchor and is rapidly released from the membrane during activation. The loss of the Leu-8 membrane glycoprotein during activation may be a mechanism for rapid alteration of neutrophil adhesion characteristics.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the oral efficacy and the acute toxicity of hydroxypyridin-4-one iron chelators has been investigated to clarify structure-function relationships of these compounds in vivo and to identify compounds with the maximum therapeutic safety margin. By comparing 59Fe excretion following oral or intraperitoneal administration of increasing doses of each chelator to iron-overloaded mice, the most effective compounds have been identified. These have partition coefficients (Kpart) above 0.3 in the iron-free form with a trend of increasing oral efficacy with increasing Kpart values (r = .6). However, this is achieved at a cost of increasing acute toxicity, as shown by a linear correlation between 59Fe excretion increase per unit dose and 1/LD50 (r = .83). A sharp increase in the LD50 values is observed for compounds with Kpart values above 1.0, suggesting that such compounds are unlikely to possess a sufficient therapeutic safety margin. Below a Kpart of 1.0, acute toxicity is relatively independent of lipid solubility. All the compounds are less toxic by the oral route than by the intraperitoneal route, although iron excretion is not significantly different by these two routes. At least five compounds (CP51, CP94, CP93, CP96, and CP21) are more effective orally than the same dose of intraperitoneal desferrioxamine (DFO) (P less than or equal to .02) or orally administered L1(CP20) (P less than or equal to .02).\r"

A monoclonal mouse antibody against human transferrin receptor was bound to magnetic beads conjugated with sheep antimouse antibody. The recovery of reticulocytes from peripheral blood was 15% to 42%. Blood used for isolation of reticulocytes could be stored for 4 days at 22 degrees C without altering the yield of reticulocytes. At 37 degrees C incubation, the reticulocytes matured rapidly and the transferrin receptor was found to have a half-life of 16 hours. The activity of several enzymes and the amount of creatine and hemoglobin A1C were measured both in the reticulocytes and peripheral blood. Of the enzymes, porphobilinogen deaminase had the best discriminatory power with a ratio of 8.8 between reticulocytes and peripheral red blood cells. The ratio for creatine was 16.7. The ability to isolate pure human reticulocytes, released after normal erythropoiesis, will offer new possibilities in the study of these cells.\r"

  ".U": "91077453\r", 
  ".W": "Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome-positive clonogenic progenitors usually disappear within 4 to 6 weeks in long-term cultures established from the marrow of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In contrast, coexisting chromosomally normal hematopoietic cells are relatively well maintained. Thus, even though normal cells are initially undetectable, they may become the predominant population. Recently, we have begun to explore the potential of such cultures as a strategy for preparing CML marrow for autografting, and based on cytogenetic studies of the differential kinetics of Ph1-positive and Ph1-negative clonogenic cells, have chosen a 10-day period in culture to obtain maximal numbers of selectively enriched normal stem cells. Here we present the results of molecular analyses of the cells regenerated in vivo for the initial three CML patients to be treated using this approach by comparison with the differentiated cells generated by continued maintenance of an aliquot of the autograft in vitro (using a slightly modified culture feeding procedure to enhance the production and release of cells into the nonadherent fraction after 4 weeks) for the one patient whose genotype made molecular analysis of clonality status also possible. These analyses showed that cells with a rearranged breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene were not detectable by Southern blotting in either in vitro or in vivo populations of mature cells that might be assumed to represent the progeny of primitive cells present at the end of the initial 10 days in culture. Production of BCR-negative cells was also shown to be temporally correlated with the appearance of nonclonal hematopoietic cells both in culture and in vivo. These findings provide support for the view that prolonged maintenance of CML marrow cells in long-term culture may allow molecular characterization of both the BCR-genotype and clonality status of cells with in vivo regenerative potential.\r"

  ".W": "Recurrence of the underlying malignancy remains a major cause of treatment failure after autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for patients with lymphoma. In this regard, we have developed an immunotherapeutic approach designed to induce resistance against residual tumor cells persisting after BMT. Previous studies in the model system of 38C13, a lethal B-cell lymphoma of C3H origin, have shown that active immunization with purified tumor-derived surface immunoglobulin (Id), as a tumor-associated antigen, produces resistance to tumor growth. Id immunization of lethally irradiated mice at 3 or 5 weeks after reconstitution with syngeneic bone marrow resulted in significantly prolonged survival after tumor challenge compared with nonspecifically immunized controls. Low levels of idiotype-specific antibody were also demonstrated in the sera of specifically immunized mice at this early time, when other functional studies in the literature of immunocompetence after syngeneic reconstitution might have predicted incomplete recovery. Immunization of mice before lethal irradiation and syngeneic marrow reconstitution also induced significant resistance to tumor challenge, suggesting the persistence of established host antitumor immunity through total body irradiation. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of id immunization in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation.\r"

RA SF PMN alone showed a decrease in basal NADPH-oxidase activity as well as an increase in responsiveness to stimulation by chemotactic peptide during culture. Stimulation of PMN with phorbol-12-myrisitate-13-acetate evoked equivalent responses in each population before and after culture. These results demonstrate a major difference in resting and receptor-mediated activation of superoxide release by RA SF PMN. Together, these results have important implications in identifying the role of the activated PMN in RA.\r"

However, the arthroscopic and immunohistopathological signs of synovitis were no different.\r"

The present study is of the incidence of ISLE and acetylator status in a mixed population of Malaysia. The results did not support an association between ISLE and acetylator status: the frequencies of slow acetylators in the ISLE patients who were Malaysian Chinese and Malay were 13 and 38% respectively. This did not differ significantly from the respective healthy groups (20 and 29%). The small number of Indians in the survey did not allow a valid comparison, but the figures did suggest a lack of association between ISLE and acetylator status.\r"

Of 21 patients entered into the study, 10 successfully completed 6 months of therapy; five developed adverse effects, four withdrew for reasons unrelated to drug treatment and two stopped because of inefficacy. No serious adverse effects were reported. A statistically significant improvement in most clinical assessments was observed from weeks 8-12 onwards. Significant improvement in plasma viscosity was observed and there was a trend towards improvement in serum CRP, histidine and IgM concentrations. There was a good correlation between mean serial changes in clinical and biochemical assessments indicating that the drug may exhibit the properties of a second-line agent. Median steady-state serum concentrations of methylsulphasalazine and methylsulphapyridine were 26.6 micrograms/ml and 2.85 micrograms/ml respectively.\r"

  ".W": "A consensus view has been obtained from 108 colleagues about four major questions relating to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (OA) posed by a retired judge. In determining the likelihood of OA developing after a fracture, several factors must be taken into account. These include whether the fracture goes through the joint, the resulting angular deformity, the degree of soft tissue damage, the ensuing laxity of the joint, the presence of generalized OA, the involvement of nearby blood vessels supplying the bones of the joint and possibly the degree of immobilization. Lower limb joints are more likely to develop arthritis after injury than arm joints as they carry more load (although it would be wrong to think that arm joints were not load bearing). Occupation is a further factor. Age is thought to be important, with the elderly more at risk immediately, but the younger having longer in which to develop the disease. Younger people are less likely to develop post-traumatic OA, unless there is involvement of the epiphysis or residual angular deformity. Whilst in animals and in some fractures, degenerative changes begin immediately after damage to the joint, in most adults they take at least 2 years. The span is 2-5 years in more severe cases, including fractures of the joint line with a step in the surface, and associated dislocation. Otherwise it may take 10 years. Most of these data are anecdotal or obtained from retrospective surveys. There is great need for prospective work in this field.\r"

Highest and most persistent antibody titers to this antigen are found in patients with ASGN. Immunoaffinity isolated ESS was injected i.v. into the tail vein of Wistar Furth (W/FU) rats for up to five successive days. The animals were sacrificed on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12. Frozen sections of the rat kidneys were tested by immunofluorescence against rabbit anti-ESS-antibody and against sera from patients who had recently recovered from ASGN as well as against anti-rat-IgG and C3. The basement membranes of rat kidneys were positive for ESS deposition starting from day one on, but were negative for anti-rat IgG and C3 during the first four days. Rats sacrificed on days 8-12 showed increasing deposition of IgG and C3 with decreased staining for ESS. The sera of rats sacrificed on days 1-3 had no detectable anti-ESS antibodies; whereas animals from day 4 on had low levels of anti-ESS antibodies as determined by microcomplement fixation. Control animals showed no staining for ESS, IgG, C3 as well as no detectable anti-ESS antibodies.\r"

Mean platelet survival time was computed from the disappearance of radioactivity from blood, sampled serially after injection of autologous 51Cr-labelled platelets. C1q solid phase ELISA and conglutinin (K) solid phase ELISA were used to measure the serum levels of immune complexes. The platelet survival time in APSGN patients was 113 +/- 10 h vs 197 +/- 10 h in the control group (p less than 0.001); 68% of the patients had a shortened platelet survival, lower than 95% confidence limit. There was a significant increase in the platelet survival in the six patients that were studied after recovery from acute nephritic syndrome. There was no significant association between the mean platelet times survival and CICs (circulating immune complexes). Similarly, no significant correlation was found between the mean platelet lifespan and the severity of the glomerular disease, as assessed by the serum creatinine level and the proteinuria. These results support evidence of platelet activation and consumption in APSGN and we suggest that this activation occurs in the glomeruli capillary wall, due to platelet-vascular wall interaction.\r"

Renal biopsies showed lesions consistent with the diagnosis of the arterial form of thrombotic microangiopathy: vascular thrombosis with extensive glomerular ischemia. Renal failure persisted after withdrawal of CsA: one patient is in chronic renal failure (CRF) with a 4-year follow-up; the other died after refusal of chronic hemodialysis. In our two patients, excessive doses of CsA with high trough levels are likely to have contributed to the development of HUS. A rapid adjustment of CsA doses and an early detection of signs of the microangiopathic process might have prevented this severe complication of CsA treatment.\r"

Relevant data were obtained in twelve patients. Two patients did not have serum hypoosmolality. In the ten patients with serum hypoosmolality, urine osmolality was not maximally dilute and urine sodium concentration was greater than 30 mmol/l (30 mEq/l) suggesting inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). However, three patients exhibited suppressed ADH levels despite absence of maximal urinary dilution. The data suggest that hyponatremia is common in ICU patients and that renal diluting defects are frequent. Therefore, hypotonic fluid should be administered cautiously.\r"

It was administered orally to outpatients attending a clinic by an investigator unknown to the patients. Data were collected pertaining to the following target drugs: calcium supplements, phosphate binders, vitamins B and C and folic acid. HD and CAPD groups were closely matched for age and sex. Sixty percent of CAPD and 49% of HD patients were taking four or more medications. The dose of folic acid was accurately recalled by 91% and 71% of CAPD and HD patients. Indications for calcium supplements and phosphate binders were known by only 8% and 30% of CAPD patients compared to 72% and 73% of HD patients. More HD patients knew the indications for all target drugs (p less than 0.01). More CAPD than HD patients knew the expected duration of therapy (p less than 0.01). There was a trend between decreased knowledge of whether the medication was working with increasing age of CAPD patients. Most drug information was supplied by physicians, but many CAPD patients (21%) obtained information from lay sources. When given the opportunity to ask questions about their medicines, only 56% CAPD and 46% HD patients did so. The knowledge of CAPD and HD patients studied was grossly deficient in terms of indications, effectiveness, duration and action to be taken if doses were missed.\r"

  ".W": "With the purpose of studying peritoneal physiology, original biopsy methods were devised and human and rabbit peritoneal mesothelial cells cultured and characterized. It was then decided to verify whether these cells could be implanted autologously during peritoneal dialysis in cases of acute loss of mesothelial surface. Staphylococcal peritonitis was induced in 12 rabbits and after 4 days of antibiotics, 6 of them were autoimplanted with cultured mesothelial cells, previously marked in 3 cases with thymidine (H3TdR). Implanted rabbits sacrificed after 3 and 6 days showed taking of the new mesothelial cells both by direct morphological observation and by autoradiography. Four uremic CAPD patients recovering from severe peritonitis were implanted with 300 million of their own peritoneal mesothelial cells, previously cultured and frozen. Morphological signs of taking were evident by laparoscopy and from peritoneal biopsies performed 3 and 6 days after implant. The fact that such implants are possible may have interesting applications in medicine and surgery.\r"

Fourteen patients were given interferon daily for 4 wk. Interferon receptors per cell decreased to about 50% of baseline but increased to baseline by 2 wk after therapy ended. The activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase rose about fivefold during therapy, decreasing to baseline by 1 wk after the end of therapy. The seven other patients were given interferon daily for 2 wk, no interferon for 2 wk and then interferon daily for 2 wk more. During both periods of therapy on this schedule, interferon receptors decreased to about 50% but returned to baseline 1 wk after the interferon was stopped. The activity of 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase increased about fivefold during both the first and second periods of therapy and decreased to baseline 1 wk after interferon was stopped. Close negative correlation existed between the number of interferon receptors and the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase activity. The results of interferon therapy could not be predicted by either the numbers of interferon receptors before therapy or by the decrease in this number during therapy.\r"

  ".W": "In a randomized controlled trial of recombinant alpha-2a interferon for chronic hepatitis B, interferon antibodies developed in 21 (39%) of 54 Chinese adults who received IFN. No correlation was observed between sex, age, pretreatment serum ALT level or liver histological findings and the development of interferon antibodies. Antibodies were significantly more likely to develop in patients who received lower doses (2.5 or 5 MU/m2) of alpha-2a interferon than in those who received a higher dose (10 MU/m2): 53% vs. 11% (p = 0.006). The development of interferon antibodies appeared to reverse the initial antiviral response to treatment, with reappearance of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum in 12 patients and HBeAg in three patients. Sustained clearance of HBeAg was achieved in only one (5%) patient but was achieved in seven (21%) patients without interferon antibodies. The mere presence of interferon antibodies did not preclude an antiviral response to interferon therapy, but patients with high titer neutralizing antibodies were less likely to respond. These findings suggest that interferon antibodies may negate the antiviral effects of alpha-2a interferon. A higher incidence of interferon antibodies in Chinese vs. white patients with chronic hepatitis B may contribute to the poorer antiviral response in Chinese patients.\r"

Anti-pre-S antibodies were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on the inhibition of binding of monoclonal antibodies to epitopes in the pre-S1 and pre-S2 sequence. In acute, self-limited infection, anti-pre-S antibodies appeared in a biphasic pattern. The early antibodies were detected at the time of clinical signs of acute disease when HBsAg and often HBeAg were present, but hepatitis B virus DNA was no longer detectable in serum. Anti-pre-S levels then fell, but subsequently reappeared as the late antibody during the recovery phase, after development of anti-HBe, but before anti-HBs. Anti-pre-S responses were detected in 15 of 17 patients who recovered (88.2%) and in both patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection evolving to chronic liver disease. Although the early antibodies to pre-S1 and pre-S2 proteins appeared at the time of decreasing levels of infectious virus in serum in cases of self-limited infection, these antibodies also were transiently or continuously present with high levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients in whom chronic hepatitis B infection developed. Thus the anti-pre-S response in acute hepatitis is not a prognostic marker for clinical resolution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Sera were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive results confirmed by immunoblot. Purified recombinant MS2 Pol-HBx fusion protein was used as target for both assays. Among serial sera of patients with nonfulminant acute hepatitis, 24 of 64 patients (37.5%) were positive for anti-HBx. In fulminant cases, 15 of 36 patients (42%) had anti-HBx. In chronic hepatitis patients with high rates of hepatitis B virus replication, we found a significantly (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of anti-HBx, 14 of 25 patients (56%), than in those with low replication, 14 of 66 patients (21%), or among asymptomatic HBsAg carrier blood donors (20 of 126 = 16%) without detectable hepatitis B virus replication (p less than 0.0001). The highest prevalence of anti-HBx was found in HBsAg carriers with cirrhosis (41 of 54 patients = 76%) and/or with hepatocellular carcinoma (18 of 33 patients = 54%). The findings suggest that anti-HBx appears as a common and early marker of hepatitis B virus infection, transient in self-limited hepatitis but persisting with progression to chronicity. In chronic hepatitis, the prevalence of anti-HBx correlated with the intensity and duration of hepatitis B virus replication but neither with the severity of the liver disease nor with malignant transformation per se.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Defective clones had point mutations from guanine to adenine at nucleotide 83 in the precore region, converting codon 28 from tryptophan (TGG) to a stop codon (TAG). In contrast, this defect was not found in any of 39 hepatitis B virus DNA clones from three patients who seroconverted to antibody to HBeAg but then redeveloped HBeAg with reactivation of hepatitis. Using these results, the G-to-A point mutation at nucleotide 83 in the precore region would predict sustained positivity for antibody to HBeAg and remission of hepatitis in patients who have seroconverted either spontaneously or with interferon therapy.\r"

These patients had increased serum levels of AST and IgG, high titers of autoantibodies, no history of blood transfusion and were negative for HBsAg and antibodies to HBc. Three hundred eighty-six healthy subjects and 30 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis served as control groups. The frequency of DR4 was significantly higher in autoimmune hepatitis patients (90.3%) than in healthy subjects (38.6%) and in cryptogenic chronic hepatitis patients (30%). The frequency of Bw54 was significantly higher in autoimmune hepatitis patients (45.2%) than in healthy subjects (10.9%). The risk to DR4-positive subjects for autoimmune hepatitis was 14.8 relative to healthy subjects. Two of 31 patients (6.5%) with autoimmune hepatitis were positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus; both clearly satisfied criteria for autoimmune hepatitis and both had Bw54 and DR4. This study revealed a highly significant association of autoimmune hepatitis with human leukocyte antigen Bw54 and DR4 in Japanese patients. Among the DR4-positive patients with autoimmune hepatitis, no significant differences were seen between those positive or negative for Bw54 with regard to clinical or laboratory data, relapse of disease or efficacy of prednisolone. Thus human leukocyte antigen class II alleles contribute to susceptibility and resistance to autoimmune hepatitis in Japanese patients, with distinct racial differences from those in white patients.\r"

Biopsy specimens taken immediately after revascularization of the graft were used as controls. Patients studied include 18 with initial rejection episodes, 11 with unresolved rejection, five with vanishing bile duct syndrome and eight patients with other forms of liver injury. Quantitation was done in a blinded fashion for the first 20 biopsy specimens. A double immunolabeling technique was used to simultaneously immunolabel bile duct structures (with anti-major histocompatibility complex class II or antikeratins) and lymphoid populations (with anti-CD2, anti-CD4 or anti-CD8). This facilitated the accurate quantitation of intraepithelial lymphocytes within bile ducts. This technique also enabled simultaneous detection of CD4 and CD8 antigens on lymphocytes in portal tracts. The predominant lymphocyte subtype within biliary epithelium during acute and chronic rejection was of the CD2+/CD8+ phenotype. CD8+/CD4+ ratio in bile ducts was approximately 5:1 in acute, unresolved and chronic rejection. In vanishing bile duct syndrome, double immunolabeling enabled the detection of destroyed interlobular bile duct remnants that were not apparent on routine hematoxylin and eosin staining. Attached to some of these structures were CD8+ lymphocytes. Lobular CD8+ cells were not prominent in acute rejection but increased significantly in biopsy specimens from patients with unresolved and chronic rejection. In chronic rejection, a selective increase was seen in these CD8+ cells in centrizonal regions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this study we demonstrate that the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor is also a target antigen for T cell-mediated immune responses. Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 37% (7 of 19) of patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and 33% (2 of 6) of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis showed a proliferative response to highly purified human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor, whereas no proliferation was found with peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with chronic viral hepatitis (0 of 13) and healthy blood donors (0 of 4). Moreover, we isolated T-cell clones from liver biopsy samples of two patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and two patients with peripheral blood lymphocytes. Between 2.8% and 14.3% of these clones showed a specific proliferative response to purified human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor. The response was restricted to autologous antigen-presenting cells and could be blocked by monoclonal antibodies against human leukocyte antigen-DR molecules. The response of T cells to the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor did not require the lectinlike activity of the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Thus the human hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor could be identified as a major target antigen of humoral and cellular immune reactions in autoimmune-mediated liver diseases.\r"

At that time, glycogen content was significantly reduced, but no obvious changes in albumin, beta-actin and aldolase B mRNAs and in glutathione levels were observed. Enzymatic perfusion yielded 280 +/- 30 x 10(6) viable hepatocytes vs. 520 +/- 40 x 10(6) viable hepatocytes from unstored organs. Cell viability determined by trypan blue exclusion was 74% and 90%, respectively. Hepatocytes from University of Wisconsin-preserved livers had a 29% reduced adenosine triphosphate content, but glutathione levels did not significantly differ from those found in unstored cells. When put into culture, hepatocytes formed typical monolayers of granular epithelial cells and did not exhibit alteration of their fine structure when compared with cells from unstored organs. After 24 and 48 hr, they showed variations in cytochrome P-450 content and ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity similar to those observed with unstored cells. By contrast, overall protein synthesis and albumin secretion rate were 40% and 30% lower, respectively. Hepatocytes from University of Wisconsin-preserved organs could be cryopreserved and further cultured as unstored cells. The University of Wisconsin solution was also used to preserve isolated hepatocytes. Viability of freshly isolated hepatocytes was decreased by only 10% after 48 hr of hypothermic liver storage when assayed by intracellular lactate dehydrogenase content. However, after 4 hr of storage, in contrast with hepatocytes preserved in L15 Leibovitz medium, the cells attached poorly to plastic and exhibited morphological alterations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Since synthesis of antiproteases is markedly increased during acute inflammatory reaction, the aim of this work was to investigate the toxicity of neutrophils against normal vs. inflammatory rat hepatocytes. Acute inflammatory reaction was induced by subcutaneous injection of turpentine 24 hr before the experiments. Hepatocytes from normal and turpentine-treated rats were isolated by collagenase digestion. They were incubated with human neutrophils stimulated by 1 mg/ml opsonized zymosan. Cytotoxicity was quantified by the percentage of alanine aminotransferase activity released by hepatocytes in culture medium after an 18-hr incubation period. By comparison to normal hepatocytes, inflammatory hepatocytes were more resistant to the toxicity of neutrophils. At a neutrophil/hepatocyte ratio of 20:1, the alanine aminotransferase activity releases were 53.7% +/- 5.4% (mean +/- 1 S.E.) and 27.4% +/- 4.8% for normal and inflammatory hepatocytes, respectively. Similarly, inflammatory hepatocytes were found to be less sensitive than normal hepatocytes to the toxic effect of purified neutrophil cathepsin G. In contrast, both types of hepatocytes exhibited the same sensitivity to H2O2 generated by a system consisting of glucose and glucose oxidase. Two arguments suggested that the resistance of inflammatory hepatocytes to protease toxicity was explained by an increased production of antiproteases by these cells: (a) when tested against cathepsin G and porcine pancreatic elastase activities, the protease inhibitory capacity of conditioned medium from inflammatory hepatocytes was higher than that of conditioned medium from normal hepatocytes; (b) conditioned medium from inflammatory hepatocytes markedly reduced the toxicity of stimulated neutrophils as that of cathepsin G.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have previously shown that transplanted isolated encapsulated hepatocytes can provide sufficient short-term metabolic support to improve the survival of animals with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure. Here we have demonstrated the feasibility of isolated encapsulated hepatocyte transplantation in providing long-term metabolic liver support in Gunn rats. Gunn rats have a congenital inability to conjugate bilirubin and thus exhibit lifelong hyperbilirubinemia. We studied the feasibility of isolated encapsulated hepatocyte transplantation in restoring this specific liver function. Free hepatocytes, isolated from male Wistar rats, were microencapsulated with collagen within a trilayered sodium alginate-poly-L-lysine-sodium alginate membrane using techniques developed in our laboratory. A total of 45 Gunn rats underwent intraperitoneal transplantation with free hepatocytes (5 x 10(7], isolated encapsulated hepatocytes (5 x 10(7], control (empty) microcapsules or no transplant (untreated controls). Serum bilirubin levels were monitored daily for 10 days after transplantation, and subsequent weekly samples were obtained for up to 1 mo. Microcapsules were studied by light and electron microscopy 1 mo after transplantation. During the first week after transplantation, the mean maximum reduction in serum bilirubin levels for the isolated encapsulated hepatocytes, free hepatocytes and control microcapsule transplanted groups was 45.7%, 18.6% and 14.3%, respectively. For up to 1 mo thereafter the mean reduction in serum bilirubin levels in these respective groups was 34.8%, 13.5% and 3.3%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine the effect of liver transplantation on the respiratory and cardiovascular functions, ventilation/perfusion relationships were determined by multiple inert gas elimination technique in six patients with end-stage liver disease 1 to 19 mo before and 2 to 6 mo after liver transplantation. Cardiac output and pulmonary vascular pressures were measured after catheterization of the pulmonary artery. All patients had normal spirometry and chest x-ray films before transplantation. PaO2 before transplantation was 78.8 +/- 7.4 mm Hg (range = 51.8 to 102.8 mm Hg). All patients had perfusion of poorly ventilated lung regions (low ventilation/perfusion relationships) varying from 3% to 19% of cardiac output (mean = 8.5% +/- 2.4% of cardiac output) and two patients had intrapulmonary shunting (3% and 20% of cardiac output). Measured and calculated PaO2 agreed closely, indicating absence of pulmonary diffusion abnormality, as well as of extrapulmonary shunting. After transplantation, PaO2 normalized in all patients, and both shunting and low ventilation/perfusion relationships disappeared. Cardiac output decreased from 9.1 +/- 1.4 to 6.6 +/- 0.5 L/min (p less than 0.05), and the pulmonary vascular resistance increased from 0.69 +/- 0.14 to 1.64 +/- 0.43 mm Hg/L/min (p less than 0.05). The systemic vascular resistance also increased (before = 8.7 +/- 1.0; after = 15.3 +/- 1.1 mm Hg/L/min; p less than 0.001). Normalization of respiratory and cardiovascular alterations, after liver transplantation, in patients with end-stage liver disease indicates that these changes have a direct functional relationship to the diseased liver. It is hypothesized that this is part of a \"hepatopulmonary syndrome,' which in similarity to the hepatorenal syndrome disappears with improved liver function.\r"

Treatment of rats with continuous systemic or regional infusion of recombinant human interleukin-2 with a dose of 4 to 8 x 10(4) U/day during 7 days, resulted in an increase in number of large granular lymphocytes or pit cells in the liver up to 43 times normal. Kupffer cells, nongranular lymphocytes, monocytes and neutrophils also increased in number, but with a maximal fivefold increase this was much less pronounced than for large granular lymphocytes. Kupffer cells showed morphological signs of activation and were frequently seen in mitosis. Frequent mitoses were also observed for large granular lymphocytes, but not for other leukocytes. This indicates that the effect of interleukin-2 treatment on hepatic (sinusoidal) cells was primarily directed to large granular lymphocytes and Kupffer cells. The large granular lymphocyte accumulation occurred mainly intrasinusoidally, but they were also frequently observed in the space of Disse where they are not found in control rats. This may be explained partly by the observed damage or gaps in the endothelial lining. The intrasinusoidal large granular lymphocytes adhered to the endothelium and to Kupffer cells. Higher responses, for all cell types, were found when interleukin-2 was administered regionally, that is, through the hepatic artery rather than through the systemic route (jugular vein), although the differences were not statistically significant. Doses below 4 x 10(4) U/day did not result in significant increases of large granular lymphocytes in the liver.\r"

  ".W": "Progressive liver fibrosis in rats develops when they are fed a diet deficient in choline. This diet also results in a pronounced and selective decrease in the liver microsomal content of a phase I drug-metabolizing enzyme belonging to the cytochrome P-450III gene family. Because P-450III cytochromes characteristically catalyze the N-demethylation of erythromycin, we believed that the production of breath CO2 from erythromycin would be dramatically reduced in choline-deficient rats. However, when 12 choline-deficient rats were compared with 9 control rats, the reduction in CO2 production from erythromycin (mean decrease 71%) was essentially identical to that from aminopyrine (mean decrease 69%), a substrate believed to be metabolized normally by the hepatocyte in fibrotic liver disease. Furthermore, we found that the relative erythromycin and aminopyrine demethylase activities were comparable when measured in vitro in liver microsomes prepared from the choline-deficient rats. To determine the molecular basis for the erythromycin demethylase activity in the choline-deficient rats, the liver microsomes were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a variety of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies capable of distinguishing individual P-450III-related proteins. Our studies confirm that a major erythromycin demethylase belonging to the P-450III family, termed P-450p, was greatly reduced in the choline-deficient rat liver. However, the specific concentration of a second P-450p-related protein was essentially normal and that of a third P-450p-related protein was actually increased in the choline-deficient rat liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91078776\r", 
  ".W": "Studies were conducted to evaluate the possible induction or the maintenance of cytochrome P-450IIE1 in primary hepatocyte cultures by the inducing agent 4-methylpyrazole. Hepatocytes were isolated from control (noninduced) rats and from rats treated in vivo with either pyrazole or 4-methylpyrazole to induce P-450IIE1. The content of P-450IIE1 was determined by Western blots with antipyrazole P-450 IgG, and catalytic activity was assessed by assays of dimethylnitrosamine demethylase activity. The treatment with 4-methylpyrazole in vivo increased the content of P-450IIE1 and dimethylnitrosamine demethylase activity sevenfold and fourfold, respectively. In cultures prepared from noninduced hepatocytes, P-450IIE1 levels fell to values of 76%, 65%, 31% and 1% of freshly isolated hepatocytes after 1, 3, 6 and 9 days in culture. A similar decrease in dimethylnitrosamine demethylase was observed during this time. In cultures prepared from induced hepatocytes, the decline in P-450IIE1 was more rapid as levels fell to 77%, 31%, 3% and 3% of initial values after 1, 3, 6 and 9 days in culture. Again, the fall in dimethylnitrosamine demethylase activity paralleled the decline in content of P-450IIE1 and was more rapid with the induced hepatocytes. With cultures prepared from noninduced or induced hepatocytes, the addition of 4-methylpyrazole in vitro did not increase the content of P-450IIE1 or the activity of dimethylnitrosamine demethylase over the initial values. However, 4-methylpyrazole appeared to stabilize the P-450IIE1 and to decrease its rate of decline in culture. In noninduced cultures, the percent remaining content of P-450IIE1 after 6 days was 31% in the absence of and 52% in the presence of 5 mol/L 4-methylpyrazole. In cultures from 4-methylpyrazole-induced hepatocytes, the percent remaining P-450IIE1 after 3 days was 31% in the absence of inducer and 59% with 4-methylpyrazole added in vitro. Similarly 4-methylpyrazole helped to prevent the rapid decline of dimethylnitrosamine demethylase activity in induced and noninduced cultures. Viability of the induced and noninduced cultures in the absence or presence of added 4-methylpyrazole was similar. Levels of mRNA for P-450IIE1 were similar for livers from control rats and from rats treated in vivo with 4-methylpyrazole. The mRNA levels rapidly declined in induced and noninduced cultures, and this decline, unlike the fall in P-450IIE1 or dimethylnitrosamine demethylase activity, could not be prevented by the addition of 4-methylpyrazole in vitro to the cultures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Characteristic features of alcoholic liver injury include fibrosis and striking membrane alterations, with associated phospholipid changes. To offset some of these abnormalities, a 10-yr study was conducted in baboons: 12 animals (eight females, four males) were fed a liquid diet supplemented with polyunsaturated lecithin (4.1 mg/kcal) for up to 8 yr, with either ethanol (50% of total energy) or isocaloric carbohydrate. They were compared with another group of 18 baboons fed an equivalent amount of the same diet (with or without ethanol), but devoid of lecithin. In the two groups, comparable increases in lipids developed in the ethanol-fed animals, but striking differences in the degree of fibrosis were seen. Whereas at least septal fibrosis (with cirrhosis in two) and transformation of their lipocytes into transitional cells developed in seven of the nine baboons fed the regular diet with ethanol, septal fibrosis did not develop in any animals fed lecithin (p less than 0.005). They did not progress beyond the stage of perivenular fibrosis (sometimes associated with pericellular and perisinusoidal fibrosis) and had a significantly lesser activation of lipocytes to transitional cells. Furthermore, when three of these animals were taken off lecithin, but continued on the same amount of the ethanol-containing diet, they rapidly (within 18 to 21 mo) progressed to cirrhosis, accompanied by an increased transformation of their lipocytes to transitional cells. These results indicate that some component of lecithin exerts a protective action against the fibrogenic effects of ethanol. Because we had previously found that choline, in amounts present in lecithin, has no comparable action, the polyunsaturated phospholipids themselves might be responsible for the protective effect.\r"

At 4, 24 and 78 wk liver nonheme iron concentrations were 67-, 42- and 21-fold higher than controls, respectively. Much of the iron was in macrophages, but hepatocytes were also strongly positive for Perls' stainable iron. One feature was the development of iron-positive nuclear inclusions in hepatocytes. After a delay of at least 8 wk when no stainable iron was evident, a maximum of 37% of periportal hepatocytes contained inclusions by 24 wk. Although this proportion remained constant for the remainder of the study, the size of the inclusions (which were not membrane-limited) increased to greater than 3 microns in diameter, occupying greater than 25% of the nuclear volume. The presence of iron in the inclusions was confirmed by energy dispersive x-ray microanalysis. Immunocytochemical studies showed that the iron was present as aggregates of ferritin. Quantitation of nonaggregated ferritin molecules by image analyses after electron microscopy demonstrated that within 4 wk ferritin levels in cytoplasm and nucleoplasm had greatly increased but that there was a concentration gradient of approximately one order of magnitude across the nuclear envelope. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in iron-loaded mouse hepatocytes there is a slow passage of ferritin-molecules through the nuclear pores; the gradient is maintained by the continual aggregation of ferritin within the nucleus. Intranuclear ferritin may provide a source of iron for catalyzing hydroxyl radical formation in nuclei during some toxic, carcinogenic and aging processes.\r"

Earlier studies showed these effects to be independent of other opiate effects such as bile duct spasm, hypothermia or blood gas changes resulting from respiratory depression. Because opiate receptors are distributed throughout the body, within the central nervous system and at peripheral sites including the gastrointestinal tract, experiments were performed to ascertain whether central or peripheral sites mediate the hepatobiliary effects of morphine. Sulfobromophthalein was administered intravenously to mice and its levels were measured in plasma and liver. Tail-flick latency indicated centrally mediated analgesia. Inhibited intestinal transit of India ink reflected an opiate effect with a significant peripheral component. When injected into a cerebral ventricle morphine was much more potent in producing analgesia and raising sulfobromophthalein levels than when administered intravenously or intraperitoneally. An intravenous dose of naloxone that reversed morphine analgesia also prevented sulfobromophthalein elevation but did not prevent gut slowing. Naltrexone injected in a cerebral ventricle also reversed analgesia and sulfobromophthalein elevation but not intestinal slowing. The polar opiate agonist N-methylmorphine did not cause analgesia or raise sulfobromophthalein levels at peripheral intraperitoneal doses to 100 mg/kg. When given in a central ventricle at 4 x 10(-3) mg/kg, this agent produced analgesia and raised sulfobromophthalein but did not slow intestinal transit. After spinal cord transection, intravenous morphine did not retard the tail-flick response or affect sulfobromophthalein disposition, but peripherally mediated intestinal transit was slowed as it was in intact mice. These experiments demonstrate parallel opiate effects on analgesia and on BSP disposition but not on intestinal transit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were seen at 3-mo intervals for 2 yr. On entry to the trial the three groups were comparable in terms of clinical and biological parameters, including size of esophageal varices (grade I = 51, grade II = 54, grade III = 17), Child-Pugh classification (A = 29, B = 61, C = 32) and the origin of cirrhosis (alcoholic in 79% of cases). Twenty-four patients bled (two bled in the propranolol group, nine bled in the endoscopic sclerosis of esophageal varices group and 13 bled in the placebo group). Actuarial estimates (Kaplan-Meier) of the time of onset of first bleeding showed that the differences were significant between propranolol and placebo (p less than 0.004) and between propranolol and sclerotherapy (p less than 0.03) but not between sclerotherapy and placebo.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Mature human B lymphocytes perform many functions including antibody secretion, Ag presentation, preservation of memory for Ag, and lymphokine secretion. Individual resting B cells receive multiple sequential signals that determine the function(s) that will be performed by those cells. Activation signals such as Ag or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (Sac) stimulate overlapping but different subpopulations of B cells. After activation, B cells may be induced to proliferate by a variety of B cell growth factors (BCGF) including IL-2, IL-4, TNF-alpha, low molecular weight BCGF (LMW-BCGF), and high molecular weight BCGF (HMW-BCGF). Little information exists to explain why so many different BCGFs are involved with human B cell proliferation. The current studies were designed to examine the role HMW-BCGF plays in selecting B cells for particular functions. HMW-BCGF but not LMW-BCGF was found to inhibit Ig secretion when it was included in culture with Sac-activated B cells and B cell differentiation factors (BCDFs) including IL-6. Sorting resting B lymphocytes into surface IgD+ and IgD- populations and then stimulating each population with anti-mu revealed that the cells most responsive to HMW-BCGF resided in the surface IgD- sorted population. Sorting activated B lymphocytes into BA5 (HMW-BCGFR)+ and BA5- populations revealed that BA5+ B cells stimulated with BCDF (in the absence of HMW-BCGF) produced predominantly IgG, whereas the BA5- population produced both IgG and IgM. Finally, expansion of peripheral B cells from tetanus toxoid-immunized donors with either HMW-BCGF or LMW-BCGF revealed that the HMW-BCGF-expanded population produced predominantly IgG tetanus-specific antibody in the presence of BCDF (in the absence of HMW-BCGF), whereas the LMW-BCGF-expanded population produced IgM much greater than IgG tetanus-specific antibody. Thus, HMW-BCGF may function to expand a subpopulation of B cells for memory B cell functions.\r"

This activity is expressed by Th of both Th1 and Th2 subtypes, as well as a third Th clone that is not classified into either subtype. It is proposed that anti-CD3 activation of Th results in the expression of Th membrane proteins that trigger B cell cycle entry. Kinetic studies reveal that 4 to 8 h of activation with anti-CD3 is sufficient for ThCD3 to express B cell-activating function. However, activation of Th with anti-CD3 for extended periods of time results in reduced Th effector activity. Inhibition of Th RNA synthesis during the anti-CD3 activation period ablates the ability of ThCD3 to induce B cell cycle entry. This indicates that de novo synthesis of proteins is required for ThCD3 to express effector function. The ability of fixed ThCD3 to induce entry of B cell into cycle is not due to an increase in expression of CD3, CD4, LFA-1, ICAM-1, class I MHC or Thy-1. Other forms of Th activation (PMA and A23187, Con A) also induced Th effector function. Furthermore, purified plasma membranes from anti-CD3 activated, but not resting Th, induced resting B cells to enter cycle. The addition of IL-4, but not IL-2, IL-5, or IFN-gamma amplified the DNA synthetic response of B cells stimulated with PM from activated Th. Taken together these data indicate that de novo expression of Th surface proteins on activated Th is required for Th to induce B cell cycle entry into G1 and the addition of IL-4 is required for the heightened progression into S phase.\r"

  ".W": "In this paper, we examined in detail the ability of anti-1F7 to modulate 1F7 (CD26) surface expression as well as analyzed the functional relationship between the surface expression of CD3, CD2, and CD26 and human T cell activation. We showed that anti-1F7-induced modulation is an energy-dependent process that occurs via capping and internalization of the Ag-antibody complex. Although the recovery rate for Ag reexpression of 1F7 following optimal modulation is relatively delayed, reexpression of 1F7 is greatly accelerated following phorbol ester treatment. Most importantly, we demonstrated that modulation of the CD26 Ag leads to an enhancement in the proliferative activity of modulated human T cells treated with anti-CD3 or anti-CD2, which is preceded by an enhancement in Ca2+ mobilization. CD26 modulation also led to an increase in anti-CD3- or anti-CD2-mediated T cell clone proliferation. Finally, whereas modulation of the CD26 Ag has an effect on CD3- or CD2-induced T cell activation, modulation of the CD3/TCR complex inhibits the proliferative response of T cells incubated with anti-CD3 plus anti-1F7 or anti-CD2 plus anti-1F7. However, modulation of the CD2 structure does not affect anti-CD3- plus anti-1F7-induced human T cell activation. The above results thus provide additional evidence that the CD26 Ag plays an integral role in the regulation of human T cell activation.\r"

Fluoresceinated hFPB binds specifically to hFPB-responsive T cells, but not to unrelated T hybrids. Among variant subclones of the original hybridoma, ability to bind hFPB correlates with hFPB-specific response and expression of the CD3/TCR complex, indicating that hFPB is binding to the TCR. This TCR-hFPB interaction has an affinity of approximately 6.6 microM, reflecting slow association and rapid dissociation of the Ag from its receptor. These findings confirm the potential for direct Ag-TCR interaction and indicate an Ag recognition mechanism that is not initiated by Ag-MHC interaction.\r"

Experiments using mutated I-Ak molecules indicate that the ability of a mutant Ia species to present Ag is distinct from its ability to stabilize the Ag-recognition complex, suggesting that T cell stimulation depends not only upon stabilization of Ag-TCR-Ia complexes, but also upon distinct Ia-influenced conformational signals.\r"

One type had characteristics of conventional class II-restricted Th cells. These CD4+ CD8- I-Ab-restricted T cells recognized a self determinant, present within the insulin B-chain. This determinant was distinct from the immunodominant A-chain loop determinant that is recognized by the majority of T cells induced after immunization with normally immunogenic beef insulin. Our results suggest that this determinant is readily generated during immunologic processing of insulins, including nonimmunogenic pork insulin and self insulin. A second type of T cell lacking CD4 and CD8 recognized a distinct B-chain determinant of insulin in a class II-dependent, but MHC unrestricted, fashion. These cells may represent a novel subpopulation which has bypassed conventional selection during development in the thymus.\r"

Following negative selection using adherence and antibody and complement depletion, highly purified T cells were examined to determine their ability to undergo activation. Three weeks after GvHR initiation, unstimulated splenic T cells from GvHR mice displayed normal CD3 and IL-2R expression but elevated expression of class I MHC and Ly-6A/E antigens. Despite culture with normal F1 accessory cells, both CD4+ and CD8+ GvHR T cells exhibited low levels of proliferation to both Con A and anti-CD3 mAb. Although following exposure for 12 h to either of these stimuli, GvHR T cells expressed normal levels of IL-2R, expression was greatly decreased vs normal T cells between 24 and 48 h. In addition, at no timepoint was detectable IL-2 produced by GvHR T cells. Importantly, mixing experiments did not demonstrate detectable suppressive activity in the purified GvHR T cell subsets. GvHR T cells were also tested for their ability to respond to stimuli in the absence of any accessory cell population. These cells again did not proliferate to levels equivalent to normal T cells. Incubation with PMA and either cytokines (Con A supernatant, rIL-7) or anti-CD3 mAb resulted in only low levels of proliferation in GvHR T cells. Notably, at high ionomycin concentrations together with PMA, GvHR T cells did proliferate to equivalent levels as normal cells. However, with decreasing concentrations of ionophore, these cells failed to proliferate as well as normal cells. In total, these findings demonstrate that GvHR T cells are phenotypically and functionally distinct from normal T cells. The results suggest that GvHR T cells themselves may contribute to the well-characterized immune depression occurring in recipients undergoing GvHR.\r"

Approximately fourfold higher doses of soluble competitor are required than of competitor in CFA-depot, in order to achieve comparable levels of inhibition. The inhibition of priming to a nonimmunodominant T cell determinant requires lower doses of soluble competitor than the suppression of priming to a dominant T cell determinant.

TNC-R3.1 cell, which has the similar properties to thymic nurse cells, formed a unique complex with normal thymocyte subpopulations. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CD4+8+ and CD4-8- immature thymocytes preferentially interacted with TNC-R3.1 stromal cell clone. CD4+8+ thymocytes, which interacted with TNC-R3.1 stromal cell clone, contained a higher proportion of large size and cycling T cells than did noninteracting CD4+8+ thymocytes. As is generally accepted, CD4+8+ thymocytes did not respond to any stimulation such as IL-2, anti-CD3 mAb (2C11), or IL-2 plus 2C11. However, culture of isolated CD4+8+ thymocytes on TNC-R3.1 stromal cell monolayer in the presence of suboptimal dose of IL-2 induced a significant cell growth. Moreover, the addition of 2C11 and IL-2 into this coculture system resulted in a dramatic increase of the proliferative response of thymocytes. Flow cytometry analysis showed the proliferating cells on TNC-R3.1, which originated from CD4+8+ thymocytes, were mostly TCR-alpha beta+ CD3+CD4-8+ T cells. These results provide in vitro evidence that CD4+8+ thymocytes are at an intermediate stage of T cell maturation and TNC-R3.1 stromal cell clone induces the growth and differentiation of CD4+8+ thymocytes into CD4-8+ T cells.\r"

As part of this process, Ag recognition by TCR generates a series of second signals including protein kinase C, tyrosine kinase, and Ca2+ mobilization. To investigate the role of these second messengers in class II MHC expression, purified T cells were first stimulated by PMA, ionomycin, OKT3 accompanied by IL-2, or the mitogenic anti-CD2 antibodies T112 and T113 and were then stained with FITC-conjugated anti-class I and -class II MHC antibodies for analysis by flow cytometry. OKT3 and IL-2 induced optimal expression of HLA-DR (DR) on 70% of T cells with high density. Despite their high mitogenicity, induction of class II MHC expression by PMA, even with co-stimulation by ionomycin, was reduced to less than 20% of T cells, with an intensity 50-fold lower than in OKT3/IL-2-stimulated T cells. Furthermore, PMA inhibited class II MHC expression by OKT3/IL-2-stimulated T cells in a dose-dependent manner and additional stimuli, such as IL-1, IL-4, IFN-gamma, TCR cross-linkers, or monocytes, did not restore class II MHC expression by PMA-activated T cells. DR beta mRNA analysis showed that the low induction of class II molecules by PMA extends to the transcriptional level. Interestingly, anti-T112 and anti-T113 induced not only proliferation of T cells but also DR expression on more than 90% of T cells. These results indicate that transduction of a specific signal, probably selective phosphorylation of the CD3 molecule, contributes to class II MHC induction in the process of T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Both cellular activation signals and exposure to glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (Dex) cause programmed cell death in T cell hybridomas. When cells were activated in the presence of Dex, however, the degree of killing that was achieved by either stimulus alone was markedly reduced. Dex-induced programmed cell death of normal T cell clones was also prevented by cellular activation. Cyclosporin A (CsA) completely blocked the activation-induced death of T cell hybridomas, but actually enhanced the killing caused by Dex. The addition of CsA to activated T cell hybridomas in the presence of Dex allowed killing to proceed, consistent with ability of CsA to block activation-induced nuclear gene transcription. A number of independent approaches were used to explore the effect of activation on the glucocorticoid signaling/effector pathway. First, RU-486, which binds the glucocorticoid receptor and is a potent competitive antagonist of Dex, did not inhibit activation-induced cell killing. Second, activation of T cell hybridomas did not cause the translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, nor did it prevent the receptor translocation induced by treatment with Dex. Finally, T cell hybridomas were transfected with a plasmid containing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of two tandemly arranged glucocorticoid-responsive elements. Activation of these cells did not induce CAT activity, and did not inhibit the CAT activity induced by Dex. In fact, there was a paradoxical increase in CAT activity when cells were treated with both stimuli. We conclude that cellular activation does not directly utilize the glucocorticoid receptor nor the glucocorticoid pathway when inducing programmed cell death. Furthermore, the ability of activation to inhibit Dex-mediated killing is not due to interference with the classical glucocorticoid signaling pathway, up to and including the initiation of gene transcription. Alternative mechanisms of antagonism, as well as the possible relevance of this phenomenon to the positive selection of self-recognizing thymocytes, are discussed.\r"

However, 1,25(OH)2D3 has no inhibitory effect on CD23 production by either resting or activated tonsillar B cells.

By using the luminescence sandwich-ELISA, low but measurable levels of IL-6 (9.5 pg/ml on average) were found in the sera from normal individuals. The serum levels of IL-6 were elevated in HIV-seropositive asymptomatic carriers (55.5 pg/ml on average), and the IL-6 levels were correlated with the degree of HIV-induced disease progression (AIDS-related complex 106.8 pg/ml on average and (AIDS 283 pg/ml). IL-6 immunoreactivity in the sera of AIDS patients eluted at a 25,000 m.w. major peak, which was biologically active and heat-stable, and a 500,000 m.w. minor peak in size-exclusion HPLC. Interestingly, a significant correlation was observed between the serum IL-6 levels and soluble IL-2R levels. In vitro, HIV infection of PHA-activated PBMC led to enhanced release of IL-6 into the culture supernatants. Moreover, soluble IL-2R release was markedly increased by adding exogenous IL-6, whereas it was decreased by adding the neutralizing anti-IL-6 mAb to the cultures. These results demonstrate that increased IL-6 levels are significantly associated with sIL-2R levels, and suggest a cause of the increased levels of this receptor in patients with HIV infection. Furthermore, both serum IL-6 and serum IL-2R levels in HIV infection reflect the stage of the HIV-induced disease.\r"

  ".W": "Cytotoxic effector cells like cytotoxic T cells, NK cells, monocytes/macrophages, and neutrophils can lyse directly HIV-infected or HIV-coated cells in the absence or presence of anti-HIV antibodies. Therefore, these cytotoxic mechanisms can be invoked either in the control of HIV infection at early stages of the disease or in the generalized immunosuppression observed at later stages of the disease. The relationship between anti-HIV effector mechanisms and disease, however, remains elusive. The present study investigates in HIV+ seropositive asymptomatic patients peripheral blood monocytes (PBM)-mediated antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against HIV-coated target cells in the presence of heterologous or autologous anti-HIV serum. To test for specific ADCC against HIV Ag, a T4+ CEM.TR line resistant to TNF and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity was selected in vitro. ADCC was performed in an 18-h 51Cr-release assay using CEM.TR cells coated with inactivated HIV. Unlike PBM from normal controls, significant ADCC was observed by PBM from HIV+ seropositive patients in the presence of pooled HIV+ antiserum. The ADCC activity was specific for HIV and was dependent on the E:T ratio and the antiserum dilution used. Upon activation of PBM with rIFN-gamma, both normal and HIV+ PBM-mediated ADCC against HIV-coated CEM.TR. Furthermore, ADCC activity by PBM from HIV+ seropositive patients in the presence of their autologous serum was examined. Significant ADCC activity was observed and was dependent on the E:T ratio and serum dilution used. The findings demonstrating anti-HIV ADCC activity by PBM from HIV+ seropositive individuals and their autologous sera support the notion that monocyte-mediated ADCC may be operative in vivo.\r"

  ".W": "Peptide fragments of the CD4 molecule were compared in their ability to 1) inhibit CD4-dependent HIV-induced cell fusion; 2) inhibit CD4-dependent HIV infection in vitro; and 3) block gp120 envelope glycoprotein binding to CD4. Peptides from the region CD4(81-92), although inactive when underivatized, were equipotent inhibitors of CD4-dependent virus infection, cell fusion, and CD4/gp120 binding when derivatized via benzylation and acetylation. Peptides of identical chemical composition, but altered sequence and derivatization pattern that blocked gp120 binding to either CD4-positive cells or solubilized CD4, also blocked infection and fusion with similar potencies. Those that did not block gp120/CD4 interaction were also inactive in HIV-1 infection and cell fusion assays. No other peptide fragments of the CD4 molecule inhibited fusion, infection, or CD4/gp120 interaction. The peptide CD4(23-56), derived from a region of CD4 implicated in binding of CD4 antibodies that neutralize HIV infection and cell fusion, had no effect on CD4-dependent cell fusion, HIV-1 infection, or CD4/gp120 binding, but did reverse OKT4A and anti-Leu 3a blockade of gp120 binding to CD4. These data provide evidence that the 81-92 region of CD4 is directly involved in gp120 binding leading to CD4-dependent HIV infection and syncytium formation. Previous observations with structural mutants of CD4 suggest that the CDR2-homologous region of CD4 is also involved, either directly or indirectly, in binding of gp120 to CD4. The CDR2- and CDR3-like domains of CD4 may both contribute to the binding of the HIV envelope necessary for HIV-1 infection and HIV-1-induced cell fusion.\r"

Despite the potential of responding to numerous individual minor histocompatibility (H) Ag on BALB.B APC, the focus of the CTL response is largely specific for only a limited number of target Ag. These minor H Ag could be distinguished by their differential expression on a panel of target cells from the CXB recombinant inbred strains, the E, G, I, J, and K (all H-2b), which express different composites of the original BALB minor H Ag. A hierarchy was observed in which first-order immunodominant Ag were present on both CXBK and CXBG cells, whereas second-order dominant Ag were found on CXBE, CXBJ, and CXBI cells. To test whether immunodominance also plays a role in the development of lethal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) directed to multiple minor H Ag, B6 T cells were transplanted along with T cell depleted bone marrow, to irradiated (825 rad) recipients of either the BALB.B or CXB recombinant inbred strains. The results indicate that a hierarchy of immunodominance does exist in GVHD, but it differs from that predicted from the in vitro CTL studies. GVHD was observed in BALB.B, CXBE, CXBI, and CXBJ recipients, but not in CXBG and CXBK recipients. Presensitization of B6 donor mice to CXBG or CXBK splenocytes 3 wk before transplant did not significantly increase the overall GVHD potential in the corresponding CXBG or CXBK recipients. Evidence for second-order immunodominance was provided by the transfer of CXBE T cells and ATBM to irradiated CXBG and BALB.B recipients with resultant, potent GVHD.\r"

Two mAb (IIIA2 and IIIB8) reacted with epitopes located within amino acid residues 1-12 of type 1 M protein. These antibodies opsonized type 1 streptococci and did not cross-react with human kidney and heart tissue. Another mAb (IC7) reacted with mesangial cells of renal glomeruli and human myocardium. The cross-reactive epitope of mAb IC7 was localized to position 13-19, indicating that it is not the same epitope as the previously described vimentin-cross-reactive epitope at position 23-26 of type 1 M protein. In Western blots of mesangial cell and myocardial proteins, mAb IC7 cross-reacted with a 43-kDa protein. Neither vimentin nor actin inhibited the binding of mAb IC7 to the cross-reactive protein, as determined by Western blot or immunofluorescence inhibition tests. These results provide evidence that type 1 M protein contains at least one autoimmune epitope shared with both human glomeruli and myocardium.\r"

This disease parallels coxsackievirus B3-induced autoimmune myocarditis in many respects and is associated with high-titer autoantibodies specific for cardiac myosin. The following lines of evidence suggest that these autoantibodies are not involved in the induction of autoimmune myocarditis: 1) immunoperoxidase staining of heart sections from cardiac myosin-immunized A/J and A.SW mice revealed IgG depositions only along damaged muscle fibres in infiltrated areas, but not in intact tissue; 2) myosin autoantibodies did not bind to the surface of viable cardiac myocytes isolated from mice, but only reacted with myocytes permeabilized with detergent; 3) mice treated with a single high dose of cyclophosphamide, which reduces the humoral immune response, still developed severe myocarditis, despite the fact that their autoantibody titers were reduced to the level of adjuvant-injected controls; and 4) passive transfer of high-titer myosin autoantibodies failed to induce myocarditis, although the titers in the recipients were comparable to those found in mice with cardiac myosin-induced disease. Together, the results suggest that high-titer myosin autoantibodies are secondary rather than primary to the disease.\r"

  ".U": "91079492\r", 
  ".W": "IL-1 is a co-stimulus for T cell proliferation along with TCR cross-linking agents or lectins. Here we demonstrate that IL-1 alpha, in the absence of a TCR stimulus, induces active TGF-beta production by non-proliferating T cells. Thus, in addition to being an incomplete signal, IL-1 alpha alone induced the production of a negative modulator for T cell proliferation. Interestingly, when Con A and IL-1 were combined, active TGF-beta was not detected in supernatants. Production of active TGF-beta protein by T cells in response to IL-1 alpha was established by 1) growth inhibition of the TGF-beta-responsive CCL 64 target cell, 2) neutralization of the activity in supernatants with an anti-TGF-beta mAb, and 3) competition of supernatants with [125I]TGF-beta binding to CCL 64 membranes. The mechanism of IL-1 alpha induction of TGF-beta was examined: IL-1 alpha did not increase TGF beta-1 message over constitutive levels, nor did it induce transcription of TGF-beta 2 message. A latent acid-activatable form of the protein was detected in nonproliferating murine T cells. We therefore suggest that IL-1 alpha regulates TGF-beta expression in T cells through translational and/or post-translational mechanisms. IL-1 regulation of active TGF-beta production by T cells may be a mechanism for controlling the proliferative response of T cells to a co-stimulus, and may be relevant in the pathophysiology of certain chronic inflammatory disease states.\r"

  ".W": "In this study, recombinant human IL-1 alpha (rhIL-1 alpha) was used to protect normal and tumor-bearing BALB/c mice from the acute toxicity caused by lethal doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy) and 5-fluorouracil. Pretreatment of mice for 7 days with 10,000 U/day of rhIL-1 alpha protected 70 to 100% of mice from the acute death induced by lethal doses of both Cy (380 mg/kg) and 5-fluorouracil (250 mg/kg). In contrast, post-treatment of mice with single or multiple doses of rhIL-1 alpha was not chemoprotective. Pretreatment of mice with rhIL-1 alpha increased the acute LD90 of Cy from 380 mg/kg to greater than 500 mg/kg in normal mice, an LD90 dose-modifying effect of at least 1.25, was accompanied by a more rapid recovery from neutropenia and a less severe reduction in the number of bone marrow single lineage monocyte, myeloid, or myelomonocytic colonies. Some of the mice (10 to 50%) that were successfully protected by pretreatment with rhIL-1 alpha died after day 50. These mice consistently presented with extensive pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis at death. Mice bearing murine renal cancer (Renca) were also protected from the acute toxic effects of Cy (450 mg/kg) by pretreatment with rhIL-1 alpha. Renca-bearing mice pretreated with rhIL-1 alpha and either sublethal (300 mg/kg) or lethal (450 mg/kg) doses of Cy exhibited enhanced survival times over those of untreated Renca-bearing mice. Interestingly, the cause of death in Renca-bearing mice that ultimately failed treatment with rhIL-1 alpha plus 300 mg/kg Cy was recurrent tumor, whereas most mice treated with rhIL-1 alpha plus 450 mg/kg Cy had no detectable tumor, although several died from late pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the dose escalation of Cy in rhIL-1 alpha-pretreated mice results in greater antitumor effects of Cy. However, the dose escalation of some cytotoxic agents allowed by the use of myelostimulatory agents can result in late fatal complications not detected in acute toxicity testing.\r"

Combining cell surface iodination, affinity labeling of the released soluble protein, and fluorescence sandwich-ELISA for both IL-2 and IL-2.(soluble)(s)IL-2R beta reactants revealed the presence of IL-2-binding protein in the culture supernatant as soluble forms of IL-2R beta. By using the fluorescence sandwich-ELISA elevated levels of sIL-2R beta were measured in culture supernatants of human T cell leukemia virus I positive T cell lines. In addition to this constitutive production of sIL-2R beta, normal PBMC could release low levels of IL-2R beta by stimulation with PHA. In contrast, this was not found in certain human T cell leukemia virus I negative T cell, B cell and macrophage lines. Immunoprecipitation of the soluble protein with IL-2R beta-specific mAb characterized it as an apparent 50- to 55-kDa molecule that is distinct from the 45-kDa soluble IL-2R alpha. Moreover, 10 to 15% of the total cell surface molecules were released into culture supernatants. These results suggest that the released IL-2R beta might serve as an immunoregulatory function in IL-2 dependent both normal and abnormal immune responses.\r"

  ".W": "An IL-4-dependent T cell clone (LD8) was isolated from the murine IL-2-dependent cytotoxic T cell line C30.1. This clone has lost the capacity to proliferate in response to IL-2 after long-term culture in IL-4. LD8 cells express the p70, but not the p55, subunit of the IL-2R on their cell surface. The number of p70 IL-2R molecules on LD8 cells is comparable with the number of high-affinity IL-2R on the parental C30.1 cell line. LD8 cells can efficiently internalize IL-2 through the p70 IL-2R subunit. Following stimulation by IL-2, LD8 cells up-regulate p70 IL-2R mRNA, but do not express p55 IL-2R mRNA. IL-2-dependent proliferation of LD8 cells was reconstituted after introduction and expression of a human p55 IL-2R cDNA. To further investigate the role of p70 IL-2R, we have measured IL-2-induced proliferation of C30.1 cells in the presence of three anti-p55 IL-2R mAb (5A2, PC61, and 7D4) that recognize different epitopes. Under the experimental conditions used, the combination of anti-p55 IL-2R mAb prevents the formation of high-affinity IL-2R, but does not affect the binding of IL-2 to p70 IL-2R or IL-2 internalization. However, these three mAb inhibit proliferation of C30.1 cells even in the presence of IL-2 concentrations sufficient to saturate p70 IL-2R. Together these results demonstrate that p70 IL-2R alone is not sufficient to transmit IL-2-induced growth signals and that formation of p55-p70 IL-2R complex is required for IL-2-dependent proliferation of murine T cells.\r"

Although this effect has been best characterized for a number of murine type 2 Th cell (Th2) clones, the mechanism(s) by which these cytokines effect this response is unclear. We have examined the effects of IL-1 and IL-4 on IL-1R expression by MD10 cells, and IL-1-responsive murine T cell line. These cells bear specific IL-1R, which bind human and murine IL-1 alpha and -beta. The measured apparent IL-1R dissociation constant ranged from 41 to 255 pM using 125I-HrIL-1 alpha. Cross-linking studies demonstrated two different 125I-HrIL-1 alpha binding complexes having Mr of 70,000 and 130,000 to 156,000. When removed from passage conditions and placed in non-growth factor-supplemented media, MD10 IL-1R expression spontaneously increased two- to fourfold over the first 11 to 12 h of culture followed by a decline. This phenomenon is partially inhibitable by cycloheximide suggesting that protein synthesis is involved. In agreement with other reports, HrIL-1 alpha down-regulated the expression of its own receptor with an ED50 of between 1 and 10 pM HrIL-1 alpha for this effect. In most experiments, low amounts of HrIL-1 alpha (1.0, 0.1 pM) significantly augmented IL-1R expression. Scatchard analysis of data obtained with all HrIL-1 alpha treatment conditions showed that the effects were due to a change in receptor number, not affinity. Significantly, purified murine IL-4 (MpIL-4) augmented MD10 IL-1R expression in both a time- and dose-dependent fashion. In the presence of 50 U/ml MpIL-4, MD10 IL-1R expression increased two- to threefold after 24 h without a change in receptor affinity. When MpIL-4 (50 U/ml) and various amounts of HrIL-1 alpha (.01-1000 pM) were co-added, the down-regulatory effect of high levels of HrIL-1 alpha was significantly antagonized. When added to cultures after 24 h of HrIL-1 alpha (100 pM) treatment, MpIL-4 reversed the IL-1R down-regulatory effect induced by high levels of HrIL-1 alpha. Finally, when combined in MD10 proliferation assays, MpIL-4 synergistically enhanced the proliferation of MD10 cells treated with suboptimal levels of HrIL-1 alpha.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Cells cultured in the presence or absence of LPS were analyzed using in vitro synthesized 35S-labeled sense or antisense RNA probes to determine the relative abundance and the cell type expressing each of the mRNA for these potent inflammatory mediators. The results indicated that 72% of the LPS-stimulated PBM expressed detectable levels of IL-1 alpha mRNA, 89% IL-1 beta mRNA, and 10% TNF-alpha transcripts. Thus, the majority of activated PBM produced both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta. Experiments combining immunofluorescence for IL-1 beta protein with in situ hybridization for TNF-alpha mRNA demonstrated that monocytes expressing TNF-alpha mRNA also produced IL-1 beta. Primary synoviocytes from four patients with RA were also examined for the mRNA expression of each cytokine. Northern blot analyses of total RNA isolated from 0 to 72 h after LPS- or mock-stimulation showed that IL-1 beta mRNA was the most abundantly expressed, followed by TNF-alpha. In situ hybridization revealed that IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha transcripts were detected exclusively in synovial tissue macrophages. IL-1 alpha mRNA was not detected in these cultures by either method.\r"

  ".W": "Cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage are known to produce urokinase type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and are active participants in the inflammatory response. Modulation of cellular u-PA production, for instance in response to LPS, may have an important impact on the evolution of inflammatory lesions. A definitive picture of how monocyte u-PA production and activity are regulated by LPS is lacking. We addressed this issue directly by measuring u-PA Ag and activity in mononuclear cell cultures. By using a competition ELISA to quantitate u-PA Ag, we found that LPS-stimulated mononuclear cells in culture increased u-PA production in a dose-dependent manner and that all the u-PA detected was attributable to the monocytes therein. Increasing amounts of u-PA were secreted into the medium, bound to the cell surface, and found intracellularly. Although the absolute amounts of u-PA varied from donor to donor, the increases seen with LPS stimulation were a consistent and statistically significant finding. Only the cell-surface-bound u-PA was fibrinolytically active, however, with this activity increasing upon LPS stimulation. All monocyte cell-surface-associated fibrinolytic activity was attributed to u-PA, as shown by plasminogen dependence, neutralization by antibodies to u-PA, and identification of fibrinolytically active molecules eluted from the cell surface. The surface bound u-PA was not inhibited by its physiologic inhibitors, PAI-1 or PAI-2, whereas free u-PA was. Hence LPS stimulation results in monocytes exhibiting increased cell-surface-associated u-PA Ag and fibrinolytic activity, in spite of concomitant high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 production. This surface-bound enzymatic activity may influence the ability of monocytes to migrate in and interact with an inflammatory microenvironment.\r"

  ".W": "Inhibitory factors towards IL-1 have been identified in the urine and in the supernatants of human monocyte cultures and have been shown to act as receptor antagonists. We have investigated whether a natural inhibitor purified from human urine (uIL-1ra) and a recombinant molecule expressed using the gene for an IL-1 antagonist isolated from monocytes (rIL-1ra) can alter responses to human rIL-1 alpha in organ cultures of fetal rat long bones and neonatal mouse calvariae. The two preparations probably contained similar or identical molecules, because an antibody to rIL-1ra reacted with uIL-1ra by Western blot analysis. uIL-1ra and rIL-1ra specifically blocked stimulation of bone resorption by rIL-1 in both culture systems, as well as the increase in PGE2 production in cultured calvariae. Resorptive effects of parathyroid hormone and TNF-alpha were not blocked. The uIL-1ra preparation had some intrinsic resorbing activity, but on gel chromatography this appeared in fractions that eluted earlier than uIL-1ra. Concentration ratios of rIL-1ra to rIL-1 as low as 10 could block the resorptive response of fetal rat long bones, whereas concentration ratios of 100 to 1000 were required to block IL-1 action on neonatal mouse calvariae. The inhibitory effects appeared to be competitive, because increasing concentrations of IL-1 overcame the block of bone resorption in both systems and the inhibition of PGE2 production in calvariae.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelial cell incubated with IL-1 have been shown adhere more lymphocytes than nontreated endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-1 can also increase lymphocyte penetration through endothelial monolayers in vitro. IL-1 induced a transient increase in the number of lymphocytes penetrated through the endothelial monolayer into a filter in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect could be mimicked by increasing the cytosolic cAMP levels in the endothelial cells either by forskolin or dibutyryl-cAMP. Concomitantly we were able to show that IL-1 increased the cytosolic cAMP levels in endothelial cells. An inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, ddAdo, decreased both the IL-1-induced cAMP elevation and lymphocyte penetration. A protein kinase A inhibitor HA 1004 could inhibit the IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration, where as protein kinase C (N-(2-guamidino-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesyl foamide hydrocloride) and calcium-calmodulin (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalensulfanamide) inhibitors had no effect. Adding dibutyryl-cGMP or calcium ionophore to the endothelial cells could not mimic IL-1-induced penetration and finally IL-1 did not induce PKC translocation in endothelial cells. These data support the view that IL-1 acts via cAMP as a second messenger in regard to lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells. The above data demonstrate that IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells and that this IL-1-induced signal is transduced via cAMP in endothelial cells.\r"

The present study was undertaken to determine the role of circulating IC in causing low E-CR1 levels. E-CR1 were enumerated by measuring the binding of anti-CR1 mAb (E11) and rabbit anti-CR1 antibodies (RbaCR1) to E. In addition, the distribution of CR1 among E was assessed by flow cytometry of E stained with E11 and RbaCR1 and by evaluating the binding of E11-coated fluorescent beads (E11-beads) to E. E11-beads bind to clusters of CR1 on E. Five cynomolgus monkeys (CYN) were preimmunized to bovine gamma-globulin (BGG). E-CR1 changes in these animals were assessed: 1) acutely, during the first 60 min after an infusion of BGG and 2) chronically, during daily administration of BGG infusions over 2 wk. Acutely, there was a decrease in the number of E-CR1 as measured by E11 binding to E (E11/CR1). This decrease was not attributable to occupancy of CR1 by IC because the decrease in E11/CR1 number persisted after the IC had been cleared from E. By comparing the E11/CR1 levels in arterial blood to hepatic vein blood (n = 5), or in pulmonary artery blood (n = 1), we determined that the acute decrease in E11/CR1 number did not occur whereas E circulated through liver, spleen, or lung. The decrease in E11/CR1 number required the binding of IC to E because it did not occur after BGG was infused into nonimmunized CYN (n = 2) or into a preimmunized complement-depleted CYN. The decrease in E11/CR1 number was not due to loss of CR1 from E because E11/CR1 number recovered 24 h after infusion of BGG and in addition, enumeration of E-CR1 with RbaCR1 and E11-beads did not reflect a decrease in E-CR1 number. After several daily BGG infusions there was a persistent decrease in E-CR1 levels and that decrease appeared to be mainly the result of loss of CR1 from E because the decrease was confirmed with all methods of E-CR1 measurement and because E-CR1 levels recovered only slowly after BGG infusions were discontinued. Both in vitro and in vivo IC bound preferentially to subpopulations of E, identified by their ability to bind multiple E11-beads and by their high intensity staining with the anti-CR1 antibodies E11 and RbaCR1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have synthesized a free peptide capable of eliciting antibodies that neutralize toxin alpha from Naja nigricollis, a protein that binds specifically to the acetylcholine nicotinic receptor. Of the five tested fragments that encompassed the whole toxin sequence, only fragment 24-41 stimulated T cells from BALB/c mice primed with the whole toxin and conversely, only T cells from mice primed with fragment 24-41 could be stimulated by both the toxin and priming peptide. No other peptides had such properties, indicating that only fragment 24-41 possessed T determinant(s) in BALB/c mice (H-2d haplotype). In agreement with the current view that B cell proliferation requires specific T cell stimulation, only fragment 24-41 elicited an antibody response. However, the antipeptide antisera failed to bind to the native toxin and thereby to neutralize it. Instead, it recognized an unfolded form of the toxin. The peptide 24-41 was then made cyclic. A circular dichroism analysis revealed that, in organic solvent, this peptide had a tendency to adopt a beta-sheet structure, as in the folded toxin, whereas the linear peptide adopted an helical structure. The cyclic peptide not only remained T stimulating but elicited antisera that recognized and neutralized the native toxin. Furthermore, the antisera cross-reacted with several toxin variants. Our data show, therefore, that it is possible to give an appropriate B cell specificity directly to a T cell-stimulating peptide, an approach that may be of value for the design of synthetic vaccines.\r"

  ".W": "The Ku (p70/p80) autoantigen is a DNA-protein complex recognized by sera from certain patients with SLE and related diseases. Although human autoantibodies react with at least eight different epitopes of the human Ku complex, they had little reactivity with rodent Ku Ag on immunoblots. Small amounts of 70- and 80-kDa proteins were immunoprecipitated from murine cell extracts, however, suggesting that the Ku particle is not unique to human cells. This was confirmed by isolating cDNA clones encoding murine Ku Ag by plaque hybridization with a human p70 cDNA probe. The murine p70 cDNA clones had a deduced amino acid sequence 82.9% identical to that of human p70, and comparable amounts of murine and human p70 mRNA were detected in 3T3 and K562 cells, respectively. The poor reactivity of human autoantibodies with murine p70 was attributable to specific amino acid substitutions in an immunodominant conformational epitope located on amino acids 560-609 of human p70. Several amino acids critical for antigenicity of this region were defined by mutagenesis studies. Other conformational epitopes of Ku were also antigenically poorly conserved among species. Species-specific epitopes recognized by lupus autoantibodies are unusual but not unique to Ku. In general, poorly conserved autoepitopes have been conformational, rather than sequential, suggesting that the antigenicity of conformational epitopes may be particularly sensitive to evolutionary change.\r"

Four of five rabbits produced Ig typical of lupus autoantibodies: individual rabbit Ig cross-reacted with multiple autoantigens including nucleic acids, cardiolipin, SmRNP, glomerular extract, laminin, and exogenous Ag. Rabbit anti-Id against human anti-dsDNA antibodies were highly specific for dsDNA. Notably, in each serum the autoantibody activity was confined to the anti-Id Ig fraction. A similar spontaneously occurring Id-anti-Id interaction was also found between anti-ssDNA and anti-dsDNA antibodies isolated from an individual lupus patient. These results indicate that lupus autoantibodies which share Ag binding properties with pathogenic Ig, including both cross-reactive and anti-dsDNA antibodies, can induce the production of Ig with similar autoantigen binding properties through immune-network interactions. This phenomenon, if unregulated, could lead to the amplification of pathogenic autoantibody production in individuals with systemic lupus.\r"

Homogeneous populations of acrinar cells were isolated from lacrimal tissues by serial enzymatic digestion and Ficoll gradient centrifugation and then cultured on reconstituted basement membranes in supplemented, serum-free medium. Acinar cell exposure in vitro to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) resulted in a significant increase in cellular SC output. This hormone action was dose dependent and androgen specific. Testosterone, but not 17 beta-estradiol, progesterone, dexamethasone, or aldosterone, also induced a considerable elevation in acinar cell SC production. The effect of testosterone may not require intracellular enzymatic conversion to DHT. The impact of androgens on SC output was associated with enhanced cellular synthesis and secretion and did not involve variations in acinar cell viability or density. Moreover, the SC response to DHT occurred irrespective of whether lacrimal gland acinar cells were obtained from young adult male or female rats. In contrast, the androgen-related rise in SC production was significantly reduced in acinar cells isolated from tissue of orchiectomized and hypophysectomized rats. In summary, these findings demonstrate that androgens directly increase the synthesis of SC by lacrimal gland acinar cells in vitro. This effect, however, may be significantly altered by prior changes in the endocrine environment of acinar cells in vivo.\r"

The potentiality of colony formation in methylcellulose was not reduced by treatment of various concentrations of compound 48/80, substance P and TPA. When degranulation was induced by compound 48/80, substance P or TPA, proportion of highly degranulated mast cells containing less than five granules was rather small. In contrast, considerable proportion of highly degranulated mast cells was obtained after the treatment with the low concentration (0.1 microgram/ml) of A23187. These highly degranulated mast cells, which were individually picked up by the micromanipulator, proliferated not only in methylcellulose but also in the skin of mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice. Inasmuch as we have already shown the proliferation of IgE-sensitized and Ag-stimulated mast cells, degranulated mast cells appear to retain the proliferative potential in general.\r"

  ".U": "91079514\r", 
  ".W": "To approach the mechanisms whereby IL-2 activates human NK cells, we have compared the effects of IL-4 and of Bt2cAMP on this activation. Both agents block completely the proliferation induced by IL-2 on highly purified CD3-negative human NK cells. We also report that the net LAK response of PBL is inhibited by IL-4 and cAMP. However, kinetics analysis showed that IL-4 appears to inhibit an early stage of IL-2-induced activation of NK cells. IL-4 does not affect the cytotoxicity of freshly isolated NK cells against the K562 target and is ineffective on IL-2-preactivated cells. In contrast, cAMP primarily blocks the lytic effector phase, whether cells have been cultured in IL-2 or not, and its effect appears independent of time of addition. These differences between the activity of IL-4 and cAMP suggested that cAMP was not directly involved in IL-4 signal transduction in human NK cells. Consistent with this interpretation, we did not observe any variation in the level of intracellular cAMP concentrations when NK cells were stimulated with IL-4, or when they are stimulated with IL-2 or IL-2 plus IL-4. In addition, we also demonstrate that NK cell cytotoxic activation induced by IL-2 is still demonstrable in the presence of Bt2cAMP under conditions in which NK cell proliferation is blocked. These results clearly indicate that the differentiative effect of IL-2 on NK cells is independent of cell proliferation. Furthermore, the p70-75 IL-2R-initiated signal transduction pathway that leads to increased cytotoxicity appears not to be susceptible to inhibition by cAMP in human NK cells.\r"

FcR expression was dependent on the initial bacterial density (greater than or equal to 8 x 10(7) cfu/ml) and on phagocytosis of the staphylococci, but not on new protein synthesis. IgG labeled SRBC binding was blocked by aggregated IgG but not IgM. SRBC coated with the F(ab')2 portion of IgG did not bind, thus confirming that FcR were specifically involved in this interaction.

  ".W": "Lipophosphoglycan (LPG) and glycosyl phosphatidylinositol Ag (GPI), are glycolipids present on the membrane of Leishmania parasites. Both glycolipids have been chemically characterized. LPG is a polysaccharide of repeating phosphorylated units linked to a phosphocarbohydrate core that is anchored to the membrane by lysoalkyl phosphatidylinositol (PI). The GPI are smaller glycolipids with a structure resembling the phosphocarbohydrate core of the LPG. They are anchored to the membrane by alkyl acyl PI. Their relative abundance, uniqueness of structure, and cellular location suggest a role in interactions of the parasites with host cells. In the present study we examined the effect of LPG and GPI on the activation of human peripheral blood monocytes. Three parameters were studied: the production of IL-1, chemotactic locomotion, and oxidative burst. We found that whereas neither GPI nor LPG directly affected monocyte activity, preincubation of the monocytes with LPG strongly inhibited further activation: The production of IL-1, after stimulation with LPS, was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Previous incubation with LPG also inhibited chemotactic locomotion of monocytes and neutrophils in response to diacylglycerol, zymosan-activated serum, FMLP and LTB4. Luminol-dependent chemiluminiscence caused by stimulation of the monocytes with streptococci and histone was also inhibited. After fragmentation of the LPG into phosphoglycan and 1-O-alkylglycerol by phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C, only the phosphoglycan retained inhibitory activity. No difference in inhibitory activity was found between LPG prepared from Leishmania major or Leishmania donovani promastigotes. These results show that the phosphoglycan of LPG inhibits the immunologic response of normal human monocytes and neutrophils, and suggest that LPG may influence the nature of the inflammatory response surrounding infected cells.\r"

  ".W": "The filarial-specific humoral immune response of adult residents of two areas of Papua New Guinea, differing in transmission of Wuchereria bancrofti infection was compared. The majority of residents of the village of Bonahoi, in an area where transmission of filariasis had been interrupted by a 20-year insecticide spray program to control malaria, showed no parasitologic signs of active W. bancrofti infection and were negative for both circulating phosphorylcholine Ag and peripheral blood microfilariae. In contrast, adult residents of the village of Nanaha were in an area exposed to infection, and were phosphorylcholine-Ag- and microfilariae-positive. The antibody response of these two groups to both adult worm excretory/secretory (ES) Ag and somatic antigen extract was examined to determine which components of the filarial-specific immune response were dependent on active infection. Identification of these immune responses may point to immunologic methods to evaluate control programs for lymphatic filariasis. Adults from Bonahoi were found to have significant immune responses to [35S] methionine-labeled ES Ag by immunoprecipitation and to adult somatic antigen extracts by ELISA and by immunoblotting. This result is consistent with the fact that these individuals were previously exposed to and/or infected with W. bancrofti. Similarly, residents of the endemic village had detectable immune responses to these Ag irrespective of if they were microfilaremic. The most striking immunologic difference observed between the two groups was that residents of Bonahoi had a dramatically reduced filarial-specific IgG4 antibody response to both adult somatic Ag and adult ES Ag. These data suggest that longitudinal measurement of filarial-specific IgG4 levels may be a useful seroepidemiologic indicator of changes in W. bancrofti infection status.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of serum resistance for infective promastigotes of Leishmania major was investigated. Prior results suggested that the mechanism of resistance was mediated at a step after C3 deposition. Equivalent amounts of C3b were deposited on serum-susceptible, noninfective promastigotes harvested from log stage cultures (LOG) and on C-resistant, infective, metacyclic promastigotes (MP) purified from stationary stage cultures. Whereas binding of C9 to LOG was stable during incubation in serum, C9 binding to MP was minimal and unstable, because molecules bound initially to MP were released with continued incubation. Failure to bind C9 was not a result of inability to activate C; the kinetics of C3, C6, and C9 consumption were similar for LOG and MP. Deposition of C5b-7 on MP was stable, indicating that the initial steps in terminal complex formation were intact. Instead, the majority of C5b-9 formed on MP was spontaneously released into the serum as SC5b-9. Residual C5b-9 on MP was released with 1 M NaCl. These data show that developmental modification of the promastigote membrane during transition from a noninfective to an infective stage blocks insertion of lytic C5b-9 into the promastigote membrane.\r"

Upon oral feeding of the recombinant salmonellae to mice, the rate of seroconversion to anti-HBc was dependent on the salmonella strain used. With the best carrier strain high titer anti-HBc antibodies and lower titer anti-pre-S2 serum IgG antibodies were observed two weeks after a single oral immunization. The Ig class and IgG subclass distribution of anti-HBc antibodies after i.p. and oral immunization is consistent with the induction of functional T cell help.\r"

In this work a cDNA clone encoding the CD53 Ag was isolated from a COS cell-expression library. The sequence of the cDNA predicts a protein of 219 residues bearing four putative membrane-spanning hydrophobic domains. Sequence analysis shows that CD53 is related to three other recently described molecules: a melanoma Ag, ME491; a B cell Ag, CD37; and the broadly distributed hemopoietic cell Ag S5.7. Comparison of NH2-terminal protein sequence of OX44 rat Ag and CD53 suggest that CD53 is the human homologue of OX44. In addition, CD53 is distantly related to Escherichia coli lac Y permease, a type III integral membrane protein that ferries lactose into the bacterial cell. CD53 transcripts increase in prevalence after mitogenic stimulation, suggesting that the protein may be involved in the transport of factors essential for cell proliferation.\r"

  ".W": "To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying glucocorticoid-mediated immune suppression, we have exploited cDNA cloning and subtractive screening methods to identify glucocorticoid-regulated transcripts in the mouse macrophage-like cell line, P388D1. Two of the three isolated glucocorticoid-regulated mRNA species corresponded to genes potentially important to immunoregulation: one glucocorticoid-suppressed mRNA species probably encoded the previously uncloned 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme that appears important for in vitro immune responses. The other mRNA species showed glucocorticoid-increased mRNA steady-state levels and was transcribed from an endogenous ecotropic type C retroviral locus. This transcript gives rise to a protein (transmembrane retroviral protein, formerly p15E), which, along with its feline and human homologs, has been implicated in immunosuppression caused by mouse, cat, and human retroviruses. Our results raise the possibility that the immunosuppressive activity of glucocorticoids might be mediated, in part, by regulating the expression of the above immunoregulatory proteins.\r"

By immunoscreening of a lambda gt11 cDNA expression library derived from HeLa cells with an anti-Sp100 autoimmune serum a 0.7-kb cDNA (Sp26) coding for a fragment of Sp100 was isolated. Expression of this cDNA and use of the recombinant protein in ELISA revealed that the fragment carries major Sp100 autoepitopes and that anti-Sp100 autoantibodies predominantly occur in patients suffering from primary biliary cirrhosis (50/184). The Sp26 cDNA was used as hybridization probe for isolation of longer cDNA from human liver- and placenta-derived lambda gt10 cDNA libraries. Overlapping fragments were assembled to generate a full length cDNA coding for a protein with a molecular mass of 53 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.7. The Sp100 autoantigen expressed in vitro from this cDNA and authenticated by a capture immunoblot assay, comigrated in SDS-PAGE with the authentic HeLa autoantigen of 95 to 100 kDa and thus showed an aberrant electrophoretic mobility. Computer based protein sequence analysis of the Sp100 autoantigen revealed regions of striking sequence similarities to the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains of various human and non-human MHC class I Ag and to several transacting transcriptional regulatory proteins.\r"

  ".W": "T cell activation results in high levels of HIV replication and is thought to be one mechanism leading to the conversion from latent to active viral infection. In HIV-1, the sequences that respond to these signaling events are found in the long terminal repeat (LTR) and comprise the transcriptional enhancer, which contains two conserved binding sites for the nuclear factor kappa B (NF kappa B). The corresponding region in the second AIDS retrovirus, HIV-2, contains a conserved and a divergent NF kappa B binding site. We demonstrate that the HIV-1 LTR responds better than the HIV-2 LTR to T cell activation signals. These qualitative differences in the response to T cell activation are reproduced not only when HIV-1 or HIV-2 enhancers are placed upstream of a heterologous promoter but also when these enhancers are switched between their respective LTR. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, NF kappa B binds to both conserved sites in the HIV-1 transcriptional enhancer and only to the single conserved site in the HIV-2 transcriptional enhancer. Instead of NF kappa B, the activator protein 3 binds to the divergent site in HIV-2. In conclusion, HIV-1 and HIV-2 are differentially regulated by T cell activation signals, and this difference may account for the longer period of viral latency observed with HIV-2 than with HIV-1 infection.\r"

  ".W": "The formation of lung metastases by i.v.-injected B16 melanoma (F1 and F10 strain) cells in Swiss albino, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation. The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit, a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound, nor-dimaprit, or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide. A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine, tiotidine, famotidine, or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis. Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells, as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1. NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells. The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments, combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis, whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone. The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells.\r"

However, our recent study revealed that molecule(s) other than CD2 and LFA-1 might be involved in the lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity against certain target cells. In order to characterize such unknown molecules, we established a mAb (RMV-7) which could inhibit CD2/LFA-1-independent LAK cell cytotoxicity and binding to target cells at the effector site. The Ag identified by RMV-7 appeared on splenic T cells late after mitogenic stimulation and was a noncovalently linked heterodimer composed of a 140-kDa alpha-chain and a 95-kDa beta-chain. RMV-7 blocked LAK cell binding to fibronectin (FN), fibrinogen, and vitronectin but not that to laminin or type IV collagen, indicating that the RMV-7-defined molecule is a unique extracellular matrix receptor for FN, fibrinogen, and vitronectin. One of its ligand, FN, was found on the surface of several target cells, and LAK cell cytotoxicity against them was blocked by anti-FN antibody at the target site. Similarly, cytotoxicity of a H-2d-specific CTL clone was inhibited by RMV-7 and anti-FN antibody as well. These results indicate that a unique very late activation Ag-like extracellular matrix receptor on murine CTL and LAK cells contributes to target cell binding and cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "Relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) can be induced in SJL/J mice by immunization with spinal cord homogenate and adjuvant. The specific Ag(s) responsible for acute disease and subsequent relapses in this model is unknown. Myelin basic protein (BP), an encephalitogenic peptide of BP (BP 87-99), and proteolipid protein (PLP) can each induce R-EAE in SJL/J mice, and a peptide of PLP (PLP 139-151) has been reported to induce acute EAE. To determine the encephalitogens in cord-immunized mice with R-EAE, the in vitro proliferative responses of lymph node cells (LNC) and central nervous system mononuclear cells to BP, BP peptides, and PLP peptides were examined during acute EAE and during relapses. LNC responded only to PLP peptides 139-151 and 141-151 and did not respond to BP or its peptides during acute or chronic disease. Central nervous system mononuclear cells also preferentially responded to PLP 139-151 and 141-151 during acute and relapsing disease. A PLP 139-151 peptide-specific Th cell line was selected from LNC of cord-immunized donors. Five million peptide-specific line cells transferred severe relapsing demyelinating EAE to naive recipients. We conclude that PLP peptide 139-151 is the major encephalitogen for R-EAE in cord-immunized SJL/J mice. We demonstrate for the first time that Th cells specific for this peptide are sufficient to transfer relapsing demyelinating EAE. The predominance of a PLP immune response rather than a BP response in SJL/J mice suggests that genetic background may determine the predominant myelin Ag response in human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\r"

Macrophages harvested from the peritoneal cavities of these mice at 4 or 9 wk postinoculation with LP-BM5 MuLV were analyzed by Northern hybridization for the presence of the defective LP-BM5 virus and their ability to synthesize various cytokines upon induction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or (LPS). Neither IFN-alpha or IFN-beta was found to be constitutively expressed in LP-BM5-infected macrophages and in NDV induction studies, and the levels of biologically active IFN-alpha and its mRNA were found to be lower in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in the macrophages from uninfected controls. Similarly, after NDV or LPS induction, the levels of TNF mRNA and TNF protein were significantly lower in LP-BM5-infected macrophages than in macrophages from uninfected mice. The LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages constitutively expressed low levels of IL-1 beta, and when induced with LPS, the relative levels of IL-1 beta were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected macrophages. Although no constitutive expression of IL-6 was detected, the levels of IL-6 mRNA induced with NDV were higher in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in controls. Thus, we found alterations in the expression of selected cytokines in macrophages from mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV rather than a general deregulation of all cytokine expression. These results show that macrophages infected with the defective LP-BM5 virus respond differently to NDV- or LPS-stimulation and suggest that aberrant expression of certain cytokine genes may play a role in the immunopathologic condition in mice with murine AIDS.\r"

  ".W": "The role of IL-6 and IL-1 in the regulation of accessory activity and differentiation in the human monocyte/macrophage (Mo/Mph) system was investigated. IL-6 combined with IL-1 had a strong effect on the accessory activity of Mo-derived cells dependent on their state of differentiation in vitro. Fresh Mo prepared from peripheral blood differentiated into potent accessory cells in vitro within 24 h in the absence of exogenous triggers in serum-containing and serum-free medium. Mo cultured for 2 days in the presence of the cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 did not significantly increase their spontaneous accessory activity. However, the simultaneous addition of antibodies against IL-6 and IL-1 to accessory Mo cultures significantly diminished their T cell stimulatory capacity. These findings suggest an important positive feedback role of IL-6 and IL-1, secreted by Mo at this early state of differentiation. In marked contrast, untreated mature Mph generated in vitro from Mo exhibited a low spontaneous accessory potency. However, when these cells were subjected to IL-6 and/or IL-1, we observed a strong dose dependent increase in their potency to stimulate a T cell response. Parameters indicating the differentiation of Mo to Mph, such as acid phosphatase and 5' nucleotidase, were not influenced by the addition of IL-1, IL-6, or a mixture of both and confirmed the presence of mature Mph after 6 days of culture. Based on these observations, we conclude that the monocyte-derived cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 not only directly act on T cells but may also function as a signal for accessory activity during Mo/Mph differentiation.\r"

This activity is unique for IL-7, because it is not shared by other cytokines including IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. IL-7 also induces either de novo or increased expression of the surface markers CD25 (Tac, IL-2R alpha-chain), CD54 (ICAM-1), Mic beta 1 (IL-2R beta-chain) and CD69 (early T cell activation Ag). IL-7-induced LAK activity is independent of IL-2 secretion, because it is not abrogated by IL-2 antisera. The LAK precursor responding to IL-7 stimulation is enriched in the null cell fraction as has been demonstrated for IL-2-induced LAK cells. TGF-beta and IL-4 interfere with generation of LAK activity by IL-7. Anti-IL-4 antiserum enhances IL-7-induced LAK activity and augments induction of surface marker expression by IL-7. This may be indirect evidence that IL-7 stimulation leads to induction of IL-4 activity. Our results describe the activation of mature lymphoid cells by IL-7. This and the previously described role of IL-7 in lymphohemopoiesis makes it a cytokine of potential therapeutic value for treatment of immunodeficiency states and possibly the immunotherapy of cancer.\r"

In this paper we report that, similar to cytotoxic macrophages, natural cytotoxic (NC) cells also use cell-associated TNF to lyse sensitive target cells. However, in contrast to fixed cytotoxic macrophages, NC cells do not retain cytolytic activity after fixation with paraformaldehyde. Additionally, the cytolytic activity of paraformaldehyde-fixed NC cells is not increased by incubation with LPS or by incubation with rTNF before fixation. Western blot analysis indicates that, unlike macrophages, NC cells use a smaller (17 kDa) constitutively active form of TNF. These results indicate that, although both macrophages and NC cells use effector cell-associated TNF to mediate lysis of sensitive targets, the way in which TNF is associated with these two types of effector cells must be different.\r"

The ectoplasmic segment of SC is released into secretions either in a free form (FSC) or bound to PIg as secretory IgA or IgM. The topography of human SC in its free and PIgA-bound form was studied by using mAb directed against each form of SC. Competition experiments identified a minimum of nine SC epitopes, one of which was dependent on an N-glycosidic moiety. Three of the polypeptide-derived epitopes were displayed on denatured, reduced, and alkylated SC, whereas the others were fully or partially dependent on the native conformation of SC. Epitopes recognized by the latter class of antibodies were mapped to discrete domains of SC, based on amino acid sequence and antibody-binding analysis of limited proteolytic fragments. One of the mAb (6G11), which was directed against an epitope on domain I of SC, inhibited the binding of FSC to PIgA. Overall, our results provide evidence that a region within domain I, as well as protease-sensitive interdomain regions of FSC, become masked or altered when SC binds to PIgA. Furthermore, the binding of SC to PIgA results in conformational changes, or formation of combinatorial epitopes, involving regions within domains II and III of SC but not domain V.\r"

  ".W": "In order to target specifically double-Ag-positive cells in vivo, we synthesized chemically two mAb conjugates with specificities for both an allelic murine B cell-surface Ag and for a synthetic hapten. One conjugate was designed for its specificities for I-Ek and for N-epsilon-(2,4-DNP)-amino-caproate, and the other one for its reactivity to Lyb-8.2 and to indium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate. A radiolabeled tracer, containing both the N-epsilon-(2,4-DNP)-amino-caproate and the indium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate haptens, was obtained by reacting diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid dianhydride with mono-[N-epsilon-(2,4-DNP)-amino-caproyl]-tyrosyl-lysine and labeling with indium-111. Mice from various strains (CBA/N: I-Ek+, Lyb-8.2+; AKR/N: I-Ek+, Lyb-8.2-; BALB/c: I-Ek-, Lyb-8.2+; and DBA/2: I-Ek-, Lyb-8.2-) were given simultaneous i.v. injections of microgram amounts of less than anti-[N-epsilon-(2,4-DNP)-amino-caproate], anti-I-Ek greater than and of [anti-(indium-diethylene-triaminepentaacetate), anti-Lyb-8.2] antibody conjugates and picomole amounts of the tracer. As expected, specific uptake of the tracer by the spleen was observed in strains where spleen cells expressed at least one Ag (CBA/N, AKR/N, and BALB/c). Furthermore, spleen cells from the double-Ag-positive mouse strain (CBA/N), when compared with spleen cells from single-positive mouse strains, exhibited a significantly higher uptake of the bivalent hapten. This specificity for double-Ag-positive cells, it is suggested, occurs through the formation of stable complexes between both cell-surface Ag, both conjugates, and the asymmetric bivalent hapten. The use of such asymmetric bivalent haptens, together with matched (anti-hapten, anti-cell) antibody conjugates, is proposed as a general method for increasing the in vivo specificity of immunoimaging and radioimmunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The injection of mice with a foreign, polyclonal antibody to IgD sequentially induces: 1) activation of B cells by cross-linking of their cell membrane (m) IgD; 2) B cell processing and presentation of the bound anti-IgD antibody to T cells; 3) activation of these T cells; and 4) T-dependent stimulation of B cell differentiation into IgG1 secreting cells. To determine whether the cross-linking of B cell membrane IgD and/or the resulting B cell activation that follows contribute to the generation of the polyclonal IgG1 response, we examined the abilities of three sets of anti-delta mAb or mAb fragments to stimulate polyclonal IgG1 production. Within each set mAb were matched for species and Ig isotypic determinants, but differed in avidity for IgD or in ability to cross-link IgD. In addition, experiments were performed to determine whether the anti-delta mAb had to be foreign to the immunized mouse to stimulate an IgG1 response. Results of these experiments indicate that: 1) recognition of the injected anti-delta antibody as foreign is required for the induction of a polyclonal IgG1 response; 2) the cross-linking of B cell membrane Ig, which directly activates B cells, can contribute considerably to the generation of in vivo IgG1 production; and 3) that even relatively weak cross-linking of membrane Ig by ligands that bind it with low avidity can make this contribution.\r"

NK cells can also effect an antibody dependent cytotoxicity that is triggered by CD16, an FcR for IgG. In NK cells, CD16 is expressed in association with zeta, a signal transducing subunit of the TCR complex. Here we show that, just as T cell activation via the TCR complex results in tyrosine phosphorylation of zeta TCR, NK cell activation via CD16 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of zeta NK. Whereas antibody-dependent cytotoxicity also results in tyrosine phosphorylation of zeta, natural cytotoxicity does not. Our results indicate that zeta functions as a transducing element for antibody dependent, but not antibody independent killing by NK cells. Consequently, NK cells are likely to express at least two distinct receptor complexes capable of triggering cytolytic effector function.\r"

PGE1 and isoproterenol, increased PMN cyclic AMP production and inhibited chemotaxis to both FMLP and LTB4. In contrast, forskolin, which activates adenylate cyclase directly, inhibited chemotaxis to FMLP but not to LTB4. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), was required for inhibition of PMN chemotaxis to FMLP by forskolin, PGE1, and isoproterenol. Isoproterenol and PGE1 inhibited PMN chemotaxis to LTB4 in the absence of IBMX and chemotaxis was further inhibited in the presence of IBMX. PMN cAMP levels were stimulated 2- to 3-fold with isoproterenol, 6- to 10-fold with PGE1, and 5- to 7-fold with forskolin over basal levels in the presence of IBMX. These observations demonstrate that total cellular cAMP concentration is not correlated with inhibition of PMN chemotaxis to all stimuli; forskolin, which increased cyclic AMP 5- to 7-fold over basal levels, did not inhibit chemotaxis to LTB4, whereas isoproterenol, which increased cyclic AMP only 2- to 3-fold over basal levels, inhibited chemotaxis to LTB4. PMN cAMP extrusion was determined under basal conditions and in the presence of PGE1, isoproterenol, or forskolin. PMN extruded cAMP under all conditions examined.\r"

  ".W": "An increase in intracellular cAMP level induced the expression of IL-2R alpha-chain, the 55-kDa component of IL-2R complex, in a human NK-like cell line, YT. We show here that forskolin also induces the expression of IL-2R alpha-chain on mouse large granular lymphocytes (LGL) but not on T cells. In contrast, treatment with a combination of phorbol ester and calcium ionophore, which is a strong inducer of IL-2R alpha-chain on T cells, does not induce the expression of the alpha-chain on LGL cells. Forskolin was shown to activate the transcription of IL-2R alpha-chain gene in YT cells as revealed by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. Chemical cross-linking experiments using radio-iodinated IL-2 also supported the enhanced expression of IL-2R alpha-chain by treatment with forskolin. In contrast to the alpha-chain, IL-2R beta-chain was not induced by forskolin as revealed by flow cytofluorometry with a mAb against the beta-chain molecule. These results indicate that the activation of adenylate cyclase induces or/and enhance the expression of IL-2R alpha-chain at the transcriptional level in LGL/NK cells including mouse LGL and human YT cell, which leads to the enhanced expression of high affinity IL-2 receptors.\r"

TNC were prepared from BALB/c mice, cultured in complete medium, and culture supernatants were analyzed for the presence of various metabolites of arachidonic acid. Freshly isolated TNC produced large quantities of PGE2 and 6-keto PGF1 alpha (a stable metabolite of prostacyclin, PGI2). Both of these eicosanoids were produced continuously in culture, after an initial lag period of approximately 2 h. No significant production of the eicosanoids PGD2, thromboxane B2, or leukotrienes B4, C4/D4/E4 was seen in these cultures. Production of PGE2 and PGI2 by TNC was not stimulated by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187, or by cell-cell interactions resulting from coculture of the TNC with free thymocytes. Eicosanoid production in these cultures was not due to production of these substances by cells likely to be present as contaminants, such as T rosettes or free thymocytes. These findings raise the possibility that PGE2 and/or PGI2 may provide signals to thymocytes at a specific developmental stage.\r"

  ".W": "Experimental animals fed zinc-deficient diets are well known for susceptibility to infections and impaired mitogen response and Ig production. However, the levels of zinc deficiency used have generally been severe, not comparable to human populations, and have not addressed neutrophil function. To address this issue we have studied the effect in rhesus monkeys of a well defined moderately zinc-deficient (MZ) diet on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) function. Female adult rhesus monkeys were fed either a control (100 micrograms Zn/g) or MZ (2 micrograms Zn/g) diet for 9 mo with quantitation of PMN chemotaxis, and phagocytosis of opsonized yeast. In addition, membrane potential and secretion responses (changes in 90 degrees light scatter) and changes in PMN shape (forward light scatter shifts) were also measured. When compared to the PMN of animals fed control diets, there was a significant reduction in chemotaxis to FMLP of MZ-fed monkey PMN. Although shape change, cell membrane depolarization, as well as phagocytosis were not significantly different among the two groups, the PMN of MZ animals had significantly lower relative loss of orthogonal light scatter (degranulation) due primarily to a lower resting orthogonal light scatter and also a smaller loss when stimulated with FMLP. In vitro addition of zinc to the cells (25 microM) did not improve chemotaxis, and in fact, was inhibitory for most control and zinc-deficient cells. However, after 2 wk of dietary zinc repletion (100 micrograms Zn/g), chemotaxis in the low zinc group was higher and comparable to the control response. These data indicate that zinc deficiency is associated with an intrinsic PMN defect that specifically affects chemotaxis and is corrected with dietary zinc repletion.\r"

The ability of sCR1 to inhibit the immune complex-mediated inflammation in vivo was tested in a rat reversed passive Arthus reaction model. Administration of sCR1 at the dermal sites reduced the Arthus vasculitis in a dose-dependent manner as judged by both gross and microscopic examination, as well as by immunohistologic localization of C3 and C5b-9 neoantigen deposits. These data suggest that sCR1 inhibits the Arthus reaction by interrupting the activation of the C cascade, hence limiting the detrimental immune complex-induced tissue damage in vivo.\r"

When C3H mice were recipients, the number of thymocytes recoverable from such chimeras (C3H recipient chimeras) was small as compared with that from chimeras for which AKR mice were used as recipients (AKR recipient chimeras) regardless of donor strain. The thymocytes from C3H recipient chimeras showed a profound deficiency in generating proliferative responses to stimulation by anti-CD3 mAb (2C11) or anti-TCR (alpha, beta) mAb (H57-597), even though the expression of CD3 and TCR molecules fell within the same range as that in AKR recipient chimeras. Furthermore, after stimulation with immobilized 2C11, the proportion of IL-2R+ cells in the thymocytes from C3H recipient chimeras was much less than that in AKR recipient chimeras. However, no significant difference in proliferative responses to 2C11 plus PMA, in influx of Ca2+ after stimulation with 2C11 or IL-2 production in response to 2C11 plus PMA or PMA plus A23187 was demonstrated between C3H and AKR recipient chimeras. These findings suggest that the thymocytes from C3H recipient chimeras have a deficiency in the signal transduction system as compared with chimeras for which AKR mice are the recipients. The thymic stromal component involved in this difference in the C3H recipient chimeras is discussed.\r"

Induction of PCA by MHV-3 required live virus and host protein and RNA synthesis. Absolute restriction for induction of PCA was observed at the level of the macrophage. Peritoneal macrophages from resistant parental A/J and RI strains (AXB5) could not be induced to express PCA when stimulated by MHV-3 alone or in the presence of lymphocytes from susceptible and H-2 compatible RI mice (AXB3) although they did respond to endotoxin (LPS). In contrast, macrophages from both susceptible (AXB3) and semisusceptible (AXB1) RI strains of mice expressed a similar increase in PCA after stimulation with MHV-3 in the absence of lymphocytes. The levels of PCA expressed by macrophages in the presence of Thy-1.2+ lymphocytes correlated with susceptibility to disease. Thy-1.2+ lymphocytes from susceptible RI AXB3 mice could induce levels of PCA in macrophages from semisusceptible RI AXB1 mice equivalent to that seen in cultures of macrophages and lymphocytes from susceptible mice. Further subfractionation of Thy-1.2+ cells demonstrated that L3T4+ cells instructed macrophages to produce PCA. Thy-1.2+ cells from MHV-3 immunized resistant AXB5 mice, but not from non-immunized mice, were able to suppress induction of PCA. This suppressor cell activity could be detected 4 days after immunization, reaching maximal activity at day 7 with significant suppression even at 28 days. The PCA was shown to have direct prothrombin cleaving activity (prothrombinase) by ELISA and immunofluorescence staining using the mAb 3D4.3. These results demonstrate that induction of a unique PCA (prothrombinase) is restricted at the level of the macrophage and define a regulatory role for T lymphocytes in its induction.\r"

We found that although association with the different DR molecules mapped to identical or closely overlapping regions of the peptide, distinct substitutions could drastically influence the capacity of the peptide to interact with one but not another of the three DR molecules tested. Based on analysis of the distribution of residues recognized by T cell clones restricted to the different DR alleles, we suggest that the peptide CS.T3 is not bound, at least for the three DR examined, as an alpha-helix. In addition we tested three subtypes of DRw11 as APC for the CS.T3 analogues and observed that the peptide is most likely bound in the same conformation to the three natural variants of the DRw11 molecule.\r"

A surface protein Ag with a molecular mass of 190 kDa of S. mutans (PAc) is receiving attention as an anticaries vaccine. We have recently determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for PAc. In this study, four peptides were synthesized on the basis of amino acid sequence of PAc. Among these peptides, PAc(301-319) corresponding to the alanine-rich repeating amino acid region was the most strongly bound by polyclonal murine anti-rPAc antibodies. The peptide partially inhibited the binding of polyclonal anti-rPAc antibodies to rPAc. The peptide induced the proliferation of T cells from BALB/c mice immunized with rPAc. Subcutaneous immunization with PAc(301-319) or rPAc emulsified in CFA/IFA induced high serum IgG responses to rPAc and PAc(301-319). In addition, serum IgG responses to a surface protein Ag with a molecular mass of 210 kDa of Streptococcus sobrinus were elicited in mice immunized by s.c. injection with PAc(301-319) or rPAc. Intranasal immunization with PAc(301-319) coupled to cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) or with rPAc and free CTB induced high serum IgG responses to rPAc. The immunization with PAc(301-319) coupled to CTB or rPAc and free CTB suppressed the colonization of murine teeth by S. mutans. These results suggest that intranasal immunization with the peptide or rPAc may be effective for the prevention of dental caries.\r"

  ".W": "mAb directed against the TCR/CD3 complex activate resting T cells. However, TCR/CD3 signaling induces death by apoptosis in immature (CD4+CD8+) murine thymocytes and certain transformed leukemic T cell lines. Here we show that anti-TCR and anti-CD3 mAb induce growth arrest of cloned TCR-gamma delta + T cells in the presence of IL-2. In the absence of exogenous IL-2, however, the very same anti-TCR/CD3 mAb stimulated gamma delta (+)-clones to proliferation and IL-2 production. In the presence of exogenous IL-2, anti-TCR/CD3 mAb induced the degradation of DNA into oligosomal bands of approximately 200 bp length in cloned gamma delta + T cells. This pattern of DNA fragmentation is characteristic for the programmed cell death termed apoptosis. These results demonstrate that TCR/CD3 signaling can induce cell death in cloned gamma delta + T cells. In addition, this report is the first to show that apoptosis triggered by TCR/CD3 signaling is not restricted to CD4+CD8+ immature thymocytes and transformed leukemic T cell lines but can be also observed with IL-2-dependent normal (i.e., TCR-gamma delta +) T cells.\r"

  ".W": "Two truncated human C5 clones, pHC5A and pHC5B, were isolated from an adult human liver cDNA library, and contained inserts of 2930 and 2181 bp, respectively. Both clones were polyadenylated and encoded the 5'-end of the C5 pro-molecule, thereby completing the human pro-C5 cDNA sequence. However, near the 3'-ends, at exon/intron boundaries, the nucleotide sequences of pHC5A and pHC5B diverged from each other and from the full-length 6.0-kb C5 cDNA sequence. Clone pHC5A, which overlapped the first human C5 clone described (J-16), encoded most of the C5 signal peptide, the complete beta-chain, the linker peptide, 177 amino acids of the alpha-chain, and contained 144 bp of Alu family consensus sequence encoding 48 amino acids of divergent protein sequence in an open reading frame. Clone pHC5B encoded the entire C5 signal peptide, the beta-chain, the linker peptide, nine amino acids of the alpha-chain, and six amino acids of divergent protein sequence in an open reading frame. Northern blot experiments demonstrated the presence of a 3.0-kb truncated C5 mRNA in adult human liver and a 4.8-kb truncated C5 mRNA in HepG2 cells in addition to the 6.0-kb full-length transcript. Truncated C5 mRNA were not detected in Raji, MOLT-4, human fibroblast or U937 cells, although the full-length 6.0-kb transcript was seen in MOLT-4 cells. Southern blot analyses indicated that the human C5 structural gene is large, complex, and is present in the human genome in a single copy, thereby demonstrating that the truncated C5 clones and mRNA are derived from a single C5 gene by alternative processing events.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated and deduced the structure of the beta Fc gamma RII gene from the mouse. This gene spans approximately 18 kb of DNA; the structure and nucleotide sequence has been determined and potential regulatory sites identified. This gene is composed of 10 exons that give rise to the beta 1 and beta 2 Fc gamma RII cDNA. Four exons encode the 5' untranslated region and leader sequence, one exon for each Ig-binding domain and membrane-spanning region and three exons encoding the cytoplasmic tail and 3' untranslated region. Analysis of the gene structure indicated that the beta 1Fc gamma RII and beta 2Fc gamma RII arise by differential mRNA splicing when a single 141-bp exon (exon 8) is alternately spliced to give rise to these isoforms. Sequence analysis of 2 kbp upstream of the transcription start site indicated the presence of regulatory elements, including three binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1, and Ap-4 binding site, a tandem glucocorticoid response element, and an overlapping tandem repeat. Furthermore, as in the Thy-1 gene, no CAT or TATA consensus sequences were observed. In addition, sites of methylation that regulate expression of this gene were also located at the 5' end of the gene and within several introns. A large intron located between exons 4 and 5 also contained a series of purine/pyrimidine-rich regions and a potential enhancer sequence.\r"

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and Southwestern blotting experiments were used to detect the binding of cellular transactivation factor NF-KB to the double repeat-KB enhancer sequence located in the long terminal repeat. PMA treatment, and not retinoic acid treatment of the U937 cells acts in inducing NF-KB expression in the nuclei. In nuclear extracts from monocytes or macrophages, induction of NF-KB occurred only if the cells were previously infected with HIV-1. When U937 cells were infected with HIV-1, no induction of NF-KB factor was detected, whereas high level of progeny virions was produced, suggesting that this factor was not required for viral replication. These results indicate that in monocytic cell lineage, HIV-1 could mimic some differentiation/activation stimuli allowing nuclear NF-KB expression.\r"

We have detected VLA-4 and VLA-5, but not VLA-3, on fresh CD3-, CD16+, CD56+ human NK cells by flow cytometry and immunochemical analyses using mAb directed against beta-1, alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 subunits. Binding assays, performed on FN-coated plates, showed that NK cells specifically adhere to FN and their binding capacity is increased by MgCl2 but not by CaCl2. Using as inhibitory probes a polyclonal antibody against the beta-1 chain of the human FN receptor, the synthetic peptide GRGDSP, which is able to inhibit cellular adhesion mediated by VLA-5, the CS1 fragment, which contains the principal adhesion site in the IIICS domain recognized by VLA-4, and functional mAb directed against alpha-4 or alpha-5 subunits, we show that both VLA-4 and VLA-5 mediate the adhesion of human NK cells to FN. The expression of these integrin receptors may be relevant for NK interaction with extracellular matrix components and other cell types.\r"

Lymphokine-activated killer cell- or CTL-mediated death was inhibited in target cells where transcription or translation were blocked. Dying target cells showed ultrastructural changes typically associated with both apoptosis and necrosis. In contrast, target cells pretreated with macromolecular synthesis inhibitors and incubated with lymphokine-activated killer cells showed morphologic signs of necrosis only. Zn2+, an inhibitor of endonucleases, inhibited DNA fragmentation, but not 51Cr release in YAC-1 target cells, suggesting that the two effects can be dissociated. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of perforin, a pore-forming protein of killer lymphocytes that is known to cause necrotic death, was unaffected by the inhibition of either RNA or protein synthesis in target cells. Taken together, these results suggest that killer lymphocytes can induce both necrosis and apoptosis and that the two types of death can be dissociated with specific inhibitors.\r"

  ".U": "91079580\r", 
  ".W": "Previous studies have shown that a subpopulation of circulating human B cells expresses the Leu 8 peripheral lymph node homing receptor homologue and that these B cells are capable of producing Ig in response to staphylococcus A Cowan I (SAC). In the present study the effect of a signal delivered via the Leu 8 molecule (using anti-Leu 8 mAb) on B cells was examined. Initially, it was shown that immobilized anti-Leu 8 suppressed IgM and IgG secretion of B cells activated by SAC + IL-2 but not that by PWM-prestimulated B cells or B cells stimulated with PWM in the presence of CD4+, Leu 8- T cells (a source of helper cells). It was also shown that anti-Leu 8 did not suppress SAC + IL-2-stimulated B cell proliferation or expression of IL-2R alpha-chain or c-myc mRNA in B cells. The addition of T cells, monocytes, purified IL-2, rIL-1, rIL-6, or human B cell growth factor did not overcome the inhibitory effect of anti-Leu 8 on SAC-stimulated B cell Ig production, and the inhibitory effect of anti-Leu 8 was not blocked by anti-TGF-beta. Finally, inhibition of B cell differentiation occurred even when anti-Leu 8 was added up to 72 hrs after initiation of cell culture. Thus, anti-Leu 8 is unique among inhibitors of B cell function in that it can down-regulate immunoglobulin synthesis without affecting B cell proliferation. These findings suggest that a natural ligand for Leu 8 could affect not only homing of B cells, but also B cell differentiation.\r"

TS 43 mAb precipitated from 125I-radiolabeled T cells a 67-kDa band, which comigrated with the 67-kDa band precipitated by the anti-CD5 mAb OKT1. Preclearing of cell lysates with OKT1 mAb abolished the capacity of TS 43 mAb to precipitate radiolabeled material from T cell lysates. Furthermore, a mouse T cell hybridoma transfected with human CD5 was stained by TS 43 mAb. T cell proliferation mediated by TS 43 mAb was monocyte dependent, and was accompanied by IL-2R expression and by IL-2 synthesis. T cell activation by TS 43 mAb involved a rise in intracellular calcium level (CA2+)i and was dependent on the expression of the TCR/CD3 complex because no rise in (Ca2+)i was observed in a TCR-beta-deficient Jurkat T cell mutant. This study indicates that CD5 should be added to the list of surface molecules that can signal T cells to proliferate.\r"

Spontaneous in vitro synthesis of anti-HIV-1 antibodies, as well as total Ig production, were dramatically reduced by accessory cell, but not T cell removal. This fall was counteracted by addition of rIL-6, but not other cytokines, to monocyte-depleted cultures; moreover, antisera against IL-6 suppressed spontaneous anti-HIV-1 antibody synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. Although IL-6 apparently sustained HIV-1-specific B cell activation, no increase in serum IL-6 levels was observed; PBMC from seropositive subjects did not produce increased amounts of IL-6 in vitro, compared to seronegative controls, both spontaneously and in the presence of LPS stimulation; finally, no constitutive expression of IL-6 gene could be documented in freshly isolated PBMC. These findings indicate that IL-6 may play a central role in HIV-1-specific B cell activation in seropositive patients, and further stress the importance of this cytokine during HIV-1 infection.\r"

IL-1 beta production was demonstrated biologically as the stimulation of proliferation of the cloned IL-1-dependent murine T cell line D10.G4.1 in the presence of a submitogenic concentration of PHA. In a representative experiment, 3H-thymidine uptake increased from 57826 cpm in the presence of supernatants obtained from unstimulated cells to 200774 cpm with supernatants from monocytes stimulated by IgE/alpha IgE immune complexes. By ELISA, IgE complexes increased IL-1 beta production from 0.54 +/- 0.06 ng (per 10(6) monocytes) to 2.60 +/- 0.62 ng (p less than 0.01; mean of eight experiments) and TNF-alpha production from 0.17 +/- 0.10 ng to 3.00 +/- 0.54 ng (p less than 0.01; mean of four experiments). No IL-1 alpha secretion was observed. RNA hybridization analysis demonstrated that IL-1 beta production represented de novo synthesis of the cytokine. Stimulated RNA production was observed after a minimal 1/2-h incubation and was maximal at 2 h. The IgE-dependent secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines by mononuclear phagocytic cells may contribute to the inflammation characteristic of allergic responses.\r"

The binding site (Fc gamma IBS) appeared to be primarily associated with goblet cells, to consist of greater than 200,000 Da and 78,000 Da components, and to be distinct from leukocyte FcR. In the present work, we used mAb made to colonocyte IgG-binding material to more accurately define the molecular structure and cellular locations of the Fc gamma IBS. In immunoblot and fast protein liquid chromatography analysis, the mAb revealed that the Fc gamma IBS consists of a 110,000- to 140,000-Da component in addition to the two components previously recognized. The greater than 200,000 component may be the critical component for IgG binding, inasmuch as mAb to it but not to the other two components inhibited binding of IgG to colonic sections in vitro. Used in immunoelectron microscopy, the mAb documented that the Fc gamma IBS is present in the endoplasmic reticulum of goblet cells, in the cytoplasmic matrix separating secretory granules of goblet cells, and within the granules themselves; occasionally it has the appearance of being secreted into the intestinal lumen with mucus. The Fc gamma IBS could not be solubilized from colonocyte homogenates by three different detergents, which suggests that it exists in complex with cytoskeletal elements. We speculate that the Fc gamma IBS aids in immunologic protection of the intestine by facilitating interaction between intestinal mucus and antigenic material in the lumen.\r"

A coculture system was used in which PBMC from healthy donors were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of cocaine before activation with PHA. Cocultures were then constituted with PBMC infected with a clinical isolate of HIV-1. HIV-1 replication, which was assessed by the measurement of HIV-1 p24 antigen levels in coculture supernatants, was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner by cocaine with maximal stimulation at a concentration of 10(-9) M (965 +/- 196 vs 303 +/- 80 pg p24 Ag/ml in control cocultures). Antibodies to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) blocked cocaine-enhanced HIV-1 replication and purified TGF-beta stimulated viral replication in a manner similar to that observed with cocaine. Augmentation of HIV-1 replication by TGF-beta was maximal at a concentration of 0.01 ng/ml; however, viral proliferation appeared to be inhibited by concentrations of TGF-beta of 1 ng/ml or greater. Taken together, these results indicate that cocaine augments the replication of HIV-1 in PHA-activated PBMC via a mechanism that appears to involve TGF-beta.\r"
