  ".W": "The occurrence of neurologic abnormalities is described in a series of nine infants with chronic hypertension, in whom antihypertensive therapy decreased BP markedly and for a prolonged period, although to levels often within the normal range. All infants had mean systolic BPs greater than 113 mm Hg and elevated renin values to a mean of 134 +/- 128 ng/mL/h. Antihypertensive therapy, such as captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin I-converting enzyme, consistently lowered the systolic BP by 20% from baseline per dose. However, the nine infants exhibited a total of 17 episodes of striking decreases in systolic BP of greater than 40% from baseline; the markedly decreased systolic BP values were usually within the normal range for corrected age. Seven of the 17 episodes were characterized by marked decrease in systolic BP, ie, decreased by 57% +/- 10%, and were prolonged, ie, remained at the lower values for 17 +/- 6 hours despite therapeutic interventions. These seven episodes were accompanied by oliguria (urine output less than 1 mL/kg/h) and neurologic abnormalities (ie, seizures). In the remaining ten episodes, the systolic BP decreased by 50% +/- 8%, but the decreases were relatively brief, ie, remained at the lower values for 2.8 +/- 2 hours. These briefer episodes were not accompanied by renal or neurologic signs. These data indicate a particular vulnerability of the cerebral and renal circulation in premature infants with chronic hypertension to decreases in systolic BP to levels that would otherwise be considered in the normal range. The findings suggest that adaptive responses in both cerebral and renal blood flow are altered by chronic hypertension in such infants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Many women whose premature infants are hospitalized in a newborn intensive care unit choose to express breast milk for their babies. Yet anxiety, fatigue, and emotional stress are powerful inhibitors of lactation. To facilitate the breast-feeding experience, intervention mothers were given a 20-minute audio cassette tape based on relaxation and visual imagery techniques. At a single follow-up expression of milk at the hospital approximately 1 week after enrollment, they expressed 63% more breast milk than a randomized group of control mothers. The fat content of the breast milk in the two groups was not significantly different. Among a small group of mothers whose infants were receiving mechanical ventilation, the increase in milk volume compared with that of control mothers was 121%. Longer-term effects of the relaxation/imagery approach (such as extending the duration of breast-feeding or reducing parental stress after hospital discharge) and the physiologic basis for the increased volume of expressed milk (improved milk production v more efficient milk ejection) are appropriate topics for future research.\r"

Six patients had an HLA-matched sibling and underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Nine patients who lacked a suitable donor were given immunosuppressive therapy. Antithymocyte globulin was the initial treatment for eight of these nine patients. Two patients who failed to respond to antithymocyte globulin were then treated with cyclosporine A. Pretreatment age, hematologic measurements, duration of follow-up, and interval prior to therapy were similar between the two groups. All of the patients receiving bone marrow transplants had a complete response and now have normal blood cell counts. Six of nine patients (67%) responded to antithymocyte globulin and are now transfusion free, although three have mild thrombocytopenia. Both patients given cyclosporine A had a good response and are also transfusion free. Patients who underwent marrow transplantation had a significantly shorter period of transfusion dependence for RBCs (9 v 4 weeks, P less than .005) and platelets (5 v 21 weeks, P less than .05). The patients given immunosuppressive therapy have significantly lesser platelet counts in follow-up but have similar values for both hemoglobin and absolute granulocyte counts. Although HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation leads to a faster and more complete recovery for children with aplastic anemia, immunosuppressive therapy can provide a good outcome for children with this disorder.\r"

At the first visit, saliva samples (baseline) were collected, and each child looked at a videotape concerning the immune system and was tested with the Stanford Children's Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale. At the second visit, an initial saliva sample was collected prior to 30 minutes of self-hypnosis practice or conversation. At the conclusion of the experiment, a third saliva sample was obtained. Salivary IgA and IgG levels for all groups were stable from the first to the second sampling. Children in group B demonstrated a significant increase in IgA (P less than .01) during the experimental period. There were no significant changes in IgG. Stanford Children's Hypnotic Susceptibility Scale scores were stable across groups and did not relate to immunoglobulin changes.\r"

  ".W": "Multiple isozymes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) exist in mammalian cells. At least 5 major types of PDE isozymes have been identified; they differ by substrate affinity, maximal activity, intracellular regulation or mechanism of pharmacologic inhibition. A low Michaelis constant (Km) cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) PDE, whose activity is inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of cyclic guanosine monophosphate and stimulated by cAMP-mediated phosphorylation, is present in both cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle. This PDE isozyme (referred to as peak IIIc PDE) is sensitive to selective inhibition by amrinone, milrinone, imazodan, CI-930, piroximone, and numerous other PDE inhibitors. The subcellular distribution of cardiac PDE IIIc varies according to species; it is found in the soluble fraction of guinea pig myocardium, in the particulate fraction of canine myocardium, and in both fractions of primate (simian and human) myocardium. Another PDE isozyme, which is sensitive to inhibition by rolipram and is less sensitive to inhibition by PDE IIIc inhibitors, is found in cardiac muscle of some species (i.e., soluble fractions of rat and canine myocardium) and is apparently not related to direct regulation of positive inotropy. Both positive inotropy and vasorelaxation by milrinone and other PDE IIIc inhibitors can be linked to inhibition of PDE IIIc and activation of the cAMP system. These significant relations are similar to those obtained for other cAMP-related positive inotrope/vasodilators (such as beta-adrenoreceptor agonists). Moreover, an increased rate of ventricular relaxation (lusitropy), which is apparent with PDE IIIc inhibitors, may also be attributable to activation of the cAMP system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Evaluation of the impact of therapeutic interventions in congestive heart failure (CHF) with compounds such as the phosphodiesterase (PDE) III inhibitors must include the determination of regional blood flow and functional changes. Thus, whereas PDE III inhibitors produce a significant increase in cardiac output and reduction of systemic vascular resistance, it is necessary to understand their effects on the kidney and neurohormonal parameters. The evaluation of these effects must take into consideration both the baseline renal and neurohormonal abnormalities in CHF, and the cellular actions of PDE III inhibition, which include an increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate and cytosolic calcium. In a group of 13 patients with CHF, milrinone therapy for 1 month did not increase renal blood flow or glomerular filtration rate, or favorably affect neurohormonal parameters. However, forearm blood flow increased proportionately with cardiac output. Therefore PDE III inhibition produces a preferential increase in skeletal muscle blood flow, which may be a relative shunting of blood from the kidney. Alternatively, PDE III inhibition may activate renal cellular mechanisms that offset the anticipated favorable response to the increase of cardiac output produced by milrinone.\r"

  ".W": "Controlled and uncontrolled hemodynamic and clinical studies have noted that the long-term treatment of patients with chronic heart failure with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, such as amrinone, milrinone, enoximone and imazodan, may accelerate progression of the underlying disease and provoke serious ventricular arrhythmias. However, in an experimental model of chronic progressive left ventricular dysfunction, milrinone has been reported to reduce mortality to a degree comparable to that seen with the converting-enzyme inhibitors. These discordant observations suggest that either the deleterious hemodynamic and electrophysiologic effects of the PDE inhibitors are not translated into an adverse effect on mortality, or the animal model used to evaluate the effects of milrinone cannot be used to investigate the action of these drugs in human heart failure. Unfortunately, no trial has prospectively evaluated the effect of PDE inhibition on the survival of patients with heart failure. To address this need, the Prospective Randomized Milrinone Survival Evaluation (PROMISE Trial) has been launched in 75 to 90 clinical research centers in the United States and Canada. This study will enroll 750 patients with severe (class IV) heart failure, who have symptoms refractory to conventional therapy with digitalis, diuretics, converting-enzyme inhibitor and direct-acting vasodilators. Patients will be randomly assigned to additional treatment with either oral milrinone or placebo, and followed until death or to the conclusion of the study. The primary end point will be all-cause mortality, but the effect of milrinone on functional capacity will also be evaluated. The results of the study should define the place of PDE inhibitors in the treatment of chronic heart failure.\r"

The most extensively studied agents are milrinone and enoximone. Both drugs have clearly been shown in numerous studies to improve hemodynamics in patients with CHF when given acutely by either the intravenous or oral route. In long-term studies, milrinone has been shown to have sustained beneficial hemodynamic effects during active treatment. Effects on exercise tolerance have been less clear-cut in several uncontrolled trials, but a recent large-scale randomized trial does show sustained improvement in exercise performance. When milrinone is withdrawn after long-term therapy, some studies show worsened cardiac performance; the exact cause remains ill-defined, but could be due to deterioration of baseline ventricular function or to \"rebound.\" Both uncontrolled studies and a large recently reported randomized trial show that the hemodynamic response to readministration of milrinone after withdrawal is well-preserved, i.e., no tolerance is observed. Studies of enoximone show that its acute hemodynamic effects are similar to those of milrinone, but its long-term efficacy, using both hemodynamic and exercise end points, is less clear-cut, and no large-scale randomized trials of enoximone therapy have yet been reported. The studies of both these agents performed thus far indicate that the phosphodiesterase inhibitors have considerable promise for both acute and long-term treatment of patients with CHF.\r"

These agents are often referred to as PDE III inhibitors and share similar pharmacologic profiles. The principal interest in these agents--the therapy of congestive heart failure--is based on the cardiovascular effects that result from sequential elevation of intracellular cAMP, cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation, phosphorylation of cellular proteins and change in cellular function. The selective PDE III inhibitors have a triad of cardiovascular activities that provide hemodynamic benefit to patients with congestive heart failure. As a representative drug from this class of compounds, milrinone increases myocardial contractility, increases the rate of ventricular relaxation, and unloads the heart by way of a peripheral vasodilator action. The selective PDE III inhibitors offer a new modality for oral therapy of congestive heart failure.\r"

The degree of effort was evaluated by 3 criteria: (1) percentage of maximal predicted heart rate (less than or equal to 65, greater than 65 to 85, greater than 85%); (2) workload during exercise (less than or equal to 4, greater than 4 to 8, greater than 8 METs); and (3) duration of exercise (less than or equal to 3, greater than 3 to 6, greater than 6 minutes). The prevalence of defects on initial images was higher than both redistribution on delayed images and ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram (p less than 0.01). The overall prevalence of initial defects remained the same for all levels of effort and was not influenced by the presence or absence of a prior infarction. However, it decreased in patients with 1-vessel disease who exercised to higher workloads. The prevalence of redistribution on delayed thallium-201 images was higher than that of ST-segment depression on the electrocardiogram (p less than 0.01), except at higher levels of effort where they were similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

When the type of proarrhythmia and the type of ventricular arrhythmia were correlated, no proarrhythmic events occurred in patients with benign ventricular arrhythmia. Three of the 4 deaths due to proarrhythmia occurred in patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmia and 14 of the 15 serious proarrhythmic events occurred in patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia. The overall proarrhythmia incidence in lethal and potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias was not different (3.2 vs 3.7%, respectively). Proarrhythmia occurred in patients with more significant structural heart disease or conduction defects at baseline, but was not related to the baseline frequency of ventricular premature complexes. There was no relation between dose of moricizine and incidence of proarrhythmia. All 29 proarrhythmic events occurred within 10 days and 26 of 29 (90%) took place within 7 days of therapy start. Thus, moricizine has a low proarrhythmic potential, especially in patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias, and may have the best risk/benefit ratio among first-line drugs used in these patients.\r"

M-mode and pulsed Doppler echocardiograms were performed at baseline and at the end of monotherapy. Echocardiograms were read blindly by 2 independent observers. The patients who received placebo exhibited no change in blood pressure, cardiac dimensions or LV function. Diltiazem significantly reduced both systolic pressure (151 +/- 14 to 139 +/- 12 mm Hg) and diastolic pressure (101 +/- 4 to 90 +/- 7 mm Hg, both p less than 0.05). Posterior wall and septal wall thicknesses decreased, but the changes were not statistically significant. End-diastolic dimension was reduced by diltiazem from 53 +/- 5 to 51 +/- 5 mm (p less than 0.05). LV mass index decreased significantly with diltiazem by 10%, from 125 +/- 21 to 113 +/- 23 g/m2 (p less than 0.05). The LV wall thickness to radius ratio remained unchanged during both diltiazem and placebo treatments. Changes in LV mass index and blood pressure did not correlate, suggesting that this response is influenced by factors other than pressure reduction alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Histologically the differential diagnosis of EG in patients presenting with pneumothorax includes reactive eosinophilic pleuritis (REP), a nonspecific inflammatory reaction commonly observed in association with ruptured pleural blebs. The authors present a case in which both EG and REP were found in lung tissue from a patient with recurrent pneumothorax. Immunohistochemical stains for lysozyme and S-100 protein assisted in differentiating these two lesions. Histiocytic cells in areas of EG were S-100 positive and lysozyme negative, whereas mononuclear cells in areas of REP were S-100 negative and lysozyme positive. It is emphasized that the finding of REP and pleural blebs in lung tissue from patients presenting with pneumothorax does not exclude the diagnosis of EG.\r"

They found, regardless of specific antibodies used, definite enzyme activity in the tumor cells of these four patients. Although it was possible to determine that the tumor cells were epithelial in origin because of their intense staining with antibodies to epithelial cell antigens, control slides labeled with nonimmune mouse ascites also contained cells with definite enzyme activity. In two of these cases, unlabeled smears were stained for alkaline phosphatase and showed that the tumor cells contained endogenous levamisole-resistant enzyme activity. This endogenous enzyme activity is not demonstrable in either the benign cells of these cases or the benign or malignant cells of other control cases. The findings suggest that the immunoalkaline phosphatase methods also have their inherent endogenous enzymic problems. They also suggest that cytochemical demonstration of levamisole-resistant alkaline phosphatase may be a useful cell marker for the identification of tumor cells in serous effusions.\r"

Control specimens derived from normal autopsy hearts (n = 8) and autopsy hearts with severe coronary artery disease (n = 9) were analyzed in a similar fashion. The results were correlated with functional data obtained from cardiac catheterizations as well as the clinical history. The objectives of the study were to assess the sensitivity and specificity of immunoperoxidase identification of lymphocytes for the diagnosis of myocarditis and to correlate clinical parameters such as degree of cardiac dysfunction and symptom duration with the extent of inflammatory changes. No control biopsies (neither normal nor ischemic) had a T-cell concentration of one or more cells per high-power field (HPF:200X), whereas 32% of the study cases had more than one T-cell per HPF. Heavy T-cell infiltration (greater than or equal to 3 per HPF) was present in 7% of the study cases and occurred most commonly when the symptoms were of recent onset. The results demonstrate that lymphocytes are not present (less than 1 per HPF) in normal myocardium, in viable myocardium from hearts with generalized coronary artery disease, and in most endomyocardial biopsies (68%) from patients with unexplained heart failure or dysrhythmia. Thus, lymphocyte infiltration is not a nonspecific response to cardiac dysfunction. Immunoperoxidase identification of lymphocytes provides a quantitative assessment of inflammatory cell infiltration that is useful in the detection of myocarditis.\r"

Cryostat sections of tumors of various types and different degrees of differentiation and a panel of monoclonal antibodies to various molecular weight cytokeratins, vimentin, and leukocyte common antigen was used. The entire LAB procedure was completed in less than 7 minutes. For comparison, all tumors were also stained by the conventional avidin-biotin complex (ABC) method, which required more than one and a half hours for completion. The pattern and intensity of specific staining for the two procedures was identical, and the background staining was minimal with the LAB method. In view of the short time required to obtain specific staining, the quick LAB method may be of great value for characterization of primary or metastatic tumors in frozen-section diagnosis.\r"

Different fixative solutions were tested. Enzyme and immunocytochemical reactions were carried out in different orders of sequence to establish which was the better direction for the combination of the two methods. The following immunocytochemical methods were tested: three stages, avidin-biotin complex, peroxidase-antiperoxidase, alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase (APAAP) (using both peroxidase and alkaline phosphatase as labeling enzyme). Acetone or buffered formalin acetone gave the best results both for cytochemical and immunologic reactions. DAP IV and AcP reactivities could be visualized only when cytochemical reactions were performed before immunocytochemistry. CAE reactivity could be demonstrated either before or after immunocytochemistry. Cell surface antigens could be demonstrated with most immunocytochemical methods: however, the APAAP method was preferred for its sensitivity and effectiveness when combined with enzyme cytochemistry. By this approach, cells expressing only immunologic markers and cells expressing only cytochemical markers could easily be distinguished from those coexpressing both markers, because cytochemistry and immunocytochemistry could be combined without affecting the reactivity of each marker, and the reaction products did not hamper the interpretation of preparations.\r"

The accuracy of the D-dimer measurement in plasma using two latex tests and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was compared with that of usual determination of total fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDPs) in serum with respect to the presence of DVT. The three D-dimer tests were clearly superior to the FDP assay, but only the ELISA could accurately rule out the diagnosis of DVT with a predictive value of 100% when plasma D-dimer level was less than 200 micrograms/L. However, this test cannot be used for positive diagnosis (false positive rate of 69%). Thus, plasma D-dimer measurement with ELISA allows identification of patients in whom further investigation by means of more specific tests (venography or plethysmography) is indicated in order to establish the diagnosis of DVT. In contrast to this, sensitivity of the two latex tests studied was low (60 and 76%, respectively), which makes them unsuitable for emergency screening. In addition, the potential of D-dimer dosage for diagnosis of DVT in hospitalized patients is hampered by the presence of associated conditions that are responsible for elevated plasma levels in most cases.\r"

The latex agglutination test had a sensitivity of 89.4% and a specificity of 85.7%. Cultures of throat specimens obtained in the office had a sensitivity of 91.9% and a specificity of 91.7% when interpreted by investigator 1, and a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 95.1% when interpreted by investigator 2. There was no statistically significant difference between the numbers of false-negative results generated by the two procedures. We conclude that although somewhat less specific, the latex test is as sensitive as cultures of throat specimens in the office setting.\r"

There are various immunologic components that are deficient in the newborn and new methods to enhance their function. Defects in both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the neonatal phagocyte contribute substantially to the immaturity of neonates' immune systems. The neonate lacks an adequate number of granulocyte bone marrow progenitor cells, and has a decreased neutrophil storage pool and an increased tendency to peripheral neutropenia during neonatal sepsis. Additionally, the neonatal granulocyte demonstrates altered physiologic function compared with that found in the adult with respect to chemotaxis, phagocytosis, oxidative metabolism, and bacterial killing. Some recent clinical studies have suggested the benefit of using adult neutrophil transfusions as adjuvant treatment during neonatal bacterial sepsis, yet other studies have found the use of polymorphonuclear neutrophil leukocyte transfusions to be inconclusive. Reduced circulating immunoglobulins and impaired production of specific antibody have also led to recent trials in the use of prophylactic intravenous immunoglobulin in preterm infants predisposed to sepsis. Recently, hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors have been demonstrated to improve in vitro neonatal neutrophil physiologic activity. Future therapy of neonatal sepsis will depend on new nontoxic methods for enhancing neonatal host defense.\r"

Prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis was 35%, with more than two thirds of infected adolescents being asymptomatic. When compared with cell culture, the immunoassay was determined to have a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 98%, and positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 88%, respectively. Adolescents with false-negative immunoassay test results were more likely to lack evidence of cervical inflammation on examination and have lower-titer infections than their peers with positive results. When the immunoassay was matched against culture for test of cure after therapy, a 10% false-positive rate was found. We conclude that the immunoassay is a useful screening technique for detection of Chlamydia in high-risk adolescent populations; however, its limitations with respect to decreased sensitivity in asymptomatic girls and poor positive predictive value in the context of tests of cure must be appreciated.\r"

We hypothesized that nitrendipine would be efficacious in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly. We evaluated potential differences between nitrendipine and the commonly used drug hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was conducted as a double-blind randomized clinical trial of nitrendipine or HCTZ. Thirty hypertensive subjects over age 60 with a median sitting blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm of Hg were recruited into the study. A diastolic blood pressure with treatment of less than 95 mm Hg with a 5 mm Hg or greater decrease from baseline was considered a successful response. RESULTS: Nitrendipine decreased mean (+/- SEM) blood pressure from 163 +/- 3/102 +/- 1 to 142 +/- 2/89 +/- 2 mm Hg, and HCTZ decreased it from 164 +/- 4/102 +/- 1 to 143 +/- 5/91 +/- 2 mm Hg. A greater proportion of patients had a successful response with nitrendipine (81 percent) than with HCTZ (64 percent). The antihypertensive effect of nitrendipine twice daily appeared to be sustained for 24 hours. Blood pressure response to exercise was attenuated with both drugs. HCTZ caused gout, leg pains, muscle aches, hypokalemia, increased uric acid levels, and increased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Nitrendipine caused edema and tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Nitrendipine significantly reduces blood pressure with few side effects and no adverse metabolic effects, and offers a reasonable alternative for treating hypertension in the elderly.\r"

The sulfonylurea glipizide has been used to treat insulin-deficient states; however, its mechanism is not completely known. We hypothesized that glipizide would correct postoperative changes in glucose handling in a way that would allow more complete understanding of the drug's action. Two surgical groups (Group 1:80 percent proximal pancreatectomy; Group 2: proximal pancreatectomy plus splenocaval diversion) were compared with a healthy control group (Group 3). We have concluded that glipizide may have affected basal insulin sensitivity in the control group and Group 2 animals without affecting insulin secretion in response to oral or intravenous glucose stimulation. Glipizide does not correct the alterations in glucose handling or insulin secretion after reduction in beta-cell mass.\r"

  ".W": "The role of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) in stimulating hepatic bile flow was evaluated. Attention was directed at discerning the relative importance of the ability of CCK to stimulate the release from the pancreas of the choleretic hormones glucagon and insulin. Utilizing dogs with chronic biliary and gastric fistulas, duodenal infusion of a lipid emulsion resulted in an increase in cholecystokinin concentration and hepatic bile flow. Endogenous CCK stimulation was associated with a significant increase in the concentrations of both glucagon and insulin. In an effort to separate the potential choleretic response of CCK from that of glucagon and insulin, subsequent experiments were performed on anesthetized dogs that had the source of glucagon and insulin eliminated by pancreatectomy and gastrectomy. The duodenum and its arterial blood supply and venous drainage were carefully preserved, and intraduodenal infusion of emulsified lipid resulted in an exaggerated increase in systemic CCK concentrations. Although CCK release occurred in the absence of the pancreatic and gastric changes in bile flow, glucagon and insulin were eliminated. The results of this study indicate that intraduodenal lipid increases hepatic bile flow by glucagon- and insulin-mediated CCK stimulation. There is no evidence to support any direct choleretic activity of CCK.\r"

Four groups of ASA I-III patients (mean age 51 years, mean weight 72 kg) recovering from major abdominal or gynecological surgery (mean duration of surgery 141 minutes) performed under balanced anesthesia (midazolam, droperidol, fentanyl, N2O, enflurane) were randomly assigned to self-administer morphine-proglumide mixtures on the first postoperative day (ODAC; morphine demand dose 3 mg; infusion rate 0.36 mg/hr; lockout time 2 minutes; hourly maximum dose 15 mg/hr; proglumide doses per demand 0, 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms, or 50 mg). Morphine consumption, actual as well as retrospective pain scores (0-5) and side effects were evaluated. Mean duration of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in the subgroups was 17-19 hours, during which time 24.6 +/- 9.5 to 28.0 +/- 3.4 micrograms morphine.kg-1.hr-1 was given. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups either for drug consumption, pain scores, or side effects. It is therefore concluded that proglumide does not potentiate morphine analgesia in a clinical (postoperative) setting.\r"

Out of 25 patients who completed the 3-month treatment course, clinical improvement occurred in 19 (76%). Mercury strain gauge plethysmography in those 19 patients showed a statistically significant mean fall in the venous distensibility index, in maximum venous outflow and in the capillary filtration coefficient after the course of calcium dobesilate. The mean erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the 25 patients fell from 40 mm in 1 hour (Westergren) before treatment to 10 mm at the end of the course. In 42% of the patients there was a fall in serum globulin concentration and correction of the albumin/globulin ratio and in 35% there was a slight fall in serum fibrinogen concentration. Possibly calcium dobesilate's known action in lowering blood viscosity contributes to its beneficial effect in varicose veins.\r"

Sympathetic activity may influence plasma renin activity (PRA) by regulation of the conversion of IR to active renin (AR, PRA). It has been demonstrated previously that beta blockade lowers PRA at least partly through inhibition of this conversion process. The authors hypothesized that beta blockade and intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) would have opposing effects on production of AR from its inactive precursor. Eighteen primary hypertensives (12 male, 6 female, mean age 57.7 +/- 2.7) were entered in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study of the effects of equipotent doses of pindolol and propranolol on mean +/- SEM systolic BP, diastolic BP, heart rate, active renin (AR), total renin (TR), inactive renin (IR), and % AR/TR. Drug dose was titrated to achieve a goal DBP of 90 mmHg or less. Active renin was defined as the rate of generation of angiotensin I in 37 degrees C plasma at pH 5.7. Total renin was determined by preincubation of plasma aliquots with 1.5 mg/mL trypsin in the presence of 5 mM benzamadine for one hour at -4 degrees C prior to assay of renin activity. Inactive renin was calculated as TR minus AR. The BP responses achieve by dose titration of propranolol and pindolol were virtually identical at rest, indicating equivalent depressor effects of the two beta blockers. Heart rate and active renin were, however, lowered to a much greater extent with propranolol as compared with pindolol. The lack of significant pindolol-induced fall in % AR/TR suggests that this drug has little net effect on the formation of AR from IR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because of reported high misclassification rates of some of these rules and the known global difficulty of transporting prediction rules, four such rules (the Trauma Score, the CRAMS Scale, the Revised Trauma Score, and the Prehospital Index) and two newly derived rules were statistically analyzed using a cohort of 2,434 injured patients. All rules accurately predicted mortality with a minimum sensitivity and specificity of 85%. However, not one of the rules was able accurately to identify surviving patients who had sustained major injuries. In this instance, no rule was able to achieve a sensitivity of at least 70% while achieving a specificity of 70%. These results suggest that the problem with trauma prediction rules lies in the inherent limitations of the clinical data on which they are based. In view of this, the usefulness of existing prehospital trauma predictive rules must be questioned.\r"

We developed LYC and analyzed published LYC for obtaining chest films on patients considered at risk for pneumonia by means of logistic regression, receiver operating characteristics curve, and negative predictive value analyses. We were unable to derive or validate clinically useful LYC to improve on the seasoned clinician's probability estimate of pneumonia. We discuss the inherent limitations in the development and application of LYC that must be understood by those who seek to limit the ordering of chest films by the application of guidelines developed from decision rules.\r"

The remainder of the scalp adopted the upward follicular growth pattern of the posterior portion of the whorl, directed toward the apical anatomic axis. A ridge of hair over the nape of the neck reversed direction, similar to hair growth on the Rhodesian Ridgeback dog, growing in a downward manner. The relationship of this new hair pattern to current theories of scalp hair pattern development is reviewed.\r"

Although Miles' abdominoperineal resection still remains the \"gold standard\" for the treatment of low rectal neoplasms, restorative resection may now be possible with equivalent oncologic disease control and survival. Further, current trends also suggest that the abdominoperineal resection is being used less frequently in the treatment of most rectal cancers and is being replaced with sphincter-preserving techniques that afford excellent functional results. In this review, the pertinent anorectal anatomy, current issues, and sphincter-saving surgical techniques presently available for the treatment of distal cancers of the rectum are presented.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective, randomized, controlled trial was conducted to compare truncal vagotomy and drainage (TV), selective vagotomy and drainage (SV) and parietal cell vagotomy (PCV) as elective treatment for duodenal ulcer. Between 11 and 15 years after operation, 248 patients were available for study of the recurrent ulceration rate by a life table method, and 197 patients could be studied with regard to postvagotomy symptoms. The recurrent ulcer rates were 28.5% for TV, 37.4% for SV, and 39.3% for PCV. These differences were not statistically significant. The incidence of severe postvagotomy symptoms was as follows: dyspepsia, 18.4% for TV, 20.5% for SV, 8.6% for PCV; dumping, 5.9% for TV, 19.6% for SV, 2.2% for PCV; diarrhea, 9.8% for TV, 11.8% for SV, 4.4% for PCV. The incidence of severe dumping was significantly less frequent among the PCV patients than the SV group. The differences did not reach statistical significance in any of the other groups. There was no significant difference in the Visick gradings among the three groups either before or after treatment of the failures. About two thirds of the patients in each group were finally satisfied with their operation, often after second operations or prolonged medical treatment. It is concluded that none of the three forms of vagotomy can be recommended as the standard operative treatment of duodenal ulceration.\r"

Mean blood loss and hospital stay were highest in the portacaval group. Retransplants (two patients) and deaths (two patients) also were limited to this group. In this report, technical considerations, advantages, and disadvantages of the various shunt types are described. Management of patients with late stages of portal hypertension must include estimation of the effects of a portasystemic shunt on subsequent liver transplantation. It is concluded that portacaval shunts should be avoided in patients who may be considered for transplantation. Distal splenorenal shunts are best performed in younger patients with intractable variceal bleeding who are not expected to require transplantation in the near future. A mesocaval H-graft is the shunt of choice in patients who are current liver transplant candidates.\r"

  ".W": "The role of hepatic transplantation in patients with nonresectable liver or bile duct cancer remains a controversial issue. An analysis of 95 consecutive cases was undertaken to evaluate retrospectively the pathological tumor stage--in accordance with the TNM system--and outcome after transplantation. Included were patients with the following diagnoses: hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 52), cholangiocellular carcinoma (n = 10), hepatoblastoma (n = 2), hemangiosarcoma (n = 2), bile duct carcinoma (n = 20), and liver metastases from different primary tumors (n = 9). The overall actuarial survival rate at 5 years was 20.4%. Median survival improved significantly within the last 4 years as compared to the preceding era (18.06 vs. 4.0 months). Currently 27 patients are alive, with the longest follow-up more than 12 years. The incidences of residual or recurrent tumor were 27 and 28, respectively. Particularly in patients who underwent transplantation for hepatocellular or bile duct carcinoma without extra-hepatic tumor spread, the results were significantly better; median survival time achieved for these two groups were 120 (p less than 0.01) and 35 months (p less than 0.05). Prolonged survival without tumor recurrence was not seen in patients with cholangiocellular carcinoma or liver metastases. These results demonstrate clearly that liver transplantation for hepatobiliary malignancy is still justified on the premises of careful patient selection by adequate tumor staging.\r"

Twenty-four hours later, this procedure was repeated using a dose of 200 mg of clomipramine hydrochloride. Patients received no further medication over the next five days. The mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score for all patients, five days after pulse loading, had dropped by 35% (range, 13.3% to -82.4%). This improvement was significant, as was the amelioration in the Raskin Severity for Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory scores. Although the bioavailability of parenteral clomipramine was greater, there were no significant differences in either efficacy or side effects between the two groups. Pronounced early improvements in severe depressive symptoms may be achieved via loading dose regimens with clomipramine in the absence of continuous treatment.\r"

This article reviews both clinical and biologic predictors of treatment response and makes recommendations for future studies. The tricyclic antidepressants remain the drugs of choice in major depressive disorders. Lithium has a place in bipolar depressions. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors have a role in depressions accompanied by marked anxiety and/or panic symptoms, in patients who have previously responded to them, and as a second-choice treatment in those depressed patients who have not responded to tricyclic antidepressants. Electroconvulsive therapy or additional antipsychotic drugs are frequently necessary in very severe and delusional depressions. Biologic predictors of response, despite some interesting leads that may in the long term be of considerable importance, are not yet sufficiently established to be of routine clinical usefulness, although either dexamethasone nonsuppression or a shortened rapid eye movement latency may identify depressed patients who require biologic treatment.\r"

  ".W": "With increasing emphasis on application of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for an earlier detection of breast cancer, there is clearly a need for a method that requires only a small number of tumor cells for hormone receptor analysis. An immunocytochemical assay utilizing monoclonal antiestrophilin antibody and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for the detection of estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer tissues. To assess the usefulness of this technique in FNAB, 62 cases of primary, recurrent, and metastatic breast cancers were studied. The findings from the aspirated cells employing estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay (ER-ICA) were compared with results obtained from cell population of the same tumors following their removal using both cytochemical (ER-ICA) and biochemical (dextran-coated charcoal assay) methods for ER determination. Overall, there was a 92% concordance between biochemical and cytochemical results. This result suggests that anti-ER monoclonal antibody in immunocytochemical analysis is an effective tool in assessment of ER content in breast cancers. The technique can be easily performed at community hospitals and is well suited for specimens of insufficient size for biochemical assay. It may extend the scope of FNAB and make ER studies possible on material unsuitable for biochemical assay from sites other than breast.\r"

These groups were evaluated by routine histologic stains and immunocytochemical stains for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. Semiquantitative assessment of the degree of exocrine pancreatic atrophy and of two endocrine features (diffuse endocrine proliferation and ductoendocrine proliferation) was performed for each pancreas. Quantitative determination of the cell composition was carried out in three kinds of islets (parenchymal, sclerosis, and newly formed). The mean percentages of the insulin-producing B cells were significantly lower in the parenchymal (44.5%) and new (34.3%) islets of diabetic patients than in the controls (67.8%) and parenchymal (59.4%) islets of nondiabetic patients. The mean percentages of glucagon-producing A cells revealed significant increases in the parenchymal (43.0%) and new (55.7%) islets of diabetic patients as compared with the controls (24.3%) and parenchymal (32.2%) islets of nondiabetic patients. The mean percentage of somatostatin-producing D cells was significantly increased in the parenchymal islets (12.4%) of diabetic patients as compared with the parenchymal islets (8.2%) of nondiabetic patients and controls (7.5%). These findings correlate with clinical data of frequent DM in CP, but are partly in contrast with previous immunohistochemical analysis findings in CP.\r"

  ".W": "A prospective observational study of 229 cases was conducted in a busy ambulatory care setting to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and accuracy of spot urine urobilinogen and urine bilirubin assays as screening tests for serum liver function test (LFT) abnormalities. Both urine tests exhibited remarkably similar characteristics overall once they were adjusted to maximize accuracy and predictive values (occurring at a normal or abnormal \"threshold,\" respectively, of 3.4 or 5.07 mumol/d for urobilinogen and 0 or 1+ for urine bilirubin). The percentage of cases correctly identified were 81% to 83% for serum bilirubin assays, 68% to 72% for other LFTs, but only 62% to 63% for screens for cases with at least one abnormal LFT finding. Poor sensitivities (47% to 49%) limited the detection of abnormal findings by the screen; both screens were reasonably specific (79% to 89%), but negative predictive values were suitable (89%) for serum bilirubin results only and were prohibitively lower (49% to 50%) in predicting all patients without LFT abnormalities. We conclude that spot urine urobilinogen and urine bilirubin determinations, although good screens for isolated serum bilirubin elevations, have unacceptable statistical properties as predictors of other LFT results due to a high proportion of false-negative results.\r"

Research scientists and physicians in centers have contributed significantly to the new knowledge of normal and abnormal regulation of cell growth and differentiation and to the advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. The future for cancer centers is very bright. They will continue to play a major role in the advancement of knowledge about cancer. However, centers must be reevaluated at intervals to correct any deficiencies and to stimulate new and innovative approaches. Surgical oncologists should become more involved in cancer center research. Comprehensive cancer centers should develop more effective regional cancer control and prevention programs. Reevaluation of centers by the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md, and its advisory body, the National Cancer Advisory Board, along with cancer center leaders, should result in a consensus concerning changes to enhance their contribution to a solution to the cancer problem.\r"

  ".W": "In 1896, Joseph Francois Babinski first described his well-known sign of dorsiflexion of the big toe on stimulating the sole of the foot. However, unknown to Babinski, several painters had previously demonstrated this phenomenon in their paintings. Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510), a Florentine Renaissance painter, demonstrated this reflex in his Madonna and Child with Angels 400 years before the publication of Babinski's discovery. Botticelli used live infants as models for his paintings. Gentile da Fabriano (d 1427) in his Adoration of the Kings, demonstrates a similar response of toe extension in the infant Jesus when one of the Magi kisses the baby's foot. Similarly, Jacob Schick von Kempter, a 16th century German painter, in his Coronation of the Virgin demonstrates the extensor plantar response in the infant. Correggio (1492-1534), in northern Italy captured the extension and flare of the baby's toes in his Madonna and Child with Mary Magdalen. Raphael (1483-1520) presented the extensor plantar responses in the child when sole pressure is applied in Small Cowper Madonna. Leonardo da Vinci, with his nude model drawings (1503-1507) seemed to have been aware of this response. There is no indication that any of these artists fully understood the physiology behind the response; therefore, the value of this sign in neurologic disease must still rely on Babinski's demonstration several hundred years after its initial demonstration in artistic literature.\r"

Perimetric results were strongly affected by the level of experience in some subjects; in the majority, however, the effect of experience was small. Initial field tests often showed high numbers of depressed points. Sensitivity increased with perimetric training, particularly between the first sessions. Those subjects who improved most started low, gradually approaching normal levels with experience. Learning effects were more pronounced peripherally than paracentrally and \"untrained\" fields characteristically showed concentric contraction with numerous points with low sensitivity peripherally. An important practical conclusion is to allow repeated testing of all inexperienced patients in whom initial fields do not agree with clinical findings. A chart showing a concentrically narrowed field should be viewed with particular suspicion. Furthermore, a single initial field may constitute an inadequate baseline for clinical follow-up.\r"

In 49 of 56 normal healthy persons (88%), the levels were beneath the sensitivity of the assay (less than 30 pg/mL), while in the remaining seven healthy persons, the levels ranged from 33 to 163 pg/mL. On the other hand, nine of 11 patients (82%) with idiopathic aplastic anemia (AA), one patient with Fanconi's anemia, six of 12 patients (50%) with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), five of 12 patients (42%) with acute leukemia without any blast cells in the blood (M4: one, M5: one, L1: one, and L2: two), six of 18 patients (33%) with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), one of two patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), two of four patients with lung cancer, one patient with cyclic neutropenia, two of seven patients with malignant lymphoma, and four patients with acute infection had G-CSF levels ranging from 46 pg/mL to greater than 2,000 pg/mL. Interestingly, a reverse correlation between blood neutrophil count and serum G-CSF level was clearly demonstrated for aplastic anemia (r = -.8169, P less than .01). Moreover, it was found that the G-CSF level rose during the neutropenic phase of cyclic neutropenia and after chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in three patients with leukemia; also high G-CSF levels were positively correlated to blood neutrophil counts in some cases of infectious disorders and lung cancer. The cellular sources and the mechanisms for production and secretion of circulating G-CSF were not investigated in this study, but the data presented here strongly indicate that G-CSF plays an important role as a circulating neutrophilopoietin.\r"

Most of the information required for thrombin recognition and cleavage of the A alpha chain lies in the amino terminal 51 residue CNBr fragment. By selective modification of residues in this region, we probed the features that participate in thrombin interactions. We constructed a vector which expressed a tripartite protein (tribrid) consisting of amino acids 1 to 50 of the A alpha chain followed by 60 amino acids of chicken collagen and the beta-galactosidase protein from Escherichia coli. Cell lysates run on NaDodSO4-polyacrylamide gels contained the predicted band of molecular weight (mol wt) 125,000. The tribrid reacted with a monoclonal antibody, Mab-Y18, which recognizes the amino terminus of the A alpha chain. When cell lysates were incubated with thrombin, FPA was released. By including one heterogeneous oligonucleotide in the construction, we generated plasmids that encoded three specific amino acid substitutions. Surprisingly, changing Gly14 to Val did not alter thrombin cleavage, although recognition by Mab-Y18 was lost. Substitution of lie for Arg23 did not alter either thrombin cleavage or monoclonal recognition. Substitution of Leu for Arg 16 altered thrombin cleavage; unexpectedly, recognition by Mab-Y18 was not changed.\r"

These cells were previously collected by leukapheresis performed during hematologic recovery following cytotoxic drug-induced bone marrow aplasia. Seven patients were alive 9 to 17 months after HDC-TBI and graft. One died at day 40 from cerebral bleeding. All living patients achieved a 90% or greater reduction in tumor mass. In two cases, a complete remission (CR) has persisted at a follow-up of 15 and 16 months. Three patients have been well and off therapy with stable minimal residual disease (RD) since 10, 11, and 17 months, respectively. A patient in apparent CR and another with RD have relapsed 9 to 12 months posttreatment. Autologous blood-derived hematopoietic stem cells induced successful and sustained engraftment in all living patients. These results, although still preliminary, indicate that HDC and TBI, followed by blood stem cells autograft, which has both practical and theoretical interest over allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation, deserve consideration in selected patients with multiple myeloma.\r"

We found that approximately one half of these animals died of malignant lymphoma by the age of 16 months. Splenic enlargement was seen in all mice, but thymic involvement was unusual. One half of the CWD tumors were diffuse lymphoblastic or immunoblastic lymphomas while the remainder were large cell, small cell, or mixed cell lymphomas. Analysis of DNAs from 12 tumors for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements revealed that all six of the lymphoblastic and immunoblastic lymphomas were of T-cell origin, as was one tumor of small cleaved cells. Four of the others were clonal B-cell lymphomas and one was of uncertain lineage. Assays of a limited number of tumors for the expression of the Thy 1.2 and IgM molecules confirmed the diversity in the cellular phenotype. The results indicate that CWD mice develop primarily splenic lymphomas with an unusual degree of heterogeneity in the tumor cell phenotypes as compared with the thymic lymphomas found in other high leukemia strains. The CWD strain is a useful new model for studies of retroviral leukemogenesis and the relationship between the histopathology and immunophenotype of malignant lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of the X-chromosome genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) were studied in 34 female patients with primary myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Twelve patients (35%) were heterozygous at the HPRT or PGK loci for BamHI or BglI RFLPs, respectively. In eight patients showing PGK polymorphisms, clonality was determined by X-chromosome inactivation analysis. These included patients from different morphologic subtypes: four with refractory anemia (RA), two with RA and ring sideroblasts (RARS), one patient with RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), and one with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A monoclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation was observed in seven cases. In a further case characterized by bone marrow hypoplasia, peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes were polyclonal in origin. Following low-dose cytarabine therapy, reversion to polyclonal hematopoiesis was observed in a case of RAEB indicating the presence of residual normal hematopoietic stem cells with the capacity for marrow reconstitution. The clonal relation of lymphoid and granulocyte/monocyte lineages was studied directly in two cases of CMML exhibiting somatic mutations of N-ras or Ki-ras oncogenes. By selective oligonucleotide hybridization to ras gene sequences amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction, a mutated ras allele was demonstrated in PB granulocytes, monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes of both patients. We conclude that MDS arise from a multipotent hematopoietic stem cell with the potential for myeloid and lymphoid differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "Human neutrophils adherent to proteins derived from serum or plasma, or to the basement membrane protein laminin, underwent a delayed but massive respiratory burst in response to recombinant human CSF-GM or CSF-G. No such response was elicited from neutrophils in suspension. On a molar basis, CSF-GM (EC50 approximately 126 pmol/L) and CSF-G (EC50 approximately 585 pmol/L) were about as potent as TNF alpha and TNF beta in their elicitation of H2O2 release and orders of magnitude more potent than previously studied formylated peptides or C5a. CSF-GM and CSF-G prime suspended neutrophils for a respiratory burst in response to soluble agonists, such as formylated peptides. Compared to the CSF-primed respiratory burst of nonadherent neutrophils, the CSF-triggered response of adherent neutrophils is markedly more delayed in onset (73 to 95 minutes), prolonged in duration (150 to 180 minutes), and greater in extent (approximately 60 to 100 nmol H2O2 released/10(6) neutrophils). Neither CSF-M, interleukin-3 (IL-3), nor bacterial lipopolysaccharide triggered the respiratory burst in adherent neutrophils, nor did CSF-GM or CSF-G trigger a respiratory burst in adherent monocytes. Release of CSF-GM and CSF-G in response to antigens, bacterial products, or cytokines may give mononuclear cells control over the respiratory burst of noncirculating neutrophils during inflammatory and immune responses.\r"

Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from endotoxin-resistant C3H/HeJ mice were characterized for homogeneity in comparison with a cloned, growth factor-dependent macrophage cell line (S1) also derived from C3H/HeJ bone marrow cells. The mitogenic effects of each factor, alone and in combination, on the proliferation of both macrophage populations over a two-day culture period were studied. In contrast to CSF-1, TNF alone only slightly stimulated macrophage proliferation. However, the combination of CSF-1 and TNF stimulated proliferation of both primary BMM and S1 cells 1.5- to 2-fold greater than the sum of their predicted individual contributions. Such synergy was observed even at very high (plateau) levels of factors. TNF was found to transiently down-regulate CSF-1 receptor levels on both populations. Down-regulation was maximal at one hour; however, receptor numbers returned to initial, or greater, levels after 24 hours of incubation. Thus, TNF, an inducible monokine, greatly enhances the maximal mitogenic effects of CSF-1, an inducer of TNF production. These observations suggest an autocrine rule for TNF that involves synergy with (and perhaps obligatory cooperation with) CSF-1 in the regulation of macrophage proliferation.\r"

The treatment schedule included dose escalation from 15 micrograms/m2 to 150 micrograms/m2 administered by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion for seven to 14 days and was repeated after a two-week treatment-free interval. The blood leukocyte counts increased dose dependently by 130% to 1,800% in ten patients; a rise of monocytes and eosinophils occurred in seven and six patients, respectively. No sustained increase in reticulocytes or platelets was observed. Lymphocyte counts increased in all patients affecting both T-helper and T-suppressor cells; however, the lymphocytes were not activated as analyzed by the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor. In four of the patients, all with greater than 14% blast cells in the bone marrow, the percentage of bone marrow blast cells increased during treatment with rhGM-CSF. Cytogenetic data indicated induction of both proliferation and differentiation of the leukemic clones by rhGM-CSF. Toxic side effects were minor with slight fever, phlebitis at the infusion site, and bone pain in the minority of patients. In conclusion, rhGM-CSF effectively stimulates hematopoiesis in vivo in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. However, as the leukemic cell population can be stimulated in patients with a higher initial blast cell count, the combination of rhGM-CSF with other differentiation-inducing or cytotoxic agents has to be considered.\r"

Twenty-two patients (50%) entered complete remission within 6 months of the procedure and four other patients are free of disease progression. Only two patients have subsequently relapsed from complete remission (CR). Bone marrow suppression was the predictable major toxicity of this procedure, and two patients (4.5%) died of sepsis during the aplastic phase. High-dose therapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) appears to be an effective salvage regimen for patients with refractory Hodgkin's disease.\r"

One hundred sixty-eight eligible patients were treated with this intensive combination chemotherapy regimen. One hundred fifteen (68%) achieved complete remission. With the current median follow-up time of 34.5 months, the median durations of remission, relapse-free survival, and overall survival were 22.9, 20.9, and 17.7 months, respectively. Only 35% of the patients over 50 years of age achieved a complete remission. Age was a significant prognostic factor for complete response, survival, relapse-free survival, and remission duration. In addition, a low initial WBC count was found to have a statistically significant association with longer remission duration. Responders between the ages of 20 and 49 years with WBC counts of less than 15,000 appear to have an exceptionally good prognosis.\r"

G-CSF had no regulatory effect on Mo expression of cytoplasmic G-CSF mRNA levels and G-CSF protein secretion by itself.

  ".U": "89088563\r", 
  ".W": "Several previous studies suggested that murine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) might have impaired access to hematopoietic cells in the marrow. The apparent lack of hematopoietic responses to exogenous CSF and the finding of available or unoccupied CSF receptors despite saturating CSF levels in the serum led to studies of a potential blood-bone marrow barrier for this factor. Groups of mice were injected with pure unlabeled CSF-1 by either intravenous (IV) or intraperitoneal (IP) routes. Marrow and spleen cells were obtained at intervals after injection, held at 0 degree C, and assessed for changes in binding of 125I-CSF. Saturation of all available CSF receptors is achieved in vitro with 100 to 150 U CSF/mL. Despite achieving serum levels of 5,000 to 7,000 U/mL after IV injection of 25,000 units of CSF, less than 50% of the marrow receptors and less than 85% of the splenic receptors were saturated or downregulated. The decline in receptor availability was transient, with return of receptor sites in two to four hours. Increasing the IV dose to 125,000 units increased serum CSF values to approximately 20,000 U/mL and led to a virtual disappearance of available receptors for two to three hours. When administered IP, only approximately 40% of marrow and 80% of splenic receptors were affected for two hours. It was necessary to increase the dose of CSF to 250,000 units IP to saturate or downregulate receptors for three to four hours after injection. These observations indicate a marked blood-bone marrow barrier and lesser blood-spleen barrier for the transfer of serum CSF to responsive hematopoietic cells in vivo.\r"

The factors stimulated clonal growth of HTB-38 and CCL 187 in a capillary modification of the human tumor clonogenic assay in agar up to twofold. There were dose-response correlations over a range of 1 to 10,000 U/mL for rhIL-3, rhGM-CSF, and rhG-CSF. Incubation with neutralizing monoclonal antibodies abolished the stimulation of clonal growth by rhGM-CSF. The WiDr cell line was nonresponsive to rhIL-3 and rhGM-CSF. These results represent the first evidence that a variety of hematopoietic growth factors can stimulate the growth of clonogenic cells of some nonhematopoietic malignant cell lines in vitro.\r"

The immediate volume of distribution of 125I-labeled, recombinant erythropoietin approximated that of the plasma volume. Its plasma clearance was multiexponential, with an initial rapid distribution phase (t1/2 = 53 minutes) and a slower elimination phase (t1/2 = 180 minutes). Organ accumulation of labeled recombinant erythropoietin, as compared with 125I-labeled human albumin, was negligible until 30 minutes after injection when small amounts appeared in the kidneys and bone marrow. Only 24% of the 125I-labeled, desialylated recombinant erythropoietin was recovered immediately after injection, and 96% of the hormone was cleared from the plasma with a t1/2 of 2.0 minutes. The bulk of the desialylated hormone accumulated in the liver where it was rapidly catabolized and its breakdown products released back into the plasma. Significantly, in contrast to unmodified erythropoietin, there was also early accumulation of desialylated hormone in the kidneys, marrow, and spleen. Desialylated orosomucoid but not orosomucoid, yeast mannan, or dextran sulfate 500 inhibited the rapid plasma clearance and hepatic accumulation of desialylated erythropoietin. Oxidation of the desialylated hormone restored its plasma recovery and clearance to normal but rendered it biologically inactive, and accumulation in organs other than the kidney was negligible.\r"

Several of these glycoproteins have been characterized, and their amino acid sequences have been delineated. Modern DNA technology provides sufficient quantities of these hormones for testing in clinical trials. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to increase the hemoglobin level and hematocrit in patients with end-stage renal disease. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) can increase the numbers of neutrophils and monocytes, in a dose-dependent fashion. The function of granulocytes and monocytes is also enhanced. Clinical studies of the toxicity and activity of G-CSF and GM-CSF have been conducted in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and neutropenia due to cancer and chemotherapy. In almost all patients the neutrophil count increased within 24 hours after the start of treatment. Side effects of G-CSF and GM-CSF are infrequent and usually mild. Combinations of CSFs may be even more effective.\r"

Median followup is 7 years (range 1 month to 27 years). Local recurrence was only found if residual disease was left at the time of the original excision. Survival in those patients who presented without metastases was 77% at 2 years, 60% at 5 years, 38% at 10 years and 15% at 20 years (median 6 years). No survival advantage could be demonstrated for patients who received chemo and/or radiotherapy, although numbers are small and staging not uniform. An evaluation by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry cannot confirm recent claims that ASPS is a muscle tumor. ASPS is an unusual neoplasm; the primary therapeutic option is aggressive surgical excision. Survival even with the development of metastases can be long.\r"

Functional and phenotypic characteristics of fresh and recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-expanded TIL were evaluated. The expansion of TIL from hepatic tumors in the presence of 1000 units/ml of rIL-2 was possible in 60% of cases. In comparison to TIL from metastatic liver tumors, TIL obtained from primary liver tumors expanded faster and better in rIL-2 cultures. Expanded TIL from primary tumors had significantly higher cytotoxicity against K562 targets, but not Raji targets, than those from metastatic tumors. Cytotoxicity against fresh autologous tumor targets was detected in seven of eight cultures tested. TIL from primary tumors retained antitumor reactivity significantly longer in culture. The optimal in vitro cytotoxicity was achieved between days 20 and 60 of culture in the presence of rIL-2. Antitumor activity was associated with the increase in these TIL cultures of a cell population expressing the Leu19 antigen with or without the CD3 antigen. The frequency of the CD3+Leu19+ population showed a bimodal distribution during culture: the first peak of CD3+Leu19+ cells occurred between days 30 and 60 and was associated with the increased antitumor activity; the second peak occurred after day 60 and was not associated with activity. These findings demonstrate that TIL from most human hepatic tumors can be successfully isolated, cultured in rIL-2, and enriched in Leu19+ effectors. In addition, these TIL upon IL-2 activation in vitro are capable of lysing fresh autologous and/or allogeneic tumor targets.\r"

Of the total series, 112 were treated by the same surgeon and confirmed pathologically as having invasive mammary carcinoma. In this more homogeneous subgroup, the 10-year survival rates (and standard errors) were for RDL, 60% (+/- 7%) and for EXT, 74% (+/- 6%) (P value for comparison of survival curves = 0.13). In patients from this subgroup with central-medial tumors, comprising 62% of the total, survival after RDL at 10 years was 60% (+/- 8%), and after EXT 86% (+/- 6%) (P = 0.025). In the remaining patients with lateral tumors, survival rates were unaffected by treatment: 58% (+/- 13%) and 56% (+/- 11%), respectively (P = 0.62). Comparison of a nonrandomized series of 266 RDL and 124 EXT patients treated between 1960 and 1978 found differences consistent with those of the randomized study, although not statistically significant.\r"

Of this group of 503 patients, seven additional patients who did not experience a complete response survived more than five years. Of the ten patients surviving more than 5 years, two had immediate progression after institution of investigative regimens, whereas five remained stable for brief periods of time before progressive metastatic disease. Three patients experienced a complete response. It appeared that systemic therapeutic interventions in these trials were conspicuously ineffective for this large group of patients. A few long-term survivors attest to the capricious nature of this neoplasm and its association with likely spontaneous regressions. Although these long-term survivors did survive after institution of systemic chemotherapy, it is likely that this survival was related temporally, but perhaps not causally, to the institution of treatment.\r"

It has been suggested that lack of LFA-1 expression in lymphomas may represent a mechanism of escape from immunologic surveillance. We investigated the expression of LFA-1 in a series of more than 250 lymphoid neoplasms and reactive lymphoid proliferations using a frozen section immunoperoxidase technique. LFA-1 was expressed by all lymphoid populations in the reactive cases. In contrast, absence of LFA-1 alpha or beta chains was found in 44% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including 50% of B-cell lymphomas. These findings suggest that loss of LFA-1 expression may be of great use in the differential diagnosis of benign versus malignant lymphoproliferations. Eighty percent of initial biopsy specimens of low-grade lymphoma exhibited LFA-1 expression, whereas only 8% of recurrent specimens retained expression of both LFA-1 subunits. However, we found no correlation between LFA-1 expression and clinical course in a series of 64 patients with diffuse large cell lymphomas.\r"

A mass was surgically removed, and its histologic examination determined the diagnosis of giant lymph node hyperplasia (Castleman's disease). With removal of the hyperplastic lymph node, the clinical symptoms soon disappeared and the abnormal laboratory findings were markedly improved within 1 month: serum IgG levels decreased from 4350 mg/dl to 1829 mg/dl. Immunostaining on the lymph node sections revealed polyclonal B-lymphocyte and T-lymphocyte populations. The patient's lymph node cells were cultured without any mitogenic stimulation, and the culture supernatants were assayed for their B-cell differentiation factor (BCDF) activity to induce IgG production by our Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell line. The patient's lymph node cells produced high levels of BCDF activity: the supernatants could increase the IgG production from 140 ng/ml to 410 ng/ml when the values became from 140 ng/ml to 142 ng/ml or 148 ng/ml with those of the control lymph node cells. These results suggest that the hyperimmunoglobulinemia and its prompt improvement with removal of the hyperplastic lymph node may have been related to the spontaneous production of high levels of BCDF activity by the lymph node cells in the patient.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of fibronectin (FN), laminin (LAM), and collagen IV (Coll IV), three components of the basement membranes (BM), was investigated in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the surrounding uninvolved liver and was compared with the grade of differentiation of the tumor. The following three patterns of BM antigens were observed in HCC: (1) peritrabecular or periacinar, (2) pericellular, and (3) stromal-vascular. In the more differentiated tumors, FN, LAM, and Coll IV were observed in a peritrabecular or periacinar pattern whereas a pericellular pattern was only seen with anti-FN antisera that occasionally stained the content of acini. Double staining showed that the four antigens were usually codistributed. Occasionally, however, there was a different distribution along the BM suggesting an heterogeneity in the composition of BM. In the more anaplastic tumors and in the intrahepatic metastasis, BM components were seen around vessels and in the stroma and they were usually fragmented. The finding that FN can be located pericellularly or within acini supports the concept that FN is synthesized, at least in part, by hepatoma cells. The peritrabecular and periacinar location of Coll IV and LAM suggests a sinusoidal cell derivation of these two antigens. The immunohistochemical staining patterns for BM in HCC reflect the differentiation of the tumor, with differentiated tumors showing a relatively intact BM and poorly differentiated tumors showing a sharply defective BM.\r"

A review of the world literature yielded 34 cases of inverted papillomas in the upper urinary tract: 13 in the renal pelvis, and 21 in the ureter. Among these 34 cases, there were 26 male and five female patients, with gender not given for three others. Patients ranged in age from 19 to 89 years (mean, 64.1 years). Many cases lacked complete clinical details but, among the others, gross painless hematuria was the presenting symptom in seven; hematuria with flank pain or colic in six; and pain without hematuria in six. Only six patients lacked urinary tract symptoms, and three of these had microscopic hematuria. Only two patients had more than one inverted papilloma, and these were not multicentric. Adequate pathologic documentation and follow-up data were, unfortunately, absent in many of the cases. Although inverted papillomas are curable with surgical resection, with a low rate of local recurrence, they appear to be associated with synchronous or asynchronous carcinomas, especially other transitional cell tumors in the urinary tract.\r"

  ".W": "In 1904, Marchand recognized the consistent association of fatty degeneration and vessel stiffening and introduced the term \"atherosclerosis\" to indicate this combination. Current research is focused principally on the lipid component, but there is evidence that both aspects are reversible. Atheromatous lipids add significantly to the volume of lesions and thus contribute to vascular obstruction and end-organ damage. Reversal of atherosis has been observed in all the major species used in atherosclerosis research; rabbits, swine, dogs, chicks, pigeons, and subhuman primates. Direct evidence for reversal in humans is based on angiographic trials and is less extensive. One femoral artery and one coronary artery trial indicate that the lesions can be stabilized. CLAS, the largest angiographic trial to date, indicates that coronary lesion reversal is possible. Clinical effects of sclerosis are more subtle, and there is little evidence that sclerosis alone leads to end-organ damage. However, it should be noted that atherosclerotic lesions producing end-organ damage invariably have a major fibrous component. Sclerotic vessels have reduced systolic expansion and abnormally rapid pulse wave propagation, which can be measured noninvasively. Primate studies indicate that sclerosis is induced by hypercholesterolemic diets and is reversible when these diets are withdrawn. Changes in sclerosis may be another useful indicator of the formation and reversal of lesions and may involve changes in EDRF. Future studies of atherosclerosis reversal should use a combination of measures to evaluate both atherosis and sclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have had a life-long sustained elevation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Consequently, there is a need to maximally lower their elevated levels, and this usually requires lowering LDL levels more than 50%. Because no single hypolipidemic drug will consistently produce such degrees of lowering, combination drug therapy with two or even three agents is required to produce the desired degree of cholesterol lowering. A prospective trial was designed to determine if combination therapy using three hypolipidemic agents could effectively lower LDL levels in 17 severely affected FH subjects. Colestipol hydrochloride (10 g b.i.d.), probucol (500 mg b.i.d.), and lovastatin (20 or 40 mg b.i.d.) were given to each patient, in varying combinations, over a 25-month period. Lovastatin (40 mg/day) uniformly lowered LDL levels 36%. Probucol lowered LDL only 14% and in a variable manner. The combination of lovastatin and probucol lowered LDL no better than lovastatin alone. Lovastatin plus colestipol lowered LDL 52%; probucol added as a third agent produced no further lowering. Lovastatin (80 mg/day) plus colestipol lowered LDL 56%. Lovastatin increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 6%, whereas probucol decreased HDL 29%. In all patients there was an effective lowering of LDL levels, ranging from 40% to 70%. Thus, lovastatin plus colestipol is an effective hypolipidemic regimen for producing marked decreases in LDL levels in FH subjects. The addition of probucol as a third hypolipidemic agent adds little to the therapeutic regimen as measured by lowering of LDL levels.\r"

  ".W": "Arterial baroreflex control of the heart and peripheral circulation is markedly impaired in humans and animals with congestive heart failure. After reversal of heart failure in animal models, arterial baroreflex control of heart rate remains impaired for up to 8 months. Cardiac transplantation restores normal ventricular function and completely reverses heart failure, but does it normalize arterial baroreflex control of heart rate in humans? We studied baroreflex sensitivity in 11 patients with severe heart failure, six normal control patients, and 23 patients at 2 weeks to 4 years after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Baroreflex sensitivity was assessed with intravenous bolus injections of phenylephrine and is expressed as change in RR or PP interval (msec) per millimeters of mercury rise in systolic arterial pressure. Atrial rate of both donor (denervated) and recipient (innervated) atria were measured in the transplant group. Baroreflex sensitivity in patients with severe heart failure was 2.0 +/- 0.3 msec/mm Hg, but in patients after cardiac transplantation, it was 13.0 +/- 0.9 msec/mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The responses in the transplant group were similar to those observed in normal controls (10 +/- 1.2 msec/mm Hg, p = NS). Our data indicate that patients with severe congestive heart failure have marked abnormalities of baroreflex control, which are reversed as early as 2 weeks after cardiac transplantation. In view of this rapid reversal, we consider it unlikely that abnormal baroreflex sensitivity seen in heart failure is due to structural alterations in the baroreceptors. We speculate that neurohumoral rather than structural abnormalities account for depressed baroreflex sensitivity in heart failure.\r"

Sixty-four patients (18-55 years old; mean, 39 years) undergoing routine annual hemodynamic assessment were studied. Blood-flow velocity properties across the mitral, tricuspid, and aortic valves were analyzed from Doppler ultrasound recordings. Ten of these patients had elevated diastolic pressures associated with a sharp early diastolic dip followed by an exaggerated and abrupt rise in pressure, consistent with restrictive-constrictive ventricular physiology. Left ventricular dP/dt and stroke volume were lower in these patients compared with the other 54 patients. Doppler echocardiographic indexes of left ventricular filling and ejection in these 10 patients differed significantly. Isovolumic relaxation time and pressure half-time were shorter, peak early mitral and tricuspid flow velocities were higher, and mean aortic flow velocity and acceleration were lower. A higher rejection incidence was the only demonstrable clinical factor associated with impaired ventricular function. Doppler echocardiography may, therefore, noninvasively identify patients with hemodynamic evidence of restrictive-constrictive physiology. This abnormality occurs in approximately 15% of allograft recipients, is associated with impaired systolic performance, and may be related to rejection incidence.\r"

  ".W": "Beat-to-beat heart rate variability was studied by power spectral analysis in 17 orthotopic cardiac transplant patients. Heart rate power spectra were calculated from eighty-four 256-second recordings and compared with those taken from six normal subjects. The power spectra from the control subjects resolved into discrete peaks at 0.04-0.12 Hz and 0.2-0.3 Hz, whereas those of heart transplant recipients resembled broad-band noise without peaks. Log total power in the 0.02-1.0 Hz range was greater in the control subjects (0.982 +/- 0.084 [0.206], mean +/- SEM [SD]) than in the transplanted subjects (-0.766 +/- 0.059 [0.541]), (p less than 0.0001). Fifty-five electrocardiographic recordings from transplant patients were done within 48 hours of an endomyocardial biopsy. When the power spectra of those patients whose endomyocardial biopsies showed evidence of myocardial rejection were compared with those from patients who were found to be free of rejection, a significant difference was found in log total power (-0.602 +/- 0.090 [0.525] vs. -0.909 +/- 0.136 [0.577], p less than 0.02). We conclude that denervation of the heart significantly reduces heart rate variability and abolishes the discrete spectral peaks seen in untransplanted control subjects and that the development of allograft rejection may significantly increase heart rate variability.\r"

Using the proportional hazards model and adjusting for age, blood pressure, smoking, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, we analyzed this relation separately in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Mortality Follow-up Study (LRCF) and Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (CPPT), and Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT). In CPPT and MRFIT (both randomized trials in middle-age high-risk men), only the control groups were analyzed. A 1-mg/dl (0.026 mM) increment in HDLC was associated with a significant coronary heart disease risk decrement of 2% in men (FHS, CPPT, and MRFIT) and 3% in women (FHS). In LRCF, where only fatal outcomes were documented, a 1-mg/dl increment in HDLC was associated with significant 3.7% (men) and 4.7% (women) decrements in cardiovascular disease mortality rates. The 95% confidence intervals for these decrements in coronary heart and cardiovascular disease risk in the four studies overlapped considerably, and all contained the range 1.9-2.9%. HDLC levels were essentially unrelated to non-cardiovascular disease mortality. When differences in analytic methodology were eliminated, a consistent inverse relation of HDLC levels and coronary heart disease event rates was apparent in BRHS as well as in the four American studies.\r"

The femoral neck index (FNI) was measured and the Singh index (SI) determined. The number of trochanteric fractures has increased more than the number of cervical fractures during the past 30 years. There has been a shift during the last 30 years toward more dislocated cervical fractures. There has been no change in the distribution between stable and unstable trochanteric fractures. The FNI was significantly lower in the 1980s compared with the 1950s, both in men and women. In the 1980s, men and women with cervical fractures had a lower FNI compared with men and women with trochanteric fractures, even after age correction. The SI was significantly lower in the 1980s than in the 1950s, both in men and women, but the difference was significant in trochanteric fractures only. In the 1980s, trochanteric fractures had a lower SI compared with cervical fractures; this relationship was significant both in men and women. Our findings indicate that the bone mass, both cortical and trabecular, measured on roentgenograms of the hip, has diminished in the urban population during the past three decades. This could be one of many reasons for the increased incidence of hip fractures.\r"

Patients were recruited based on the presence of pharyngitis, no antibiotic therapy in the preceding 2 weeks, and a positive latex agglutination (LA) for group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) antigen on pharyngeal swab. Diagnosis was confirmed by positive GABHS culture on blood agar plates. Twenty-five of these children were also tested for GABHS antigen by enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA). After 18-24 hours of oral antibiotic therapy, only 10 patients had a positive test for GABHS on throat swab. Five of 29 subjects (17%) remained positive by blood agar plate (BAP) culture, eight of 29 (29%) by LA, and four of 23 (17%) by EIA. GABHS antigen was undetectable by LA or EIA in the urines of any of these patients, either prior to or after initiation of treatment, even in specimens concentration as high as 100 fold. Clinicians should routinely seek a history of prior antibiotic therapy in assessing pharyngitis. Neither of the kits tested are reasonably accurate for GABHS disease by detection of antigen in the pharynx after partial treatment or in the urine at any time.\r"

Concentrations of CsA and its metabolites were measured by HPLC. The dose-adjusted AUC (AUCSS tau) and 24-hour trough (C24trough) level of CsA and the metabolites increased significantly during the study period. However, there was no change in the AUCSS tau ratio of each of the metabolites to that of CsA, suggesting that CsA metabolism did not change. However, the factors that alter the binding and distribution of CsA (i.e., hematocrit, plasma proteins, and lipoproteins) showed a significant rise during the study period, and the rise correlated well with the observed changes in AUCSS tau and C24trough. Thus alterations in the distribution and binding of CsA and its metabolites in blood, rather than reduction in the metabolism of CsA, may explain changes in CsA pharmacokinetics over time.\r"

The new method of anastomosis tested here immediately after its completion is a sleeved continuous monolayer anastomosis with full-thickness proximal bowel joined to the mucosa and submucosa of distal bowel. The 3 to 5-mm sleeve of distal seromuscularis fashioned by prior excision of a ring of distal mucosa is folded over the monolayer anastomosis and tacked on to proximal seromuscularis by a second continuous suture. In this bench study, sleeved seromuscularis monolayer anastomoses were compared for immediate ability to withstand air distention with conventional all-layer continuous and interrupted monolayer anastomoses. The results, even in fresh nonliving bowel, suggest that there may be benefits from sleeving monolayer anastomoses in vivo. It is noted that in the newly fashioned anastomosis, through-the-suture leaks were common on progressive distention, but were observed at higher pressures in sleeved and in extramucosal suture lines than in full-thickness monolayers.\r"

Of these operations, 20 were considered to have been palliative, the remaining 53 being potentially curative. The incidence of local recurrence in the latter group was analyzed in relation to initial septic and anastomotic complications. The 53 patients were followed for a median of 36 months (range, 1 to 87); 24 were alive and well and 22 had died of disseminated cancer or unrelated causes. Seven patients died with local recurrent disease proved at laparotomy or autopsy after a median of 33 months (range, 3 to 72). Thirty anastomoses were stapled and 23 sutured; of the seven patients who died with local recurrent disease, six had stapled anastomoses (Fisher's exact probability F2 = 0.12; log rank chi-square = 3.53, 0.05 less than P less than 0.10). Two patients who died with locally recurrent disease had had clinically apparent anastomotic leaks and one other patient had had a radiologically demonstrated leak. This compares with a total of seven leaks (clinical or radiologic) in the remaining group of 46 patients with no recurrence (Fisher's exact probability F2 = 0.11). These results tend to support the hypothesis that anastomotic leaks may lead to locally recurrent disease, particularly after stapled anastomoses.\r"

Pancreatic specimens were obtained from 10 patients who were operated on for acute pancreatitis. Immunocytochemistry for pancreatic enzymes, keratin, actin, and carcinoembryonic antigen were combined with lectin-binding studies and ultrastructural investigations. Irrespective of clinical onset and duration of pancreatitis, tubular complexes situated in the vicinity of fat necrosis were observed in all patients. Intermediate forms of ductlike structures were characterized by widening of acinar lumina, decreased height of acinar cells, and large autophagic vacuoles. These structures bound all of the lectins employed and retained their immunoreactivity to secretory proteins. Typical tubular complexes were composed of low cuboidal or flattened cells surrounding a large acinar lumen. They revealed a loss for pancreatic enzymes, a reduced lectin-binding for L-fucose and N-acetylgalactosamine, and an increase for cytoskeletal proteins (keratin, actin). It is concluded that tubular complexes in human acute pancreatitis represent degenerating acinar cells which lost their secretory and membrane characteristics.\r"

The most common responsible agents are Candida and herpes simplex virus (HSV) with cytomegalovirus (CMV), Aspergillus, and other agents being regarded as unusual pathogens even in this unique population. Altered T-cell populations have been associated with CMV colitis in healthy homosexuals and in individuals with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Similarly, individuals with Epstein-Barr virus infections have altered T-cell populations. Whether these infections alter T-cell populations in infected individuals or the abnormalities in T-cell subpopulations occur first and enhance the likelihood of an infection in susceptible populations is as yet unknown. In this study peripheral blood T-cell populations in individuals before (19 patients) and after (47 patients) liver transplantation and after receiving a renal allograft (21 patients) were compared. Those individual having any symptoms related to esophageal disease underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy combined with mucosal biopsies, brushings, and cultures and were subdivided into those with and without infectious esophagitis. CMV esophagitis was found to be associated with an arithmetically decreased T-cell helper/suppressor (H/S) ratio principally due to an increase in the suppressor cell number. Such a reduction in the TH/S ratio and in the number of circulating suppressor cells was not found in esophagitis due to either HSV or Candida and was unrelated to the serum cyclosporine level or prednisone dosage prescribed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Except for a transient increased risk after IUD insertions, increased risk is seen mainly in case-control studies after 1973, the time of a major PID epidemic and adverse publicity related to the Dalkon Shield. Removal of oral contraceptive users from case-control studies generally reduces their reported odds ratios, frequently to borderline statistical significance for studies with high accuracy of PID diagnosis. The remaining elevated odds ratios likely relate to diagnostic bias as primary care clinicians are more likely to refer patients wearing an IUD to referral centers where case-control studies are conducted. Biased case-control studies provided evidence for expensive litigation, resulting in removal of IUDs from the American market. The Food and Drug Administration requirements for postmarketing surveillance are inadequate to provide prospective data to avoid this kind of loss.\r"

As an alternative, the authors compared the cumulative distribution of the percent of cells measured at increasing intervals of Vc and L, and observed a significant difference between patients and fertile men from the level of Vc30 through Vc70 micron/sec for curvilinear velocity and L2 through L6 for linearity (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, the authors coanalyzed these two parameters at the greatest point of difference (Vc40 and L3) and observed that their patient population can be differentiated into four subpopulations of subjects accordingly to their Vc40 and L3 values. In this study, 43 of the 53 patients had a motility disorder characterized by having a higher percent of cells being substantially slower and less directional than cells from normal men.

Nine fertile men with IHH treated with exogenous gonadotropins and 20 fertile normal men were studied.

While a small but significant difference in Vc was noted between the groups at the 40 micron/second cumulative distribution point (P less than 0.01), no difference in L was found between the two groups. When the men with IHH were subgrouped according to sperm density (greater than 20 x 10(6)/ml versus less than or equal to 20 x 10(6)/ml, no differences in Vc were found between the subsets, but for L sperm were somewhat less directional for the subgroup with a density less than or equal to 20 x 10(6)/ml (P = 0.05). Coanalysis using both Vc and L parameters indicated that sperm from IHH patients were distributed similarly to sperm from normal men.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the origin of the periovulatory changes of plasma beta-endorphin, trying to discriminate between a possible ovarian and/or pituitary origin. Daily plasma beta-endorphin, luteinizing hormone (LH), and cortisol levels were measured from the 8th to the 20th day of the menstrual cycle in healthy normal-cycling women (10 cases) before and during dexamethasone (DEX; 6 cases) or estroprogestinic treatment with monophasic (5 cases) or triphasic (5 cases) pill. In the control menstrual cycle, during the preovulatory days, a significant increase of plasma beta-endorphin was found. While oral contraceptives abolished the midcycle increase of plasma beta-endorphin, the periovulatory plasma beta-endorphin peak was present during DEX treatment. Plasma cortisol levels did not show any significant change throughout the control menstrual cycle, while they were significantly lowered by the DEX administration and significantly increased during estroprogestinic treatment. These results suggest that the increase of plasma beta-endorphin during the periovulatory days is related to the ovulatory function, and suggest a possible ovarian origin.\r"

  ".W": "From March 1984 to February 1987, 109 patients with otherwise normal infertility evaluations (semen analysis, postcoital test, endometrial biopsy, hysterosalpingogram and/or hysteroscopy, and laparoscopy) underwent serial ultrasound (US) for follicular dynamics. Twenty-five patients were found to have repetitive abnormal follicular growth and/or rupture patterns. These patients were treated by ovulation induction protocols from clomiphene citrate (CC) to human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG). Of the 84 normal US patients, 47 elected no interventional therapy (control A). Twenty elected empiric treatment with hMG/hMG-intrauterine insemination (IUI) (control B). Seventeen were lost to follow-up or elected in vitro procedures within 1 year of diagnosis. Viable fecundibility (fv) was calculated for each group. Long-term viable conception was compared between groups by chi-square-Yates coefficient. Nineteen of 25 patients treated for abnormal US conceived on treatment (fv = 0.25) (chi-square to control A P less than 0.005, chi-square to control B P less than 0.05). Six of 20 control B patients conceived during treatment (fv = 0.11). Two control B patients conceived in nontreatment cycles (fv = 0.016). When nontreated and treated cycles are considered, the fv = 0.042, not significantly different from control A (fv = 0.035). There was no increase in control B pregnancies over the course of the study compared with control A (chi-square = 0). The authors concluded: (1) Abnormal follicular dynamics on US is a correctable cause of infertility. (2) Empiric treatment of unexplained infertility patients with hMG/hMG-IUI does not appear to improve long-term conception rates; rather, it tends to advance pregnancies into the treatment cycles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The carbohydrate metabolism was evaluated using the oral glucose tolerance test before OC use and at the end of the 12th month. Both plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured. The fasting glucose value in the norethindrone-containing OC group (777) was significantly lower at the 1-year testing. All other values were unchanged. These data demonstrate that the triphasic oral contraceptive preparations currently in use have minimal effects on carbohydrate metabolism.\r"

Oviducts produce unique proteins that may be responsible for the success of GIFT. Unique proteins from human oviductal fluid (hOF) have been purified in the authors' laboratory. One of these proteins of 54 kDa molecular weight, and containing carbohydrate, was obtained in a highly purified state. In this study, human sperm were incubated with: (1) a mixture of hOF-specific proteins, and (2) the highly purified hOF glycoprotein, designated human oviductin I (hOV-I). Using indirect immunofluorescence, the authors studied the ability of hOF proteins to bind to human sperm. The mixture of hOF proteins appeared to bind to the surface of the entire sperm. Conversely, hOV-I binding was restricted to the head region only. Studies are in progress to discern the function of the sperm-binding interaction(s) with hOF proteins.\r"

Eighty-six percent of the donors died from head injury and 14% from asphyxia. No donors had a history of diabetes or pancreatitis, and the pancreas was grossly normal in all donors. Of the 47 cadaver pancreas donors in whom serum amylase levels were measured, the values of 20 donors were elevated (110-994 IU/L), and the values of 11 donors were greater than 300 IU/L. In 51 of 94 braindead cadaver pancreas donors in whom plasma glucose determinations were made, hyperglycemia was present (200-980 mg/dl). Early posttransplant pancreas-graft function was excellent in all recipients except for 5 patients in whom the grafts had to be removed for reasons not related to donor serum amylase and plasma glucose levels. Hyperamylasemia and hyperglycemia are probably not contraindications for cadaver pancreas organ donation unless overt pancreatic trauma, pancreatitis, or a history of diabetes is present.\r"

Since October 1984, a uniform immunosuppressive protocol has been used, antilymphocyte globulin, cyclosporin, azathioprine, and prednisone for induction and the last three drugs for maintaining antirejection therapy. During this period, 110 pancreas transplants were performed, 62 in nonuremic non-kidney transplants, 28 in recipients of a previous kidney, and 20 simultaneous with a kidney; 64 with bladder and 43 with enteric drainage; and 25 from related and 85 from cadaver donors. The overall patient survival rate at 1 yr was 91%, and there were no significant differences between the various categories. Graft survival rates, however, differed between the various categories created by combinations of the above variables. With bladder drainage, 1-yr function rates were 58% (n = 30), 47% (n = 15), and 77% (n = 19) in recipients of a pancreas transplant alone, a pancreas after a kidney, or a simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant; with enteric drainage, 1-yr function rates were 33% (n = 32) and 36% (n = 11) in the pancreas transplant alone and pancreas after kidney categories (enteric drainage was not done in double-transplant patients).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We have studied the effect of perfusing rat pancreases with anti-class II monoclonal antibody (MoAb), to remove class II- positive accessory cells from the intact organ, on prolongation of allograft survival after transplantation. The capacity of pancreatic islets obtained from these perfused organs to stimulate proliferation of allogeneic T-lymphocytes was studied in a mixed islet-lymphocyte culture (MILC). There was a significant prolongation in pancreas-allograft survival when intact pancreases were transplanted after a 3-h normothermic perfusion with MoAb reactive with class II antigens (16.2 +/- 3.6 days, n = 19) compared with control animals (11.0 +/- 1.4 days, n = 24). In vitro treatment of islets with MoAb and complement (CI) inhibited their stimulatory capacity in the MILC, as measured by [3H]thymidine uptake. Similarly, the stimulatory capacity of islets removed from perfused pancreases was also abrogated when MoAb was included in the perfusate. Although reduction in graft immunogenicity, by increasing allograft survival, was achieved by a 3-h pretreatment regimen, it was not sufficient to inhibit rejection altogether in our transplant model.\r"

The aim of this study was to assess the ability of antirejection therapy to reverse rejection when the diagnosis was based on either fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) or urinary amylase (UA). Sixteen dogs received a total-pancreas allograft with exocrine drainage into the bladder. Initially, a deliberately low dose of cyclosporin was given. Monitoring included percutaneous FNAB with ultrasound guidance and fasting spot measurements of UA. The diagnosis of rejection was made in alternate dogs when UA fell to less than 5000 IU/L (group A) or when the total corrected increment (TCI) of aspirated infiltrating cells was greater than 2.6 (group B). Antirejection therapy consisted of 10 mg.kg-1.day-1 i.v. methylprednisolone for 5 days and an increased dose of cyclosporin (25 mg.kg-1.day-1). The median allograft survival was 9 days (range 8-19) in group A and 32 days (range 10-63) in group B (P = .01). A fall in UA permitted the successful reversal of rejection in only one of six grafts, whereas five of seven grafts were successfully treated when rejection diagnosis was based on FNAB. In conclusion, early diagnosis of rejection was achieved by FNAB, improving the ability of antirejection therapy to reverse pancreas-allograft rejection and prolong survival.\r"

In an experimental study in dogs, the effects of sequentially conducted removal of the right pancreatic lobe (pancreatic head), duct obliteration, celiac denervation, and autotransplantation were studied according to a crossover design. Two groups of dogs were studied. In both groups the right lobe of the pancreas was removed at primary operation, and the duct of the transected left lobe (body and tail) was injected with fibrin sealant. The left lobe was completely freed from surrounding tissue (celiac denervation) in group 1 (n = 9), and the innervation of the left lobe was left intact in group 2 (n = 8). At 12 wk, two dogs in group 1 and four dogs in group 2 underwent successful autotransplantation of the left lobe. Pancreatic hormone secretion was stimulated by intravenous glucose injection and test-meal administration before primary operation and at 11 and 18 wk thereafter. The combination of removal of the right lobe and duct obliteration led to a decrease in glucose tolerance at both stimulation tests and a decrease in peripheral insulin release after intravenous glucose injection. At test-meal administration, no change in insulin and glucagon levels was demonstrated. If celiac denervation was added, similar results were obtained based on the understanding that the peripheral insulin release after the test meal was significantly elevated. Meal-stimulated pancreatic polypeptide response was abolished in both groups. Removal of the right lobe leads to parasympathic denervation of the left lobe, and celiac denervation mainly interferes with alpha-adrenergic innervation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In this article, the toxic effect of CsA on pancreatic islet cells and the preventive effect of K-MAP on CsA-associated islet cell toxicity were investigated. Prolonged hyperglycemia and depressed insulin secretion after the glucose challenge observed in CsA-treated rats could be prevented by the combined administration of 300 and 900 mg/kg K-MAP. Cytoplasmic vacuolizations and a decrease in the number of mitochondria, intact endoplasmic reticula, secretory granules, and insulin-positive cells, as revealed by peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining, could also be prevented by the administration of 900 mg/kg K-MAP. This preventive effect of K-MAP on CsA-associated islet cell toxicity may suggest the combined use of K-MAP with CsA in pancreas transplantation and treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes.\r"

It is known that the enzyme is very impure and that there are substantial variations in effectiveness between batches. Our studies suggest that one of the impurities of importance in islet isolation is a protease that has not been very well characterized. Comparison of two batches of enzyme, one of which was known to give good yields of islets and the other poor yields, showed that they had very similar activity against collagen (measured by digestion of insoluble collagen followed by assay of soluble products with ninhydrin) but substantially different activities against azocasein as measured by optical density increase (measured by release of dye). Eighteen batches of Collagenase were examined for efficiency in islet isolation, and the yields obtained correlated with manufacturer's data of activity against casein. The data show that low caseinase activity is associated with performance in islet isolation (r = .5 after adjusting for collagenase activity). The effect of supplementing a batch of collagenase, known to be poor in isolating islets, with proteolytic enzymes was investigated. Trypsin and papain had apparently no effect, but dispase significantly increased yield. Dispase alone failed to digest pancreas. Size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography identified a peak associated with high protease activity and efficiency in islet isolation, having an Mr of approximately 30,000, compared to 78,000 for collagenase. The protease, like collagenase, is inhibited by EDTA. Increased Ca2+ and Mg2+ (up to 10 mM) did not affect activity. Both the protease and collagenase are stable under normal use but are inactivated by heating at 56 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "More efficient methods of islet isolation must be developed for islet transplantation to become clinically routine. During collagenase dispersal of human pancreas, an amorphous, viscous, gellike material often develops and entraps large numbers of islets, thereby reducing the yield. When donor human pancreas is minced and treated with collagenase, the gel forms most abundantly if the digestion temperature is less than 35 degrees C and if pH falls below 7.2 +/- 0.2. Gel formation appears to be proportional to warm- or cold-ischemia time and may be related to tissue trauma during collection. Once gel has formed, trapped islets cannot be released by filtration, dilution, DNase, incubation temperature, or pH adjustment. These characteristics suggest that the material is gelatin derived from collagen released enzymatically from pancreatic stroma. We demonstrate that gelation is greatly reduced or eliminated when 1) the incubation medium includes glycerol--a common gelatin solvent--at 5% (vol/vol), 2) the minced tissue-to-total incubation volume ratio is greater than or equal to 1:10, 3) free-islet exposure to pancreatic digestion products is minimized by frequent separation of islets, and 4) collagenase concentration is optimized by titration. Gelation is also minimized by maintaining 5) incubation temperature at 38 +/- 1 degree C and 6) pH in the range 7.7-7.9. Variations in these physical and chemical conditions were analyzed by determining islet yields (stereoscopic microscope counts of serially diluted samples) and by insulin radioimmunoassay of acid alcohol extracts of isolated islets after separation through discontinuous Ficoll gradients. When isolation conditions are optimized as stated, we typically recover 3.3 +/- 1.0 x 10(4) islets/g pancreas, corresponding to greater than 10(6) islets per donor.\r"

In a few patients, segmental grafts from related donors were used (n = 3), and in a few other patients, whole-organ cadaveric grafts were used (n = 4). There were 9 retransplantations. Most pancreas transplantations were performed in uremic diabetic patients in combination with a kidney transplantation (n = 58). In a few patients the pancreas transplantation was performed after a kidney transplantation (n = 6). The remaining transplantations were in nonuremic diabetic patients who received only a pancreas (n = 25). Over the years, the results have improved considerably; in the 1986-1987 series the overall 1-yr patient survival (ps) and graft survival (gs) rates were 97 and 56%, respectively. The best results were achieved with the combined procedure (ps 100%, gs 77%); with pancreas only, the figures were inferior (ps 92%, gs 34%). Several factors explain the improved results. The incidence of graft thrombosis has been reduced by the use of anticoagulation, and posttransplantation pancreatitis has been reduced by avoiding ischemic injury to the graft. Cyclosporin has helped reduce the incidence of graft rejection, and monitoring of the exteriorized pancreatic juice has helped in the diagnosis of rejection.\r"

Intravital staining of islets with neutral red is a specific, nontoxic technique for labeling islets of various species.

The PARTEC cell sorter is an inexpensive alternative to currently available fluorescence-activated cell sorters and has a sorting mechanism based on a piezoelectric valve. We made extensive modifications to this machine to allow passage of particles up to 300 micron diam. Using rat pancreas stained intravitally with neutral red and dispersed by intraductal collagenase technique, we have shown that islets can be accurately identified in a high-speed flow system and sorted to a purity of greater than 90% islet tissue. The islets remain intact and viable as determined by supravital staining and isogeneic transplantation to the kidney capsule site. These studies prove the feasibility of separating intact islets by fluorescence-activated sorting.\r"

Fifteen human pancreases were processed, and after density-gradient centrifugation, a mean of 2643 islets/ml pancreatic digest were recovered with a mean purity of 63% and contained in 430 microliter mean vol. Viability of gradient-isolated islets was compared with that of non-density-gradient islets (handpicked) and showed no difference in function. This technique allows isolation of intact, viable human islets of Langerhans of sufficient purity for potential human transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "Because successful human islet transplantation requires large quantities of viable islets that must be separated from the highly immunogenic exocrine tissue and because handpicking is too time-consuming and laborious to be clinically relevant, a new approach for solving this problem has been established in rat models. It is based on the principle that magnetic microspheres (MMSs) coupled to lectins with binding specificity for the exocrine tissue portion are trapped in an electromagnetic field, thus providing effluent islets of a high degree of purity. In this study our aim was to adapt this principle to human islet preparations. In this context our prime interest was focused on a lectin suitable for human pancreatic tissue. Of 19 different lectins tested, only 1, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), is suitable, as shown by immunofluorescence, MMS-lectin binding, and magnetic separation.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro manipulation of pancreatic islets to decrease islet immunogenicity before transplantation has largely been directed at eliminating the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-positive passenger leukocytes from the islets. The mixed islet-lymphocyte coculture (MILC) system was used to quantitate the efficacy of immunodepletion of MHC class II-positive cells from pancreatic islets in terms of reducing immunogenicity. With these experiments we compared the in vitro immunogenicity of MHC class II-depleted islets with untreated islets. B10.BR (H-2k) islets were treated with anti-Iak alloserum followed by complement. This treatment successfully eliminated MHC class II-positive cells from the islets, as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence techniques. Depleted islets generated slightly lower amounts of allospecific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity when exposed to C57BL/6 (H-2b) splenocytes in the MILC than untreated control islets. Although the amount of CTL generated by the depleted islets was slightly less than that generated by untreated islets, there was significant stimulation of CTL by the MHC class II-depleted islets. Therefore, the presence or absence of MHC class II cells within the islet is unlikely to be the decisive factor contributing to islet immunogenicity.\r"

All recipients had insulin-dependent diabetes. The immunosuppressive protocol consisted of low doses of the steroids cyclosporin A and azathioprine. Mean follow-up was 16.5 mo for the enteric-diversion group and 13.5 mo for duct-obstructed groups. Two-year patient and pancreas- and kidney-graft actuarial survival rates were 92.9, 75.5, and 74.2%, respectively, in the former group and 92.3, 58.4, and 63.7%, respectively, in the latter group (NS). Five whole-organ grafts were lost (3 vascular thromboses, 1 pancreatitis, 1 rejection), and four segmental grafts were lost (2 vascular thromboses, 1 bleeding, 1 patient's death with functional graft). More surgical complications occurred in the recipients of whole-organ grafts and were often related to the intestinal anastomosis. A satisfactory blood glucose control was observed at 3 mo and 1 yr in both groups. Provocative tests showed higher and prompter insulin secretion in patients with whole-organ grafts. In patients with segmental grafts, the response was lower and delayed with a general tendency to impaired glucose tolerance. A marked hyperinsulinemia after meals was observed in whole-organ graft recipients. Slight nocturnal hyperinsulinemia was observed in both groups. At 1 yr, glycosylated hemoglobin was normal in both groups. The absence of a significant difference between the two groups, in terms of survival and graft function, and the lower surgical complication rate seen with segmental grafts have made us return to neoprene-injected segmental grafts.\r"

Pancreatic beta-cells express MHC class I antigen but not class II antigen. These experiments compared the in vitro immunogenicity of fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS-IV) pure beta-cells (MHC class I-positive cells only) relative to unpurified dispersed islet cells (MHC class I-positive cells and class II-positive cells). The results demonstrated the surprising finding that pure DBA/2J (H-2d) pancreatic beta-cells stimulated a strong cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response when exposed to C57BL/6 (H-2b) allosplenocytes in the MILC, similar to DBA/2J nonpurified dispersed islet cells. Furthermore, the stimulation of CTL by both purified beta-cells and nonpurified dispersed islet cells was blocked by addition of MHC-specific anti-class I monoclonal antibody directed against stimulator MHC antigen. The data imply that the highly immunogenic MHC class II-positive passenger leukocytes present in the islets were not necessary for the generation of the immune response in the presence of MHC class I-positive beta-cells. Although most of the pretreatment regimens attempting to decrease islet immunogenicity have been directed at eliminating the MHC class II-positive passenger leukocytes from the islets, this work suggests that modulation of MHC class I antigen may be an important approach.\r"

We have previously described a method for tissue culture of HFP that results in the in vitro development of isletlike cell clusters (ICCs) containing a minority of insulin-positive cells. Recently we found that nicotinamide, an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase, induces an increased islet cell DNA replication both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, this culture technique was used to evaluate the effects of addition of 10 mM nicotinamide on HFP explants cultured in RPMI-1640 medium plus 10% human serum. ICCs developed in 11 of 19 consecutive cultures with nicotinamide increased the yield of ICCs by 40%. Also, the insulin content of ICCs increased approximately 50% with nicotinamide supplementation, although measurements of DNA indicated an unchanged number of cells in each ICC. Neither the rates of insulin release in response to 16.7 mM glucose plus 5 mM theophylline nor the (pro)insulin or total protein biosynthesis rates were affected by nicotinamide addition. The combined results of this study suggest that nicotinamide is useful for stimulating the formation of ICCs from HFP.\r"

Rapid rewarming and 48 h of culture preceded repeat evaluation of recovery by islet counts, insulin extraction, and glucose-stimulated perifusion. Islet recovery was 94 +/- 4% by count and 90 +/- 22% by insulin extraction immediately after thawing. After an additional 48 h in culture, recovery was 74 +/- 12% by insulin extraction and 79% by quantitative perifusion culture. Perifusion demonstrated normal baseline and first-phase insulin secretion with decreased second-phase insulin secretion after cryopreservation. Insulin-stained sections and electron microscopy revealed preserved islet morphology and ultrastructure. Granulated islets with preserved morphology were recovered 14 days after renal subcapsular xenografting into nude mice. This study demonstrates high recovery and good functional activity of human islets after prolonged cryopreservation.\r"

A kidney was transplanted heterotopically in all cases. Mean age, duration of diabetes, retinopathy, neuropathy, mortality, infection rate, and immunosuppressive treatment did not differ significantly between the groups. Diabetic patients with only kidney transplants had difficulties adjusting to their diabetes, which may be partly due to the immunosuppressive treatment. The quality of life only marginally improved. In contrast, patients with a combined pancreas-kidney graft achieved full rehabilitation within a short time.\r"

Because whether this is caused by insufficient vascularization or graft rejection is unknown, angiogenesis and microvascularization of islet grafts were studied in vivo by means of intravital microscopy. After transplantation of syngeneic islets in hamster dorsal skin-fold chambers, 97% (n = 66) of the islets exhibited the first signs of angiogenesis at days 2-4, characterized by sinusoidal sacculations and capillary sprouts. After 10 days, angiogenesis was completed, consisting of a microvascular network similar to those of islets in situ: arterial supply, afferent and efferent capillary loops, and venular drainage. Functional density of microvessels was 700.1 +/- 127.0 cm-1, and erythrocyte velocity was 0.58 +/- 0.35 mm/s. Intracellular insulin was demonstrated immunohistochemically. Electron-microscopic studies revealed normal fine structure of the capillary wall. The model allows in vivo analysis of microvascular phenomena occurring in host-vs.-graft reaction after allogeneic and xenogeneic islet transplantation. Furthermore, it may be used to quantitatively assess immunosuppressive regimens.\r"

The degree of vascular ingrowth was visualized by in vivo fluorescence microscopy (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) and judged by a semiquantitative method from coded video recordings. The recipients of isografts were divided into four groups, depending on their daily immunosuppressive treatment: 1) none (controls), 2) 15 mg/kg cyclosporin A (CsA), 3) 0.4 mg/kg verapamil + 15 mg/kg CsA, and 4) 20-30 mg/kg methylprednisolone. In control animals, capillary ingrowth was first demonstrated on day 6, followed by progressive vascularization up to day 34. After 6 mo, the vascular architecture was similar to that seen in normal islets in situ. CsA alone significantly decreased vascular ingrowth on day 14 compared with controls (P less than .02). Verapamil prevented the detrimental effect of CsA (P less than .01), probably by improving renal subcapsular blood flow. Methylprednisolone did not affect revascularization compared with control animals at day 14. We conclude that CsA inhibits vascular ingrowth into transplanted pancreatic islets, which is likely to have clinical implications. The prevention of CsA vascular ingrowth inhibition by a calcium antagonist indicates a possible approach to the correction of this problem, particularly when the renal capsule is used as the recipient's transplant site.\r"

By varying the composition of the culture medium with different glucose concentrations and the addition to the culture medium of insulin, growth hormone (GH), amino acids, or nicotinamide, we estimated the formation of ICCs and their hormone content. High glucose content (28.0 mM) stimulated the formation of abundant ICCs that contained decreased amounts of insulin. In contrast, culture at a low (5.6-mM) glucose concentration increased the ICC insulin content but decreased the number of ICCs formed. Addition of seven times the normal amount of amino acids hampered both the formation of ICCs and their insulin content. Neither insulin nor GH supplementation of the medium influenced the ICC insulin content, but GH stimulated an abundant outgrowth of ICCs containing relatively high insulin concentrations. However, ICCs formed under these circumstances contained less than 10% of the insulin content of adult islets, and further work has to be carried out to identify factors responsible for further differentiation of the fetal porcine pancreas.\r"

Accordingly, a transplanted pancreas may be evaluated in the same way. By intravenous digital subtraction angiography and small amounts of contrast medium, arterial and venous structures can be visualized without catheterization of the arterial system. Five patients had combined kidney and pancreas transplantation. Intravenous angiography with 99mTc-pertechnetate was performed three times a week for the first 5 postoperative wk. Digital subtraction angiography with an intravenous bolus of 80 ml of a low-osmolar nonionic contrast medium (iopamidol) was performed late in the postoperative course or when severe impairment of pancreas-graft perfusion was discovered by radionuclide angiography. One patient had two episodes and three patients one episode of rejection of both kidney and pancreas. Impairment of the pancreas-graft perfusion always preceded or was associated with deterioration of the graft function. In all patients, digital subtraction angiography demonstrated the graft vessels in sufficient detail. No thrombotic complications were observed. We conclude that these two methods can be used for monitoring the kidney and pancreas-graft perfusion. The methods may be of great value, especially in the early postoperative period, when problems with organ function are frequent and early intervention is essential.\r"

In this study, the feasibility of this approach was tested in NIH minipigs transplanted with fetal pancreases. Collagenase-digested fetal pig pancreatic tissues survived in culture at 24 degrees C for 6-7 days and continued to grow in vitro at 37 degrees C after being transferred. These tissues no longer stimulated allogeneic lymphocytes in vitro, although some tissues cultured at 37 degrees C did. This allogeneic stimulation did not correlate to the number of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-positive cells in stimulator pancreatic cultures. When transplanted into an omentum pouch of normal, nonimmunosuppressed minipigs, fresh fetal pancreatic tissues were rejected within 14 days. Tissues cultured at 24 degrees C grew, and beta-cells proliferated in minipigs treated daily with cyclosporin A (CsA) and azathioprine. Twelve normal minipigs were transplanted with 24 degrees C-cultured fetal pancreases: 8 pigs received no treatment, 2 received 14 mg.kg-1.day-1 CsA for 14 days, and 2 received 6-7 intravenous injections of platelets prepared from pooled farm-pig blood before grafting. Strong lymphocytic infiltration was detected in all grafts removed between 30 and 90 days posttransplantation. However, beta-cells were found on day 45 in one of five minipig pancreas grafts incompatible at the MHC loci and on days 60-90 in all three grafts compatible at MHC but incompatible at minor histocompatibility loci. Short-term CsA treatment did not prolong survival of allografts from farm pigs into minipigs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To determine end-stage size of the graft and to evaluate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), these imaging techniques were applied in eight patients with well-functioning intraperitoneal prolamine-injected segmental-pancreas transplants for 79, 48, 35, 20, 19, 19, 18, and 10 mo. MRI was performed on a 1.5 Tesla system (Philips Gyroscan S15). T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired. CT (Siemens Somatom 2) was done before and after intravenous contrast agent. The graft was visualized in seven of eight patients with both techniques. Visualization with MRI (vs. CT) was considered excellent in 2 (vs. 1), good in 3 (vs. 6), and poor in 2 (vs. 0). The three grafts with function longer than 2 yr measured 3-4 cm in length; the remaining grafts measured 3-6 cm. Because of a marked decrease in size the transplants were no longer localized in Douglas' pouch but adjacent to or on top of the uterus or bladder, the position depending on the volume of these organs. The allografts exhibited an inhomogeneous structure with casual cystic degeneration visible with MRI due to a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. This study suggests that shrinkage of the duct-occluded pancreatic segment due to exocrine atrophy may be terminated after approximately 2 yr. It is concluded that thereafter an overshooting fibrosis causing late endocrine graft failure may not be anticipated.\r"

  ".W": "Since November 1975, 103 pancreas transplantations have been performed in 97 insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Pancreas and kidney were grafted simultaneously in 84 patients (plus 1 double retransplantation). Eighty-nine pancreas grafts were prepared by duct obstruction with neoprene, and 14 were pancreaticoduodenal grafts with enteric diversion in a Roux-en-Y loop. Five immunosuppressive protocols were subsequently used. With the latest protocols, patient and pancreas survival improved to 93 and 72% at 1 yr, respectively. The improvement in graft survival appeared to be particularly related to the reduction of the number of pancreas grafts lost in rejection. The patients treated with the last protocols, including cyclosporin A (CsA) and only low doses of steroids, showed a better glucose tolerance after provocative tests. Pancreas-graft function did not appear to be influenced by CsA treatment.\r"

We report a prospective follow-up (mean 26 mo) of metabolic control, neuropathy, retinopathy, and peripheral microcirculation in 31 patients with type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes (mean age 33 +/- 1 yr; mean duration of diabetes 21 +/- 1 yr) after combined kidney and segmental pancreas grafting. All patients had normal HbA1 levels. Glucose tolerance (GT), insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon were normal in 22 patients, and impaired oral GT with reduced insulin secretory capacity was seen in 9 patients. During follow-up, there was no deterioration of GT and insulin release. Vascular risk factors, e.g., hypertension, cholesterol, and triglycerides, decreased after grafting. Autonomic neuropathy improved clinically, and R-R variation increased significantly in 3 of 18 patients. Peripheral neuropathy improved clinically in 46% of patients and did not deteriorate in the others. Motor nerve conduction velocity increased greater than 20% in 8, less than 20% in 12, and was unchanged in 8 of 28 recipients. Most of the patients (n = 30) had pretransplant laser treatment of their advanced retinopathy. Posttransplant visual acuity improved at least more than one line in 56%, stabilized in 32%, and deteriorated in 12% of patients. Patients with functioning grafts for greater than 1 yr had no further deterioration of visual acuity. Vitreous hemorrhage frequency and severity dropped markedly from pretransplant (from 69 to 24%) 10 mo after grafting. Retinal morphology remained stable in all eyes except two.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The patients were treated with different immunosuppressive regimens over the years: steroids plus antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) plus azathioprine (Aza); cyclosporin A (CsA) plus ALG; steroids plus ALG plus Aza, replacing Aza 1 mo posttransplantation; or low doses of steroids plus CsA plus Aza. One-year kidney survival rates with the different regimens were 50, 42, 54, and 76%, respectively, in group 1 and 71, 74, 78, and 84%, respectively, in group 2. Patient survival was 60, 57, 71, and 86%, respectively, in group 1 and 93, 95, 94, and 96%, respectively, in group 2. Differences between the two groups were statistically significant for the first three protocols but not for the one used in this study. In group 1, 38 patients (55%) had a functioning kidney graft, whereas 15 (21%) lost their kidney to rejection. Between these two patient categories, there was no significant difference in age, sex, duration of diabetes, time on dialysis, blood transfusion number, HLA immunization, or HLA matching. Thus, since 1984, kidney-graft survival has not been inferior in diabetic patients. This improvement is mainly due to a decreased mortality related to better patient preparation and improvement in immunosuppression.\r"

All organs were perfused with Eurocollins solution and stored at 4 degrees C. Fasting blood glucose levels and total amount of pancreatic juice produced over the first 3 postoperative days were recorded to assess graft function. No statistically significant difference was found between groups 1 and 2 and between groups 3 and 4. From these data, it is concluded that with the preservation method used, CIT can without a doubt be extended to at least 12 h, and a maximum donor age similar to that for the kidney can be adopted. This might not only enlarge the donor pool but also facilitate distant organ procurement.\r"

The number of sickness pensions paid increased from 28% of the patients pretransplantation to 42% in October 1987 in group 1 and from 20 to 62% in group 2. Over the last 2 yr, an average of 12 days of hospitalization were necessitated in group 1 compared to 25 days in group 2. When physical activity was evaluated, both groups judged their present state of health as good or very good (group 1, 78%; group 2, 73%). In group 1, 80% claimed they had recovered the same or better quality of life as they had before renal failure, compared to 50% in group 2. The investigation showed that group 1 seemed to achieve a better quality of life than group 2; all combined pancreas-kidney-transplant patients returned to a normal diet and achieved a less restricted life-style.\r"

  ".W": "Four successful cases of pregnancy after combined pancreas-kidney transplantation at four different centers are summarized. The techniques used for the pancreas transplantations were duct obstruction in one patient and enteric exocrine diversion in two patients; in all three patients the insulin delivery was to the systemic circulation. In one patient exocrine diversion was to the stomach and the vascular anastomosis to the splenic vessels, thus accomplishing portal insulin delivery. Immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporin and prednisolone in two patients; cyclosporin alone in one patient; and cyclosporin, azathioprine, and prednisolone in one patient. In all a cesarean section was performed, due to deteriorating renal function in two patients, a fall in fetal growth in one patient, and fear of inducing pancreas-graft pancreatitis during normal delivery in one patient. In all four women, perfect metabolic control was retained throughout the pregnancy, and despite the proximity of the pancreas graft to the growing uterus in three of the women, the pancreas grafts did not suffer any damage during the pregnancy. However, in one patient the pancreas graft was lost in acute rejection after delivery. This pancreas had functioned normally for 3 yr before this occasion. Of the offspring, one was completely normal, one had a bilateral cataract, and two were small for date. The latter two subsequently showed normal growth development. At follow-up at 3, 5, 7, and 28 mo, all kidney grafts and three of the pancreas grafts remained functional. We conclude that after combined pancreas-kidney transplantation, successful conception and pregnancy can be obtained. Despite reduced islet mass (segmental grafts), normal metabolic control can be retained throughout the pregnancy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

We studied the possibility that serum PASP levels reflect pancreas-graft rejections in human pancreas-transplant recipients. Ten patients subjected to combined pancreas-kidney transplantation and 4 patients subjected to pancreas transplantation alone were studied. Twelve kidney recipients served as control subjects. On several occasions, PASP levels were elevated at kidney rejections in patients with combined pancreas-kidney grafts and then decreased after antirejection therapy, although no other indications for concomitant pancreas-graft rejection were at hand. In the recipients of pancreas grafts alone, PASP levels increased before or at the same time as graft rejections were indicated by current methods. In two cases of chronic graft rejection, PASP rose to high levels long before hyperglycemia occurred. In the control group of kidney-graft recipients, PASP levels were stable and were not affected by high serum creatinine levels, kidney-rejection episodes, or antirejection therapy. This study indicates that PASP may be a good serum marker for pancreas-graft rejection.\r"

Twelve patients (80%) had a total of 18 rejection episodes. In the first 11 patients, 13 rejection episodes were diagnosed by a decline in amylase activity in the pancreatic juice, whereas in the next 4 patients, 5 rejection episodes were diagnosed by positive cytology in the pancreatic juice. Neopterin in pancreatic juice and immunoreactive anionic trypsin in serum showed promise as rejection markers, whereas serum neopterin, serum amylase, and serum immunoreactive cationic trypsin did not. Unspecific signs of rejections were an increase in white blood cell count, clinical symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, and arthralgia. All acute rejection episodes were successfully reversed by antirejection treatment. However, late rejections diagnosed by impaired endocrine function were seen in 6 of the 15 (40%) patients, and the prognoses for these rejections were worse: 4 patients (27%) lost their grafts because of chronic rejections, and 2 patients still had impaired endocrine function.\r"

  ".W": "A major dilemma in pancreas transplantation is the lack of reliable methods for the early detection of allograft rejection. Over a 26-mo period, 70 rejection episodes occurred in 36 patients (13 isolated-pancreas, 23 simultaneous pancreas-kidney recipients) with pancreaticoduodenocystostomy. A total of 300 radionuclide pancreas examinations were performed (mean 8.3/patient) utilizing 99mTc-labeled DTPA. Computer analysis generated a quantitative measure of blood flow to the allograft (technetium index, TI). Rejection episodes were defined as isolated pancreas, isolated kidney, or combined pancreas-kidney. Mean urinary amylase (UA) levels and TI during normal allograft function were 30,256 U/L and 0.57%, respectively, whereas levels heralding rejection were 6873 U/L and 0.39% (P less than .05). The treatment of rejection based on kidney dysfunction or combined pancreas-kidney dysfunction resulted in significantly higher graft salvage and a lower incidence of hyperglycemia compared with isolated-pancreas-allograft rejection. After therapy, a TI greater than 0.3% was associated with 95.9% graft survival, whereas levels less than 0.3% resulted in a 72.7% rate of graft loss (P less than .001). Similarly, pancreas allografts with a UA greater than 10,000 U/L had 92.2% functional survival, whereas levels less than 10,000 U/L resulted in a 53.3% rate of graft loss (P less than 0.001). Overall, reversal of rejection occurred in 80% of cases, with 10 pancreas and 2 kidney allografts lost due to rejection. Monitoring pancreas-allograft function by UA, TI, and renal function in simultaneous transplants allows for the timely diagnosis and successful treatment of pancreas-allograft rejection.\r"

In those cases, an early diagnosis is often difficult, and a method for home UAA monitoring is needed. We have developed a method that can be used for this purpose. The method, based on Kodak dry-film technology, is shown to have good response to the wide range of UAA seen in these patients compared with responses to standard laboratory kinetic methods. The analysis (performed by the patient) involves 1) collecting urine for 24 h in a 4-L container, 2) diluting the urine with tap water to a total urine of 4 L, and 3) placing a drop of this dilution onto a slide. The slide is read by a handheld spectrophotometer that displays the UAA in secreted units per hour. The reliability of this system has been tested for wide changes of urine pH, volume of the drop applied to the slide, and tap water from different sources. Temperature coefficients have been determined to correct changes in ambient temperatures. The final handheld prototype is being developed based on these preliminary studies. This device could be of benefit for the early diagnosis of rejection episodes in recipients of bladder-drained pancreas grafts after hospital discharge.\r"

In situ cooling of the donor pancreas was performed with 1000 ml of UW solution followed by ex vivo perfusion with an additional 250-500 ml. Graft preservation times ranged from 3 to 19 h (mean 10.2 h). Pancreas transplants were vascularized whole-organ grafts with pancreaticoduodenocystostomy. Early graft function was excellent as assessed by immediate insulin independence, high urinary amylase and low serum amylase levels, and a technetium perfusion index indicating good pancreatic blood flow. There were no episodes of primary nonfunction, graft pancreatitis, or vascular thrombosis. Actuarial patient and graft survival at 1 mo was 92.9%. We conclude that UW solution provides excellent early graft function for up to 19 h of cold storage. Based on previously reported data on its efficacy in liver and kidney preservation, UW solution seems ideally suited as a universal intra-aortic flush and cold-storage solution.\r"

During a 26-mo period, 46 vascularized pancreas transplants were performed with pancreaticoduodenocystostomy. Twenty-one patients (45.7%) were treated with OKT3. Indications for OKT3 use included steroid- and/or antilymphoblast globulin-resistant rejection in isolated-pancreas transplant (n = 8) or simultaneous pancreas-kidney-transplant (n = 13) recipients. A total of 46 rejection episodes occurred (mean 2.2). OKT3 was administered for a 14-day course concomitant with pulsed corticosteroids, azathioprine, and cyclosporin. OKT3 rescue therapy was successful in 13 cases (61.9%). The mean time to rejection reversal was 8.8 days (range 5-14 days). In isolated-pancreas transplants, OKT3 reversed only 1 episode of rejection (12.5%). In contrast, 12 episodes (92.3%) of allograft rejection were responsive to OKT3 in simultaneous pancreas-kidney recipients (P less than .05). Graft loss from rejection occurred at a mean 5.5 mo posttransplantation. OKT3 therapy was more successful in the setting of early rejection, rejection in combined pancreas-kidney transplants, and rejection not associated with hyperglycemia. No graft loss due to infection or patient death has occurred after OKT3 therapy. After a mean follow-up of 17.3 mo, patient survival was 89.1%, and allograft survival was 26.3% in isolated-pancreas and 85.2% in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants (P less than .05). Salvage therapy with OKT3 is a safe and effective means of reversing rejection in pancreas-allograft recipients. OKT3 is more effective in simultaneous pancreas-kidney recipients due to the earlier diagnosis of rejection.\r"

  ".W": "On the basis of 26 combined pancreas-kidney transplants we questioned whether both organs undergo rejection simultaneously. Reliable diagnosis of pancreas-graft rejection was made possible by monitoring exocrine graft function, including quantitative measurements of pancreatic juice, its amylase content, and pancreatic juice cytology. In addition, diagnosis of pancreas rejection was based on regular flow studies, daily urinary neopterin excretion, and a retrospective analysis of the clinical course. Clinical symptoms, blood chemistry, and, primarily, histology were used to assess rejection of the kidney allograft. In 18 cases the kidney and pancreas were rejected together; in 8 cases the kidney or the pancreas was rejected. Although both organs were rejected at the same time in most cases, either organ can be rejected alone. Thus, the kidney cannot be used to monitor the pancreas allograft in every case.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate a possible reenhancement of islet cell autoimmunity in type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients who received HLA-mismatched pancreas transplants from cadaveric donors and who underwent generalized immunosuppression. Circulating islet cell antibodies (ICA) and complement-fixing ICAs (CF-ICAs) have been tested at 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 mo and at least once a year posttransplantation in 23 recipients of 25 transplants (22 simultaneous with kidney, 2 retransplants, 1 isolated; 23 segmental neoprene injected, 2 whole with enteric drainage). Patients were aged 35.3 +/- 1.9 yr with a duration of diabetes of 20.6 +/- 1.1 yr. Immunosuppression consisted of double or triple association of azathioprine, cyclosporin, and prednisone with or without temporary antilymphocyte globulins. The number of HLA-A and HLA-B compatibilities was none in 8 patients, one in 12 patients, two in 4 patients, and three in 1 patient. The mean follow-up was 4.0 +/- 0.4 yr/patient (range 0.4-7.2). ICAs were positive pretransplantation in 2 of 25 patients and reappeared 1-42 mo posttransplantation in another 7. In 6 patients, CF-ICAs were also positive. In 7 of 9 ICA+ patients the pancreas transplant failed; in 1 patient this occurred 4 mo before ICA reappearance, and in 6 patients it occurred 2-35 mo after the first detection of ICAs. Pancreas-transplant failure was significantly associated with the positivity for ICAs (P less than .05) and particularly for CF-ICAs (P less than .005). ICA positivity was transitory in 4 patients (2-27 mo) and persistent in the remaining 5 (up to 61 mo).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In a series of 200 pancreas transplants with 6 mo to less than 9 yr of follow-up, recurrence of disease was identified as the cause of graft failure in 8 cases, all in non- or minimally immunosuppressed recipients of transplants from identical twin (n = 3) or HLA-identical sibling (n = 5) donors. Recurrence of disease was defined as selective loss of beta-cells; other endocrine cell types persisted and appeared normal within the islets of the graft. Isletitis was present in islets with residual beta-cells during the evolution of the process in all nonimmunosuppressed and in some immunosuppressed recipients, but isletitis resolved in all cases in which beta-cell destruction was complete and also resolved in some cases in which residual beta-cells were retained after the introduction of or an increase in immunosuppression. Recurrence of disease can be prevented by immunosuppression, and 2 recipients of identical twin grafts and 12 recipients of grafts from HLA-identical siblings had functioning grafts as of March 1988, the longest greater than 7 yr. The process has not been observed in patients in whom full-dose immunosuppression has been used, including HLA-identical siblings, and this may be the reason no cases of recurrence of disease have been identified in recipients of cadaveric grafts. Alternatively, the observations are consistent with, but not proof of, the hypothesis that recurrence of disease (autoimmune isletitis leading to diabetes) is a major histocompatibility complex-restricted phenomenon.\r"

The groups were matched for body mass and current dose and type of immunosuppressive treatment. The serum creatinine levels did not differ between the two study groups, but the serum urea level in the nondiabetic patients was slightly but significantly higher than in the diabetic patients. In the pancreas-kidney-transplanted group the investigation was performed 8-47 mo posttransplantation; in the kidney-transplanted nondiabetic patients, 12-18 mo posttransplantation. The mean 24-h levels and rhythms of blood glucose, free fatty acid, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and alanine did not differ between the groups. The mean 24-h levels of blood lactate and glycerol were moderately but significantly higher in the pancreas-kidney-transplanted diabetic patients. At fasting, the level of serum immunoreactive insulin was more than twice as high in the pancreas-kidney-transplanted patients, whereas the plasma C-peptide levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. The meal-induced increases in serum insulin as well as in the plasma C-peptide levels were more marked in the pancreas-kidney-transplanted patients. The findings suggest that the hyperinsulinemia in these patients was due to both the systemic delivery of insulin and an increase in insulin resistance, the latter being particularly apparent in the postprandial phase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The mean age of the patients was somewhat higher in the Oslo series.

The principles of the technique are to digest the lamina propria from the epithelium with Dispase and collagenase, to disrupt the epithelium by trituration, and to purify the epithelial cells by seiving and differential sedimentation. Whole and partial crypts were isolated with consistently high purity of 93.5% +/- 1.2% (excluding red cells). Structural integrity was confirmed by light and electron microscopy, exclusion of trypan blue, minimal leakage of lactic dehydrogenase over 5 h (4.1% +/- 1.7%), and 51Cr leakage of less than 2% per hour over 16 h. Functional integrity was supported by continued deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis [( 3H]thymidine uptake) over 16 h and the formation of epithelial monolayer cultures on plastic. Thus, this simple method yields a highly enriched cell population that maintains high viability in vitro for at least 16 h. Such cells may be useful for the study of the biology of colonic epithelial cells.\r"

All subjects received four treatments in a random sequence: sucralfate + ethanol, sucralfate + ethanol placebo, sucralfate placebo + ethanol, and sucralfate placebo + ethanol placebo. Fundal, antral, and duodenal mucosae were submitted to endoscopic examinations, and the antral mucosa underwent histologic examination before and after injury. Biopsy specimens were taken from the antral mucosa to determine by radioimmunoassay its capacity to synthesize prostaglandin E2, thromboxane B2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha. In both the fundus and the antrum, the mean endoscopic injury score after sucralfate plus ethanol administration was significantly lower than that after ethanol alone. All treatments tended to increase prostanoid values but 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha increased significantly when sucralfate was given. Sucralfate did not affect serum ethanol levels, nor did ethanol affect prostanoid synthesis. It is concluded that sucralfate provides significant protection to the human gastric mucosa against ethanol injury, and that this may be partly due to increased prostanoid synthesis.\r"

Twenty-one hybridoma cultures obtained were screened on tissue sections of gastric mucosa to identify antibodies that did not cross-react with host cells. To select antibodies with high grade of specificity to C. pylori, hybridomas were also screened by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against a wide panel of gram-negative bacteria. Fifteen antibodies showed a variable grade of cross-reactivity with gastric mucosa, indicating the presence of at least three epitopes shared by C. pylori and epithelial cells. Three of the six antibodies non-reacting with gastric mucosa (CB-1, CB-26, and CB-31) also were found to be specific for C. pylori. Using CB-26 in an indirect immunoperoxidase test, gastric brushings from 60 patients consecutively undergoing endoscopic examination were examined. By light microscopy, we observed the presence of large amounts of C. pylori in smears from all the 32 patients with positive culture. A small number of bacterial cells were also seen in 8 of 28 patients whose cultures were negative. These findings suggest that the monoclonal antibody CB-26 might be of value for rapid and specific detection of C. pylori.\r"

However, the anatomic correlates of gastrointestinal ultrasound images have not been precisely defined. We have compared ultrasound images with the corresponding histologic sections of 81 specimens of resected and postmortem, normal and diseased gastrointestinal tissue. The five layers seen on ultrasound images of the normal gastrointestinal tract correspond to (1) superficial mucosa, (2) deep mucosa, (3) submucosa plus the acoustical interface between the submucosa and muscularis propria, (4) muscularis propria minus the acoustical interface between the submucosa and muscularis propria, and (5) serosa and subserosal fat. This interpretation takes into consideration the echoes produced by the tissue layers and the echoes produced by the interfaces between layers. Abnormal findings on ultrasound images of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases correspond to histologic tissue structure. When properly interpreted, ultrasound images of the gastrointestinal wall can provide potentially useful diagnostic information.\r"

Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that half as much of the endotoxin's lipid, relative to polysaccharide, was released by the cells. Density gradients revealed that native endotoxin equilibrated at a density of 1.412 g/ml, whereas endotoxin retained by Kupffer cells equilibrated at densities of 1.274 and 1.295 g/ml. Gel permeation chromatography indicated that endotoxin retained by Kupffer cells formed a larger micelle than either exocytosed or native endotoxin. Endotoxin exocytosed by Kupffer cells fractionated into two peaks, one with a smaller and one with a larger apparent micelle size than native endotoxin but both smaller than the retained lipopolysaccharide. Both systems indicated that the Kupffer cell modified endotoxin by enriching the lipid content of the molecule and shortening the length of the O-antigen. Thus, the Kuffer cell, in its mode of action on the endotoxin molecule, appears to play a prominent role in the initial phase of a biochemical process for endotoxin clearance and detoxification.\r"

The prevalence for Mexican American women (23.2%) was 1.5 times that of Cuban American women and 1.7 times that of Puerto Rican women. Rates were about three times higher among women than men and increased with age in both sexes and all ethnic groups except older Puerto Rican women.

In both cases, unconjugated bilirubin accounted for a large percentage of the total bile biliary pigments measured, and stercobilin was present in gallbladder bile. Bile beta-glucuronidase activity was higher when measured at the optimal pH of bacterial rather than tissue beta-glucuronidase. Analysis of stone morphology and composition showed characteristics of brown pigment gallstones with a layered appearance and the presence of calcium palmitate. This is the first report of detailed bile and stone analysis in infants and supports the hypothesis that brown pigment gallstones form spontaneously in infants who have bacterial infections in the biliary tract.\r"

Current evidence indicates that estrogen therapy will prevent bone loss and reduce the incidence of fractures. The major problem is identification of those most at risk of fracture. Currently, risk factor assessment and bone mass measurement used in combination offer the closest approximation to the ideal, although it is not yet completely clear how good identification is. Together these estimates of risk need only be used for those about whom there is a question concerning the use of estrogen, and need not be used for patients who have either already decided to initiate preventive treatment or have decided not to start such a program.\r"

Physiologic changes of aging may adversely affect function, but these effects may be partially reversible (if exacerbated by inactivity)--or may be compensated for by appropriate training. Emphasis is on functionally significant goals that can be achieved within a generally predictable period of time. The achievement of these significant goals would allow the patient to remain in or return to a home setting and avoid institutionalization.

Non-modulators comprise 50% of normal- and high-renin essential hypertensive individuals and are defined by their abnormal adrenal and renal responses to infused Ang II. This study sought to determine if the abnormal Ang II suppression of PRA in essential hypertension is specific to non-modulators. We measured PRA suppression during infusion of Ang II in 22 normotensive and 32 hypertensive (16 modulators and 16 non-modulators) subjects. A significant correlation between basal PRA and the fall in PRA in response to Ang II infusion was seen in the normotensives (r = -0.934, p less than 0.001) and modulators (r = -0.831, p less than 0.001) but not in the non-modulators (r = -0.275, p = 0.304). However, after 3 days of converting enzyme inhibition therapy, the correlation between basal PRA and decrement in PRA was significant in the non-modulators (r = -0.762, p less than 0.01). Thus, the abnormal PRA suppression documented previously in hypertensive individuals is a defect specific to non-modulators and is corrected with converting enzyme inhibition therapy.\r"

The sensitivity of baroreflex control of heart rate and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity were determined by the slopes of the relation between the change in mean arterial pressure (MAP) (mm Hg) versus the change in pulse interval (msec/beat) and the change in MAP versus the percent change in nerve activity, respectively. Untreated SHR had significantly higher MAP than WKY (157 +/- 3 vs. 115 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) and exhibited a decreased baroreflex control of heart rate. Lifetime treatment with captopril prevented the development of hypertension in SHR (MAP = 110 +/- 5 mm Hg) and increased the sensitivity of baroreflex function. The gains of the baroreflex control of heart rate for captopril-treated SHR and control SHR when MAP was raised or lowered by phenylephrine or nitroprusside were 2.38 +/- 0.49 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.33 msec/mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 0.74 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.09 (NS) msec/mm Hg, respectively.

Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 10(-7) M), but not the inert compound phorbol, supported the in vitro survival of day 11 CFU-S for 72 h in a manner similar to IL 3. PMA also enhanced the effect of IL 3 on the in vitro survival of day 11 CFU-S and as little as 1 h of exposure to PMA was sufficient for this purpose. The effect of PMA on CFU-S survival in vitro was not mediated by prostaglandins, did not require an established adherent cell population, and was observed at a concentration of 10(-9) M. PMA alone did not enhance the in vitro survival of day 11 CFU-S at very low concentrations of FCS but was still able to potentiate the effect of IL 3 on these cells. PMA also enhanced the in vitro survival of day 11 CFU-S from mice treated with 5-fluorouracil or from marrow cells exposed to merocyanine 540 and light. The interaction of PMA with day 11 CFU-S was not inhibited by a neutralizing antiserum to IL 3 but was inhibited by the protein kinase inhibitor H-7. Together, the data indicate that tumor-promoting phorbol esters interact with pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. Like IL 3, their effect appears to be permissive and involves stem cells with marrow repopulating ability.\r"

To analyze the nature of the hyperresponsiveness and its potential relation to a state of protective immunity in such individuals, strict clinical, parasitological, and serological criteria were applied to select seven \"infection-free\" endemic normal individuals (ENs) from a population of 459 persons resident in an area heavily endemic for bancroftian filariasis. Immunoblot analysis was used to compare the qualitative antigen recognition patterns of these endemic normal individuals to those of a group of 12 clearly infected microfilaremic individuals (MFs) from the same endemic area. Though immunoblot analysis using microfilarial and adult stage filarial antigens revealed no distinct differences in antigen recognition patterns between the two groups, when responses to infective larval stage antigens were assessed, 7/7 (100%) of the ENs were found to recognize a 43-kD antigen that was recognized by only 1/12 (8%) of the MFs. These findings are consistent with the concept that recognition of unique larval antigens may induce protective immunity to human filarial parasites and they identify a candidate immunogen for further functional assessment.\r"

  ".W": "Osteoblasts are the cells responsible for the secretion of collagen and ultimately the formation of new bone. These cells have also been shown to regulate osteoclast activity by the secretion of cytokines, which remain to be defined. In an attempt to identify these unknown cytokines, we have induced primary murine osteoblasts with two bone active agents, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and analyzed the conditioned media (CM) for the presence of specific cytokines. Analysis of the CM was accomplished by functional, biochemical, and serological techniques. The data indicate that both PTH and LPS are capable of inducing the osteoblasts to secrete a cytokine, which by all of the techniques used, is indistinguishable from granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Secretion of GM-CSF is not constitutive and requires active induction. Production of the cytokine is dependent on the dose of PTH or LPS added. It has been demonstrated that the addition of GM-CSF to bone marrow cultures results in the formation of increased numbers of osteoclasts. Therefore, these data suggest that osteoblasts not only participate in bone remodeling by formation of new matrix but may regulate osteoclast activity indirectly by their ability to regulate hematopoiesis.\r"

  ".W": "Supernatants obtained by degranulation of dog mastocytoma cells greatly increased the sensitivity and the magnitude of the contractile response of isolated dog bronchial smooth muscle to histamine. The enhanced contractile response was reversed completely by H1-receptor antagonists and was prevented by an inhibitor of tryptase (a major protease released with histamine from secretory granules of mast cells). The potentiation of histamine-induced contractions was reproduced by active tryptase in pure form. The contractions due to the combination of histamine and purified tryptase were abolished by the Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine and verapamil. The bronchoconstricting effects of KCl and serotonin, which, like histamine, contract airway smooth muscle by a mechanism predominantly involving membrane potential-dependent Ca2+ transport, were also potentiated by tryptase. However, the contractile effects of acetylcholine, which contracts dog airway smooth muscle by a mechanism independent of Ca2+ channels, were unaffected by tryptase. These findings show a striking promotion of agonist-induced bronchial smooth muscle contraction by mast cell tryptase, via direct or indirect effects on Ca2+ channels, and the findings therefore suggest a novel potential mechanism of hyperresponsiveness in dog bronchi.\r"

Insulin acutely increased mean delta (6 h minus prestudy) levels of androstenedione (A) (P less than or equal to 0.001) and estradiol (E2) (P less than or equal to 0.05) and decreased mean plasma pool (0-6 h) levels of testosterone (T) (P less than 0.05), nonsex hormone binding globulin-bound T (P less than 0.05), and dihydrotestosterone (P less than or equal to 0.01) in the PCO women. Insulin also decreased mean plasma 6 h A to estrone (E1) ratios and increased 6 h E1 levels (both P less than or equal to 0.05) in the PCO women. There were significant sequence effects (insulin + day) in the PCO women on T/E2 ratios, indicating a carryover action of insulin. Insulin had no effects on gonadotropin release in the PCO women. In the normal women, the only significant change was an insulin or study day effect that increased mean 6 h E2 levels (P less than or equal to 0.01). There were significant spontaneous decreases in mean luteinizing hormone (p less than 0.05) and follicle-stimulating hormone levels (p less than or equal to 0.01) in the PCO but not the normal women on the second day of study. This study indicates that insulin can directly alter peripheral sex hormone levels independent of changes in gonadotropin release in insulin-resistent PCO women. Insulin decreased the levels of potent androgens in PCO women and did not increase androgen levels in normal women, arguing against a simple, direct causal relationship between hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism in PCO.\r"

Either Escherichia coli (a microorganism with endotoxin) or Staphylococcus aureus (a microorganism without endotoxin) were placed in an intraperitoneal clot in doses of viable or formalin-killed bacteria. Cardiovascular function of conscious animals was studied using simultaneous radionuclide heart scans and thermodilution cardiac outputs. Serial plasma endotoxin levels were measured. S. aureus produced a pattern of reversible cardiovascular dysfunction over 7-10 d that was concordant (P less than 0.01) with that of E. coli. Although this cardiovascular pattern was not altered by formalin killing (S. aureus and E. coli), formalin-killed organisms produced a lower mortality and less myocardial depression (P less than 0.01). S. aureus, compared to E. coli, produced higher postmortem concentrations of microorganisms and higher mortality (P less than 0.025). E. coli produced significant endotoxemia (P less than 0.01), though viable organisms (versus nonviable) resulted in higher endotoxin blood concentrations (P less than 0.05). Significant endotoxemia did not occur with S. aureus. Thus, in the absence of endotoxemia, S. aureus induced the same cardiovascular abnormalities of septic shock as E. coli. These findings indicate that structurally and functionally distinct microorganisms, with or without endotoxin, can activate a common pathway resulting in similar cardiovascular injury and mortality.\r"

The present studies in anesthetized dogs were designed to determine the action of endothelin on cardiovascular-renal and endocrine function in vivo as in acute arterial pressure-volume regulation. Intravenous infusion of endothelin (50 ng/kg per min) increases arterial pressure by increasing peripheral vascular resistance but in association with an increase in coronary vascular resistance and decreases in cardiac output. Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were markedly reduced in association with a sustained reduction in sodium excretion and an increase in plasma renin activity. Atrial natriuretic factor, vasopressin, and aldosterone were also elevated. These results indicate that endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor that elevates systemic blood pressure in association with marked decreases in cardiovascular and renal function. This peptide may function as a counterregulatory hormone to the effects of endothelial-derived vasodilator agent(s).\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the actions of endothelin in anesthetized rats and cultured mesangial cells. Intravenous infusion of endothelin (10 pmol/min) decreased renal blood flow by 44% at 20 min without changing arterial pressure, which subsequently rose significantly from 124 +/- 3 to 133 +/- 4 mmHg over 60 min. Micropuncture during the nonhypertensive period revealed increases in afferent (65%) and efferent (82%) arteriolar resistances, thereby reducing nephron plasma flow rate. The glomerular ultrafiltration coefficient (Kf) fell from 0.097 +/- 0.035 to 0.031 +/- 0.011 nl/(s.mmHg) as did single nephron filtration rate (41 +/- 3 to 19 +/- 3 nl/min). Addition of 5 nM endothelin to mesangial cells plated on a silicone rubber substrate increased the intensity and number of tension-generated wrinkles, and caused their reappearance in forskolin prerelaxed cells. 20-30 s following exposure of fura-2 loaded mesangial cells to 10 nM endothelin, single cell intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca]i) increased from a mean baseline value of 66 +/- 11 (SE) to a peak of 684 +/- 250 nM (P less than 0.05) followed by a sustained elevation at 145 +/- 42 nM. Anion exchange HPLC revealed rapid (15 s) and dose-dependent stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation following exposure of [3H]myoinositol preloaded mesangial cells to 10-100 nM endothelin. Endothelin also led to intracellular alkalinization of 2'7'-bis(2-carboxy-ethyl)-5(and-6)carboxyfluorescein (BCECF)-loaded mesangial cells and its addition was associated with dramatic augmentation of mitogenic activity. Thus, endothelin exerts potent constrictor effects on renal arterioles which precede its systemic hypertensive action. It lowers Kf and contracts mesangial cells, likely through stimulation of IP3 generation and elevation of [Ca]i. It is a potent mesangial cell mitogen. These studies define functional responses and signal transduction pathways for endothelin in the rat kidney and propose a potential role for this peptide in the control of mesangial cell function, glomerular filtration rate, and renal vascular tone.\r"

  ".W": "Genomic DNA from a patient with dystrophic myopathy, glycerol kinase deficiency, and congenital adrenal hypoplasia was investigated using cDNA probes for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) locus. Genomic probes had not detected a deletion in this patient. Southern analysis of Hind III-digested genomic DNA from this patient identified a deletion when the three distal Hinc II DMD cDNA fragments were used as probes. The deletion began in the genomic region corresponding to the 1.05-kb Hinc II cDNA fragment and extended through the 3' end of the DMD gene. This represents a centromeric breakpoint that corresponds to a position approximately 10.2-10.6 kb from the 5' end of the 14-kb DMD cDNA. These investigations demonstrate the value of the DMD cDNA probes for improved diagnoses in patients with molecular lesions involving the DMD locus. Furthermore, this novel deletion involving the coding portion of the 3' end of the DMD gene assists in the ordering of exons in this region and will provide insight into the functional role of the carboxy terminus of the DMD gene product, dystrophin.\r"

Two hundred eighty-five (62% women) elderly participated in the intervention group and 287 (62% women) in the control group. Information about the number of admissions to hospitals, the number of bed days, the main reason for hospitalization, the diagnoses on discharge, and the residence after discharge was collected. Two hundred nineteen admissions (4,884 bed days) were registered for the intervention group compared with 271 (6,442 bed days) for the control group. During the second half of the study, a significant reduction in the number of admissions--especially readmissions--to hospitals was seen in the intervention group. The mean risk per person of being hospitalized was 24%, 20%, and 20% in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively, for the intervention group, and 22%, 25%, and 28% for the controls. The mean number of bed days per admission did not differ between the two groups. Using the results to make a general epidemiologic and longitudinal assessment of the admissions of elderly aged 75 or older, the following can be concluded: 4% of the participants used 42% of the bed days, and most of these people awaited alternative residential accommodation; 62% stayed less than 2 weeks in the hospital. The main reason for hospitalization was fall episodes among women (20%) and dyspnea among men (18%). Approximately three-fourths were discharged to their own homes or to the family, while 18% died. Preventive home visits seem to be one of the tools to improve the future lives of the elderly in their own homes.\r"

The three other T cell clones were specific for regions 2-602, 604-742, and 865-1315 of tetanus toxin, respectively. The five T cell clones were shown to be restricted to HLA-DR Ag. Furthermore, the allele of HLA-DR utilized by the various epitopes has been determined. The use of HLA-DR-transfected L cells as APC directly demonstrated that two epitopes, one of which represented by fragment 1273-1284, were recognized in association with HLA-DRw52a. For the other three T cell epitopes, the data strongly suggested they were recognized in association with HLA-DR5. Finally, a sixth T cell clone was shown to be specific for tetanus toxoid, the vaccinal preparation of tetanus toxin, and not for other tetanus toxin fragments. This indicated that immunization with tetanus toxoid probably elicits a T cell response directed only in part against native tetanus toxin.\r"

Monokine induction of ACH-2 cells resulted in augmented virus production reflected by an increase in reverse transcriptase activity and in the synthesis of all major viral proteins. Examination of the cells by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that 10 to 15% of uninduced cells constitutively expressed HIV proteins, whereas 100% showed positive immunofluorescence in response to LPS-MO SN. This induction of virus by LPS-MO SN resulted in approximately a 100-fold increase of infectious virus production over uninduced ACH-2 cells. LPS alone could not induce HIV-1 expression, whereas LPS-MO SN resulted in the greatest virus expression. Cell separation studies confirmed the source of the inducing factor(s) to be cells bearing the mature monocyte/macrophage marker, Leu M3. Biochemical fractionation of the LPS-MO SN suggested that one or more factors, having apparent Mr of approximately 45 kDa, were involved in this induction. Absorption of the LPS-MO SN with immunoaffinity gels specific for human TNF-alpha was shown to completely remove the HIV inducing activity for the ACH-2 cell line.\r"

  ".W": "Transfusion with blood from the organ donor before transplantation can prolong the survival of renal allografts in the rat. To determine if the beneficial effect of preoperative blood transfusion was due to the generation of donor-specific suppressor cells, in vivo and in vitro adoptive transfer experiments were performed. Lymphoid cells were harvested from transfused and untreated rats. These cells were then either (1) transferred to lightly irradiated (200 R) syngeneic hosts which were subsequently challenged with a kidney allograft (in vivo assay) or (2) titrated as regulator cells into naive unidirectional MLC such that the regulator and responder populations were syngeneic. In the LEW-RT1 to DA-RT1av1 strain combination, the adoptive transfer of thoracic duct lymph (TDL) or lymph node (LN) cells (5 x 10(7) to 7.5 x 10(7) cells) from DA animals transfused with LEW blood, 7 days previously into syngeneic (DA), lightly irradiated (200 R) hosts resulted in the indefinite survival of LEW kidney allografts. The phenomenon was blood donor-specific and dose-dependent. In contrast the adoptive transfer of spleen cells (10(7) to 10(8] from blood transfused hosts 7 days after transfusion had no effect on renal allograft survival. In vitro the addition of LN or TDL regulator cells, harvested from DA rats transfused with LEW blood, to a unidirectional MLC (DA responders, LEW stimulators) resulted in a significant depression of the proliferative response when compared with the proliferation of these same cells without the addition of these regulator cells or with the addition of LN or TDL regulator cells from a DA rat transfused with third party (PVG-RT1c) blood. The depression of the proliferative response observed in vitro, was blood donor specific. When LN or TDL regulator cells from a DA rat transfused with PVG-RT1c blood were added to a unidirectional MLC between DA responders and PVG stimulators, a significant depression in the proliferative response was observed. These in vitro findings were confirmed in two other strain combinations (LEW-PVG, and DA-PVG). Thus a single blood transfusion results in the induction of donor-specific suppressor cells detectable both in vivo and in vitro 7 days after transfusion in some but not all lymphoid compartments.\r"

About 20% of freshly isolated alveolar macrophages formed colonies in both liquid and soft agar cultures in the presence of GM-CSF. GM-CSF was also found to be capable of maintaining the survival of these colony-forming cells in vitro. Moreover, GM-CSF could substitute for CSF-1 in maintaining the survival of CSF-1-responding pulmonary alveolar macrophage colony-forming cells in the absence of CSF-1. The concentration of GM-CSF required for maintaining the survival of colony-forming cells without proliferation was much lower than that required for the proliferation of these cells in vitro. It also enhanced the CSF-1-dependent clonal growth of alveolar macrophages. These data suggest that the colony-forming cells that respond to GM-CSF are the same subset of macrophages that form colonies in the presence of CSF-1. GM-CSF did not inhibit the binding of 125I-CSF-1 to alveolar macrophages at 0 degrees C. However, the preincubation of macrophages with GM-CSF at 37 degrees C resulted in a transient down-regulation of CSF-1 binding activity.\r"

We have hypothesized that such factors could also activate macrophage (M phi) tumor lysis and might be stored in the cytoplasmic granules. Granules were isolated from the RNK large granular lymphocyte leukemias by nitrogen cavitation and Percoll fractionation of the cell homogenate. Utilizing CSF-1 differentiated murine bone marrow-derived M phi and P815 tumor target cells, a M phi-activating factor (MAF) was found. The MAF activity was identified in two peaks, the first was coincident with dense granule enzymes and was 60 times more concentrated per mg protein than a second peak in the cytosol fractions. Solubilization in 2 M NaCl was necessary to recover activity from both peaks. Granule NK-MAF required the simultaneous presence of LPS in order to induce tumoricidal activity. Kinetics of NK-MAF activation peaked after 12 h of exposure. The NK-MAF was short lived in the solubilized granules; however, its heat resistance allowed us to prepare enriched and stable preparations. Treatment of NK-MAF with pepsin but not trypsin completely abrogated its activity. The NK-MAF passed through an ultrafiltration membrane with a nominal cut-off of 10 kDa. This work indicates that NK cell granules contain a small heat-stable peptide capable of activating M phi tumoricidal activity.\r"

In serum free medium 2 mg/ml alpha 2M suppressed target cell lysis in a 4-h cytotoxic assay with about 40%. Suppression was dose and time dependent. Cytotoxicity was unaffected by alpha 2M concentrations less than 0.25 mg/ml, and by alpha 2M added later than 1.5 h from start of assay. Pre-treatment of effector (but not of target) cells with alpha 2M was even more suppressive than the presence of alpha 2M during assay. Cell-mediated cytotoxicity was not inhibited by alpha 2M treated with methylamine or by various alpha 2M-proteinase complexes. In contrast, alpha 2M-proteinase complex as well as native alpha 2M suppressed the proliferation of Ag-activated T cells. However, methylamine-treated alpha 2M did not inhibit T cell proliferation, and suppression by alpha 2M-proteinase complex was significantly reduced after inhibition of the alpha 2M-bound proteinase. On incubation at 4 degrees C with lymphokine-activated killer cells, alpha 2M reacted with cell associated proteinases and changed from electrophoretically \"slow\" to \"fast\" form. Cell associated proteinases bound by alpha 2M showed chymotrypsin- and trypsin-like specificities and their activity surpassed activity caused by cellular leakage and secretion. The present results strongly indicate that alpha 2M mediates immunosuppression in its capacity as a proteinase inhibitor and suggest inhibition of (T)cell surface-associated proteinases as a possible mode of suppression.\r"

In this manuscript we provide experimental evidence to support the concept that the refractory state of B cells from endotoxin-unresponsive mice to mitogenic stimulation by LPS does not extend to R-chemotype LPS isolated from a variety of rough strains of Salmonella or Escherichia coli. We present several lines of evidence to suggest that the observed mitogenic activity is not the result of contamination of LPS with lipid A-associated proteins. The mitogenic activity of LPS extracted from rough strain mutant bacteria (R-LPS) appears to be dependent upon a structural requirement of the LPS in which the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonate linkage of lipid A with core oligosaccharides is intact. Both alkaline and acid hydrolysis of R-LPS abrogates mitogenic activity in C3H/HeJ splenocytes; only the former is effective in reducing activity of the same LPS preparations in histocompatible normal splenocytes. Finally, we have found that the addition of either polymyxin B or S-chemotype LPS to R-LPS-stimulated C3H/HeJ splenocytes has only minimal effects on the mitogenic activity of the latter. These combined data would indicate that the concept of LPS-unresponsiveness of the C3H/HeJ and C57B1/10ScN inbred mouse strains is not necessarily applicable to all protein-free LPS preparations.\r"

After 2 h, BAM killed encapsulated strains CN52 and MP415 more readily than acapsular strains CN602 and CAP67 (54.9 and 36.2% vs 26.1 and 6.7%, respectively, p less than 0.001). Pre-incubating CN602 with purified capsular polysaccharide increased killing to 42.7% (p = 0.04). Significantly greater killing of the encapsulated strains also occurred in vivo. BAM-mediated killing of CN52 appeared to proceed by non-oxidative mechanisms, as BAM released minimal amounts of H2O2 after stimulation with CN52, and killing was not reduced by inhibitors or scavengers of the respiratory burst. The association between encapsulation and susceptibility to BAM fungicidal effects was not attributable to differences in yeast ingestion. Using the same low ratio of organisms to BAM as in the killing assay, greater than 95% of both CN52 and CN602 were phagocytosed. However, BAM phagocytosed significantly greater numbers of acapsular CN602 when incubated with a higher inoculum. Phagocytosis and killing of CN52 and CN602 required fresh serum as a source of C. Phagocytosis of CN52, but not CN602, was profoundly inhibited if BAM were plated on surfaces coated with mAb against the C3bR (CR1). mAb against the iC3b receptor (CR3) did not affect phagocytosis of either strain. These data demonstrate the innate ability of BAM to preferentially kill, by apparently non-oxidative mechanisms, an encapsulated as opposed to acapsular organism. Inasmuch as different receptors appear involved in phagocytosis of encapsulated versus acapsular C. neoformans, the disparity in killing may result from the greater ability of receptors mediating uptake of encapsulated organisms to trigger the antimicrobial armamentarium of the BAM.\r"

  ".W": "The cellular ets genes (ets-1, ets-2, and erg) have been identified by their sequence similarity with the v-ets oncogene of the avian erythroblastosis virus, E26. Products of the ets-2 gene have been detected in a wide range of normal mouse tissues and their expression appears to be associated with cell proliferation in regenerating liver. In contrast, the ets-1 gene was previously shown to be more highly expressed in the mouse thymus than in other tissues. Because the thymic tissue contains various subsets of cells in different stages of proliferation and maturation, we have examined ets gene expression in fetal thymocytes from different stages of development, in isolated subsets of adult thymocytes, and in peripheral T lymphocytes. Expression of the ets-1 gene was first detected at day 18 in fetal thymocytes, corresponding to the first appearance of CD4+ (CD4+, CD8-) thymocytes, and reaches maximal/plateau levels of expression in the thymus at 1 to 2 days after birth. The ets-2 gene expression is detected at least 1 day earlier, coinciding with the presence of both double-positive (CD4+, CD8+) and double-negative (CD4-, CD8-) blast thymocytes and reaches maximal/plateau levels 1 day before birth. In the adult thymus, ets-1 and ets-2 mRNA expression is 10- to 8-fold higher respectively in the CD4+ subset than in the other subsets examined. Higher levels of p55 ets-1 protein were also shown to exist in the CD4+ subset. Because the CD4+ thymic subset is the pool from which the CD4+ peripheral, helper/inducer T cells are derived, the ets gene expression was examined in lymph node T cells. Both the CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells subsets had lower ets RNA levels than the CD4+ thymocytes. These results suggest that ets-2 and more particularly ets-1 gene products play an important role in T cell development and differentiation and are not simply associated with proliferating cells, which are observed at a higher frequency in fetal thymocytes, or dull Ly-1 (low CD5+), and double-negative (CD4-, CD8-) adult thymocytes. Selectively enhanced expression of ets-1 gene may be observed in thymic CD4+ thymocytes because these cells have uniquely encountered MHC class II or other Ag in the thymic environment. These cells may have been subsequently stimulated to activate the ets genes in conjunction with their differentiation of helper/inducer function(s) and expression of mature TCR.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "F(ab')2 and Fab fragments of murine monoclonal antibody 9.2.27, that recognizes the 250 kD melanoma-associated antigen, were labeled with 99mTc using the bifunctional chelate method of Fritzberg et al. Twenty-seven (27) patients received, intravenously, 10 mg of either F(ab')2 (8), or the Fab (27), labeled with up to 30 mCi of 99mTc. These doses were preceded by an infusion of cold irrelevant antibody. The average serum T1/2 of the F(ab')2 and the Fab were 11 hr and 2 hr, respectively. Twenty-two percent (22%) of the total injected F(ab')2 dose was excreted in the urine in 20 hr, compared to 55% for the Fab group. Imaging was optimal 6-9 hr postinjection for the Fab patients. No nonspecific uptake in liver, spleen, bone marrow, or lung was observed for either antibody form. Overall, (43/53) 81% of known metastases were seen with visualization of tumors as small as 250 mg and tumor localization as high as 0.03% injected dose/g. Immunoperoxidase staining of freshly-frozen tumor nodules removed 24 hr postinjection confirmed antibody deposition in the tumor. Thirty-six previously unknown (\"occult\") metastatic sites were detected. To date, 12/36 of these sites have been confirmed. We conclude that 99mTc-labeled antibody to melanoma produces high resolution images with a high sensitivity of detecting metastatic melanoma. The detection of previously unknown sites of disease has proven helpful in directing additional diagnostic studies (i.e., CT) as well as planning of therapeutic options.\r"

In 19 patients with myocardial infarction a significant correlation was present between MIBI segmental wall motion and perfusion scores (p less than 0.001). In ten patients with a history of myocardial infarction, 18 myocardial segments demonstrated diseased coronary vessels and impaired wall motion at contrast angiography. These segments were all identified by the MIBI wall motion and perfusion study.

Five patients had hypertension with unilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) angiographically documented and six patients had essential hypertension (EH). Total and split GFR were determined under control conditions and after oral administration of captopril (50 mg). In the patients with RAS, captopril induced a significant decrease of GFR in the stenotic kidneys (from 42.4 +/- 4 to 29.6 +/- 3 ml/min, p less than 0.01), while no changes were observed in the nonstenotic kidneys (from 61.2 +/- 3 to 61.6 +/- 5 ml/min, NS). Total GFR was 103.6 +/- 5 ml/min under control conditions and decreased to 91.8 +/- 6 ml/min after captopril (p less than 0.05). No significant changes of GFR were detected after captopril administration in patients with EH. In a separate group of ten patients with EH, good correlation between 24-hr creatinine clearance and fractional uptake of [99mTc]DTPA was obtained. Good reproducibility of this radionuclide technique was also shown. This study demonstrates that the computed radionuclide GFR determination coupled with the captopril test allows one to unmask angiotensin II-dependent renal function and hemodynamic changes. This technique can be useful in clinical practice for identifying patients with renovascular hypertension.\r"

Microscopically the majority of the gelatin was unidentifiable at 1 week and there was no evidence of a rejection response. The degree of new bone formation and tissue response in hydroxylapatite-gelatin mixture group was essentially the same as in the hydroxylapatite group. The results indicate that gelatin is an excellent adherent for particulate hydroxylapatite, enabling easy handling and proper placement of the material with no inhibitory effect on new bone formation.\r"

In contrast, all benign breast biopsies and normal cells were Gal alpha 1-3Gal negative. Affinity-purified anti-alpha-galactosyl IgG (anti-Gal) antibody, which specifically recognizes Gal alpha 1-3Gal residues, significantly inhibited cell attachment in two in vitro assays thought to indicate tumor cell extravasation of the circulatory system during the metastatic process: attachment to perfused human umbilical vein endothelium, and attachment to isolated laminin.

  ".W": "Allograft skin lyophilised in 98% glycerol is an effective overlay for widely expanded autografts. The technique was evaluated clinically on a total of 58 sandwich grafting procedures in a group of 39 patients with extensive third-degree burns. Forty-five grafting operations performed within 10 days postburn all resulted in an epithelialisation rate of at least 75% within 5 weeks. Thirty-three of these procedures achieved complete (more than 95%) wound closure. Of 13 operations performed after the 14th postburn day, ten resulted in a wound epithelialisation of at least 75%. Epithelial quality and cosmetic results were good. The mean length of hospitalisation was 56 days. One patient died from unassociated respiratory failure. The absence of allograft viability did not impair its function as an autograft overlay. The apparent attenuation of allograft antigenicity conferred by the action of 98% glycerol may have contributed to the results achieved. The process of cadaver skin preservation in 98% glycerol is simple and inexpensive.\r"

We report an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a strain of S. aureus devoid of Protein A, a frequent cause of false positive results in ELISAs, and have used this assay to study antibody responses of 23 severely injured patients. This IgM ELISA had a diagnostic sensitivity for major Staphylococcal infection of 70% (seven of ten patients with major infection) and a specificity of 92% (12 of 13 patients without major infection). Of three patients with major Staphylococcal infections who mounted no IgM response, two died and the other developed severe chronic Staphylococcal infection, and hence prompt initiation of appropriate therapy was necessary. Furthermore, the ability to mount IgM response to Staphylococcal infections appears to contribute to an orchestrated host defense response against this organism.\r"

  ".W": "Duplex ultrasound scanning has been used to assess mesenteric blood flow in normal and disease states. To investigate this technique we studied nine normal volunteers at rest and under conditions known to modify intestinal blood flow. After a baseline mesenteric duplex scan, each subject was given one of three treatments in random order: (1) test meal (710 kcal), (2) intravenous glucagon (40 micrograms/min), or (3) intravenous vasopressin (0.2 units/min). Peak systolic and diastolic velocities and vessel diameters were measured at intervals after treatment in the celiac and the superior mesenteric arteries (SMAs) and the right common carotid artery. Resting velocities did not differ among the groups. Peak systolic velocity increased significantly in both celiac and SMAs after the meal, with maximal changes in the celiac artery preceding those in the SMA in most subjects. Early diastolic flow reversal in the SMA was consistently lost after the meal (eight of nine subjects). Velocity changes after glucagon closely paralleled those after the meal. Vasopressin produced significant decreases in peak systolic velocity in both visceral vessels. No changes in vessel diameter were noted after any treatment. Coefficient of variation for repeated measures of peak velocities was 19% in the celiac and 12% to 16% in the SMA and the common carotid. The coefficient of variation for repeated measurements of arterial diameter was 6% to 8% in the SMA and 11% in the celiac artery. Clinically relevant changes in mesenteric hemodynamics can be reproducibly detected and quantitated by means of current duplex ultrasound technology. The similarities between the visceral arterial responses to a meal and glucagon are of interest.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Although the average preservation time of the UW-preserved livers was almost twice as long as that of the Euro-Collins-preserved livers, the UW-preserved grafts survived at a higher rate; permitted equal patient survival; and had a lower rate of primary nonfunction, a reduced need for retransplantation, and a lower rate of hepatic artery thrombosis. There was no correlation between the time of preservation of UW-preserved grafts up to 24 hours and liver function abnormalities in the first postoperative week. In contrast, livers preserved with Euro-Collins solution for more than five hours had significantly increased perturbations of hepatic function tests. The potential revolutionary effect of the UW solution on liver transplantation is described herein.\r"

By far the most difficult and underestimated component of this system is the screening and interpretation of cervical (Papanicolaou) smears. Cytologic case finding may fail because of inadequate samples, insufficient time devoted to screening, or human fatigue. Other weak points of the system, such as an inadequate clinical component, inadequate patient compliance, poor reproducibility of diagnoses, and ineffective aftercare, are also described. For example, obtaining a second smear to confirm or refute a diagnosis of cellular atypia is often a misleading practice. Although this cancer detection system has been shown to be effective in reducing the rate of morbidity and mortality from invasive cervical cancer in appropriately screened populations, there is no evidence that the Papanicolaou test has succeeded anywhere in complete eradication of this theoretically preventable disease. It is important to inform the public about the potential failures of the system and the reasons for them.\r"

In eight surviving recipients and five healthy dogs (control group), pulmonary flow-resistance relationships were investigated at flows in the range of 0.3 to 2.0 L/min at 0.1 L/min increments. Resistance decreased from 2585 to 746 dyne.sec.cm-5 in the successful group (five allografts receiving complete studies) and 2400 to 891 in the control group with an increase of flow. Lung water content of the successful group was 2.0 times that of the control group (successful group, 95.6 +/- 16.7 gm; control group, 47.8 +/- 7.5 gm), and water content of the other allografts (unsuccessful group), including allografts of dogs that died before investigations, was 2.2 times that of the successful group (unsuccessful group, 211.0 +/- 89.6 gm). The chest roentgenograms of the successful group showed mild or moderate consolidations, whereas those of the unsuccessful group showed severe consolidations, but no difference was found in pulmonary flow-resistance relationships between the successful and the control groups. These results show that the allografts, which have about twice the water content of normal lung, maintain adequate pulmonary vascular function. We concluded that single lung transplantation could be an effective treatment for pulmonary hypertension.\r"

Various surgical procedures have been described to repair chordal abnormalities of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve with unpredictable results. Mitral valve replacement is usually recommended in that situation. This report describes a simple repair technique that we have devised. We resected one or two marginal chordae of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve in 35 sheep and replaced them with a double-armed, pledget-supported, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene suture. The 30 surviving animals were studied hemodynamically and were electively put to death 3, 6, 9, 18, and 24 months after the operation. Mitral insufficiency did not develop in any of the sheep. All specimens had a normal mitral valve without thrombosis. The polytetrafluoroethylene suture remained pliable and was incorporated into the anterior leaflet and papillary muscle. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy showed that the suture was completely covered by a sheath of tissue with a collagen structure remarkably similar to that of a native chorda. Calcification was not detected in the new chordae. This reproducible and safe technique may considerably simplify the difficult repair of chordal abnormalities.\r"

Of these 65 patients with WG, 38 were ACPA positive. Two patients in the vasculitis group, best categorized as having microscopic polyarteritis, were ACPA positive. We obtained 125 serum samples from the 65 patients with WG and assigned them to one of two categories (limited or generalized), based on the extent of disease. Each of these categories was then subdivided into \"active\" or \"in remission.\" Median ACPA titers were significantly different between active disease and remission in each category, as well as between active limited and active generalized disease. All patients whose disease changed from active to in remission had reductions in ACPA titer levels; those who experienced flares had titer increases. Patients with intercurrent illnesses or complications of treatment, mimicking WG flares, did not have titer increases. We conclude that ACPA determined by the indirect immunofluorescence technique is highly specific for WG. The sensitivity is dependent on the extent and activity of WG, and serial titer determinations are valuable in monitoring disease activity.\r"

The questionnaire quickly proved to be useful and became, as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), the most widely used and thoroughly researched objective personality-assessment instrument. In 1959, the first computerized scoring and interpretative system for the MMPI was developed at the Mayo Clinic. During the 50 years that the MMPI has been used, however, our society has changed considerably. Therefore, a new normal contemporary reference sample of adults was obtained by Mayo Clinic investigators in 1983. Significant changes in response patterns were observed in comparison with the original norms, and new tables, based on normalized T scores rather than the linear transformation procedures of the past, were developed; these were incorporated into the Mayo Clinic MMPI scoring and interpretative system in 1984. Subsequently, a companion study of contemporary normal adolescents (691 girls and 624 boys) also showed significant changes in response patterns in comparison with the original norms. In addition, MMPI profiles from contemporary normal adolescents continue to differ from those of contemporary normal adults, similar to the differences noted between these two groups in the past. Data from these contemporary normal adolescents were used to develop new adolescent norms, which were incorporated into the Mayo Clinic scoring and interpretative system for the MMPI in January 1988.\r"

The two pathophysiologic types of this motility disorder are myopathic and neuropathic. The latter may affect extrinsic or intrinsic neural control of gut motility. Diagnosis is based on (1) recognition of the clinical syndrome and exclusion of mechanical obstruction by endoscopy, radiologic studies, or laparotomy and (2) manometric studies of the stomach and small bowel. Full-thickness biopsy specimens for histologic analysis may not be essential for the diagnosis in the future. The goals of treatment are the restoration of normal gut peristalsis and the correction of nutritional deficiencies. Prokinetic medications, surgical excision in cases of localized disease, and parenteral nutrition are frequently necessary. Management is difficult because of the lack of efficacious medications, extension of the disease to other regions, and complications of central parenteral nutrition. Prokinetic agents, venting enterostomies for relief of symptoms, and enteral supplementation are being evaluated in this intractable and serious condition.\r"

Recently, however, investigators have demonstrated that abnormalities of diastolic function of the heart provide important contributions to the signs and symptoms experienced by patients with heart disease. In addition, abnormalities of diastolic function may precede abnormalities of systolic function in the early stages of disease. Diastolic filling of the heart, however, is a complex sequence of interrelated events. In order to understand diastolic function, each of these factors contributing to filling of the heart must be examined. They include relaxation, passive compliance, atrial contraction, erectile effect of the coronary arteries, viscoelastic properties, ventricular interaction, and pericardial restraint--all of which are interrelated. In addition, diastolic factors are affected by changes in loading conditions and contractility, and they demonstrate nonuniformity in time and space. This report provides an overview of these various factors from the clinical perspective, based on studies involving the isolated papillary muscle and the isolated heart as well as basic clinical studies.\r"

The median operating time was 406 minutes, and the median usage of erythrocytes was 13.2 units. A venovenous bypass was used in all patients older than 10 years of age. Hepatic artery thrombosis occurred in 10% of the 100 transplants. A choledochocholedochostomy was done in 58 patients and a choledochojejunostomy in 25 patients. Revision of the biliary anastomosis was necessary in 9 of the 83 patients (11%). Rejection, diagnosed by clinical and histologic criteria, occurred in 50 patients (60%) and was treated with a corticosteroid bolus, followed by OKT3 (monoclonal antibody) treatment if necessary. Selective bowel decontamination helped prevent infections; only 16 bacteremias occurred, 1 of which was caused by a gram-negative organism. Fungal infections were rare. Cytomegalovirus infection occurred in 47 patients (57%). Of the 83 patients, 16 required retransplantation, in 11 of whom graft rejection had occurred. One- and 2-year patient survival was 83% and 70%, respectively. Although problems still remain, liver transplantation is a reasonable option for patients with end-stage liver disease.\r"

  ".W": "As is obvious from the previous discussions, obesity is associated with a wide variety of changes in endocrine parameters (Table 1). Some of these changes, such as the reduction in SHBG without change in serum free testosterone levels, reflect merely laboratory abnormalities that may influence interpretation of diagnostic tests but have no important physiologic relevance. Other abnormalities have major clinical impact, such as hyperestrogenemia-endometrial carcinoma and hyperlipidemia-coronary artery disease. In some cases, endocrine changes in obesity are beneficial--that is, hyperestrogenemia leading to lower incidence of osteoporosis. In other cases, such as the profound suppression of growth hormone output in obesity, the physiologic relevance is unknown. Several endocrine changes in obesity, such as the impaired response of many hormones (growth hormone, prolactin, vasopressin, corticotropin) to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and elevated endorphin levels, suggest hypothalamic dysfunction. Furthermore, the failure of all of these abnormalities to be normalized after weight reduction raises the possibility of an underlying disorder leading to both endocrine dysfunction and obesity, rather than the endocrine dysfunction being simply a consequence of the obesity. Successful elucidation of the pathogenesis of obesity, which might then lead to much needed specific treatment modalities, may be advanced if we can solve some of these puzzles.\r"

  ".W": "Much progress has been made in the development of behavioral programs in recent years. As a consequence, the behavioral approach now is integrated into most programs for weight loss. Because \"behavior modification\" is practiced so widely, there is a tendency to believe that it consists of little more than a series of techniques or tricks such as record keeping and slowing eating, and that programs do not vary much in how it is employed. This is mistaken. A modern day, comprehensive program is sophisticated and involves systematic work, not only on eating behavior, but on exercise, attitudes, social relationships, nutrition, and other factors. The better behavioral programs now are producing weight losses in the range of 25 to 30 lb. The greatest strength of the behavioral approach, however, lies in the maintenance of weight loss. This is an area where exciting developments are occurring. These developments are important, not only to clinicians and programs using behavior modification per se, but to professionals using nearly any approach to weight loss where the maintenance of loss is an issue. The horizon holds much promise for the potential of behavioral approaches, used alone or in combination with other treatments for obesity.\r"

  ".W": "Exercise training in obese patients increases cardiorespiratory fitness, reduces cardiovascular disease risk factors, and increases caloric expenditure; however, significant exercise is required to induce changes in body composition in the absence of caloric restriction, particularly for people whose exercise capacity may initially be limited. Unless a large amount of lean tissue is lost by concomitant dietary restriction, it is unlikely that resting metabolism is altered by exercise, either long-term, or acutely after each workout. The thermic effect of food is negatively related to body fat content. Exercise prior to a meal improves the blunted thermic response to food in the obese but does not normalize it completely. It is noteworthy that physical activity is self-determined and is the only component of energy expenditure that is under volitional control. Exercise alone, without caloric restriction, is probably insufficient to yield significant fat loss except in individuals who are extremely motivated, whereas the combination of modest caloric restriction and physical training of different modes may be necessary to induce favorable changes in body composition.\r"
