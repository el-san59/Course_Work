This article reviews the pathophysiology of pleural effusion and the role of intrapleural tetracycline in its management. Irritating chemicals, when instilled into the pleural space, are known to produce adhesion of the pleural membranes. Tetracycline has been shown in both animal and human studies to be effective in preventing the recurrence of a pleural effusion while producing only minor side effects, such as fever and pleuritic pain. Studies involving tetracycline in treating pleural effusions are reviewed, and guidelines for the preparation and administration of intrapleural tetracycline are presented. Because of its efficacy, low toxicity, ease of preparation, ready availability, and low cost, tetracycline deserves strong consideration as a first-line agent in the management of recurrent pleural effusions.\r"

As a result we have proposed that failure of cure with single-dose treatment may be the most specific test available to diagnose renal infection. Most of the published data on single-dose therapy involves treatment with either amoxicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Single-dose therapy offers advantages over traditional therapy, including improved compliance, reduced adverse effects, and decreased cost. Appropriate patient selection is critical if the outcome of single-dose therapy is to be effective.\r"

Risk factors that further predispose patients to DVT include obesity, age over 40 years, smoking, dehydration, and a prior history of thromboembolism. Diagnosis of DVT by physical examination and medical history is difficult; objective diagnostic techniques are often required. Considerable emphasis has been placed on the cost-effectiveness of implementing prophylactic measures in patients who are at high risk for developing DVT. Physical maneuvers attempt to reduce stasis and enhance venous return and pharmacologic approaches alter blood coagulability. The drug therapy used in preventing DVT consists of dextran, low-dose heparin, a combination of low-dose heparin and dihydroergotamine, and warfarin. Effective prophylactic regimens differ according to the type of patients at risk. Prophylactic therapy should be tailored according to the patient's disease and degree of risk.\r"

  ".W": "The benefits of treating hypertension have been documented by several long-term studies that have shown a decreased incidence of morbidity and mortality associated with stroke, left ventricular failure, and renal insufficiency. With the large number of antihypertensive drugs currently available, several safety factors need to be considered when initially choosing a regimen so as not to adversely influence the potential benefits of blood pressure control. Antihypertensive agents should be chosen based on their hemodynamic profile, the absence of adverse metabolic effects and subjective side effects, and the presence of beneficial effects on the patients' quality of life. Thiazide diuretics and beta-blocking agents have often been recommended as initial therapy in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. However, thiazide diuretics may be less desirable in certain patients because of their effects on lipids, potassium, and glucose tolerance; beta-blocking agents are not ideal for some patients because of their effects on lipids, exercise tolerance, and overall quality of life. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, selective alpha 1-blocking agents, and calcium channel blocking agents may be more appropriate for initial therapy of hypertension in many patients.\r"

Since the discovery of the therapeutic potentials of naturally isolated somatostatins, attempts have been made to design newer analogs more conducive to practical use. Such an example is long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide. Literature has recently begun to appear describing the therapeutic activities of this and other similar compounds and the first steps to understanding their clinical pharmacology are being taken. Surprising activity has been found in the palliative treatment of a wide variety of formerly resistant gastrointestinal syndromes and endocrine tumors. These activities may have considerable future impact on the treatment of disease involving hormonal imbalance or inappropriate secretion.\r"

Although its clinical presentation is protean and often ambiguous, risk stratification can be accomplished based on the predictive power of a limited number of physical and historical characteristics. Ventilation-perfusion lung scanning occupies a central position in the work-up of suspected PE; however, evidence exists that it may be misused by many physicians. A low probability V-Q scan does not exclude the diagnosis of PE. Patients with other than normal- or high-probability patterns of pulmonary ventilation and perfusion on lung scanning require further investigation. Noninvasive venous studies are useful when indicative of proximal deep venous thrombosis, but are normal in many patients with acute PE. Heparin remains the standard of treatment for most patients with PE. Vena cava filters effectively reduce the incidence of recurrent PE in patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. Thrombolytic therapy offers potential advantages in the treatment of patients with shock due to their PE. Case reports of PE treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator, a new thrombus-specific fibrinolytic agent, are encouraging but preliminary.\r"

It is clear that the seasoned physician's instinct (the sum total of the history, physician examination, and ancillary laboratory tests) is as good an indicator as existing statistical decision models. Current decision rules appear most helpful as teaching aids for physicians-in-training and for providing reassurance to seasoned physicians. Although ancillary tests such as echocardiography and rapid myoglobin analysis may play more important roles in the future, emergency physicians must now rely primarily upon their clinical impression to guide admission decisions. Vigorous attempts to minimize the admission of patients without ischemia to the CCU will increase the incidence of infarction patients released from the Emergency Department. The liberal use of intermediate care unit beds may represent one future disposition alternative. Nonetheless, each physician must establish his or her own threshold for admission. Several studies have found a 5 per cent unintentional release of infarction patients from the Emergency Department. Decreasing the admission threshold may lower this rate substantially. Patients with chest discomfort who are released from the Emergency Department require close followup. At urban teaching hospitals, where private physician referral is often limited, the institution may need to establish a clinic specifically for this purpose. Unrecognized myocardial ischemia is one rationale for close followup; however, the pursuit of alternative diagnoses including gastrointestinal and psychiatric (e.g., panic disorders) etiologies may minimize subsequent morbidity in the released population.\r"

At this time, the beta-blocking agents and nitroglycerin have been the most extensively studied in clinical trials and should be part of our overall pharmacologic approach to patients with acute myocardial infarction. Treatment, however, needs to be individualized, depending on the resources available within one's hospital and community. The early treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction is undergoing a revolution. Whereas a decade ago we were satisfied with simply monitoring patients for malignant arrhythmias, now we are aggressively attempting to limit infarct size and reperfuse myocardium. In all these proposed treatments for myocardial salvage, time is a crucial element. Therefore, emergency physicians and paramedics become a vital link to begin appropriate treatment leading to myocardial salvage and reperfusion. We must begin to think of all patients with symptoms of acute myocardial infarction as candidates for aggressive attempts at myocardial salvage. These attempts will only take place with well-coordinated, multidiscipline efforts involving cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, emergency physicians, paramedics, and critical care teams. Our challenge over the next few years will be to develop efficient systems so that all patients with acute myocardial infarction can receive optimal care.\r"

Their last seizure was at least 3 months prior to entry, and no patient had any clinical evidence of toxicity. They were randomized to study arm A (keeping the level in the subtherapeutic range) or study arm B (increasing the dose until the level reached and stayed at the therapeutic range). Over a mean follow-up period of 24 months, there was no significant difference between the two study arms in the occurrence of seizures, but arm B patients had an increased incidence of neurotoxic side effects from the dose increment. These results confirm the clinical impression that it is unnecessary to increase the dose of the antiepileptic drug despite a subtherapeutic serum concentration in a relatively well-stabilized patient, thus minimizing the frequency of dose adjustment and the need for expensive therapeutic drug monitoring.\r"

Neurophysiologic and behavioral measures of the effects of treatment were made using electroencephalogram (EEG)-video equipment. Effects of treatment were assessed by using a random sample of EEG-video sequences in base rate and follow-up. Results showed that no significant reduction of either seizure behavior or paroxysmal EEG activity was found subsequent to training in discrimination of early paroxysmal activity and/or sensations preceding seizures. Both seizure behavior and paroxysmal activity were significantly reduced in all three cases following intervention with an adapted countermeasure technique. No additional effects could be noted subsequent to the application of either contingent relaxation or positive reinforcement for correct responses. Paroxysmal EEG changes and seizure behavior were highly correlated. Reduction of the clinical manifestation or seizure response by behavioral manipulation was accompanied by a reduction of the total amount of paroxysmal activity as measured by the EEG.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred thirty-seven patients with fulminant hepatic failure were entered into two controlled trials of charcoal hemoperfusion carried out concurrently. In trial A, 75 patients with grade 3 encephalopathy were randomized to receive 5 or 10 h of hemoperfusion daily. Overall survival rates for the two groups were similar (51.3% vs. 50.0%) as was the frequency of major complications including cerebral edema and renal failure. In trial B, in which 62 patients with established grade 4 encephalopathy on admission were randomized to a no-perfusion group or to have 10 h of hemoperfusion daily, overall survival rates for the two groups were again similar (39.3% and 34.5%, respectively). There was in both trials a significant relationship between survival and etiology quite independent of the use or duration of hemoperfusion. Thus, percentage survival for the acetaminophen-overdose cases was 52.9%, for hepatitis A 66.7%, for hepatitis B 38.9%, for presumed non-A, non-B hepatitis 20%, and for halothane or drug reaction 12.5%. Within the etiologic subgroups survival was also influenced by the three major complications that developed, being inversely related to their frequency and combination, except in the non-A, non-B hepatitis and halothane or drug reaction subgroups, which had a high mortality throughout. In the latter cases particularly, orthotopic liver transplantation merits early consideration and in the group with better \"intrinsic\" survival (acetaminophen, hepatitis A and B) intensive management of complications (rather than charcoal hemoperfusion) would appear to be of major importance.\r"

The purpose of this report is to present our experience with liver transplantation for primary biliary cirrhosis. Attention is given to the causes of hepatic dysfunction seen in allografts. In addition, we review the postoperative problems encountered and the quality of life at time of last follow-up in patients with transplants for primary biliary cirrhosis. A total of 97 orthotopic liver transplant procedures were performed in 76 patients with advanced primary biliary cirrhosis at the University of Pittsburgh from March 1980 through September 1985. The transplant operation was relatively easy to perform. The most common technical complications experienced were fragmentation and intramural dissection of the recipient hepatic artery, which required an arterial graft in 20% of the cases. Most of the postoperative mortality occurred in the first 6 mo after transplantation, with an essentially flat actuarial life survival curve from that time point to a projected 5-yr survival of 66%. Common causes of death included rejection and primary graft nonfunction. Thirteen of the 76 patients had some hepatic dysfunction at the time of the last follow-up, although none were jaundiced. Recurrence of primary biliary cirrhosis could not be demonstrated in any of the patients. Antimitochondrial antibody was detected in the serum of almost all of the patients studied postoperatively for it. Most important, almost all of the 52 surviving patients have been rehabilitated socially and vocationally.\r"

A tumor of the pancreas was usually visualized as a hypoechoic mass that had a characteristic image depending on the size. Ultrasonographic differentiation of malignant from benign tumors of the pancreas was possible in tumors larger than 30 mm in size but difficult in tumors less than 20 mm in size. Compared with conventional ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, computed tomography, and angiography, endoscopic ultrasonography had the highest detection rate of tumors of the pancreas, especially in cases of small tumors under 20 mm in size. In cancer of the pancreas, endoscopic ultrasonography also proved to be valuable for the detection of vascular invasion.\r"

Associated with the microcolonies of bacteria was a collection of amorphous material forming a dense concretion on the surface of the stent. This phenomenon was not observed in experiments using sterile bile or with infected bile sterilized by formalin treatment or autoclaving.

A brief overview of diagnostic testing methods suitable for the elderly and medical and surgical management options is presented.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism by which monoclonal antibodies directed against human renin (R3-36-16 and R3-47-10) inhibit renin activity was investigated using various substrates. Both antibodies acted as potent inhibitors of human renin activity when human angiotensinogen was used as a substrate. However, their effects differed clearly in the presence of synthetic tetradecapeptide. When low concentrations of tetradecapeptide were used as substrate, renin activity was only partially inhibited by R3-47-10, whereas it was stimulated by R3-36-16. At higher synthetic substrate concentrations, both antibodies stimulated angiotensin I production. This effect was independent of the pH. Both antibodies exerted their effects in the presence of CGP 29287, a peptidic transition-state competitive renin inhibitor, indicating that their binding sites differed from that of CGP 29287. In combination, the stimulatory effect of R3-36-16 was not blocked by R3-47-10, but the inhibition produced by R3-47-10 was reversed by R3-36-16. Both antibodies may prevent the large natural substrate angiotensinogen from entering the enzymatic cleft by steric hindrance. At a low substrate concentration, R3-47-10 may also partially hinder the access of synthetic tetradecapeptide into the active cleft by steric hindrance. In contrast, the stimulating effect of both antibodies may be due to a conformational change in the renin molecule, allowing an increased access of tetradecapeptide or a more rapid release of the product from the enzymatic cleft.\r"

Data were recorded in each of nine dogs under three conditions: 1) during a baseline control interval, 2) during renal artery stenosis, and 3) during stenosis with intravenous injection of captopril (1.2 mg/kg). Mean arterial blood pressure was 108 +/- 12 mm Hg at control, increased significantly to 125 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) during stenosis, and decreased to 98 +/- 13 mm/Hg (p less than 0.01) after captopril infusion. Mean renal blood flow was calculated using a steady state single compartment model from the images produced by positron emission tomography. The estimated flow to the affected kidney was 3.37 +/- 1.48 ml/min/g at control, 0.86 +/- 0.62 ml/min/g during stenosis (p less than 0.01), and 0.64 +/- 0.57 ml/min/g after captopril administration (p = NS compared with precaptopril value). The estimated flow to the contralateral kidney was minimally reduced from a baseline of 3.84 +/- 0.95 to 3.24 +/- 1.13 ml/min/g (p = NS) during stenosis and increased after captopril infusion (4.08 +/- 0.94 ml/min/g; p = 0.01). These data suggest that repetitive imaging with positron emission tomography can be used to delineate acute changes in renal perfusion following captopril administration.\r"

High performance liquid chromatography clearly demonstrated the presence of angiotensin I (Ang I), angiotensin II (Ang II), and a small amount of angiotensin III. The spontaneous release of irAng II was as high as about 600 pg/30 min, which was stable up to 3 hours. Captopril added to the perfusion medium (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) suppressed irAng II release in a dose-dependent manner (p less than 0.001), and it (10(-6)M) caused a reciprocal increase of irAng I release (p less than 0.05). Oral pretreatment of captopril (50 mg/kg/day) for 1 week suppressed the irAng II release by 31% (p less than 0.02). The same treatment with SA 446, a highly lipophilic angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, inhibited the irAng II release by 63% (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, the two inhibitors suppressed the plasma irAng II to very similar extents. Pretreatment with SA 446 plus nephrectomy did not cause any further change in irAng II release as compared with that with SA 446 alone. These results provide direct proof for local generation and subsequent secretion of Ang II by peripheral vascular tissue.\r"

For this study, we used a bradykinin analogue, D-Arg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-DPhe-Thi-Arg-TFA, with in vivo antagonistic properties. Hypertensive rats were infused intra-aortically for 15 minutes with either saline (30 microliters/min) or the kinin antagonist (40 micrograms/kg/min). Five minutes after the infusion was begun, a bolus injection of enalaprilat (60 micrograms/kg) was given. The blood pressure of the saline-infused animals decreased 48 +/- 6 mm Hg (from 180 +/- 7 to 132 +/- 7 mm Hg), while that of the rats treated with the antagonist decreased only 21 +/- 4 mm Hg (from 175 +/- 3 to 154 +/- 3 mm Hg).

In another group of hypertensive animals (n = 9), we measured kinin concentration in plasma from arterial blood before and after administration of CEI (41 +/- 10 vs 68 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively; NS). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that kinins play a role in the acute antihypertensive effect of CEIs in rats with severe hypertension. However, since arterial blood kinin concentrations were not increased significantly after CEI administration, the effect of the CEI may be due to an increase in tissue kinins, which could act as autacoids regulating vascular resistance.\r"

The results indicated that patients with hypertension had significantly higher than normal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in both situations. Furthermore, when dietary carbohydrate was increased by 16% of total calories (with a reciprocal reduction in dietary fat), the hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia present in patients with hypertension were accentuated. Since low fat-high carbohydrate diets are usually recommended for patients with hypertension, these data suggest that abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism associated with hypertension would be increased if patients with high blood pressure followed conventional dietary advice. Since hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia have been shown to be associated with an increased risk of developing coronary artery disease, it may be appropriate to reevaluate the clinical utility of low fat-high carbohydrate diets in the treatment of hypertension.\r"

Problems arise in comparing studies since, in addition to other methodological differences, the readings obtained with the random-zero sphygmomanometer have been found to be lower than those obtained with the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. In the present study, blood pressures were measured in 66 subjects to examine the comparability of findings with the two instruments. Trained observers measured blood pressures simultaneously using a double-headed stethoscope and one cuff connected to the two sphygmomanometers. Use of instrument was randomly assigned for each blood pressure measurement; each observer was unaware of the other's blood pressure reading. Readings were lower with the random-zero sphygmomanometer; mean difference ranged from 2.5 to 3.3 mm Hg for systolic pressure and 1.9 to 2.7 mm Hg for diastolic pressure. Digit distributions recorded by the two observers for the standard mercury sphygmomanometer and the random-zero sphygmomanometer were not significantly different for either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Intraindividual variation was greater with the random-zero sphygmomanometer than with the standard mercury sphygmomanometer. These data do not indicate that one instrument is clearly superior to the other, although in studies where the observer seeks to reduce the bias of multiple readings per person, the random-zero sphygmomanometer may be the more appropriate instrument. Critical to the use of either instrument are careful training, standardization, certification, and periodic recertification of observers.\r"

A variety of clinical trials, designed to examine the benefit of blood pressure reduction in decreasing morbidity and mortality from hypertension-related cardiovascular disease, have surprisingly failed to show a decrease in coronary artery disease death rate, although other forms of vascular disease were impressively reduced. These trials have consistently used diuretics as the initial therapeutic choice. Such observations have stimulated a reevaluation of the \"stepped-care\" approach and a critical appraisal of diuretic effects. This review examines the efficacy of diuretics in reducing blood pressure and attempts to identify individuals most likely to respond to these agents. The side effects of diuretic therapy are reviewed in hemodynamic, cardiac, metabolic, and symptomatic terms, but because some of these aspects of diuretic or antihypertensive therapy are detailed elsewhere in this monograph, the present discussion focuses on cardiac, metabolic, hemodynamic, and symptomatic effects. Finally, alternative therapeutic options and guidelines for therapy are outlined.\r"

Adverse effects of the first type include bronchospasm, heart failure, prolonged hypoglycemia, bradycardia, heart block, intermittent claudication, and Raynaud's phenomenon. Neurological reactions include depression, fatigue, and nightmares. It is not yet proven whether the beta 1-selective adrenergic blockers or those with partial agonist activity reduce the overall frequency of adverse reactions seen with propranolol. Patient age does not appear, in itself, to be associated with more beta-blocker side effects. Side effects of the second category are rare. They include an unusual oculomucocutaneous reaction and the possibility of oncogenesis. There are also many drugs that interact with beta-blockers, which may increase toxicity. Finally, there are specific patient characteristics where one beta-blocker may be more effective and safer than another.\r"

Most prominent among undesirable side effects are the central nervous system findings of sedation, altered thought process, depression, and orthostatic or exercise hypotension. Sexual problems, especially in men, are also prominent. Special toxicity is discussed with reference to methyldopa, clonidine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and metyrosine.\r"

Indomethacin has been shown to abrogate the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers, diuretics, converting enzyme inhibitors, and several antihypertensive drug combinations, and the accumulated evidence on piroxicam indicates that it also raises arterial pressure in treated patients. In contrast, sulindac and aspirin do not reverse the effects of antihypertensive drugs, and currently available data indicate that they are the safest cyclooxygenase inhibitors for use in hypertensive patients. In the absence of definitive information on the array of other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, they should be considered to pose a risk similar to indomethacin until proved otherwise. The magnitude of the elevation in blood pressure varies between patients, ranging from no effect to dangerous hypertensive responses. Generalized inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme has opposing effects on arterial pressure, lowering renin on one hand and causing sodium retention on the other. Some evidence suggests that cyclooxygenase inhibition causes the greater increments in pressure in patients who initially have low plasma renin activity (often the elderly). The potential for cerebral vascular catastrophes attends these drug interactions in which platelet function also is suppressed by cyclooxygenase inhibition.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel blocking drugs are a chemically heterogenous group, so it might be expected that their effects on vascular smooth muscle, cardiac contractility, and conduction tissue may differ. However, the majority of adverse reactions are predictable from their pharmacological actions and may be conveniently grouped in the following categories: 1) vasodilatation, 2) negative inotropic effects, 3) conduction disturbances, 4) gastrointestinal effects, 5) metabolic effects, and 6) drug interactions. Vasodilatory symptoms, namely, dizziness, headaches, flushing sensation, and palpitation, are more likely with nifedipine. Peripheral edema is also common with nifedipine, but the mechanism is uncertain. For a given degree of vasodilation, the greatest negative inotropic effect is seen with verapamil first, diltiazem second, and nifedipine last. Calcium channel blocking drugs are contraindicated in hypertensive patients with second and third degree heart block, sick sinus syndrome, and severe heart failure. Verapamil and diltiazem have a significant effect on cardiac conduction, whereas nifedipine, in therapeutic doses, does not. Local gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and constipation, are common with verapamil. None of the calcium channel blocking drugs have been reported to adversely affect lipid or protein metabolism. However, nifedipine, verapamil, and diltiazem in high doses may inhibit liberation of insulin. The significance of this finding needs to be explored further in hypertensive diabetics. Serum digoxin levels have been shown to increase after administration of verapamil and nifedipine, but there is no evidence that this change has any clinical relevance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Risk of sudden death was increased threefold in hypertensive persons but only if there was no previously diagnosed coronary heart disease. Men receiving antihypertensive treatment had more than twice the risk of sudden death compared with those who were untreated, whether or not they had prior manifestations of coronary heart disease. More than twice as many men who died suddenly were receiving antihypertensive therapy compared with those in the population at risk of the same age. In those with overt coronary heart disease, 34% of those dying suddenly were on antihypertensive treatment compared with 18% of those of the same age in the general population. Multivariate analysis taking into account the level of blood pressure, electrocardiographic abnormalities, and previously diagnosed coronary heart disease and cardiac failure, all of which are predisposing factors for sudden death, indicated a persistent increased risk of sudden death in association with antihypertensive treatment. Tests of interaction indicate that the excess sudden death risk was not confined to those with electrocardiographic abnormalities. In women, it may be associated with diabetes. These data suggest that some feature of antihypertensive treatment as practiced in the general population may contribute to sudden death incidence in an ill-defined subgroup of hypertensive persons.\r"

General issues of compliance are a necessary background to specific issues of compliance with regimens for single diseases such as hypertension. The definition of compliance continues to be modified, and examination of past work reveals certain consistencies in studies of compliance. Non-compliance is higher in chronic conditions, in activities requiring change in life-style, and in clinician-initiated visits. Noncomprehension of instructions is held to be the most frequent cause of noncompliance. Noncompliance is a threat to the course of treatment, increases unnecessary diagnostic procedures, and confounds evaluation of effectiveness. Factors related to compliance have been identified with regard to certain patient and disease characteristics, amount of support in the immediate environment, and the nature of the doctor-patient relationship. Older patients are often at greater risk in understanding regimens because clinicians educate this group less often, because symptoms are misunderstood by both patient and provider, and because of greater complexity in both conditions that are being treated and number of drugs and other aspects of treatment required. Methods of improving the doctor-patient relationship have been urged most recently as a means through which compliance can be increased.\r"

Furthermore, even when patients stay in treatment, they often take their medications in a way quite dissimilar from that prescribed. Identifying noncompliant patients is important but not always easy to accomplish. Pill counts, the \"gold standard,\" are seldom practical in routine clinical practice. Assessing compliance by its biological effect is compromised by physiological diversity among patients. Assessing compliance from patient self-reports is limited in its accuracy but is more useful than many researchers and clinicians appreciate. Compliance behavior is affected by many factors. Complexity of medical regimen has some effect; the presence of drug side effects has surprisingly little. Contrary to what many clinicians think, increased age is often accompanied by increased medication compliance. Features of the doctor-patient relationship likely have an important effect on patient compliance, though our knowledge of these factors is still limited.\r"

As such, it has the potential to interact with other drugs to produce toxic reactions, especially in treated hypertensive patients. Complications have occurred with single oral doses that suggest some normal subjects may be more sensitive to the drug than others. The incidence of serious complications in the general population is small but could be much higher in susceptible individuals (e.g., cardiomyopathic and hypertensive patients). The availability of high-dose phenylpropanolamine-containing preparations without medical supervision is potentially dangerous, and certain restrictions should be imposed on such preparations.\r"

In the majority of cases, apparent resistance is more likely associated with poor patient adherence, interacting drugs, drug interactions, and inappropriate drug dosages. Sodium and fluid volume play a major role in resistant hypertension. There is considerable evidence to support the role of dietary sodium restriction in successful nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension. Salt sensitivity in humans appears to represent at least one factor determining individual susceptibility to variable salt intakes. Sodium and water retention may lead to refractoriness to many antihypertensive agents, and there is evidence to suggest that extracellular fluid volume expansion also plays a role in many hypertensive patients. While retention of sodium and water is well established early in patients with renal parenchymal disease, hypertension associated with progression of renal parenchymal disease is complicated by other factors that include interactions between hemodynamic and humoral factors, functional changes in adrenergic responses, and structural vascular disease. The role of other cations such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium in resistant hypertension has yet to be established.\r"

The first step recommended in the identification of such patients is to use home blood pressure monitoring. If home blood pressures are low, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure recording is indicated. If this also gives low readings, it is appropriate to treat patients according to their level of home blood pressure. Because of the unreliability of clinic pressures, ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring may also be of value in assessing the response to treatment.\r"

Fifty patients were randomly assigned to have cardiac output measured by the capped syringe or closed loop method, and were followed with quantitative cultures of fluid and catheter. The two treatment groups (n = 25 each) were comparable in terms of age, sex, intensive care unit location, underlying diagnosis, and mean number of cardiac output determinations performed in the first 24 hours after placement of the catheter line. No differences in the rates of fluid contamination were seen at any time between the two groups. The overall fluid contamination rate was 2/124 cultures (1.8% with 95% confidence interval +/- 4.1%) with one colony of Staphylococcus epidermidis from a closed loop sample and one colony of Pseudomonas maltophilia in a capped syringe sample. Although no difference in contamination rates was documented, the closed loop system required less nursing time and effort.\r"

It is imperative that acute care nurses understand the dynamics of this phenomenon to provide effective preventive and supportive care for these patients. In this article are outlined recommendations for this care. Preventing acute orthostatic hypotension entails careful assessment of the status of the patient's sympathetic reflexes and assisting these reflexes to gain maximal control over peripheral vasoconstriction before the patient leaves bed. Supportive care during the patient's early experiences out of bed involves measures to reduce the likelihood of acute orthostatic hypotension, careful assessment of parameters that signal impending syncope, and immediate assistance for the patient who does experience it. On the patient's return to bed, evaluation of the patient's tolerance level assists in planning the patient's next venture out of bed.\r"

This syndrome is characterized by myocardial ischemia without the typical anginal pain. Diagnosis must be specific, with the use of objective evidence of ischemic changes provided by ambulatory monitoring or exercise stress testing. It is the purpose of this article to review the current literature for the prognosis, the population at risk, and the recommended therapies for these patients. ACAD appears to occur in three different types of individuals. A type 1 person is totally asymptomatic, has no history of angina, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure, and demonstrates myocardial ischemia. The type 2 patient with ACAD is in the postmyocardial infarction period and demonstrates asymptomatic myocardial ischemia. The type 3 patient with ACAD is one who experiences myocardial ischemia both with and without pain. Nursing needs to provide support and guidance for the ACAD patient and family. Common nursing diagnoses have been outlined to assist in planning the care of this patient population.\r"

We, therefore, measured antibodies to a variety of nuclear antigens in 20 patients with Graves' disease, most of whom where hyperthyroid. Fluorescent antinuclear antibody tests using HEp-2 cells as substrate were positive in serum of 15 of the 20 patients but in only 2 of 20 normal subjects. DNA binding, determined by RIA, was increased in 12 of 18 patients with Graves' disease. However, a more specific indirect immunofluorescence assay for antibodies to double-stranded DNA using Crithidia luciliae was negative in all 20 patients. Furthermore, antibodies to single-stranded DNA, measured by counterimmunoelectrophoresis, and ribonucleoprotein and Sm antigens, measured by double diffusion in agar, were undetectable in all patients tested. These results demonstrate a high frequency of antinuclear antibody in patients with Graves' disease. The presence of antibodies to double-stranded DNA was not confirmed when assayed by the highly specific and sensitive Crithidia luciliae method, suggesting nonantibody DNA binding in the DNA RIA.\r"

  ".W": "Several techniques are now available for quantitation of bone mass, including total body calcium by neutron activation analysis (TBC), single and dual photon absorptiometry at the radius and spine, respectively (SPA and DPA), quantitative computed tomography of the spine (QCT), and cancellous bone volume from iliac crest bone biopsies. The aims of this study were to assess the correlation among these techniques and to determine if bone mass correlated with height loss or the severity of vertebral fractures in osteoporotic women. These measurements were performed in the same group of women (n = 122) with postmenopausal osteoporosis. TBC, SPA, DPA, and QCT correlated significantly with each other (r = 0.33-0.76). The correlation between QCT and DPA improved significantly (r = 0.33-0.57; P = 0.02) when integral QCT was used instead of the usual QCT of the central vertebra. The correlation was not improved by expressing DPA in different dimensions, but was improved by including normal women. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that TBC was predicted better using SPA, DPA, and QCT than by any single variable. Cancellous bone volume correlated weakly (r = 0.10-0.26) to the other measurements. Height loss and fracture index correlated significantly with each other (r = 0.66; P less than 0.001), but the correlations with bone mass measurements were weak (r = -0.09 to -0.47). For each patient, a bone mass index was defined using z scores from the SPA, DPA, QCT, and TBC measurements; this index correlated inversely with the fracture index (r = -0.29; P = 0.009). This correlation was not significant when controlled for age. Thus, bone mass measurements correlate moderately well with each other, but poorly with severity of fracture. Other factors in addition to low bone mass may be important in determining whether bone will fracture.\r"

  ".W": "Eight hyperthyroid and eight normal subjects underwent 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) and euglycemic clamp studies to assess the presence of peripheral and hepatic insulin antagonism in hyperthyroidism. Although the mean total glucose area during the OGTT was similar in the hyperthyroid patients and normal subjects [16.4 +/- 0.8 (+/- SE) vs. 15.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L.h], the mean insulin area was significantly elevated in the hyperthyroid group (1413 +/- 136 vs. 1004 +/- 122 pmol/L.h; P less than 0.05). Basal hepatic glucose production was measured during the second hour of a primed [3-3H]glucose infusion. A two-insulin dose euglycemic clamp study with [3-3H]glucose and somatostatin (500 micrograms/h) was carried out during the next 6 h. The insulin infusion rate was 0.05 mU/kg.min during the third, fourth, and fifth hours and 0.60 mU/kg.min during the sixth, seventh, and eighth hours. Hepatic glucose production and glucose utilization were measured during the final 0.5 h of each clamp period. Serum C-peptide concentrations were measured in the initial sample and in the last sample of each clamp period. The mean equilibrium serum insulin concentrations were similar in both groups during the final 0.5 h of the low (90 +/- 8 vs. 79 +/- 6 pmol/L) and high (367 +/- 11 vs. 367 +/- 15 pmol/L) insulin infusion rates. Basal serum C-peptide levels were significantly increased in the hyperthyroid patients (596 +/- 17 vs. 487 +/- 43 pmol/L; P less than 0.05) but were suppressed equally in both groups at the end of both clamp periods. The MCRs of insulin were similar in the hyperthyroid and normal subjects during the low (6.7 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.5 mL/kg.min) and high (11.9 +/- 0.4 vs. 12.1 +/- 0.5 mL/kg.mm) insulin infusion rates. Glucose production was significantly increased in the hyperthyroid patients during the basal state (17.6 +/- 0.9 vs. 11.5 +/- 0.5 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001) and remained elevated during the final 0.5 h of the low (12.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 5.9 +/- 1.7; P less than 0.01) and high (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.3; P less than 0.05) insulin infusion rates. Peripheral insulin action, assessed by Bergman's sensitivity index, was significantly decreased in the hyperthyroid patients (7.4 +/- 2.2 vs. 15.6 +/- 2.1 L/kg min-1/pmol/L; P less than 0.02). In conclusion, hyperthyroidism is characterized by 1) hyperinsulinemia after oral glucose loading, 2) increased basal hepatic glucose production, 3) impairment of insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose production, and 4) antagonism to insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose utilization.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effects of presynaptic dopamine (DA) 2 receptor blockade on the sympathetic-adrenal response to graded exercise in seven normal men. DA2 receptor blockade was achieved by means of domperidone (DMP) administration. The exercise consisted of progressive cycling activity, from 30-80% of the predetermined maximal oxygen consumption for each man. Systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures; heart rate; and plasma norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), PRL, glucose, lactate, FFA, sodium, potassium, cortisol, and PRA were measured at rest, during exercise, and during recovery after placebo or DMP administration. Graded exercise caused significant increases in systolic and mean arterial pressures and plasma NE, E, lactate, sodium, potassium, FFA, cortisol, and PRA. DMP administration before exercise caused a significant increase in plasma PRL (P = 0.0009), a greater increase in plasma NE at the end of the exercise (P = 0.002), and an overall increase in plasma E (P = 0.02) and FFA (P = 0.02) concentrations. These results strongly suggest that endogenous DA limits catecholamine release during sympathetic-adrenal stimulation by activating DA2 receptors.\r"

Monoclonal antibody 10E5, which inhibits binding of fibronectin and von Willebrand factor to the platelet membrane glycoprotein GPIIb-GPIIIa complex, inhibited the binding of mouse CT26 and human HCT8 colon carcinoma cells to platelets by 63-65%, whereas an irrelevant monoclonal antibody, 3B2, had no effect. Monoclonal antibody 6D1, which inhibits binding of von Willebrand factor to GPIb, also had no effect. RGDS, a tetrapeptide that represents the adhesive domain of fibronectin and von Willebrand factor inhibited binding of the tumors to platelets by 64-69%. Monospecific polyclonal antifibronectin antibody inhibited binding by 60-82%; anti-von Willebrand factor antibody inhibited binding by 75-81%. In vivo, polyclonal monospecific anti-mouse von Willebrand factor antibody inhibited pulmonary metastases induced by CT26 tumor cells by 53-64%, B16a amelanotic melanoma cells by 45% and T241 Lewis bladder cells by 46% without induction of thrombocytopenia. Pulmonary metastases with CT26 cells could be inhibited by induction of thrombocytopenia, and reconstituted by infusion of either murine or human platelets. Reconstitution of pulmonary metastases with human platelets could be inhibited 77% by preincubation of human platelets with monoclonal antibody 10E5 before infusion of platelets into mice. Thus, platelets appear to contribute to metastases by their adhesive interaction with tumor cells via the adhesive proteins fibronectin and von Willebrand factor.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the biological quality and physiologically pulsatile mode of endogenous luteinizing hormone release in active, healthy aging men, we used the rat interstitial-cell testosterone in vitro bioassay to probe LH bioactivity in response to (a) endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) action (basal pulsatile bioactive LH secretion); (b) exogenous GnRH stimulation (10 micrograms IV pulses); and (c) inhibition of endogenous estrogen negative feedback (treatment with a nonsteroidal antiestrogen, tamoxifen). Basally, some healthy older men exhibited evidence of neuroendocrine dysfunction, reflected by irregular bursts of bioactive LH release followed by transiently low plasma bio:immuno (B:I) LH ratios. However, mean basal plasma bioactive LH concentrations, B:I ratios, and spontaneous LH pulse properties (peak frequency, amplitude, duration, and enhanced B:I ratios within LH peaks) were not altered in older men. On the other hand, augmentation of bioactive LH secretion and enhancement of plasma B:I ratios by pulsed injections of exogenous GnRH were either significantly reduced or absent in older men. In addition, although tamoxifen increased bioactive LH pulse frequency in both age groups and facilitated exogenous GnRH action in some subjects, older men increased their 12-h mean bioactive LH concentrations, B:I ratios, and bioactive LH peak amplitudes to a significantly lesser degree than young men. In summary, young and older healthy men exhibit similar mean basal plasma bioactive LH concentrations and spontaneous LH pulse properties. However, pituitary bioactive LH reserve is markedly attenuated in older men challenged with either exogenous GnRH or antiestrogen. Accordingly, we conclude that healthy aging men manifest an impaired secretory reserve for biologically active LH release.\r"

The effects of CSF-1 are mediated through binding to specific, high-affinity surface receptors encoded by the c-fms gene. CSF-1 and c-fms gene expression was investigated in fresh human acute myeloblastic leukemic cells by Northern blot hybridization using cDNA probes. 4.0-kb CSF-1 transcripts were detected in 10 of 17 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), while c-fms transcripts were detected in 7 of 15. Coexpression of CSF-1 and c-fms was observed in five cases, and in five other cases neither gene was expressed. In situ hybridization demonstrated that transcripts for CSF-1 were present in 70-90% of cells in each of three cases studied while c-fms mRNA was detected in 40-70% of cells. The constitutive expression of CSF-1 transcripts was associated with production of CSF-1 protein, although detectable amounts of CSF-1 were not secreted unless the cells were exposed to phorbol ester. These results demonstrate that leukemic myeloblasts from a subset of patients with AML express transcripts for both the CSF-1 and CSF-1 receptor genes, often in the same leukemic cells in vitro.\r"

Neutral endopeptidase (NEP) is an important modulator of substance P-induced responses. To test the hypothesis that exposure to TDI would increase responsiveness to substance P by inhibiting activity of this enzyme, we determined the dose of substance P required to increase pulmonary resistance by 200% above baseline (PD200) before and after administration of the pharmacologic inhibitor phosphoramidon in guinea pigs studied 1 h after a 1-h exposure to air or 3 ppm TDI. TDI exposure increased responsiveness to substance P significantly. However, phosphoramidon caused a significantly greater leftward shift of the substance P dose-response curve in air-exposed animals than it did in TDI-exposed animals, so that after phosphoramidon, mean values of PD200 in animals exposed to air or TDI did not differ. Tracheal NEP activity was significantly less after exposure to TDI than after exposure to air, whereas activity in the esophagus was the same in both groups. These results suggest that TDI exposure increases the bronchoconstrictor responsiveness of guinea pigs to substance P, in large part through inhibition of airway NEP.\r"

Upon binding of 3F8, a murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for GD2, neuroblastomas and some melanomas are sensitive to killing by human complement, whereas some melanomas are not. To investigate the mechanism underlying these differences in complement mediated cytotoxicity, complement-insensitive melanoma cell lines were compared with respect to expression of the decay-accelerating factor (DAF), a membrane regulatory protein that protects blood cells from autologous complement attack. While DAF was undetectable among neuroblastomas, it was present in complement-insensitive melanomas. When the function of DAF was blocked by anti-DAF MAb, C3 uptake and complement-mediated lysis of the insensitive melanoma lines were markedly enhanced. F(ab')2 fragments were as effective in enhancing lysis as intact anti-DAF MAb. The DAF-negative and DAF-positive melanoma cell lines were comparably resistant to passive lysis by cobra venom factor-treated serum. The data suggest that in some tumors, DAF activity accounts for their resistance to complement-mediated killing. The ability to render these cells complement-sensitive by blocking DAF function may have implications for immunotherapy.\r"

  ".W": "The microbiostatic action of macrophages was studied in vitro employing peritoneal cytotoxic macrophages (CM) from mice acting against Cryptococcus neoformans cultured in Dulbecco's medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Fungistasis was measured using electronic particle counting after lysis of macrophages with detergent. Macrophage fungistasis failed in medium lacking only L-arginine. Complete fungistasis was restored by L-arginine; restoration was concentration dependent, maximal at 200 microM. Deletion of all other essential amino acids did not abrogate fungistasis provided that L-arginine was present. Of twenty guanido compounds, including D-arginine, only three (L-arginine, L-homoarginine, and L-arginine methylester) supported fungistasis. Known activators or mediators of macrophage cytotoxicity (endotoxin, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor) did not replace L-arginine for CM-mediated fungistasis. The guanido analogue NG-monomethyl-L-arginine was a potent competitive inhibitor of CM-mediated fungistasis giving 50% inhibition at an inhibitor/L-arginine ratio of 1:27. Although CM completely blocked fungal reproduction via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism, the majority of the dormant fungi remained viable. Thus, this mechanism is viewed as a microbiostatic process similar or identical to the tumoristatic effect of macrophages. This suggests the production of a broad spectrum biostatic metabolite(s) upon consumption of L-arginine by cytotoxic macrophages.\r"

  ".W": "To study the mechanism of the diabetogenic action of ethanol, ethanol (0.75 g/kg over 30 min) and then glucose (0.5 g/kg over 5 min) were infused intravenously into six normal males. During the 4-h study, 21.8 +/- 2.1 g of ethanol was metabolized and oxidized to CO2 and H2O. Ethanol decreased total body fat oxidation by 79% and protein oxidation by 39%, and almost completely abolished the 249% rise in carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation seen in controls after glucose infusion. Ethanol decreased the basal rate of glucose appearance (GRa) by 30% and the basal rate of glucose disappearance (GRd) by 38%, potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin release by 54%, and had no effect on glucose tolerance. In hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies, ethanol caused a 36% decrease in glucose disposal. We conclude that ethanol was a preferred fuel preventing fat, and to lesser degrees, CHO and protein, from being oxidized. It also caused acute insulin resistance which was compensated for by hypersecretion of insulin.\r"

  ".W": "Diacylglycerols (DAG) modulate secretory responses by the activation of protein kinase C. Early changes in DAG formation induced by the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol were compared to those caused by the nutrient secretagogue glucose in pancreatic islets. Turnover rates of DAG were investigated in radiolabeling experiments, whereas changes in total mass and fatty acid composition of DAG were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography. When islet lipids were labeled to steady state in tissue culture with [3H]glycerol, carbachol induced a rapid (10 s) and sustained increase of [3H]DAG generation. In contrast, glucose stimulation failed to increase [3H]glycerol containing DAG, and this was probably due to the isotopic dilution of the label secondary to enhanced glycolysis. This was substantiated by following the transfer of 14C from glucose into DAG. Within 1 min of acute exposure of islets to D-[U-14C]-glucose at stimulatory concentrations, DAG labeling increased fivefold representing up to 2% of total glucose usage. Similar stimulation of 14C incorporation into other neutral lipids and inositol phospholipids was observed, suggesting the enhanced de novo synthesis of phosphatidic acid, the common precursor for DAG, and inositol phospholipids from glycolytic intermediates. Transfer of 14C from glucose was not stimulated by agents such as carbachol and exogenous phospholipase C that act primarily on inositol phospholipid breakdown. The total mass of islet DAG was increased by 60% after both carbachol and glucose stimulation. However, analysis of the fatty acid composition of carbachol-generated DAG revealed at the early time point (10 s) a prevalent stearoyl-arachidonoyl configuration similar to that reported for inositol phospholipids. This pattern shifted to a DAG enriched in palmitic acid at a later time point. Glucose-stimulated islets displayed a predominance of palmitic acid containing DAG, indicating increased de novo synthesis of the putative second messenger rather than its formation by inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Indeed, steady-state labeling of these phospholipids with [3H]inositol confirmed this idea since only carbachol caused detectable inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. Thus, although protein kinase C may be activated by both carbachol and glucose, the two secretagogues generate diacylglycerols through different mechanisms.\r"

  ".W": "MAb directed to the thyroid microsomal antigen have been developed. All bound to 101- and 107-kD bands in Western blot analysis using thyroid microsomal fraction as antigen. The MAb also bound to microsomal proteins immunoprecipitated by serum from patients having a high titer of anti-microsomal antibody but no antibodies to thyroglobulin or thyrotropin-stimulating hormone receptor. The pattern of binding was related to the amount of reducing agent. The 101- and 107-kD bands were increased by addition of dithiothreitol whereas, in its absence, numerous bands of higher molecular weight were present, suggesting a multimeric protein structure. Despite the inability to immunoprecipitate thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzymatic activity, the MAb bound intensively in Western blot to denatured purified hog TPO and to denatured immunopurified human TPO. Trypsin digestion of the 101-107-kD antigen produced a doublet of 84-88 kD that was still immunoreactive with MAb. One of five polyclonal sera tested (with a microsomal antibody titer greater than 1/20,480 measured by the tanned red cell hemagglutination technique) also recognized the 84-88 kD trypsin fragments. Addition of V8 protease led to a disappearance of the 107-kD protein, but not the 101-kD protein, proving that this antigen is formed by two different polypeptides. The MAb bound strongly to thyroid epithelium, whereas binding to papillary carcinoma was absent or low and moderate for follicular and Hurthle cell carcinoma. This study indicates that the thyroid microsomal antigen and TPO are identical and are constituted of two different polypeptides. On SDS-PAGE the antigen appears as two contiguous bands which share common epitopes but are not identical, as proven by their size and difference in susceptibility to proteolytic digestion. The immunoreactivity of the molecule is highly dependent on a trypsin-sensitive site, which appears important in the recognition of the antigen by polyclonal sera and may have biological importance. The expression of microsomal antigenicity is variable among various thyroid carcinomas.\r"

Rat hearts were perfused with 125I-insulin (10(-10) M) alone or in combination with unlabeled insulin (10(-9)-10(-5) M). 125I grains (shown to represent greater than 90% intact insulin) over both capillary endothelium and cardiac muscle decreased in a dose-dependent manner when hearts were co-perfused with labeled insulin and increasing concentrations of unlabeled insulin. Perfusion of 125I-desoctapeptide (DOP) insulin, a low affinity insulin analogue, with unlabeled insulin (10(-9)-10(-5) M) had no effect on the appearance of 125I-DOP insulin over microvessel endothelium and muscle. When capillary receptors were first destroyed by trypsin treatment or blocked by anti-receptor antibodies, the appearance of 125I-insulin in cardiac muscle decreased proportional to the inhibition of insulin binding to the capillary receptors. We conclude that insulin binding to capillary endothelial receptors is a central step in the transport of intravascular insulin to rat cardiac muscle.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in human hepatoma cells (HEP-G2) has, in addition to its effect on cell growth, short-term metabolic effects acting through its own receptor. We have demonstrated that normal human hepatocytes, compared with HEP-G2 cells, have virtually no IGF-I binding sites. Because the rate of growth is the major difference between the hepatoma and the normal liver, we asked if normal liver might express IGF-I binding sites under physiologic growth conditions. Indeed, whereas adult rat hepatocytes have low IGF-I binding sites similar to those in human liver, hepatocytes from regenerating liver after 3 d subtotal hepatectomy have an approximately sixfold increase (P less than 0.005) and those from fetal rat liver a approximately 12-fold increase (P less than 0.005), to levels comparable to those in the HEP-G2 cells. The specificity of 125I IGF-I binding to its receptor was demonstrated by competition studies with monoclonal antibodies directed toward the IGF-I and the insulin receptors, with unlabeled IGF-I and insulin and by affinity labeling experiments. Thus, if IGF-I has any short-term metabolic functions in the adult human liver, it is not through interaction with its own receptor. Autocrine regulation by IGF-I of liver growth appears possible since IGF-I binding sites are expressed under pathological and physiological conditions of growth. The mechanism that couples these two phenomena remains to be elucidated.\r"

Epidermal lymphocytic infiltration was seen only in allogeneic recipients, with clinical GVHD following transplant, but this was not a consistent finding and no other histological features were seen which would distinguish early GVHD from changes caused by cytotoxic agents. Rectal biopsy specimens, however, were normal in patients before transplant and in autologous recipients at 28 days; single cell necrosis of crypt cells was seen only in six of 13 allogeneic recipients studied after transplant with clinical skin GVHD but no gastrointestinal symptoms. Skin changes greater than I and II are required for the histological diagnosis of GVHD. Rectal changes are more specific and may be present despite a lack of intestinal symptoms.\r"

It can be present in different forms, of which acroscleroderma, with limited cutaneous and extracutaneous involvement, and diffuse scleroderma within a more rapid progression are most characteristic. Circulating antibodies against antinucleolar antigens are present in most patients with systemic scleroderma. They are helpful for establishing a classification and for determining the prognosis of the disease; their involvement in the pathogenesis, however, is still unclear. Alterations of the blood vessels and induction of fibroblasts by potent mediators are thought to play an important role in the early phase of scleroderma. Therefore early diagnosis is required, which then can initiate vasoactive therapy. In patients with systemic scleroderma, who also suffer from additional myositis, interstitial lung diseases, or arthritis, anti-inflammatory treatment with prednisolone and azathioprine is suggested. Development and progression of fibrosis cannot yet be influenced sufficiently. Only D-penicillamine affecting cross-linking of collagen has been widely used in scleroderma and has some beneficial effect.\r"

All patients with solar keratoses showed a decrease in the mean area and number of lesions and eight patients demonstrated complete healing clinically. Two patients experienced recurrence at 9 months after completion of treatment. Histometric and cell kinetic measurements on the epidermis of skin samples from these patients were performed. They revealed epidermal thickening and increased deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis both in lesions and in clinically uninvolved skin following treatment. Assessments were also made of enzyme activities in lesions and uninvolved skin with the use of established quantitative cytochemical techniques. Significant reduction in levels of succinic dehydrogenase activity following etretinate treatment was detected in solar keratoses and in basal cell carcinomas. This was also the case for uninvolved skin of patients with solar keratoses. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was significantly reduced following etretinate treatment in solar keratoses and in basal cell carcinomas, but uninvolved skin did not exhibit significant changes. These changes are in contrast to those previously reported in normal subjects, where the activity increased, but are similar to those observed in patients with ichthyotic disorders. The alterations in the cytochemical profile following administration of etretinate in the lesions of patients reported here are consistent with the view that the drug promotes a more normal pattern of epidermal differentiation. We favor the view that etretinate's antineoplastic action is exerted by preferentially allowing differentiation of normal epidermal cells and inhibiting dysplastic cells.\r"

Other reports, such as congenital malformations, serve to emphasize some of the serious reactions that are known to occur.

It frequently is thought to be the cutaneous manifestation of an underlying systemic disease. In this review of pyoderma gangrenosum, the characteristics of the disease are described and a differential diagnosis is formulated. Associations with systemic diseases are made through a review of the literature. The pathophysiology of pyoderma gangrenosum and probable causes are considered, and special consideration is given to the immunologic mechanisms that may be operative in the disease. Finally the currently available therapeutic alternatives are reviewed.\r"

To clarify the evidence behind this routine practice, we reviewed the three randomized controlled trials on this subject. Although in all three similar dosages of corticosteroids (40 mg to 60 mg prednisone daily for 2 to 4 weeks) were used, deficiencies in reported clinical characteristics of study subjects, the potential for bias in the ascertainment of pain duration, and the inability to exclude type II error make it impossible to determine whether or not this practice is effective. More research on this subject is needed, with greater attention to good study methodology.\r"

Relative risks (more appropriately \"odds ratios\") and 95% confidence intervals were quoted or calculated for each risk factor in each study. Those risk factors that were reported to be significant in over half of the studies include: phenotypic factors (blue eyes, blond or red hair, light complexion, freckles, sun sensitivity, and inability to tan); personal history of non-melanoma cutaneous cancer or precancer; higher socioeconomic status; increased numbers of nevocytic nevi; and bursts of sun exposure. Further study is needed on family history and personal history of MM; these were not found to be significant risk factors in over half the reviewed case-control studies. This review leaves out other undoubtedly important risk factors such as dysplastic nervus syndrome and race, which need investigation by the case-control method. Determination of risk factors allows the identification of that subset of the population most at risk for the development of MM. Given the continued increase in the incidence of MM, these data can help to focus preventive measures on the more susceptible subgroups of the population.\r"

The mean time to randomization was 209 min and 52% of patients were randomized within 3 h of symptom onset. Quantitative, tomographic thallium-201 infarct size and radionuclide ejection fraction were measured at 8.2 +/- 7.5 weeks in 207 survivors who lived within a 100 mile radius of a centralized laboratory. Overall, infarct size as a percent of the left ventricle was 19 +/- 13% for control subjects and 15 +/- 13% for treatment patients (p = 0.03). For anterior infarction in patients entered within 3 h of symptom onset, infarct size was 28 +/- 13% in the control group versus 19 +/- 15% for the treatment group (p = 0.09). Left ventricular ejection fraction was 47 +/- 15% in the control versus 51 +/- 15% in the treatment group (p = 0.08). For anterior infarction of less than 3 h duration, the ejection fraction was 38 +/- 16% in the control versus 48 +/- 20% in the treatment group (p = 0.13). By statistical analysis incorporating the nonsurvivors, p values for all of these variables were less than or equal to 0.08. There was no benefit for patients with inferior infarction or for anterior infarction of greater than 3 h duration. It is concluded that intravenous streptokinase, when given within 3 h of symptom onset to patients with anterior infarction, reduces infarct size and improves ventricular function.\r"

All patients had previously documented coronary artery disease and reproducible exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Thirty-five patients (Group I) had a history of angina and reported anginal symptoms during exercise stress testing; 39 patients (Group II) were asymptomatic and had documented silent myocardial ischemia during exercise. Baseline beta-endorphin plasma levels were measured in blood samples taken before exercise stress testing and analyzed by beta-endorphin-I125-RIA Kit-NEN (a radioimmunoassay method). The mean baseline beta-endorphin plasma level was 22.5 +/- 19 pg/ml in patients with anginal symptoms compared with 43.7 +/- 28 pg/ml in asymptomatic patients (p less than 0.001). Baseline blood pressure and heart rate-systolic pressure (rate-pressure) product at baseline and at ischemia threshold (1 mm ST segment depression) were similar in the two groups. Group II patients had a longer exercise duration (p less than 0.01), more pronounced ST segment depression (p less than 0.001) and a higher peak rate-pressure product (p less than 0.01). The extent of coronary artery disease, ejection fraction and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were similar in the two groups. These data suggest that higher baseline beta-endorphin plasma levels may play a role in the decreased sensitivity to pain in patients with silent myocardial ischemia. In addition, different beta-endorphin levels can be associated with a different sensitivity to pain.\r"

In an attempt to determine whether this \"restrictive\" physiology could be demonstrated noninvasively, 14 patients who had a history, physical examination, two-dimensional echocardiogram and catheterization data compatible with a restrictive myocardial process were studied with pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound. Forty normal subjects served as a control group. The Doppler ultrasound evaluation included measurement of peak mitral and tricuspid flow velocities and flow velocity integrals, mitral and tricuspid deceleration times and central venous flow patterns during apnea and inspiration. The flow velocity recordings across the mitral and tricuspid valves in patients manifesting restriction were markedly different from those in normal subjects, showing shortened deceleration times across both valves, which indicated both an abrupt premature cessation of ventricular filling and the presence of a diastolic dip-plateau contour in ventricular pressure recordings. In addition, abnormal central venous flow velocity reversals with inspiration and diastolic mitral and tricuspid regurgitation were frequently observed, also suggesting the reduced myocardial compliance characteristic of a restrictive myocardial process.\r"

  ".W": "Glucose intolerance has been observed often in elderly subjects, but it is not yet clear whether this impaired metabolic state is due to the aging process itself or is secondary to the appearance of other age-related variables. This study attempts to elucidate the effect of age in itself on factors controlling glucose tolerance. Several metabolic parameters were measured in 10 young male controls (23-29 yr) and 17 nonhospitalized, healthy, nonobese, old (60-80 yr) male subjects. Insulin binding to circulating cells was performed along with the intravenous glucose tolerance test, and the data were analyzed by the minimal model method. This approach yields the following measures: tissue insulin sensitivity (SI), fractional glucose disappearance at basal insulin (glucose effectiveness, SG), and first (phi 1) and second (phi 2) phase beta-cell responsiveness to glucose. Insulin-binding capacity to monocytes and erythrocytes was respectively 6.03% +/- 0.57% and 5.96% +/- 0.53% (elderly), 5.97% +/- 0.39% and 5.36% +/- 0.57% (young); SI was 6.20 +/- 0.59 X 10(4) min-1/(microU/mL) (elderly) and 6.35 +/- 0.30 (young); SG was 0.016 +/- 0.002 min-1 (elderly) and 0.019 +/- 0.003 (young); phi 1 was 1.84 +/- 0.29 min-1 (microU/mL)/(mg/dL) (elderly) and 3.37 +/- 0.84 (young); phi 2 was 13.80 +/- 1.78 X 10(4) min-2 (microU/mL)/(mg/dL) (elderly) and 9.59 +/- 2.65 (young). These results show no change with aging of tissue insulin sensitivity and an intact beta-cell activity, suggesting that age per se does not contribute to the deterioration of glucose tolerance when the effect of other age-related variables, eg, obesity and physical inactivity, is precluded.\r"

Organisms recovered from these cultures were Candida (not albicans), Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and in four cases, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In the four cases of missed Pseudomonas the patients were receiving aminoglycoside therapy for 2 to 6 days and/or drugs that dye the urine. Despite the fact that many patients were on medications known to interfere with the test strips, the negative predictive value was still 96.0% showing that the strips may be suitable for use with this population given the understanding that certain antibiotics and/or substances that dye the urine may give false negative results.\r"

Further immunofluorescence analyses performed on uncultured cells indicated that such a putative CD2-CD3+ phenotype was restricted to a fraction of those T lymphocytes which carry a surface receptor of the \"second family\" (gamma/delta). The actual lack of CD2 expression was confirmed by a subsequent series of cloning experiments which showed that none of the three well characterized CD2 epitopic clusters, namely T11/1, T11/2, and T11/3, were detectable on the surface of the relevant cells. The cultured CD2-, CD3+/TCR gamma + lymphocytes were found to display, as well as their CD2+ counterparts, both non-MHC-restricted cytotoxic function and proliferative responses induced via the gamma receptor complex. In contrast, the proliferative capacity of the CD2-, CD3+/TCR-gamma + cells observed in a culture system designed for in vitro expansion of lymphocytes with undefined specificity was extremely limited. This may relate to an impaired interaction of the CD2- cloned lymphocytes with lymphocyte function-associated (LFA)3+ irradiated cells present in the feeder layer. Further characterization of such minor CD2- T lymphocytes subsets may help to better understand the biologic relevance of the CD2/LFA3 pathway of cell-cell interaction.\r"

The function of hemopoietic progenitor cells and microenvironmental elements that regulate their growth and differentiation were studied in mev mice with two types of long term bone marrow cultures. Cells from bone marrow of homozygous defective mev/mev mice were non-productive under conditions that normally support replication of stem cells and production of neutrophil granulocytes. Similarly, in a different culture system, lymphocytes were produced from normal littermate, but not mev/mev bone marrow. Initial overgrowth of cells having macrophage-like characteristics occurred in both culture systems with marrow from defective mice. Co-cultures of normal and defective bone marrow cells were always non-productive. In contrast, supernatants of mev/mev bone marrow cultures did not have a detrimental effect on cultures of normal cells, implying that the suppression was cell-associated. Furthermore, there was no evidence for abnormal release of granulocyte or macrophage growth factors in mev bone marrow cultures. A small population of cells in mev/mev bone marrow cultures were morphologically similar to \"stromal\" cells that support lymphohemopoiesis. Certain culture strategies could be used to enrich for these. mev/mev stromal cells had affinity for normal lymphocytes; however, they did not support lymphocyte growth. The long term bone marrow cultures thus reveal an apparent imbalance in the regulatory mechanisms affected by these single gene mutations. This is manifested by preferential or aberrant growth of one type of adherent cell and a possible functional abnormality of stromal cells. mev mice could provide an ideal model for investigating cell-associated molecules that normally limit progenitor cell replication.\r"

The antibody UCHL1 reacts with a 180-kDa determinant of the leukocyte common Ag and exhibits a reciprocal T subset distribution pattern to the CD45R group. Peripheral blood T cells were 40% positive for UCHL1 and 58 to 65% positive for the CD45R antibodies; less than 1% of cells stained for both. On activation of CD45R+,UCHL1- T cells by PHA, up to 40% of cells became positive for both CD45R and UCHL1 by day 3. By day 7, CD45R+,UCHL1- cells fell from 90 to less than 21% whereas UCHL1+,CD45R- cells rose from 2 to 93%. Conversely, PHA-stimulated UCHL1+,CD45R- cells remained UCHL1+,CD45R- during the 7 days in culture showing that phenotypic change was unidirectional from CD45R+ to UCHL1+. In primary allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reactions, activated CD45R+ T cells also showed a change to UCHL1+. When these cells were rechallenged by the original alloantigen, the UCHL1+ cells showed 7- to 20-fold greater proliferation than the CD45R+ cells on day 3 after rechallenge. The recovery of virtually all alloantigen induced secondary proliferative response in the UCHL1+,CD45R- T cell population suggests that UCHL1 identifies a primed population of T cells which may include memory cells.\r"

  ".W": "In allergic and nonallergic lung diseases, if intraluminal mast cells adhere to airway epithelium, inflammatory mediators released from activated mast cells may reach high local concentrations and thus greatly affect airway function. To determine whether mast cells adhere to airway epithelial cells, radiolabeled or unlabeled dog mastocytoma cells were incubated with cultured dog tracheal epithelial cells, with extracellular matrix substrates, and with cryostat-cut sections of dog trachea. Mast cells adhered well to cultured epithelial cells (35 +/- 13% adhesion, mean +/- 1 SD, n = 23) but adhered poorly to types I and IV collagen or to fibronectin (less than 7.5% mean adhesion in all cases). Similarly, in tracheal tissue sections, mast cells adhered preferentially to epithelial cells in surface epithelium or in submucosal glands but not to basal membrane or connective tissue. Adhesion to cultured epithelial cells was a characteristics of a subpopulation of mast cells, could persist for more than 48 h, did not require energy or the presence of divalent cations, and was not mediated by a known family of leukocyte-associated adhesion glycoproteins. Adhesion was completely abolished by pretreatment of mast cells with pronase E or proteinase K but not with trypsin (up to 10 micrograms/ml at 37 degrees C for 20 min each). In contrast, pretreatment of cultured epithelial cells with any of these proteinases had no effect on adhesion. It is concluded that dog mastocytoma mast cells adhere to dog tracheal epithelial cells and do so selectively. It is suggested that mast cell adhesion to airway epithelium may play a role in the effectiveness of mast cell-epithelial cell interactions, and thus, in certain lung diseases, airway function may be affected by intraluminal mast cells more than is currently appreciated.\r"

  ".U": "88170796\r", 
  ".W": "A mAb EBM11, raised against human macrophages [M phi] was found to detect a bovine M phi diameter-subpopulation. The Ag was strictly intracellular and was expressed in M phi only at a certain state of maturation. Its expression was regulated independently of the activation state of the cells, as revealed by treating M phi in vitro with bovine rIFN-alpha I1, IFN-gamma, or TNF-alpha, all potent M luminal diameter activators. Such treatment had no apparent effect on Ag expression. The Ag was present in 1 to 5% of peripheral blood leukocytes, i.e., up to 20% of circulating blood monocytes, in both normal noninfected cattle and in cattle persistently infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus. Blood monocytes of the latter group were activated in vivo, but apparently did not reach a more mature state than found in noninfected animals. After an acute infection with bovine herpes virus type 1, the frequency and total number of EBM11+ cells decreased dramatically in inverse relationship to an equally significant increase in frequency and total number of circulating monocytes. In cryostat sections of normal tissues, the EBM11 mAb reacted with sinus M phi and M phi in germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, with alveolar M phi and liver Kupffer cells. In skin it reacted with few scattered M phi in the dermis, but not with epidermal Langerhans cells. This latter feature distinguishes the bovine system from the human. In virus-induced inflammatory processes in skin and keratinized epithelia EBM11+ cells constituted a subpopulation of the infiltrating M phi. The data obtained suggest that EBM11 mAb could be useful both for the elucidation of differentiation/maturation pathways of cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage as well as for studies of M phi-virus interactions in virus infections. In either aspect cattle could provide a useful comparative model.\r"

Only rare cells were stained with anti-2H4 in MS plaques, plaque edges, and adjacent white matter, whereas 2H4+ cells were more numerous in viral encephalitis (p less than 0.001). By contrast, no quantitative differences were found between MS plaque edges and viral encephalitis with anti-4B4 (helper-inducer function associated), anti-CD4, anti-CD3, and anti-IL-2R mAb, although there were fewer CD8+ cells in MS (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that the 2H4 Ag is selectively decreased and, because it is associated with suppressor-inducer function of CD4+ cells, that there may be a defect in the down-regulation of the in situ immune response in MS.\r"

The results demonstrate that TGF-beta 1, in a dose-related manner, significantly inhibits rIL-2-induced LAK cell activity against Daudi and COLO target cells and, to a lesser degree, against K-562 cells. Maximal inhibition was obtained by the addition of TGF-beta 1 at the time of culture initiation and, to a lesser degree, on day 1. Only minimal inhibition was obtained when TGF-beta 1 addition was delayed until day 2 of culture or when added directly into the LAK cell assay. Additional studies demonstrated that porcine platelet-derived TGF-beta 2 and human rTGF-beta 1 inhibited LAK cell generation similar to that obtained with TGF-beta 1. The inhibition of LAK cell activity by TGF-beta 1 was reversed by the addition of human rTNF-alpha at the initiation of culture. In addition, rTNF-alpha synergized with suboptimal levels of rIL-2 in the generation of LAK activity. After stimulation with rIL-2, LAK cells produced significant levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta. TGF-beta 1 inhibited the production of these cytokines in a dose-related manner. The results extend the previous known activities for human rTNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1 and further demonstrate the reciprocal relationship between these two molecules in the regulation of certain immune functions.\r"

  ".U": "88170818\r", 
  ".W": "Mast cells clearly are critical for the expression of some IgE-dependent responses, but their roles in other forms of inflammation are uncertain. We previously described a new model system for defining the unique contribution of mast cells to biologic responses in vivo, genetically mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice that have undergone selective local repair of their mast cell deficiency by the injection of IL-3-dependent cultured mast cells derived from the congenic normal (WBB6F1-+/+) mice. Using this approach, we analyzed the contribution of mast cells to the acute inflammation induced by the epicutaneous application of PMA. Even though PMA can activate a wide variety of cell types that may contribute to acute inflammation, we found that mast cells were required for the full expression of the tissue swelling and leukocyte infiltration associated with the response to the agent in vivo. Thus, in WBB6F1-W/Wv mice selectively reconstituted with dermal mast cells by intradermal injection of cultured WBB6F1-+/+ mast cells into the left ear only, PMA induced approximately twice the tissue swelling and neutrophil infiltration in the mast cell-reconstituted left ears as in the contralateral control ears. This represents the first use of W/Wv mice locally reconstituted with mast cells to confirm the hypothesis that mast cells can represent an important amplification mechanism in acute inflammatory responses of nonimmunologic origin. It also defines a model system that may be generally useful for investigating mast cell-dependent and -independent aspects of acute inflammatory responses.\r"

  ".W": "Rabbits immunized with the protease resistant recombinant Treponema pallidum surface-associated Ag 4D showed an altered course of experimental syphilis after intradermal challenge with virulent T. pallidum. Vaccination trials using three different protocols were examined. In one experiment, a combined i.m.-i.v. immunization protocol was compared with an i.m. injection schedule. Four of five rabbits immunized by the i.m.-i.v. protocol developed morphologically atypical lesions at each of 16 sites, whereas the i.m. injected animals showed no evidence of attenuated disease. Moreover, immunization by both protocols elicited equally high ELISA titers of 4D-specific IgG antibody suggesting that cellular immune mechanisms may have been involved. In an effort to augment cell-mediated responses to 4D, seven rabbits received i.v. immunizations with an emulsion of 4D, purified BCG cell wall skeletons, and trehalose dimycolate in an oil-microdroplet form (4D-cell wall skeleton-trehalose dimycolate). Splenic lymphocytes from three representative immunized animals had a strong in vitro proliferative response to 4D as compared to controls. Further, all animals developed high anti-4D titers in response to immunization. After challenge with virulent T. pallidum, six of the seven rabbits developed an early cutaneous response (3-8 days) at the sites of inoculation consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction followed by morphologically atypical lesions. Aspirates from each of three representative atypical lesions were devoid of treponemes by darkfield examination at day 14, whereas motile T. pallidum were observed in aspirates from four of five control sites. Between days 20 and 24, lesions in the 4D-cell wall skeleton-trehalose dimycolate immunized rabbits began to enlarge and become more typical in appearance; aspirates from six of seven representative lesions were darkfield positive. We conclude that 1) immunization with the r4D Ag alters the course of experimental syphilis in a manner consistent with previously defined parameters of partial protection and 2) immunizations protocols containing an i.v. component are more effective than protocols using the i.m. route alone.\r"

The oligonucleotide penetrates the cells without any treatment, with a plateau of cell association reached in 2 h. The oligonucleotide specifically blocked the de novo synthesis of c-myc protein, induced by PHA in human resting peripheral T cells, without impairing the overall synthesis of other proteins, as shown by two-dimensional analysis of [35S]methionine pulse-labeled proteins. The specific inhibition of c-myc protein synthesis prevented the entry into S phase of resting T cells, induced to proliferate by PHA, or IL-2-dependent T cells induced by IL-2, as shown by [3H]thymidine incorporation. The inhibition of proliferation was specific since it was not observed with the corresponding sense-oligonucleotide and was reversed by preincubation of the cells with an excess of sense oligonucleotide. These results clearly support a role for c-myc protein in the proliferation process and show that inducible protein expression can be blocked by means of synthetic oligonucleotides complementary to a coding exon.\r"

Aging led to a consistent decline (an average of approximately 60%) in the level of c-myc mRNA in stimulated cells. The time course for c-myc RNA accumulation was similar for old and young mice. Nuclear runoff experiments showed that mitogen stimulation leads to an equivalent increase in transcription of the c-myc gene in T cells from old and young mice. Furthermore, in the presence of 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole riboside, a selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, c-myc mRNA decayed with equal kinetics in cells from mice of different ages. These results show that lymphocytes from aged mice exhibit defects in gene expression very early in the activation process and suggest that these deficits may involve, at least for some genes, alterations in post-transcriptional processing.\r"

Four patterns of DNA distribution were identified, but only histograms that demonstrated cells containing nuclei with more than 4C DNA content (hypertetraploidy) reliably distinguished LN involved with CTCL from LN with reactive changes; for example, dermatopathic lymphadenitis. An abnormal DNA histogram with evidence of hypertetraploidy was demonstrated in 9 of 12 LN showing histopathologic evidence of involvement compared with no abnormal histograms in 14 LN without histopathologic involvement. One LN that was diffusely involved with CTCL had a DNA distribution characteristic of a relatively high level of cell proliferation, but without definite hypertetraploidy. Cytogenetic studies on the blood of this patient, who had Sezary syndrome, demonstrated a clone of lymphocytes with a pseudodiploid karyotype without a related polyploid subline. The remaining two histopathologically involved LN had normal DNA histograms; these LN were only focally involved with CTCL. These observations indicate that DNA-cytophotometry correlates well with the histopathologic findings in LN diffusely involved with CTCL, but may be normal in LN with focal involvement or in those that contain cytogenetically abnormal cells with a near-diploid DNA content.\r"

Because, depending on their state of activation and/or differentiation, Langerhans cells exhibit a varying immunophenotype, we investigated whether histiocytosis X cells display a similar phenotypic heterogeneity and, if so, whether the heterogenous biological behavior of histiocytosis X is reflected by differences in the immunophenotype of the proliferating cells. In 21 patients suffering from different clinical manifestations of histiocytosis X, proliferating cells uniformly expressed class I and II alloantigens, T200, CD1, CD4, and S100 protein. In 12 of 21 cases, histiocytosis X cells additionally exhibited immunocytochemically detectable amounts of C3b and C3bi receptors and certain monocyte/macrophage antigens (CDw14, Ki-M1, Ki-M6). This immunophenotypic heterogeneity of histiocytosis X cells could not be correlated with clinical course, prognosis, and final outcome of the disease in a given patient. The capacity of histiocytosis X cells to immunophenotypically mimic various states of Langerhans cell activation and/or differentiation, however, underscores the concept of histiocytosis X as a proliferative disorder of Langerhans cell origin.\r"

Ninety-seven nevomelanocytic lesions, neurofibromas, epithelial lesions, and a plasmacellular infiltrate were evaluated. AFH1 was immunoreactive on 54 of 55 nevocytic lesions (98.2%), 15 of 16 primary melanomas (93.7%), a lentigo maligna, and nests in 21 of 21 dysplastic nevi (100%). Of 100 consecutive basal melanocytes of intraepidermal melanoma cells counted in each lesion, mean AFH1 immunoreactivity for nonnested basal melanocytes in nevocellular nevi was 3.8%; for dysplastic nevi, 13.8%; and for intraepidermal melanoma cells, 78.0%. When nonnested basal melanocytes were subdivided into cytologically normal and abnormal cell groups, AFH1 immunoreactivity was 9.4% and 72.6%, respectively. AFH1 recognition of the lentiginous portion of dysplastic nevi corresponds statistically to the appearance of abnormal melanocyte cytology, nest formation, or both. Using 50% immunoreactive nonnested melanocytes as the criterion, AFH1 seems to distinguish primary melanoma from dysplastic nevi with a sensitivity of 93.8% and a specificity of 95.8%.\r"

Among cultured cells the three mAbs reacted exclusively with normal melanocytes and pigmented melanomas, but not with nonpigmented melanomas or cells of other lineage. Immunohistochemical assays using mAbTA99 and mAbCF21 on fresh-frozen sections from a large panel of normal tissues revealed a characteristic pattern of reactivity restricted to pigmented cells. mAbC350 did not react with any normal tissues. All nevi and primary melanoma specimens and 93% of metastatic melanomas were reactive with at least one of these three monoclonal antibodies. No reactivity was found with 62 nonmelanoma tumors. An inverse correlation was observed between TA99 expression and stage of tumor progression. These markers are useful for studies of melanocyte differentiation and malignant transformation, subsetting of melanocytic lesions, and identification of tumors of melanocytic origin.\r"

We have studied the epidermal distribution of this enzyme (\"epidermal transglutaminase\") and its activity by fluorescence microscopy in histological sections of normal human skin and human skin grafted onto nude mice. Three different techniques were employed: (i) incubation of skin sections with a monoclonal antibody raised against a purified preparation of the enzyme; (ii) incubation of skin sections with dansylcadaverine, a fluorescent substrate of the enzyme, in the presence of Ca++ ions; and (iii) subcutaneous injection of dansylcadaverine into mice, at least 2 months after grafting. The first technique is supposed to detect all enzyme molecules carrying the epitope that is recognized by the antibody, even when the enzyme is catalytically not active; the second should decorate all sites in which membrane-bound transglutaminase activity is located, and the third detects only sites in which transglutaminase is active in vivo. With the first two techniques a broad band of plasma membrane associated fluorescence, reaching from the middle of the spinous layer to the stratum corneum, was detected in both normal and grafted skin. In vivo enzyme activity, however, was found to be restricted to one, or at most two, cell layers at the interface of the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum and to coincide with the layer in which the antigenicity of involucrin, a natural substrate of epidermal transglutaminase, disappeared.\r"

Twenty guinea pigs were injected intradermally with 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 ml of either bullous pemphigoid serum or IgG fraction containing high-titer complement-binding anti-BMZ antibodies or an equivalent volume of normal human serum or IgG fraction as control. Sites were biopsied at intervals after injection and were examined by routine histology and direct immunofluorescence. The results showed (a) no difference in the incidence of dermal epidermal separation or type of inflammation in experimental and control sites; (b) no evidence of an eosinophil-rich inflammatory reaction typical of bullous pemphigoid; (c) an absence of linear BMZ deposits of IgG and complement in the majority of sites injected with bullous pemphigoid antibodies; and (d) no correlation between dermal-epidermal separation and deposition of immune reactants at the BMZ. These results suggest the histologic changes seen in guinea pigs that are administered intradermal injections of bullous pemphigoid antibodies are nonspecific and that the model is not suitable for testing the pathogenicity of anti-BMZ antibodies in sera or IgG fractions.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of calcium ions on human epidermis was studied using an organ culture system. Acantholysis-like suprabasal cleft formation was constantly observed within 12 hours, when normal human skin explants were cultured in medium with less than 0.1 mM of calcium ions. This change resembled that induced by pemphigus serum observed with light or electron microscopy. This effect was greatly enhanced by the presence of fetal calf serum and was reversed when normal calcium concentrations were added back. Pemphigus antigen was not reduced in the explants. This change was inhibited by alpha 2-macroglobulin, a proteinase inhibitor with a wide spectrum. Biochemical study did not show apparent change of glycoproteins in epidermal cells. Therefore, it is most likely that this phenomenon is induced by some proteinase(s) which is(are) released from epidermal cells in the presence of fetal calf serum and activated at very low calcium ion concentration. Furthermore, this system is considered to be more useful than the cell culture system to study the effect of calcium ions in organized epidermis.\r"

In direct immunofluorescence (IF) studies without pretreatment, skin-limited and systemic amyloid and colloid bodies in all cases showed positive staining for Ig or C. When these sections were pretreated with 0.1 M glycine buffer (pH 7.2) or 0.05% Tween-20 solution, Ig and C in skin-limited amyloid deposits were negative or weakly positive. In contrast, positive fluorescence of colloid bodies and systemic amyloid masses was not influenced by pretreatment. Existence of amyloid masses before and after pretreatment were confirmed by Thioflavin-T and Dylon stains. In addition, pretreatment did not alter disulfide bonds by DACM staining or the reactivities of amyloid with monoclonal antikeratin antibody EKH4. These results suggest that skin-limited amyloid can be differentiated from systemic amyloid or colloid bodies by these methods. We can infer from the present studies that most of the Ig and C in skin-limited amyloid masses are a result of nonspecific absorption due to penetration of serum, which is different from Ig in systemic amyloid and colloid bodies in as much as in these conditions immunobinding is specific.\r"

It is suggested that both accuracy and reliability are maximized when the histomorphometrics of as many anatomical sampling sites as possible are sampled and the resultant ages are averaged.\r"

Possible risk factors for recurrent NMS are administration of high-potency neuroleptics and reintroduction of neuroleptics before the initial episode of NMS has completely resolved. Bipolar disorder and concomitant use of lithium may predispose to NMS and therefore could also heighten the risk of recurrence.\r"

These results can be compared with those of Renaud et al (Nature, 1986;319:678) that show apamin binding to be a good marker of myotonic dystrophy muscle membranes. We suggest that in myotonic dystrophy a number of nerve regulated membrane markers are precociously expressed by innervated myofibres and that these are likely to be secondary manifestations resulting from an unidentified primary defect.\r"

Eighty-seven of the residents were institutionalized because of nonpsychiatric disorders (60 for chronic neurologic diseases, and 27 for other medical conditions). Forty-two were institutionalized because of a chronic psychosis (39 for schizophrenia, three for affective disorders). We determined for each resident an extensive clinical data base of 54 items including measures of hematologic, nutritional, metabolic and endocrine status, as well as continuing medications. In the nonpsychiatric group, 16 of the 87 men had a seizure disorder. In the psychiatric group, this proportion was only three of 42. The prevalence of epilepsy in the nonpsychiatric group was 20-40 times greater than in the aged-matched general population of men. In the nonpsychiatric group, the onset of seizures followed the onset of organic brain disease. Forty-five percent of seizure disorders occurred in men who had experienced a cerebrovascular accident, and 23% in men with other types of chronic brain disease. The seizures of the nonpsychiatric men had been observed to be generalized clonic-tonic in 45%, and partial complex in 22%. Ninety-four percent of the nonpsychiatric men with epilepsy received anticonvulsants, and none had experienced more than one seizure during the preceding year. Univariate statistical analysis of the 54 item data base showed that the occurrence of seizure disorder correlated inversely with age, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and serum bilirubin, and directly with plasma testosterone, hemoglobin, use of anticonvulsants, and use of psychotherapeutic agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Patients were randomized to receive either FA, 200 mg/m2/d for five consecutive days, or nothing. All patients received 5-FU, 370 mg/m2/d for five days on the first course, with subsequent dose modifications to maintain equal toxicity in the two arms. One hundred thirty patients were entered on trial and only five were excluded from the analysis because they did not meet the eligibility criteria or they refused therapy after randomization. The two treatment arms were balanced for 11 clinical characteristics. Patients were evaluated for response at the end of every two treatment courses and toxicity after every course of therapy. Median follow-up was 1.45 years. Dose-limiting toxicity was mucositis and diarrhea on this treatment schedule, although neutropenia was apparent. The response rate was 33% (21 of 63 patients) in the 5-FU and FA arm and was 7% (four of 61 patients) in the 5-FU arm (P less than .0005). Time to disease progression was significantly different in the combination arm as compared with the single-agent arm (P = .023). Overall survival was significantly longer for patients treated with 5-FU and FA as compared with those receiving 5-FU alone (P = .05). The median survival was 12.6 months for patients receiving the combination, and 9.6 months for those receiving 5-FU alone. Our results indicate that the combination of 5-FU and FA is effective treatment for patients with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the rectum and colon who have not received prior chemotherapy.\r"

Five (26%) had a partial response (complete resolution of all evidence of CIS on multiple bladder biopsies but persistently positive cytologic preparations). Sixteen patients with recurrent papillary tumors and extensive prior therapy were also treated. Four (25%) had a complete response. Twenty-three of the 35 patients had prior intravesical therapy. Seven of the 23 (30%) patients with prior intravesical chemotherapy or immunotherapy had a complete or partial response to interferon, while eight of the 12 patients (67%) without prior intravesical treatment responded. These responses were achieved with minimal local and systemic toxicity. Of the ten complete responders, five remain in continuous unmaintained remission for 18+ to 37+ months. Intracavitary alpha-2-interferon is an effective new treatment for some patients with bladder cancer.\r"

An intensified regimen with one further cycle of chemotherapy (VADRIAC), total body irradiation (TBI), and autologous bone marrow transplantation was given to patients with primary tumors of the pelvis, humerus, femur, and chest wall without metastases and to all patients with metastases at diagnosis. Patients with primary tumors of the distal extremity and other sites without metastases at diagnosis were treated on a less intensive chemotherapy regimen of VADRIAC without the intensification. Therapy was completed within 6 to 7 months in all patients. Thirteen patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis; only two of these had the lung as the sole site of metastatic disease. Eighteen patients had no evidence of metastatic disease at diagnosis: ten of these patients had tumors that arose in central axis and proximal extremity sites, and eight had tumors that arose in distal extremity and other sites. Thirty of the 31 patients achieved a complete remission, although two patients underwent amputation: one before chemotherapy and radiation and one after chemotherapy and radiation because of persistent local disease. Seventeen remain in their first complete remission at a median time on study of 30 months and a median time after completion of therapy of 24 months. Fourteen patients have relapsed (13) or progressed (1): ten in metastatic sites and four in the primary site. One patient had persistent local disease after radiation requiring amputation. Nine of the 13 patients with metastatic disease at diagnosis have relapsed compared with five of the 18 patients without metastatic disease. For the entire group, the actuarial survival is 78% (65% to 87%) at 30 months, and the actuarial disease-free survival is 58% (46% to 69%) at 30 months.\r"

The case for a dose-cure relationship in a clinically practical dose range must be considered unproven. On the other hand, the evidence for dose-response effects suggests that higher dosages could result in improved quality of life. There is a need to further refine reproducible criteria, both anatomic (such as mediastinal involvement) and non-anatomic (such as performance status), to permit more appropriate selection of patients for high-dose treatment. Studies involving less rather than more treatment with appropriate endpoints might be both ethical and appropriate.\r"

  ".W": "A multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial of nimodipine in poor-grade aneurysm patients was carried out in 17 Canadian hospitals. Of 188 patients enrolled in the trial, 32 were excluded for protocol violations and two were excluded due to statistical considerations, leaving 154 patients for valid outcome analysis. Nimodipine treatment was associated with a significantly better outcome (p less than 0.001): 21 (29.2%) of 72 nimodipine-treated patients had a good outcome at 3 months after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) compared to eight (9.8%) of 82 placebo-treated patients. Delayed ischemic deficits from vasospasm alone were significantly less frequent in the nimodipine group (p less than 0.05) with permanent deficits occurring in five nimodipine-treated patients (6.9%) and in 22 placebo-treated patients (26.8%). Improvement in the good outcome rate and reduction in delayed ischemic deficits from vasospasm alone occurred in both Grade 3 and 4 patients, with no difference between nimodipine- and placebo-treated patients being found in Grade 5 patients. Repeat angiography after Day 4 was carried out in 124 patients. There was no significant difference in the incidence of moderate or severe diffuse spasm, which was seen in 64.3% of nimodipine-treated patients and 66.2% of placebo-treated patients. The authors conclude that nimodipine treatment in poor-grade patients with SAH results in an increase in the number of good outcomes and a reduction in the incidence of delayed neurological deterioration due to vasospasm. This effect occurs by a mechanism other than prevention of large-vessel spasm as visualized on angiography.\r"

  ".U": "88171666\r", 
  ".W": "The clinical, radiological, and histopathological features of 21 cases of angiographically occult intracranial vascular malformations (AOIVM's) are analyzed, and a review of 241 additional appropriately documented, histologically verified cases collected from the literature is presented. In all, there were 115 (43.8%) arteriovenous malformations, 82 (31.2%) cavernous angiomas, 26 (9.9%) venous angiomas, 10 (3.8%) cases of capillary telangiectasis, and 29 (11%) mixed or unclassified angiomas. The result of the analysis shows that there are no essential differences in the patterns of clinical presentation, the computerized tomography (CT) appearance, or the surgical prognosis among these pathological types of vascular malformations. Certain histological features common to all AOIVM's (such as the small caliber, the more or less complete thrombosis of the malformed vessels, and the changes induced in the surrounding brain tissue by repeated microhemorrhages) seem to determine the biological behavior of the anomaly rather than the predominant type of vessel involved. Thus, subdivision of AOIVM's into the four classical pathological types has little practical value. Most AOIVM's are visualized by the CT scan and show a rather typical appearance. Surgical removal, which prevents rebleeding and ameliorates or suppresses seizure activity, is usually easy to perform and represents the treatment of choice for patients with clinically symptomatic AOIVM's.\r"

Three cases were diagnosed 6 to 18 years after spinal surgery and two 14 to 17 years after spinal cord trauma. In each case, delayed progression of symptoms led to the identification of the lesions. The diagnosis was assisted by the use of myelography and delayed computerized tomography scanning in two cases and by magnetic resonance imaging in all five. In each case, the arachnoid cyst appeared to compress the spinal cord or nerve roots; in three cases, the syrinx cavities appeared to exert a significant mass effect. In the two trauma-related cases, the intramedullary cysts were small and may have represented areas of cystic myelomalacia. In four cases, intraoperative real-time ultrasonography helped to localize the arachnoid and intramedullary cavities. All five patients were treated by fenestration of the arachnoid cyst; additional peritoneal shunting of the cyst was performed in one case and of the intramedullary cavity in three. In one patient, the two lesions appeared to have a balancing effect; after drainage of the arachnoid cyst, the syrinx cavity expanded and had to be treated separately. The neurological deficits were reduced in four patients and stabilized in one. Intradural arachnoid cysts and intramedullary cysts may occur together as a late complication of spinal surgery or spinal cord trauma, and either or both lesions may cause delayed neurological deterioration.\r"

Specific attention was focused upon regions in which deep brain stimulation has been most effective in the relief of selected chronic pain syndromes. This study revealed a remarkable, nearly point-to-point correlation between clinically effective stimulation sites and the distribution of pro-opiomelanocortin fibers in the human brain. Of particular interest was the dense innervation of the periventricular stratum along the third ventricle, the parafascicular centromedian region of the thalamus, and the periaqueductal gray matter of the midbrain. This study provides anatomical support for the hypothesis that beta-endorphin-containing neuronal systems may contribute to stimulation analgesia in the human.\r"

The combination of captopril and furosemide induces an even greater difference in renal uptakes than with captopril alone in this rat model. In paired experiments, DTPA complexes were used as a standard to compare the differences in renal uptake between the two kidneys after captopril-furosemide with other existing and potential renal radiodiagnostic agents. No statistically significant difference was found between DTPA, glucoheptonate, dimercaptosuccinic acid, aminated dextran, or lysozyme. However, the differences in renal uptake were significantly less with hippuran than with DTPA. Furosemide and captopril caused delayed renal retention of hippuran after one minute. This response appeared to be due to non-specific volume depletion because it occurred in both clipped and unclipped kidneys.\r"

Midway into the second year, 6 of 30 tactics have been completed. the overall number of completed tactics was dependent upon factors such as complexity of the tactic, degree of management turnover, and operational priorities. The overall numbers of completed tactics are not as significant as the process itself, which provides mechanisms to quantify and identify quality nursing care. As a result, the nursing environment is perceived, both internally and externally, to demonstrate a nursing environment of excellence. Currently, a third annual strategic planning conference is being developed. We are confident that a planning process is in place that provides for a strong future as we continue to strive for achievement of our vision.\r"

Because rhythms in different variables are changed in different ways, the circadian organization that is characteristic of freely feeding animals is disrupted. In the case of daily food restriction (meal feeding), the extent of disruption depends on the timing of the meal in relation to the daily light-dark schedule. Recent studies indicate that the extension of life span by a given level of food restriction is similar regardless of mealtime, whether fixed or shifted at weekly intervals throughout life. Such results suggest that the effects of food restriction on circadian organization are not involved in the effect on survival. On the other hand, changes in any given rhythm (such as an increased amplitude and a decreased overall average of body temperature) could point to the mechanism by which longevity is increased.\r"

The present study investigates secretagogue-induced release of digestive enzymes from dispersed pancreatic acini as well as the concentrations of these enzymes in serum and pancreas after adaptation to a high protein diet. Adult rats were fed an 8.5% casein diet ad libitum. After 14 d the rats were divided into three groups and fed isoenergetic diets constituting 8.5, 24 or 40% protein for an additional 6 d. No significant differences in final body weight or pancreatic weight were observed among the groups of rats. Rats adapted to the 40% protein diet showed significantly higher trypsin and chymotrypsin activity in pancreatic homogenates than rats fed the 8.5% protein diet. These changes in pancreatic enzyme content were not reflected in serum. Pancreatic acini isolated from the 8.5% protein group showed a markedly reduced responsiveness to cholecystokinin (CCK-8), secretin- and carbachol-induced enzyme release in comparison to the other two dietary groups, although basal enzyme release was the same in all groups. These results indicate that the secretion of pancreatic enzymes following a physiological stimulus is affected by a low protein, high carbohydrate diet.\r"

Within genotype, body weights and cumulative food intakes of DHEA and weight-matched groups were not different. Fat pad weights of DHEA rats were significantly lower than those of non-treated groups. Pancreatic insulin content, whether expressed per pancreas or per gram pancreas, was not lowered by DHEA treatment. Fasting serum insulin levels were not altered in lean rats but were significantly lower in DHEA obese rats than in either nontreated obese group. Glucose metabolism (conversion to CO2, fatty acids or glyceride-glycerol) in isolated adipocytes was similar in all groups except that obese rats had greater glyceride-glycerol production than lean rats. Glucose conversion to CO2 in soleus muscle was lower in obese rats than in lean rats. Basal and insulin-stimulated glycogen production was lower in DHEA and weight-matched obese rats than in any other group. Ad libitum-fed lean rats had higher insulin-stimulated glycogen production than DHEA lean and all groups of obese rats. Short-term DHEA treatment of obese Zucker rats lowers serum insulin levels without improvement of insulin resistance in peripheral tissues and without lowering pancreatic insulin content.\r"

Prophylactic administration of furosemide produced no beneficial effect on any measure of pulmonary function compared with use of this drug as needed (prn). However, patients receiving the prophylactic furosemide regimen were found to have more rapid postnatal weight loss, higher pulse rate, and greater sympathomimetic drug requirement during the period of diuretic administration. Patients in the prophylactic group did not demonstrate the moderate expansion in plasma volume between 48 and 96 hours of age seen in the control group. These data suggest that the prophylactic regimen produced an undesirable degree of volume depletion. Further studies should be conducted to develop objective criteria for the selection of the subgroup of patients with respiratory distress syndrome who may benefit from furosemide.\r"

Pavp was similar in the P and NP groups, and Posm and Pavp were correlated significantly in both groups, but the osmotic threshold was lowered by 11 mosm/kg in primigravidas. In the prospective study, Pavp and Posm were correlated significantly at both stages. Pavp rose between trimesters, as did plasma volume and plasma renin activity, but urine volume and osmolality and Posm did not change significantly. These data confirm that resetting of the osmostat is operative in primigravid pregnancy and extend these observations by demonstrating that this phenomenon is established at least as early as mid-pregnancy. Furthermore, the osmoregulatory system does not appear to be altered by changes in plasma volume or plasma renin as pregnancy progresses.\r"

It is therefore imperative that a protocol for the management of asymptomatic, antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts be developed. The vast majority of these cysts are benign and functional; laparotomy during the neonatal period is not only unnecessary but may be harmful. In a prospective study undertaken at Tygerberg Hospital, Parowvallei, South Africa, six ultrasound criteria were drawn up for the safe, conservative management of these neonates. Adherence to these criteria enabled us to manage five of seven neonates conservatively. Laparotomy in one neonate showed a benign functional ovarian cyst. Retrospectively, this case should have been managed conservatively. In the remaining neonate a laparotomy for an acute abdomen demonstrated torsion of an ovarian cyst, emphasizing the necessity for adequate follow-up.\r"

Pulmonary toxicity is a rare adverse effect of low dose MTX therapy and a review of the literature reveals 6 additional cases. Since MTX induced pneumonitis is a potentially fatal, yet completely reversible, disease, attention should be paid to even mild early respiratory symptoms in patients treated with low dose MTX and patient monitoring should include pulmonary function tests.\r"

Improvement occurred in each group. There was a highly significant (p less than 0.001) linear trend in the 6 mg group, 73% of whom showed linear improvement. A significant correlation (p less than 0.05) was found between response of individual patients and AF dose (mg/kg/day), but there was no significant correlation between dosage and mean steady state serum gold concentration. No significant correlation was seen between outcome and pretreatment demographic and disease variables. In a subsequent 6 month phase of dosage adjustment, aiming for optimal dosage, no advantage resulted from increasing the dose above 6 mg/day. Patients apparently benefiting from treatment continued an open long-term trial of AF. By 45 months, 33.5% had stopped treatment due to lack of efficacy and 14.5% due to toxicity, mainly rash and diarrhea.\r"

Postirradiation sarcoma (PIS), while still uncommon, is a complication which is appearing more frequently as the number of long-term survivors increases. Studies of the clinical characteristics of PIS, such as stage of disease, grade, survival, and prognosis, are therefore of increasing importance, and may lead to different strategies for early detection and prevention. In a literature review of PIS, we identified 344 cases with sufficient data for analysis of these clinical characteristics. In these selected cases, we found that: (a) PIS was most often diagnosed at an advanced stage and high grade; (b) most of the tumors were located in areas where radical surgery could not be performed; (c) the response rate to chemotherapy was almost always poor; and (d) most patients with PIS died from locally advanced and/or metastatic disease within a few months after diagnosis. PIS is a serious, usually fatal, late complication of radiotherapy and it should be weighed in the decision to use this modality of therapy. In the follow-up of cancer patients, a low threshold of suspicion for PIS is recommended in order to detect it early for possible resection. Because of the poor prognosis, more aggressive and investigative chemotherapeutic regimens are warranted.\r"

Survival time from the initial diagnosis was significantly shorter for CML patients whose levels of granulocyte phenotypic proteins were below the normal range compared with survival time for those patients whose levels were normal or higher than normal. The data suggest that these changes in mature granulocytes serve as useful diagnostic indicators of an impending blast crisis in CML patients.\r"

Our data indicate that cardiac output increased in the low-dose group and decreased in the high-dose group. In both animal groups, a differential arteriolar response occurred to give small arteriole dilation and large arteriole constriction while venous diameters did not change. We conclude that: 1) changes in cardiac output during endotoxemia are not related to microvascular responses in skeletal muscle, and 2) the microvascular responses in skeletal muscle could be responsible for the decreased systemic vascular resistance during high cardiac output endotoxemia, but not for the elevated systemic vascular resistance during low cardiac output endotoxemia.\r"

The echographic examinations were performed using a real-time sector 10 MHz probe placed directly over the specimen, with constant gain rates. The results confirm the value of xeroradiography and demonstrate the effectiveness of high-resolution ultrasonography for the detection of minute foreign bodies. Some materials showed a peculiar echographic pattern, like sand, that corresponded to a frank acoustic shadow, or like metal and glass, showing a comet tail of reverberation artifacts. Wood and fish bones were well outlined, while plastic was less effectively represented. High-resolution ultrasonography is considered to be a first-line technique in searching for many kinds of minute foreign bodies, to be used in combination with xeroradiography in routine clinical examination.\r"

Two thirds of the patients had limb injuries. Of all wounded, patients with fractures of long bones needed the greatest number of repeated operations and the longest hospitalization time. Twenty-five patients had abdominal or perineal wounds and 12 needed laparotomy. Of 25 with head injuries 14 had penetrating brain trauma. Thoracic, vascular, and burn injuries were rare. The eight patients with spinal cord injury could fortunately be referred to the ICRC rehabilitation center in Peshawar within a week. Wound sepsis was the major problem due to the extraordinarly long delay in the initiation of treatment. In spite of the often grossly infected wounds, radical debridement usually led to good recovery for most patients, with a hospital mortality rate of only 2.5%.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 433 extracorporeal lithotripsy procedures was performed for renal, ureteral and bladder stones by means of a system of ultrasonographic detection and piezoelectric destruction in 386 patients. The stones were detected easily in 87 per cent of the patients, difficult to detect in 10 per cent and impossible to detect in 3 per cent. Mean duration of treatment was 35 minutes. Mean number of piezoelectric waves was 2,700 at 1.25 per second. With a frequency of 1.25 to 5 per second, extracorporeal lithotripsy was performed without any local, regional or general anesthesia, and without premedication in 210 patients. Of the 217 patients with a renal stone reviewed at 3 months 161 (74 per cent) had successful results and 56 (26 per cent) failed therapy. Thirty patients (14 per cent) underwent 2 or 3 sessions. The morbidity was low: 2 per cent of the patients suffered ureteral obstruction, 1.5 per cent had subcapsular hematoma and 4 per cent had fever. No significant modifications of laboratory tests were necessary and no patient suffered renal failure. Of the stones 31 in the lumbar ureter, 15 in the pelvic ureter and 8 in the bladder were treated, with success rates of 87, 46 and 50 per cent, respectively. A total of 103 patients was treated on an outpatient basis. This outpatient treatment, together with the low cost and minimal maintenance of the apparatus, and the absence of anesthesia constitute a new progress in the treatment of renal stones.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 693 stones in 438 renoureteral units from 426 patients 4 months to 84 years old was treated with a mobile piezoelectric lithotriptor using ultrasound stone localization. Of the units 37 per cent had solitary stones smaller than 1.5 cm. in diameter, (group 1), 32 per cent had multiple stones up to this size (group 2), 21 per cent had stones 1.6 to 2.5 cm. in diameter (group 3) and 10 per cent had calculi larger than 2.5 cm. in diameter (group 4). No sedation or analgesics were necessary in 96.2 per cent of the treatments. Of all stones 97.2 per cent were disintegrated, with 39 per cent of the units requiring repeat treatments usually on an outpatient basis. Of the patients 82 per cent had transient hematuria, 6 per cent had fever and 28 per cent temporarily took some type of analgesics within the first 3 months after treatment. Nine per cent of the patients required postoperative ancillary interventions. After 3 months 92 per cent of the renoureteral units in group 1, 73 per cent in group 2, 74 per cent in group 3 and 50 per cent in group 4 were free of stones. Piezoelectric extracorporeal lithotripsy proved to be as efficient as spark-gap lithotripsy, yet it was essentially painless. Ultrasound localization permits treatment of all renal stones but it restricts lithotripsy of ureteral stones to the most proximal and distal fourths of the ureter.\r"

Use of the standard perineal incision for perineal prostatectomy with division of the urogenital diaphragm in the midline from behind up to and encircling the urethra, and temporary suturing of the flaps of the urogenital diaphragm that are created to the lateral edges of the skin incision provides good exposure of the membranous and proximal bulbous urethra, thus, making reconstruction easier. This approach should minimize the need for the transpubic or perineosuprapubic approaches. It has been used for urethroplasty in 12 patients with traumatic membranous strictures, 5 with traumatic bulbomembranous strictures, 7 with post-gonococcal strictures involving the proximal bulbous and distal membranous urethra, and 1 with a bulbomembranous urethral rupture.\r"

  ".W": "To study the relative concentrations and appearance of immunoglobulin in the bladder and kidneys of rats with acute and chronic urinary tract infections, three groups of female Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. Group I underwent weekly intraurethral inoculation with Escherichia coli 07. Group II received inoculation of 0.2 ml of PBS alone. Group III were unmanipulated controls. Bladder and kidney washings were obtained for bacterial colony counts and organism identification. Bladder and kidney tissue was prepared for immunofluorescent examination using goat or rabbit antirat IgA, IgM, or IgG layered with fluorescent-labeled rabbit antigoat or goat antirabbit serum. Negative immunofluorescent controls substituted PBS for antirat serum. No significant difference was noted between bladder and kidney cultures in groups I and II. Comparison of immunofluorescent intensity between groups I and III demonstrated that IgM intensity was greatest between weeks one and three in bladders and kidneys, then decreased to non-significant levels. Bladder IgG intensity peaked at week four and remained elevated throughout the remainder of the study while renal IgG intensity was significant throughout the study period. Renal and bladder IgA was noted only sporadically. Comparison of culture positive animals to culture negative animals (groups II and III) demonstrated a lower immunofluorescent intensity score for culture negative animals. Discrete cellular immunofluorescence was evident in 19.1% of bladders and compared to 0.6% of kidneys. This study suggests that the immunologic response in the rat to intraurethral inoculation and infection is biphasic (IgM followed by IgG) and that a local cellular immunologic response may exist in the bladder.\r"

We used indirect immunohistochemical techniques to demonstrate cytoplasmic EGF in paraffin-embedded sections of the following primary prostatic tissues: benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (N = 10), BPH adjacent to CAP (N = 42), clinically localized CAP (N = 45), untreated metastatic CAP (N = 10), and metastatic CAP after varying periods of androgen deprivation (N = 10). In six of the latter 10 cases biopsies of the primary tumor obtained before androgen deprivation therapy were also available for study. Three of the BPH specimens (6%) and 44 of the CAP specimens (68%) stained. Forty per cent of the localized tumors stained but all untreated and treated metastatic tumors stained (p less than 0.01). There were direct but statistically insignificant correlations between the demonstration of EGF and both the Gleason score of localized and untreated metastatic tumors and the pathologic stage of localized tumors. The proportion of malignant cells stained in EGF positive tumors was similar regardless of Gleason score, pathologic stage or the presence or absence of metastases. However, the proportion of cells stained was greater in five of six specimens obtained during hormonal deprivation compared to specimens of the same tumor obtained before treatment. These data suggest that some prostatic cancers interact with EGF and that the interaction may be influenced by the androgenic milieu.\r"

Acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg each day) and Coumadin (prothrombin time 1.4 to 1.7 times the control value) were administered preoperatively and continued 4 weeks postoperatively. Platelets labeled with 111In and 125I-labeled fibrinogen were administered 24 hours before graft removal. Luminal platelet adherence, expressed as 10(6) platelets/cm2 of graft surface, was 8.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 56.4 +/- 8.0 (p less than 0.008) and 4.0 +/- 0.9 vs. 12.4 +/- 2.3 (p less than 0.005) in seeded vs. unseeded grafts at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Luminal fibrinogen deposition, expressed in micrograms per square centimeter of graft surface, was 11.8 +/- 2.2 vs. 32.0 +/- 2.0 (p less than 0.06) and 6.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 12.4 +/- 6.3 (p less than 0.005) in seeded vs. unseeded grafts at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Cumulative 4- and 12-week luminal production of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha from seeded and unseeded grafts represented 11% and 5%, respectively, of that produced from the native iliac vein. Luminal endothelial cell coverage was 71% +/- 22% vs. 33% +/- 9% and 79% +/- 8% vs. 55% +/- 8% (p less than 0.05) in seeded and unseeded grafts at 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. Although endothelialization was not complete in seeded vena cava grafts, it is clear that seeded prostheses exhibited improved thromboresistance compared with unseeded conduits.\r"

Renal biopsy results and serological findings were diagnostic of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-mediated glomerulonephritis. An analytic review of the literature revealed substantial evidence linking solvent exposure to the development of glomerulonephritis (GN), with seven of nine case-control studies demonstrating a statistically significant association. Odds ratios were reported by or could be calculated for six of these studies, and the five positive studies detected a 2.8- to 8.9-fold increased risk for GN among solvent-exposed individuals. The findings in several of these studies of dose-response relationships, the reports of variations in disease severity in relation to exposure intensity, and the absence of alternative explanations for the association provide additional supportive evidence for a solvent effect. In the majority of cases of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody-mediated GN and other types of GN, there is no remarkable preceding exposure to organic solvents. However, we conclude that in the case presented herein and in cases of GN with similar exposure histories, solvent exposure may play a significant contributing role in the development of GN.\r"

The findings were present not only on admission during the thrombocytopenic stage of the disease, but persisted for several weeks after recovery of the platelet count. Reduced endothelial PGI2 production was significantly more common in plasma from atypical than typical cases. Plasma from both typical and atypical HUS patients induced aggregation of normal platelets, but this phenomenon was unrelated to both the presence of thrombocytopenia or the stage of the disease. Serum platelet aggregating activity was higher in the atypical HUS patients, and was not associated with immune complexes detectable by polyethylene glycol precipitation. The data indicate that intravascular platelet activation is a feature of both forms of HUS, and may be initiated by different mechanisms in the two subgroups. While abnormal PGI2 synthesis appears to be important in the atypical cases, neither defective PGI2 production nor platelet aggregation by plasma factors adequately accounts for platelet activation in the majority of typical cases.\r"

Three solutions, a) tissue culture medium/saline, b) 5% human serum albumin, and c) 10% fresh human plasma, were circulated in the blood loop for five hours. Samples drawn from the blood side were assayed for interleukin-1 (IL-1)-inducing activity on human mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro. No IL-1-inducing substances were detected when saline or culture medium was circulated in the blood loop. Circulating 5% human serum albumin revealed IL-1-inducing activity in the samples drawn only after five hours of HD. However, the addition of 10% fresh human plasma to the blood side resulted in the appearance of an IL-1-inducing substance(s) after 15 minutes of HD. After 30 minutes, maximum IL-1-inducing activity was observed (control stimulation index, 3.30 +/- 0.67 SEM vs. 7.59 +/- 1.50, P less than 0.02). The IL-1-inducing activity of the samples was completely inhibited by polymyxin B, a cationic antibiotic which blocks the IL-1-inducing activity of endotoxin. Additional experiments demonstrated that in vitro MNC IL-1-production induced by the same E. coli microfiltrate is enhanced in the presence of 10% plasma. These studies demonstrate that: (a) in the presence of plasma, IL-1-inducing factors pass into the blood compartment of a dialysis system challenged with bacterial pyrogen; and (b) MNC production of IL-1 is enhanced in the presence of plasma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dialysate volume was simultaneously determined by two different indicator dilution technique as a function of dwell time in a rabbit model of peritoneal dialysis using isotonic, hypertonic and hypotonic solutions. After a single injection of a large molecular weight index solute (SIIS) to the dialysis solution at a known concentration, the first indicator dilution technique determined dialysate volume by the change in the index solute concentration. In the second technique, dialysate volume was determined after multiple injections of a different index solute (MIIS) by measuring the change in concentration of the index solute two minutes after its injection into the dialysis solution. The volumes determined by SIIS were similar during isotonic, but larger during both hypertonic and hypotonic exchanges, than those determined by MIIS. Drained volume was dependent upon the peritoneal catheter used, was not different from that determined by MIIS, but was significantly smaller than that determined by SIIS. The present results suggest that systematic errors in volume measurements when using indicator dilution result from the loss of the index solute from the peritoneal cavity and are greater for SIIS than for MIIS. A model for fluid transfer during peritoneal dialysis showed that dialysate volumes determined by SIIS were useful, however, when estimating the rate of fluid movement across the peritoneal membrane.\r"

These patients were grouped as follows: Group 1, 43 patients who were treated with calcium citrate; and Group 2 (the control group), 38 patients who were treated with aluminum-containing compounds. Blood chemistries were measured monthly and medications adjusted to maintain the following levels: serum calcium, greater than 9 mg/dl; serum phosphorus, less than 5.5 mg/dl; and total CO2 content, greater than 22 mmol/liter. At the end of the treatment period, the following serum values were obtained in Groups 1 and 2, respectively: calcium, 9.6 +/- 1.2 mg/dl (mean +/- SD) versus 8.9 +/- 0.8 mg/dl (P less than 0.001); phosphorus 5.5 +/- 1.9 mg/dl versus 7.0 +/- 2.3 mg/dl (P less than 0.005); and calcium-phosphate product, 52 +/- 18 versus 61 +/- 21 (P less than 0.05). Differences in alkaline phosphatase, total CO2 content, and C-terminal parathyroid hormone (C-PTH) values were not statistically significant between the two groups. Fifteen patients in Group 1 were then switched to aluminum-containing compounds and chemistries were compared one month later. During calcium citrate therapy, serum calcium was significantly higher, while C-PTH and serum alkaline phosphatase were significantly reduced. No difference was noted in serum phosphorous and total CO2 content. A questionnaire completed by 17 patients in Group 1 documented excellent patient tolerance to calcium citrate. Hypercalcemia (greater than 10.5 mg/dl) was the only significant complication, but only one patient became symptomatic. We conclude that, as a phosphate binder, calcium citrate is at least as effective as aluminum-containing compounds.\r"

Hemipancreatectomized animals remained normoglycaemic but rendered significantly reduced K values and insulin release during IVGTT, findings consistent with major pancreatic resection. Segmental hetero- or ortho-topic pancreatic transplantation did not improve reduced K values and hypoinsulinaemia following hemipancreatectomy although orthotopically sited grafts rendered the best glucose tolerance test curves. Glucagon output during IVGTT remained the same in both transplant models. It is concluded that the postoperative hormonal response was similar in both orthotopic and heterotopic transplant recipients, which indicates that drainage of graft venous effluent into the portal circulation has no advantage over systemic insulin drainage as reflected in this \"diabetic\" model.\r"

Of 20 animals that received TL1 1,000 rad (10 Gy) and CSA 25 mg/kg/day orally for 5 days then 10 mg/kg/day intramuscularly indefinitely, 3 had graft survival of greater than 100 days. Likewise, of a group of 15 animals that received TL1 800 rad (8 Gy) and combined indefinite administration of CSA, 6 had graft survival of greater than 100 days.

A new stitching method was applied in 79 patients with tetralogy of Fallot. Sixty-eight specimens (84%) had perimembranous outlet ventricular septal defect with a membranous flap 4.5 +/- 2.6 mm long. Thirteen (16%) had a muscle bar separating the defect from the central fibrous body area. The width was 5.8 +/- 1.7 mm. Microscopic study revealed that the membranous flap is a safe structure for suturing because of the thick posterior extension of the trabecular septomarginalis. In the clinical application of a new stitching method that uses the membranous flap, all patients showed sinus rhythm and no patient had complete heart block. We conclude that a membranous flap can be used safely as a suture line to avoid conduction tissue damage without using the tricuspid septal leaflet.\r"

Of the 242 patients who underwent intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis for esophageal carcinoma (182 patients) and adenocarcinoma of the cardia (60 patients) between January 1980 and June 1985, 14 (5.8%) had esophageal anastomotic leakage and two died (0.8%). Various clinical and biologic parameters and aspects of operative technique were studied prospectively and analyzed statistically to identify possible factors responsible for leaks. Both bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis with logistic regression showed that the following clinical and biologic factors do not influence anastomotic leakage: tumor stage, the curative or palliative purpose of resection, neoplastic permeation of anastomotic margins, total protein concentration below 5 gm/dl, albumin concentration below 3 gm/dl, patient's age, diabetes, high blood pressure, cirrhosis of the liver, and cardiac, respiratory, or renal diseases. Technical factors, on the contrary, were statistically significant and of great clinical importance: manual as opposed to mechanical suturing (chi 2 = 8.8, p = 0.013) and single-layer as opposed to double-layer suturing (chi 2 = 9.9, p = 0.043). The level of the anastomosis was found to be a further statistically significant factor: The incidence of leakage was greater when the anastomosis was located between the azygos vein and the lower pulmonary vein (chi 2 = 15.5, p = 0.004) than above the azygos vein or below the lower pulmonary vein.\r"

The two likely mechanisms by which PEEP reduces alveolar capillary perfusion are reduction of cardiac output or compression of pulmonary capillaries within interalveolar septa, or both mechanisms. This study attempts to quantitate the impact of each of these mechanisms on alveolar capillary perfusion in anesthetized dogs by restoring cardiac output to baseline values with dextran 70 infusion after application of 15 cm H2O PEEP. Alveolar capillary perfusion was assessed directly through the visceral pleura by in vivo photomicroscopy. PEEP resulted in a fall in cardiac output and alveolar capillary perfusion with a concomitant rise in alveolar dead space-tidal volume ratio and arterial carbon dioxide tension. Infusion of dextran 70 returned the cardiac output to baseline levels but only slightly increased alveolar capillary perfusion. Both dead space/tidal volume ratio and arterial carbon dioxide tension remained significantly elevated with PEEP even with normal cardiac output. Microscopically, alveolar capillaries appeared compressed and flattened by PEEP, which indicated a mechanical interruption of blood flow. Extra-alveolar vessels remained perfused with PEEP. PEEP increased dead space/tidal volume ratio 36%; restoration of cardiac output reduced dead space/tidal volume ratio only 7% and did not return alveolar capillary perfusion to baseline levels. These data indicate that most of the reduced alveolar perfusion with PEEP results from direct compression of alveolar capillaries and not from reduced cardiac output.\r"

They are capable of damaging cellular components, and accumulating evidence suggests they may contribute to various disease entities. Biologic systems are exposed to free radicals that have been formed endogenously or that result from external influences such as ionizing radiation. Oxygen free radicals are continuously being produced intracellularly by oxidation-reduction reactions. The sequential univalent reduction of molecular oxygen initially forms the superoxide anion radical, which in turn is converted, in the presence of transition metal ions, into the highly reactive hydroxyl radical. Free radicals are detected by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, but often this procedure is difficult to use for study of free radical involvement in biologic systems, and investigators have resorted to inferring their presence by identifying the products of free radical reactions. All aerobic organisms possess substances that help prevent free radical-mediated injury. These include antioxidants such as vitamin E and the enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. A second part of this review will describe the role of free radicals in specific disease entities.\r"

Confirmation of free radical involvement in a particular disease may have clinical relevance, inasmuch as clinically applicable techniques are currently being developed to remove free radicals from cellular sites where they are injurious and, in other situations such as chemotherapy, techniques or drugs that produce free radicals are available to destroy harmful cells.\r"

Infections caused by organisms sensitive to aztreonam that are known to be multiresistant to other agents can be treated directly with aztreonam in single, directed therapy, thus making the use of more toxic agents unnecessary. In types of infection in which both gram positive and gram negative bacteria are present, aztreonam can replace the usual aminoglycoside component of the therapeutic regimen. In settings of mixed infections suspected of being caused by drug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae and/or P. aeruginosa, aztreonam can be combined with an agent active against gram positive organisms or with one active against anaerobes. Aztreonam has proven to be effective, safe therapy for serious and life-threatening infections caused by multiresistant aerobic gram negative bacteria. It should be used in combination with drugs that inhibit gram positive species if the etiology of the infection is not known, particularly in the immunocompromised, neutropenic patient. Doses of 1 g every 8 to 12 hours will be adequate for treatment of infections caused by most Enterobacteriaceae. Whether 2 g doses every 8 hours would be preferred for treatment of systemic Pseudomonas infections remains to be determined. Urinary infections caused by gram negative bacteria can be treated with 500 mg administered IM once or twice daily. The dosage of aztreonam should be adjusted in patients with renal failure. Clearly, aztreonam is a useful addition to the antimicrobial agents available to the physician.\r"

A Cox's proportional hazards model was used to identify effects of sex, period of treatment, whether the patient received chemotherapy, and experience of the hospital. For patients aged under 25 years, a significant (p = 0.02) trend of improved survival was seen among the most recent cohort, and the greater the treatment experience of the hospital, possibly the better the results (p = 0.11), although selective referral cannot be excluded as a reason for this finding. Chemotherapy was not independently associated with survival. Period of treatment, chemotherapy, and experience of hospital were not associated with improved survival for patients aged 25-64. Recent clinical trials for primary osteosarcoma have contributed to an apparent improved survival through selection of patients with good prognosis. Claims for the efficacy of new regimens should be assessed in clinical practice by population monitoring through the analysis of cancer registers.\r"

Eosinophilia was in many cases associated with a raised toxocara titre, but 27% of patients with high titres had normal eosinophil counts. Toxocariasis is common, especially in children, and is associated with clinical features that are generally regarded as non-specific but together form a recognisable symptom complex. Toxocariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of such symptoms and especially in recurrent abdominal pain, which might otherwise be labelled as idiopathic. The absence of eosinophilia does not exclude toxocariasis.\r"

For those seen within the first week, the risk of recurrence was 52% by the end of 3 years. In univariate analysis, the only clinical variable that was associated with recurrence was the time of day at which the initial seizure occurred. There was a tendency, that did not reach statistical significance, for younger age (less than 50 years) and a family history of seizures of any type, including febrile convulsions, to be associated with recurrence. Such risk factors appear to be additive, so that the risk of recurrence at 1 year for a subject with all three factors is about three times that of a subject with none of them. Sex, type of seizure, and features of the electroencephalogram were not of predictive value. Computerised tomographic scanning revealed tumours in 3% of subjects, and these individuals were particularly likely to have recurrent seizures.\r"

Patients with essential hypertension had normal fasting serum insulin values and normal fasting glucose/insulin ratios; by contrast, the hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects had higher fasting serum insulin and lower glucose/insulin ratios than either normotensive diabetic or non-diabetic patients. Both hypertensive and normotensive diabetic subjects had higher fasting C-peptide values than those without diabetes. Hypertensive diabetic patients had the highest insulin/C-peptide ratios, indicating low hepatic insulin extraction rates. These findings suggest that hyperinsulinaemia is not causally related to essential hypertension but that it may contribute to the hypertension of non-insulin-dependent diabetes in association with low hepatic insulin clearance.\r"

These antibodies can be absorbed from the human gut, and will function both as antigens and antibodies in the human immune system. Antibodies to bovine gamma globulins (BGG) have been detected in human sera and the family of anti-BGG antibodies must include anti-idiotypic antibodies, very low doses of which can influence the immune response. The hypothesis is that the human immune system may be primed by low-level exposure to xenogeneic antibodies specific for those human allergens which are ubiquitous in the farm environment, such as pollens, mites, and moulds, the result being a deleterious and inappropriate response on subsequent exposure to these allergens. Dairy products are the most important source of xenogeneic antibodies in the western diet, and the hypothesis may partly explain the association between cow's milk and allergies to substances other than milk proteins.\r"

Full details were available on 77% of all patients admitted, or readmitted, with asthma during that year (150 of 195 admissions). 64 patients were admitted to general wards with a special interest in respiratory medicine, and 86 to general wards without this specialist interest. Cases in the two groups were similar in terms of age, previous severity of asthma, previous treatment, and initial pulse rate. Fewer cases in the non-specialist group were treated with oral corticosteroids (67%, vs 83%), had regular peak flow recordings (42%, vs 73%), or were given return appointments (56%, vs 92%); and fewer had their regular inhaled therapy increased after discharge (28%, vs 55%). At interview 13 days later, more patients from the non-specialist group reported sleep disturbance (41%, vs 23%), morning chest tightness (55%, vs 37%), ow wheeze on 1 flight of stairs (58%, vs 34%). 20% of first admissions in the non-specialist group were readmitted within the year, compared to 2% of the group treated on wards with a specialist interest in respiratory medicine. These data suggest that the intensive management of asthmatic patients, practised in respiratory units, prevents much unnecessary morbidity.\r"

The indications were presented as a series of detailed clinical situations in which the procedure might be used, and for each indication individual panel members rated appropriateness on a scale of 1 to 9. The US panel judged more indications appropriate than did the UK panel, and there was more agreement among the members of the US panel than among those of the UK panel. Although the two panels tended to rate the appropriateness of the indications in the same order, the UK panel placed more emphasis than did the US panel on the importance of symptoms and the amount of medical treatment. Application of the panels' ratings to two groups of patients who had had coronary angiography showed that 17% and 27% of the investigations had been inappropriate by the standards of the US panel, whereas 42% and 60% were inappropriate by the UK panel ratings. 13% of the CABG operations studied were inappropriate by the US and 35% by the UK panel ratings.\r"

In the test group, treatment consisted of a triple regimen of selective decontamination of the digestive tract (polymyxin E, tobramycin, and amphotericin B) administered throughout the ITU stay, systemic cefotaxime administered for the initial four days, and regular microbiological screening of multiple sites. The test group showed a striking and consistent reduction in colonisation of the digestive tract with aerobic gram-negative bacilli, and there was a substantial reduction in the incidence of acquired infection (24% to 10%). Mortality in certain categories of patients was also reduced. There is now a considerable body of evidence to justify the more widespread use of this selective parenteral and enteral anti-sepsis regimen (SPEAR) in general intensive care practice.\r"

Within a maximum of 8 years' follow-up (3384 patient-years of observation) 16 unaffected relatives (5 parents and 11 siblings) became insulin dependent. The cumulative risk of becoming insulin dependent by age 25 was 16% for siblings sharing two HLA haplotypes with the proband, 9% for those sharing one haplotype, and zero for those sharing none. 13 of 24 (54%) subjects positive for complement-fixing ICA on three or more occasions became insulin dependent, as against 1 of 30 (3%) with noncomplement-fixing ICA alone and 2 of 665 (0.3%) ICA-negative subjects; by life-table analysis the risks after 8 years of known ICA status are 76%, 3%, and 0.6%, respectively. In terms of total time at risk ICA-positive family members had a relative risk of 75.2 compared with ICA-negative individuals. With positivity for complement-fixing ICA the relative risk was 188.5.\r"

A manifestation of this tropism is the association of the virus with a variety of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders and tumours. However, there is now considerable evidence to suggest that the permissive cell type for EBV replication is epithelial and that infection of B cells may be a secondary, and, from the point of view of the virus, an unimportant consequence. A re-evaluation of the role that epithelium plays in viral persistence and of the importance of the immune response in the development of persistent infection indicates that T-cell-mediated immunity to the epithelial infection is critical in maintaining the normal delicate balance between virus and host. It also suggests that uncontrolled EBV replication in pharyngeal epithelium may be central to the evolution of some (or all) EBV-associated lymphomas.\r"

It was found that the short-term results were maintained even for the long period. Unsatisfactory hearing gains were caused mainly by the displacement or extrusion of CORP which could be prevented by fixation with the cartilage plate, deepening of the base of CORP-P, fixing of the base of CORP-T with the fascia, and additional fixing with the malleus handle and chorda tympani nerve.\r"

We report histology, ultrasound image properties, and vasoreactivity of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries after exposure to the laser-heated tip catheter. Segments of isolated human coronary arteries were obtained within 5-8 hours postmortem. Side branches were ligated and perfused with Krebs-Ringer solution. Coronary occlusions were recanalized during perfusion using a 1.5-mm tip heated twice with a 10 W argon laser for 10 seconds while two-dimensional 12-MHz ultrasound images were recorded. Images documented vessel recanalization and an increase in ultrasound refractile properties of vessel walls adjacent and 2-5 mm distal to the heated tip. Histologic studies showed charring along the neolumen and extensive coagulation pattern within the plaque. Vasoreactivity was assessed by measuring flow rate changes during perfusion with 100 ml of 10(-5) M serotonin followed by washout with serotonin-free solution. Recanalized arteries showed a 50% increase in magnitude of vasospasm, which was persistent for 5 hours, compared to control atherosclerotic vessels, which relaxed within 30 minutes. In conclusion, laser-heated-tip-irradiated vessels demonstrated plaque coagulation, increased ultrasound refractile properties of plaque, and increased vasospasm, which persisted for several hours.\r"

Eighty-three percent of population had 1 or more episodes of infection and 67% of the population had severe infections. The overall mortality was 26/101 (26%) and 23 of 26 deaths (88%) were associated with infection. Seventy percent of severe infections occurred in the first 2 months after transplantation. The most frequent severe infections were abdominal abscess, bacterial pneumonia, invasive candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, and symptomatic cytomegalovirus infection. Patients with more than 12 hours of cumulative surgical time had a higher rate of severe infections (P less than 0.001), particularly fungal (P less than 0.001) and bacterial (P less than 0.01) infections. Also, the use of choledocho-jejunostomy was associated with a higher rate of infection in patients who had more than 1 transplant operation (P less than 0.02). No increase in infection was found in patients who received azathioprine, or more than the median number of steroid boluses or \"recycles\"; but patients who received OKT3 therapy had a higher rate of protozoal infections (P less than 0.05). A result similar to that of our previous studies was a strong relation between the number of severe fungal infections and prolonged courses of antibiotics after transplant operation (P less than 0.001). Pretransplant manifestations of severe liver disease such as ascites, encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding were not associated with higher rates of infection after transplantation, but high serum levels of ALT were. Patients with lower ratios of T-helper to T-suppressor lymphocytes had more severe viral (P less than 0.02) and fungal (P less than 0.01) infections after transplantation.\r"

  ".W": "To achieve more appropriate triage to the coronary care unit of patients presenting with acute chest pain, we used clinical data on 1379 patients at two hospitals to construct a simple computer protocol to predict the presence of myocardial infarction. When we tested this protocol prospectively in 4770 patients at two university hospitals and four community hospitals, the computer-derived protocol had a significantly higher specificity (74 vs. 71 percent) in predicting the absence of infarction than physicians deciding whether to admit patients to the coronary care unit, and it had a similar sensitivity in detecting the presence of infarction (88.0 vs. 87.8 percent). Decisions based solely on the computer protocol would have reduced the admission of patients without infarction to the coronary care unit by 11.5 percent without adversely affecting the admission of patients in whom emergent complications developed that required intensive care. Although this protocol should not be used to override careful clinical judgment in individual cases, the computer protocol for the most part yields accurate estimates of the probability of myocardial infarction. Decisions about admission to the coronary care unit based on the protocol would have been as effective as those actually made by the unaided physicians who cared for the patients, and less costly. Whether physicians who are aided by the protocol perform better than unaided physicians cannot be determined without further study.\r"

To evaluate the effects of physical therapy, we randomly assigned 48 infants (12 to 19 months of age) with mild to severe spastic diplegia to receive either 12 months of physical therapy (Group A) or 6 months of physical therapy preceded by 6 months of infant stimulation (Group B). The infant-stimulation program included motor, sensory, language, and cognitive activities of increasing complexity. Masked outcome assessment was performed after both 6 and 12 months of therapy to evaluate motor quotient, motor ability, and mental quotient. After six months, the infants in Group A had a lower mean motor quotient than those in Group B (49.1 vs. 58.1, P = 0.02) and were less likely to walk (12 vs. 35 percent, P = 0.07). These differences persisted after 12 months of therapy (47.9 vs. 63.3, P less than 0.01, and 36 vs. 73 percent, P = 0.01, respectively). We noted no significant differences between the groups in the incidence of contractures or the need for bracing or orthopedic surgery. Group A also had a lower mean mental quotient than Group B after six months of therapy (65.6 vs. 75.5, P = 0.05). The routine use of physical therapy in infants with spastic diplegia offered no short-term advantage over infant stimulation. Because of the limited scope of the trial, our conclusions favoring infant stimulation are preliminary. The results suggest that further study of the effects of both physical therapy and infant stimulation is indicated.\r"

To determine whether iron overload leads to insulin resistance before the development of insulin deficiency, insulin was infused (by euglycemic insulin-clamp technique) into 12 children with thalassemia (4 of whom were prepubertal, and 8 pubertal) who had normal or only moderately impaired glucose tolerance and who were receiving chelation therapy. Although insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in the prepubertal children with thalassemia was similar to that in controls (normal prepubertal children) (319 +/- 23 vs. 314 +/- 41 mg per square meter of body-surface area per minute, P not significant), the response to insulin was markedly impaired in the pubertal children with thalassemia (155 +/- 18 vs. 224 +/- 15 mg per square meter per minute in normal pubertal controls, P less than 0.01). Plasma insulin levels rose excessively after oral glucose administration in the pubertal subjects with thalassemia, but not in the prepubertal patients (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, in response to a standard hyperglycemic stimulus, insulin levels in the pubertal patients rose to two to three times greater than normal and C-peptide levels became significantly elevated. Our data suggest that insulin resistance and increased insulin secretion develop in older children with thalassemia treated with long-term hypertransfusion therapy before the development of diabetes.\r"

We administered this substance to 19 patients with breast cancer or melanoma treated with high-dose combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support. Groups of three or four patients were treated with 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, 16.0, or 32.0 micrograms per kilogram of body weight per day of glycosylated rHuGM-CSF by continuous intravenous infusion for 14 days, beginning three hours after bone marrow infusion. Total leukocyte and granulocyte recovery was accelerated in these patients as compared with 24 historical controls matched for age, diagnosis, and treatment. Leukocyte counts (mean +/- SD) obtained 14 days after transplantation were 1511 +/- 1003 per microliter in patients given 2 to 8 micrograms per kilogram per day, 2575 +/- 2304 in those given 16 micrograms, and 3120 +/- 1744 in those given 32 micrograms, as compared with 863 +/- 645 per microliter in the controls. No consistent effect on platelet counts was noted. Toxic effects were generally mild and not clearly dose-related in patients given 2 to 16 micrograms per kilogram per day. Edema, weight gain, or myalgias occurred in all patients given 32 micrograms per kilogram; marked weight gain, generalized edema, pleural effusions, and hypotension developed in two patients, one of whom also had acute renal failure. Our results indicate that rHuGM-CSF can accelerate myeloid recovery after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation, over a range of doses that can be tolerated. In this setting the ability to increase the dose is limited by the development of myalgias and fluid retention.\r"
