  ".W": "In a randomized study, the haemodynamic effects of the new phosphodiesterase-III-inhibitor, enoximone, were compared with dobutamine in acutely beta-adrenoceptor blocked patients. Twenty patients scheduled for aorto-coronary bypass grafting suffering from tachycardia (heart rate (HR) greater than 100 beat min-1) were treated by infusion of esmolol, an ultra-short acting, selective beta 1-blocker. Twenty minutes after the start of esmolol, either enoximone 0.5 mg kg-1 as a bolus (n = 10) or dobutamine 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 was administered. Haemodynamic effects were monitored for 40 min, including measurement of left ventricular haemodynamics. Esmolol reduced HR (-27%) and dP/dtmax (-38%) significantly in both groups. Cardiac index (CI) was decreased also. Enoximone increased Cl (+35%) and dP/dtmax (+39%) significantly, while no change in dobutamine-treated patients was observed. Systemic vascular resistance increased only in the dobutamine group (+44%).\r"

The orthopaedic patients received a codeine-paracetamol premedication, an opioid during operation, or no analgesic. Less than 50% of the orthopaedic patients in these groups required any postoperative analgesia. However, there was a high incidence of vomiting (40%) in those receiving an opioid during operation, associated with overnight admission in more than 50% of those who vomited. In the patients undergoing oral surgery, ibuprofen administered before operation significantly reduced analgesic requirement, without unwanted side effects. The use of codeine-paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent before body surface surgery appeared to be advantageous in reducing postoperative analgesic needs, without causing problems associated with the stronger opioids.\r"

  ".W": "In this study a variety of immunoelectron microscopic methods were used to define the precise ultrastructural binding site of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antibodies (EBA-Ab). We used two EBA sera which immunoblotted with the same skin-extracted protein as that labelled by a monoclonal antibody (LH7.2) which is known to react with the carboxy terminus of type VII collagen. Gold-conjugated antibodies were used in two different immunoelectron microscopic procedures to compare the labelling characteristics of EBA-Ab and LH7.2 in normal human skin. Antibody incubations were performed using ultra-thin cryosections of unfixed skin and thin slices of fresh skin (en bloc technique) before conventional fixation and embedding in Epon. Both methods showed similar labelling features for both EBA-Ab and LH7.2. With ultra-thin cryosections there was labelling of the lamina densa and an undefined component of the sublamina densa region. With the en bloc technique, labelling of dermal ends of anchoring fibrils and of amorphous material recently defined as 'anchoring plaques' was evident. There was no labelling of the central banded portions of anchoring fibrils. We conclude that EBA-Ag is localized to the dermal ends of anchoring fibrils in addition to the lamina densa and possibly anchoring plaques, and thus has the same distribution as the carboxy terminus of type VII collagen.\r"

To evaluate the role of TNF and LT in atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis, we investigated their production by mononuclear cells (MNC) in vitro. The 24-h supernatants of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated and unstimulated MNC from 26 patients with AD and 20 with psoriasis and from 17 non-atopic healthy controls were tested for the concentrations of TNF and LT using an ELISA technique. In patients with AD, TNF levels were significantly decreased in the supernatant of PHA-stimulated (P less than or equal to 0.005) and LPS-stimulated (P less than or equal to 0.02) MNC in comparison to controls. There was no significant difference in TNF production between psoriatic patients and the control group. Release of LT in the supernatant of PHA-stimulated MNC by patients and controls did not differ significantly. There was no significant spontaneous production of TNF and LT by MNC of patients and controls. These studies indicate that different immunomodulating mechanisms are responsible for triggering the inflammatory response in AD and psoriasis.\r"

Tolerance to radiation was induced by repeated exposures of the skin to the eliciting wavelengths of light. Weal and flare responses to intradermal injections of histamine and the histamine-releasing agent (codeine) were unaltered in the tolerant skin when compared with adjacent normal skin. Intradermal injection of in vitro irradiated serum or plasma from the patients induced an urticarial reaction in the unexposed skin but not in tolerant skin and repeated injections induced tolerance to the eliciting radiation. The results suggest that tolerance is not due to exhaustion of the photoallergen in the skin, or to an increase of the mast-cell degranulation threshold caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, or mast-cell mediator depletion, or histamine tachyphylaxis. It is likely that binding sites of IgE on mast cells remain occupied by the photoallergen during the state of tolerance, and that histamine release from mast cells is blocked.\r"

The ratio between viscous deformation (Uv) and elastic deformation (Ue) and the biological elasticity, i.e. the ratio between immediate recovery (Ur) and total deformation (Uf), were both significantly lower in vulvar than in forearm skin. Ur/Uf decreased significantly with load in vulvar, but not in forearm skin, whereas Uv/Ue was not load-dependent in either site. Uv/Ue remained constant with age in both test sites, whereas Ur/Uf was significantly lower in post-menopausal women in both forearm and vulvar skin. In vulvar, but not in forearm skin, Uv/Ue was significantly correlated with body height which may be an indicator of mechanical connective tissue properties. Viscous deformation plays a lesser role and biological elasticity is decreased in vulvar compared to forearm skin. Despite differences in mechanical parameters at both sites, age-related changes seem to be similar.\r"

With serial dilutions in chloroform (14 patients) and paraffin (four patients), the response was related to the log-dose of the allergen, and change in skin-fold thickness corresponded well with clinical grading. Single allergens diluted below the threshold for a patch-test response gave a response when given in combination, the threshold for a response to one allergen being lowered by the presence of another. On the linear part of the dose-response curves the response to the mixture of allergens was additive, the combined response being the sum of the individual components. Approaching the plateau region the response to the combination was greater than to the individual allergens but less than the sum of the single responses. The same results were obtained with allergens in paraffin. We conclude that conventional single allergen patch testing by itself is inadequate for the diagnosis of contact dermatitis.\r"

No activity against human cathepsin G could be demonstrated. Cultured human keratinocytes were shown to contain EIA activity similar to that found in psoriatic scale. EIA could also be demonstrated in human epidermis following the induction of an experimental inflammatory response by sellotape-stripping.

Of 10 patients, nine were women aged between 37-66 (average 51.5) years at the onset of their condition. The legs, and in particular the calves and thighs, were the commonest sites to be involved. However, in three patients the papules were confined to the back of the hands, and the male patient had lesions across the front of the chest. Bilateral lesions occurred in four patients. Histologically, the salient features were proliferation of capillaries and small venules at the level of the subpapillary plexus and the mid dermis, in association with prominent connective tissue cells and larger angulated multinucleate cells. Detailed histochemical and immunocytochemical studies have not elucidated the histogenesis of the multinucleate cells that seem to be a characteristic feature of this condition.\r"

The mean age was 41 years and mean time from transplant was 4.4 years (1-10 years). Fourteen patients were found to have a posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC). The axial thickness of the right lens of the renal transplant population, even in the presence of a PSC, was significantly larger than in a control population of 99 patients with clear lenses. The PSC of renal transplantation is readily distinguished from age related PSC because the opacity lies in the superficial cortex at a depth proportional to time from transplant and the lens maintains a normal anterior clear zone. It is proposed that this type of cataract be called 'recovering' PSC. It is concluded that the cataractogenic insult occurs mainly during the peritransplant period. Maintenance doses of immunosuppressives or steroids are therefore probably not cataractogenic.\r"

Both dye binding data and amino acid analysis showed no statistical difference between normal and glaucoma samples. Age had no significant effect on mean optical densities or on the collagen-specific amino acids proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine. Amino acid variability, however, was statistically different between the two groups. These results indicate that mean collagen levels in the trabecular meshwork of glaucomatous eyes do not differ from those in normal eyes.\r"

Using a mathematically derived 'normal' database, which assumes constantly decreasing threshold sensitivities with increasing eccentricity, the size I stimulus showed significantly greater sensitivity than the size III stimulus for detecting small, shallow scotomata in the central visual field. The use of Statpac, which contains an empirically derived, age-related normal database, increased the sensitivity significantly over that of the size III stimulus (with its mathematical model), and to a degree similar to that of the size I stimulus. The results obtained with the size I stimulus were reproducible and independent of the patient's age. This study suggests a potential role for the size I stimulus in evaluating eyes having or at risk of developing early glaucomatous field loss.\r"

To compare the lens with other fundal examination techniques a method is described for measuring the magnification and vertical angle of view of the various examination lenses. By this method the +150 dioptre lens is shown to have an angle of view of 60 degrees. This is similar to that of the indirect ophthalmoscope when used with a 20 dioptre lens which has an angle of view of 57 degrees. However, the magnification of the +150 dioptre lens is greater at X5.2 compared with X3.0 for the indirect ophthalmoscope. The practical applications of the lens are discussed. In comparison the field of view of the +78 and +90 dioptre lenses are 37 degrees and 29 degrees respectively. The +150 dioptre lens has proved a useful adjunct enabling a rapid global screening of the ocular fundus on the slit-lamp before examining any particular area of interest in more detail.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To test the hypothesis that kidney stone disease is more frequent among hypertensive men when the effect of possible confounders is allowed for. DESIGN--Cross sectional study of a sample of the male working population conducted as part of the 10 year follow up of a nationwide survey of the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors. SETTING--The Olivetti factory in Pozzuoli, a suburban area of Naples. POPULATION--688 Male workers (87.9% of the male workforce) aged 21-68. INTERVENTIONS--Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements, blood tests, and administration of a detailed questionnaire aimed at detecting a history of urolithiasis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Prevalence of a history of urolithiasis among normotensive and untreated and treated hypertensive men adjusted for the possible confounding effects of age, body mass index, renal function, and serum urate and total calcium concentrations. RESULTS--Of the 688 participants 509 were normotensive. Of the remainder, 118 had untreated and 61 treated hypertension. The overall prevalence of a history of urolithiasis was 16.3% (112/688). The relative risk of hypertensive subjects having a history of kidney stones was twice that of the normotensive group (odds ratio 2.11; 95% confidence interval 1.17 to 3.81), the risk being higher when only treated hypertensives were considered (odds ratio 3.16; 95% confidence interval 1.75 to 5.71). The prevalence of a history of urolithiasis was 13.4% (68/509) in the normotensive subjects, 20.3% (24/118) in the untreated hypertensives, and 32.8% (20/61) in the treated hypertensives (p less than 0.001). The age adjusted relative risk in treated hypertensive men was higher than that in the normotensive group (Mantel-Haenszel pooled estimate of odds ratio 2.63; 95% confidence interval 2.23 to 3.10). CONCLUSION--An independent clinical association exists between the occurrence of urolithiasis and hypertension. The increased urinary calcium excretion commonly detected in hypertension may be the pathogenetic link.\r"

DESIGN--A two year prospective case-controlled study based in a geographically defined area. SETTING--Four health districts in Avon and north Somerset. SUBJECTS--Babies who had died suddenly and unexpectedly aged between 1 week and 2 years (index babies) and two control babies for each index baby selected from the same health visitor's list and matched for age, time of year of the interview, and area of residence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Major and minor signs of illness during two weeks before the index babies' death, or before the interview for control babies, and consultations with the general practitioner during the same period. RESULTS--Parents reported major and minor signs of illness in the previous week in 66 of the 95 index babies compared with 77 of the 190 controls. No significant difference was found in the incidence of major signs reported (34 out of 95 index babies and 44 out of 190 controls), but a higher proportion of the index babies had been seen by their general practitioner during the previous week (17/95 v 11/190). CONCLUSION--Major and minor signs of illness are neither a sensitive nor a specific indicator of sudden unexpected death of infants and have no predictive value. Better understanding of the reasons why a higher proportion of parents of babies who died took them to their general practitioners may help to identify babies at risk before death.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To audit all mid-trimester amniocenteses performed by obstetricians at a district general hospital to see whether experience improved the outcome. DESIGN--Retrospective review of medical records. SETTING--Royal Gwent Hospital, south Wales. SUBJECTS--All 469 amniocenteses carried out in 1985-7. OUTCOME MEASURES--Number of attempts at withdrawal of amniotic fluid; number with bloodstained liquor; and number of subsequent miscarriages, terminations, and congenital abnormalities. RESULTS--Of the 469 amniocenteses, 411 were performed by one obstetrician, and initial comparisons with those performed by the rest of the hospital team showed no significant differences in outcome of pregnancy. The main difference between the two groups was in the number of attempts at withdrawal of amniotic fluid and the number with bloodstained liquor. The single obstetrician failed to obtain amniotic fluid on 1% of occasions compared with 10% for the other operators by the end of the second attempt. The costs of carrying out the audit were considerable. The review of fewer than 500 case records cost the equivalent of 2000 pounds in staff time and took over 200 hours to complete, equivalent to 63 sessions of one person's time. CONCLUSIONS--The audit was useful in that it provided information on complication rates, which could be compared with published data, and comparisons between obstetricians who perform large and small numbers of procedures. IMPLICATIONS--For an individual's practice the monitoring of amniocentesis should not be continuously carried out and subsequent audits should tackle other common procedures. When an audit is attempted the health service should provide adequate support to clinicians for this purpose.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised controlled study. PATIENTS--539 Subjects aged 75 and over from two general practices. INTERVENTION--All subjects were visited at the beginning and end of the study by volunteers, who completed a scored activity of daily living questionnaire. The study group were revisited at regular intervals. Individuals with an increase in score greater than 5 were referred to their general practitioners. All interactions with social services and health authorities were recorded for both groups. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Mortality, activity of daily living score, total number of days in institutions, geriatric and psychogeriatric service contacts, primary health care team contacts, use of community support services. RESULTS--The study group were admitted to hospital more often than the controls (335 occasions v 252), but the control group spent 33% more days in institutions, mainly in long term admissions to residential accommodation. The number of falls reported in the control group doubled (from 17 before the first interview to 36 before the last) and in the study group remained unchanged (12 before both interviews). The study group received community support services sooner than the control group. There was no difference between the groups in mortality or activity of daily living score. CONCLUSION--Regular visiting of old people at home by non-professional volunteers using a simple activity of daily living questionnaire is a practical way of identifying problems and initiating action for this group.\r"

The latter group has been reviewed, taking into account invasiveness, results, complications and cost effectiveness. A combination of PCNL and ESWL was beneficial in patients in whom percutaneous access through a single tract removed more than 70% of the stone. As a result of these findings, the authors propose a revised classification of staghorn calculi.\r"

The maximum bladder capacity was approximately 770 ml with an absolute intravesical pressure of 23 to 30 cm H2O. Intravesical pressure waves with a mean amplitude of 20 cm H2O were found in 38% of patients in group 1 and 25% in group 2; 61% of these patients were asymptomatic. The results showed that 85% of patients were continent by day and by night. We attribute this to our operative technique: the ileal loop is folded 4 times in a \"W\" or \"M\" shape to achieve complete detubularisation of the bowel and the external urethral sphincter is carefully preserved. Altogether, these data show the ileal neobladder technique to be a reliable and safe method of bladder substitution.\r"

The diagnosis was invasive bladder cancer in 10 patients and severe intractable interstitial cystitis in 1. The surgical technique in the male patients was modified to simplify the procedure. The 2 female patients underwent insertion of an artificial sphincter around the bowel segment for a continence mechanism. One patient died 6 weeks post-operatively from a severe coagulopathy. Five of the 9 male patients are continent day and night, relying on their own residual sphincter mechanism, but the remaining 4 required insertion of the artificial urinary sphincter to achieve social continence. The surviving female patient is totally continent. All patients have voiding intervals of 4 to 6 h during the day and are thus continent both day and night, but in some cases the artificial sphincter was necessary to achieve this. Loss of the normal bladder-sphincter reflexes following cystectomy may account for the high incidence of nocturnal incontinence observed in most series. Total bladder replacement is now possible in both male and female patients, thus avoiding an abdominal stoma.\r"

However, at alkaline pH (mean = 8.1) there was a biphasic degradation of doxorubicin (mean t1/2 = 3.24 and 89 h respectively). The data indicate that buffering intravesical doxorubicin to pH 4.6 (acetate buffer) or pre-dosing of patients with ammonium chloride may minimise loss of active drug during the time for which the drug is retained in the bladder. Recovery of doxorubicin following 1 hour's retention in the bladder was similar (77%) for doses of 38/48 or 78 mg. It is suggested that a dose of 50 mg (1 mg/ml) is sufficient to ensure an adequate delivery of active drug to the bladder wall.\r"

  ".U": "90283632\r", 
  ".W": "The Liverpool male and female nomograms provide normal reference ranges for the maximum and average urine flow rates over a wide range of voided volumes. A known urine flow rate, in combination with the respective voided volume (and in men the age), can be converted into an equivalent centile ranking, using the equation for the relevant nomogram. Centile rankings allow the urine flow rates of specific male and female populations to be compared. The maximum and average urine flow rates of urodynamic patients (504 consecutive male and 168 consecutive female) were converted into centile rankings. These centile rankings were then compared with the respective urodynamic diagnoses. The median centile rankings for their maximum and average urine flow rates were 21 and 11 (male) respectively and 31 and 18 (female) (vs 50 for the normal populations). The low urine flow rates applied to all diagnostic groups, including those symptomatic men and women who were found to be urodynamically normal. Low urine flow rates may be one of a number of subtle manifestations of urological disease in these patients. Men with obstruction and women with voiding difficulties had the lowest urine flow rates. The 25th centile (men) and the 10th centile (women) appeared to be most appropriate lower limits of normality for both urine flow rates to identify those men more likely to be obstructed and those women at higher risk of voiding difficulties. Men and women with detrusor instability had the highest urine flow rates. Detrusor instability was present in 71% of men with centile rankings for the maximum urine flow rate over 50; 50% of women whose maximum urine flow rate centiles were over 90 had detrusor instability.\r"

Only 5 were non-walkers--all neuropathic. Most patients were operated on for incontinence but 12 had upper tract damage related either to urinary diversion or to poor bladder compliance in the early phase of filling; 69 patients became dry, voiding spontaneously (30), by activation of an artificial urinary sphincter (17) or by self intermittent catheterisation (22). Four patients still have nocturnal enuresis, 3 diurnal enuresis and 2 have stress incontinence. One patient has had a continent diversion. The \"clam\" procedure has revolutionised bladder reconstruction. Careful review has failed to predict the small number who do not achieve a perfect result.\r"

It was concluded that with high upper tract flow rates, vesical filling can affect upper tract dynamics and this should be considered when evaluating patients with loin pain or potential obstructive uropathy.\r"

In contrast, the highest sensitivity in newly detected carcinomas (n = 41) was obtained with PSA (71%), whereas that of GSM (51%) was comparable to that of PAP (44%). Of 41 patients with newly detected prostatic cancer, 35 (85%) showed a significant increase in at least 1 of the tumour markers. Five of 6 patients whose markers were within normal limits had incidental carcinomas. During follow-up, PSA was raised in 88%, GSM in 66% and PAP in 55% within 12 months prior to clinical progression. Our results suggest that the determination of GSM may be of value in the serological detection and monitoring of prostatic cancer. These findings must be confirmed by further studies with larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up.\r"

Contralateral histological abnormalities were found in 12 specimens. The duration of torsion correlated well with the viability of the involved testis but not with the presence of contralateral abnormalities. The high incidence of contralateral histological abnormalities and their nature suggest that they existed prior to the torsion since they would be unlikely to appear at such an early stage. We believe that some patients who suffer testicular torsion probably have congenital anomalies of both testes. These abnormalities involve testicular parenchyma as well as the suspension system.\r"

Patients with a rectal focus of infection had a greater number of bacteria and required longer hospitalisation and more operative procedures than patients with dermal or urethral foci. Those over the age of 60 had significantly longer hospital stays and higher mortality. Diabetes and impaired renal function did not increase mortality or morbidity. Suprapubic cystostomy was required in 24 patients (83%), diverting colostomy in 9 (31%) and orchiectomy in 3 (10%).

The technique is simple, has few complications and is recommended in the treatment of patients with failed hypospadias repair and urethral fistulas.\r"

The dense fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa which destroys the normal vascular erectile system of the penis also complicates insertion of penile prostheses. Our experience in 5 patients is reviewed. Sharp dissection and dilatation were necessary to form a tunnel for the prosthesis, which was more easily excavated anteriorly and posteriorly through a dorsal incision than for the length of the corpora through a traditional perineal-scrotal incision. Damage to the tunica was common and subsequent migration of the prosthesis necessitated an additional 11 procedures under general anaesthesia. Despite these technical difficulties, the procedure allowed satisfactory intercourse. The average interval between onset of impotence and implantation was 4 years. Early implantation before the dense fibrosis develops might give more satisfactory results.\r"

There was a correlation between dysplasia and the presence of carcinoma and the duration of the disease in the operative specimen of colon and rectum and also in the anorectal mucosal specimen although the number of patients with carcinoma (eight cases) in this analysis was small. All 14 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis showed large bowel mucosal dysplasia in the operative specimen which was severe in six cases.

In the five patients not improved after surgery only a few unstable motor unit potentials could be recorded in the external anal sphincter muscle. In two of these patients the pudendal nerve terminal motor latency could not be recorded after surgery.

A test was completed by 1025 patients before double-contrast barium enema and the performance of each test was determined from the result of this investigation. The study was completed by 969 patients. There were 49 patients with colorectal cancer, 92 patients with a cancer or a polyp greater than 5 mm, and 130 with some mucosal abnormality. The test most sensitive for blood, Fecatwin, detected 14 of 15 (93 per cent) cancers and 29 (69 per cent) of 42 patients with mucosal disease (including inflammatory bowel disease) but gave three times as many false positive results as the Haemoccult test, which is less sensitive for blood. The chance of a patient with a positive Haemoccult result having mucosal disease on barium enema was 24 of 47 patients (51 per cent) (two-thirds of these having colorectal cancer). A negative Haemoccult result, however, was unreliable and should not influence patient management. A test less sensitive for blood than Haemoccult was found to be of little value in symptomatic patients.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1983, 14 patients with intrahepatic and common bile duct stones have undergone percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy because the stones were too large to be removed using ordinary percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopy. Stones were completely fragmented in seven cases (six with intrahepatic stones and one with common bile duct stone) and partially disrupted in five cases with intrahepatic stones. Intrahepatic duct angulation and stricture was the factor most often responsible for failure. All the disintegrated stones were removed by subsequent transhepatic cholangioscopy. Amongst the seven patients with complete stone fragmentation, six stones were found with electrohydraulic shock-wave lithotripsy and one with NdYAG laser lithotripsy. Complications of percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy using electrohydraulic shock waves were found in three cases, two had transient haemobilia and one had fever and chills after the procedures. They all recovered by conservative treatment. NdYAG laser treatment was expensive, time consuming and inconvenient to use. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy by using electrohydraulic shock wave is an effective and safe method to fragment biliary stones and to facilitate their removal.\r"

The largest mean(s.d.) diameter of the common duct, after correcting for magnification, was 0.96(0.27) cm before cholecystectomy and 1.16(0.29) cm after surgery (P less than 0.0001). Thirty-one of the 35 patients showed increased duct size after cholecystectomy, and the difference was 1 mm or more in 26 patients. There was a positive correlation between the increase in bile duct size and the time interval after cholecystectomy. After cholecystectomy a small but significant increase in bile duct diameter is demonstrable on ERCP.\r"

Enlargement of the gallbladder with accumulation of biliary sludge and hypomotility were frequently observed within a month of operation for gastric cancer, suggesting that biliary stasis is an important contributing factor in postoperative acute cholecystitis. Within 3 months of operation, contraction had recovered to close to preoperative levels and the incidence of biliary sludge formation gradually decreased. Daily administration of an opiate antagonist, naloxone (0.8 mg), significantly improved gallbladder dyskinesia and decreased the incidence of biliary sludge formation within 1 month of gastrectomy.\r"

To determine whether there was an advantage in draining the stump of the pancreas into a Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum, a retrospective survey of 113 patients who had a distal pancreatectomy for chronic pancreatitis or complications of acute pancreatitis in the non-acute phase was undertaken. The decision to perform a drainage procedure was determined on the basis of the pancreatogram, the size of the pancreatic duct and technical factors at the time of the operation. Sixty-seven patients had no drainage procedure and 46 patients had a drainage procedure. The two groups were comparable in all respects before surgery. The postoperative outcome in the short- and long-term was similar in both groups. It is concluded that caudal pancreatic drainage confers no benefit following distal pancreatic resection.\r"

Median follow-up was 52 months, and included endoscopy, manometry and prolonged pH recordings in all cases in addition to clinical assessment. Using objective criteria, 12 patients (9.6 per cent) developed recurrent reflux. In nine of these patients, endoscopy had suggested that the Nissen fundoplication had disrupted; wrap disruption was confirmed in seven patients who underwent reoperation. The median time to endoscopic recognition of wrap disruption was 7 months (range 3-10 months). In contrast, of 115 patients with endoscopic evidence of an intact fundoplication, only 3 (2.6 per cent) had recurrent reflux. Endoscopy allowed reliable differentiation between those with and without reflux control after operation (P less than 0.001). These results suggest that recurrent reflux after Nissen fundoplication is due to wrap disruption. This phenomenon occurs within the first postoperative year and can be recognized by informed endoscopic assessment.\r"

Seven patients with an unsatisfactory outcome because of frequent vomiting had gastric stasis and two had delay in emptying of the jejunal component of the Roux-en-Y. Vomiting was more likely in patients with a dependent sump (P less than 0.006) and emptying was significantly prolonged where a sump was present (P = 0.0009).

The cribriform subtype showed a significantly lower rate of DNA aneuploidy and a lower proliferative index than the other subtypes. Cribriform tumours were almost exclusively well differentiated in contrast with the comedo and solid variants. Our results suggest the cribriform variant is less aggressive than other subtypes of DCIS. This has possible implications for management of these lesions.\r"

The study consisted of two parts, a pilot study in which mathematical models for appropriate support pressures were produced and the main study to assess the role of an inflatable lumbar support. The use of a support reduced the incidence of back pain on the first postoperative day from 46 to 21 per cent (P = 0.007). The patient's sex, height, weight, and the presence or absence of obesity were not found to be significant factors in the incidence of postoperative back pain. Previous back pain or arthritis in any joint tended to be associated with an increase in the severity and incidence of postoperative back pain. Postoperative back pain was more severe after procedures lasting more than 40 min. Early mobilization reduced the amount of back pain. In conclusion, patients benefit from the use of an inflatable lumbar support if they have previously suffered from backache or if they are to be anaesthetized for more than 40 min.\r"

Subjective feelings of fatigue and fatigue measured objectively in the adductor pollicis muscle after ulnar nerve stimulation have been studied in relation to changes in cardiorespiratory function and muscular efficiency both at rest and when walking on a treadmill at a work rate of 20 and 56 kpm min-1. Twelve patients admitted for elective abdominal surgery were studied before operation and again on the third postoperative day. The postoperative period was characterized by an increased feeling of fatigue. Surgery had no effect upon fatigue in the adductor pollicis muscle suggesting that the genesis of postoperative fatigue is partly central in origin. Muscular efficiency (s.d.) fell from 34(6) per cent before operation to 22(3) per cent (P less than 0.05) on the third postoperative day and was accompanied by a 19 per cent rise in the net energy (s.d.) expenditure (7.3(0.8) to 8.6(0.3) kJ min-1; P less than 0.03) required to perform a given workload. The increased cardiorespiratory effort and reduced muscular efficiency associated with the performance of low-intensity exercise may limit mobilization after surgery and contribute to a greater feeling of fatigue.\r"

To determine if proliferative oxygen-induced retinopathy can be produced in the rat, 40 newborn rat pups were exposed from birth either to air for 25 days or to an 80% oxygen environment for 10 days, followed by 15 days in air. Extraretinal neovascularization was observed in 80% (16/20) of the rat pups exposed to hyperoxia (p less than 0.001) with a bilaterality of 87.5% (14/16). Mild to moderate vitreous hemorrhage was seen in only three eyes. Mesenchymal shunt or ridge formation was not demonstrated, nor was retinal detachment.\r"

The glaucomatous eyes were free from visual field defects within the central 5 degrees. They underwent the Macula Threshold Test of the Humphrey perimeter, using white and blue targets. Differential sensitivities to both white and blue were significantly depressed in the glaucoma group (p less than 0.001). Blue thresholds of glaucomatous subjects and normal subjects were distributed in two quite separate domains, with a mean difference of 4.51 dB. Sensitivities to blue stimuli were related to age in the normal group (r = 0.62; p less than 0.001), while in the glaucoma group they were related to horizontal cup/disc ratios (r = 0.63; p less than 0.001). These results suggest that threshold testing with an automated perimeter and its built-in colour filters can be of help in detecting early central functional disturbances from glaucoma.\r"

Ten to 14 days later, the whole breast was treated to 4500 cGy at 180 per fraction in 5 weeks. The 6-year actuarial survival for stages I and II disease was 98% and 91%, respectively, and the recurrence-free survival was 96% and 98%, respectively. When these 323 patients were evaluated by T status, a local control of 97% was the same for T1 and T2 lesions. The cosmetic results were good to excellent in 95% of the patients. This approach has improved our ability to accurately place the boost dose in the breast.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred eight cases of intraductal breast carcinoma (DCIS) were selectively treated; 97 with mastectomy, 96 with radiation therapy, and 15 using excisional biopsy only. Mastectomy patients tended to have larger tumors, involved biopsy margins, palpable and often multifocal tumors. Breast preservation patients tended to have smaller, often occult, tumors with clear surgical margins. Before 1983, mastectomy was more common; during and after 1983, breast preservation was more common. Comedocarcinomas were the most frequent tumors. They were the largest, had the highest percentage of microinvasion (20%), and had the highest recurrence rate (8%). Noncomedo DCIS had a recurrence rate of 1%, one of 103 tumors. The recurrence rate for comedocarcinomas treated with radiation therapy was nearly three times higher than for those treated with mastectomy (11% versus 4%). One of 164 (0.6%) axillary lymph node dissections yielded positive nodes. Nine patients have recurred: two in the mastectomy group and seven in the breast conservation group (P less than 0.1). Eight of nine recurrences were the comedo subtype (P less than 0.05). Three patients developed metastatic disease, two of whom have died. Axillary dissection for intraductal carcinoma of the breast is unlikely to yield involved nodes and is not indicated for most cases. It should be reserved for lesions revealing microinvasion. Conservative therapy for comedocarcinoma must be viewed with caution.\r"

The 501 patients underwent 516 radical neck dissections. Patients were grouped by clinical neck status at the time of neck dissection: elective dissection (ED) in the N0 neck, immediate therapeutic dissection (ITD) in the N+ neck, and subsequent therapeutic dissection (STD) in the neck observed which converted clinically to N+. Pathologically identified NM occurred 34% of the time in ED, 69% in ITD and 90% in STD. The sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the clinical exam was 70%, 65%, and 68%, respectively. Detailed analysis was performed for each group based on the primary site. This revealed a prevalence of NM in level IV of 3% (five of 167) for ED versus 17% (49/296) for ITD + STD (P less than 0.001). Tongue, retromolar trigone, and cheek did not have NM in level V in any group. The prevalence of NM in level V for floor of mouth or gum primaries was less than 1% (one of 109) in ED versus 6% (ten of 167) in ITD + STD (P less than 0.03). These data support the trend toward selective limited neck dissection in both N0 and N+ patients. Further, they provide the foundation for planning of future prospective trials to assess the efficacy of modifications in the extent of neck dissection.\r"

The recorded take rate in the first passage was 24%. Median survival in the take group was 25 months versus 74 months in the nontake group, which is not statistically significant in this material. However, the numerical difference in survival between the take groups is in accordance with the concept that human tumors accepted as xenografts on nude mice may constitute a selected group of malignancies. This has to be considered when using heterotransplanted human tumors for in vivo investigations of SCC of the head and neck.\r"

Field sizes, defined at the 90% isodose surface, varied from 5 mm to 25 mm and were chosen in order to deliver 20 to 25 Gy at the periphery of the malformation. To date, 14 angiographic studies were repeated at 1 year posttreatment. In six patients (43%) a complete obliteration of the lesion was achieved. Late side effects were observed in three patients. Our initial analysis, at 1 year posttreatment, suggests that our results are comparable with those previously reported for other radiosurgical techniques. The linac-based dynamic stereotactic technique appears to be a valid alternative to radiosurgery with the Gamma unit or with heavy-charged particle beams.\r"

One third of the tumors had cytoplasmic and membrane positivity with the protein-specific antibody but in none were there positive tumor cells with the carbohydrate-specific antibody which recognizes the blood group A antigen. There was no difference in EGF-R expression between typical and aggressive meningiomas. No evidence was found to support previous reports of specific EGF-R immunoreactivity in the vascular endothelial cells of meningiomas. The authors believe this discrepancy to be due to detection of normal blood group A antigen attached to endothelial cells in patients of blood group A or AB. This occurs because many monoclonal anti-EGF-R antibodies are specific for A antigen which is found on the EGF-R of A431 cells but has not been reported on EGF-R elsewhere.\r"

All of these enzymes are involved in pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis. The metabolism of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was determined. The levels of these enzymes, except for OPRT, were high in tumor tissues and almost the same between lung squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas, with no statistical difference. The activities for phosphorylation and degradation of 5-FU were similar in each tissue type of tumor. As 5-FU is incorporated into tumor cells and is metabolized actively to 5-FU nucleotides in squamous cell carcinoma tissues, at almost the same level seen in adenocarcinoma tissues, this drug should have a wide clinical application.\r"

  ".W": "The signification of serum bone Gla protein (serum BGP, osteocalcin) has been investigated in multiple myeloma. As a first step, quantitative iliac crest bone biopsies were performed in 19 patients; the serum BGP levels strongly correlated with histologic parameters of bone formation (r = 0.72-0.84, P less than 0.001) but not with those of bone resorption (r = 0.10). These results confirm that serum BGP is a marker of bone formation in multiple myeloma, as previously described in many other bone disorders. As a second step, serum BGP was measured in 117 patients with multiple myeloma as a systemic indicator of the degree of bone formation. Twenty-one percent of the patients had abnormal serum BGP levels (25 cases). The 14 patients with increased values (mean, 13.2 +/- 2.7 ng/ml) and thus increased bone formation belonged to a subgroup characterized by a lower osteolytic potential and a more indolent disease. On the other hand, the 11 patients with decreased values (mean, 1 +/- 0.3 ng/ml) and thus reduced bone formation had an advanced disease, extensive lytic bone lesions, a hypercalcemia frequently and a poor survival (mean, 4 months; range, 1-12). The biochemical investigations of the whole patient population, including serial studies in individual patients, have shown a large scatter of serum BGP levels, suggesting major differences in the bone formation rates. However, an overall inverse correlation was found between serum BGP and osteolytic potential. These results have confirmed the important role of the inhibition of bone formation in the occurrence of bone lesions in multiple myeloma and the interest of serum BGP to select a myeloma patient subgroup with low osteolytic potential and characterized by abnormally increased levels of this marker.\r"

The ultrastructure of the tumor appeared to be distinctive, characterized by the absence of neuronal elements, and the presence of large amounts of redundant and sometimes extensively duplicated basal laminal material and collagen between nonpleomorphic and nonlipidized astrocytes, corresponding to the reticulin fibers seen by light microscopic analysis between the S-100 protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cells. The features of the tumor, its differential diagnosis, and its relationship to other pediatric supratentorial tumors are discussed.\r"

Primary brain tumors rarely metastasize outside of the central nervous system (CNS) without prior neurosurgery. Extracranial spread at diagnosis has been previously documented in just two adults. Extracranial metastasis of a childhood glioma without prior neurosurgery at any time during the course of the disease is exceedingly rare. Spread to bone by gliomas is also infrequent, and when they occur, bony metastases are usually isolated to one or two sites in any given patient. The widespread osseous metastases in our patient have been reported in three prior cases of high-grade gliomas. This child's GBM likely reflects a highly aggressive variant with the potential to spread outside the CNS and with a predilection for bone. Oncologists should be aware that GBM may present in this fashion during childhood.\r"

  ".W": "Small cell carcinomas of the major salivary glands are rare tumors, accounting for less than 1% of malignant neoplasms at these sites. To date, approximately 41 such tumors have been described. They recently have been classified into two groups, based on the ultrastructural presence or absence of intracytoplasmic neuroendocrine (NE) granules, \"small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma\" and \"small cell ductal carcinoma\". This study concerns 11 primary small cell carcinomas that had been previously studied ultrastructurally; it was undertaken to determine whether these lesions possessed a neuroendocrine phenotype, using a battery of immunohistochemical stains. Antibodies to epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CK), Leu 7, vimentin (VIM), synaptophysin (SYN), chromogranin (CHR), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) were employed, with the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex technique and paraffin sections. All tumors in this study expressed at least one neuroendocrine marker. In eight tumors EMA was found; CK was present in all 11 cases, seven of which demonstrated focal paranuclear staining. Leu 7 was seen in eight tumors, VIM was expressed in two cases, SYN was found in three tumors, and CHR was detected in three neoplasms. Anti-neuron-specific enolase labeled eight tumors. From the preceding data one may conclude that all small cell salivary gland carcinomas have neuroendocrine characteristics, even though dense core granules cannot be demonstrated in some of them ultrastructurally.\r"

Patient ages ranged from birth to 5 years with a mean age of 12.5 months. Three treatment groups were identified. In Group A, episcleral plaque was the only irradiation modality. In this group, 24 patients and 25 eyes with tumors of Reese-Ellsworth Stages I to III, and selected Stage VB tumors were irradiated using eye plaques. Twenty-two of 25 (88%) eyes are without evidence of disease (NED), and all patients are alive. Two eyes were enucleated for recurrent RB. Two of 23 eyes developed minimal cataracts. In Group B, external-beam was the only irradiation modality. Twelve patients with 21 involved eyes comprise this group. Thirteen eyes received EBRT alone. Seventy-seven percent of 13 eyes have NED. Four eyes developed cataracts. Three of 13 eyes required enucleation for progression of disease; one of these was Stage IVA and two of them were Stage VA. For Group C, external-beam plus episcleral plaque was used. Twenty-seven patients and 51 eyes with advanced retinoblastoma were included in this group. Episcleral plaque was used in 29 eyes as a salvage procedure for recurrent RB, or in selected cases was used as a boost after initial external beam irradiation. Fifteen of 29 eyes (52%) remain with NED with useful vision, and nine developed cataracts. Enucleation was performed in 14 eyes for recurrent RB. The authors conclude that radiation therapy has a major role in the management of RB due to its ability to control even advanced disease, allowing preservation of vision in a significant number of patients.\r"

All patients were treated for their recurrence by the combination of reexcision of as much of the tumor mass as was technically feasible and intraoperative radiogold (198Au) seed implantation of the residual tumor and/or tumor bed. The mean dose to the tumor volume from the implant was 4000 cGy. For the 13 patients treated for recurrent glioblastoma the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were 46%, 15%, and 8%, respectively. For the 20 patients treated for recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates were 75%, 50%, and 15%, respectively. Survival was measured from the time of implant. The median survival for patients with glioblastoma was 9 months. The median survival for patients with anaplastic astrocytoma was 17 months. One patient died in the immediate postoperative period from a gastrointestinal bleed. No patient required reoperation for radiation necrosis. The authors believe that this technique is an effective treatment for patients with high-grade gliomas recurring after external-beam radiation therapy, and are now including interstitial irradiation in the initial management of selected patients with high-grade gliomas.\r"

  ".W": "During a 21-year period, 66 patients with uterine sarcomas were treated at California Medical Center. Histological diagnoses were mixed mesodermal sarcoma in 32 patients (48%), leiomyosarcoma in 24 (36%), and endometrial stromal sarcoma in 10 (15%) patients. The majority of patients (73%) had Stage I tumors. The treatment consisted of surgery alone in 27 (41%), surgery in combination with radiation therapy in 36 (55%), and radiation therapy alone in three (4%) patients. The overall 1-, 2-, and 5-year actuarial survival was 74%, 57%, and 38%, respectively. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year actuarial survival for the 27 surgery alone patients was 73%, 50%, and 25%, which compared with 75%, 61%, and 44% for the 36 surgery plus radiation therapy patients (P = 0.12). The disease-free survival was better for the surgery plus radiation therapy patients, as compared with the surgery alone group (38% vs. 18% at 5 years, P = 0.081). The 5-year survival by histology was 70% for the 10 endometrial stromal sarcoma patients, 40% for the 24 leiomyosarcoma patients, and 23% for the 32 mesodermal sarcoma patients (P = 0.064). As expected, survival depended on the stage of disease (P less than 0.0001). Treatment failure was observed in 35 (53%) patients, which included 9 (14%) with failure in the pelvis. There was no difference in the incidence of failure among patients in the three treatment groups and also in the three histologic groups. There was, however, a significant difference in the incidence of pelvic failure between surgery alone and surgery plus radiation therapy patients. In the 27 surgery alone patients, nine (33%) relapsed in the pelvis, whereas none of the 36 surgery plus radiation therapy patients had locoregional failure, P less than 0.0001. Adjuvant radiation therapy is an important treatment in the management of patients with sarcoma of the uterus.\r"

According to the Robson classification 12 patients were found at surgery to have Stage I renal carcinoma, three patients had Stage II, ten had Stage IIIA, one had Stage IIIB, two had Stage IIIC, one had Stage IVA, and two had Stage IVB disease. Twenty-five (81%) of 31 patients were staged correctly by MRI. Clearly MRI showed venous tumor extension without the need for intravenous contrast administration. Also, MRI had a negative predictive value of 95%, and a positive predictive value of 100% for the evaluation of inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. At 1.5 Tesla MRI is an excellent staging modality in the preoperative evaluation of renal carcinoma. It is especially recommended in patients with equivocal computed tomography findings and in all patients with contraindications to the intravenous use of iodinated contrast material.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty-six patients underwent curative resection of a primary pancreatic carcinoma from January 1977 to September 1987; 26 had Whipple resections, seven had total pancreatectomies, and three had distal pancreatectomies. Twenty-six patients manifested recurrent disease, four died of intercurrent disease, and six were apparently cured. Median survival was 11.5 months with actuarial survival at 2 and 5 years of 32% and 17%, respectively. Of the eventual recurrences, 19% were local only (pancreatic bed, regional nodes, adjacent organs, and immediately adjacent peritoneum) and 73% had a component of local failure. All patients failing did so with a component in the intraabdominal cavity. Peritoneal (42%) and hepatic failures (62%) were common. Extraabdominal metastases were documented in only 27%, but never as a sole site. Fourteen patient and tumor characteristics were evaluated for any relationships with failure or survival. No single variable independently predicted for local failure. However, a group of three (age greater than 60 years, T2 or T3 stage, and location of tumor in the body or tail) was associated with a substantial local failure risk (85% of all patients with local failure). Multivariate analysis showed that low tumor grade (P = 0.002), female sex (P = 0.002), and adjuvant radiation (P = 0.02) were all independent predictors of prolonged survival. Ten patients were treated in an adjacent setting. Those given 55 Gy or greater had improved local control (50% versus 25%) and cure (33% versus none) when compared with patients treated to lower doses. The authors conclude that local failure after curative resection remains a significant problem and further efforts to improve local control are warranted. However, peritoneal and hepatic relapses occur frequently. Thus, adjuvant treatment strategies using wide-field radiation techniques or intraperitoneal therapy, in combination with local tumor bed irradiation and chemotherapy, should be explored.\r"

The patients received a tumor dose of 5000 to 5500 cGy in 180 cGy fractions, five fractions per week, over 5.5 to 6 weeks. Overall actuarial survival at 2, 5, and 10 years was 71%, 55%, and 43%, respectively. Progression-free survival at 2, 5, and 10 years was 69%, 50%, and 39%, respectively. Survival for patients receiving postoperative radiation therapy in the range of 4500 to 5900 cGy was 78% and 66% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Quality of life was determined at two points in time: 1 to 2 years postoperatively, and at last follow-up (2-12 years postoperatively). The occurrence of mental retardation was specifically addressed in long-term survivors, and was observed in 50% of children. Overall, however, 80% of short-term survivors and 67% of long-term survivors were intellectually and physically intact, without major neurologic deficit. Specific prognostic factors were assessed by multivariate analysis. Improved survival was observed with young patients, females, normal preoperative mental status, surgical resection (versus biopsy alone), involvement of only one lobe with tumor, and a history of preoperative seizures. A weighted prognostic factor score derived from these observations permits a clinically useful assessment of risk for individual patients.\r"

This study evaluated the effects of a glutamine-enriched elemental diet, administered before whole-abdominal radiation on gut glutamine metabolism, mucosal morphometrics, and bacterial translocation. Rats were randomized to receive a nutritionally complete elemental diet that was glutamine-enriched or glutamine-free for 4 days. The animals were then subjected to a single dose of 1000 cGy x-radiation to the abdomen. After irradiation, all animals received the glutamine-free diet. Four days later the animals underwent laparotomy for sampling of arterial and portal venous blood, culture of mesenteric lymph nodes, and removal of the small intestine for microscopic examination. There was no difference in arterial glutamine or gut glutamine extraction between the two groups, but body weight loss was significantly diminished in the glutamine-fed rats. Rats receiving the glutamine-enriched elemental diet before radiation had a significant increase in jejunal villous number, villous height, and number of metaphase mitoses per crypt. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the presence of an intact gut epithelium in eight of eight rats receiving prophylactic glutamine compared to one of eight animals in the glutamine-free group. Three of eight rats fed glutamine had culture positive mesenteric lymph nodes compared with five of seven rats receiving the glutamine-free diet. Glutamine exerts a protective effect on the small bowel mucosa by supporting crypt cell proliferation effect on accelerate healing of the acutely radiated bowel.\r"

The majority of these patients were selected to receive radiation therapy because they had the more favorable characteristics of minimal extralymphatic involvement, mediastinal masses that were superior and central in location, and a MMR less than or equal to 0.50. All 20 patients were laparotomy staged, and 17 received some radiation to the mantle before laparotomy. Seventeen patients had pathologic stage (PS) II disease (13 PS IIA, 4 PS IIB), two had PS IIISA, and one had PS IB. Eleven patients (55%) had extralymphatic involvement. All patients were irradiated to the mantle field using a shrinking field technique (mediastinal dose, 4400 to 5500 cGy, mean 4990 cGy). After completion of the mantle, all patients with good clinical responses received infradiaphragmatic radiation. Treatment complications included two cases of mild radiation pneumonitis, five of hypothyroidism, five of localized Herpes zoster, one of amenorrhea, one of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and one of sepsis. Four patients relapsed. All had an intrathoracic component to their failure. All four patients were salvaged with MOP(P) chemotherapy and are currently alive and free of disease. For the entire group, the actuarial freedom from relapse is 80% at 7 years and the survival is 100%. Median follow-up time is 67 months. The authors conclude that radiation therapy alone is effective in the management of selected patients with Hodgkin's disease who have extensive mediastinal involvement, even when the MMR exceeds 1/3.\r"

The incidence, 10-year actuarial risk, and relative risk of developing an acute leukemia, solid tumor, or second lymphoma were determined by treatment modality and initial lymphoma type. Among the 313 Hodgkin's disease patients, the acute leukemia actuarial risk was 2.0% after chemotherapy, 1.4% after radiation therapy, and 0.9% after combined treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Their relative risk for acute leukemia was 51.3 overall (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.8 to 131.8) and was elevated in each treatment group. Among the 686 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients, the acute leukemia actuarial risk was zero after radiation therapy, 4.6% after chemotherapy, and 4.5% after the combined treatment, again not significantly different between treatment groups. The leukemia relative risk was 10.6 (95% CI 3.4 to 24.8) in the chemotherapy and 11.9 (95% CI 3.2 to 30.6) in the combined treatment group. Among both the Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma populations, the combined treatment group had a lower actuarial risk for solid tumors than either the chemotherapy or radiation therapy group (P less than 0.02). Solid tumor actuarial risk did not differ significantly between the chemotherapy and radiation therapy groups. Hodgkin's disease patients had a solid tumor relative risk that was elevated significantly after radiation therapy (6.5; 95% CI 2.4 to 14.0) and to a lesser extent after chemotherapy (2.6; 95% CI 0.8 to 6.1) or combined treatment (1.7; 95% CI 0.2 to 6.0). Solid tumor relative risk among non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients was 0.3 for the combined treatment, 0.8 for the chemotherapy, and 1.0 for the radiation therapy group. None of the Hodgkin's disease patients developed a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study found no significant difference in leukemia risk among lymphoma patients treated with chemotherapy and the combined treatment. It also found that the overall risk of a second malignancy is no higher after treatment with the combined therapy than with chemotherapy or radiation therapy alone.\r"

The advantages of rapid exchange and the ability of utilize 2 Monorail balloon catheters through one 9F guiding catheter for simultaneous inflations allowed for maximal flexibility in treating patients with bifurcation lesions. The double wire approach utilizing one Monorail balloon catheter with a 7F guiding catheter was also technically successful. The Monorail Piccolino balloon catheter has unique features that allow for greater ease of operator use, rapid catheter exchange, and optimal angiographic visualization. It is felt that this catheter design provides distinct advantages over standard angioplasty equipment.\r"

However, the presence of a complex lesion morphology may bias the clinician away from angioplasty toward either recommending bypass surgery or continuing medical therapy alone in spite of recurrence of the symptoms which were sufficient indication for the initial angioplasty. One type of complex morphology at the site of the restenosis is due to the presence of a focal, eccentric aneurysmal dilatation similar in appearance to a saccular aneurysm. In two previously reported cases in the literature both were referred to bypass surgery. We report eight additional cases including the use of repeat successful angioplasty in six of the cases in spite of the potential problems posed by the complexity of the restenosed lesion. In addition, this case review suggests that this type of complex lesion morphology with restenosis may be more common when the initial angioplasty was associated with deep arterial injury, as in patients whose initial angioplasty was done in an infarct-related vessel or was associated with evidence of a large dissection.\r"

In 16 patients, we attempted coronary angioplasty in a retrograde direction through saphenous vein grafts to revascularize 17 isolated arterial segments. The retrograde dilatation was successful in 12 of 17 attempts (71%). Failure in 5 attempts was due to severe angulation between the graft insertion site and the retrograde proximal arterial limb. There were no major complications of these procedures. Symptoms and signs of myocardial ischemia were relieved following successful retrograde dilatation. Thus, retrograde dilatation through saphenous vein grafts provides another means of achieving complete revascularization using coronary angioplasty in patients with prior coronary bypass surgery.\r"

There were 23 boys and 21 girls aged 0.9-14.2 years at onset. FSGS was classified as \"hilar\" in biopsies containing at least one lesion contiguous with or involving the hilum, regardless of the location of other lesions, and as \"peripheral\" in the absence of hilar lesions. Of the 44 initial biopsies, 33 were designated hilar and 6 peripheral; the remaining 5 were unclassifiable as it was not possible to determine the location of 1-3 lesions in each biopsy. Twenty-eight of the 33 hilar biopsies also contained peripheral lesions, including paratubular (glomerular \"tip\") lesions in 15 instances. Paratubular lesions as the predominant abnormality were observed in only four biopsies. Repeat biopsies showed that transition occurred from one type to another, and only 4 biopsies remained with a final designation of peripheral FSGS. After a follow-up period of 1.6-24.9 years (mean 9.3), there was no significant difference in outcome between hilar and peripheral FSGS, whether diagnosed on the initial or repeat biopsy. The division into separate categories is not clearcut, and the use of this as a prognostic aid does not justify the additional cost of preparing and examining numerous serial sections.\r"

Thus, a significantly higher (t-test, p less than 0.01) excretion of both the total and LMW proteins was found in men than in women. However, the percentage of the LMW proteins among the total proteins did not differ between the sexes: 40.3 +/- 7.5% (range: 21.7-54.9%) for men and 36.5 +/- 9.9% (range: 20.1-56.7%) for women.\r"

Results were compared with those obtained in 6 hemodialyzed patients (No-EPO group) showing a comparable Hb concentration and Hct value as patients in the EPO group post-treatment and in 15 healthy subjects. EPO treatment was followed by a significant (ACTH and STH) or moderate (cortisol) suppression of basal plasma levels of ACTH, STH and cortisol respectively, and by a significant reduction of the response of plasma concentrations of these hormones to insulin-induced hypoglycemia. As the response of plasma levels of ACTH, STH and cortisol respectively in patients of the EPO group post-treatment differed markedly from that of the No-EPO group with similar Hb and Hct values, it seems that the EPO-induced endocrine alterations are not, at least not exclusively, a consequence of the improvement of anemia. Results presented in this study suggest that EPO treatment influences directly or indirectly the function of endocrine organs.\r"

The present study was undertaken to understand this relationship, by examining subjective and objective measures of sleep on nights following hemodialysis compared to those without hemodialysis. Significant sleep apnea was noted in 6 of 11 patients. The percentage of apnea time comprised of obstructive apneas increased significantly on the nights following hemodialysis. No significant differences occurred between these nights in the subjective or EEG measures of sleep, or in the total number of disordered breathing events or level of arterial oxygen desaturation. The association between end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and sleep apnea syndrome remains highly significant, but seems not to be acutely altered by conventional hemodialysis treatment.\r"

The experimental group received exogenous epidermal growth factor infused directly into the renal arterial circulation. Serum creatinine concentration was measured daily for 1 week. Epidermal growth factor receptor binding was measured by autoradiography of whole kidney sections. Renal cell proliferation was measured by incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. 2. Serum creatinine concentration increased after acute tubular necrosis with a peak at 48 h and remained elevated above control levels after 7 days. Binding of radiolabelled epidermal growth factor occurred in all regions of the kidney 48 h after ischaemia. Treatment with exogenous epidermal growth factor attenuated the rise in serum creatinine by 4 days after acute tubular necrosis and after 7 days serum creatinine was lower than in animals that did not receive epidermal growth factor. Infusion of epidermal growth factor also increased renal DNA synthesis. 3. The increase in epidermal growth factor binding in the kidney after acute tubular necrosis and the attenuation of the increase in serum creatinine concentration by administration of exogenous epidermal growth factor, suggest a role for epidermal growth factor in recovery from ischaemic damage. The increase in DNA synthesis in response to epidermal growth factor indicates that its effect may be due, at least in part, to accelerated tubular cell proliferation.\r"

We have retrospectively analysed the scores of 35 patients with a chronic form of hyponatraemia related to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and studied prospectively six patients. 2. The patients with high fractional excretion of filtered urea (greater than 55%) presented lower blood urea and lower salt excretion than the patients with normal fractional excretion of filtered urea, despite similar levels of hyponatraemia and of osmotic and uric acid clearances. In six hyponatraemic patients, an increase in salt intake was accompanied by a decrease in fractional excretion of filtered urea. In the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, the fractional excretion of filtered urea was inversely correlated to the fractional excretion of filtered sodium (r = -0.66; P less than 0.001), whereas the fractional excretion of filtered uric acid was not dependent on sodium excretion. 3. Hypouraemia with high fractional excretion of filtered urea in patients with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone is related to low urinary sodium excretion and thus reflects low sodium intake.\r"

The high-intensity pulse resulted in constriction of the pupil when the stimulation was homolateral. The miosis was slow in onset (120 s latency) and long-lasting (80 s). No pupillary changes were detected after either ipsilateral low-intensity or contralateral high-intensity stimuli. 3. In 11 healthy subjects, the pupillary response to transcutaneous electrical stimulation was evaluated during iris parasympathetic blockade induced by homatropine eyedrops. The disappearance of the light reflex due to homatropine was considered an index of the parasympathetic blockade. Afterwards, a high-intensity pulse was transcutaneously delivered to the emergence of the infratrochlear nerve and the ipsilateral pupil size was measured. 4. A reduction in the pupillary size followed the electrical stimulation, still under the effect of homatropine which abolished the light reflex. The time course of this pupillary constriction was similar to that seen without the influence of homatropine. 5. The findings suggest that homolateral miosis, observed after unilateral high-intensity stimulation of the infratrochlear nerve, does not stem from cholinergic activation. It has been suggested that miosis induced by transcutaneous electrical stimulation may be due to an antidromic activation of the iris sensory fibres.\r"

The effects of intravenous and intra-arterial infusion of the peptides derived from prepro-vasoactive intestinal peptide, vasoactive intestinal peptide, peptide histidine methionine and peptide histidine valine, were examined in six healthy volunteers. 2. Vasoactive intestinal peptide given intravenously caused a significant increase in heart rate and a decrease in diastolic, but not systolic, blood pressure, whereas peptide histidine valine caused an increase in heart rate alone, despite higher achieved circulating peptide concentrations. Peptide histidine methionine did not affect heart rate or blood pressure. Forearm blood flow was increased by vasoactive intestinal peptide and peptide histidine valine when infused locally intra-arterially, although vasoactive intestinal peptide was more potent than peptide histidine valine. 3. Plasma concentrations of cardiodilatin (the N-terminal peptide derived from pro-atrial natriuretic peptide) were increased by intravenous infusion of vasoactive intestinal peptide, but were unaffected by peptide histidine methionine or peptide histidine valine. Circulating plasma concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline did not change during infusion of vasoactive intestinal peptide, peptide histidine methionine or peptide histidine valine. 4. Peptide histidine valine had a long half-life when compared with peptide histidine methionine and vasoactive intestinal peptide. 5. We conclude that peptide histidine valine is active in the human cardiovascular system and has a similar, though less potent, vasodilating action to vasoactive intestinal peptide. The higher circulating levels of peptide histidine valine found in man suggest that it may be important in modulating vascular tone.\r"

Using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance, it has previously been demonstrated that patients with congestive heart failure exhibit a greater than normal phosphocreatine (PCr) depletion in the working skeletal muscles of the arm. We have studied the importance of the work necessary to reach a similar PCr depletion ([PCr]/([PCr] + [Pi]) = 0.5) in calf muscle. Our results show significantly lower values for patients with congestive heart failure in both aerobic and ischaemic conditions (respectively: 0.009 +/- 0.007 vs 0.026 +/- 0.013 W/kg body weight, P less than 0.01; 0.29 +/- 0.16 vs 0.90 +/- 0.25 J/kg body weight, P less than 0.01). 2. This original model of skeletal muscle exercise facilitates a comparison of PCr recovery rate due to a similarity in the PCr depletion and intracellular pH in the two series at the start of recovery. However, the PCr recovery rate is similar after both normoxic and ischaemic exercise, i.e. respective percentages of PCr increase in the first 25 s recovery spectrum were: (a) aerobic exercise, congestive heart failure 133 +/- 18%, control series 138 +/- 18%; (b) ischaemic exercise, congestive heart failure 114 +/- 13%, control series 118 +/- 12%. The absence of a difference in PCr recovery rate and the greater PCr depletion by ischaemic work in patients with congestive heart failure suggest modifications that cannot be explained by a reduced blood flow to the muscle. 3. When comparing the two series, intracellular pH evolved similarly in normoxia and ischaemia during both work and recovery. Thus, no increase in anaerobic glycolytic activity appears when equivalent PCr depletion has occurred.\r"

The test finished when a cough was produced at each inhalation (cough threshold) or the maximum concentration was reached. 3. The inspiratory flow rate was limited with a fixed resistance and displayed on a screen so that the subjects could reach a constant inspiratory flow rate of 50, 100 and 150 l/min with a submaximal inspiratory effort. 4. The mean (SD) inspiratory flow rates achieved were 51.4 (5.3), 86.2 (16.6) and 134.4 (22.9) l/min. Baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 s and functional vital capacity were not different on the 3 study days. 5.

These compounds are detectable only by their characteristic fluorescence, and few data based on long-term studies are available. For this reason, we studied subcutaneous skin collagen fluorescence in 57 nondiabetic (10- to 110-wk-old) and 74 streptozocin-induced diabetic (10- to 22-wk-old) rats. An exponential increase (r = 0.969, P less than 0.001) of collagen-linked fluorescence (excitation at 370 nm, emission at 440 nm) was observed with aging; after a lag, diabetes induced an earlier dramatic elevation of the fluorescence, suggesting a more complicated phenomenon than simple accumulation. To prevent such increases, the effects of 1 g.kg-1.day-1 aminoguanidine, suggested to be an inhibitor of the advanced glycosylation reaction, and 1 g.kg-1.day-1 rutin, an aldose reductase inhibitor, in drinking water were tested. Both treatments had a significant lowering effect on collagen fluorescence in diabetic rats. The mechanisms by which aminoguanidine and rutin prevent the accumulation of fluorescence are unknown, but these observations raise the question of whether they could be identical. If fluorescence is a marker for age-related pathologies and diabetic sequelae, aminoguanidine and rutin could have therapeutic effects in their prevention.\r"

In concordance with previous results, splenocytes from NOD mice do not express the epitope recognized by anti-Ly-6C monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), including MoAb HK1.4 in this study, and cannot be stimulated to proliferate in response to HK1.4. However, when splenocytes from NOD mice were stimulated in vitro with the anti-CD3 MoAb 145-2C11, T lymphocytes expressing Ly-6C were detected after 48 h of stimulation, with as many as 25% of lymphocytes expressing this antigen with prolonged passage in culture. Most of the cells expressing Ly-6C were Thy-1.2+, CD4+, and CD8- and proliferated after stimulation with HK1.4. To further understand the failure of NOD splenocytes to express Ly-6C, freshly isolated cells were stimulated with alpha/beta-interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) and IFN-gamma. Although these lymphokines induced expression of Ly-6A and Ly-6C in splenocytes from C57BL/6J mice and Ly-6A in NOD cells, Ly-6C was not induced on NOD cells. Because Ly-6C expression on splenocytes was a marker of activation via the CD3 T-lymphocyte receptor complex, we also examined expression of Ly-6C on T lymphocytes within islets showing insulitis in vivo. Lymphocytes that were Ly-6C+ were identified within islets on histological sections of pancreas, whereas Ly-6C+ cells in the spleen from the same mouse could not be detected. Our findings imply functional abnormality in expression of Ly-6C in NOD mice.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because a central feature of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is an imparied ability of insulin to enhance glucose disposal in skeletal muscle, we examined the hypothesis that reduced expression of GLUT4 is a characteristic finding in the skeletal muscle of subjects with NIDDM. Biopsies of skeletal muscles were obtained from 17 patients with NIDDM and 10 lean and 9 obese nondiabetic subjects. Among the diabetic subjects, 7 were newly diagnosed and untreated. Compared with age-matched and body-weight-matched healthy control subjects, there was no significant alteration in the level of GLUT4 mRNA demonstrated by Northern blot and slot blot or GLUT4 protein determined by immunoblotting muscle membranes. Neither GLUT4 mRNA nor protein concentration correlated with the degree of glycemic control, fasting plasma insulin or glucose, diabetes duration, body mass index, sex, or age. GLUT1 mRNA and protein levels were also not significantly different between diabetic and matched control subjects. Thus, unlike streptozocin-induced diabetes in rodents, there is no evidence that impaired expression of the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter is responsible for insulin-resistant glucose transport in the skeletal muscle of these lean and moderately obese NIDDM patients.\r"

Conversely, human or rat IAPP-NH2 but not human IAPP-COOH evoked dose-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase in the membranes, and these effects were significantly inhibited by the CGRP-receptor antagonist human CGRP-1(8-37). Moreover, the dose of human or rat IAPP-NH2 necessary for producing half-maximal activation of adenylate cyclase was comparable with that for producing a half-maximal inhibition of the label binding. Thus, IAPP-NH2 but not IAPP-COOH appears to induce adenylate cyclase activation via CGRP receptors on rat liver plasma membranes.\r"

  ".W": "In response to the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987 mandate for the development of a national resident assessment system for nursing facilities, a consortium of professionals developed the first major component of this system, the Minimum Data Set (MDS) for Resident Assessment and Care Screening. A two-state field trial tested the reliability of individual assessment items, the overall performance of the instrument, and the time involved in its application. The trial demonstrated reasonable reliability for 55% of the items and pinpointed redundancy of items and initial design of scales. On the basis of these analyses and clinical input, 40% of the original items were kept, 20% dropped, and 40% altered. The MDS provides a structure and language in which to understand long-term care, design care plans, evaluate quality, and describe the nursing facility population for planning and policy efforts.\r"

Disease-free survival was defined as the interval between entry into the protocol and local recurrence, metastasis, or death (whichever occurred first). All patients had a Stage-IIB intramedullary osteosarcoma--that is, a high-grade malignant tumor (Stage II) with cortical penetration (B). The tumors were subdivided on the basis of the amount of local extension: E1--the tumor touches but does not elevate or penetrate the periosteum; E2--the tumor elevates but does not penetrate the periosteum; E3--the tumor penetrates into, but not through, the periosteum; E4--there is minimum extraperiosteal extension without invasion of another structure, such as a muscle, tendon, or ligament; E5--the tumor invades one additional structure (a muscle, ligament, or tendon); and E6--the tumor invades two or more structures adjacent to the bone. When the tumor had invaded two or more adjacent structures (E6), the instantaneous risk of failure was estimated to be 5.9 times greater than when the tumor had a lesser extent (E1 through E5). The relative prognostic importance of the amount of local extension, the size of the tumor, and the sex and age of the patient was compared with forward step-wise Cox multivariate analysis. Only the amount of local extension had a significant effect on disease-free survival. The estimated cumulative probabilities of disease-free survival at five years, according to the Kaplan-Meier method, were 49.1 +/- 8.5 per cent for patients who had a Stage-IIB tumor, 79.8 +/- 9.3 per cent for those who had a Stage-IIB but not E6 tumor, and 17.6 +/- 11.3 per cent for those who had a Stage-IIB E6 tumor. These data suggest that, with respect to prognosis, there are two distinct subgroups of Stage-IIB osteosarcomas that can be objectively defined by the amount of local extension.\r"

At the time of follow-up, eleven of the twenty-seven patients who had had a primary hip replacement complained of at least moderate pain that limited activities; however, only three patients had to have a revision. The femoral components had a notable tendency to subside more than five millimeters, and in fifteen hips there was radiographic evidence of progressive loosening. Our experience with the self-locking Autophor ceramic total hip prosthesis has been disappointing. We no longer use it.\r"

We studied the results of 238 total hip replacements that had been performed between 1980 and 1983 and that differed only in that 138 of the acetabular components had a metal backing and 100 were made of polyethylene only. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, with three different modes of failure (radiolucency, loosening, and revision), showed a significant increase in the rate of failure of the metal-backed acetabular cup compared with the all-polyethylene cup: radiolucency, 39 compared with 23 per cent (p less than 0.0001); loosening, 4 compared with 2 per cent (p less than 0.0001); and revision, 6 compared with 2 per cent (p less than 0.0034). It was concluded that metal backing cannot be recommended for a cemented acetabular component of a total hip-replacement system.\r"

One hundred and eleven patients also sent recent radiographs. A control group, comprising 100 individuals who did not have scoliosis and had been matched for age and sex, was given the same questionnaire. The study group had more pain in the interscapular and thoracolumbar regions compared with the control group, but there was no difference with respect to pain in the lumbosacral area or the low back. Neither pain nor fatigue was related to the type of curve, the preoperative degree of curvature, the degree of curvature as seen on the most recent radiograph, the extent of fusion into the lumbar spine, or the presence of a broken rod. Twenty-one years after the operation, the patients were functioning quite well compared with the control subjects.\r"

During closure, the wafer was reattached to the broad cancellous surface of the olecranon with sutures through the bone. The elbows were immobilized for an average of sixteen days postoperatively. The patients who were available for follow-up were re-examined at an average of 3.9 years, and the strength of the triceps muscle was checked. No extensor lag or avulsion of the triceps occurred, and mild extensor weakness was seen in only two elbows. No patient had early or late drainage of the wound or infection. The average range of motion compared favorably with that in other reported series. This osteo-anconeus posterior approach is advocated for total elbow arthroplasty because it provides rapid and wide exposure, it is associated with a low rate of complications related to the wound, and it preserves the strength of the triceps.\r"

The fracture loads ranged from 778 to 4,040 newtons and the work to fracture, from five to fifty-one joules. We also investigated the relationship between the fracture loads and several potential indices of bone strength, which were measured non-invasively at the subcapital, basic-cervical, and intertrochanteric regions with quantitative computed tomography. A very high positive correlation with the fracture load resulted from use of an intertrochanteric index--the product of the average trabecular computed-tomography number and the total cross-sectional area of the bone (R2 = 0.93, standard error of estimate = 295 newtons, and p less than 0.00001). We expect the use of this parameter to result in improved assessments of the degree of osteoporosis and of the component of risk of fracture of the hip that is associated with bone strength. However, the measured work to fracture for the isolated femur was an order of magnitude smaller than estimates of the energy available during a typical fall (about 450 joules), suggesting that energy absorbed during falling and impact, rather than bone strength, may be the dominant factors in the biomechanics of fracture of the hip.\r"

By survivorship analysis, the rate of survival of the arthroplasty was calculated to be 70 per cent at five years, but only 40 per cent at eight years. The major cause of failure was aseptic loosening of the acetabular or femoral component, or both. Fracture of the neck of the femur occurred in three hips. Although the medium-term results (at fifty-six to eighty-three months) were better than those in most comparable studies of resurfacing arthroplasty, the poor long-term results (at ninety-one to 118 months) show that meaningful studies of new prosthetic designs must continue for at least eight years, and, if at all possible, must include 100 per cent follow-up. The survival curve for the resurfacing arthroplasties in this study can serve as the basis for comparison of the early, medium, and long-term results of future designs of resurfacing hip prostheses.\r"

The results were compared with those of reconstruction by a microsurgical epineurial-suture technique. The terminal branch of the peroneal nerve to the extensor digitorum longus in thirty-three New Zealand White rabbits served as the experimental model. Histology and neuromuscular function were evaluated at one, two, and six months after repair. When the diameters of the axons and the morphology distal to the site of repair were evaluated, the nerves that had been repaired with the laser more closely resembled those of the control rabbits. Examination of the site of repair also revealed less foreign-body reaction and axonal outgrowth in the laser-repaired nerves than in those that had been reconstructed with epineurial suture. Neuromuscular function was evaluated by measurement of the force of contraction of the extensor digitorum longus after electrical stimulation of the nerve proximal to the site of repair. Functional recovery paralleled the histological findings. At one month, there was no difference in the neuromuscular function that had been achieved with either technique. At two months, the laser-repaired nerves began to show increased muscular strength at higher frequencies of stimulation (sixteen and thirty-two hertz). Six months postoperatively, the nerves that had been repaired with the laser had consistently better neuromuscular function than those that had been repaired by epineurial suture. The improvement was most marked at higher voltages of stimulation (threshold multiplied by ten) and at frequencies of stimulation of more than sixteen hertz.\r"

The average time between removal of the fixator and intramedullary nailing was nine days (range, zero to twenty-four days).

There were two nonunions and one delayed union. Satisfactory alignment was achieved in thirty-seven patients (95 per cent). This sequential protocol for treatment, which involved a short period of external fixation and thus minimized colonization of the pin tracks, yielded excellent results and a low rate of infection.\r"

Growth of each radius, ulna, and proximal and distal physis was followed for eight years. Total radial growth was slightly less on the side that was operated on than it was on the control side. After excision of the radial head, 95 per cent of radial growth came from the distal physis, compared with 71 per cent on the control side. A regenerated radial head, which had an irregular surface of fibrocartilaginous tissue, accounted for the remainder of growth on the side that had been operated on. Incongruous contact of articular surfaces resulted in degenerative changes in the capitellum. The arms that had been operated on were left with a flexion contracture that was an average of 12 degrees greater than that of the normal elbows, and they had a carrying angle that was an average of 6 degrees greater than that on the normal side. The arc of pronation and supination was decreased for the forearms that had been operated on, but motion of the wrist was unaffected. In our study, excision of the radial head in growing monkeys resulted in minimum radial shortening, slight deformity of the elbow, and moderate impairment of rotation of the forearm.\r"

Fusion of bone was obtained in nineteen (73 per cent) of the twenty-six ankles. Failure to obtain fusion was due to postoperative infection in four patients, deficiency of the site of arthrodesis in one patient, and refracture through the site of fusion in two patients. When arthrodesis was successful, additional neuroarthropathic destruction of the mid-tarsal joint was halted, and the preoperative clinical symptoms of dull pain, local warmth, swelling, and instability were relieved.\r"

According to our grading system, seven patients had a good; six, a fair; and eleven, a poor result. All but two of the nineteen patients in whom the humero-ulnar angle had been measured preoperatively lost correction that had been obtained at operation. No correlation was found between the quality of the result and either the age of the patient at operation or the amount of correction that had been obtained at operation. The correction that was obtained at operation was maintained in the two patients in whom the cubitus varus deformity had been caused by malunion of a supracondylar fracture. However, when the deformity followed either physeal injury or supracondylar fracture with damage to the physis secondary to the initial trauma, the correction was not maintained. At the most recent follow-up, three patients were symptomatic, and fourteen were dissatisfied with the cosmetic result because of the residual deformity of the elbow or the postoperative scar, or both. In spite of the partial recurrence of the deformity, which was sometimes severe, all but the three symptomatic patients had a very good functional result.

  ".W": "One of the local complications of certain chemotherapeutic agents is tissue necrosis resulting from extravasation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a conservative approach to treatment in order to minimize necrosis and the need for reconstructive surgery. Fifty-three patients entered this study. Twenty-one had old lesions while 32 had recent extravasations. Drugs responsible for the extravasations were doxorubicin, epirubicin, vinblastine, mitoxantrone, and mitomycin C. The basis of treatment was betamethasone ointment, which was applied to the lesion with a tight elastic bandage and was replaced every 12 hours for the first 2 days and then every 24 hours until complete healing. For old lesions a keratolytic ointment was initially applied, whereas in the new lesions multiple subcutaneous injections with hydrocortisone solution preceded the application of betamethasone ointment. None of our patients developed tissue necrosis and sloughing that necessitated surgery. All lesions healed in patients. Healing time varied with the different drugs used and was proportional to the extension of extravasation and to the time when therapy was begun. We conclude that the application of conservative measures in extravasated areas from chemotherapy may avoid tissue necrosis and reconstructive surgery.\r"

Both shrimp extracts contained acidic proteins (isoelectrofocusing) and demonstrated similar allergenic activity (RAST and RAST inhibition). Shrimp-water extract was analyzed further by immunoprinting with sera from 14 shrimp-sensitive, RAST-positive subjects, and six nonsensitive, RAST-negative individuals. Although none of the sera from shrimp-tolerant individuals reacted, 12/14 sera (85.7%) from shrimp-sensitive subjects reacted with shrimp-water proteins with acid isoelectric points. Shrimp-water extract was fractionated by chromatofocusing with pH and NaCl gradients. A number of eluted ultraviolet-absorbing peaks contained allergens as determined by RAST inhibition. Isoelectrofocusing demonstrated many protein bands present in these peaks, some of which bound IgE from a RAST-positive sera pool. These studies indicate that shrimp water is an excellent source of shrimp allergens, that chromatofocusing is a useful method for fractionation of shrimp allergens, and that shrimp allergens are generally protein molecules with acid isoelectric points.\r"

Changes of metacholine bronchial responsiveness and serum-specific IgE level were also assessed. In five patients who did not take steroids to control their symptoms, both early and late asthmatic responses to inhaled allergen were enhanced after season, whereas IgE serum level, but not methacholine sensitivity, was significantly increased. In six patients who needed steroids, neither responses to allergen nor IgE serum level and methacholine sensitivity were significantly changed after season. For the whole group, the increase in immediate bronchial sensitivity to allergen was positively correlated with the increase in specific IgE antibodies. We conclude that seasonal exposure to pollen has, in sensitized patients, a priming effect on bronchial mucosa that may be blunted by steroid treatment. The increased production of specific IgE antibodies appears to be an important mechanism for this priming effect.\r"

  ".W": "Basophils from approximately one fifth of the population were found to be unresponsive (nonreleasers), in terms of both histamine and leukotriene release, to an IgE cross-linking stimulus, such as anti-IgE antibody. Although unresponsive to any IgE-mediated stimulation, these basophils responded to non-IgE-mediated stimuli, such as the phorbol ester, 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13 acetate, the calcium ionophore, A23187, and to formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide. These stimuli produced equal dose-response curves in both releaser (basophils able to respond with greater than 5% histamine release to anti-IgE antibody) and nonreleaser basophils. Nonreleaser basophils possessed statistically similar densities of cell-surface IgE antibody (287,000 versus 400,000 IgE molecules per basophil for releaser and nonreleaser basophils, respectively), and with 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13 acetate as a probe of anti-IgE-induced cross-linking, the IgE on nonreleaser basophils was found to be cross-linked by the polyclonal anti-IgE antibody used for these studies. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) has previously been demonstrated to enhance markedly both histamine and leukotriene release in human basophils. However, IL-3 was unable to convert nonreleasing basophils into releasing basophils, as measured by anti-IgE antibody. IL-3 equivalently enhanced formyl methionine peptide-induced release in both releaser and nonreleaser basophils, suggesting that the lack of an effect on anti-IgE-induced release was not due to a lack of IL-3 receptors. Although there are several possible interpretations of these data, these results and results of our previous studies of protein kinase C activation and cytosolic Ca++ elevations in human basophils suggest that nonreleasing basophils have a defect in early signal transduction, possibly involving the influx of Ca++.\r"

The bacteriology of chronic sinus disease in these children has not been adequately evaluated. Between May 1987 and January 1988, 12 children (aged 3 to 9 years), all with documented respiratory allergy and chronic respiratory symptoms consistent with chronic sinusitis (greater than 30 days), were fully evaluated. History, physical examination, complete blood count, nasal smear, and Waters x-ray were done. All patients had opacification of one or both maxillary sinuses, failed to respond to multiple courses of antibiotics, and subsequently underwent maxillary sinus aspiration and irrigation. Specimens were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic organisms with standard technique, and sensitivities were obtained. Culture results revealed a single organism (Moraxella [Branhamella] catarrhalis) in five patients, one patient yielded M. catarrhalis plus Streptococcus species, three were negative, and three patients grew multiple organisms (two with multiple aerobic streptococcal species and one patient with aerobic streptococci and Peptostreptococcus). All children received appropriate culture-directed antimicrobial therapy. Sequential biweekly follow-up revealed progressive radiographic clearing and significant symptomatic improvement. M. catarrhalis is a common pathogen, whereas anaerobic organisms are unusual as a cause of chronic maxillary sinusitis in allergic children. Some children, despite negative cultures, may benefit from maxillary sinus irrigation.\r"

Most of the workers exposed to DTFB powder complained of respiratory and mucosal irritation. However, some of these individuals had symptoms typical of occupational asthma. Clinical and immunologic studies, including bronchial provocation testing and specific IgE measurements, were performed on two individuals with asthmatic symptoms associated with exposure to DTFB. These studies confirmed a diagnosis of occupational asthma. In an investigation of 43 other exposed workers in two separate factories handling the diazonium compound, specific IgE antibodies to DTFB-human serum albumin conjugate were found in 20% of individuals. There was a good correlation between specific IgE and exposure-related respiratory symptoms, which suggests an IgE-mediated pathogenesis. DTFB-human serum albumin conjugates were characterized by electrophoretic techniques, and it was found that conjugates prepared at pH 10 elicited optimum IgE binding in RAST. In vitro cross-linking of albumin by DTFB was demonstrated but had no effect on RAST binding. Our findings on the effect of pH and polymerization on IgE binding support proposed mechanisms for in vivo conjugation and provide information on the antigenic determinants important in IgE recognition of hapten-carrier protein conjugates.\r"

Thirty-one of these 101 adults who participated in a study on the outcome of childhood asthma were rechallenged with HD after a mean interval of 16 years to establish the change in airway responsiveness to HD from childhood to adult life. In the childhood study in these 31 subjects, six had no response (NAR); six, an early response (EAR); eight, a late (LAR); and eleven subjects, an EAR followed by an LAR (dual asthmatic response [DAR]) to the inhalation of HD. In the second survey, two of the subjects with NAR in the first study had a bronchoconstrictor response to HD. Five subjects with an EAR or an LAR response in childhood had NAR as an adult. The eleven subjects with a DAR during childhood also had a response to HD as an adult; five had an EAR, and six adults again had a DAR. Eleven of the 13 adults (85%) with current respiratory symptoms had a response to HD during the second survey. Although they were symptom free, 11 of the other 18 adults (61%) responded on inhalation of HD. One of the 18 subjects without (6%), and six of the 13 subjects (46%) with current respiratory symptoms, had a provocative concentration of histamine in FEV1 10% of baseline less than or equal to 16 mg/ml. We conclude that, although respiratory symptoms disappear in one half the children with asthma and although adults may believe that they have outgrown their disease, adults still have the potency to respond to inhaled allergens. Most children do outgrow their respiratory symptoms but not the susceptibility of their airways to allergens.\r"

Antigens similar to three of the four known Sol i venom proteins (I, II, III, and IV) were isolated from Sol r. The N-terminal amino acid sequences for the antigens III were identical; but those for the antigens II demonstrated only nine of 20 residues to be identical. Two monoclonal antibodies raised against Sol i II did not react to Sol r. No protein IV could be detected in Sol r by molecular weight, charge, or immunologically with either polyclonal mouse antibodies or five monoclonal antibodies. Both venoms were compared with a panel of 60 sera from Sol i-allergic individuals; mean bindings were similar with an r = 0.94 for linear regression. RAST inhibition was performed with 17 individual sera representing a variety of Sol i allergen specificities. Four sera were tested from patients resident in the Sol r endemic area and five sera from patients who experienced reactions to S. xyloni stings. All sera reacted comparably to both imported fire ant venoms. The two venoms appear to be allergenically similar, although antigen IV is absent from Sol r and the antigens II have significant sequence variation. Sol i venom appears to be sufficient for diagnostic purposes.\r"

However, this IgG response was similar in responding and nonresponding patients; thus, it did not correlate with the clinical outcome of the therapy. More allergenic compounds were also detected by IgE on immunoblots, but again without correlation to success of therapy. Six years after immunotherapy, the therapeutic effect was still present, although by now the observed immunoglobulin-binding patterns were similar to patterns observed in the same patients' sera collected before the initiation of hyposensitization. Thus, changes of antibody-binding patterns in immunoblot do not relate to the success or failure of immunotherapy.\r"

In view of the uncertainty concerning the structure and biologic properties of human epidermal IL-1, heel stratum corneum, and chamber fluid samples from normal skin have been purified by successive reversed phase and anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and aliquots of each HPLC fraction tested for IL-1 activity in an EL-4 NOB-1 assay and for inflammatory activity by intradermal injection of autologous material. The results consistently indicated the presence of inflammatory quantities of IL-1 alpha-like material, which induced persistent erythema lasting at least 24 h, associated in 4-h biopsies with mixed dermal leukocyte infiltrates containing increased numbers of neutrophils, monocytes, and T helper cells. Biologically active quantities of IL-1 beta were not recovered following HPLC purification in most experiments. Analysis of heel stratum corneum extract also showed that the majority of the dilution-related IL-1 activity detected in the EL-4 NOB-1 bioassay was neutralized by IL-1 alpha but not IL-1 beta antiserum. These findings suggest that IL-1 alpha-like material is present in inflammatory amounts in normal human epidermis, and its release may represent a primary inflammatory mechanism in human skin.\r"

  ".W": "CD4+ T lymphocytes recognize multi-molecular complexes, formed by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules and exogenous antigens, on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC). For most protein antigens, processing is required to produce immunogenic peptide fragments that can then form stable associations with class II molecules. These two processes, the modification of antigen and its coupling to class II molecules, are thought to occur in acidic endosomal compartments. Furthermore, membrane class II molecules are endocytosed in APC and may provide ligands for the immunogenic peptides. To gain insight into these processes, we examined the internalization and acidification of membrane HLA-DR molecules by three APC populations: 1) freshly isolated Langerhans cells (LC), 2) LC after 48-72 h of bulk epidermal cell culture, and 3) peripheral blood monocytes (PBM). Using FITC-conjugated anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), endocytosis was studied by fluorescence microscopy and by flow cytometry (pulse width analysis), while acidification was assessed by exploiting the pH sensitivity of fluorescein fluorescence. We observed both freshly isolated LC and PBM to internalize surface HLA-DR molecules into acidic compartments with great efficiency. Endocytosis was inhibited by the addition of azide and 2-deoxy-D-glucose, whereas acidification was partially blocked by treatment with ammonium chloride or chloroquine. The degree of internalization and acidification of HLA-DR molecules was greatly influenced by the degree of Ab cross-linking. On the other hand, cultured LC were capable of internalizing HLA-DR molecules, but were not able to acidify the environments to which these molecules were delivered; this loss of acidification capacity was partially restored by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

However, their role in the delayed form of hypersensitivity is not yet established. The hypothesis that substance P (SP), neurokinin A (NKA), and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are involved in delayed hypersensitivity was tested in oxazolone-induced, murine ear allergic contact dermatitis. Concentrations of immunoreactive SP, NKA, and CGRP were measured in extracts of the eczema ears (n = 26), whereas extracts of the opposite ears were used as controls. The SP, NKA, and CGRP contents in the treated ears were on the average 28% (p = 0.001), 32% (p = 0.004), and 15% (p = 0.016), respectively, lower than in the control ears. Lower peptide concentrations in the eczema ears indicate increased release of the peptides because the peptides are rapidly metabolized locally when released and only replenished by axonal transport from the cell bodies. Our results indicate that peptides released from primary afferent neurons play a role in the delayed type of hypersensitivity reactions.\r"

We examined the stimulatory capacity of antigen-presenting cells from HPV-infected skin and peripheral blood T-cell responses of patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis. The percentage of Langerhans cells in relation to total epidermal cells in suspension was slightly reduced in HPV-infected lesions, relative to apparently clinically uninfected epidermis. In addition, the morphologic appearance of Langerhans cells was altered in lesional epidermal sheets. Despite these abnormalities, Langerhans cells were functionally intact in their capacity to present alloantigens to T cells and, in fact, the epidermis of HPV-infected lesions demonstrated enhanced antigen-presenting activity in three of four patients tested. The antigen-presenting activity was entirely abrogated by removal of Langerhans cells and was not associated with increased activity of cytokines with stimulatory activity for the thymocyte co-stimulation assay. Although epidermodysplasia verruciformis T cells were unresponsive to autologous HPV-infected epidermis, they responded well to mitogens, allogeneic mononuclear leukocytes, and allogeneic epidermal cells. Epidermodysplasia verruciformis T cells were inhibited in their capacity to respond to allogeneic epidermal cells when they were simultaneously exposed to autologous epidermal cells from HPV-infected lesional epidermis, but not to normal-appearing epidermis. Thus, although Langerhans cell activity is intact in epidermodysplasia verruciformis, these individuals fail to respond to autologous papillomas, which may, at least in part, be explained by an interaction between papillomal epidermal cells and autologous T cells that results in an inhibited response.\r"

We report an action spectrum for the elicitation of phototoxic erythema induced by a second exposure of skin pretreated in this way. After correction for unsensitized skin erythema this action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum of the 4',5'-monoadduct of 8-MOP to DNA. This suggests that the monoadduct is the chromophore for erythema elicited by the second irradiation, and supports the DNA crosslink as the crucial photoproduct causing phototoxic erythema due to 8-MOP in human skin.\r"

Two workers sensitized by occupational exposure to a formulation containing 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT) were also studied. Lymphocytes from nine patch-test-positive patients proliferated vigorously to MCI in vitro. Lymphocytes from the remaining nine patients were not stimulated. Lymphocytes from two BIT-sensitized workers responded to BIT in vitro. The lymphocyte proliferation to isothiazolinones indicates the presence of memory cells in the patients' blood and confirms immunologic reaction to the inducing agent. To establish clinical relevance of LTT results, 12 MCI patch-test-positive patients underwent \"use test\" with lotion containing 15 ppm MCI. Four of five LTT-positive patients were use-test-positive, whereas seven of seven LTT-negative patients were use-test-negative. LTT-positive and lotion-positive patients responded to 100 ppm or lower concentrations of MCI on patch testing, whereas seven of eight LTT-negative and lotion-negative patients responded to 200 ppm only. In the case of MCI, proliferation was due to the chlorinated component, indicating that this part contains an allergenic epitope. Finally, MCI-specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed only in patients with MCI-positive skin test, but not in nine patients with dermatitis induced by other agents, or in seven subjects without skin diseases. Thus, the lymphocyte transformation test is able to distinguish between irritant and allergic skin responses. It may also be valuable in establishing the clinically relevant patch-test concentration of allergens with irritative properties.\r"

In addition, there is an association with vitiligo and ocular depigmentation. To date, the pathomechanisms of the melanocyte effects are unclear. We have studied 10 patients with untreated acute alopecia areata, and three normal patients without hair loss. Morphologic changes, studied by conventional light and electron microscopy, in the cytoplasm of affected melanocytes often predated nuclear hyperchromatism. Increased numbers of bizarre melanosomes were found in affected melanocytes compared with normal ones; such melanosomes had incomplete or \"aborted\" melanization, resulting in poor pigment deposition, and were disrupted, enlarged and rounded, with loss of normal ellipsoidal shape. An unusual outer root sheath (ORS) distribution of hair bulb melanocytes was seen. Other atypical melanosome effects included marked pigment displacement into peribulbar and DP melanophages. In the DP clumped melanin granules formed giant spherical complexes without discernible limiting membranes, which were sometimes associated with lymphocytes. These morphologic changes indicate an active involvement of hair bulb melanocytes in alopecia areata.\r"

  ".W": "Although the clinical effects of acute exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light--such as cutaneous inflammation, malaise, somnolence, chills and fever--have been appreciated many years, the underlying mechanisms mediating these effects are poorly understood. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a potent cytokine with a wide variety of biologic activities, including induction of fever and acute phase response. Because IL-6 is produced by keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro and because the release is enhanced by UV light, the present study was performed to investigate the effect of a single UV dose eliciting moderate to severe sunburn reaction on the production of IL-6 in vivo. Therefore, plasma of UV-treated human subjects was evaluated for IL-6 activity by testing its capacity to induce the proliferation of an IL-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9). In contrast to plasma samples obtained before UV exposure, post-UV-specimens contained significant levels of IL-6 peaking at 12 h after UV irradiation. Plasma IL-6 activity was neutralized by an antiserum directed against recombinant human IL-6, and upon HPLC gel filtration exhibited a molecular weight of around 20 kD. Moreover, plasma IL-6 levels correlated remarkably with fever course followed by an increase of acute phase proteins such as C-reactive protein. These data indicate that IL-6, which is released by keratinocytes following UV exposure, may gain access to the circulation and via its pyrogenic as well as acute phase-inducing effect may function as an important mediator of systemic sunburn reaction.\r"

For these studies, a xenon arc solar simulator was used as the source of UV irradiation, and a chromameter interfaced with a computer for objective measurement of UV-induced erythema and pigmentation was employed. The skin type did not correspond well to the constitutional skin color, as measured by a chromameter prior to UV irradiation. Within each skin type, there were large ranges of MED and MMD values and great variability in the shapes of the dose-response curves. Constitutional skin color was also not a good predictor of the measured MED and MMD values but did appear to correlate with the steepness of the dose-response curves for erythema and for pigmentation. From these studies, we propose that objectively measured constitutional skin color is a better predictor of UV responses of the skin than skin type and that steepness of dose-response curves for erythema is a better measure of the response of the skin to UV irradiation than is a MED measurement.\r"

We investigated whether the biostimulatory effects of HeNe irradiation result from enhancement of keratinocyte proliferation or motility. HeNe effects on keratinocyte motility were evaluated by irradiating a \"wounded\" culture with 0.8 J/cm2 3 times over a 20-h period. At 20 h post-irradiation, videocinemicroscopy and sequential quantitative measurements of the leading edge were taken over a 6-h period. There was a significant difference in migration of the leading edge in irradiated \"wounds\" compared to non-irradiated \"wounded\" controls (12.0 microns/h vs 4.0 microns/h, p less than 0.0001). To determine if the increase in migration observed in irradiated cultures resulted from a proliferative effect of HeNe irradiation, subconfluent human keratinocyte cultures were irradiated with single or multiple doses of different fluences of HeNe irradiation (0.4 to 7.2 J/cm2) and evaluated 72 h post-irradiation. Irradiated and non-irradiated keratinocyte cultures grown on a microporous membrane surface were co-cultured with irradiated and non-irradiated fibroblasts to determine if HeNe irradiation induced a paracrine effect on keratinocyte proliferation. No significant increase in keratinocyte proliferation was demonstrated in any of these treatments. The biostimulatory effects of HeNe irradiation may now be extended to include enhancement of keratinocyte motility in vitro; this may contribute to the efficacy of HeNe irradiation in wound healing.\r"

Comparable resistance emerged during teicoplanin treatment of rabbits with endocarditis caused by the original susceptible parent strain. For the parent strain, spontaneous resistance to teicoplanin at concentrations of 2-10 times the MIC was detected in vitro at frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-9). Similar results were found for isolates of S. aureus from other geographic locations. Resistance was constitutive and not plasmid mediated, and its acquisition was not associated with changes in cytoplasmic membrane proteins. Teicoplanin was less effective than vancomycin at inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis in resistant strains, suggesting that there is differential interference with the access of teicoplanin to or interaction with its target(s). Alternatively, teicoplanin and vancomycin may differ in some detail(s) of their mechanism of action against S. aureus.\r"

To better understand the incidence and factors predisposing to infection and influencing outcome, records of 114 patients with endophthalmitis hospitalized at one institution from 1980 to 1986 were reviewed. An infectious origin was confirmed in 79 patients (69%). The most common pathogens included staphylococcal species (Staphylococcus epidermidis, 33 cases; Staphylococcus aureus, 8 cases), streptococci (18 cases), gram-negative organisms (10 cases), and fungi (7 cases). Predisposing factors for infective endophthalmitis included preceding ocular surgery (67%), penetrating trauma (13%), systemic infection (11%), and periocular infection (5%). Despite vitrectomies and aggressive use of antibiotics, 42 patients (53%) with infective endophthalmitis suffered major visual loss. Morbidity was less pronounced with infection caused by S. epidermidis (23%; P less than .05). Patients with infective endophthalmitis more likely required repeated vitrectomies, were hospitalized longer, and had a worse outcome (as measured by complete enucleation) than those with \"sterile\" endophthalmitis. On the basis of these data, empiric vancomycingentamicin might be initiated in patients with endophthalmitis. Studies to define optimal management are needed, because the morbidity associated with this entity remains pessimistically high despite state-of-the-art treatment.\r"

To investigate this, a site-specific mutation was introduced into a gene (mip) that encodes a 24,000-Da surface protein; an 80-fold loss of infectivity for both U937 cells and explanted human alveolar macrophages was observed. Further phenotypic analysis of the mutant strain has failed to show alterations in bacterial factors (e.g., proteinase, lipopolysaccharide) that have suspected roles in virulence. To substantiate that this mutation also results in reduced virulence in animals, the lethality and clinical illnesses produced by the parent and mutant L. pneumophila strains were compared in guinea pigs after intratracheal inoculation. The mutant strain produced fewer illnesses, slower-progressing disease, and fewer lethal infections than either the parent strain or a derivative of the mutant strain with the wild-type mip gene reintroduced. When sublethal inocula of the three strains were used, the mutant bacteria were recovered in slightly lower numbers from lung homogenates and in significantly lower numbers from the spleen, at 48 h, than were the other two test strains. Thus mip seems to be necessary for full virulence of L. pneumophila and may represent the first genetically defined virulence factor in this species.\r"

Continuous supplemental chlorination of the hot-water system (2 parts per million [ppm]) significantly reduced the number of culture-positive samples from 37.4% (43/115) to 7.0% (8/115) after 6 weeks (P less than .005). Of 30 sites surveyed 6 months after hot-water chlorination, 67% (20) were still culture-negative. Of those positive, 70% had less than or equal to 150 L. pneumophila/ml and 90% were from bathtubs. Adverse effects of chlorination on users and plumbing have not been seen. There have been no definite cases of nosocomial L. pneumophila in areas served by supplemental chlorine during the first 17 months of the chlorination project. Technology allowing tighter regulation of chlorine and use of silicates to control corrosion have made continuous hot-water chlorination a safe and effective option in Legionella control.\r"

C3H/He, SWR, C57BL/6, SJL, and BALB/c mice inoculated at age 3 days developed uniformly severe polyarthritis at 30 days after intraperitoneal inoculation. Mice inoculated at age 3 weeks also developed polyarthritis, but severity was influenced by genotype, with C3H/He and SWR mice the most severely affected. Susceptible strains developed higher IgG ELISA antibody titers to B. burgdorferi than did resistant mice. Adult (12 weeks) C3H/He mice were also susceptible, but arthritis was not as severe as in those inoculated at age 3 weeks. SKH (hairless) mice developed polyarthritis but not skin disease when inoculated intradermally. Carditis occurred frequently among C3H/He, BALB/c, and hairless mice and in some SWR mice but not in C57BL/6 or SJL mice. This study demonstrates that severity of Lyme borreliosis is age- and genotype-dependent and that laboratory mice are a potentially valuable model.\r"

BM CSF TNF alpha (less than 35 to greater than 25,500 pg/ml) correlated with CSF bacterial density (P less than .01), CSF protein (P less than .001), endotoxin (LPS) in gram-negative disease (P less than .01), and consecutive febrile hospital days (P less than .001); initial CSF TNF alpha greater than 1000 pg/ml was associated with seizures (P less than .05). Only 5 children with BM (13%) had detectable plasma TNF alpha activity on admission. A higher proportion who died had detectable plasma TNF alpha activity compared with survivors (3/4 vs. 2/34, P less than .005). Platelet-activating factor (PAF) in CSF was higher in 19 children with Haemophilus influenzae meningitis than in 17 controls (P less than .01) and correlated with bacterial density (P less than .01), CSF LPS (P less than .01), CSF TNF alpha levels (P less than .01), and the Herson-Todd severity score (P less than .01). Elevated CSF TNF alpha and PAF are often present in children with BM and are associated with seizures and severity of disease. Detectable CSF TNF alpha appears to distinguish BM from viral meningitis.\r"

O-side-chain-reactive MAbs produced immunofluorescence against homologous, smooth strains up to 500-fold higher than controls. Many core- and lipid A-reactive MAbs exhibited limited reactivity with smooth bacteria. Some core- and lipid A-associated epitopes, however, were better recognized by MAbs on intact bacteria than on isolated LPS. FACS analysis of binding by the core-reactive MAb, J8-4C10, to E. coli O26:B6 smooth bacteria revealed staining and non-staining bacterial phenotypes that were sorted and stably expressed in subculture. FACS analysis thus documented differences in the whole-cell reactivity of MAbs specific for various LPS subcomponents, differences in MAb reactivity with isolated and cell-associated LPS, and spontaneous changes in the phenotypic expression of certain LPS-associated epitopes on intact bacteria.\r"

However, data relevant to host defense mechanisms directed against this organism are scarce. The ability of H. pylori-specific antibody and complement to enhance the in vitro phagocytosis and killing of H. pylori by human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) were studied. Sera with IgG antibody to H. pylori from five children with culture-proven H. pylori gastric disease markedly enhanced complement-dependent phagocytosis of H. pylori in an assay using flow cytometry to measure uptake of fluorescent-labeled bacteria by PMNL. Absorption of specific antibody from patient sera with an excess of H. pylori organisms completely abrogated this enhancement. IgG purified from plasma with high IgG antibody titers to H. pylori enhanced complement-dependent phagocytosis of H. pylori and increased the killing of this organism by PMNL in the presence of 5% human opsonic complement by one full log. IgG antibody to H. pylori appears to be highly functional in vitro in promoting complement-dependent phagocytosis and killing of H. pylori by PMNL.\r"

The antibody sources were IgG1 or IgG2 subclass polyclonal antibody fractions prepared by immunoabsorption of sera from adults immunized with PRP or PRP-diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine or clonally purified anti-PRP antibodies from eight adults immunized with PRP vaccine. In bactericidal assays using an inoculum of 3 x 10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml, twofold lower concentrations of IgG1 compared with IgG2 antibody were required for 50% killing. With approximately 10(6) cfu/ml, IgG1 antibody killed 3 logs more of bacteria than were killed by comparable concentrations of IgG2 antibody. The IgG1 antibody also required lower concentrations of complement than did the IgG2 antibody for comparable bacteriolytic activity. Clonally purified IgG1 and IgG2 anti-PRP antibodies from most individuals showed similar relative differences in bactericidal activity. IgG1 anti-PRP antibody was also more efficient than IgG2 anti-PRP antibody in enhancing the uptake of radiolabeled type b H. influenzae by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the presence of complement and in protecting infant rats from developing bacteremia. However, the differences in opsonic or protective activity of the two subclasses were smaller than the differences in bactericidal activity. Thus, IgG1 anti-PRP antibody is functionally more effective than IgG2 antibody, but it is likely that both subclasses can confer protection against disease.\r"

Rabbits with chronic abscesses did not produce serum opsonic factors that enhanced bacterial killing. A bactericidal assay performed with chronic abscess fluid in the suspending medium revealed inhibition of neutrophil killing. The inhibition could be replicated with a neutrophil lysate but not by an S. aureus supernatant. Rabbits with chronic abscesses have diminished blood neutrophil bactericidal capacity and superoxide formation, and the abscess fluid milieu is inhibitory to neutrophil function.\r"

The toxic and antifungal effects of AmB with and without the vascular decongestants pentoxifylline (PTX) and a methylxanthine analog, HWA-138, were compared in the murine model of candidiasis. At 48 h after inoculation with Candida albicans, half of the rats received a single intravenous 0.8 mg/kg dose of AmB whereas the others were administered sterile water. After 1 h, rats were randomized to receive three doses of 45 mg/kg PTX intraperitoneally, 5 mg/kg HWA-138 intravenously, or saline every 12 h. Renal function and Candida cell counts were estimated 24 h after AmB administration. Mean inulin clearances were significantly greater in rats coadministered AmB and PTX or HWA-138 than in AmB controls. Candida counts in kidneys of rats administered HWA-138 were similar independent of AmB therapy and markedly reduced compared with other groups. Whereas both vascular decongestants prevented drug-associated renal toxicity, the coadministration of AmB with HWA-138 resulted in a profound antifungal effect.\r"

Prevalence of infection was 17.7% in sheep and 10.4% in cattle and was significantly higher in lambs and calves (35.6% and 27.7%, respectively). Naturally infected lambs released cysts intermittently for months. Giardia trophozoites from sheep had typical claw hammer-shaped median bodies and were successfully cultured in TYI-S-33 medium, and cytosolic, cytoskeletal, and membrane fractions exhibited protein profiles similar to human isolates (WB). Immunoblotting showed that sera from infected sheep recognized human Giardia, sera from patients with giardiasis recognized Giardia from sheep, and in both cases recognition involved antigenic proteins of similar molecular weight. Cyst output and clinical signs in ovine infection resemble human disease and the organisms infecting humans and ruminants are morphologically and antigenically similar. It is postulated that domestic ruminants may be a reservoir for human infection and vice versa, thus classifying giardiasis as a zooanthroponotic disease.\r"

Two patients also had other pulmonary infections at death; one had only HSV pneumonia. All had received prophylaxis and repeated treatment courses with acyclovir, and all initially had acyclovir-sensitive virus. The acyclovir-resistant HSV strains were sensitive to foscarnet, and in at least one case to vidarabine, but as expected were resistant to ganciclovir. These cases represent potentially severe visceral infection in which acyclovir-resistant virus strains were primary or important copathogens. Although acyclovir-resistant HSV is generally considered less virulent, these cases illustrate the potential importance of infection due to acyclovir-resistant HSV in severely immunocompromised patients. They also highlight the need to test HSV strains for antiviral sensitivity and to consider alternative therapies to acyclovir in appropriate clinical situations.\r"

The purpose was to distinguish CSF profiles of the two groups despite contamination with peripheral blood elements. In each case, white blood cell (WBC) counts were observed (O) and compared with those predicted (P), calculated as P = CSF RBC X (blood WBC/blood RBC). Comparison of O:P ratios revealed that all 30 patients with bacterial meningitis had ratios greater than or equal to 1, 28 (93%) had ratios greater than 10, and 24 (80%) had ratios greater than 100; by contrast, only 2 patients (3%) with culture-negative CSF had ratios greater than 10, 21 (34%) had ratios of 1-10, and 39 (63%) had ratios less than 1. Significant differences were observed in the rate of O:P ratio greater than or equal to 1 (100% vs. 32%), CSF differential cell count predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (97% vs. 11%), hypoglycorrhachia (73% vs. 3%), and positive Gram's-stained smear for pathologic organisms (80% vs. 0) in those with and without bacterial meningitis, respectively (P less than .0001). Thus, in children greater than 1 month of age, CSF abnormalities associated with bacterial meningitis are rarely obscured by blood contamination from traumatic lumbar puncture.\r"
