In fact, there have already been numerous published studies on this topic drawing the same broad conclusion. Attention is drawn to these studies, and their findings are described. A fresh approach to research in this area is called for.\r"

MRI, computed tomography (CT) and certain radionuclide studies are compared in the evaluation of intracranial tumours, cerebral vascular disease, multiple sclerosis and other white matter diseases, dementia, head injury, infection, epilepsy, spinal lesions and in paediatric central nervous system disorders. The measurement of cerebrospinal fluid volumes and dynamics by MRI is discussed. MRI most clearly has advantages where CT is degraded by bone hardening and streak artefacts (spine, skull base, posterior and temporal fossa, sella and parasellar regions) and in diseases in which the X-ray attenuation of the suspected lesion differs little from normal parenchyma (paediatric brain disorders, demyelination and dysmyelination, early oedema associated with infarction, infection or low-grade infiltrating neoplasm, subacute and chronic haemorrhage and lesions in the spinal subarachnoid space and cord). Elsewhere MRI and CT should be seen as complementary rather than competitive methods of imaging. In spite of an absence of information about the contribution of MRI to management decisions and a lack of rigorous, prospective controlled trials, MRI will play an increasing role in the diagnosis of diseases of the central nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "In a retrospective study, we compared the use of computer-generated spectral electroencephalographic descriptors with a neurologist's interpretation of raw EEG data. Data were collected from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and anesthetized with isoflurane in nitrous oxide and oxygen. The EEG was recorded on magnetic tape during the period immediately before and after occlusion. These tapes were then analyzed off-line using a computer to generate averaged changes in 18 spectral descriptors. A strip-chart of raw EEG before and after the carotid occlusion was interpreted by a neurologist, who assigned changes in the EEG following occlusion to one of four visual inspection groups, depending on the severity of change. A descriptive examination of the distribution of changes in spectral descriptors revealed that no single descriptor adequately reflected the neurologist's interpretation of the raw EEG. Using data from 20 patients, the percent change from preocclusion to postocclusion values for total power, spectral edge frequency, spectral variance, and log spectral variance was examined. Only for the visual inspection group judged by the electroencephalographer to have the most severe ischemic change was there a significant difference in total power and log spectral variance. Although computer-processed EEG devices are of value as trending devices for detecting visual patterns associated with inadequate cerebral perfusion, single descriptors in this study did not consistently reflect a neurologist's diagnosis of ischemia. Single descriptors of spectral EEG analysis may not be sufficient to use as alarm variables in the recognition of cerebral ischemia.\r"

The high-dose regimen consisting of twice the standard dose of cisplatin (P), along with vinblastine (Ve), bleomycin (B), and the epipodophylotoxin etoposide (VP-16) (V) (PVeBV) was compared to the classic regimen with normal dose cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin (PVeB). Eligibility criteria included large abdominal masses, liver metastases, multiple pulmonary metastases, brain metastases, marked elevations in serum tumor markers (alpha-fetoprotein greater than 1,000 ng/mL or the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin greater than 10,000 mIU), unfavorable histology (pure choriocarcinoma), or extragonadal germ-cell tumors. Fifty-two consecutive patients with poor prognostic features were randomized to receive either PVeBV or PVeB. The median follow-up is 4 years. Treatment with the high-dose regimen increased the complete remission rate (88% v 67%, P = .14) and was associated with a lower relapse rate (17% v 41%, P = .2). The median survival of patients receiving standard therapy was 30 months, while the median survival for patients receiving the high-dose regimen has not been reached. Actuarial 5-year survival for patients treated with the high-dose regimen is 78%, compared with 48% for patients receiving standard therapy (two-sided Mantel-Cox test = .06). Disease-free survival was also superior for patients randomized to PVeBV (P = .03). Sixty-eight percent of patients (23 of 34) randomized to PVeBV are alive and continuously disease-free, compared with 33% (six of 18) for PVeB (P = .02). The major difference in toxicity between the high-dose regimen and standard therapy was the severity of myelosuppression and the incidence of severe hearing loss. Ninety-one percent of patients treated with PVeBV had a WBC count less than 1,000/microL, compared with 50% of patients receiving PVeB (P less than .05). Hearing aids were recommended for 12 patients who received PVeBV and two who received PVeB. The increased effectiveness of the PVeBV regimen in poor prognosis germ-cell cancer patients may relate to the double-dose cisplatin, the addition of VP-16, or to a synergistic effect of these two drugs.\r"

Because circulating B cells may be a part of the neoplastic clone, we examined peripheral blood B cells that were producing the same cytoplasmic light chain isotype as the patient's monoclonal; protein (M-protein) and determined the peripheral blood LI (PBLI) by a two-color immunofluorescence bromodeoxyuridine method. The 105 patients studied were divided into three disease activity groups by standard clinical criteria. Median PBLI was 0.2% for the 29 patients with inactive monoclonal gammopathies (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS] and smoldering multiple myeloma [SMM]), 0.8% for the 35 patients with new, untreated multiple myeloma (MM), and 1.7% for the 41 patients with relapsed MM. These differences between groups were statistically significant (P less than .001, Wilcoxon). Four patients had high PBLI but clinically inactive gammopathy at the time of study, and all developed active MM within 6 months that required treatment. In 92 patients a BMLI was performed simultaneously with the PBLI (rank correlation coefficient, 0.69). In patients with new, untreated MM, use of both tests identified 72% of patients (23 of 32) with high LI, rather than 56% (18 of 32) by BMLI alone or 63% (20 of 32) by PBLI alone. These results suggest that PB B cells bearing the same cytoplasmic light chain isotype as the monoclonal protein are part of the malignant clone and can be kinetically active. The LI of these cells can provide a measure of disease activity and may help to differentiate active from inactive disease.\r"

  ".W": "The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) colorectal adjuvant study 7510 went through two phases. From 1975 to 1977, 309 patients were randomized to chemotherapy alone or the same chemotherapy plus immunotherapy. From 1977 until 1980, 317 patients were randomized among the same two therapy programs and a control group. With a minimum follow-up in either phase of greater than 7 years, data are now mature. They show no difference in relapse-free survival (RFS) nor overall survival (OS) in either the two-way phase or in the three-way phase. There is no indication, except possibly in one very small subset, that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy provides an improvement in OS or in RFS. Using data from patients accrued after randomization to the control group, we fail to find evidence that either chemotherapy alone or chemoimmunotherapy improves OS or RFS when contrasted to outcomes obtained by patients on the control arm. In fact, we have significant evidence, at the P = .016 level, that chemotherapy does not improve OS by at least 50%; we also have significant evidence, at the P = .011 level, that chemoimmunotherapy will not improve OS by at least 25%. No evidence of efficacy was demonstrated for either treatment regimen, even though enough therapy was given to result in significant toxicities. Acute toxicity was at least moderate, but not fatal, in 75% of patients. Recognizable delayed toxicity included rare cases of fatal renal failure and acute leukemia.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have indicated that sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC) can reduce cisplatin's (CP) toxic effects without altering the antitumor activity. DDTC has also been shown to have immunostimulative properties. Sixty patients with objectively measurable recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck were randomized to receive either (A) CP at 120 mg/m2 over one hour on day 1, plus fluorouracil (5-FU) at 1,000 mg/m2 over 24 hours as a continuous infusion on days 1 through 5, or (B) CP/5-FU as in A, plus DDTC at 600 mg/m2 over 30 minutes administered intravenously (IV) exactly 30 minutes after CP infusion. Group B also received DDTC at 200 mg/m2 administered IV over 30 minutes on days 8 and 15. Each cycle was repeated at 3-week intervals. Objective responses were achieved in 41% of the CP/5-FU group and in 29% of the CP/5-FU with DDTC group (P = .26). Median survival was 9 months in group A and 10 months in group B. CP-related toxicity between the groups was equivalent with respect to nausea and vomiting, renal impairment, neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, and hematologic toxicity. The pharmacokinetics of reactive platinum species in plasma ultrafiltrate and urine samples obtained from both groups were comparable. The immune status of 48 patients was evaluated before and after completion of therapy. There were no significant differences in mean pretreatment and posttreatment values within or between groups A or B, except for absolute pretreatment OKT4 values (P = .02). We conclude that (1) the present dose and infusion schedule of DDTC did not significantly reduce CP-mediated toxic effects, (2) DDTC did not alter the disposition of ultrafilterable platinum species, (3) DDTC did not affect immune responses, and (4) the addition of DDTC improved neither the clinical response nor the survival of patients with recurrent SCC of the head and neck.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that sequential scheduling of methotrexate (MTX) and fluorouracil (FU) produces a synergistic antitumor effect, we randomized 113 patients with recurrent or locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck to receive MTX-FU either 18 hours apart or simultaneously, with leucovorin rescue. There were 100 patients with locally advanced newly presenting disease and 13 patients with recurrence. Excessive toxicity was observed in the first 11 patients who received MTX 250 mg/m2 administered intravenously (IV) and leucovorin at 36 hours, therefore all subsequent patients received MTX 200 mg/m2 administered IV and leucovorin at 24 hours. FU 600 mg/m2 IV was administered to all patients, and treatment was given on days 1 and 8 of 21-day cycles. The treatment groups were well balanced for known prognostic variables. The response rate was 47.3% (26 of 55) for simultaneous v 44.8% (26 of 58) for sequential therapy. These results exclude a 20% difference in response rate favoring sequential therapy at P = .04. There was no observed difference in survival between the two treatment arms (P = .55) with a minimum follow-up of 8 months. Toxicity was greater in patients who received sequential therapy, and the difference was confined to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A comparison of the distribution in maximum Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) toxicity scores during chemotherapy for the two treatment groups showed greater stomatitis (P = .001), diarrhea (P = .04), and overall toxicity (P = .02) for sequential treatment without an observed difference in bone marrow toxicity. The results of this trial indicate that sequential MTX-FU is not superior to simultaneous therapy for the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. Biochemical modulation of MTX-FU by drug scheduling may occur in vivo and may be organ specific.\r"

  ".W": "Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system (CNS), including reticulum cell sarcoma, microglioma, and histiocytic lymphoma, represents less than 1% of all primary brain tumors. In the last 10 years, this tumor has tripled in frequency in the nonimmunosuppressed population. By 1991, the tumor will be the most common neurological neoplasm by virtue of the increase in sporadic occurrence and in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) population. Three percent of AIDS patients will develop this tumor either prior to AIDS diagnosis or during their subsequent course. In addition to acquired immunosuppression, patients with inherited disorders (such as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, severe combined immunodeficiency, and X-linked immunodeficiency) and other acquired disorders of the immune system are predisposed to the development of CNS lymphoma. Immunological studies have suggested a role for Epstein-Barr virus in the production of this tumor. Although subtypes exist, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the CNS most commonly consists of histiocytic cells or large immunoblastic cells bearing B cell surface markers in close proximity to the lateral and third ventricles. Sixty percent of these deposits are multiple, and subarachnoid invasion is seen in one-quarter of patients. Vitreous involvement of the eye occurring prior to and during the course of CNS lymphoma has been noted in up to 25% of patients. The involvement of multiple areas of the neuraxis, the eye, and multiple intracranial sites often occurs in the absence of obvious systemic lymphoma. Therapeutic trials of brain radiation therapy are associated with median survivals of less than 1 year. Uniform complete responses of intracranial deposits are recorded following chemotherapy with high-dose intravenous methotrexate, CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin/doxorubicin, Oncovin (vincristine), and prednisone), high-dose cytosine arabinoside, and intra-arterial methotrexate with barrier modification.\r"

Despite the presence of necrosis and mitoses, clinical follow-up studies have revealed a lack of aggressive tumor behavior after surgery alone. The discrepancy between the histological and clinical features in these cases is emphasized so that excessive treatment of a basically low-grade tumor may be avoided.

  ".U": "88229857\r", 
  ".W": "The monoclonal antibody Hy2D4 was found to label a previously undescribed subset of rat and human anterior pituitary cells. The antibody binding site appears to be a carbohydrate moiety previously named \"X hapten.\" Double-label immunofluorescence studies in both normal rat and postmortem human pituitaries showed that this antigen is distributed on a subset of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-positive cells, but is not detectable in cells immunoreactive for growth hormone, prolactin (PRL), thyroid-stimulating hormone, or luteinizing hormone. Since X hapten labeling revealed a biological subdivision of corticotroph cells, it was expected that some ACTH-positive tumors would be immunoreactive, but that tumors of other hormonal types would be negative. Instead, in 21 surgical specimens examined, tumors of all hormonal types were found to show immunoreactivity. To determine whether experimental proliferative changes in the pituitary could explain the shift in the cell type expressing the antigen, PRL-cell hyperplasia was induced in rats through chronic (8-week) exposure to diethylstilbestrol. The fraction of X-positive cells increased in these hyperplastic glands almost ninefold and, as in human adenomas, many non-corticotroph cells expressed the X marker in this model. However, the non-corticotroph cells expressing X were predominantly growth hormone cells, not the proliferative PRL cells. Thus, expression of the antigen does not necessarily imply that a cell is in a proliferative mode. While it is not known what role an altered expression of this antigen might play, the antibody offers a probe into cellular biology of human and experimental pituitary tumors.\r"

LIP must be a prime consideration in the differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary gallium uptake in pediatric AIDS patients. Further experience will afford greater perspective on the diagnostic role that nuclear medicine will ultimately play in this disease.\r"

Discrete deposits of fat or islands of normal tissue which are uninvolved by fatty infiltration may stand out as potential space-occupying lesions on the sonograms. Twelve patients with such focally abnormal ultrasound images were referred for liver scintigraphy with 133Xe and 99mTc colloidal SPECT studies to clarify the issue. These examinations helped identify, in nine of 12 patients, the innocent nature of the sonographic abnormalities which were simply related to the fat deposition process. Further, [99mTc]RBC scans defined the additional pathologic process in three patients in whom actual space-occupying lesions were indeed present in the liver. Scintigraphy has an important role to play in the understanding of focal hepatic ultrasound abnormalities particularly in unsuspected hepatic steatosis.\r"

The case presented demonstrates the characteristic scintigraphic findings of osteitis condensans of the clavicle. A review of the published pathologically proven cases reveals this disorder to have distinctive clinical and radiological features that allow differentiation from infection, neoplasia, and arthritides in most instances. The frequent observation, as in this case, of devitalized bone and marrow fibrosis with remodeling of cancellous bone suggests that osteonecrosis may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

Furthermore, PET studies can accurately differentiate patients who will or will not benefit from revascularization procedures. In patients with partial epilepsy being considered for surgery, PET studies provide spatial localization of the focus that complements other tests in improving the surgical management of these patients. PET studies give important diagnostic and prognostic information in the management of patients with gliomas and can direct recurrence of tumor and distinguish it from radiation necrosis. These uses of PET are well documented, and their utility has been independently confirmed in several institutions. Several other areas of research are being pursued with PET, and these will probably develop into clinically useful procedures in the future.\r"

In contrast, a diet low in protein and phosphorus may have adverse effects on calcium balance in the elderly. Studies with adults suggest that high protein foods do not cause calcium loss.\r"

Uterine and ovarian volumes were calculated and the ovarian morphologic picture was classified as homogeneous, nonhomogeneous (less than three small cystic areas), microcystic (four or more small cystic areas less than 9 mm in diameter), follicular (at least one cystic area greater than 9 mm), and macrocystic (large cystic area greater than 20 mm). Ultrasound imaging allowed an easy distinction between true precocious puberty and premature thelarche or idiopathic premature adrenarche. It was also helpful in the diagnosis of transient sexual precocity, although in these cases the differential diagnosis of precocious puberty can be difficult. In postmenarcheal patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, ultrasound study showed a low uterine volume and, frequently, a macrocyst in the ovary. In hirsute girls and in a few obese patients, ovaries had an increased volume and a microcystic structure, similar to those in polycystic ovary syndrome. Pelvic ultrasonography can be useful not only in diagnosing disorders in sexual development but also for greater understanding of the pathogenesis of these and other disorders.\r"

Cranial abnormalities detected by ultrasonography at each postnatal age of examination were classified as minor (periventricular superolateral echogenicity with or without intraventricular hemorrhage, grades 1 to 3) or major (cystic periventricular leukomalacia with or without intraventricular hemorrhage, grade 4) and correlated with neurodevelopmental outcome determined by 1 year of age. Major abnormalities detected by ultrasonography were present in four infants at 1 week, four at 2 weeks, eight at 3 weeks, and 11 infants at 6 weeks and 40 weeks PCA, respectively. Nineteen infants (17%) had moderate to severe functional handicaps defined as cerebral palsy, cognitive or visual deficit, or deafness. The positive and negative predictive values of ultrasound examinations, with regard to later neurodevelopmental outcome, improved with increasing postnatal age at examination and was best at 40 weeks PCA. Negative results of ultrasound study at 40 weeks PCA most correctly predicted satisfactory outcome. Although only 58% of moderately to severely handicapped infants were correctly identified by ultrasound examination at 40 weeks PCA, all infants with major ultrasonographic abnormalities at 40 weeks PCA had moderate or severe handicap. Our data demonstrate that the timing of cerebral ultrasonography is important in the prediction of later neurodevelopmental outcome in high-risk preterm infants.\r"

In 34 of 36 breast carcinomas examined, the basal and luminal cell-specific antibodies showed complementary patterns of reactivity, while in the remaining 2 specimens, neither antibody was reactive. The findings reported in this study demonstrate that expression of subclass-specific keratins is mutually exclusive not only in normal and benign mammary specimens but also in breast carcinoma.

This difference was statistically highly significant. A mean of 106 cinoxacin tablets per patient were administered during post-coital prophylaxis. Cinoxacin represents an additional valuable and effective antibacterial in post-coital prophylaxis of recurrent urinary tract infection in otherwise healthy premenopausal women, although it is slightly less effective than cotrimoxazole or nitrofurantoin. Effective post-coital prophylaxis requires the use of much smaller quantities of antibacterial agents than the daily use of a single tablet and in women with a high incidence of recurrent urinary tract infections it is superior to intermittent self-administered antibacterial therapy.\r"

Histological lesions were observed in the colon near the bladder colon junction in US rats exclusively. These lesions included dysplasias (5/23), cystic glands (4/23) and 10 neoplasms (9/23), three of which were adenomas, showing elements of juvenile polyp and tubular adenoma in one case. The seven other tumors showed typical histological features of colonic adenocarcinomas, but no frank evidence of parietal tumoral invasion was observed and their cancerous nature was questionable. It is probably a true carcinogenesis since we induced the same histological changes as those in the mucosae adjacent to colonic adenocarcinomas after human US surgery. Moreover, by immunoperoxidase using antibodies against mucus associated antigens (M1 and M3C antigens) we demonstrated that US rat carcinogenesis differs from dimethylhydrazine (DMH) rat carcinogenesis. Furthermore, our results suggest that urine may be an important factor in inducing this type of US carcinogenesis.\r"

Nine years after operation the patient was in good health without evidence of other aneurysms. Thirty-two cases of probable congenital abdominal aortic aneurysms were collected from the literature. In 19 cases, the cause of aneurysm was not ascertained. We identified two groups of patients with probably congenital AAAs: type I congenital AAA, in which there is a generalized disorder of the arterial tissue and usually aneurysms are present in other areas and type II congenital AAA, in which there is a localized defect of the abdominal aorta, without aneurysms in other areas. We speculate that a congenital defect localized to the wall of the abdominal aorta was the cause of the aneurysm in this patient (type II congenital AAA).\r"

There is growing awareness, as evidenced by recent reports, that heparin has a small but definite incidence of causing thrombocytopenia (6 to 8 days after initiation of therapy) associated with platelet aggregation causing intravascular thrombosis, with potentially devastating morbidity and mortality. We review this phenomenon and bring attention to a recent case that resulted in a 10 X 19 cm full-thickness skin necrosis of the thigh. This case clearly implicates heparin as the \"aggregating factor\" of platelets, resulting in intravascular thrombosis. No risk factors have been identified that place a patient at increased risk for this phenomenon. This disorder occurs in patients who have received all forms of heparin. Therefore all patients receiving heparin are considered at risk. Early recognition of thrombocytopenia in patients receiving heparin will alert the physician to this disorder.\r"

Nineteen percent of the evaluations used three terms appropriately, 48% used one or two terms, and 33% used none. Data were presented appropriately for one or more of the five terms in 59% of evaluations. A \"gold standard\" comparison with the results of an independent procedure, such as surgical or autopsy findings, was presented in 22% of evaluations. Results of another imaging procedure were described in 63% of evaluations. Only one evaluation clearly described a prospective study design, although 11 evaluations apparently were planned in advance. Not one evaluation contained an appropriate statistical analysis of the distributions of quantitative readings, \"blinded\" image readers to diagnosis or other test results, measured observer error, or randomized the order of magnetic resonance imaging and other imaging procedures. We conclude that health care professionals paying for expensive innovative diagnostic technology should demand better research on diagnostic efficacy.\r"

We developed a local registry of 2147 informed donors who consented to be listed in the Bone Marrow Donor Registry. This registry was used to carry out 420 donor searches for 351 patients. The initial computer search involved matching for HLA-A and HLA-B locus antigens only because most donors had not been typed for HLA-DR antigens. Depending on the degree of HLA-A and HLA-B antigen mismatching allowed, suitably matched (HLA-DR-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture nonreactive) donors were located for 6% to 16% of patients. This resulted in 13 bone marrow transplants. This study shows that a small, local bone marrow donor registry can locate donors for a few patients; however, a large network involving an expanded number of donors will be necessary to allow an extensive evaluation of unrelated bone marrow transplantation.\r"

A plasma captopril level of 27,391.1 nmol/L (5982 ng/mL) was documented, as well as a depressed level of angiotensin converting enzyme. Captopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor used in the management of hypertension and ventricular failure; to our knowledge, this is the first case of an acute captopril overdose reported in the English-language literature.

Following disapproval, 22 patients were admitted immediately, 44 received outpatient care, and eight additional outpatients were not evaluated or treated. The remaining 26 patients subsequently were admitted with preadmission approval due to changed clinical condition or failed outpatient plan. Although some patients had minor problems that their physicians believed would have been avoided by immediate admission, no severe morbidity resulted from admission delay. Many physicians expressed concern about preadmission certification program-related patient anxiety and inconvenience. Although this limited survey provides preliminary evidence that preadmission certification programs can be implemented without major deleterious short-term medical effects, continued monitoring of physicians and patients involved in disapproved admissions is necessary to evaluate potential medical and psychosocial problems.\r"

Patients with symptomatic heart failure despite digitalis and diuretic therapy were studied; most were middle-aged men and approximately half had coronary artery disease. Results of the trials were appraised by three independent observers, and mortality and functional status outcomes were pooled in a meta-analysis. All vasodilator agents except hydralazine hydrochloride were associated with improvements in functional status. Angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitors were the only agents associated with both decreased mortality (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.75) and improved functional status (odds ratio, 4.53; 95% confidence interval, 3.46 to 5.92).

However, standards for exchanging clinical information between independent computers are needed to eliminate the reentry or interfacing costs otherwise required to obtain data from computerized ancillary services. Three kinds of benefits may be expected: (1) improved logistics and organization of the medical record to speed care and improve care givers' efficiency, (2) automatic computer review of the medical record to limit errors and control costs, and (3) systematic analysis of past clinical experience to guide future practices and policies.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the incidence of Escherichia coli 0157:H7 enteric infections in the United States and to evaluate the vehicles of transmission for sporadic cases, we conducted a one-year, population-based study at a large health maintenance organization (HMO) in the Puget Sound area of Washington State. All stool specimens submitted for culture to the HMO laboratory were screened for E coli 0157:H7; the organism was identified in 25 (0.4%) of 6485 stool specimens. All patients with E coli 0157:H7 identified had diarrhea; 24 patients (96%) had bloody diarrhea. Exposure histories demonstrated that rare ground beef was consumed more often by patients (21%) than by age-matched control subjects (4%) in the week before onset of illness. Raw milk also was consumed by two patients but by none of the control subjects. Incidence rates for laboratory-confirmed enteric infections in the HMO population were as follows: Campylobacter, 50/100,000 person-years; Salmonella, 21/100,000 person-years; E coli 0157:H7, 8/100,000 person-years; and Shigella, 7/100,000 person-years. The organism is a more common pathogen in the United States than is generally recognized, and the diagnosis should be considered for patients with suspected enteric infection.\r"

  ".W": "All randomized controlled trials of adjuvant therapy of colorectal cancer, published up to December 1986 in English, were reviewed. Eight trials compared radiotherapy groups with control groups in rectal cancer (3062 patients), and 17 trials compared chemotherapy groups with control groups in colorectal cancer (6791 patients). The results of trials testing radiotherapy or chemotherapy were combined. Fluorouracil-containing regimens resulted in a small benefit of therapy in terms of overall survival, with a mortality odds ratio of 0.83 in favor of therapy (95% confidence interval, 0.70 to 0.98). All other combinations of trials failed to show statistically significant differences between treated and control patients, even though the odds of death tended to be slightly lower in treated patients, especially those with rectal tumors. Some overall survival benefit from adjuvant therapy cannot be excluded, but it is likely small. Such small benefit, if real, would be far from negligible in a common case of malignancy with long survival expectancy. Trials much larger than those published up to now are needed.\r"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of plasma concentrations of these compounds to tumor stage and the effect of surgical resection on plasma prostaglandin levels. Blood samples were obtained from 40 patients with head and neck cancer. Ten treated patients were clinically disease-free (NED), and 30 patients with active disease were previously untreated at the time of this study. Plasma concentrations of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin were measured by radioimmunoassay of their stable metabolites thromboxane B2 (TxB) and prostaglandin 6-keto-F1 (PGI). Platelet aggregation was performed with normal donor platelets (PRP) and normal control or patient plasma (PPP). TxB and TxB/PGI ratios were increased in T1N0M0 patients, compared with NED and with T4N0M0 primary lesions versus all other groups. With lymphatic and hematogenous metastases, TxB and TxB/PGI ratios fell to NED levels. ADP-induced platelet aggregation was significantly increased in head and neck cancer patients, compared with normal controls, and with T4N0M0 lesions, compared with NED. There were no significant differences in PGI levels. TxB, PGI, TxB/PGI, and platelet aggregometry did not change significantly with curative surgery. TxB and TxB/PGI interactions are involved in head and neck cancer. Changes in TxB and TxB/PGI may be related to increased platelet aggregation.\r"

Segmental allograft recipients were immunosuppressed with total lymphoid irradiation (TL1) and cyclosporine (CSA). After 100 days, islet function was assessed, at which stage immunosuppression was terminated. Glucose, insulin, glucagon, and C-peptide response was assessed during intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and during arginine and tolbutamide stimulation. In eight normoglycaemic primates in which immunosuppressive treatment had been stopped and with mean graft survival of 145 days, islet stimulation was associated with moderate glucose intolerance, reduced K-values, hypoinsulinaemia, and low C-peptide values. Postmortem findings in all animals intentionally killed revealed severe graft atrophy in the absence of significant rejection. Severe graft atrophy in normoglycaemic primates, together with significantly impaired graft function after segmental pancreatic transplantation compared to normal animals, suggest that transplantation of the whole pancreas may be mandatory if normal or near-normal function is to be achieved.\r"

Of these 65 donors, 46 had normal studies, nine had pericardial effusions, five had mild septal hypokinesia with otherwise normal function, four had equivocal mitral valve prolapse, and only one heart could not be visualized. All transplants were successful and all donor hearts exhibited satisfactory hemodynamic function immediately after transplantation, including the hearts that were mildly abnormal before transplantation. These hearts included 21 (29%) that could have been excluded by conventional screening criteria. Nine potential donor hearts with grossly abnormal echocardiograms were not used for transplantation, including eight hearts with severe hypokinesia and one heart with significant mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Inspection or histologic analysis confirmed the presence of severe dysfunction or morphologic damage in those hearts subjected to these additional measures. We conclude that echocardiographic screening is a useful method of evaluating potential cardiac transplant donors. It can identify potential donors that would otherwise have been excluded and it can identify potential donors with severe cardiac dysfunction without the need for direct surgical inspection.\r"

Free radical scavengers have been shown to protect the anoxic myocardium by preventing damage to the cell membrane and may, therefore, be effective in extending successful preservation of donor hearts. We perfused 10 sheep hearts for 8 hours in an ex vivo perfusion system. The effect of superoxide dismutase combined with catalase, 60,000 units/L, was studied in five sheep, and five received placebo. Control determinations and determinations after 8 hours of preservation were obtained with the heart perfused with autologous blood at 37 degrees C at an aortic perfusion pressure of 60 mm Hg and flow of 180 to 200 ml/min. After control readings, the hearts were arrested and perfused with a cold (6 degrees to 8 degrees C) oxygenated buffered crystalloid solution with or without superoxide dismutase and catalase at a perfusion pressure of 30 cm H2O for 8 hours. Left and right ventricular compliance was measured sequentially with separate intraventricular balloons. After 8 hours of ex vivo preservation, hearts receiving superoxide dismutase and catalase had significantly better left and right ventricular performance, higher myocardial oxygen consumption, and lower lactate production than the control group. The hearts preserved with superoxide dismutase and catalase showed significantly better left and right ventricular compliance, much less increase in heart weight, and no change in the diastolic pressures. The results suggest that superoxide dismutase combined with catalase may be effective in extending ex vivo preservation of hearts for cardiac transplantation.\r"

Antibiotic therapy yielded rapid symptomatic and biochemical improvement, and histologic changes in the small bowel occurred subsequently. Despite antimicrobial therapy, relapses in patients with Whipple's disease are common, and the central nervous system is considered the most serious site of involvement for recurrence. Administration of an antibiotic agent that is able to cross the blood-brain barrier may be more important in preventing relapse than prolonged duration of initial antimicrobial therapy.\r"

Endoscopy can be performed to identify the active site of hemorrhage and is associated with an overall diagnostic accuracy that exceeds 90% in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The rate and character of observed bleeding have substantial predictive value for continued bleeding. The mortality among high-risk patients with bleeding in either the upper or the lower gastrointestinal tract ranges from 17 to 44%. Therefore, an organized aggressive approach to management of acute gastrointestinal bleeding is necessary.\r"

The deleterious effects of abnormal blood lipid concentrations have long been recognized, but the benefit of corrective intervention in this process has only recently been demonstrated. We review the major lipid abnormalities and the available clinical therapeutic interventions. In addition, we discuss data that address the premise that reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol should decrease the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, and we summarize drug trials in which clofibrate, niacin, cholestyramine, and gemfibrozil decreased coronary heart disease events. Studies that used cholestyramine and the combination of colestipol and niacin resulted in decreased progression of coronary artery disease. On the basis of early experience with lovastatin, inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase are likely to be effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The available information on the association of low cholesterol levels and cancer suggests that low total cholesterol is a consequence rather than a cause of carcinoma. Current data strongly support the concept of vigorous intervention directed at management of lipids, both with non-pharmacologic treatment and with drug therapy, for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary atherosclerosis.\r"

Observations that certain medications could improve or worsen mood led to the development of hypotheses describing the possible role of specific neurotransmitters in the brain in depression. Modifications of these original hypotheses focused on altered receptor function, failures in the regulation of neurotransmitter systems, and interactions of the monoamines with cholinergic systems. Strategies using endocrinologic measurements in the evaluation of the depressed patient have provided researchers with new clues regarding disordered neuroendocrine function in depression and clinicians with new tests to aid in diagnosis and management. Moreover, the development of standardized sleep EEG methodology has proven useful for the identification of characteristic sleep abnormalities in depression. Although there are many methodologic and clinical problems still to be resolved, the use of biological markers in the assessment of the depressed patient is increasing, and is likely to be of significant importance in the future. Finally, recent advances in molecular genetics hold promise for further advances in our understanding of the inheritance and biochemistry of depression.\r"

Where diagnosis is precise and complicating organic factors have been excluded, true treatment resistance in either anxiety disorders or depression is rare. Proper patient education to assist compliance, adequate dosage of individual agents, patience to give the medication time to work, overcoming the reluctance to attribute the patient's problem to a medically treatable disorder rather than to moral or characterologic defect, and the flexibility to shift to other or to additional medications on encountering initial treatment resistance are the keystones to the successful management of more than 90 per cent of all cases.\r"

Many of these patients will benefit from psychiatric consultation when the diagnosis is unclear or when the patient is not responding to treatment. Good communication between referring physician, consulting physician, and patient are essential to ensure a good result. Specific problems that should lead to consultation include: patient's request, unclear diagnosis, poor results from treatment, and crisis situations such as suicide attempts. Consultation-liaison psychiatry services in the primary care setting are becoming more popular and are an excellent way of improving communication between primary care physicians and psychiatrists. Further development of this role of the psychiatrist in the primary care setting has great potential of improving the quality of care delivered patients with psychiatric problems who seek care from their primary care physician. It appears that the majority of patients continue to seek care for their psychiatric symptoms from their primary care physician. Open communication and ease of consultation with psychiatrists can make the care of these patients even more rewarding to the primary care physician.\r"

Treatment was continued for three months, outcome measures being major or minor embolism or haemorrhage. 2 patients in each group had major embolic events and 11 in each group had minor embolic events. The 95% confidence intervals on the differences are -3.4% to 3.2% for major embolism and -9.3% to 8.2% for minor embolism. Haemorrhagic complications were significantly more frequent with standard treatment (15 patients) than with the less intensive regimen (6 patients); and of the 5 patients with major haemorrhagic complications, all were in the standard treatment group, again a significant difference. The less intensive regimen is thus no less effective and safer than standard anticoagulant therapy in patients with tissue heart valve replacement.\r"

These four painters may have been heavily exposed to mercury sulphide, cadmium sulphide, arsenic sulphide, lead, antimony, tin, cobalt, manganese, and chromium, the metals of the bright and clear colours, and exposure to these metals may be of importance in the development of inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Artists today are not so exposed, but heavy metal contamination in food and drinking water exists and experience from the occupational exposure of old masters is still relevant.\r"

The two randomly selected groups were comparable in terms of age, sex, smoking habits, and alcohol consumption.

After 1 year, 8 (53%) of the hypnotherapy patients and 15 (100%) of the control subjects had relapsed.

CF infants had 25% higher rates of energy expenditure when compared with data derived from measurements of TEE obtained by the same method in 16 healthy infants, matched for age and body weight. Mean TEE (SEM) for CF was 950 (38) kcal, vs 876 (72) kcal for controls matched for age and 758 (46) kcal for controls matched for weight. Although subclinical disease activity cannot be excluded as a determinant of the excess TEE, the possibility of an energy-requiring basic defect is suggested, because further analysis indicated that factors other than body weight, degree of underweight, presence of pancreatic insufficiency, or presence of lung disease were important. Increased TEE may contribute to undernutrition in CF, even in the absence of chronic lung disease.\r"

There was no difference between the groups in proportions responding to therapy or proportions dying from infection, except when non-evaluable patients were excluded from the group with definite bacterial infection, in which case response was better among those treated with ceftriaxone. The groups did not differ in number of side-effects, but therapy had to be discontinued because of treatment failure, an adverse effect, or death in 1 of 53 patients given ceftriaxone and in 11 of 34 given the combination. Use of ceftriaxone was 107.36 pounds ($182.51) cheaper per patient, and saved 40 minutes of nursing and drug administration time per patient per day. Thus 2 g ceftriaxone given once a day is at least as effective and costs less in time and money than gentamicin plus cefuroxime for the initial treatment of patients with serious systemic bacterial infections.\r"

An ultrastructural study of the round window membrane of rhesus monkeys disclosed three basic layers: an outer epithelium, a middle core of connective tissue, and an inner epithelium. Morphologic evidence in monkeys, cats, and chinchillas suggests that these layers of the round window participate in absorption and secretion of substances to and from the inner ear, and that the entire membrane could play a role in the defense system of the ear. Cationic ferritin, horseradish peroxidase, 1-micron latex spheres, and neomycin-gold spheres placed in the middle ear of these experimental animals were observed to traverse the round window membrane through pinocytotic vesicles. Three-micron latex spheres and anionic ferritin were not incorporated by the membrane. Cationic ferritin and 1-micron latex spheres placed in perilymph were incorporated by the inner epithelial cells, suggesting absorptive capabilities of the round window membrane. Cationic ferritin was observed within the mesothelial cells underlying the scala tympani side of the basilar membrane, suggesting a role for these cells in the inner-ear defense system. A review of the subject and a general perspective from the author's viewpoint are discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The distribution of muscle involvement, assessed clinically and electromyographically, was analyzed prospectively in 55 consecutive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients and in 54 patients with other predominantly motor syndromes, some of whom were referred with suspected ALS. In ALS patients, distal limb muscles and thoracic paraspinal muscles were affected most frequently, more so than proximal limb and cranial muscles. The incidence of bulbar symptoms in ALS was greater in women than in men. These patterns suggest selective vulnerability of specific neuronal populations. The vulnerability of truncal muscles, illustrated by thoracic paraspinal wasting or head and shoulder drooping, was a helpful differential sign in diagnosing ALS. Thoracic paraspinal electromyography was especially valuable in distinguishing ALS from other disorders, such as combined cervical and lumbar spondylotic amyotrophy or polymyositis, which may masquerade as ALS. The finding of denervation atrophy on biopsy of thoracic paraspinal muscles was diagnostic in difficult cases. Because the thoracic paraspinal muscles are frequently affected in ALS and spared in spondylotic amyotrophy, their assessment provides a practical strategy in differentiating ALS from other motor syndromes.\r"

CAPD and related procedures are still evolving and improving. Efforts to reduce the rates of peritonitis are ongoing and should decrease the rates of treatment dropout and increase the use of this alternative method of dialysis. Continued research toward improvements in catheter configuration and connection devices and the tailoring of technique to meet the particular needs of patients have made peritoneal dialysis an acceptable replacement therapy in patients with end-stage renal disease. Neither peritoneal dialysis nor hemodialysis is the superior long-term dialysis therapy for all patients; the choice depends on numerous medical, social, geographic, and life-style considerations.\r"

  ".W": "To confirm reports that skin cancer can be prevented with retinoids, we conducted a three-year controlled prospective study of oral isotretinoin (also called 13-cis retinoic acid) in five patients with xeroderma pigmentosum who had a history of multiple cutaneous basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinomas. Patients were treated with isotretinoin at a dosage of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight per day for two years and then followed for an additional year, without the drug. Before, during, and after treatment, biopsies of all suspicious lesions were performed, and skin cancers were surgically removed. The patients had a total of 121 tumors (mean, 24; range, 8 to 43) in the two-year interval before treatment. During two years of treatment with isotretinoin, there were 25 tumors (mean, 5; range, 3 to 9), with an average reduction in skin cancers of 63 percent (P = 0.019). After the drug was discontinued, the tumor frequency increased a mean of 8.5-fold (range, 2- to 19-fold) over the frequency during treatment (P = 0.007). Although all patients experienced mucocutaneous toxic effects, and triglyceride, liver-function, or skeletal abnormalities developed in some, high-dose oral isotretinoin was effective in the chemoprophylaxis of skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.\r"

  ".W": "For many non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the bcl-2 gene has been implicated as a likely proto-oncogene, since it is consistently located at or near the breakpoint sites of t(14;18) chromosomal translocations. To define the role of the protein product of the bcl-2 gene in lymphoid cancers, we used anti-bcl-2 antibodies to perform immunohistochemical studies of frozen sections of 136 tissue specimens affected by lymphoma or non-neoplastic lymphoid disorders. Immunoreactive bcl-2 protein was observed in the neoplastic cells in almost all the follicular lymphomas, whereas no bcl-2 protein was detected in follicles affected by non-neoplastic processes or in normal lymphoid tissue. Every tumor with molecular-genetic evidence of t(14;18) translocation expressed detectable levels of bcl-2 protein, regardless of whether the breakpoint was located in or at a distance from the bcl-2 gene. These data show consistent expression of a proto-oncogenic protein in a large proportion of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and provide further support of a role for bcl-2 in the pathogenesis of all lymphomas with the t(14;18) karyotypic abnormality. Increased expression of bcl-2 after t(14;18) translocations may be a specific marker for B-cell cancers, and demonstration of the protein with use of anti-bcl-2 antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis of many non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "The diversity of its causes, the unpredictability of its clinical course, and our expanding knowledge of the conditions that may exacerbate or retard its progression suggest that glomerular sclerosis cannot be attributed to a single aberration in glomerular physiology. Nonetheless, the welter of clinical and experimental observations is beginning to yield a pattern. Agents or conditions injurious to glomerular epithelium tend to cause glomerular sclerosis. Agents or conditions that induce short-term or long-term activation of mesangial cells may lead to glomerular sclerosis. Indeed, one contribution of the healthy epithelium may be to serve as a tonic inhibitor of the intraglomerular processes arising from mesangial-cell activation. Long-term activation of the mesangium is associated with the proliferation and infiltration of cells and with the expansion of the mesangial matrix--the antecedents of sclerosis. We anticipate that different diseases associated with glomerular sclerosis will be found to depend to varying extents on these two potential mechanisms of sclerosis. Beyond a certain threshold of glomerular injury, glomerular diseases share an additional factor: the capacity of both intrinsic cells and infiltrating cells to alter the microenvironment of the glomerulus so that sclerosis progresses inexorably long after the disappearance of the initiating insult. Several potential risk factors may contribute to the progression of chronic renal disease. These factors include systemic hypertension, proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, high protein intake, and probably conditions that lead to glomerular hypertrophy. Interventions designed to minimize the potential contribution of these factors to the progression of renal insufficiency may halt or slow the loss of function of the kidney. Clinical trials designed to examine the effects of these factors on the progressive course of renal insufficiency will help to establish their role and relative importance in humans.\r"

To evaluate the use of colchicine (1 mg per day, five days per week) in the treatment of hepatic cirrhosis, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which 100 patients were followed for up to 14 years. Forty-five patients had alcoholic cirrhosis, 41 had posthepatitic cirrhosis, and the remaining 14 had cirrhosis with various other causes. Histologic studies were available for 92 percent of patients. Seventy-three patients were in Child-Turcotte class A, 26 were in class B, and one was in class C. Fifty-four patients received colchicine, and 46 received placebo. The overall survival in the colchicine group was markedly better than in the placebo group (median survival, 11 and 3.5 years, respectively; P less than 0.001). The cumulative 5-year survival rates were 75 percent in the colchicine group and 34 percent in the placebo group; the corresponding 10-year survival rates were 56 percent and 20 percent. Among the 30 patients treated with colchicine who underwent repeated liver biopsies, histologic improvement was seen in 9; the liver appeared normal in 2, and 7 had minimal portal fibrosis. No histologic improvement was observed in the 14 members of the placebo group who had two or more biopsies. Few side effects were observed in either group.\r"

  ".U": "88232846\r", 
  ".W": "To examine the role of antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of arterial restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 376 patients. The active treatment consisted of an oral aspirin-dipyridamole combination (330 mg-75 mg) given three times daily, beginning 24 hours before PTCA. Eight hours before PTCA, the oral dipyridamole was replaced with intravenous dipyridamole at a dosage of 10 mg per hour for 24 hours, and oral aspirin was continued. Sixteen hours after PTCA, the initial combination was reinstituted. Treatment was continued in patients with a successfully dilated vessel until follow-up angiography four to seven months after PTCA--or earlier, if symptoms dictated. Of 249 patients who underwent follow-up angiography, 37.7 percent of patients receiving the active drug had restenosis in at least one segment, as compared with 38.6 percent of patients taking placebo (P not significant). The number of stenotic segments was virtually the same in the two groups. Among the 376 randomized patients, there were 16 periprocedural Q-wave myocardial infarctions--13 in the placebo group and 3 in the active-drug group (6.9 percent vs. 1.6 percent, P = 0.0113). Although the use of this antiplatelet regimen before and after PTCA did not reduce the six-month rate of restenosis after successful coronary angioplasty, it markedly reduced the incidence of transmural myocardial infarction during or soon after PTCA. Thus, the short-term use of antiplatelet agents in relation to PTCA can be recommended.\r"

Sequencing of the groEL gene and the complementary cDNA encoding the chloroplast protein has revealed that these proteins are evolutionary homologues which we term 'chaperonins'.

Assisted post-translational assembly of oligomeric protein structures is emerging as a general cellular phenomenon.\r"

The gene responsible for the disease has been cloned from knowledge of its map location at band Xp21 on the short arm of the X chromosome. The product of the DMD gene, a protein of relative molecular mass 400,000 (Mr 400K) recently named dystrophin, has been reported to co-purify with triads of mouse and rabbit skeletal muscle when assayed using polyclonal antibodies raised against fusion proteins encoded by regions of mouse DMD complementary DNA. Here we show that antibodies directed against synthetic peptides and fusion proteins derived from the N-terminal region of human DMD cDNA strongly react with an antigen present in skeletal muscle sarcolemma on cryostat sections of normal human muscle biopsies. This immunoreactivity is reduced or absent in muscle fibres from DMD patients but appears normal in muscle fibres from patients with other myopathic diseases. The same antibodies specifically react with a 400K protein in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) extracts of normal human muscle subjected to Western blot analysis. We conclude that the product of the DMD gene is associated with the sarcolemma rather than with the triads and speculate that it strengthens the sarcolemma by anchoring elements of the internal cytoskeleton to the surface membrane.\r"

Three such RNAs have been sequenced. One of them that is 221 nucleotides (nt) long ('MDV-1' RNA) has been found to be partially homologous to Q beta phage RNA 8, which might be considered as an indication of its origination from by-products of the Q beta RNA replication. To gain further insight into the origin and function of these RNAs, we have sequenced a new RNA, 120 nt long, isolated from the products of spontaneous synthesis by the nominally RNA-free Q beta replicase preparation. The minus strand of this RNA appeared to be a recombinant RNA, composed of the internal fragment of Q beta RNA (approximately 80 nt long) and the 33-nt-long 3'-terminal fragment of E. coli tRNA(1Asp). This seems to be the first strong indication of RNA recombination in bacterial cells. The various implications of this finding are discussed.\r"

One population of glial cells in this tissue, the type-1 astrocytes, secrete a soluble factor(s) which promotes division of a second population of bipotential oligodendrocyte/type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells; these progenitors give rise to oligodendrocytes, which myelinate large axons in the CNS, and type-2 astrocytes, which enwrap bare axons at nodes of Ranvier. Type-1 astrocytes also promote progenitor motility, and inhibit the premature differentiation of progenitors into oligodendrocytes which occur when these cells are grown in the absence of type-1 astrocytes.

We have studied a population of bipotential glial (O-2A) progenitor cells in the developing rat optic nerve that gives rise to oligodendrocytes beginning at birth and to type-2 astrocytes beginning in the second postnatal week. Whereas, in vivo, these O-2A progenitor cells proliferate and give rise to postimitotic oligodendrocytes over several weeks, in serum-free (or low-serum) culture they stop dividing prematurely and differentiate into oligodendrocytes within two or three days. The normal timing of oligodendrocyte development can be restored if embryonic optic-nerve cells are cultured in medium conditioned by type-1 astrocytes, the first glial cells to differentiate in the nerve: in this case the progenitor cells continue to proliferate, the first oligodendrocytes appear on the equivalent of the day of birth, and new oligodendrocytes continue to develop over several weeks, just as in vivo. Here we show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can replace type-1-astrocyte-conditioned medium in restoring the normal timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro and that anti-PDGF antibodies inhibit this property of the appropriately conditioned medium. We also show that PDGF is present in the developing optic nerve. These findings suggest that type-1-astrocyte-derived PDGF drives the clock that times oligodendrocyte development.\r"

Acidic character is a feature of the structural motif, possibly a dimer of alpha-helices from two GCN4 monomers, that may be important for interactions with the basic transcriptional machinery.\r"

  ".W": "A novel approach to the study of the control of the mammalian cell cycle was opened by the cloning of a human gene by complementation of a fission-yeast cdc2 cell-cycle mutant. We have investigated the behaviour of the RNA and protein products of this human gene, CDC2Hs, and its murine equivalent, CDC2Mm during serum starvation and re-feeding of cultured fibroblasts. In contrast to the pattern of wild-type cdc2+ expression in fission yeast previously described, the mammalian homologue displays variation in both RNA and protein levels during exit from and re-entry into the mitotic cycle. Like its yeast counterpart, however, the mammalian CDC2 protein (p34CDC2) becomes dephosphorylated upon shifting from exponential growth to quiescence, and rephosphorylated late in the G1 phase when cells are stimulated to re-enter the cycle. We propose that phosphorylation of p34CDC2 serves as a regulatory mechanism generally in eukaryotic cells, while transcriptional control of the CDC2 gene in higher eukaryotes may be relevant to long term processes such as senescence and differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "The use of insulin as an injected therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes has been one of the outstanding successes of modern medicine. The therapy has, however, had its associated problems, not least because injection of insulin does not lead to normal diurnal concentrations of insulin in the blood. This is especially true at meal times when absorption from subcutaneous tissue is too slow to mimic the normal rapid increments of insulin in the blood. In the neutral solutions used for therapy, insulin is mostly assembled as zinc-containing hexamers and this self-association, which under normal physiological circumstances functions to facilitate proinsulin transport, conversion and intracellular storage, may limit the rate of absorption. We now report that it is possible, by single amino-acid substitutions, to make insulins which are essentially monomeric at pharmaceutical concentrations (0.6 mM) and which have largely preserved their biological activity. These monomeric insulins are absorbed two to three times faster after subcutaneous injection than the present rapid-acting insulins. They are therefore capable of giving diabetic patients a more physiological plasma insulin profile at the time of meal consumption.\r"

Three other patients were investigated with transcranial Doppler sonography before, during, and after recurrent bleeding, and their hemodynamics were studied. There is conclusive evidence that acute spontaneous SAH is often followed by an intracranial circulatory arrest lasting for several minutes and caused by a peak of ICP in the range of mean arterial levels. The mechanisms involved are discussed. There are strong indications that this temporary intracranial circulatory arrest promotes hemostasis, but may constitute a severe ischemic event.\r"

EEG potentials were recorded directly from the cortical surface using a bipolar disc electrode grid and were analyzed by computer. Groups of 5 animals each underwent temporary occlusion of the left middle cerebral arterial trunk for 5, 10, 20, 30, 45, or 60 minutes. EEG data were recorded from the cortex proximal (temporal site) and distal (parasagittal site) to the middle cerebral arterial trunk during occlusion and 2 hours of reperfusion. EEG suppression was detected immediately after occlusion at the temporal site by analysis of power spectra in 29 of 30 rabbits (mean power, 32% of base line), by compressed spectral array (CSA) edge analysis in 23, and by analysis of the conventional EEG wave form in 24. Within 5 minutes after the start of occlusion, all 30 rabbits showed EEG power suppression and 26 showed decrease in the CSA edge frequency or in the routine EEG wave form. By the end of the occlusion period, EEG power at the temporal site had decreased to 20.5% of base line. At the parasagittal site, a lesser degree of EEG suppression was detected; 20 rabbits had an initial loss of EEG power (mean, 85.7% of base line), 13 had decrease in the CSA edge, and 7 had suppression of the EEG wave form. By the end of the occlusion period, spectral power at the parasagittal site had decreased in 25 of 30 rabbits to a mean of 86.9% of base line.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This paradigm appears to be challenged by observations that amniotic band syndrome occurs in monozygotic twin gestations. The exclusive development of amniotic band syndrome in monozygotic versus dizygotic twin gestations, the description of early amniotic rupture in one sac of a dizygotic twin gestation without subsequent fetal abnormalities, and the paradoxical observations of discordance in monoamniotic and concordance in diamniotic twin gestations, fail to support an \"exogenous\" etiology for amniotic band syndrome.\r"

Only one case exhibited papillomavirus antigen reactivity. Alternatively, seven of twenty cases (35%) yielded positive results for HPV 6 or 11 DNA; one papilloma exhibited a dual infection with both HPV 2 and 6 when assayed under conditions of high-stringency hybridization. It is concluded that some oral squamous papillomas harbor HPV genotypes akin to those encountered in genital tract condylomas. Viral DNA can be detected in the absence of capsid antigen immunoreactivity, thereby obviating the use of antigen detection assays for determining the presence or absence of virus.\r"

Immunohistochemical staining and electron microscopic observation provided further evidence of the biphasic nature of this cell population. Twelve similar cases were found in the literature under a variety of diagnostic or descriptive labels. Our findings show that these lesions are histiocytic in nature and that they range from small, innocuous lesions, which we regard as the osseous counterpart of non-X histiocytosis, to larger, more destructive lesions diagnosed as benign fibrous histiocytoma (fibrous xanthoma) of bone.\r"

Microscopically, the mandibular lesion had the features of a benign myxomatous neoplasm with the exception of occasional atypical spindle cells. Electron microscopic observation confirmed the undifferentiated nature of the neoplastic cells. It was concluded that the intensive chemotherapy that was administered to our patient very likely affected the histologic appearance of the mandibular metastasis as well as other recurrent lesions in the abdomen. Our review of the literature revealed only five previous examples of Wilms' tumor that had metastasized to the mandible. At least one of these earlier cases also represented a CCSK.\r"

Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in children have lagged behind those in adults owing to diminished familiarity with the disease and difficulty in performing clinical studies in children. Tuberculosis in the United States now occurs mainly in clusters of high-risk people, such as the foreign born, Hispanics, blacks, Native Americans, and the impoverished. In general, the diagnosis of tuberculosis is epidemiologic, supported by the chest roentgenogram, skin test, and, most important, contact tracing. As the rate of drug-resistant tuberculosis increases, greater effort should be made to obtain cultures. New advances, such as DNA probes and serodiagnosis, may improve diagnostic accuracy, especially for extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Noncompliance is the major problem in treating tuberculosis, and greater effort should be directed toward novel treatment approaches in children, such as twice-weekly supervised therapy and shorter, more intense durations of therapy.\r"

The CSF is abnormal in over 90 per cent of cases. The EEG, CT, and MRI will further help in detecting focal encephalitis. The clinician caring for a child with focal encephalitis should institute broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy plus acyclovir, pending definitive diagnosis by ancillary tests or brain biopsy, which is positive for HSE 33 to 55 per cent of the time and is diagnostic for other treatable conditions 10 to 20 per cent of the time. Acyclovir is the drug of choice for HSE and substantially reduces mortality and morbidity. The management of HSE in a child requires an experienced team of specialists and laboratory support in a tertiary intensive care setting.\r"

Tunneled silicone catheters are the route of choice for long-term or outpatient use, particularly for oncology or TPN patients; insertion of such a catheter should occur early in the hospitalization of a newly diagnosed patient on chemotherapy. The greatest experience has accrued with the cuffed silicone catheters (for example, Broviac), but the totally implantable devices (for instance, Port-a-cath) may become the device of choice in pediatric outpatients. For infants, small, percutaneously inserted noncuffed silicone catheters appear to offer the greatest safety. Among acute care patients, percutaneous plastic central venous catheters fulfill a vital role but represent an important source of infection. Scrupulous technique, the minimizing of manipulation, and a readiness to replace the catheter at any suggestion of trouble are important to achieving the best results. Within a given design, it is generally best to use the smallest diameter catheter capable of performing the desired tasks. However, on the basis of currently available data, there need be no hesitation to use a multilumen catheter if the care of the patient demands multiple access ports. The various silicone catheters can usually be left in place while infection is treated, although fungal and certain other infections are more likely to require catheter removal. Percutaneous plastic catheters should be removed or changed over a wire if infection is suspected; if tip culture of the removed catheter is positive, and the catheter was replaced over a wire, then the replacement catheter should be promptly removed.\r"

Successful repair depends on understanding and using the principles of wound healing. The skin's greatest strength is in the dermal layer, and the best repair results when the entire depth of the dermis is accurately approximated to the entire depth of the opposite dermis. Accurate coaptation of the epidermis gives a polished effect to the repair but does not contribute to its strength. Fat and muscle do not support sutures. Full-thickness sutures may safely be used only on palmar and plantar surfaces. With an extensive laceration or one near a joint, a splint or sling may be needed.

When DNA extracted from these sources was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, negative results were obtained from focus assays. Cotransfection of these DNA samples with a gene for resistance to G418, followed by selection for resistance to that antibiotic, and tumorigenicity testing in nude mice demonstrated DNA-mediated transfer of the neoplastic phenotype in all cases except for DNA from the nontransformed cell line. DNA extracted from these primary nude mouse tumors used in a secondary round of transfection with NIH 3T3 cells gave positive results in focus assays, which were conserved through succeeding rounds of transfection. By use of appropriate radiolabeled probes, activated ras oncogenes were detected in all samples. N-ras activation was detected in three of the primary rat liver tumors and both hepatoma cell lines. Ki-ras activation was detected in one primary rat liver tumor, and Ha-ras activation was detected in the cell line transformed in vitro with activated aflatoxin B1. The activated Ki-ras oncogene was further characterized by use of synthetic oligonucleotide probes and was shown to contain a G----A transition at the second nucleotide in codon 12.\r"

This DNA strand-transfer activity increases greater than 15-fold during meiosis in MATa/MAT alpha diploids prior to the detection of a 100- to 1000-fold increase in homologous chromosomal recombination. No increase is observed in MATa/MATa or MAT alpha/MAT alpha cells, which do not undergo meiosis when shifted to meiotic medium, suggesting the activity is related to meiotic recombination. The activity is named strand-transfer protein alpha (STP alpha) and has been extensively purified from the meiotic cells (6 hr after exposure to sporulation medium). The apparent molecular mass of STP alpha is 38 kDa under denaturing conditions. The DNA strand-transfer reaction catalyzed by STP alpha requires homologous single-stranded and double-stranded DNA and Mg2+ but no nucleotide cofactor. Yeast single-stranded DNA binding proteins stimulate the reaction at least 10-fold. Among the products analyzed by electron microscopy were typical strand-exchange structures.\r"

The two leader open reading frames, if translated, would produce peptides 20 and 41 residues in length. The deduced amino acid sequence of the cpc-1 polypeptide, CPC1, contains segments similar to the DNA-binding and transcriptional activation domains of GCN4, the major cross-pathway regulatory protein of yeast. The structural and functional similarities of CPC1 and GCN4 proteins suggest that cpc-1 encodes the analogous transcriptional activator of N. crassa. Messenger RNA measurements indicate that cpc-1 is transcriptionally regulated in response to amino acid starvation. The segment of CPC1 similar to the DNA-binding domain of GCN4 also is similar to the DNA-binding domains of the avian sarcoma virus oncogene-encoded v-JUN protein and human c-JUN protein.\r"

The enzyme, termed MAP kinase, was isolated from insulin-treated or control cells radiolabeled with 32Pi. A 40-kDa phosphoprotein was found to elute in exact correspondence with enzymatic activity during hydrophobic interaction and gel filtration chromatography of extracts from cells stimulated with insulin. Both MAP kinase activity and the phosphoprotein were absent in fractions prepared from untreated cells. The 32P incorporated into the 40-kDa protein was stable during treatment with alkali. Phospho amino acid analysis confirmed that the radiolabel was primarily incorporated into phosphotyrosine and to a lesser extent phosphothreonine. In addition, MAP kinase was incompletely but specifically adsorbed by antibodies to phosphotyrosine. We conclude, based on these data and additional studies from this laboratory, that MAP kinase is phosphorylated on tyrosine in vivo. The data are consistent with the possibility that MAP kinase may be a substrate for the insulin receptor or another insulin-regulated tyrosine kinase.\r"

A 10.0-kilobase class of inserts was identified as carrying the ssb-1 gene itself.

Subcloning demonstrated that an intact mutant groEL gene was necessary for suppression and that plasmids carrying the 8.3-kilobase insert could suppress mutants carrying groES- but not groEL- genes for phage lambda growth. The suppressor, designated as groEL411, was specific for the ssb-1 allele. In ssb-1 groEL411 cells, DNA synthesis stopped after a shift to 42.5 degrees C but rapidly recovered within minutes. The data suggest a direct interaction between the single-stranded DNA-binding protein and GroEL proteins in DNA replication.\r"

Resting T cells (G0) stimulated with PHA responded with a generalized increase in protein synthesis that included HSP70. Gel blot analysis indicated that steady-state levels of HSP70 mRNA were not specifically modulated by PHA. Synthesis of HSP90 protein, however, peaked very rapidly following PHA stimulation and decreased sharply after 1 hr. When IL-2-dependent human T cells, synchronized by IL-2 deprivation, were treated with IL-2, synthesis of HSP70 mRNA was increased as much as 15-fold. HSP70 and HSP90 protein synthesis increased significantly upon IL-2 stimulation of human T lymphocytes. Two distinct members of the ancient family of heat shock genes, HSP70 and HSP90, are shown to be stimulated at the activation and progression stages of lymphocyte mitogenesis, which suggests that genetic mechanisms evolved from primitive stress/adaptation responses may be conserved in mammalian cellular activation.\r"

  ".W": "We have cloned the gene for the alpha-factor receptor of the yeast Saccharomyces kluyveri by using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae receptor gene (c-STE2) as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of the S. kluyveri gene (k-STE2) shows that its predicted polypeptide contains seven hydrophobic segments capable of spanning a lipid bilayer and thus that, like c-STE2, it appears to be a member of the rhodopsin/beta-adrenergic receptor family. The k-STE2 polypeptide is 50% identical to that coded by c-STE2, with high conservation (greater than 67%) in the putative membrane-spanning domains. The carboxyl-terminal amino acid sequences are not similar, but both are very hydrophilic and rich in serine and threonine residues. The k-STE2 gene is functional in S. cerevisiae: it reverses the mating defect of an S. cerevisiae mutant defective in its STE2 gene. S. cerevisiae strains expressing k-STE2 rather than c-STE2 exhibit the mating-factor selectivity characteristic of S. kluyveri: better response to S. kluyveri alpha factor than to S. cerevisiae alpha factor. (S. cerevisiae normally responds much better to its own alpha-factor peptide than to the related alpha-factor peptide of S. kluyveri.) This observation demonstrates that the STE2 gene is responsible for ligand selectivity and provides additional evidence that the STE2 protein is the receptor for alpha factor.\r"

Heterologous lysosomes were brought together by vesicular stomatitis virus-mediated cell fusion. The distribution of lysosomal membrane protein was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence using species-specific monoclonal antibody. LAMP-2, a mouse lysosomal membrane protein, and HLAMP-B, a human lysosomal membrane protein, were found to transfer to Chinese hamster ovary cell sucrosomes (sucrose-swollen lysosomes). This transfer occurred in the presence of cycloheximide. The exchange of LAMP-2 and LIMP I, a rat lysosomal membrane protein, was observed between native lysosomes in a mouse (3T3)-rat (normal rat kidney) cell fusion. Extensive transfer/exchange was observed within 1.5-2 hr postfusion, which is consistent with the kinetics of endocytic content exchange between lysosomes. Both membrane protein and content transfer between lysosomes were inhibited by nocodazole, a disrupter of microtubules, as was endocytic delivery to sucrose-swollen lysosomes. In the presence of nocodazole, tubular lysosomes disappeared. Both tubular lysosomes and microtubules may be important for the transfer/exchange. The interspecies cell fusion/monoclonal antibody approach developed here should be readily applicable to determining if membrane protein exchange is a property of other organelles such as Golgi apparatus and mitochondria.\r"

In purified beta cells, the sugar induces a 25-fold increase in the synthesis of insulin immunoreactive material over 60-min incubation. Autoradiographic analysis of the individual cells shows that this effect is achieved via dose-dependent recruitment of pancreatic beta cells to biosynthetic activity. Recruitment of beta cells is also seen in isolated islets exposed to glucose. The sigmoidal dose-response curve for glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis thus reflects a heterogeneous responsiveness of pancreatic beta cells rather than a progressively increasing activity of functionally homogeneous cells. Dose-dependent recruitment of functionally diverse cells may be a ubiquitous mechanism in tissue function.\r"

The appearance of class II antigen-associated LIP coincides with the disappearance of class II antigen-associated invariant (I) chain. Glycopeptides generated by in vitro proteolysis of LIP and I chain using Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease are identical as determined by electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. These results suggest that LIP is a proteolytic product derived from the I chain and are consistent with the view that further in vivo proteolysis of LIP by a leupeptin-sensitive enzyme normally facilitates its release from class II antigens. Incubation of B-LCL with monensin, which traps class II antigens and associated I chain in the Golgi apparatus, or chloroquine, which neutralizes intracellular acidic compartments and inhibits I-chain dissociation, blocks the leupeptin-induced appearance of LIP. Treatment of LIP with endoglycosidases F and H shows that both of its N-linked oligosaccharides are in the complex form, indicating that proteolysis of class II antigen-associated I chain to generate LIP occurs in a late-Golgi or post-Golgi compartment. The compartment in which these proteolytic events occur may be identical to the site in macrophages and B lymphocytes where foreign antigens are processed and interact with class II HLA molecules.\r"

In the present study, we show that sera from six AHP patients, but not from 26 patients with other autoimmune diseases or from 7 healthy subjects, react with bovine endothelial cells in culture (by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy) and in tissue sections (by immunohistology). We found uniformly that the immunoglobulin class reacting is IgM. Adsorption experiments showed that the antigenic determinants reacting with AHP sera were similar on bovine cultured endothelial cell membranes and in tissue sections of bovine parathyroid glands. The AHP sera also reacted with endothelial cells cultured from bovine adrenal medulla and pulmonary artery. Immunoblot analysis showed antibody binding to two major bands of 200 and 130 kDa solubilized from the membrane fraction of bovine parathyroid endothelial cells. Only one AHP serum consistently recognized endothelium-related structures on frozen sections of three different human parathyroid adenomas; two other sera reacted with one adenoma each; and three did not react with human adenomas. This indicates that human material is less suitable than bovine in detecting endothelium-related immune phenomena in AHP sera. The anti-endothelium IgM antibodies appear to be disease-specific but are not organ- or species-specific. The identification of endothelial cells as the target for antibodies in AHP raises the possibility that the endothelium subserves an important local function for endocrine epithelium.\r"

  ".W": "While neuronal mitosis is uniquely restricted to early development, the underlying regulation remains to be defined. We have now developed a dissociated, embryonic sympathetic neuron culture system that uses fully defined medium in which cells enter the mitotic cycle. The cultured cells expressed two neuronal traits, tyrosine hydroxylase [L-tyrosine, tetrahydropteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating); EC 1.14.16.2] and the neuron-specific 160-kDa neurofilament subunit protein, but were devoid of glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for non-myelin-forming Schwann cells in ganglia. Approximately one-third of the tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells synthesized DNA in culture, specifically incorporating [3H]thymidine into their nuclei. We used this system to define factors regulating the mitotic cycle in sympathetic neuroblasts. Members of the insulin family of growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factors I and II, regulated DNA synthesis in the presumptive neuroblasts. Insulin more than doubled the proportion of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells entering the mitotic cycle, as indicated by autoradiography of [3H]thymidine incorporation into nuclei. Scintillation spectrometry was an even more sensitive index of DNA synthesis, revealing a 4-fold insulin stimulation with an ED50 of 100 ng/ml. Insulin-like growth factor I was 100-fold more potent than insulin, whereas insulin-like growth factor II was less potent, suggesting that insulin growth factor type I receptors mediated the mitogenic responses. In contrast, the trophic protein nerve growth factor exhibited no mitogenic effect, suggesting that the mitogenic action of insulin growth factors is highly specific. Our observations are discussed in the context of the detection of insulin growth factors and receptors in the developing brain.\r"

  ".W": "The role of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel in glutamate neurotoxicity was investigated in cultured hippocampal neurons of the CA1 region. An equation, the survival function, was developed to quantify the effects of putative modulators of neurotoxicity. 2-Amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (30 microM) reduced the neuronal sensitivity to glutamate by a factor greater than 20, whereas glycine (1 microM) enhanced it by a factor of 7.5 +/- 2.5. Neurons were protected by increasing Mg2+ concentrations in a predictable way based on the ion's ability to block the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel. These findings provide a quantitative basis for the assessment of various neuroprotective agents and add further support to the hypothesis that the N-methyl-D-aspartate channel is central to glutamate neurotoxicity.\r"

CT should currently be considered the primary imaging modality in patients with acute neurologic deficits (stroke), acute onset of severe headaches, and when fine bone detail is required. Acutely injured patients are more readily studied with CT. The vast majority of patients in whom CT is preferred are seen in emergent situations, frequently in hospital emergency rooms. The effects of trauma beyond the acute stage are best evaluated with MR. In the future, MR is likely to become the procedure of choice in even more clinical situations than at present. A summary of currently recommended primary imaging modalities in various clinical situations is provided in Table 1.\r"

MR currently rivals other imaging modalities in this region. At present, it is often better in demonstrating the depth of tumor infiltration and the presence of nodal metastasis. Initial studies also suggest that MR can effectively image postoperative sites and discriminate chronic fibrosis from recurrent tumor. Localization of abnormal parathyroid glands, particularly for re-exploration, is a promising technique. If the present limitations are recognized, such as identification of soft tissue calcification, MR can play an important role in the evaluation of the face and neck. With additional investigation and continued technologic improvements it is likely that this role will continue to increase.\r"

Technical improvements in scanner performance have resulted in marked improvements in image quality in the upper abdomen and liver. In addition, increased experience has demonstrated that a number of lesions can be characterized on MRI through the use and analysis of signal intensity patterns and morphology. These include cavernous hemangiomas, cysts, focal nodular hyperplasia, encapsulated hepatomas, and hematomas in the liver. While the sensitivity of MR in the detection of focal liver disease is quite high and comparable to that of CT, deficiencies in the detection of the extrahepatic manifestations of malignant disease suggest that it is still not the primary screening modality. At present, MR appears to be a problem-solving modality in the evaluation of focal liver disease. It is useful in characterizing solitary lesions and defining the segmental extent of a detected abnormality, and as an adjunctive study when there is a discrepancy in the results of two imaging studies.\r"

  ".W": "We believe that the preponderance of evidence suggests that MRI is less accurate than conventional mammography in the diagnosis of primary cancer of the breast. Thus, it currently has no established place in algorithms for the evaluation of patients suspected of having breast cancer. MRI could be used to evaluate masses with mammographically smooth, well-defined margins, since high signal intensity (greater than fat) in a T2-weighted image is a highly specific indicator of benignancy in such lesions. However, most of these masses are cysts and can be reliably and less expensively identified as such by sonography. Nonetheless, MRI might be used to re-evaluate a smooth, well-defined mass if sonography has failed to identify the lesion as a cyst. MRI might be particularly useful in this regard if a lesion is difficult to evaluate by other modalities because it is located adjacent to the chest wall, is deep within a very large breast, or is obscured by a breast prosthesis. MRI with Gd-DTPA may be useful in evaluating radiographically dense breasts or in differentiating breast malignancies from irregular dysplastic or scar tissue. However, further investigation of this technique is needed. It has been hoped that in vivo measurement of T1 and T2 or in vivo NMR spectroscopy might improve the accuracy of noninvasive diagnosis of cancer of the breast. However, there is currently no credible evidence that in vivo measurements of relaxation times provide useful indexes for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In vivo NMR spectroscopy of nuclei other than P may ultimately provide reliable criteria for noninvasive diagnosis of breast cancer in humans, but the technique is currently in its infancy.\r"

Currently, PA may be difficult to differentiate from prostatitis and other diseases of the lower urogenital tract. Prostatic enlargement is found in 75% of cases, whereas fever and urinary retention each occur in only one-third of cases. The organisms most frequently isolated from PA are Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacilli; other isolates include Staphylococcus species and an expanding spectrum of bacteria and fungi. PA due to Staphylococcus species may also occur in neonates. Transrectal ultrasonography and computerized tomography are valuable methods for the preoperative diagnosis of PA. Although transurethral resection of the prostate is the most commonly used therapy for PA, transperineal aspiration of pus guided by transrectal ultrasonography appears to be promising.\r"

Plesiomonads have been associated with extraintestinal diseases (bacteremia, meningitis) on rare occasions; they have been recovered sporadically from patients presenting with acute gastroenteritis. Although case reports and epidemiologic data support a role for P. shigelloides in diarrheal disease, laboratory investigations have failed to identify an enteropathogenic mechanism in these bacteria consistently or to reveal an animal model that faithfully reproduces the disease. Moreover, studies with volunteers have failed to establish an etiologic relation between Plesiomonas and bacterial gastroenteritis.

Comparison with other unusual gram-positive rods causing endocarditis shows that E. rhusiopathiae resembles Listeria monocytogenes and Lactobacillus species in its propensity to involve structurally damaged but native left-sided valves. Unlike diphtheroid endocarditis, E. rhusiopathiae endocarditis has not involved prosthetic valves and is not associated with intravenous drug abuse, as is Bacillus species endocarditis. E. rhusiopathiae is exquisitely susceptible to penicillin but resistant to vancomycin. Since vancomycin is often employed in empiric therapy for presumed endocarditis, prompt microbiologic differentiation of E. rhusiopathiae from other gram-positive organisms is necessary to avoid delays in the initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Haemophilus parainfluenzae, although a human commensal, is infrequently reported to be pathogenic. A child with a hepatic abscess caused by this organism was studied, and 54 other significant pediatric infections associated with H. parainfluenzae, as reported in the English-language literature, were reviewed. Meningitis and endocarditis were the most frequently reported infections and affected dissimilar populations of patients. Localized abscesses of the brain, skin, joints, and liver also occurred. Risk factors and antecedent illnesses were occasionally identified. The overall mortality rate was 11%, and the combined rates of morbidity and mortality totaled 38%. Difficulty in identifying H. parainfluenzae may have resulted in misdiagnosis of infections caused by this organism in the past. Antibiotic-resistant strains have emerged. Because H. parainfluenzae is ubiquitous and can cause serious disease in otherwise normal patients, it should be considered a pathogen, and its potential for causing pediatric illness should be more fully appreciated.\r"

Seven patients seen at one hospital over a 5-year period illustrate the clinical presentations of such infections. The infections identified in these seven patients include endocarditis, meningitis, nontraumatic gas gangrene, empyema, hepatic abscesses, retroperitoneal abscess, clostridial sepsis, and colovesical fistulae with urosepsis. A computer-assisted search of the English-language literature and cross-checks from other review articles identified other infections associated with colon cancer, which include nontraumatic crepitant cellulitis, suppurative thyroiditis, pericarditis, appendicitis, pulmonary microabscesses, septic arthritis, and fever of unknown origin. The clinical importance of these infections and their correlation with colorectal malignancies are reviewed.\r"

  ".W": "The performance of lumbar puncture (LP) in patients with suspected meningitis is often delayed if, for example, the clinical presentation suggests a need for prior computed tomographic (CT) scan or if patients are initially examined at settings with limited clinical facilities. The role of empiric parenteral antibiotic therapy prior to LP under these circumstances has not been critically analyzed. Review of the literature suggests that in cases of bacterial meningitis (1) the existing data are inadequate to assess the effect of a short delay of therapy on mortality and morbidity; (2) a short period of antibiotic therapy prior to LP does not change cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count, protein, or glucose; (3) the yield of CSF gram stain and culture may be somewhat reduced by a short period of antibiotic therapy, but these tests often remain positive; and (4) adjunctive tests, including blood cultures and CSF antigen tests, can often independently identify the bacterial meningopathogen. The available evidence suggests that if bacterial meningitis is suspected and LP must be delayed, intravenous antibiotics are warranted before CSF is obtained.\r"

The first two sections of this review focus primarily on the normal development and function of the cells of the immune system and the known abnormalities that occur in this system in AIDS patients. Very little is known of the pathogenesis, in humans, of the four major clinical manifestations of AIDS--immunodeficiency, encephalopathy, Kaposi's sarcoma, and lymphoma. Because most pathologic studies derive from autopsy findings in terminal AIDS patients, it has been difficult to track the course of HIV infection from the time of initial contact with the virus through the evolution of the disease. Therefore, the final section of this review focuses on actual and potential animal models of AIDS and how such models might be valuable for studies on the pathogenesis of the disease, the development of relevant vaccines, and the testing of potential therapies.\r"

Numerous other retroviruses are also cytopathic. Studies of these other retroviruses are reviewed in this article.

Literature reports on seven additional cases of suppurative parotitis due to anaerobic bacteria are reviewed.

  ".U": "88235617\r", 
  ".W": "Most hospital studies of measles mortality suggest that high case fatality ratios are associated with malnutrition. However, no community study has documented this association. On the contrary, several community studies from Africa and Asia have found no relation between nutritional status and risk of severe or fatal measles. Instead, overcrowding and intensive exposure may be more important determinants of measles mortality. Clustering of several cases in the family and/or intensive exposure were associated with high measles mortality in community studies in West Africa, Bangladesh, and England. Thus sociocultural factors that concentrate many susceptible children in the home may increase the case-fatality ratio in measles. Conversely, this ratio will be lower when measles cases are dispersed. Siblings in rural areas, where long intervals separate epidemics, run a higher risk of contracting measles simultaneously than do their urban counterparts. Measles vaccination increases herd immunity and diminishes the clustering of several cases in a family. Vaccination may therefore reduce mortality even among unvaccinated children who contract measles. Crowding and intensive exposure may partly explain regional and historical variations in measles mortality; community studies suggest that mortality is high when a high proportion of measles patients have secondary cases (acquired through exposure at home).\r"

For them, analysis in terms of the \"relative operating characteristic\" of signal detection theory provides a precise and valid measure of diagnostic accuracy. It is the only measure available that is uninfluenced by decision biases and prior probabilities, and it places the performances of diverse systems on a common, easily interpreted scale. Representative values of this measure are reported here for systems in medical imaging, materials testing, weather forecasting, information retrieval, polygraph lie detection, and aptitude testing. Though the measure itself is sound, the values obtained from tests of diagnostic systems often require qualification because the test data on which they are based are of unsure quality. A common set of problems in testing is faced in all fields. How well these problems are handled, or can be handled in a given field, determines the degree of confidence that can be placed in a measured value of accuracy. Some fields fare much better than others.\r"

Kinetic peculiarities of DNA damage production by hydrogen peroxide in vivo can be reproduced by including DNA in an in vitro Fenton reaction system in which iron catalyzes the univalent reduction of hydrogen peroxide by the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). To minimize the toxicity of oxygen radicals, the cell utilizes scavengers of these radicals and DNA repair enzymes. On the basis of observations with the model system, it is proposed that the cell may also decrease such toxicity by diminishing available NAD(P)H and by utilizing oxygen itself to scavenge active free radicals into superoxide, which is then destroyed by superoxide dismutase.\r"

A candidate structure for the HIV-1 binding site on the CD4 protein was identified by epitope mapping with a family of eight functionally distinct CD4-specific monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with a panel of large CD4-derived synthetic peptides. All of the seven epitopes that were located reside within two immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops situated between residues 1 and 168 of the CD4 protein. The CD4-specific monoclonal antibody OKT4A, a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 binding, recognized a site between residues 32 and 47 on the CD4 protein. By analogy to other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins, this particular region has been predicted to exist as a protruding loop. A synthetic analog of this loop (residues 25 to 58) showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of HIV-1-induced cell fusion. It is proposed that a loop extending from residues 37 to 53 of the CD4 protein is a binding site for the AIDS virus.\r"

(i) The virus life cycle includes several events--in particular, reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into DNA, orderly integration of viral DNA into host chromosomes, and utilization of host mechanisms for gene expression in response to viral signals--which are broadly informative about eukaryotic cells and viruses. (ii) Retroviral oncogenesis usually depends on transduction or insertional activation of cellular genes, and isolation of those genes has provided the scientific community with many of the molecular components now implicated in the control of normal growth and in human cancer. (iii) Retroviruses include many important veterinary pathogens and two recently discovered human pathogens, the causative agents of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma. (iv) Retroviruses are genetic vectors in nature and can be modified to serve as genetic vectors for both experimental and therapeutic purposes. (v) Insertion of retroviral DNA into host chromosomes can be used to mark cell lineages and to make developmental mutants. Progress in these and other areas of retrovirus-related biology has been enormous during the past two decades, but many practical and theoretical problems remain to be solved.\r"

Similarly, the study in bacteria of the transactions of DNA, of the synthesis and function of the cell membrane, of differentiation, and of the interaction with eukaryotic cells will undoubtedly produce results of general importance. The advantages of using bacteria for these studies include their simple noncompartmented structure, the accessibility of their genetic material, and the possibility of correlating the expression of a gene in the intact cell with its expression in a system composed of highly purified components. Finally, the comparative study of a wide variety of microorganisms may result in a better understanding of the evolution of prokaryotes and eukaryotes and lead to a comprehensive theory of cell biology.\r"

  ".W": "There are compelling reasons for choosing to develop the human as the highest-order experimental system in genetics: an obvious social context that stirs interest, wide medical observation of the population that permits identification of an abundance of genetic defects, and our ability to perceive in the human subtle or complex variations that may not be observable in other species. Various lines of genetic inquiry that are based on research in other systems--cytogenetic analysis, biochemical studies, mapping of defective loci by linkage analysis in affected families, and in vitro techniques such as the creation of transgenic organisms--complement and enrich each other. New phenomena that would not have been predicted from investigations in other organisms have been found in humans, such as the discovery of the \"giant\" Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene and the identification of recessive cancer genes. Genetic research is yielding insights into human biology that are raising new possibilities for therapy and prevention of disease, as well as challenges to society in the form of ethical decisions about the appropriate application of genetic information.\r"

We have derived several guidelines from our experience with one such case and from a review of the 36 cases reported in the literature over the last decade. Diagnosis must be established before exsanguination occurs. Bronchoscopy and angiography are often nondiagnostic. Control of hemorrhage and a patent airway are the initial goals of treatment. Interruption of the innominate artery is the definitive treatment, with a low rebleeding rate (7%, 1/14 cases) and good long-term survival (64%, 9/14 cases). Maintenance of continuity of the innominate artery is contraindicated, because of a high rebleeding rate (60%, 6/10 cases) and poor long-term survival (10%, 1/10 cases). There is no convincing evidence that interruption of the innominate artery causes significant neurologic or vascular compromise.\r"

After aseptic skin preparation, the interface between the keloid and normal skin or subcutaneous tissue was injected with betamethasone sodium phosphate and betamethasone acetate suspension (Celestone Soluspan). The lesion was excised, and the defect was closed with subcutaneous polyglycolic acid suture. No further therapy was given.

Because they have potent anti-inflammatory properties, facilitate beta-adrenergic responsiveness, suppress the late-phase reaction and reduce secretion of mucus, GCS are indicated in the treatment of severe acute asthma and chronic asthma not responsive to beta-agonists and methylxanthines. They are also useful as a diagnostic tool to determine reversibility of airway obstruction in some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Maximal antiasthmatic effect is achieved by prescribing daily divided doses of intermediate-acting systemic GCS and reducing the dosage to alternate days after the asthma has been controlled. Inhaled GCS have minimal systemic effects when used properly, and in selected cases may be as effective as the oral preparations. Improper use of these drugs may provoke side effects which are undesirable and dangerous. Proper patient education in the use of these drugs is necessary to avoid such severe adverse effects.\r"

Patients with emphysema or septic pulmonary disease who have adequate or recoverable cardiac function can be well served by double-lung transplantation. However, such patients are still treated in some centers by combined heart-lung transplantation. Patients with right-heart failure secondary to vascular or parenchymal pulmonary disease are best managed by combined heart-lung transplantation. Donor availability, airway healing, and diagnosis of rejection remain significant problems and are the focus of experimental and clinical investigation in many centers.\r"

  ".W": "There is no doubt that currently available biventricular pneumatic pulsatile devices placed orthotopically with transcutaneous drive lines can support life in patients who may then be successfully transplanted. For the most part, the world experience is with the Jarvik hearts. The current model of choice is the 70-cc device because it is smaller and may be implanted with less fear of \"fit problems\" than the 100-cc model. As Case 4 illustrates, a fit problem may cause a fatal outcome. But if special precautions in implantation are taken, these may be avoided (Case 6). The fears of excessive bleeding, hemolysis, embolism, and infection with the use of these devices are not as prohibitive as we suspected. Bleeding is always a threat in complex cardiac surgery with grafting. Hemolysis is not a problem if excessive transfusion can be avoided. Embolism and infection may be inevitable, but as our patient B.C. has proven, there is no need to rush immediately to transplantation. And if the implanted patient does not meet local transplant selection criteria, we have enough information now to recommend that they not be accepted for transplantation. Bleeding may be anticipated to be a major problem in any patient with dense reactive scar tissue. To avoid this, transplantation should be done within 3 weeks. We recommend patients who have previously been selected for orthotopic transplantation and begin an accelerated decompensation (our Cases 2 and 7) as the best candidates for temporary orthotopic mechanical support. In these patients, there is no question about whether recovery of the native heart is possible or whether a reversible myocardial insult is present. The plan to do an orthotopic transplant indicates that a cardiectomy is necessary. Case 5, who was in reasonable shape for transplantation, was also favorable. In cases of anticipated graft failure, early use of the Jarvik 7-70 is recommended. This type of device, when suitably placed, provides excellent control of the circulation. There is no requirement for intensive care of the native heart, since it is gone, along with toxic antiarrhythmic medications, risk of embolizing a mural thrombus, and the constant balancing of a univentricular device vis-a-vis the native heart. Further, if pulmonary edema is present with accompanying elevation in pulmonary vascular resistance, the biventricular device requires only an upward adjustment in right drive pressure. With a univentricular device one must worry not only about the pulmonary vascular resistance but also about the capacity of the right heart to pump at a normal output.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

In another 11 instances of primary tumors of the liver in patients with cirrhosis who underwent laparotomy, findings from intraoperative ultrasonography advised against exeretic operation because other intrahepatic lesions or neoplastic thrombi in portal branches were detected. The operative mortality rate in the 31 patients who underwent resection of the liver was 12.9 per cent. The actuarial three year survival rate is 58 per cent.

In this communication, we report the results of 19 hepatic transplants done for 17 patients suffering from Budd-Chiari syndrome. The first patient who had a transplant did not receive anticoagulant therapy during the postoperative period, and recurrent thrombosis of the hepatic veins in the newly transplanted liver rapidly developed. Sixteen patients who subsequently underwent transplantation were managed using a philosophy of early postoperative anticoagulant treatment when feasible. Using this approach, the cumulative proportion of patients surviving at one and three years was 88 per cent, and no recurrent hepatic vein thrombosis occurred during a mean follow-up period of 28.2 months. Forty-four per cent of the patients who were deliberately given anticoagulant medication experienced a hemorrhagic complication in the postoperative period, but there were no associated deaths. In spite of anticoagulant therapy, 31 per cent of the patients on anticoagulantion medication experienced a thrombotic complication that did not involve the hepatic veins; one early and one late death resulted, and a third patient required urgent retransplantation. Despite the difficulties in patient management, a carefully selected population of patients with hepatic failure secondary to Budd-Chiari syndrome appear to be well served by hepatic transplantation with early postoperative and long term anticoagulant therapy.\r"

Knots were either buried subcutaneously or left outside. Monofilament sutures, with buried knots, cut through and became completely incorporated as the plicated normal tissue flattened out to a normal appearance in about three weeks. Silk sutures and bulky outside knots left suppurating sinuses. Histologic examination at seven weeks confirmed the incorporated nylon or Prolene mattress sutures were surrounded by a sheath of clean scar tissue trailing as a curtain back to the cut through skin. It is concluded that sutures of monofilament nylon or Prolene, with buried knots, can be tied under tension to include outside skin and will cut through cleanly to become incorporated without sinus or suppuration. Such incorporated sutures and their trailing curtains of clean scar tissue can provide an internal buttress against soft tissue displacement with potential clinical application.\r"

According to the extent of reverse flow in the saphenous trunks, varicosities of the long saphenous vein were classified into five types and the short saphenous vein, into four types. Two hundred five (66.3%) of 309 limbs with varicosities of the long saphenous vein had reverse flow in the entire saphenous trunk from the groin to the ankle. In varicosities of the short saphenous vein, 37 (52.9%) of 70 limbs showed reverse flow from the popliteal fossa to the ankle. The other limbs demonstrated reverse flow only in some segments of the saphenous veins. On the basis of these Doppler ultrasonic findings, selective stripping operations were performed on 80 limbs, in which only the segments with venous reverse flow were selectively removed. Postoperative plethysmographic measurement of the venous reflux volume and follow-up studies showed that results of the selective stripping operations were as satisfactory as those of the standard stripping operations (189 limbs) in which the entire saphenous vein was removed. Furthermore, the selective stripping operation was advantageous in reducing the incidence of nerve injury.\r"

  ".U": "88236259\r", 
  ".W": "We examined how a combination of pharmacologic agents (\"rescue\" agents) affect the function of hypothermically preserved dog kidneys at the time of reperfusion. Dog kidneys were preserved either by simple cold storage in EuroCollins' solution for 24 or 48 hours or by continuous perfusion at 5 degrees C in Belzer's gluconate-hydroxyethyl starch solution for as long as 5 days. After preservation, renal functions were measured with the isolated perfused kidney model. Kidneys were reperfused at normothermia either with or without the addition of a combination of rescue agents to the reperfusion medium. The rescue agents studied were allopurinol (1 mmol/L); superoxide dismutase (32,000 U/L); catalase (137,500 U/L); dimethylthiourea (3 mmol/L); glutathione (3 mmol/L); desferrioxamine (0.2 gm/L), for protection against O2 free radical injury and lipid peroxidation injury; verapamil (25 mg/L), as a Ca channel blocker; and ATP-MgCl2 (0.3 mmol/L), to stimulate energy metabolism. The renal functions we measured were glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (creatinine clearance), urine production, perfusate flow, urinary protein concentration, Na reabsorptive capacity, and tissue concentrations of ATP, K, and total tissue water. GFR was reduced by 75% to 90% after all periods of preservation, and the rescue agents had no effect on GFR. Sodium reabsorption was reduced from 98% to a range of 40% to 50% after 48 hours of cold storage or 5 days of machine perfusion and was not increased by rescue agents. There was a time-dependent increase in the amount of urine protein that was not affected by rescue agents. The addition of rescue agents did not affect total tissue water or concentrations of ATP or K in kidneys after normothermic reperfusion. These results demonstrate that pharmacologic agents previously suggested to suppress reperfusion damage in kidneys are not effective in this model. Therefore it is likely that kidneys damage occurs primarily during preservation, which suggest that optimal function on reperfusion calls for the development of better methods of preservation.\r"

Our investigation was carried out in a group of 16 patients with severe carotid stenosis or occlusion and in a control group of 42 patients with no or stenosis of less than 50% local diameter reduction. After onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, both groups showed a short unstable phase followed by increased blood flow velocity (10% increase ipsilateral to the obstruction, 27% increase in the control group). Just before rewarming, blood flow velocity was still comparable to (control group -3%) or higher than (ipsilateral to obstructions +14%) prebypass values. Analysis of three patients with postoperative diffuse encephalopathy did not reveal reduced blood flow during cardiopulmonary bypass as a relevant factor. Two of the three showed luxury perfusion. Reduced perfusion due to carotid obstruction was not observed during cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore cannot be considered a significant risk factor for the development of intraoperative stroke.\r"

In this model of right hemisphere multifocal ischemia, cortical somatosensory evoked response (CSER) amplitude, 14C autoradiographic blood flow, and 111In-labeled platelet accumulation were measured. The ratio of injured to noninjured hemispheric 111In activity (cpm/g) provided an index of platelet accumulation. Treatment improved CBF of the injured hemisphere compared with control after 4 hours of reperfusion (74 +/- 17 versus 53 +/- 13 ml/100 g/min, p less than 0.05), and it enhanced recovery of CSER amplitude (percent of baseline) after 1 hour of reperfusion compared with control (27.1 +/- 4.7% [treatment] versus 15.5 +/- 2.8% [control], p less than 0.05). However, the effect on CSER was not sustained after 4 hours of recovery. Despite these effects on CSER and CBF, treatment failed to inhibit 111In-labeled platelet accumulation in the injured hemisphere (1.7 +/- 0.3% [treatment] versus 1.5 +/- 0.1% [control], p greater than 0.05). Platelets may adhere to damaged endothelium despite aggressive platelet antiaggregant therapy.\r"

Twelve patients suffering from neurologic deficits due to acute ischemic stroke were examined by four investigators, and the results were assessed using the Mathew scale. Considerable interobserver variability was found. Agreement on items based on subjective information from the patient was low, and it is also possible that this information changes with time. It is advised that in the development of assessment scales, items with low interobserver agreement should be avoided.\r"

Study medication was administered intravenously continuously (16 mg/kg/day, maximum 1,200 mg/day) for 3 days and per os (400 mg t.i.d.) for the remainder of 28 days. Demographic data were comparable, and functional impairment and mortality (pentoxifylline 12%, placebo 10%) were not different between the two groups. Neurologic deficit scores improved from baseline admission scores during the 4-week study in both groups but did not differ between groups at admission or throughout the study except during the first few days when the consciousness level (Days 1 and 2), motor function (Days 1 and 2), cranial nerve function (Days 1-4), and total neurologic deficit scores (Days 1 and 2) were better in the pentoxifylline group than in the placebo group, especially in a subset of patients with severe deficits at admission. Laboratory values and side effects were also comparable between groups. Our study indicates that pentoxifylline can be given safely in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Although pharmacologic effects were present during the first few days, the clinical benefits were small and not sustained.\r"

These cases, and others in the literature, illustrate that in certain settings severe urinary tract obstruction may be present in the absence of dilatation and hence may be missed by noninvasive imaging techniques. Nondilated obstructive uropathy should be suspected in any elderly patient who presents with the acute onset of oliguria in the absence of an identifiable cause, especially if there is a previous history of malignancy in the pelvis. Left undiagnosed, this potentially reversible cause of renal failure can lead to end-stage renal disease.\r"

Rarely should intravenous urography, antegrade pyelography, or cystoscopy and retrograde pyelography be necessary. Findings of high-grade obstruction and/or significantly diminished function on the affected side(s) should prompt early neonatal reconstruction. Pyeloplasty was performed within the first month of life in 17 infants (20 kidneys) diagnosed as having significant ureteropelvic junction obstruction. Early reconstruction in the neonatal period can be performed successfully with minimal complications and a relatively brief period of hospitalization. This may ultimately achieve maximal preservation of renal function.\r"

While this drug is effective against the Gram-negative enteric bacilli usually encountered in intra-abdominal infections, it is not practical as a single agent since anaerobic bacteria are not susceptible to aztreonam. The use of aztreonam avoids the nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity associated with aminoglycoside antibiotics. Its pharmacokinetic parameters allow administration 3 or 4 times daily, and it is less expensive than many alternative agents. Studies comparing aztreonam to tobramycin in patients who also received clindamycin for acute appendicitis note similar rates of success in both antibiotic treatment groups.\r"

Most antibiotic regimens used to treat these pulmonary infections include aminoglycoside antibiotics. Since achievable serum and tissue levels of aminoglycosides are limited by dose-related nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity, alternative forms of antibiotic therapy would be desirable. Aztreonam, the first clinically available monobactam antibiotic, achieves high serum levels and adequate levels in bronchial secretions and lung parenchyma for efficacy against most Gram-negative pathogens implicated in nosocomial pneumonias. The results of early clinical trials comparing aztreonam with aminoglycosides for treatment of Gram-negative bacterial pneumonias indicate that this monobactam antibiotic is a safe, effective alternative to aminoglycoside therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Bacterial colonization is the necessary first step in the etiology of all urinary tract infections. The hospital setting provides a pool of pathogenic bacteria which may lead to colonization in the hospitalized patient. The nosocomial infections which may follow and require treatment most often follow catheterization. Some host factors often lead to persistence of colonization and invasive symptomatic disease. These might include stone, caliceal diverticula, a hydronephrotic kidney, vesicoureteral reflux, bladder neck obstruction with residual urine, urethral diverticula, and infection of the prostate, as well as other disease states such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, or drug immunosuppression. Bacterial virulence must also be considered, but since normal host barriers are broken down by catheterization or instrumentation, usually avirulent bacteria are the more common cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections. Increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotics has been recognized among nosocomial infections. Thus, for a stringent trial, any new drug should be used to treat infections due to bacteria with multiple antibiotic resistance. The antibiotic must be active against the organisms, and early follow-up should evaluate both microbiologic and symptomatic cure. Late follow-up should show that there is no persistence of the original organism. New antibiotics should show some advantage over present antibiotics being used for treatment. Aztreonam offers an advantage over aminoglycosides in that it is neither ototoxic nor nephrotoxic. It appears to cause less antibiotic resistance in bacteria colonizing the intestine and therefore holds an advantage over most of the beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, aztreonam does not appear to be haptogenic and has shown little cross-allergenicity to either penicillins or cephalosporins. Worldwide trials of the drug suggest that aztreonam is as efficient, if not more so, than the third-generation cephalosporins, newer penicillin derivatives, and the aminoglycosides in the treatment of Pseudomonas and other bacteria causing nosocomial urinary tract infections.\r"

Due to its specific spectrum of activity, aztreonam does not disturb the normal Gram-positive and anaerobic intestinal flora.

The latter was openly prescribed the combination of clofibrate and nicotinic acid for serum lipid lowering. Each patient should remain in the study for 5 years and be seen regularly every 4 months at a special IHD outpatient clinic within the hospital. The concentration of serum cholesterol and triglyceride was lowered by 13% and 19%, respectively, in the Treatment group compared to the Control group. Total mortality was 82 cases in the Control group and 61 in the Treatment group, a 26% reduction (p less than 0.05). For patients above 60 years of age in the Treatment group the reduction in mortality was 28% (p less than 0.05). IHD mortality was reduced by 36% (p less than 0.01) in the Treatment group compared to the Control group. The beneficial effect of the serum lipid lowering treatment was related to the serum triglyceride concentration in two ways. First, it only occurred in patients with a triglyceride level greater than 1.5 mmol/l (n = 216). Secondly, it was most pronounced in the 44% of the treated patients who had a lowering of the serum triglyceride by 30% or more, and in this subgroup the reduction of IHD mortality was 60% (p less than 0.01). For serum cholesterol there were no such relations. The difference between serum triglycerides and cholesterol concerning these relations to the treatment outcome may be due to the fact that hypertriglyceridaemia was the most common hyperlipidaemia among our patients, occurring in 50%, while hypercholesterolaemia only occurred in 13%. Caution should be exercised in the interpretation of the results as the trial was not blind. However, the fact that the decrease in IHD deaths was directly related to the degree of serum triglyceride lowering indicates that it was the drug effect on serum lipids that was responsible for the beneficial effect of the treatment.\r"

Forty patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomized to the double-blind therapy with metoprolol 200 mg daily or matching placebo. Therapy was started as soon as possible after admission to hospital and continued for 15 days. After this initial period all patients were treated with beta-blockade during the subsequent 6 months. Repeated investigations of heart rate responses to facial immersion in ice-cooled water and 24-hour ECG-recordings were performed on day 15 (while patients were on study therapy), after 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. Throughout the 6-month period, facial immersion elicited significant heart rate reductions in both treatment groups. No differences were found between the two groups or between different examinations during follow-up. There was no correlation between heart rate response to facial immersion and frequency of ventricular arrhythmia on a 24-hour monitoring. In conclusion, acute administration of metoprolol in myocardial infarction does not influence the bradycardial response to facial immersion either in the early postinfarction phase or during 6 months' follow-up. There is no relation between bradycardial response to face immersion and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma concentrations of 5,000 daltons (5 kDa) immunoreactive gastric inhibitory polypeptide (IR-GIP) were measured before and up to 16 hours after the start of low-dose insulin treatment in newly diagnosed ketotic type I (insulin-dependent) diabetics. Nine patients were non-fasting. Before insulin treatment mean IR-GIP was 31 +/- 6 pmol/l (range 9-65 pmol/l). Four patients had IR-GIP concentrations in the normal fasting range (10-25 pmol/l), and nine patients had concentrations below 35 pmol/l. The remaining patients had IR-GIP concentrations in the normal postprandial range. A meal eaten after the start of insulin treatment caused an increase in IR-GIP in all patients. All patients had beta-cell function as estimated by plasma C-peptide. Individual changes in C-peptide were significantly correlated to changes in blood glucose both after the meal (r = 0.80, p less than 0.01) and during insulin treatment (r = 0.85 +/- 0.04). No correlation could be found between IR-GIP and blood glucose, C-peptide or insulin concentrations. Newly diagnosed ketotic type I diabetics have IR-GIP concentrations within the normal postprandial level. Hypoinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, and hyperketonaemia do not by themselves increase 5 kDa IR-GIP markedly above normal fasting levels.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical and bacteriological effects of 1 and 3 weeks' pivampicillin plus pivmecillinam treatment were compared in a double-blind, randomized study of patients with acute pyelonephritis. Three weeks after the end of active treatment, clinical success was seen in 29 (91%) of the 32 patients on 1-week treatment, compared with 28 (97%) of the 29 patients treated for 3 weeks. Bacteriological success was seen in only nine (28%) patients in the 1-week group vs. 20 (69%) in the 3-week group (p = 0.004). This difference was mainly due to a large number of relapses of lower urinary tract infection in the 1-week group. Even in uncomplicated cases, the bacteriological result of the 1-week treatment was unsatisfactory. Side-effects were more common in the 3-week treatment group. In conclusion, 1-week treatment of patients with acute pyelonephritis is too short. Three weeks' treatment is effective in uncomplicated cases, but even longer treatment or low-dose prophylaxis is indicated in certain patients with predisposing factors.\r"

  ".W": "Abnormalities of the Achilles tendon and adjacent bursae are common problems that may be difficult to diagnose clinically. Twenty patients with symptoms involving the Achilles tendon and 10 control subjects were evaluated with real-time sonography in order to explore the role of sonography in defining abnormalities of the tendon and adjacent bursae and in differentiating between conditions requiring surgery and those needing conservative therapy. Normal anatomic structures seen consistently included the Achilles tendon, the musculotendinous junction, the retrocalcaneal bursa, and the calcaneal tendon insertion site. The normal range of tendon thickness was 4-9 mm (mean, 6.2 mm). All patients had repeat sonograms after either clinical resolution (14 cases) or surgical intervention (six cases). Twelve of the symptomatic patients had abnormal findings. Partial ruptures of the Achilles tendon were reliably differentiated from other lesions. No evidence of tendon thickening was found in tendinitis. Tendon thickening was found only in cases of previous tendon rupture. The superficial tendo Achillis bursa was imaged only when inflamed. Sonography was found to differentiate reliably between conditions that require surgical intervention and those that will respond to conservative therapy.\r"

  ".W": "Traditionally, sonographically guided percutaneous needle biopsy has been used for the biopsy of large, superficial, and cystic masses. Today, however, many think that small, solid masses also can be biopsied accurately. Real-time sonographically guided biopsies of 126 consecutive solid masses that were less than or equal to 3.0-cm in diameter (less than or equal to 1.0 cm, 24; 1.1-2.0 cm, 42; 2.1-3.0 cm, 60) were performed to diagnose primary or secondary neoplasm. These masses were located in a variety of anatomic regions (abdomen, 92; neck, 31; breast, two; extremity, one). Clear visualization of the biopsy needle was accomplished by continuous real-time monitoring of the needle's position, primarily by using linear, phased-array transducers, large-caliber needles (18- to 19-gauge, when possible), and an echogenic screw stylet inserted coaxially within the biopsy needle. The correct cytologic/histologic diagnosis was established in 91% of the masses (less than or equal to 1.0 cm, 79%; 1.1-2.0 cm, 88%; 2.1-3.0 cm, 98%). No complications other than mild, localized discomfort were encountered. Our experience suggests that sonographically guided biopsy is a highly accurate and safe procedure that can be used to establish the diagnosis in solid masses that are 3.0 cm or less in diameter if proper techniques are used to clearly visualize the biopsy needle.\r"
