  ".W": "Rowing is a strenuous sport that has a significant injury rate among competitive participants. Consequently, older individuals who are anticipating beginning recreational rowing should start with a thorough physical examination by their physician. Because the back and knees are the most frequently injured areas, an orthopedic assessment of these regions is indicated in those individuals who have had previous patellofemoral or low back pain. All prospective rowers should begin with a general conditioning program that addresses lower extremity and abdominal strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic conditioning. A thorough understanding of the proper mechanics of rowing is essential to avoid potential injury. Rowing is a satisfying sport that offers excellent physical exercise and cardiovascular benefits. Older individuals should be encouraged to row, but also should be aware of the variety of injuries this sport may produce.\r"

A great many of them play better, too. This additional play and skill can be highly satisfying to the participants; however, it puts them at risk for a number of overuse syndromes directly caused by the motion requirements of golf. In addition, the repetitive nature of the activity can exacerbate pre-existing and age-related orthopedic pathology as well. There is no substitute for attention to the preplay aspects of golf (warm-up, flexibility, and strengthening).\r"

It provides a freedom that is attractive to individuals of any age, either sex, and any body type. It does not require specialized experience or coordination. In the older athlete, injuries result primarily from overuse or abuse, and are most common in the upper extremity. Such injuries are most often compressive and inflammatory syndromes. These injuries are in marked contrast to those seen in the younger cyclist. Both groups have a low and similar incidence of accident. Overuse injuries can be treated effectively by altering training technique, correcting rider malposition, and decreasing excessive stress, in conjunction with appropriate medical management. Prevention of injury (particularly overuse) is the key to avoiding recurrence. Appropriate frame size, rider position, personalized training techniques, and clothing are essential in the older athlete in whom change is poorly tolerated. Fitness is preserved by regular cycling, possibly by the slowing of the degenerative process, while relieving mental stress and providing \"fun sport.\"\r"

Injuries to the elite collegiate competitive swimmers have been well-documented. Considerations and injuries to the masters-level swimmer closely mirror those found in the younger athlete, but these injuries reflect the impact of tissue aging (degenerative disease). The preparticipation history and physical examination become more important. We are hopeful that this article will contribute to greater safety and enjoyment among all older swimmers.\r"

  ".W": "The number of people participating in athletics does not equal the number of people with arthritis. There are no data to support the concern that athletic participation will make the onset of arthritic joints more likely. What is clear is that injuries that occur with athletics can increase the incidence of arthritis. If a patient does develop arthritis secondary to athletics, the treatment is not different than that offered for a spontaneously occurring arthritic joint. If an operation is necessary, the best operation depends a good deal on the goals of the patient. Continued athletic participation may be reasonable as long as the athletic activity is not vigorous and does not involve running and jumping or contact. The recommended athletic activities for patients with arthritis and for those having operations for arthritis are swimming, hiking, bicycling, walking, and golfing. The operations recommended for arthritic patients under the age of 30 should be biologic operations such as fusion or osteotomy. In patients aged 30 to 45, the operation should be correlated to lifestyle and desired level of activity. A biologic operation is better for highly active patients. When patients reach the age of 45 or are older, total joint replacement usually is preferable because of the improved clinical functional results and the decreased stress on surrounding joints with arthroplasty. If patients are older than 60 years, total joint replacement is the operation of choice and usually will include a cemented prosthesis. Some surgeons at this time do prefer cementless total-joint replacement for all patients regardless of age. Patients who have arthritis can have a satisfying athletic and exercise routine if they simply apply common sense to the manner in which they conduct their activities.\r"

  ".W": "Surgery consists of spinal decompression for predominately leg pain problems. The most commonly performed surgery in older patients is the lumbar laminectomy. Total laminectomy is the procedure recommended for central canal stenosis. More commonly, central canal, lateral recess, and foraminal stenosis occur in the same patient. Lateral recess stenosis may be the major offending blockage in the canal. This may be treated with a total laminectomy or a bilateral medial facetectomy performed through the microscope with excellent decompression of the lateral recess. Foraminal stenosis can also be decompressed from a paraspinous position with the foraminotomy performed from the outside in. This can be combined with a microscopic medial facetectomy. Essentially, all these operations remove bone and redundant tissue to allow the nerve adequate freedom in the spinal canal and/or intervertebral foramina. Fusions are performed predominantly for degenerative spondylolisthesis to prevent the recurrence of radiculopathy. Internal fixation may be indicated in any situation in which the surgeon feels that the fusion rate is potentially compromised, but he or she must be aware that internal fixation does not guarantee spine fusion. Spinal instrumentation certainly increases the complication rate. The number of levels fused and the inclusion of the sacrum are important in predicting the fusion rate.\r"

Conservative dietary approaches to weight loss in the obese patient and a high-carbohydrate diet for maximum exercise performance are sound approaches, although diets often need to be individualized. Recent dietary recommendations to reduce fat and increase fiber can be applied without risk of compromising nutritional status for most patients. Guidance away from extremes in caloric restriction and in the distribution of calories may help to promote health and the maintenance of exercise activities. Although requirements for certain micronutrients are affected by aging, vitamin and mineral supplements are unlikely to be necessary for healthy adults and should meet basic criteria for safety if they are prescribed. Diet sources of calcium may require attention, although iron requirements are reduced among postmenopausal women when compared with younger athletes. Adequate fluid replacement is essential for athletes of all ages. For the older athlete who is competing in high-intensity endurance exercise, evidence for the usefulness of 4% to 10% carbohydrate-containing sports drinks exists. Little evidence supports the use of ergogenic aids, such as supplements and unusual food products. Resources and personalized guidance from a registered dietitian can be helpful for many older athletes.\r"

Fourteen out of 25 patients required dialysis on admission, 11/25 patients did not. All patients were treated with a novel protocol comprising methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. The median follow-up observation was 36 months (12-113 months). With the exception of 1 patient (who died from causes not related to Wegener's granulomatosis) all patients are alive. Among the patients initially requiring dialysis (n = 14) 4 are in terminal renal failure after 0, 7, 21 and 38 months respectively. In the nondialysis group (n = 11) only 1 patient subsequently required chronic dialysis 30 months after clinical admission. Renal failure was due to non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy in at least 2 patients. Percentage of obsolescent glomeruli and the degree of tubulointerstitial lesions, but not active glomerular lesions (crescents, necroses) predicted renal outcome. The major cause of renal functional impairment was relapse of Wegener's granulomatosis usually within 2 years after clinical remission. Therefore prolonged treatment with cyclophosphamide for at least 2 years after clinical remission is recommended. Two patients with initially negative immunohistology had a second renal biopsy which revealed de novo appearance of mesangial IgA deposits.\r"

During regular hemodialysis opposing influences on PAVP (decrease in blood pressure and intravascular volume and increase in serum calcium) resulted in no significant change in PAVP (by analysis of variance). In the second protocol low dialysate calcium (2.5 meq/l) isovolemic hemodialysis was used. PAVP and serum osmolality levels declined from 2.0 +/- 0.4 to 1.4 +/- 0.2 microU/ml (p less than 0.05), and 285 +/- 2.5 mOsm/l to 275 +/- 3.2 mOsm/l respectively. Removal of PAVP by hemodialysis did not occur as evidenced by no difference in arterial-venous PAVP levels and no \"rebound\" of PAVP for three hours after completion of dialysis (second protocol). Isovolemic low calcium high dialysate sodium (145 meq/l) hemodialysis was utilized in the third protocol. Serum osmolality and PAVP did not change. Addition of a very high dialysate sodium (155 meq/l) to isovolemic low calcium hemodialysis resulted in an increase in plasma sodium, osmolality and AVP (139.7 +/- 0.62 to 144 +/- 0.67 meq/l, 294 +/- 2.79 to 304.3 +/- 2.4 mOsm/l and 1.8 +/- 0.3 to 2.7 +/- 0.5 microU/ml (p less than 0.05 for each) respectively.

After 6 months, the average in vivo dialyzer urea clearance had fallen from 152 to 132 ml/min and consequently Kt/V values had become undesirably low in most of the patients in whom the relatively short dialysis regimens had been kept unchanged. There was also a significant decrease of protein intake. As a result of both changes there was only a moderate increase of predialysis mean blood urea concentration. These findings indicate that after correction of anemia by r-HuEPO dialyzer performance decreased. The concomitant decrease of protein intake seems to contrast to the improved general physical condition and appetite as indicated in the questionnaires. Although body weight remained the same, there might have been a tendency to avoid protein consumption with maintained total calory intake as a result of slight underdialysis. Therefore, in individual cases dialysis prescriptions may need reconsideration when Ht levels rise after r-HuEPO administration, especially in short dialysis regimens.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty neurophysiological parameters were employed to evaluate the presence and the degree of peripheral neuropathy (PNP) in a cohort of 135 patients (pts) on regular dialysis treatment (RDT) for 2 to 184 months. The 135 pts were divided into 3 groups according to the duration of RDT (group I: 52 pts with less than 5 yrs; group II: 46 pts 5 to 10 yrs; group III: 37 pts 10 to 15 yrs). Each group was then divided into two subgroups according to age (less or more than 47 yrs) to evaluate the influence of age on PNP. Correlations of electrophysiological parameters with some biochemical parameters (urea, creatinine, PTH) were looked for. The presence of clinical PNP was evaluated according to the Bolton classification: in group I, 50% of pts have mild PNP; in group II, 45.7% of pts have mild PNP; in group III, 81.1% have mild, 10.8% have moderate and 2.7% of pts have severe PNP. In as many as 84.4% of the 135 pts at least one of the 20 parameters studied had abnormal values and in 63% two or more parameters were abnormal. Of 20 parameters evaluated separately in the 3 groups only three showed abnormal mean values: sural nerve latency in all 3 groups; sural nerve Sensory Conduction Velocity (SCV) and peroneal nerve Max. Motor Conduction Velocity (MCV) in group III. Five parameters referring to ulnar nerves and two referring to the sural nerve were significantly more impaired in the group of pts with the longest duration of RDT and in this group the impairment was more severe in older patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In addition, levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were monitored during the trial period in serum and dialysate; serum levels of anti-alpha hemolysin and dialysate levels of fibronectin and specific antistaphylococcal antibodies were also measured. Over the period, treatment with SB or SS did not affect the incidence of peritonitis, catheter-related infection or S. aureus nasal carriage. However, vaccination with SB elicited a significant increase in the level of serum anti-alpha hemolysin throughout the 12 month duration of the study, although the level of increase was unrelated to the subsequent rate of peritonitis. Vaccination with SB but not SS elicited a significant increase in the dialysate level of specific antibodies against S. aureus. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were within the normal range in the CAPD patients studied and remained unaffected by vaccination with SB. In addition, dialysate levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were 50-100 times lower than corresponding serum levels and remained unaffected by vaccination. In summary, immunisation with an anti-staphylococcal agent was not successful in reducing peritonitis or exit site infection in CAPD patients.\r"

  ".W": "Subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was given for 12 months twice weekly to 10 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with anemia (hemoglobin less than 9.0 mg/dl). All patients responded to a median weekly dose of between 37.5 to 100 (mean 55 to 105) units/kg and reached a target hemoglobin of 10-12 mg/dl in a mean of 11.7 weeks (range 5-24). Serum iron, iron saturation and ferritin were significantly lower and serum potassium was significantly higher than the pre-treatment level from 1 month onwards. Five patients without pre-treatment iron overload required oral iron supplement and 3 required oral potassium-binding resin. No significant change in other serum biochemical parameters was observed. Blood pressure remained stable during the treatment period but additional or increased dosage of antihypertensive drugs was required in 5 patients. Peritoneal small solute clearance and ultrafiltration and residual renal clearance did not change significantly after correction of anemia. The incidence of peritonitis and exit site infection was similarly unaffected. One patient developed a severe headache which was not associated with hypertension and responded to withdrawal of rHuEPO treatment. Most of the remaining patients showed improvement in subjective well-being. It was concluded that the subcutaneous route twice a week is a safe, convenient and cost-effective way to administer rHuEPO to patients on CAPD.\r"

Both patients had 4 peritoneal dialysis exchanges (2 liters each) per day. Blood concentrations of Al increased 413% (patient A) and 190% (patient B) after DFO. Patient B had a 15% increase in Fe; other metals remained unchanged. Dialysate efflux Al concentrations had peak post-DFO increments of 761% and 840% in patients 1 and 2, respectively. Peak post-DFO increments in Fe dialysate concentration were 342% and 89.5% in the respective patients. Dialysate/plasma (D/P) concentration ratios of Al increased from pre-DFO levels (mean +/- SEM) of 0.370 +/- 0.048 to 0.523 +/- 0.061 after DFO; similarly, Fe D/P ratios increased from 0.259 +/- 0.053 to 0.446 +/- 0.075 with DFO therapy. These results indicate an increase in the ultrafiltrable proportion of Al and Fe in plasma after DFO administration. During 3 days after DFO, patient 1 had a total removal of Al and Fe of 2.9 mg and 4.9 mg, respectively. Metal removal in patient 2 was 7.6 mg of Al and 2.7 mg of Fe. Peritoneal extraction of other trace metals was minor.\r"

  ".W": "Ultrasonographic changes around the shoulder joint were compared in ten symptomatic patients with dialysis related amyloid (DRA) and seventeen patients without symptoms. All patients had been on long-term (greater than 7 years) hemodialysis (HD). Three control groups were used: 8 predialysis patients, 10 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 9 HD patients who had been on dialysis for less than two years. Dry bodyweight, sex, handedness, length of hemodialysis and fistula side were not significantly different between the study groups. Proven amyloid patients were significantly older than other groups (p less than 0.001). Parameters assessed included cross-sectional area of long head of biceps tendon (LHB), diameter of supraspinatus tendon (SS), and general features (bursae, deposits) around the joint. Results demonstrated significant differences in all parameters in patients with symptomatic amyloid compared with other long-term patients: [SS: 7.4 mm +/- 0.7, mean +/- SEM, vs 5.1 +/- 0.2 (right, R), p = 0.001; 6.7 +/- 0.7 vs 4.9 +/- 0.2 (left, L), p = 0.01. LHB: 140.0 mm2 +/- 11.1 vs 79.6 +/- 5.1 (R), p less than 0.001; 114.5 +/- 10.5 vs 80.8 +/- 5.4 (L), p = 0.004. Bursae: 5 vs 1 (patients), p = 0.006]. Compared with controls changes in the amyloid group were less marked though in most cases still significant. There was no significant difference between control groups nor between controls and asymptomatic long-term HD patients in any parameter. We conclude that shoulder ultrasound may have a role in identifying patients with dialysis related amyloid. Serial measurements may also help to elucidate the pathogenesis of the tendon changes.\r"

  ".W": "The interaction between fluoxetine and carbamazepine was investigated in six normal, healthy male volunteers (aged 23 to 40 years). Subjects were given carbamazepine, 400 mg every morning, for 3 weeks. Venous carbamazepine blood samples were obtained at baseline and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 24 hours after the morning dose. Fluoxetine, 20 mg every morning, was then coadministered with carbamazepine for 7 days. Venous carbamazepine blood samples were again obtained as described. Carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZE) were assayed by HPLC. Addition of fluoxetine resulted in a significant increase in the area under the concentration-time curve of carbamazepine (105.93 +/- 18.05 micrograms/ml.hr versus 134.97 +/- 12.15 micrograms/ml.hr; t = 3.284; df = 5; p = 0.022) and CBZE (11.6 +/- 1.93 micrograms/ml.hr versus 15.2 +/- 2.4 micrograms/ml.hr; t = 2.805; df = 5; p = 0.038). Both oral and intrinsic clearance of carbamazepine was decreased significantly on fluoxetine addition (3.87 +/- 0.68 L/hr versus 2.98 +/- 0.26 L/hr; t = 3.025; df = 5; p = 0.029 and 17.90 +/- 4.9 L/hr versus 11.92 +/- 1.4 L/hr; t = 3.037; df = 5; p = 0.029, respectively). No significant changes were determined for fraction of absorbed dose, volume of distribution, absorption rate constant, and elimination rate constant. These findings suggest that fluoxetine can inhibit the metabolism of carbamazepine. Careful monitoring of patients is recommended when these two drugs are coadministered.\r"

Patients receiving transdermal scopolamine were compared with patients receiving diphenhydramine, meclizine, prochlorperazine, and promethazine. A four-fold increased risk of seizures after transdermal scopolamine use was observed in the claims data. However, this was not supported by the primary medical records. All patients who had seizures after using transdermal scopolamine either had seizures before receiving the drug as well or did not really suffer from seizures. The original finding appeared to be the result of the use of transdermal scopolamine for \"dizziness, rule out seizures\"; the ICD-9-CM coding system does not include \"rule out\" diagnoses. Thus these data do not confirm the existence of an association between seizures and the use of transdermal scopolamine. In addition, this study demonstrates the usefulness of pharmacoepidemiology studies in documenting drug safety and the importance of obtaining primary medical records when performing pharmacoepidemiologic studies with claims data.\r"

Each volunteer received single oral doses of 15 mg midazolam on four separate occasions: 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, and 2 AM. An almost significant circadian variation was found in elimination half-life, shortest at 2 PM (1.26 +/- 0.47 hours, mean +/- SD) and longest at 2 AM (1.57 +/- 0.44 hours) (p = 0.05). Drug effects measured were alpha activity of the electroencepalograph and P100 latency of the visual-evoked response. The maximum drug effect (Emax) model described the concentration-effect relationship, extended with either a threshold drug concentration or a sigmoidicity parameter. A significant circadian variation was found in baseline alpha activity: highest at 8 AM (109% +/- 19% of the 24-hour mean) and lowest at 2 AM (80% +/- 12%). For alpha activity the drug concentration at half-maximum effect of both threshold Emax model and sigmoid Emax model showed lower values at 8 AM and 2 AM and higher values at 2 PM and 8 PM. However, these differences were either not significant (p = 0.10, threshold model) or on the verge of statistical significance (p = 0.05, sigmoid model). No circadian variation was found in the parameters describing the effect on the visual-evoked response. We conclude that the sensitivity of the central nervous system to midazolam, as reflected in alpha activity, possibly shows a circadian variation.\r"

Data for the two populations (i.e., infants less than or equal to 31 weeks' and greater than 31 but less than or equal to 34 weeks' gestational age) were obtained from infants admitted to the University of Texas Medical Branch intensive care nursery between August 1, 1988, and July 31, 1989. The new nonparametric method was demonstrated to be not only the equal of the standard two-stage method for population modeling but better, especially in use of sparse data sets (e.g., single serum levels). It also obviates the need for selecting proper starting conditions for the least-squares fitting procedure used in the standard two-stage method.\r"

The fastest rate of doxapram metabolism occurred during the first 3 hours of incubation (198 +/- 73.3, 438 +/- 63.3, and 538 +/- 62 ng/mg/hr liver protein at doxapram concentrations of 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). At 3 hours of incubation, the amount of doxapram metabolized (nanogram per milligram of liver protein) was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) at doxapram concentrations of 10.0 (1616 +/- 186) and 5.0 microgram/ml (1315 +/- 190) than at 2.5 micrograms/ml (594 +/- 220). The oxidative pathway producing keto-doxapram, or AHR 5955 and AHR 5904, is more active than the de-ethylation producing the analog of doxapram AHR 0914. Data indicate substantial metabolism of doxapram by the human fetal lives.\r"

The data were best described by a two-compartment model. Clearance depends on body weight, gestational age, and postnatal age. Volume of distribution of the central and peripheral compartments was also related to body weight. Including these patient characteristics in the population pharmacokinetic regression model resulted in a marked reduction of the unexplained interindividual variability. This enabled us to derive dosage recommendations that result in peak and average concentrations within the desired range for 95% of the neonates with gestational age above 31 weeks, thus avoiding the need for individual drug-level monitoring in a well-defined large group of patients. Only for infants with gestational age less than 31 weeks who are less than 6 days old is individual dose adjustment based on serum concentration measurements required.\r"

However plasma levels of 9-alpha 11-beta prostaglandin F2, a stable metabolite of prostaglandin D2, became undetectable in most subjects with the development of tolerance. Thus tolerance is not associated with decreased levels of nicotinic acid or development of tolerance to the prostaglandin mediator, but with decreased levels of the mediator.\r"

One hour after administration of either 15 mg or 30 mg MK-467 or placebo, 200 micrograms clonidine was given intravenously and observations were made for a further 8 hours. Clonidine reduced plasma norepinephrine levels to 79% +/- 7% of that of control 1 hour after infusion, an effect that was antagonized by low-dose MK-467 (p less than 0.05). Mean systolic blood pressure increased by 4 mm Hg in the first hour after the 30 mg dose of MK-467 (p less than 0.01), although there was no significant difference between the 3 study days in the maximal clonidine-induced decrease in systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, or heart rate. Clonidine induced a peak increase in mean blood glucose of 13%, which was antagonized by both doses of MK-467 (p less than 0.05). Plasma insulin was suppressed by clonidine from 72 +/- 14 to 47 +/- 7 IU.L-1, an effect antagonised by both doses of MK-467 (p less than 0.05 in each case). MK-467 had no effect on clonidine-induced increased drowsiness, xerostomia, or increase in growth hormone secretion, which is consistent with it being a peripherally acting specific alpha 2-antagonist. The small effect of MK-467 on clonidine-induced changes in plasma glucose and insulin suggests that peripheral alpha 2-adrenergic receptors play only a minor role in normal glucose homeostasis.\r"

Carbamazepine significantly lowered the mean number of positive urine specimens compared with placebo. Of clinical importance, serum carbamazepine levels of 4 micrograms/ml (17 mumol/L) or more were associated with greater improvement. A consistent, clinically important trend linked therapeutic levels with improvement for all subjective and objective outcome variables. Comparison of daily acknowledged cocaine use or professed cocaine abstinence, with cocaine use indicated by daily urinalysis in these chronic cocaine users, has suggested the possibility of cocaine saturation as an important methodologic limitation inherent in outpatient studies of cocaine use in humans.\r"

In a double-blind crossover study 42 normotensive alcoholics (36 men and six women) aged 24 to 65 years, consuming 8.2 +/- 2.3 (mean +/- SD) standard alcoholic drinks per day, were randomized to enalapril, 10 mg/day (n = 20) or 20 mg/day (n = 22), and placebo for 4 weeks. They monitored their daily alcohol intake and attended biweekly assessments, but no other treatment or advice was given. Compliance and alcohol intake were verified objectively. Mean daily alcoholic drinks were not significantly different during 10 mg/day enalapril (mean +/- SEM, 7.5 +/- 0.5), and its placebo (7.2 +/- 0.5), but both decreased from baseline (8.1 +/- 0.5; both p less than 0.05). Similarly, mean daily drinks during 20 mg/day enalapril (6.8 +/- 0.6) and its placebo (7.2 +/- 0.4) was not significantly different, but both were lower than baseline (8.3 +/- 0.5; both p less than 0.01). Fourteen (64%) of the patients taking 20 mg/day enalapril decreased alcohol intake from placebo by an average of 21% (range, 1.6% to 78.3%). Self-ratings of interest, desire, craving, and liking for alcohol also decreased from baseline during enalapril and placebo treatments, but the effects of both were similar. Plasma renin activity increased, compared with placebo, after 10 mg/day enalapril (from 0.3 +/- 0.2 [mean +/- SD] to 1.9 +/- 1.5 ng/L/sec) and after 20 mg/day enalapril (from 0.4 +/- 0.3 to 2.8 +/- 4.0 ng/L/sec) (both p less than 0.05). Blood pressure decreased within a normotensive range, compared with placebo, with 10 mg/day enalapril (by 6.0 and 8.5 mm Hg systolic and diastolic blood pressures) and 20 mg/day enalapril (by 7.7 and 5.0 mm Hg, respectively). Side effects were few and mild. No patient characteristic or drug effect correlated with changes in alcohol intake. There were no significant variations in nonalcoholic beverages, cigarette smoking, or body weight. These results indicate that enalapril does not alter alcohol intake in normotensive alcoholics with normal plasma renin activity. Studies with higher doses of enalapril in humans may be limited by increased frequency and severity of side effects.\r"

  ".W": "Deficiencies in the release of glucagon and adrenaline during hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients are associated with a high frequency of severe hypoglycaemic episodes. These have been attributed to a resulting inability to increase hepatic glucose output acutely. A more important consequence may be reduced awareness of impending hypoglycaemia. Such hypoglycaemia unawareness is related to, but not entirely explained by, diminished sympathetic activity, perhaps due to failure to activate the sympathoadrenal system until a lower blood glucose level is achieved. The patient's subsequent failure to act appropriately would then be due to impaired cerebral function preventing the perception of sympathoadrenal activation during the more severe hypoglycaemia. Unawareness of moderate hypoglycaemia is common in diabetic patients. Autonomic neuropathy probably accounts for only a few cases of hypoglycaemia unawareness and other factors which are potentially important include duration of diabetes, glycaemic control, insulin species, and the degree and frequency of hypoglycaemia. Further research is required to discover both the pathophysiological mechanisms of, and the treatment needed to reverse or prevent, the abnormality.\r"

It is, however, unclear whether the hypoglycaemic effect of sulphonylurea derivatives is additive to the effect of glucose, or whether sulphonylurea derivatives act by increasing B-cell glucose sensitivity. 2. We assessed the effect of gliclazide on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in eight healthy volunteers. Sixty minute hyperglycaemic glucose clamps (blood glucose levels of 8, 11 and 32 mmol/l) were performed, with and without prior administration of gliclazide (80 mg) 90 min before the glucose clamp. 3. Dose-response characteristics were assessed with a modified Michaelis-Menten equation. The Vmax. (maximal B-cell responsiveness) was not significantly changed (1.5 +/- 0.1 versus 1.3 +/- 0.2 and 5.0 +/- 0.5 versus 4.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l for the first- and second-phase insulin secretion, respectively), whereas the ED50 (half-maximally stimulating blood glucose concentration) was significantly decreased by gliclazide for first-phase insulin secretion (7.6 +/- 0.3 versus 9.1 +/- 0.6 mmol/l) but not for second-phase insulin secretion (12.0 +/- 0.5 versus 12.3 +/- 0.5 mmol/l). 4. We conclude that gliclazide indeed leads to a shift to the left of the dose-response curve of first-phase insulin release in vivo without a change in Vmax, which indicates an apparent enhancement of B-cell glucose sensitivity.\r"

At 20 weeks of age, the levels of erythrocyte Na+ efflux, as well as Na+ and K+ contents in erythrocytes, were measured. 3. On the low-Ca2+ diet, spontaneously hypertensive rats showed an enhancement of hypertension. Conversely, on the high-Ca2+ diet, they showed an attenuation of the increase in blood pressure. Spontaneously hypertensive rats had a lower erythrocyte Na+ content and increased activity of the Na+ pump at higher levels of dietary Ca2+. Passive Na+ permeability and Na(+)-K+ co-transport were similar in spontaneously hypertensive rats on the low-, normal- and high-Ca2+ diets. There were no significant differences in blood pressure and in Na+ pump activity in WKY on the three different diets. 4. It is concluded that dietary Ca2+ might affect the regulation of blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats by changing the activity of Na+ pump in the cell membrane.\r"

In 26 healthy smoking and non-smoking women (age 21-49 years) the urinary excretion of the thromboxane A2 metabolite 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 (an index of platelet activation) and of the prostacyclin metabolite 2,3-dinor-6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (an index of platelet/vessel wall interaction) were analysed by g.c.-m.s. in samples collected on days 3, 10 and 20 of their respective menstrual cycles. 3. The urinary excretion of 2,3-dinor-thromboxane B2 did not vary significantly during the menstrual cycle, either in the smokers or in the non-smokers.

Twenty-one haemodialysis patients with moderate iron overload, confirmed by values of serum ferritin concentration, transferrin saturation and hepatic computed tomography density exceeding 1000 micrograms/l, 45% and 68 Hounsfield units respectively, were randomly allocated to three groups and were followed for 12 months. 3.

Thereafter, in the second 6 months of observation patients in group 1 were switched to receive recombinant human erythropoietin.

Insulin and glucose were infused for 120 min. Plasma insulin increased approximately 10-fold over preclamp levels (5.6 +/- 0.9 m-units/l pre-clamp and 54 +/- 5 m-units/l over the last hour of infusion; mean +/- SEM, n = 4). Plasma glucose concentration did not change significantly (5.4 +/- 0.2 mmol/l pre-clamp and 5.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/l over the last hour of infusion). 3. Insulin and glucose infusion resulted in a decline in the intracellular pH of forearm muscle of 0.027 +/- 0.007 unit/h (P less than 0.01), whereas in control studies of the same subjects, pH rose by 0.046 +/- 0.005 unit/h (P less than 0.001). 4. In the clamp studies, intracellular inorganic phosphate concentration rose by 18%/h, whereas ATP, phosphocreatine and phosphomonoester concentrations did not change. In plasma, inorganic phosphate concentration was 1.16 +/- 0.05 mmol/l before infusion, and this decreased by a mean rate of 0.14 mmol h-1 l-1. No change was observed in any of these intracellular metabolites in the control studies. 5. The results show that, under physiological conditions, insulin does not raise intracellular pH in human muscle, and thus cannot influence muscle metabolism by this mechanism. The results also suggest that insulin causes a primary increase in the next flux of inorganic phosphate across the muscle cell membrane.\r"

In these experiments the efficacy of the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine in improving the survival of ischaemic rabbit epigastric skin flaps was tested. 2. At the time of reperfusion flaps were given: (1) balanced salt solution by intravenous whole-body administration, (2) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intravenous whole-body administration, (3) balanced salt solution by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, (4) N-acetylcysteine (20 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, or (5) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap. Flap survival at 1 week, and tissue levels of parameters related to free-radical production, blood levels of thromboxane B2 and peripheral resistance during reperfusion were determined. 3. Compared with controls (groups 1 and 3) which had flap survival rates (expressed as percentage surface area surviving) of 27.1% and 31.6%, respectively. N-acetylcysteine treatment in group 2 (55.2%) and group 4 (51.9%) resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) improvements in flap survival. The survival rate in group 5 (37.7%) was not significantly better than that of the controls. 4. N-Acetylcysteine significantly reduced parameters related to free-radical production in the skin flap after 30 min of reperfusion, determined as tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and protein oxidation products. There was also a significant decrease in peripheral resistance when low-dose N-acetylcysteine (group 4) was infused intra-arterially into the flap.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Dexamethasone resulted in a negative nitrogen balance, and produced decreases in the blood concentrations of glutamine (32.3%) and glutamate (25.3%) but an increase in the blood concentration of alanine (33.9%). 3. Dexamethasone treatment increases the rates of production of glutamine and alanine by lung slices incubated in vitro. 4. Blood flow and arteriovenous concentration difference measurement across the lungs exhibited an increase in the net exchange rates of glutamine (131.6%) and alanine (113.2%) in dexamethasone-treated rats compared with corresponding pair-fed controls. 5. Dexamethasone treatment produced significant decreases in the lung concentrations of glutamine (47.2%), glutamate (30.9%) and 2-oxoglutarate (57.3%). The concentrations of alanine (52.1%), ammonia (24.7%) and pyruvate (43.7%) were increased. 6. The maximal activity of glutamine synthetase was increased (21.5%), but there was no marked change in that of glutaminase, in the lungs of dexamethasone-treated rats. 7. It is concluded that glucocorticoid administration enhances the rates of production of glutamine and alanine from lungs of rats (both in vitro and in vivo). This may be due to changes in efflux and/or increased intracellular biosynthesis of glutamine and alanine.\r"

  ".W": "1. Skin microcirculation was investigated in 12 asymptomatic subjects and 76 patients, grouped according to their ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index, in order to evaluate to what extent posturally induced microvascular constriction is dependent on the stage of leg ischaemia at different local skin temperatures. 2. Skin microcirculation was assessed in the supine and sitting position by using laser Doppler fluxmetry at unheated skin temperature and at 36 degrees C, and transcutaneous oximetry at 37 degrees C and 44 degrees C. 3. Skin perfusion and oxygenation diminished with decreasing ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index. In healthy control subjects, perfusion and oxygenation were reduced when changing from the supine to the sitting position, but were enhanced in patients with severe leg ischaemia (ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure less than 30%), indicating disturbed posturally induced vasoconstriction. 4. Increasing the local skin temperature resulted in a higher perfusion and masked the posturally induced vasoconstriction in healthy subjects. In patients with severe leg ischaemia, however, perfusion was unaltered by the temperature increase, apparently because the microvessels were already maximally dilated. The induction of reactive hyperaemia produced no additional increase in perfusion or oxygenation. 5. It is concluded that posturally induced microvascular constriction in the skin is disturbed in patients with severe leg ischaemia (ankle-to-brachial systolic blood pressure index less than 30%). Disturbed microvascular constriction upon dependency was also seen in healthy subjects after local skin heating. This suggests that posturally induced vasoconstriction is mainly regulated by local mechanisms.\r"

In order to examine the effects of experimental hypertension on intracellular pH in mesenteric resistance arteries, intracellular pH was measured in mesenteric resistance arteries from rats with coarctation 72 h, 9 days and 28 days after the aorta was partially constricted between the origins of the renal arteries. Carotid arterial pressure was significantly raised at all time points. 2. Second-order mesenteric resistance arteries were mounted in a myograph and were loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Morphological measurements demonstrated that arteries from rats with coarctation had an increased media volume at 9 days and at 28 days compared with vessels from sham-operated control animals, but this was only statistically significant at 28 days. 3. Resting intracellular pH was not significantly different at any time point in arteries from rats with coarctation compared with control animals, although there was a rise in intracellular pH in both groups of rats between 72 h and 9 days. The application of 4,4-di-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid produced a fall in intracellular pH which was significantly greater in the sham-operated rats at 9 days; this difference was not found at 28 days. Blockade of Na+/H+ exchange with 60 mumol/l ethylisopropylamiloride led to a similar fall in intracellular pH in both groups of rats at 9 days but a significantly greater fall in intracellular pH in arteries of rats with coarctation at 28 days. Activation with noradrenaline (10 mumol/l) induced acid changes in intracellular pH that were similar in both groups of rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The difference in membrane potential was significant (P less than 0.001). 3. The relationship between the log of the extracellular K+ concentration and membrane potential was nonlinear over the extracellular K+ concentration range 2.5-20 mmol/l, and showed a small positive shift with hypertension. 4.

In vascular smooth muscle from hypertensive animals, the hyperpolarization in low-Na+ media was significantly increased to 12.2 +/- 2.6 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 5), but that in low-Cl- media was unaffected (2.7 +/- 1.6 mV, n = 6). 5.

Gastric sodium loading causes release of vasoactive intestinal peptide from the gastrointestinal tract and, in rabbits on a low-sodium diet, an apparent decrease in metabolism of vasoactive intestinal peptide by the liver. Other workers have shown that decreased hepatic metabolism of vasoactive intestinal peptide is accompanied by an increase in pulmonary metabolism of vasoactive intestinal peptide. To determine whether oral sodium loading also regulates non-hepatic metabolism of vasoactive intestinal peptide, metabolic clearance studies of intravenously infused vasoactive intestinal peptide were performed. These studies were performed in male New Zealand White rabbits equilibrated on normal- and low-sodium diets before and after an acute gastric sodium load of 1.5 mmol/kg. 2. The metabolic clearance rate of vasoactive intestinal peptide was significantly greater in rabbits on the low-sodium diet than in rabbits on the normal-sodium diet both before (P less than 0.025) and after (P less than 0.05) a gastric sodium load. Significant decreases in metabolic clearance rate were observed in response to the sodium load in both dietary groups (normal-sodium diet, P less than 0.05; low-sodium diet, P less than 0.025). The theoretical secretion rate of vasoactive intestinal peptide also fell after the gastric sodium load in rabbits on the low-sodium diet (P less than 0.05) and the half-life of vasoactive intestinal peptide increased (P less than 0.01). 3. We conclude that the non-hepatic metabolism of vasoactive intestinal peptide appears to be responsive to both chronic dietary sodium intake and acute gastric sodium loading.\r"

The effect of moderate endurance exercise on blood glucose concentration and on glucoregulatory hormones was studied in nine thyrotoxic and five myxoedematous humans before and 3 months after anti-thyroid and substitution therapy, respectively. 2. At rest, the fasting concentrations of insulin and pro-insulin correlated positively with the prevailing total tri-iodothyronine concentration, whereas the concentrations of noradrenaline and cortisol correlated inversely with the tri-iodothyronine concentration. 3. During exercise the plasma insulin, pro-insulin and C-peptide concentrations decreased. The plasma glucagon concentration increased slightly in thyrotoxic patients before and after treatment and was largely unchanged in myxoedematous patients in either state. 4. The plasma noradrenaline concentration increased before and after treatment in both groups, with concentrations two times higher in the myxoedematous than in the thyrotoxic patients. Treatment for 3 months did not change this pattern. The plasma adrenaline concentration increased in both groups, but in the untreated thyrotoxic patients the increase was two to three times greater than that after treatment or that in the myxoedematous group. 5. The blood glucose concentration decreased in eight of nine untreated thyrotoxic patients, but was largely unchanged after treatment or in the myxoedematous patients. A strong negative correlation was found between the decline in blood glucose concentration and the increase in plasma adrenaline concentration in the thyrotoxic group. 6. Thus, during exercise untreated thyrotoxic patients are prone to hypoglycaemia, show an inadequate glucagon response, and exhibit a large counter-regulatory increase in plasma adrenaline concentration.\r"

We sought to modify the available surgical techniques to provide a solution to this challenging problem. Between December 1983 and January 1990, 14 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of a rectovaginal fistula. A modified transvaginal approach was employed by the authors. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed on all patients, either as the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. The fistula was completely eradicated in 13 of the 14 women and did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 55.0 months (range, 3-77 months). Intestinal continuity was reestablished in these 13 patients within 6 months after the initial fistula repair. One patient with a very low-lying fistula constituted our only failure. We have found the transvaginal method preferable to the transanal approach because of the relative ease in raising the vaginal flap as compared with a flap of fibrotic and inflamed anorectal mucosa. On the basis of this study, we conclude that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulas secondary to Crohn's disease.\r"

The mean follow-up was 38.1 months. Sixteen patients have a functioning pouch, seven have required pouch excision, one is diverted, and one has died. Only one of nine patients in whom there was a preoperative clinical feature suggestive of Crohn's disease has a functioning pouch, with complications uniformly occurring within months of ileostomy closure. In contrast, 15 of 16 patients without preoperative features of Crohn's disease have maintained their pouch, generally with good results. These data suggest that patients in whom there is clinical and pathologic evidence of Crohn's disease do very poorly without meaningful symptom-free intervals. However, patients without any clinical features of Crohn's disease, despite a histopathologic diagnosis of Crohn's colitis, have had a good outcome with IPAA thus far.\r"

The aim of this study was to develop a model of colon cancer induced by azoxymethane in the rat and to study the outcome after surgical resection alone or in association with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Three hundred male Wistar rats received subcutaneous azoxymethane (10 mg/kg body weight/week) for 12 weeks. Eighty-three rats with isolated colon cancer underwent total colectomy; 40 of these rats with no metastases were randomized into two groups: surgery alone or surgery plus 5-FU (5 mg/kg body weight/day) for 5 days after surgery. Thirty rats were able to be evaluated. At autopsy, peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastases were more frequent in the control group than after adjuvant treatment with 5-FU (27.7 percent vs. 0, P less than 0.05; and 22.2 percent vs. 0, P less than 0.05, respectively). The rates of peritoneal and hepatic recurrence after resection of the primary cancer indicate that the model mimics the natural history of human colon cancer. In this model, 5-FU reduced the rate of peritoneal carcinomatosis and liver metastases but did not influence survival.\r"

Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing.

  ".W": "The intestinal sling procedure has been used successfully without the observance of pelvic infections. This procedure involves the implantation of polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh to hold the bowel out of the pelvis to prevent radiation enteritis. We previously showed that PGA mesh has no intrinsic bactericidal activity. Since phagocytic leukocytes produce reactive oxygen intermediates during respiratory burst that are associated with oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity, we examined peritoneal cell types and their respiratory burst activity isolated from patients with biopsy-confirmed rectal carcinoma who underwent the intestinal sling procedure (N = 12) compared with patients who did not (N = 13). There was no significant difference in the cell types within the peritoneal cavity over the 7-day postoperative period examined. However, there was a significant increase in the ability of leukocytes isolated from mesh patients to produce hydrogen peroxide in the absence of an exogenous stimulus (P less than 0.05), as measured by flow cytometric quantitation of oxidation of the hydroperoxide-sensitive dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). Despite the higher endogenous DCFH oxidation by leukocytes from mesh patients, the cells retained the ability to oxidize DCFH following treatment with a membrane-active stimulant for respiratory burst activity, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. These observations suggest that PGA mesh used for the intestinal sling procedure stimulates the respiratory burst activity of peritoneal leukocytes during the postoperative period in which bacterial proliferation and colonization occur. The stimulation of reactive oxygen intermediates involved in oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity by PGA mesh may be one of the mechanisms underlying the lack of infections observed with the use of PGA mesh in contaminated settings.\r"

There were 18 women and two men with a mean age of 63 years (range, 34-91 years). The mean follow-up was 34 months (range, 6-62 months). Anal margin cancers and adenocarcinomas were excluded. Fourteen of 20 patients treated had a complete response. There were six local failures: three with residual disease at the end of treatment and three with recurrent disease at a later date. Of the three with residual disease, one underwent abdominoperineal resection and two received salvage therapy (one with chemo-radiation and one with radiation alone). All three patients with recurrent disease were treated with abdominoperineal resection. All six were disease free at the end of the study. Of the 14 patients with complete local response, one presented with liver metastases 19 months later. Sixteen patients (80 percent) were alive at the end of the study, and 19 patients (95 percent) had no evidence of disease. These data add support for salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with residual disease following initial chemo-radiation therapy. Salvage options for patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus who fail the Nigro protocol will be discussed.\r"

Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin-II (GSA-II), and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) was investigated in tumor and background tissue from a total of 34 adenoma and 44 cancer patients and compared with reaction patterns in control and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients. Adenoma patients with UEA-I positive rectal mucosa were found to have a 33.3 percent familial history of large bowel cancer, which was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the respective 4.0 percent figure for patients with negative rectal mucosa. In the cancer patients, an even stronger correlation was noted, with a 63.2 percent UEA-I positive family history association being recorded, as opposed to 4.0 percent in the negative rectal mucosa patients (P less than 0.01). Thus, the results suggest that, apparently, normal rectal background mucosa of individuals genetically at high risk for colon and rectal cancer demonstrates a specific lectin binding ability similar to that of FAP patients and that the simple method using UEA-I staining of rectal biopsy specimens can be of practical use in identification of high-risk colorectal cancer.\r"

During a prospective follow-up review of 215 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, pouchitis was diagnosed in 30 patients (14 percent). Based on the clinical course, two distinct patterns of pouchitis were recognized: patients who experienced two or fewer episodes (Group 1-18 patients) and patients who experienced at least three episodes (Group 2-12 patients). Histopathologic review of resected colons revealed a preponderance of indeterminate colitis in patients in Group 2 (58.3 percent) compared with patients in Group 1 (0 percent). In Group 1; 88.9 percent of patients responded to therapy with metronidazole. Only 25 percent of patients in Group 2 responded to metronidazole alone. Most patients in Group 2 required sulfasalazine, topical steroids, or both. Of the 30 patients with pouchitis, four (13.3 percent) had a distinct endoscopic pattern of distal inflammation. This subset of patients with short strip pouchitis was successfully treated with topical steroid preparations. The clinical differences suggest different causes of pouchitis in these two groups.\r"

The results of manometric investigations were compared with those obtained in 12 healthy volunteers. In all patients, the resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly higher than in control subjects. In 10 patients, defecography revealed abnormalities of the pelvic muscles. We treated the patients by using biofeedback techniques, consisting of voluntary modifications of the state of contraction of the external sphincter. In all cases, pain disappeared after a mean of eight biofeedback training sessions. When noxious manifestations had disappeared, manometry showed a significant decrease in the anal canal resting pressure. Our results indicate 1) that chronic idiopathic anal pain is associated with abnormal anorectal manometric profiles, probably resulting from a dysfunctioning of the striated external anal sphincter, and 2) that biofeedback training is an effective treatment for chronic idiopathic anal pain.\r"

It is assumed that FA have a much higher malignancy potential than previously expected since, histologically, benign-appearing FA with moderate atypia have already contained malignant DNA patterns. In particular, those more than 5 mm in diameter show aneuploidy in 80 percent. These data suggest that FA with moderate atypia play an important role in the pathogenesis of small colonic carcinomas.\r"

To examine the changes occurring during development, we analyzed by RIA the pancreatic concentrations of these two peptides in fetal and neonatal rats. The levels obtained were compared with those of the classical islet hormones, insulin, somatostatin, and glucagon. The total hormone content of the pancreas increased with age for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin. The amounts of GLP-1-(7-36) amide immunoreactivity (IR) and PYY, however, remained approximately constant in the 3-, 8-, and 30-day-old and adult pancreas. GLP-1-(7-36) amide IR showed only a single peak by gel chromatography, but further analysis by anion exchange chromatography showed that during the fetal period (-18 days) and 3 days postpartum GLP-1-(7-36) amide was the main product, whereas 30 days postpartum and in adult pancreas mainly GLP-1 and an intermediate form were found. Similar analyses of gut extracts revealed that only GLP-1-(7-36) amide is produced during intestinal development. The gut content of GLP-1-(7-36) amide IR and PYY IR increased approximately 100 times between the fetus and the 30-day-old rat. This study reveals a complex and specific regulation of posttranslational processing during maturation for these two peptides.\r"

  ".U": "91309513\r", 
  ".W": "A previous report from our laboratory described an approximately 30 kilodalton (kDa) insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) that inhibited the binding of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) by its receptor and was secreted by a subline of the B104 rat neuronal cell line. To better understand the biology of this IGFBP, it was purified from media conditioned by these B104 cells, and the chemical and biological properties of the protein were examined. The IGFBP existed as a 24 kDa form and a 28 kDa form when the conditioned media were analyzed by ligand blot. Deglycosylation studies indicated the 28 kDa species was the N-linked glycosylated form of the 24 kDa IGFBP. Multiple forms at both mol wts were found using two-dimensional electrophoresis, suggesting that there were posttranslational modifications in addition to glycosylation. The amino acid sequence of the 12 amino-terminal residues was identical to that of rat IGFBP-4. Increased synthesis of IGFBP-4 by the subline contrasted with neglible production by other B104 cells. Blot hybridization with rat IGFBP-4 complementary DNA showed differential expression of a 2.6 kilobase transcript among B104 cell lines that correlated with quantities of IGFBP-4 secreted in media. The difference persisted even when the cells were xenografted into athymic nude mice. Purified IGFBP-4 inhibited the binding of [125I]IGF-I by its receptor and blunted stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation by IGF-I. These findings suggest a role for IGFBP-4 in neural cell function and indicate the B104 cell lines may be a useful model for further examination of IGFBP-4 biology.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin modifies the effects of PTH on osteoblast-like cells. However, the basis for this effect is unknown. In bone and kidney cells, the effects of PTH on cellular function are mediated by second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems. Therefore, we examined the effects of insulin on PTH second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells. PTH produced a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) which was maximal at 30 sec and was only minimally reduced in the absence of extracellular calcium. Inositol-triphosphate (IP3) production was increased in parallel. PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i was concentration-dependent from 0.5-1,000 nM, with half-maximal stimulation at approximately 50 nM PTH. A 30-sec exposure to 50 nM PTH produced 32% and 23% increases in IP1 and IP3 production, respectively (both P less than 0.05). Although insulin alone did not significantly alter basal [Ca2+]i, a 1-min exposure to 1-100 nM insulin produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the PTH-stimulated transient increase in [Ca2+]i and IP3 generation. 100 nM insulin decreased 50 nM PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i and IP3 levels by 84% (P less than 0.02) and 80% (P less than 0.001), respectively. Preexposure to insulin also decreased PTH stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels, but to a lesser degree. A 1-min exposure to 100 nM insulin produced a 32% (P less than 0.01) decrease in PTH-stimulated cAMP generation, but lower insulin concentrations were without significant effects. These results demonstrate that in UMR-106-01 cells, insulin suppresses PTH stimulation of second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems, but has a more marked effect on the former.\r"

Various substrates or inhibitors of the enzyme, including rT3, T4, T3, 6-n-propylthiouracil (PTU), and iopanoic acid, were used as competitors to establish the specificity of protein labeling. The PAL derivatization enhanced the behavior of T4 and T3 as substrates for the type I enzyme. No specific labeling of microsomal proteins was observed with either rT3 or T4-PAL, presumably due to deiodination of the labeled compound. In contrast, T3-PAL labeled a 27-kDa band, the presence of which paralleled thyroid status. The labeling of only this protein was blocked by either substrates or enzyme inhibitors in a dose-dependent fashion, with a rank order of potency predicted by the activity of such compounds in type I enzyme assays. The specific nature of these competitions provides further evidence that this 27-kDa protein, identified in previous studies using N-bromoacetyl [125I]T3 or -T4, contains the active site of the rat type I deiodinase. This is in agreement with the mol wt of the rat type I deiodinase deduced from the recently identified cDNA coding for this protein.\r"

  ".U": "91309518\r", 
  ".W": "The acetyl-coenzyme-A carboxylase (ACC) gene contains two promoters: promoter I (PI) and promoter II (PII). Depending upon which promoter is active, two classes of ACC mRNA are formed. The physiological significance of the presence of two promoters in the gene is not clear at this time. However, this question can be indirectly approached by examination of their expression patterns under different physiological conditions. We have examined the activities of these two promoters under different physiological conditions by means of primer extension analysis. Under normal conditions, the Wistar rat, fed standard chow ad libitum, expresses only basal levels of PI in white adipose tissue and PII in the liver. Starvation leads to the virtual disappearance of transcriptional products from these promoters. When fatty acid synthesis is stimulated by refeeding a fat-free diet to starved rats, both PI and PII are activated in the liver; however, in white adipose tissue, only PI, not PII, is responsive to this nutritional induction. On the other hand, in streptozotocin-diabetic rats, in which the activity of both promoters in both tissues is depressed, the administration of insulin quickly induces PI in adipose tissues, but has no significant effect on either of the promoters in the liver. During the weaning transition, the increase in hepatic lipogenesis is accompanied by activation of PI and PII when the pups are weaned onto a fat-free diet. Weaning onto a standard chow causes only a slight increase in PII. During the lactation period, profound alterations occur in the metabolism of the lipogenic tissues. In the lactating rat mammary gland only PII is active, and its activity is increased throughout lactation, reaching a plateau by day 7. Concomitantly, all ACC gene activity is completely shut off in the adipose tissue, while in the liver, PII, the only promoter active, is affected only minimally. The fat accumulation of the genetically obese Zucker rats is largely due to an abnormally high hepatic lipogenesis. In the obese Zucker rat (fa/fa), the level of expression of PII is similar to that in its lean siblings; however, PI is constitutively expressed at high levels, comparable to those in the Wistar rat that has been subjected to the starvation/refeeding induction. These studies demonstrate that the in vivo transcriptional control of the dual promoter rat ACC gene is a highly regulated and tissue-specific process.\r"

N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of this protein group showed 100% identity to rat insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (rIGFBP-2), the BRL-3A IGFBP purified from a fetal rat liver cell line. An antiserum was generated against this astrocyte 35,000 Mr protein, and immunoblot analysis revealed a dramatic increase in rIGFBP-2 secretion in astrocytes cultured from 14-day, 21-day, and adult rat brain compared to astrocytes from 1-day and 7-day rat brain. Similar analysis of neonatal rat brain neurons in culture failed to show immunoreactive rIGFBP-2 in cell lysates or secreted protein. Ligand Western blot analysis demonstrated [125I]IGF-II binding to a single protein band which comigrated with a prominant rIGFBP-2 immunoreactive species in nonreduced conditioned medium from 21-day astrocytes. In comparison [125I]IGF-II binding proteins were detected only at low levels in medium from astrocytes cultured from 1-day rat brain and were undetectable in neuron-conditioned media. Northern blot analysis using a rIGFBP-2 complementary DNA revealed 5-fold greater messenger RNA levels in astrocytes from 21-day rat brain compared with astrocytes from 1-day brain, whereas neonate neurons showed no transcripts. Thus, rIGFBP-2 exhibits a pattern of developmental and cell-specific expression in cultured rat brain cells.\r"

The selective AT-1 antagonist DuP 753 readily competed for AT receptors in liver, lung parenchyma, and choroid plexus, and these receptors are classified as AT-1 receptors. The selective AT-2 displacers CGP 42112 A and/or PD 123177 competed with high affinity with AT bound to most receptors located in skeletal muscle, skin, diaphragm, bronchi, and stomach, and these receptors are classified as AT-2 receptors. The amount of AT-2 receptors in fetal tissue was more than 10-fold higher than that of AT-1 receptors. In skeletal muscle and skin, DuP 753 competed with AT in the presence of 10(-7) M CGP 42112 A, indicating the presence of small numbers of AT-1 receptors. In liver and lung parenchyma, binding to AT-1 receptors was sensitive to guanine nucleotides. AT binding to AT-2 receptors in fetal skin and skeletal muscle was insensitive to guanine nucleotides. AT stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in liver (ED50, 64 nM) and in skin and skeletal muscle (ED50, 62 nM); this was inhibited by DuP 753 (liver IC50, 38 nM; skin and skeletal muscle IC50, 26 nM), but not by PD 123177 in concentrations up to the micromolar range. AT-1 receptors are probably coupled to G-proteins, and their stimulation increases phosphoinositide hydrolysis. AT-2 receptors may not be linked to G-proteins, their stimulation is not associated with phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and the nature of their second messenger system(s) is presently unknown.\r"

  ".W": "The secretion of the gonadotropins is modulated by the gonadal steroids, but the means by which these effects are mediated are not well understood. The present anatomical study was undertaken to investigate the possibility that the GnRH system responds to alterations in the gonadal steroid environment with reversible changes in synaptic input and glial wrapping such as have been observed in other neuroendocrine systems. The ultrastructure of GnRH neurons was studied in the preoptic area and medial basal hypothalamus of rhesus monkeys in various steroid conditions including five intact cycling, four long-term ovariectomized animals, two long-term ovariectomized animals with steroid replacement (LtOVX+), and two animals replaced with steroid at the time of ovariectomy (StOVX+). Electron micrographic montages of GnRH neuronal profiles were analyzed using computerized morphometrics, and the percentages of the length of perikaryal membrane immediately apposed by glial processes and that with postsynaptic modification were calculated. Ovariectomy resulted in a significant increase in the apposition of glial processes to GnRH perikaryal membranes and a significant decrease in their innervation in both brain regions. There was also a higher incidence of GnRH neurons with immunostaining confined to secretory granules and a decrease in the volume of nucleoli, both of which could be interpreted as indications that GnRH peptide synthesis was reduced in ovariectomized animals. After an ovarian steroid replacement regimen which mimicked two menstrual cycles, the innervation of GnRH neurons was increased and the glial ensheathment was partially reduced. This was true for both the LtOVX+ and StOVX+ steroid-replacement groups. GnRH neurons in the medial basal hypothalamus received more synaptic input than did those in the preoptic area, regardless of the steroid condition of the animal. The degree of glial ensheathment of GnRH neurons in the preoptic area became significantly greater than that in the medial basal hypothalamus after ovariectomy. These observations suggest there may be differences in the role of GnRH neurons in these two brain regions. These immunocytochemical ultrastructural studies provide strong evidence that alterations in the gonadal steroid milieu can produce morphological changes in the GnRH neuron and its immediate environment in the primate.\r"

Previous studies have shown that the cessation of penile growth is associated with a decrease in the quantity of androgen receptor, as detected by ligand binding and immunological methods. In the current studies we demonstrate that the decreased androgen receptor levels correlate with a decrease in androgen receptor mRNA content in the penile corpus and os, but not in the glans penis. These findings suggest that modulation of androgen receptor mRNA levels in the body of the penis may be important to the control of androgen-dependent growth in the tissue, and that the control of androgen receptor mRNA levels differs among the different cell types that comprise the penis. To explore the mechanisms controlling androgen receptor expression, we examined the transcription initiation site of the rat androgen receptor gene in ventral prostate and in three compartments of the penis: the corpus, the urethra, and the glans penis. The same promoter is employed in all preparations, suggesting that the different patterns of androgen receptor mRNA expression in these tissues with age are controlled by factors that modulate the activity of the same promoter.\r"

  ".W": "Dopamine inhibits prolactin liberation acting via the D2 type receptor. Two different electrophysiological responses to dopamine have been shown to characterise two types of lactotroph isolated from the lactating female rat. It is now known that differential splicing of the pre-messenger RNA coding for the D2 receptor leads to the production of two D2 subtypes, D2(415) and D2(444). These subtypes differ in the region which is believed to be responsible for the binding of G proteins, and could thus lead to the activation of different intracellular second messenger systems. Here we show that the pre-messenger RNA for the D2 receptor is differentially spliced in such a way that the ratio D2(415)/D2(444) is significantly different (2.91 +/- 0.6 vs 1.29 +/- 0.14) between two populations of lactotrophs, each enriched in cells showing one type of response to DA. We further show that the ratio D2(415)/D2(444) can be changed by treatment of prolactin cells in primary culture with progesterone or testosterone. Estrogen did not change the ratio, but diminished the total amount of D2 cDNA. Regulation of differential splicing by sex steroids could provide a mechanism for modifying lactotroph responsiveness to DA in different physiological situations.\r"

In rats, high concentrations of CNP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) were detected in the anterior lobe (19.8 +/- 8.6 pmol/g) and neurointermediate lobe (4.64 +/- 0.74 pmol/g) of the pituitary gland. CNP-LI was present throughout the brain with its high concentrations in the hypothalamus and cerebellum. Small amounts of CNP-LI were also detected in the lower part of gastrointestinal tract and the kidney. However, no significant amount of CNP-LI was present in other organs including the heart. Considerable amounts of CNP-LI were detected throughout the human brain. High performance-gel permeation chromatography coupled with the RIA detected two peaks of CNP-LI in the rat brain; CNP and presumably its N-terminally elongated form with 53 amino-acid residues, CNP-53. These findings indicate that the tissue distribution and processing pattern of CNP are clearly different from those of atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide and suggest possible roles of CNP as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator rather than as a cardiac hormone.\r"

Corticotropin-releasing activity was assessed with cultured dissociated ovine anterior pituitary cells in vitro and in sheep in vivo. Compared to vasopressin, the analog is a weak agonist at antidiuretic receptors (1/381 compared to AVP); it is a weak antagonist of the vasoconstrictor response (pA2 = 6.22). Nonetheless, the analog is a full, relatively potent agonist at pituitary corticotrope receptors (relative potency of 1/36). These data indicate that analogs of vasopressin can be synthesized which are relatively selective for agonist activity at pituitary vasopressin receptors, and in doing so, further support the contention that the pituitary receptor is quite distinct from the classical V1 receptor.\r"

In rats given intraventricular endothelin, glucose metabolism was also increased significantly in pars nervosa (+92%).

They were located within the cytoplasm of adrenomedullary cells neighbouring chromaffin vesicles, rough endoplasmic reticulum and the characteristic elongated mitochondria of chromaffin cells with laminar cristae. The mitochondria-like structures could be clearly differentiated from the extracellularly located synaptic endings. It can therefore be concluded that some rare cortico-chromaffin hybrid cells or chromaffin cells that present a mitochondrial-endoplasmic system of adrenocortical cells exist within the adrenal medulla.

Tissues for RNA extraction were obtained from euthyroid and thyroidectomized rats and from thyroidectomized rats treated with a single dose of thyroxine. Thyroidectomy resulted in significant decreases in beta 1AR and beta 2AR mRNAs in heart and lung and alpha 1BAR mRNA in liver, whereas the levels of beta 2AR mRNA in liver and alpha 1BAR mRNA in heart and lung were significantly increased. All these changes were reversed within 20 hours of a single s.c. injection of 1 mg/kg thyroxine. These findings indicate for the first time that thyroid state regulates mRNA levels for adrenergic receptors, and that this regulation is tissue- and receptor-specific. The changes in adrenergic receptor mRNAs correlate with and probably underlie the well documented, thyroid-dependent changes in the cellular densities and physiological reactivities of adrenergic receptors.\r"

In other incubations, we found that the presence of laminin in the underlying substrate was critical in promoting proliferation and elongation of gonocytes.

  ".W": "Leukotriene B4 is one of a number of agents which stimulate bone resorption by acting on osteoblasts. Some agonists, such as PTH or prostaglandins, are known to activate adenylate cyclase in osteoblasts, whereas others, such as vitamin D3, have no effect on adenylate cyclase. Recent evidence suggests that both classes of agonist may raise the intracellular calcium concentration, although the relative importance for bone resorption of calcium mobilization and adenylate cyclase activity in the osteoblast is not clear. Here it is shown 1) that leukotriene B4 does not activate but may be inhibitory toward adenylate cyclase in intact osteoblasts or membrane preparations, 2) that leukotriene B4 causes an elevation of intracellular calcium levels in osteoblast monolayers, 3) leukotriene B4 rapidly activates phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate breakdown in osteoblast membranes and intact osteoblasts, and 4) that leukotriene B4 stimulates phosphatidylinositol kinase activity concurrently with phosphoinositidase C in intact osteoblasts over a similar timescale. These results suggest that leukotriene B4 may increase the concentration of intracellular calcium in osteoblasts by stimulating phosphoinositide turnover, and support the proposal that calcium signaling rather than activation of adenylate cyclase in osteoblasts may be of overriding importance in the regulation of bone resorption.\r"

  ".U": "91309535\r", 
  ".W": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is a 9-kDa polypeptide that was initially isolated from rat brain and subsequently found to be present in several peripheral tissues. DBI is particularly abundant in steroidogenic tissues, such as the adrenal glands and testes, which also contain a high concentration of peripheral/mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBRs). Because occupancy of adrenal MBRs with DBI results in increased steroidogenesis, we have investigated the relation between ACTH, DBI, and the MBR in the rat adrenal glands. Evidence presented here indicates that both the amount of DBI and its rate of synthesis in the adrenal cortex are under the control of ACTH. Seven and 9 days after hypophysectomy, the amount of DBI-like immunoreactivity (DBI-LI) in rat adrenal glands decreased dramatically from approximately 80 to 15 ng/mg tissue. The administration of single dose of ACTH (ACTH residues 1-39; 200 mU/kg, iv) or repeated doses of ACTH-R (ACTH in saline containing 16% gelatin; 15 U/kg, sc, twice daily) reduced the decrease in adrenal DBI-LI caused by hypophysectomy. In hypophysectomized rats (7 days after hypophysectomy) the increases in both adrenal DBI-LI and plasma corticosterone induced by ACTH 1 h after a single injection (200 mU/kg, iv) were inhibited by injection of cycloheximide (40 mg/kg, ip) 10 min after ACTH. However, cycloheximide at this dose had no effect on the ACTH-induced increase in adrenal cAMP concentration or the number of affinity of MBRs for 4'-[3H]chlorodiazepam.\r"

  ".U": "91309537\r", 
  ".W": "The purpose of this research was to characterize the localization of follistatin mRNA and protein in the adult rat ovary during the 4-day estrous cycle. Analysis of ovarian sections using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of follistatin messenger RNA (mRNA) and its protein in granulosa and luteal cells; no follistatin (message or protein) was detected in any of the other ovarian cell types. An important observation was that the intensity of follistatin signals changed during granulosa differentiation and the estrous cycle. During folliculogenesis, the first detectable hybridization signal appeared in the granulosa cells of secondary follicles, but the signal was weak. However, when a preantral follicle reached the early tertiary stage (beginning antrum formation), the message signal was very strong, being expressed in all granulosa cells of all such follicles (300-400 microns in diameter). In atretic follicles, follistatin mRNA was localized to granulosa cells, but only during the early stages. The above hybridization pattern of follistatin mRNA in prenatral and atretic follicles appeared constant throughout the estrous cycle. Interestingly, immunohistochemistry studies showed that the follistatin protein was detected only in certain follicles, being restricted to those which were healthy. On the morning of estrus, the follistatin protein was localized to a subpopulation of early tertiary follicles, presumably the dominant follicles selected to ovulate in the next cycle. As the dominant preovulatory follicles matured through diestrus and proestrus, the follistatin mRNA and protein signals appeared more intense in the granulosa cells. After ovulation, the hybridization and immunohistochemical signals continued to be strong in the newly formed corpora lutea on estrus morning. After luteolysis on diestrus-I, neither the follistatin message nor the protein was detectable in the corpora lutea. In conclusion, these results suggest that the follistatin message is present in all the granulosa cells of every developing follicle throughout the estrous cycle, but the follistatin protein appears to be present in only the selected dominant follicles. Accordingly, the possibility that follistatin might be an important regulatory molecule for selection/atresia should be considered.\r"

  ".W": "Besides androgens, estrogen (E) and PRL are thought to have important roles in the regulation of the growth and function of the prostate. We have established organ cultures of rat dorsolateral prostate for the analysis of the multiple hormone actions. Explants of dorsal prostate (DP) and lateral prostate (LP) were cultured in a serum-free basal medium containing insulin and corticosterone with or without the hormones studied. The viability and overall integrity of the tissues were maintained for at least 14 days. The morphology of the explants showed castration-like changes in the basal medium, but the addition of testosterone (T) prevented them. Androgen receptors in the prostate cultured with T were demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. When the explants were grown with E the epithelium became stratified, and the cells were flat. The epithelium was also layered when the explants were grown with PRL, but the epithelial cells were hypersecretory and large. The glandular morphology of the cultured prostate was, however, best preserved if T was added along with E or PRL. The wet weights and DNA contents of the explants declined during the culture, but they were better maintained if T, E, or PRL were added to the medium. The rate of DNA labeling with [3H]thymidine was activated in the cultured explants, but it was higher in those grown with T, E, or PRL than in those grown in the basal medium. The tissue specific functions were evaluated by measuring the expression of the genes RWB and M-40.3 encoding androgen-regulated secretory proteins. The steady state levels of RWB and M-40.3 mRNA were low in the explants grown in the basal medium but in the presence of T they were high. E and PRL also increased the expression of RWB and M-40.3 messenger RNA, although the responses in DP and LP were somewhat different. The antihormones cyproterone and toremifene opposed the increase of M-40.3 messenger RNA by T and E, respectively. The results show that the cultured DP and LP of the rat maintain the androgen responsiveness and tissue-specific functions in vitro. In addition, E and PRL have androgen-independent, direct effects in them. Rat dorsolateral prostate in culture thus provides a useful model for the studies on the mechanisms of hormone regulation of the prostate.\r"

DEX completely blocked suckling-induced plasma PRL release without affecting DOMP-induced release of the hormone suggesting a central action of DEX. The effect was transient because it could not be detected on the second day of testing. The effect of DEX implanted in three different brain areas on suckling- and DOMP-induced PRL release was also tested. Implants surrounding the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei and dorsal hippocampus failed to affect PRL release induced by suckling stimulus. Surprisingly, DEX suppressed PRL release induced by suckling stimulus when it was implanted into the medial basal hypothalamus. These findings demonstrate that DEX is a potent inhibitor of the suckling-induced PRL release. They also indicate that the site of action of DEX is not at the anterior pituitary gland or the paraventricular nuclei and hippocampus because DEX treatment and DEX implants had no effect on plasma PRL levels induced by DOMP and suckling stimulus, respectively. Our data suggest that the effect of DEX is mediated through a region of the medial basal hypothalamus. The observed transient block in suckling-induced PRL release may be physiologically relevant during stress in lactating mothers for conserving pituitary stores of the hormone needed for milk production or being able to adapt to a rapid change in osmoregulation.\r"

This gene has been shown to be expressed in lymphoid cells, supporting the concept of bidirectional communication between the immune system and the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the effect of steroids and the inhibition of protein and RNA syntheses on the regulation of PEA expression in normal rat B cells. The transient expression of PEA messenger (m) RNA levels occurring normally in B cells was markedly inhibited by the presence of either 50 nM prednisolone or dexamethasone, both of which are glucocorticoids; other steroids, such as testosterone or the steroid-inactive metabolite androsterone, were ineffective. In the presence of cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, PEA mRNA was superinduced by a factor of 15-fold. Sorting by flow cytometry of cycloheximide-treated cells followed by in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the expression of PEA mRNA was exclusively confined to a small fraction of B cells. These results indicate that the mechanisms regulating PEA gene expression in B cells differ from those previously described in cells of the neuroendocrine and the nervous systems.\r"

The present studies were designed to examine the influence of EGF on intracellular pH (pHi) in chicken granulosa cells. pHi in granulosa cells from the two largest preovulatory follicles of hens was determined spectrofluorometrically using the dye 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein. The resting pHi was 6.81 +/- 0.006 (n = 30) when the extracellular pH and sodium concentration (Na+o) were 7.3 and 144 mM, respectively. EGF (5-100 ng/ml) induced a concentration-dependent increase in pHi, which reached a maximum of 0.217 +/- 0.009 pH units at a concentration of 100 ng/ml EGF. Cytosolic alkalinization was observed within 10 min of the addition of EGF and lasted over the 60 min observation period. The increase in pHi was dependent upon the presence of Na+o, since the EGF effect was attenuated when Na+o was substituted with equimolar concentrations of nonpermeant choline chloride. The EGF-induced pHi change was also inhibited by amiloride, dimethyl amiloride, and ethylisopropyl amiloride, inhibitors of the Na+/H+ antiporter. The alkalinization effect of EGF was mimicked by transforming growth factor-alpha but not by insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, or transforming growth factor-beta. These studies suggest for the first time that intracellular alkalinization resulting from activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter may be a part of the transmembrane signaling pathway in the action of EGF on chicken granulosa cells.\r"

  ".W": "Anterior pituitary POMC transcription and peptide release are negatively regulated by glucocorticoids and stimulated by CRF. Although pretreatment of corticotrope cells with CRF markedly inhibits subsequent glucocorticoid effects, the mechanism of this action is unclear. We have thus used a mouse corticotrope tumor (AtT20) cell line, to examine the effects of CRF on glucocorticoid receptor (GR) messenger RNA levels and on GR capacity/nuclear translocation. GR mRNA levels were measured by solution hybridization/S1 nuclease protection, and both total cell binding and nuclear binding were determined with [3H]dexamethasone ([3H]DEX). CRF treatment of AtT20 cells led to a rapid time-dependent decrease in GR mRNA levels which preceded a dose- and time-dependent decrease in GR binding capacity. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of high affinity binding sites (GR) in both control and CRF-treated cultures, and a decrease in the total number of GR after CRF treatment. The relative proportion of nuclear vs. cytoplasmic localized [3H]DEX-bound GR did not differ between control and CRF-treated cultures, indicating that CRF does not interfere with GR nuclear translocation. To investigate whether CRF regulates GR expression through the adenylate cyclase system, as it does POMC, AtT20 cells were treated with either forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP, and specific nuclear GR binding was determined. Both drugs mimic the CRF-induced decrease in GR binding, and in addition forskolin decreased GR mRNA levels; in contrast, forskolin had no effect on GH3 cell GR levels. These results suggest that CRF can decrease the cellular concentration of GR, and thus potentially the response to glucocorticoids, through the same mechanism by which it stimulates anterior pituitary POMC expression.\r"

Using these systems, the truncated form of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (des-3-IGF-1), IGF-1, and IGF-2 all stimulated a significant (0.5 to 1 fold) increase in cell proliferation (des-3-IGF-1 greater than IGF-1 greater than IGF-2). When grown in media containing serum plus IGF-1, normal bovine mammary cells also produced and secreted at least four species of IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) ranging from 21K to 48K (as demonstrated by ligand blot analysis). However, cells grown in serum free media secreted detectable quantities of only 2 major forms of IGFBP of 34K and 48K. Using immunoblot analysis, these proteins were identified as IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3, respectively. Both proteins were inducible by the addition of IGF to the serum free media (relative potency; IGF-1 greater than des-3-IGF-1 greater than IGF-2). Using RIA analysis, bovine mammary cells cultured in the presence of IGF-1 produced 20-25 ng/ml IGFBP-2 compared to control cultures which secrete approximately 1.0 ng/ml. Cells exposed to des-3-IGF-1 produced 40-60% less IGFBP-2 whereas insulin and IGF-2 did not stimulate significant IGFBP-2 production. These data indicate that normal bovine mammary cells secret IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3. This secretion is stimulated by IGF-1 and des-3-IGF-1 suggesting a mechanism for regulating local IGF activity.\r"

A high quality concentrate diet was available ad libitum, and individual food intake was recorded daily. The animals were weighed, bled, and the diameters of their testes were measured every 2 weeks. Plasma samples were assayed for IGF-I by RIA. Six to 8 weeks after the start of the study those calves exposed to 16L:8D showed a significant increase in plasma IGF-I concentration, which was maintained until the close 24 weeks after the start. In contrast, IGF-I plasma concentrations in those calves exposed to a day length of 8L:16D did not significantly alter during the study. The elevated IGF-I in the 16L:8D group was associated with rapid weight gain, higher food intake, and decreased testes size compared with the 8L:16D group. We have shown that the seasonal growth spurt is preceded by an elevation in plasma IGF-I concentration. Further, this elevation in IGF-I is day length dependent.

Here we show that the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 has the potential, under the appropriate culture conditions, to differentiate into cells that have morphological and functional characteristics of osteoclasts, including multinucleation, presence of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, cross-reactivity with monoclonal antibodies that preferentially recognize osteoclasts, and capacity to resorb bone and respond to calcitonin. The multinucleated cells also contain high affinity receptors to calcitonin, in contrast to wild-type undifferentiated HL-60 cells. These data suggest that osteoclasts share a common precursor with hematopoietic cells. These undifferentiated and differentiated HL-60 cells should provide a unique model for study of the cell biology of human osteoclast differentiation, allowing molecular biological and biochemical studies heretofore not possible.\r"

The peptide was found to have the following amino acid sequence: Ile Ala Leu Gly Gly Leu Leu Leu Pro Thr Ser. Gaps in the sequence that one would anticipate if delta 6-testosterone formed an adduct with a single amino acid were not encountered. Several different amino acids appear to have been labeled as expected given the free radical nature of photoactivated delta 6-testosterone. The sequence obtained corresponded to a tryptic peptide (amino acids 171-181) of the rABP precursor. The only other protein having this amino acid sequence was human sex hormone binding globulin. The binding domain lies in a hydrophobic pocket that contains a predicted beta-sheet and turn secondary structure, as would be anticipated given the hydrophobic nature of the steroid molecule. A hydropathy and secondary structure analysis of rABP was performed as a basis for discussing the results of the current study in relation to previous studies on the steroid binding domain on human sex hormone binding globulin.\r"

  ".W": "Expression of the gene for the porcine transplacental iron transport protein uteroferrin (UF) is largely restricted to the uterus, where it is differentially regulated by estrogen (E) and progesterone (P). To study the regulatory mechanisms subserving these effects, a 2-kilobase genomic fragment corresponding to -2005 to 48 nucleotides of the UF gene was ligated up-stream to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). This construct (UF-CAT) was transiently transfected into rabbit endometrial (HRE-H9), mouse fibroblastic (AKR-2B), and human choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cells. The basal gene promoter activity of UF-CAT was exhibited in H9 cells, but not in AKR-2B or JEG-3 cells. In contrast, a simian virus-40 early promoter (SV2) was functional in all three cell lines. The H9 cells were used to examine steroid regulation of the UF gene promoter. The CAT expression in H9 cells primed with E and PRL, but not with E or PRL alone, was stimulated by P. In contrast, basal activity of SV2 in these cells was unaffected by hormones, singly or in combination. To examine the basis for the E/PRL-dependent response to P, levels of P and E receptors in H9 cells were quantified. PRL and E plus PRL increased the number of high affinity sites for P, but had little effect on levels of high affinity sites for E in treated vs. untreated H9 cells. In vivo administration of PRL to cyclic gilts had no effect on levels of endometrial UF mRNA and secreted UF protein; however, E- plus PRL-treated gilts had higher (P less than 0.05) levels of endometrial UF mRNA and luminal UF than PRL-treated gilts. These results demonstrate in vitro functional activity of the UF gene promoter and associated 5' flanking region and suggest that sequences within this region may mediate tissue-specific and steroid hormone-regulated expression of the UF gene. Moreover, interactions among E, PRL, and P modulate UF gene expression in vivo and in vitro.\r"

To determine whether retinoic acid and dexamethasone administration, alone and in combination, influence CRBP gene expression, adult female vitamin A-sufficient Sprague-Dawley rats randomly received 1) all-trans retinoic acid (100 micrograms) by intragastric intubation, 2) dexamethasone (2 micrograms/g BW) by ip injection, or 3) both all-trans retinoic acid and dexamethasone in the same doses. Control animals received either cottonseed oil by intragastric intubation or saline by ip injection. Six hours after treatment, lung and liver tissue were collected for Northern blot analysis with the radiolabeled cDNA specific for rat CRBP. Retinoic acid administration increased the amount of lung CRBP mRNA only, whereas dexamethasone decreased both lung and liver CRBP mRNA abundance. In animals treated with both retinoic acid and dexamethasone, CRBP mRNA abundance was also reduced. We conclude that CRBP gene expression can be modulated by both retinoic acid and dexamethasone in the vitamin A-sufficient animal. In the whole animal, our findings indicate that dexamethasone not only represses CRBP gene expression, but also opposes the effect of retinoic acid.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) initiates its diverse biological effects by binding to type I IGF receptors on cells. In addition, IGF-I associates with distinct proteins that can modulate its actions. One of these IGF-binding proteins, IGFBP-3, is the major circulating form in adults and is produced by many cells in culture. We investigated the effect of purified bovine IGFBP-3 on IGF-I binding and IGF-I stimulation of amino acid uptake and DNA synthesis in cultured bovine fibroblasts, a cell culture system highly suitable for these types of studies. Incubation of cells with IGF-I resulted in time- and dose-dependent decreases in [125I]IGF-I binding and IGF-I stimulated [3H]aminoisobutyric acid uptake and [3H]thymidine incorporation. Preincubation with 4 nM IGF-I resulted in a 50-60% decrease in IGF-I receptor binding, accompanied by marked decreases in IGF-I-stimulated [3H]aminoisobutyric acid uptake (50-60%) and [3H]thymidine incorporation (80-90%). Preincubation with the IGF-I analog [QAYL]IGF-I (4 nM) or with 100 nM insulin, growth factors that bind and activate type I IGF receptor signalling but have little or no affinity for IGFBP-3, had effects comparable to IGF-I, decreasing both IGF-I binding and action 50-95%. The addition of IGFBP-3 during the preincubation period with IGF-I blocked the decrease in receptor availability and prevented the cells from becoming desensitized. IGFBP-3 did not prevent the [QAYL]IGF-I- or insulin-induced receptor loss and cellular resistance to IGF-I. These data indicate that IGFBP-3 can prevent IGF-I-induced receptor down-regulation, a process that renders cells refractory to further stimulation by IGF-I. Thus, cell-derived IGFBP-3 may function in a buffering capacity to restrict IGF-I and target cell interaction, thereby modulating the biological response to changes in local IGF-I levels.\r"

  ".W": "The primary objective underlying hormone treatment of prostatic adenocarcinoma is to induce an effective androgen deprivation, and high dose estrogen therapy is as effective as surgical castration in abolishing the growth-promoting effects of androgens on prostatic tissue. An estradiol-chemical delivery system (E2-CDS), with sustained release of E2 in the brain, may be potentially useful in the treatment of prostatic cancer by virtue of the need for lower or less frequent doses of the estrogen. In this study we evaluated the dose- and time-dependent effects of the E2-CDS vs. 17 beta-E2 on serum testosterone (T) and weights of androgen-dependent tissues in male rats. Rats received a single iv injection of E2-CDS (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg), equimolar doses of 17 beta-E2, or the drug's vehicle. Sera and tissues were collected 1, 7, 14, or 21 days later for determination of hormone levels and tissue weights. The E2-CDS exhibited a dose- and time-dependent suppression of serum T and weights of the ventral prostate and seminal vesicles. In contrast, 17 beta-E2 had no significant effect on serum T or growth of these androgen-dependent tissues. Serum T levels were significantly reduced by 98%, 82%, and 59% at 1, 7, and 14 days, respectively, with the 1.0 mg/kg dose of E2-CDS. The E2-CDS significantly reduced prostate weight by 45% and 50% (1.0- and 0.5-mg/kg doses, respectively) 7 days and by 27% (0.5 mg/kg dose) 14 days after treatment. Similarly, seminal vesicle weights were reduced by 14-20% on day 1, maximally reduced by 39-48% on day 7, and still reduced by 24-36% on day 14 compared with the control levels. Weights of these tissues returned to control levels by day 21. Serum E2 was elevated through 7 days by E2-CDS or on day 1 only by 17 beta-E2. PRL secretion was stimulated for 1 week by both forms of estrogen. Anterior pituitary weights were increased by the E2-CDS through 14 days, while 17 beta-E2 had no significant effect. These data indicate that the E2-CDS causes chronic suppression of serum T, which subsequently results in regression of androgen-dependent tissue weight.\r"

Also, the role of serum T in the weight reduction of androgen-dependent tissues observed after E2-CDS treatment was further evaluated in these studies. Intact male rats received a single iv injection of either E2-CDS at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg or an equimolar dose of E2-BNZ (0.95 mg/kg). Sera and tissue samples were collected 1, 7, 14, or 21 days after injection for determination of hormones and tissue weights. A single injection of E2-CDS suppressed serum T levels by 96%, 83%, 46%, or 63% 1, 7, 14, or 21 days after treatment, respectively. In contrast, an equimolar dose of E2-BNZ had no significant effect on serum T at any sampling time examined. Prostate weight was maximally reduced by 53% at 7 days and remained significantly suppressed by more than 31% throughout the 21-day time course. Similarly, seminal vesicle weight was reduced by 14% on day 1, maximally reduced by 41% on day 7 and remained significantly suppressed through day 21. In contrast, E2-BNZ was ineffective in inducing weight changes in either of these tissues. Serum PRL was significantly elevated through day 14, while E2 was elevated through day 7 by E2-CDS. Both the anterior pituitary and adrenal gland weights were stimulated by E2-CDS treatment. Testis weight was moderately reduced by both esters. In a subsequent study serum T was reduced by 98% and 97% 1 and 7 days, respectively, after E2-CDS treatment, and weights of the ventral prostate and seminal vesicle were reduced by 47% and 40%, respectively, at 7 days. In contrast, in rats treated with Silastic capsules containing T, the expected E2-CDS-induced weight regression was prevented in both prostate and seminal vesicles. These data indicate that the prolonged effects of E2-CDS on weights of androgen-dependent tissues are caused by its ability to produce profound suppression of the serum T concentration.\r"

  ".W": "The intracellular distribution and molecular heterogeneity of carboxypeptidase H was studied in rat insulinoma tissue and isolated islets of Langerhans by a combination of immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, subcellular fractionation, and immunoblotting analyses. Immunofluorescence microscopy of islets demonstrated the presence of carboxypeptidase H in both insulin-containing B cells and glucagon-containing A cells. Quantitative ultrastructural analyses of islet B cells indicated that the enzyme was concentrated in mature insulin secretory granules, clathrin-coated condensing granules, and to a lesser extent the Golgi apparatus. Carboxypeptidase H activity was localized principally to secretory granule subfractions of insulinoma tissue, where it was present for the major part (70%) as a form which is readily solubilizable at pH values prevailing in the granule interior (5.5). This species migrated as a diffuse band of 53-57 kilodaltons (kDa) on immunoblot analysis using antisera raised against the purified native enzyme. In contrast, the insoluble form which was associated with the granule membrane at pH 5.5, migrated as a relatively compact band of 55-57 kDa. Carboxypeptidase H activity was also present in subcellular fractions which contained Golgi membranes together with elements of the endoplasmic reticulum, and in a low density secretory granule fraction which may represent immature granules. The enzyme in these compartments, like the granule membrane species, migrated as a compact 55-57 kDa band on immunoblots. Two-dimensional electrophoretic immunoblot analysis of secretory granules suggested that both membrane and soluble forms of the enzyme were glycoproteins and that the terminal glycosylation was similar in both instances. Antiserum raised against the deduced C-terminal 11 amino acids of the cloned carboxypeptidase H sequence recognized the 55-57 kDa membrane component in granules but did not react with the 53-57 kDa soluble species. A major difference between the soluble and membrane forms therefore appears to be a structural modification or proteolytic removal of the C-terminal domain in the trans-Golgi or early secretory granule compartment. The concept that proteolysis is involved is further supported by the observation that the relative proportion of the high and low mol wt forms of the enzyme in different subcellular fractions correlated with that of proinsulin and insulin, respectively. The membrane association of the 55-57 kDa form of carboxypeptidase H is disrupted at pH values of 9 and is dependent on ionic strength. This further suggests that the C-terminus of the protein may have an important role in the sorting or concentration of the enzyme in vesicular elements of the regulated pathway of secretion.\r"

The androgen dependency of testicular descent was studied in the rat using an antiandrogen (flutamide) and an inhibitor of the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase (finasteride). Androgen receptor blockade inhibited testicular descent more effectively than inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase activity. Moreover, its inhibitory effect was limited to the outgrowth phase of the gubernaculum testis, particularly the earliest stages of outgrowth. Gubernacular size was also significantly reduced in fetuses exposed to flutamide during the outgrowth period. In contrast, androgen receptor blockade or 5 alpha-reductase inhibition applied after the initiation of gubernacular outgrowth or during the regression phase did not affect testicular descent. Successful inhibition of the development of epididymis and vas by prenatal flutamide did not correlate with ipsilateral testicular maldescent, suggesting that an intact epididymis is not required for descent of the testis. Plasma androgen assays confirmed significant inhibition of dihydrotestosterone formation in finasteride-treated rats. These data suggest that androgens, primarily testosterone, are required during the early phases of gubernacular outgrowth for subsequent successful completion of testicular descent.\r"

  ".U": "91309556\r", 
  ".W": "In men and adult male rhesus monkeys brief periods of fasting (i.e. 1-2 days) can often lead to a suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis activity, marked by decreased circulating concentrations of LH, FSH, and testosterone. Refeeding a normal meal can rapidly restore normal secretory patterns of LH and testosterone. To learn more about the nature of the signal that links reproductive hormone secretion to nutrient intake, we examined whether the degree of restoration of pulsatile LH and testosterone secretion after a brief period of fasting is influenced by the size of the refeed meal. Adult male rhesus monkeys had indwelling venous catheters surgically implanted and were maintained on swivel/tether systems for remote collection of blood samples. Monkeys were fasted for 1 day and then on the following day they were refed one of five meals which varied in size and calorie content (i.e. 0 Cal/0 pellets Purina monkey chow; 100 Cal/5 pellets; 200 Cal/10 pellets; 300 Cal/15 pellets; or 600 Cal/30 pellets). Blood samples were collected from 0800-2400 h at 20-min intervals on the days of refeeding and assayed for LH and testosterone content. After a day of fasting, the frequency of pulsatile LH secretion the following morning was very low (0.56 +/- 0.1 pulses/3 h, measured from 0800-1100 h). When monkeys were not refed (i.e. were subjected to a second day of fasting; 0 pellet group) LH pulse frequency remained low [2.88 +/- 0.72 pulses/13 h, measured from 1100-2400 h (equivalent to 0.66 pulses/3 h)] throughout the day and evening hours. Refeeding monkeys 5, 10, 15, and 30 pellets caused a progressive stimulation of pulsatile LH secretion (3.17 +/- 0.54, 3.67 +/- 0.56, 5.5 +/- 0.67, and 6.38 +/- 0.53 pulses/13 h, respectively). Like LH pulse frequency, mean circulating LH and testosterone concentrations progressively increased as the size of the refeed meal was increased. For all three parameters (i.e. LH pulse frequency, mean LH concentration, and mean testosterone concentration) there was a significant, P less than or equal to 0.001, linear trend with increasing meal size. These findings indicate a very strong relation between the level of nutritional intake and the level of central drive to the reproductive axis during nutritional recovery from fasting, and suggest a physiological parameter that responds in a progressive fashion to increasing food intake serves as the signal to link central drive to the reproductive axis to changes in nutrient intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Immunohistochemical techniques, Western blot analysis, and a RIA with antisera raised against synthetic fragments of human (h) PTHrP (i.e. 1-34, 1-40, 50-69, and 107-141) were used to detect the presence of immunoreactive PTHrP in parathyroid glands from fetal and neonatal lambs and maternal ewes. Positive immunostaining for PTHrP was observed in fetal (from 116 days of gestation) and lamb (up to 180 days post birth) but not maternal parathyroid glands with the PTHrP(50-69) antiserum. Fetal and lamb parathyroid glands consisted entirely of one cell type in which PTHrP immunoreactivity to PTHrP(50-69) antiserum was found. In contrast, immunoreactivity to PTHrP could not be detected in sections of fetal, lamb, or maternal parathyroid glands with antisera raised against PTHrP(1-34) or PTHrP(107-141). However, PTHrP immunoreactivity in urea/acid extracts of newborn lamb parathyroid glands could be detected by Western blot analysis and RIA with antisera raised against the N-terminal portion of PTHrP. Western blot analysis with the PTHrP(1-34) antisera revealed that urea/acid extracts of newborn lamb parathyroid glands contained a substance with a mol wt of 14.4K, which corresponded in size to that of hPTHrP(1-84). Newborn lamb parathyroid glands contained 0.35 ng PTHrP/micrograms extract, whereas maternal parathyroid glands contained only 0.035 ng PTHrP/micrograms extract when tested in a RIA employing recombinant hPTHrP(1-84) as standard and an antibody raised against hPTHrP(1-40). The detection of immunoreactive PTHrP in the developing ovine parathyroid gland provides further evidence to support the suggestion that PTHrP produced in the parathyroid gland is involved in the normal hormonal regulation of calcium metabolism in the mammalian fetus and neonate.\r"

Cross-bred beef cattle were bred by artificial insemination. An indwelling cannula was inserted into a jugular vein on day 269 (expected term = day 283) for repeated blood sample collection. On day 277, the cattle were assigned randomly to three groups (n = 6 each): group 1 received RU 486 (2 mg/kg BW, im) at 0800 h on days 277 and 278; group 2 received the same RU 486 treatment plus 3000 U relaxin, injected sc at 0800 h on day 278; and group 3 served as controls and received vehicle injection. Parturition occurred 55 h after treatment in group 1 and 53 h after treatment in group 2 compared with 210 h in the controls (P less than 0.01). The calves from treated groups were vigorous at birth, and their birth weights (32 and 33 kg in groups 1 and 2) were less than those of control calves (38 kg; P less than 0.01). There was no incidence of difficult birth (dystocia) with RU 486 treatment compared with that in the controls. Placenta delivery averaged 6.5 h after birth in both RU 486-treated groups and did not differ from the control value (5 h). Plasma progesterone concentrations averaged 8.2 ng/ml during the pretreatment period for all animals. Progesterone started to decrease markedly by 1200 h on day 278, dropped to about 4 ng/ml by 2400 h that same day, and was at basal levels on day 279, the day of calving, in two hormone-treated groups. In sharp contrast, progesterone was maintained at about 6 ng/ml in placebo-treated controls during this period and did not decrease to basal levels until 2 days before parturition on day 286 (P less than 0.01). Peak RU 486 in plasma was 7.2 ng/ml after the first injection and 14.3 ng/ml after the second injection, and averaged 7.9 ng/ml on the day of induced calving (day 279). Peak relaxin was 4.1 ng/ml after hormone injection. The results indicate that RU 486 alone or combined with relaxin precisely controlled the time of parturition in cattle in late pregnancy. Such treatment can be used to facilitate parturition and increase survival rates of neonatal calves without detrimental effects of dystocia, retention of placenta, and delayed postpartum fertility.\r"

In the present study we assess levels of expression of Glut 1 and Glut 4 transporters and basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity in adipocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats fed standard chow (control), combined liquid diet and standard chow (overfed), high fat diet, or energy-restricted diet for 7 weeks. High fat feeding was associated with relative postprandial hypoglycemia (P less than 0.05) and hypoinsulinemia (P less than 0.05). Although the high fat fed animals had lower body weights (P less than 0.05) than control rats, their body compositions showed obesity, with 36% heavier epididymal fat pads (P less than 0.05) and a 47% increase in adipocyte volume (P less than 0.05). Fat feeding caused a 78% reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose transport per adipocyte (P less than 0.05). In parallel we found 92% and 94% reductions in Glut 4 protein and mRNA per adipocyte, respectively, (P less than 0.01) in fat-fed rats. Substantial reductions were also seen in Glut 1 protein and mRNA per fat cell in the same rats (62% and 76%, respectively; P less than 0.05). However, the changes in Glut 1 expression were of the same magnitude as changes in the cytoskeletal protein beta-actin, reflecting a decreased expression of several proteins in this nutritional state. Even though overfeeding and energy restriction brought about opposite changes in adiposity, no significant alterations were demonstrated in glucose transport rate or glucose transporter expression. The impaired insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipose cells from high fat-fed rats occurs in the presence of a dramatic decrease in the expression of the major insulin-responsive glucose transporter (Glut 4). The reduced gene expression may be caused by chronic hypoinsulinemia and may contribute to the insulin resistance observed in this state.\r"

  ".U": "91309560\r", 
  ".W": "22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT), a synthetic vitamin D analog, can mimic the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25-(OH)2D3] to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response and to suppress PTH secretion, but has much less calcemic activity. The mechanism for this selective action is not understood. OCT has been shown to have a diminished ability to mobilize calcium from bone in vivo, but in vitro findings are contradictory. Little is known about the effect of OCT on bone forming cells. Therefore, the present studies were designed to investigate the actions of OCT at the molecular level in the osteoblast-like cell line, ROS 17/2.8. 3H-OCT was bound to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in intact cells at the same rate as 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3. As previously found for 1,25-(OH)2D3, the time course of specific binding of OCT was biphasic, with an initial plateau at 1 h and a further increase from 2-8 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that exposure to 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3 increased VDR from 24 fmol/mg protein at 2 h to 85 fmol/mg protein at 8 h. Exposure to 3H-OCT increased VDR from 22 to 76 fmol/mg protein, indicating that OCT is also capable of up-regulating the VDR in ROS 17/2.8 cells. In contrast to the lower affinity of OCT for VDR reported for chick intestine and HL-60 cells, the Kd for OCT in intact ROS 17/2.8 cells was identical to that for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of OCT on osteocalcin secretion and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells was also determined. Pretreatment for 24 h with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of osteocalcin secretion. A 2-fold stimulation by both compounds was observed with 10(-7)M. ALP activity was measured after a 72-h incubation with 10(-7)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT. Both compounds increased ALP activity to the same extent. Stimulation by OCT of VDR levels, ALP activity, and osteocalcin secretion were inhibited by the addition of 5 microM cycloheximide, indicating that these actions of OCT require new protein synthesis. Thus, OCT, like 1,25-(OH)2D3, up-regulates the vitamin D receptor, stimulates osteocalcin secretion, and increases ALP activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells, suggesting that the analog may be as active as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in stimulating bone formation in vivo. The low activity of OCT in mobilizing calcium from bone in vivo does not appear to be due to an inability of this compound to act on osteoblasts.\r"

  ".U": "91309561\r", 
  ".W": "The inhibition of food intake in rats that results from various anorexigenic treatments is frequently associated with pituitary secretion of oxytocin (OT), but is not caused by circulating OT. We, therefore, evaluated the potential role of brain OT in mediating anorexia induced in rats by systemic administration of cholecystokinin (CCK), hypertonic saline (HS), or lithium chloride (LiCl), treatments that are known to stimulate pituitary OT secretion as well as to inhibit food intake. Food intake was analyzed in 22-h food-deprived rats pretreated with icv injections of either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or 9 nmol of an OT receptor antagonist, [d(CH2)5, Tyr(OMe)2,Orn8]vasotocin (OVT), which was the dose found to be most effective to antagonize the anorexia induced by CCK and HS. Pretreatment with the OT receptor antagonist icv significantly blunted the anorexigenic effect of each agent. After CCK (10 micrograms/kg, ip), food intake increased from 28 +/- 5% of basal intake after a CSF icv to 48 +/- 8% after OVT icv (P less than 0.01); after HS (2 ml 2 M NaCl, ip), food intake increased from 9 +/- 4% of basal intake after aCSF icv to 43 +/- 7% after OVT icv (P less than 0.01); and after LiCl (1.125 mmol/kg, ip), food intake increased from 55 +/- 4% of basal intake after a CSF icv to 80 +/- 9% after OVT icv (P less than 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that pituitary secretion of OT after anorexigenic treatments in rats is associated with coactivation of centrally projecting brain OT pathways, some of which are causally related to the induced inhibition of food intake.\r"

  ".W": "In the adult mammalian ovary morphogenesis and differentiation processes are under hormonal control and, thus, occur in a highly regulated way during the sexual cycle. Cell-cell interactions, such as cell adhesion and cell separation, are crucial during these events. Here we show that the ovarian endocrine cells, which are prototypes of steroid-producing cells, express neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs). The combined use of in situ hybridization histochemistry, immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels, S1 nuclease protection assays, and Western blotting revealed that in the ovary of the adult rat during the estrus cycle and pregnancy, NCAM mRNA and the 140-kDa isoform of this protein are expressed mainly in granulosa cells of growing preantral and antral follicles and in corpora lutea. Since the granulosa cells lining the forming antrum and the antral fluid were strongly immunoreactive, a role for NCAM in the formation of the follicular antrum is proposed. The expression of NCAM was also associated with luteal cells of the active corpus luteum, indicating a role for NCAM in the morphogenesis of this endocrine compartment. Moreover, thecal cells of large follicles and hypertrophic thecal cells of atretic follicles expressed NCAM, as did interstitial cells, which are derived from thecal cells of atretic follicles. We propose that the adhesion molecule, NCAM, is an important factor involved in the recognition and intercellular interaction of ovarian endocrine cells and, thus, participates in the regulation of the cyclic remodeling processes of the ovarian endocrine compartments.\r"

  ".U": "91309564\r", 
  ".W": "Lithium has been reported to alter thyroid function and cause goiter in some patients. To explain the mechanism of lithium action in the thyroid gland, we studied the effect of lithium on thyroid function and cell growth in FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells and on de novo thyroid hormone formation in primary cultures of porcine thyroid follicles. TSH-induced iodide uptake was suppressed at 2 mM lithium in both FRTL-5 cells and porcine follicles. In porcine thyroid follicles, iodide uptake stimulated by 8-bromo-cAMP, iodine organification, and de novo thyroid hormone formation were also reduced by lithium; however, 2 mM lithium did not inhibit TSH-induced cAMP production. In FRTL-5 cells, lithium also inhibited forskolin-stimulated iodide uptake. These results suggested that lithium exerts its effect at a step involving cAMP signal transduction rather than inhibiting cAMP production. In both FRTL-5 thyroid cells and porcine follicles, lithium enhanced cell growth in basal states (lacking TSH) and with TSH treatment. In porcine thyroid cells, the protein kinase C activator, tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate, increased cell growth, and lithium had an additive effect with tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate on cell growth. To examine the possibility that the action of lithium was mediated by the protein kinase C pathway, porcine cells were incubated with lithium and H7, a selective protein kinase C inhibitor. Lithium-induced cell growth was suppressed to the basal level by H7. These results suggest that lithium exerts its growth-promoting effect through the protein kinase C system.\r"

  ".W": "The cells of the adrenal cortex contain angiotensin-II (AII), but whether this peptide is synthesized there (vs. internalized from the systemic circulation), whether it is secreted, and whether it is important in aldosterone production remain uncertain. To address these issues, we studied AI and AII release from superfused rat adrenal capsules and dispersed glomerulosa cells. Superfused adrenal capsules released 7-fold more AII in 270 min than the capsules originally contained (495 +/- 101 fmol AII/rat released vs. 66 +/- 8 fmol AII/rat tissue content). The amount of AI released in the same period only slightly exceeded the tissue content. In response to higher potassium concentrations in the medium (9 vs. 3.6 mM K+), adrenal capsules and dispersed glomerulosa cells both released significantly more AI and AII into the superfusate. This release of AI and AII was oscillatory. The oscillations occurred in each of 15 experiments, with a period of 45-90 min. Decapsulated adrenal glands (the zona faciculata/reticularis plus medulla) also contained and released AII, but did not respond to potassium stimulation. There was a highly significant correlation between AII and aldosterone release. This was especially apparent if aldosterone secretion was examined during oscillations of AII release (r = 0.97; P less than 0.0001). We conclude that AII is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa and can be released in response to stimuli. The close correlation between AII and aldosterone secretion suggests that locally produced AII may play an important role in aldosterone biosynthesis.\r"

  ".U": "91309567\r", 
  ".W": "Although 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] has been shown to inhibit the growth of certain malignant cells, its hypercalcemic effect has prevented clinical application. We have recently developed a novel vitamin D3 analog, 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), that is capable of promoting differentiation and inhibiting proliferation without inducing hypercalcemia. The present study was undertaken to determine whether OCT could be applied for the treatment of breast cancer with or without estrogen receptor (ER). OCT inhibited the proliferation of both ER-positive (MCF-7, T-47D, and ZR-75-1) and ER-negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and BT-20) in vitro in a time- and dose-dependent manner, as determined by cell number and [3H]thymidine uptake. The antiproliferative effect was observed with a concentration as low as 10(-11) M OCT, and treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10(-8) M OCT for 8 days caused more than a 50% reduction in cell number compared with that of vehicle-treated cells. OCT was approximately 1 order of magnitude more potent than 1,25-(OH)2D3 in inhibiting the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. The in vivo effect of OCT was examined in athymic mice implanted with ER-negative MX-1 tumor, which was established as the xenograft derived from human breast carcinoma. Intratumor administration of OCT three times a week remarkably delayed the growth of MX-1 tumor in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The antitumor effect of 1 microgram/kg BW OCT was greater than that of 500 microgram/kg BW adriamycin, and the relative tumor weights in each group on day 26 were 29.7% and 50.5% of that in the vehicle-treated group, respectively. The effects of OCT and adriamycin were additive, and the relative tumor weight after 26 days of combined treatment was 21.7% of that in the vehicle-treated group. Oral administration of OCT was also effective, and the relative tumor weight in the OCT-treated group (1 microgram/kg BW) was 54.6 +/- 0.1% (mean +/- SEM) of that in the vehicle-treated group. Neither intratumor nor oral administration of OCT raised the serum calcium level in these animals. These results demonstrate that OCT is a potent inhibitor of the proliferation of breast cancer cells with or without ER and that OCT inhibits the growth of breast cancer in vivo without inducing hypercalcemia. We suggest that OCT may provide a new strategy for the treatment of breast carcinoma regardless of ER status.\r"

  ".U": "91309569\r", 
  ".W": "Mounting evidence indicates that dopamine (DA) can stimulate as well as inhibit PRL release when given in appropriately low doses. In the present study, we investigated whether the suckling stimulus could influence this response. Pituitary cultures from suckled or nonsuckled rats were exposed to DA (10(-16) - 10(-6) M) during a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for PRL. Pituitary cells from nonsuckled rats exhibited only the inhibitory response to DA; exposure to high-dose DA (10(-6) M) reduced plaque area to 42.3 +/- 7.2% (mean +/- SEM) of control. A low dose of DA (10(-12) M) had no effect on PRL secretion (79.3 +/- 13.3% of control). In striking contrast, a brief suckling stimulus (10 min) rendered the mammotropes responsive to stimulation by low-dose DA (to 152.7 +/- 12.5% of control). Thus, suckling appears to be a requirement for expression of the stimulatory effect of DA in lactators. In a subsequent series of experiments we explored the possibility that a hypophysial factor, released during nursing, might mimic the effects of suckling on mammotrope responsiveness. Accordingly, we tested the effects of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (10(-7) M) and low-dose DA, alone or in combination, on pituitary cells from nonsuckled rats. Although neither agent alone had a dramatic effect on PRL secretion, concurrent administration of both of these significantly stimulated PRL release to 130.0 +/- 4.2% of control. Taken together, these results demonstrate that suckling renders mammotropes responsive to the stimulatory effects of DA. Moreover, our data indicate that alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone could function as a responsiveness factor in this phenomenon.\r"

  ".U": "91309570\r", 
  ".W": "The acute effect (24 h) of either phosphate depletion or phosphate surfeit on hormonal stimulated signal transduction systems was studied in the osteoblastic cell line UMR-106. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in), induced by different calciotropic hormones (PTH, prostaglandin E2, endothelin) was blunted by acute phosphate depletion, whereas at high inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations the rise in [Ca2+]in was augmented. Basal [Ca2+]in was not altered by either Pi depletion or Pi excess. The effect of acute phosphate depletion on hormonal mediated [Ca2+]in rise was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ suggesting that under these conditions, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is not affected. Also, nonhormonal calcium entry pathways such as depolarization-activated calcium channels or protein kinase C-activated Ca2+ channels were not affected by acute phosphate depletion. cAMP accumulation in the cells, either through receptor or nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms, increased under low Pi conditions and decreased as Pi concentration in the culture media was progressively increased from 0 to 2 mM during 24 h of incubation. Changes in Pi concentration had no effect on basal cAMP generation by the cells. The facilitative effect of acute Pi depletion on agonist-induced cAMP accumulation could be demonstrated in both the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.2 mM). PTH receptor binding assessed with [Nle8 Nle18 Tyr34] bovine PTH (1-34) NH2 was not altered by phosphate depletion. We conclude that exposure of osteoblasts to different Pi environments modulates the second messenger responses to hormones in a reciprocal fashion so that acute phosphate depletion down-regulates [Ca2+]in signals while augmenting cAMP generation and vice versa. Inasmuch as bone resorption processes can be modulated by Ca2+ and cAMP the data presented herein suggest that the altered bone resorptive response to calciotropic hormones (e.g. PTH), under surfeit or deficit of phosphate, is mediated by changes in [Ca2+]in and cAMP.\r"

Ion exchange and reverse phase tissue extraction procedures were combined with reverse phase HPLC to achieve complete purification of each form of JP. Fragments resulting from tryptic hydrolysis of each form were characterized by amino acid analysis and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The predominant form of human JP, accounting for about 50% of the total purified, was found to be conjugated to glutathione through the lone cysteine residue at position 9. The other two variants were identified as human JP with a free cysteine residue and human JP dimer and accounted for 35% and 15%, respectively, of the total purified. Recently, human JP-(1-18) has been suggested as having adrenal androgen-stimulating activity. None of the three JP variants or their respective 1-20 amino-terminal fragments resulting from tryptic hydrolysis showed any ability to promote the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate by cultured human fetal adrenal cells. Similarly, no potentiation of the stimulatory effects of ACTH-(1-39) was observed. The three variants of human JP as well as JP purified from rat, porcine, and bovine pituitaries were tested for their ability to stimulate androgenic steroids from dispersed fetal rabbit adrenal cells. None showed any significant biological activity either in stimulating steroid secretion or in potentiating the action of ACTH-(1-39).\r"

In the present study regulation of expression of PTH receptors of the chondrocytes by various growth and differentiation factors and its relation to the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG), a differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes, were investigated. Treatment with retinoic acid decreased GAG synthesis in cultured chondrocytes and the number of PTH receptors, measured by binding of [125I]-[Nle8,18,Tyr34]bovine PTH-(1-34) amide to the cells. However, the affinity of the receptors did not change. The decrease in the number of PTH receptors was dose and time dependent and parallel to the decrease in GAG synthesis. When chondrocytes that had been treated with retinoic acid were cultured in the absence of retinoic acid for 3 days, both their GAG synthesis and their number of PTH receptors were restored. Epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor also decreased both the number of PTH receptors and GAG synthesis in the cells. However, these treatments did not change their affinity. Treatment with insulin-like growth factor-I, (Bu)2cAMP, and transforming growth factor-beta resulted in increases in GAG synthesis as well as in the number of PTH receptors without any change in their affinity. In addition, the PTH-stimulated cAMP level in chondrocytes pretreated with retinoic acid, epidermal growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor was lower than that in control cells. On the other hand, the PTH-stimulated cAMP level in chondrocytes pretreated with insulin-like growth factor-I and transforming growth factor-beta was higher than that in control cells. These observations suggest that the increase in the number of PTH receptors on chondrocytes is closely related to expression of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes and that the number of the receptors is a good marker of the differentiated phenotype of chondrocytes.\r"

  ".W": "We have investigated, in young and aged rats, tuberoinfundibular dopaminergic (TIDA) and nigrostriatal neurons of the brain, and the role of the testes and anterior pituitary (AP) on 1) the in situ activity of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), 2) translation of TH mRNA, as reflected by the mass of TH, and 3) transcription of the TH gene, as revealed by the mass of TH mRNA. The median eminence (ME) and corpus striatum (CS) were used as the sources of proximal neurites of the TIDA neurons and nigrostriatal neurons, respectively. The arcuate-periventricular nuclei of the ventral hypothalamus were used as the source of perikarya of the TIDA neurons, and substantia nigra (SN) nuclei of the midbrain were used as the source of perikarya of nigrostriatal neurons. The in situ activity of TH was calculated using the rate of accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine after pharmacological inhibition of dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase activity. TH mass and TH mRNA were measured using an immunoblot assay and an S1 nuclease protection assay, respectively. Compared to intact animals, orchidectomized young and aged male rats had significantly (P less than 0.001) increased in situ activity of TH in the ME and CS, but not the SN. Orchidectomy also caused a significant (P less than 0.01) increase in the quantity of TH in the ME and a 2- to 3-fold increase in TH in the CS and SN. In contrast to castration, AP grafts, implanted in the lateral ventricles of the brain, caused a significant (P less than 0.001) increase only in TH activity in the ME. No effect of AP grafts was seen on TH activity of the CS or SN. AP grafts had no effect on the amount of TH in the ME, CS, or SN. In the TIDA neurons of young males and in the nigrostriatal neurons of young and aged castrates, the amount of TH mRNA was not different from that in intact males. AP grafts had no effect on TH mRNA in these dopaminergic neurons. These studies show that TIDA neurons and nigrostriatal neurons share some common aspects in their regulation and are dissimilar in others. AP grafts stimulate TH activity in young as well as aged TIDA neurons, but not in nigrostriatal neurons. Castration leads to an increase in TH mass in both TIDA and nigrostriatal neurons. The increase in TH mass is not associated with an increase in the amount of TH mRNA. It is suggested that castration results in increased translation of TH mRNA, but not transcription of the TH gene.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of GH, PRL, and placental lactogen (PL) on the proliferation of pancreatic beta-cells in vitro were studied as well as the possible effect of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in mediating this effect. Proliferating beta-cells were identified by staining with a monoclonal antibody to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) after cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 10 microM BrdU. By double staining with insulin antibodies it was found that 6.3% of the beta-cells had incorporated BrdU when cultured for 7 days in the presence of 1 microgram/ml human GH (hGH) compared to 0.6% when cultured in the absence of hGH. Similar results were obtained using rat GH. The half-maximal effect of hGH on beta-cell proliferation was observed at 10 ng/ml, and the maximal effect at 100 ng/ml. Islet cells cultured in the presence of PRL or PL caused a dose-dependent increase in beta-cell proliferation similar to that caused by hGH. GH, PRL, and PL had no effect on the proliferation of glucagon- or somatostatin-producing cells. The addition of 100 ng/ml IGF-I to either control or GH-stimulated islet cells did not affect the labeling index. When GH-stimulated proliferation of beta-cells was measured in the presence of neutralizing concentrations of a rabbit IGF-I antiserum, the percentage of beta-cells incorporating BrdU was unaffected. Using Northern blot analysis, no IGF-I transcripts could be detected in RNA from GH-stimulated islets, whereas IGF-I transcripts were readily detected in RNA isolated from rat liver tissue. These data suggest that the stimulatory effect of GH, PRL, and PL on beta-cell proliferation is not mediated by IGF-I, but, rather, is a direct mitogenic effect on the beta-cell.\r"

A total of 112 cells were studied in 20 experiments. The average resting [Ca2+]i was 113 +/- 6.4 nM. In 59 cells (53%), there was a 4.6 +/- 0.2-fold increase in [Ca2+]i within 29.3 +/- 1.0 sec of PGF2 alpha administration, and the cells recovered by 78.0 +/- 4.5 sec. The magnitude of the increase in [Ca2+]i in response to PGF2 alpha was not changed by an increase in the concentration of PGF2 alpha. Perifusion with low calcium buffer reduced, then eliminated, the [Ca2+]i response to PGF2 alpha. Perifusion of cells with PGF2 alpha resulted in a single transient [Ca2+]i response, similar to that after short term exposure to PGF2 alpha. Many (67%) of the cells that responded to PGF2 alpha also responded to GnRH. No additive increase in [Ca2+]i was seen when PGF2 alpha and GnRH were administered together. The source of the calcium appears to be intracellular stores that are shared by GnRH and PGF2 alpha.\r"

After reduction of an internal disulfide bond the fragments are released. 16K PRL was shown to be a potent mitogen on mammary epithelial cells via PRL receptors. Since estradiol-induced prolactinomas develop a new blood supply we tested the action of intact PRL and 16K PRL on growth of new vessels (angiogenesis). The angiogenic action of intact PRL and 16K PRL was tested in cultured bovine brain and adrenal cortex endothelial cells. Basal (b) or b-fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulated growth was estimated by counting cells or measuring the level of incorporation of 3H-thymidine into DNA. Paradoxically, 16K PRL inhibited the basal and FGF-stimulated growth of cultured endothelial cells in a dose-dependent fashion. Intact PRL or the cleaved but not reduced PRL were inactive even at a 100-fold higher concentration. When reformation of disulfide bonds was inhibited by carbamidomethylation of 16K PRL the preparations were more potent. 16K PRL had no effect on the mitogenic action of bFGF on baby hamster kidney cells which are known to have FGF receptors. These data demonstrate that in vitro 16K PRL is a potent and specific angiolytic factor, i.e. it inhibits angiogenesis. Furthermore, the action of 16K PRL does not appear to be via the known PRL or FGF receptors. Since angiogenesis is an essential component of tumor growth 16K PRL has potential as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer.\r"

  ".W": "In previous studies we found that plasma angiotensinogen levels were reduced by lesions of the hypothalamic paraventricular nuclei. To determine if the decrease was caused by decreased secretion of hormones that normally stimulate angiotensinogen secretion by the liver, we correlated the changes in plasma angiotensinogen produced by paraventricular lesions with changes in plasma LH, ACTH, and thyroid hormones; compared the changes in plasma angiotensinogen and other hormones to those produced by hypophysectomy; and determined the effects of treatment with ACTH and T4 in animals with paraventricular lesions. In male Sprague-Dawley rats, bilateral lesions destroying more than 50% of the paraventricular nuclei decreased plasma angiotensinogen to 787 +/- 52 ng angiotensin-I/ml in 7 days compared to 1576 +/- 142 ng angiotensin-I/ml in sham-operated controls. Plasma T3 and T4 were also reduced, whereas there were no statistically significant changes in plasma ACTH or LH. Hypophysectomy produced a comparable decline in plasma angiotensinogen and thyroid hormone levels. Daily administration of a single dose of ACTH had no effect on plasma angiotensinogen in rats with paraventricular lesions, but T4 treatment restored plasma angiotensinogen to normal levels. The data indicate that the decline in circulating angiotensinogen produced by lesions of the paraventricular nuclei is caused by the decrease in the secretion of thyroid hormones produced by these lesions. They also demonstrate that in addition to regulating circulating renin via the sympathetic nervous system, the brain has an effect on circulating angiotensinogen via neuroendocrine control of thyroid function.\r"

We purified these proteins, raised monospecific antibodies, and characterized them by Western blotting. Anti-n and anti-t-protein antibodies did not recognize t- and n-proteins, respectively. The n-protein was present in nuclear and cytosolic fractions, was present at low levels in the microsomal fraction, and was absent in the mitochondrial fraction of rat liver. The t-protein was more abundant in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions than in the nuclear fraction. The t-protein had the same molecular mass and shared immunological properties with peroxisomal enoyl-coenzyme-A (CoA) hydratase-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase bifunctional enzyme. The total cellular amount of n-protein increased 12 h after the administration of 1 microgram T3/100 g BW to thyroidectomized rats. Induction was obvious at 0.1 microgram T3/100 g BW after 24 h. Maximal induction was observed at 0.3 microgram T3/100 g BW. The n-protein was induced when thyroidectomized rat liver was perfused with 10(-7) M T3 for 6 h, excluding the possibility that the effect of T3 was mediated by an extrahepatic factor. The n-protein was detected in liver and brain, but not in kidney, heart, testis, or spleen. However, the amount of n-protein in brain was not thyroid hormone dependent. Hepatic n-protein does not correspond to any other T3-responsive protein in terms of its molecular mass and intracellular localization and may be a novel T3-responsive protein.\r"

  ".W": "We showed previously that human thyroglobulin (hTG) contains anionic complex carbohydrate units with up to four sulfate groups, some containing both sulfate and sialic acid. Recent reports indicate that the carbohydrate units of hTG may also contain phosphate, but these reports are not all in accord. The purpose of this study was to confirm the presence of phosphate on the carbohydrate units of hTG and to determine whether phosphate coexists with other acidic moieties, such as sulfate and sialic acid, on the same carbohydrate units. Alkaline phosphatase and acid hydrolysis were used to detect phosphate on the sulfated carbohydrate units of hTG derived from normal and neoplastic tissues. Thyroid fragments from two patients were incubated for 16 h in [35S]sulfate-containing medium, and hTG was purified. Complex carbohydrates were released from hTG with endoglycosidase-F and analyzed at pH 2.2 on a HPLC ion exchange column. Sulfate-containing peaks were monitored by radioactivity, and sialic acid-containing ones were identified by their reduced charge after neuraminidase or acid treatment. None of the sulfate-labeled carbohydrate peaks shifted after alkaline phosphatase treatment alone, indicating that none of them contained phosphomonoesters. Several of the sulfate-labeled peaks shifted after acid hydrolysis, some to positions of decreased charge, due to removal of sialic acid, and some to positions of increased charge, suggesting the presence of phosphodiesters. The latter was confirmed by the observation that some of the newly formed peaks were susceptible to alkaline phosphatase digestion. Thus, acid hydrolysis converted phosphodiesters into alkaline phosphatase-susceptible phosphomonoesters, most likely mannose-6-phosphate. We conclude that some anionic complex carbohydrate units of hTG contain exclusively sulfate, while others contain combinations of sulfate, sialic acid, and phosphodiesters. Phosphodiesters are present in the sulfated carbohydrate units of hTG from normal as well as neoplastic thyroid tissue.\r"

In Western blots of testicular homogenates of adult rats and mice and immature rats, immunoreactive single bands at approximately 30 kDa were detected. Immunocytochemistry revealed specific staining restricted to the tubular compartment. In 5-day-old rat testes, prespermatogonia were immunoreactive. The cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes was heavily stained in the adult testes of both species. Staining of these cells became evident around stage IV/V, was prominent in stage VII through IX and declined about stage XII/XIII (rat) or X-XI (mouse). Staining was seen in type A spermatogonia and in elongating spermatids in their cytoplasmatic lobes and along their flagellae. Sertoli cells were unstained. We propose that the pluripotential growth factor bFGF could be involved in the regulation of germ cell proliferation and differentiation in the adult and immature testis.\r"

  ".W": "Neuropeptide-Y (NPY) and glucocorticoid receptors are coexpressed in many neurons in the brain. We addressed the question: Do glucocorticoids regulate the accumulation and/or secretion of immunoreactive (IR) NPY by fetal rat brain cells in culture, and if so, is the effect developmental stage dependent? Aggregates, formed from dissociated cells obtained from the hypothalamus-olfactory tubercle of 17-day-old fetuses, were cultured in serum-free medium for 23 days. On day 23, the aggregate NPY content was 6 ng/flask, and secretion (last 2 days) was approximately 12 ng/24 h. Exposure to dexamethasone (Dex; 20 nM) between days 0-23 led to a 1.9-fold increase in the aggregate content of NPY, whereas NPY secretion was not altered. When Dex exposure was limited to days 12-23, 16-23, 19-23, or 21-23, only a 12- to 23-day exposure induced NPY accumulation, and it was as effective as a 0- to 23-day exposure. The Dex-induced increase in NPY content was evident after a lag period of 4 days or more. When Dex exposure occurred on days 0-12, the aggregate NPY content on day 12 or 23 was not altered. None of these treatments altered the aggregate/medium content of immunoreactive somatostatin (SRIF) or the response to a 48-h exposure to forskolin (10 microM). Dex induction of NPY accumulation was a saturable function of the Dex concentration (maximal at 20 nM), and it was completely inhibited by RU486, a glucocorticoid/progesterone receptor antagonist; neither progesterone, 17 beta-estradiol, nor testosterone altered aggregate/medium NPY contents. Protein/DNA contents of the aggregates were either unaffected or slightly reduced by Dex. Thus, 1) Dex stimulates the accumulation of immunoreactive NPY, but not SRIF, by cultured fetal brain cells; 2) this effect requires a continuous 8-12 days of exposure to Dex during a late developmental stage in culture; 3) Dex does not potentiate or attenuate forskolin action on the NPY neuron; and 4) Dex action appears to be mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. These results are consistent with glucocorticoid induction of production and/or decreased intracellular degradation of NPY, and with glucocorticoids regulating the NPY neuron in the perinatal brain in a developmental age-dependent manner.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) binds to specific receptors and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that are present on cell surfaces. The analysis of [125I]IGF-I binding to human fibroblasts is complicated by IGFBPs on the cell surface and their release into the medium during the binding assay. This release alters the distribution of [125I]IGF-I between type I IGF receptors and both soluble as well as cell surface-associated IGFBPs. In the present study we have determined the effects of three different forms of IGFBPs on [125I]IGF-I binding to cell surface binding sites of human fetal fibroblasts (GM10 cells) and porcine smooth muscle cells. Human 29,000 mol wt (Mr; IGFBP-1), bovine 34,000 Mr (IGFBP-2), and bovine 46,000 Mr (IGFBP-3) forms of IGFBP were compared. Each of the three IGFBPs inhibited [125I]IGF-I binding to the cell surface of both cell types. This effect was due to increased binding of [125I]IGF-I by the IGFBPs in the assay buffer. At equimolar concentrations, IGFBP-3 was more effective than either IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-2 in blocking cell surface binding. The addition of increasing concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I in the presence of each IGFBP showed that either IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-3, but not IGFBP-2, resulted in a paradoxical increase in [125I]IGF-I binding to the cell surface. The paradoxical increase occurred in the presence of excess insulin, indicating that unsaturated type I IGF receptors are not required to demonstrate this phenomenon. In a physiological salt solution, the order of affinity of the IGFBPs for IGF-I was IGFBP-3 greater than IGFBP-1 greater than IGFBP-2. These differences in affinity appear to account for the differences in IGF-I competition for binding that are seen when each of the three proteins is added. Thus, IGFBPs have the potential to alter the partitioning of IGF-I between cell surface-associated IGFBPs, membrane receptors, and the IGFBPs in extracellular fluids. The various forms of IGFBP affect IGF cell surface binding differently, and therefore, each may have distinct effects on IGF target cell actions.\r"

Together with the carcinoembryonic antigen, they form new members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. To study the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of the PSG gene, we established a human amnion cell line, HAA58OD-8C, immortalized with an origin-defective simian virus-40 (SV40) temperature-sensitive A58 mutant virus. HAA58OD-8C cells were temperature sensitive for maintenance of transformation and expressed genes encoding PSG and the alpha- and beta-subunits of hCG. At the permissive temperature (33 C; transformed phenotype), they expressed low levels of PSG, hCG alpha, and hCG beta mRNAs and synthesized low levels of a 48K PSG polypeptide. At the nonpermissive temperature (39.5 C), HAA58OD-8C cells exhibited a differentiated phenotype, expressed increased levels of PSG, hCG alpha, and hCG beta mRNAs, and produced high levels of PSG polypeptides of 72K and 48K. Sodium butyrate induced PSG mRNA expression, and in the presence of butyrate, HAA58OD-8C cells produced high amounts of PSG polypeptides of 72K, 62K, and 48K. Ribonuclease protection analysis indicated that similar PSG transcripts were expressed by HAA58OD-8C cells and human term placenta. However, these amnion cells expressed selectively a certain population of PSG transcripts. Our results show that this amnion cell line provides a suitable model for studies of PSG gene expression and regulation.\r"

The ability of the mu-agonist morphine and the kappa-agonist U-50,488 to stimulate the HPA axis was determined by evaluating ACTH and corticosterone (CS) secretion in developing rat pups. Morphine elicited marked rises in both ACTH and CS secretion in 10-day-old rats, and these increases were maximal from 30-60 min after drug administration. Both morphine and U50,488H caused a dose-related rise in CS secretion that was blocked by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone. The mu-opiate antagonist beta-funaltrexamine blocked the morphine-induced rise in CS secretion, and the kappa-antagonist norbinaltorphimine blocked the action of U50,488H. While a maximal dose of U50,488H (1 mg/kg) elicited a significant rise in CS secretion as early as postnatal day 2, significant effects of a maximal dose of morphine (5 mg/kg) were not observed until day 5. The effects of both drugs were significantly blunted during the stress-hyporesponsive period from days 5-15. The results of this study demonstrate that significant opiate receptor control of HPA function can be demonstrated early in postnatal development, even before the onset of the stress-hyporesponsive period. In addition, these data suggest that kappa-receptor control is functional before mu-receptor control of HPA function.\r"

  ".W": "Membranes prepared from the medullary region of the porcine kidney displayed high affinity, high density (Kd, 0.12 nM; binding capacity, 127 fmol/mg protein) receptors for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Human CGRP (hCGRP), rat CGRP (rCGRP), and the hCGRP analog [hCGRP-(8-37)] competed for the binding of [125I]hCGRP, whereas salmon calcitonin (sCT) and CGRP-(22-37) were very weak in displacing [125I]hCGRP binding. In accordance with these binding data, CGRP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in these membrane preparations in a concentration-dependent manner, with an EC50 similar to that of the Kd for binding. In the same preparations, sCT was ineffective in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity, suggesting that porcine kidney medullary membranes possess receptors specific for CGRP. Further hCGRP-(8-37), a CGRP antagonist, inhibited CGRP-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in a competitive manner. Covalent cross-linking of [125I]hCGRP to these membranes resulted in the specific labeling of one major band at approximately 30,000 mol wt and two minor bands at about 58,000 and 78,000 mol wt. The presence of CGRP receptors and their coupling to adenylate cyclase suggest a role for CGRP in kidney function, such as local regulation of the microcirculation, electrolyte transport, or water homeostasis in the porcine kidney.\r"

In this further study of the effects of PRL on lymphocytes in vitro we found that PRL induced IL-2 receptor expression, IL-2 production, and proliferation of splenocytes and thymocytes from OVX rats. Cells from male rats were not affected. The proliferative response, as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, depended on the concentration of PRL and the presence of adherent cells in the culture. After a 48-h incubation with PRL (1 microgram/ml), splenocytes from OVX rats incorporated essentially the same amount of [3H]thymidine as cells incubated with the polyclonal T-cell mitogen Concanavalin-A (ConA). As determined by autoradiography, approximately 40% of the splenocytes responded to PRL or to ConA. After incubation of splenocytes and thymocytes with PRL, bioactive IL-2 was detected in culture medium only from cells of OVX female rats, while incubation with ConA caused IL-2 production by lymphocytes from both male and OVX rats. However, ConA induced IL-2 activity sooner than PRL. Immunofluorescent-flow cytometric analysis revealed time-dependent increases in percentages of IL-2 receptor-positive splenocytes as well as increases in percentages of total T-cells and cells of the CD8 and, to a lesser extent, the CD4 subclass after PRL stimulation.\r"

Only high risk patients with active bleeding or endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage and accessible ulcers were considered. The two groups were well matched for age, shock, haemoglobin concentration, endoscopic findings, and consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The group treated endoscopically had a significantly reduced rebleeding rate (12.5% v 47%, p less than 0.001). Rebleeding was successfully treated in some patients by injection sclerotherapy, other patients underwent urgent surgery. While there was a tendency towards a lower operation rate and lower transfusion requirements in the treated group, this failed to achieve statistical significance. The use of injection sclerotherapy in the conservatively treated group after rebleeding undoubtedly reduced the number of surgical operations. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy is effective in the prevention of rebleeding in these patients.\r"

There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7.4, p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval odds ratio 3.7 to 14.7). There also was a significant difference in the use of aspirin (odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.025; 95% CI odds ratio 1.3 to 4.0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5.5, p less than 0.001; 95% CI odds ratio 3.2 to 9.6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0.30 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and for aspirin use 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20).\r"

  ".W": "An endoscopic technique for the measurement of gastric mucosal bleeding time has been developed to study gastric haemostasis in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The relation of gastric mucosal bleeding time to skin bleeding time and nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drug usage was examined in 61 control patients and in 47 patients presenting with bleeding peptic ulcers or erosions. Gastric mucosal bleeding time was shorter in patients with haemorrhage (median 2 minutes, range 0-5 minutes) than in the control group (median 4 minutes, range 2-8 minutes) (p less than 0.001). Skin bleeding times were similar in the two groups (medians 4 minutes in patients with haemorrhage and 4.5 minutes in controls). In 21 patients with haemorrhage who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the median gastric mucosal bleeding time (2.5 minutes, range 1.0-5.0 minutes) was similar to that in 26 patients with haemorrhage not associated with these drugs (2.0 minutes, range 0.0-5.0 minutes). These results show that gastric mucosal haemostasis is accelerated in response to haemorrhage in the upper gastrointestinal tract, even in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This enhanced gastric haemostasis probably reflects a local protective response to minimise blood loss from the bleeding lesion.\r"

A total of 930 cases of cancer were observed during 76,634 person-years. Relative risks of cancer were computed by comparison with the recorded cancer incidence in the Danish population. During the first five years after surgery the relative risk of gastric cancer was slightly increased (RR = 1.43), but 5-15 years after the operation the risk was lower than expected (RR = 0.55). Thereafter, the relative risk of gastric cancer increased steadily and increased more than twofold after 25 years. Lung cancer occurred more frequently in the cohort members than expected (RR = 1.66), but the relative risk was independent of time since surgery. Malignancies other than gastric cancer and cancers related to tobacco smoking were close to the expected numbers. The results do not support the findings of a recent British study of similar size in which increased risks were reported for cancer at other sites.\r"

Aspiration cytology gave the highest diagnostic accuracy (94%), which was significantly better than that of brush cytology (84.9%) and biopsy (87.2%) (p less than 0.005). The difference was mainly related to tumour pattern. When compared to brush cytology and biopsy aspiration cytology was significantly better in submucosal tumours (92.9% v 7.1% and 14.3%, p less than 0.001); in infiltrative malignancies (95.8% v 90.1% and 78.9%, p less than 0.01), and in ulceronecrotic malignancies (90.9% v 36.4% and 45.4%, p less than 0.05). In polypoid malignancies there was a significant trend (p less than 0.05) in favour of forceps biopsy, with a diagnostic yield of 100% compared with 95% for aspiration cytology and 93.3% for brush cytology. The accuracy of the different techniques was not significantly related to the site of the tumour. The cumulative accuracy of aspiration cytology and biopsy was significantly better than that of biopsy and brush cytology (98.5% v 90.9%, p less than 0.005). Aspiration cytology was diagnostic in 21 of 24 lesions that were negative with both brush cytology and biopsy. There were no false positive cytology or histology results. We conclude that aspiration cytology is a simple, safe, and reliable technique with a high diagnostic yield and is of particular value in submucosal, infiltrative, and ulceronecrotic tumours.\r"

Little is known of the permeability properties of the intestinal mucosa in uraemic patients. The intestinal permeability to differently sized polyethylene glycols (PEGs; range 326-1254 daltons) was studied in nine patients with chronic renal failure (24 hour endogeneous creatinine clearance 5-24 ml/minute). The maximum 24 hour urinary recovery of PEGs was decreased in the uraemic patients but relatively more of the larger than the smaller PEGs were found in these patients. The results suggest a reduced urinary recovery of PEGs caused by renal dysfunction but also a relatively increased intestinal permeability to larger PEGs in the uraemic patients.\r"

Intense staining for hyaluronan was seen in the loose connective tissue of the villi and of lamina propria while the epithelial layer was unstained. The muscularis mucosae showed only faint staining. The accumulation of hyaluronan in the subepithelial layer of the jejunal mucosa indicates that the previously reported high jejunal secretion of hyaluronan is due to passive diffusion from the subepithelial interstitium. The physicochemical characteristics conferred by hyaluronan may be important for the villi function.\r"

Small bowel tumours causing gastrointestinal bleeding may remain undetected despite extensive diagnostic evaluation. We conclude that small bowel tumours are the most common cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients less than 50 years of age. Small bowel enteroscopy is diagnostic of small bowel tumours even when all previous diagnostic studies, including enteroclysis and angiography, are negative.\r"

  ".U": "91309917\r", 
  ".W": "Dietary sulphate may affect colonic pathophysiology because sulphate availability determines in part the activity of sulphate reducing bacteria in the bowel. The main product of sulphate reducing bacterial oxidative metabolism, hydrogen sulphide, is potentially toxic. Although it is generally believed that the sulphate ion is poorly absorbed, there are no available data on how much sulphate reaches the colon nor on the relative contributions from diet and endogenous sources. To resolve these questions, balance studies were performed on six healthy ileostomists and three normal subjects chosen because they did not have detectable sulphate reducing bacteria in their faeces. The subjects were fed diets which varied in sulphate content from 1.6-16.6 mmol/day. Sulphate was measured in diets, faeces (ileal effluent in ileostomists), and urine by anion exchange chromatography with conductivity detection. Overall there was net absorption of dietary sulphate, with the absorptive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract plateauing at 5 mmol/day in the ileostomists and exceeding 16 mmol/day in the normal subjects. Endogenous secretion of sulphate in the upper gastrointestinal tract was from 0.96-2.6 mmol/day. The dietary contribution to the colonic sulphate pool ranged up to 9 mmol/day, there being linear identity between diet and upper gastrointestinal losses for intakes above 7 mmol/day. Faecal losses of sulphate were trivial (less than 0.5 mmol/day) in the normal subjects at all doses. It is concluded that diet and intestinal absorption are the principal factors affecting the amounts of sulphate reaching the colon. Endogenous secretion of sulphate by colonic mucosa may also be important in determining amounts of sulphate in the colon.\r"

All the patients were followed up for at least five years. Venous invasion was present in 30 of the polyps (37%). The histological features of lymphatic invasion were considered too subjective to be of value. Most of the tumours were well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas, one was poorly differentiated, and one was a signet ring cell carcinoma. Seventy one patients were treated by polypectomy alone, and 58 of these were alive and well five years later, with no evidence of recurrence. Nine died of unrelated causes within five years, but four died of carcinomatosis: one with recurrent tumour, one with a possible metachronous caecal cancer, and in two patients there was late development of malignancy of uncertain nature. The remaining nine patients underwent surgical resection after initial endoscopic polypectomy because of incompleteness of excision, poor differentiation of the tumour, or a decision by the surgeon. Tumour was not present in the resection specimens apart from a single lymph node deposit in the patient with signet ring cell carcinoma. These nine patients were alive and well without evidence of recurrence five years later. The results reemphasise the necessity of good cooperation between endoscopist and pathologist, meticulous laboratory technique, strict histopathological criteria including examination of resection margins and degree of differentiation of the tumour, and regular endoscopic follow up.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In Crohn's disease there were many activated T cells (CD3+, CD25+). Although natural killer cells in active Crohn's disease were lower than in normal control subjects, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, as defined by CD3+, CD16+, did not differ in patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared with normal control subjects. For B cell subsets, there were differences in Leu-1+ B cells, Leu-8+ B cells, Fc epsilon R+B cells (Leu-16+, Leu-20+), and activated B cells (Leu-12+, Leu-21+) between patients with inflammatory bowel disease and normal control subjects.

  ".W": "The criteria now used in an attempt to distinguish irritable bowel syndrome from organic gastrointestinal disease rely almost entirely on symptoms of colonic origin. 'Non-colonic' symptoms, however, arising either from elsewhere in the gut or of a more general nature, are common in irritable bowel syndrome and may have even better diagnostic potential. The prevalence of these non-colonic features was assessed in 107 patients with the irritable bowel syndrome and 295 subjects with other gut disorders. Gastrointestinal type non-colonic symptoms are useful in differentiating irritable bowel syndrome from inflammatory bowel disease but, with the exception of early satiety, are not helpful when there is gastro-oesophageal or biliary disease. More general 'non-colonic' features, such as lethargy and backache, are much commoner in irritable bowel syndrome than in all the organic gastrointestinal diseases studied and have good discriminant function. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified certain features that had a particularly significant independent risk for irritable bowel syndrome. Those were lethargy (relative risk 6.7), incomplete evacuation (RR 5.2), age under 40 (RR 2.1), backache (RR 2.0), early satiety (RR 1.8), and frequency of micturition (RR 1.8). These relative risks can be multiplied together to give an overall risk when more than one of these features is present in a patient. Until a diagnostic test is available more confident diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome can be achieved by identifying symptoms that have good discriminant function. The results of this study indicate that the non-colonic features of irritable bowel syndrome may be especially valuable in this respect.\r"

The pI 5.4 fraction inhibited cholera toxin as well as toxin A induced fluid secretion, while pI 5.0 inhibited toxin A induced secretion only.

Sodium dodecyl-sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the pI 5.0 protein showed two major fractions to be present, one of molecular weight 60 kDa, the other of 30 kDa, the latter probably being a degradation product of the former.\r"

Three groups of patients were studied: group A comprised 44 patients, mean (SD) age 4.0 (3.1) years, with coeliac disease and total or subtotal atrophy of the intestinal mucosa; group B comprised 67 patients, mean age 4.4 (3.0) years, with coeliac disease but with normal morphology of the intestinal villi (after 12.9 months of a gluten free diet); group C comprised 49 control subjects, mean age 3.2 (3.0) years, with normal jejunal histology. In all subjects exocrine pancreatic function was determined by the secretin-caerulein test; bicarbonate concentration and lipase, phospholipase, and chymotrypsin activity were measured after an intravenous injection of secretin 1 clinical unit (CU) + caerulein 75 ng/kg body weight. Faecal chymotrypsin concentration was also assayed. No significant difference was found between values of the duodenal output of pancreatic enzymes and bicarbonate obtained in the three groups; however, 10 of 44 untreated coeliac patients showed tryptic or lipolytic activity, or both, below the normal limit for our laboratory. The mean value of the faecal chymotrypsin concentration was significantly lower in untreated than in treated coeliac patients (p less than 0.0001) or in control subjects (p less than 0.0001). It is concluded that untreated coeliac patients may have pancreatic deficiency independent of a decrease in enterohormone release. No primary or secondary pancreatic insufficiency was found in coeliac patients where the intestinal mucosa had returned to normal.\r"

  ".U": "91310248\r", 
  ".W": "Modern antihypertensive therapy is enriched by an explosion in drug development that makes available increasingly specific agents whose effects have advanced our understanding of pressor mechanisms. This and other research into hypertensive mechanisms has defined the clinical, pharmacological, and endocrinologic heterogeneity of human hypertension. The sum of these developments is a greatly enhanced ability to identify curable and definable causes of hypertension and to pathophysiologically stratify the remaining cases of essential hypertension. Modern treatment can be much more specific than before. When long-term drug therapy is indicated, the regimen is more likely to achieve a primary goal for each patient, that is, the fewest possible drugs in the smallest amount and in lowest frequency. Two clinically quantifiable mechanisms for long-term arteriolar vasoconstriction can be identified within the spectrum of human hypertension. The first, renin-mediated vasoconstriction, is directly related to the plasma renin level. The second, sodium-volume-related vasoconstriction, is marked by a reciprocally subnormal renin level and involves abnormal sodium retention and calcium transport. A baseline renin-sodium profile can identify the pressure of one of these two forms of vasoconstriction and therefore is the key for the diagnosis of the two curable disorders that fully express one of the two pressor mechanisms--renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Renovascular hypertension, more common than once thought, is often cured by angioplasty. It is important to diagnose these curable forms before beginning long-term drug therapy. The renin-sodium profile, used in conjunction with serum potassium and creatinine measurements, is valuable not only in screening patients for curable forms, but also for stratifying the remainder according to the pathophysiological vasoconstrictor mechanism that underlies the hypertension. Converting enzyme inhibitors or beta-blockers are, by themselves, often effective in correcting the hypertension of high- or medium-renin patients, whereas calcium antagonists, diuretic agents, or alpha-blockers alone are most effective against the low-renin form of vasoconstriction. In the large midzone of renin values, if monotherapy fails, a rational basis for combined antirenin-antisodium volume therapies can be developed.\r"

The numbers of prescriptions and the diagnostic and drug treatment information were obtained from the National Prescription Audit (Ambler, Pa, IMS America, 1985) the National Disease and Therapeutic Index (Ambler, Pa, IMS America, 1985), ongoing surveys of pharmacies, and office-based physicians. We adjusted drug-use data for the fact that several antihypertensive drugs also have other uses. During the study period, the annual numbers of prescriptions for treatment of hypertension progressively increased from 128.1 to 208.6 million, an average change of 5% per year. In 1973, the three leading classes of antihypertensive drugs were thiazide diuretic agents, peripheral neuronal inhibitors, and central alpha-adrenergic receptor stimulators. By 1985, the thiazide drugs were still the leader, followed by beta-adrenergic receptor blockers and potassium-sparing diuretic drugs. The use trends presented are consistent with surveys indicating increased drug therapy of hypertension from 1960 to the present.\r"

In 1984, the third Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) for the first time suggested an alternative initial treatment with a beta-blocker in selected hypertensive patients, and the fourth JNC report has recommended the alternatives of calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors for step-one therapy as well. However, only the diuretic drugs and beta-blockers have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in prospective, long-term, controlled trials. Moreover, 30 years' experience with diuretic agents and 20 years' experience with beta-blockers have defined the advantages, disadvantages, and potential side effects of these drugs more precisely than is possible for newer agents. The diuretic drugs and beta-blockers remain excellent choices in the management of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibiting agents have emerged with the diuretic agents, beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents, and calcium antagonists as therapeutic options for major consideration during the initial treatment of hypertensive patients. These compounds antagonize a potent pressor mechanism underlying hypertensive disease. The ACE inhibitors curtail the generation of the potent octapeptide angiotensin II; in addition, degradation of the potent vasodilator bradykinin is inhibited. Hemodynamically, ACE inhibitors reduce arterial pressure through a decreased total peripheral resistance that is unassociated with reflex stimulation of the heart or expansion of intravascular volume. The arteriolar dilation accounting for the decreased vascular resistance seems to occur in each target organ of the disease. Unlike the direct-acting smooth muscle vasodilators or adrenergic inhibitors, ACE inhibitors dilate the efferent as well as the afferent glomerular arterioles and thereby reduce glomerular hydrostatic pressure and renal filtration fraction, even though renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are preserved. The ACE-inhibiting compounds not only reduce left ventricular afterload in hypertension but also diminish cardiac mass and wall thicknesses. The mechanism(s) for some of these actions have not yet been defined precisely, but they undoubtedly involve the autocrine/paracrine actions of the renopressor system and their effects in the cellular biologic events of vascular smooth muscle and the cardiac myocyte. It seems plausible and exciting that the \"more local\" renin-angiotensin systems will be exploited by those ACE inhibitors yet to be synthesized, which will result in new applications for this class of pharmacological agents.\r"

One relatively new class of agents is the selective alpha 1-inhibitors, which have distinct advantages over earlier nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents. Three alpha 1-inhibitors are reviewed in this article: prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. These alpha 1-inhibitors are similar in chemical structure and pharmacological action. alpha 1-Inhibitors lower blood pressure by reducing vascular tone in resistance and capacitance vessels. alpha 1-Inhibitors are similar in effectiveness in blood pressure lowering to other commonly used antihypertensive agents like the thiazide diuretic drugs and beta-blockers, which are efficacious as monotherapy in lowering pressure, as initial agents, or in combination with other antihypertensive agents in multidrug therapeutic regimens. alpha 1-Inhibitors are associated with a reasonably low incidence of serious adverse effects and are essentially free of any adverse metabolic effects. alpha 1-Inhibitors have been shown to beneficially effect blood lipids in several studies. The favorable lipid effect makes alpha 1-inhibitors especially appropriate to use in diabetic hypertensive and other patients with elevated serum lipid levels. The beneficial lipid effects may enhance the ability of alpha 1-inhibitors to prevent coronary heart disease, an outcome that has been difficult to demonstrate in thiazide-based trials.\r"

  ".W": "Calcium channel blockers are recently developed antihypertensive drugs. In terms of mechanisms of action, their specificity is not so well established as that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors but is better understood than that for diuretics or adrenergic-inhibiting drugs. Calcium channel blockers were originally developed for treatment of angina but were found to lower arterial pressure as well. Three of them are now in wide use in the United States; their therapeutic spectrum in regard to type of hypertension is broad. Sublingual nifedipine has replaced intravenously administered vasodilators as immediate treatment of severe hypertension, and all three drugs, given orally, have been shown to be effective in mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. The three drugs available in this country are verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. Pharmacological studies have shown that verapamil has the most negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of the three, with nifedipine producing the most vasodilation and having the potential for causing reflex tachycardia. Actually in practice, these various pharmacological differences have proved to have less significance than previously thought, and the drugs seem to have about equal antihypertensive effectiveness. Comparisons of calcium entry blockers with other drugs have shown them to be equally effective in whites as propranolol but more effective in blacks. Responsiveness appears to be related, as well, to pretreatment plasma renin activity and age. Thus, the antihypertensive effect is directly related to age and inversely related to plasma renin activity. The side effects mostly relate to vasodilation, reflex tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and edema; they are not frequent, and the drugs are well tolerated.\r"

When nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension fails, initial drug treatment with diuretic drugs, sympatholytic agents (including beta-adrenergic receptor blockers), or vasodilators will result in satisfactory blood pressure control. However, each of these therapies has effects that are independent of their antihypertensive activity and that should be considered before a selection is made for initial therapy. The adverse effects of diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs on plasma lipid profiles may diminish the beneficial effects of blood pressure reduction. On the other hand, the hypocholesterolemic effect of alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists, the potential cardioprotective effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, and the salutary effects of calcium channel blockers on left ventricular function are responses that would support the use of vasodilatory therapy. Vasodilating antihypertensive drugs may be more beneficial than \"standard\" therapy and should be considered for the initial treatment of newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.\r"

  ".W": "Renal failure is a well-recognized complication of accelerated and malignant hypertension that can be prevented by appropriate antihypertensive therapy. The risk of renal disease in patients with milder forms of hypertension is less certain. Death certificate, insurance industry, and community-based observational studies provide little information with respect to the risk of kidney damage in the hypertensive patient. Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive drug therapy provide equivocal results. The strongest evidence in support of the hypothesis that mild hypertension increases the risk of subsequent renal disease comes from analyses of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and the Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program. The risk of blood pressure-related ESRD appears to be especially high in blacks, independent of age, sex, and prevalence of hypertension. Although these results need to be confirmed, the data raise the possibility that the effects of high blood pressure on the kidney are different in blacks than in whites. Based on current trends, it is projected that the number of beneficiaries in the Medicare ESRD Program will continue to increase during the next 30-40 years and that the diagnosis of hypertensive ESRD will become increasingly common. Additional studies to characterize the relation between mild hypertension and subsequent risk of renal disease and to confirm the corresponding benefits of antihypertensive therapy are urgently needed.\r"

  ".U": "91310264\r", 
  ".W": "Among the 356,222 men screened for the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial who had no history of hospitalization for heart attack at entry, more than 2,000 coronary deaths occurred during 6 years of follow-up. With this large data set, detailed cross-tabulations clearly and simply showed the strong graded relation between blood pressure and coronary heart disease death. This risk gradient was evident in each of five age groups ranging from 35 to 57 years and for levels of diastolic blood pressure ranging from less than 75 mm Hg to greater than 115 mm Hg. Systolic blood pressure was more strongly associated with coronary heart disease death than was diastolic blood pressure, and isolated systolic blood pressure elevation was found to be an important risk factor in these middle-aged men. The risk of coronary death was increased among hypertensive men who had elevated serum cholesterol levels or who smoked cigarettes. Because less than 10% of hypertensive men had cholesterol levels in the lowest quintile (below 182 mg/dl) and were nonsmokers, a multi-intervention approach for the large majority of hypertensive persons is clearly indicated. Risks of death were also substantially increased among those hypertensive men who already had end-organ damage, emphasizing the importance of early treatment to prevent such damage. These findings have implications for the design of prevention trials and clinical practice, as it is clear that systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure should be considered in treating hypertensive patients. Additionally, treatment goals should be directed at preventing not only death but many other morbid events, clinical and subclinical, that are associated with elevated blood pressure and that are preventable with appropriate treatment.\r"

  ".W": "The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study, an investigation of a cohort originally examined during the period 1971-1975, provided an opportunity to assess the frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in the United States during the period 1982-1984. For most age-sex-race subgroups, the frequency of medication use during 1982-1984 was higher than that observed during 1976-1980 based on the NHANES II. In the interval 1982-1984, diuretic agents were the most frequent medications prescribed (47% of drugs prescribed), and beta-blockers were second (17%). At the time of the initial survey in 1971-1975, participants had their blood pressures measured and a history of diagnosis and treatment of hypertension ascertained. Follow-up for vital status was 93% complete by 1984 (average length of follow-up, 9 years). In white men and women aged 50 years and older, the relative risk of death increased steadily, from those with elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg) but no history of hypertension to those treated for hypertension but whose blood pressure was still elevated. Regardless of history or treatment, those with an elevated blood pressure had about a 25-30% excess risk of death. Evidence from these national studies shows a high frequency of antihypertensive drug therapy in 1982-1984 and suggests the importance of adequate blood pressure control for optimal survival.\r"

  ".W": "There is a strong and graded association between blood pressure and the incidence of major coronary heart disease manifestations, congestive heart failure, stroke, and total mortality. The risk of any of these manifestations is also modified by other risk factors. Tobacco smoking affects the risk for all of the previously mentioned end points. Generally, lipid disturbances are only important predictors of coronary heart disease and total mortality. Several facts indicate that elevated blood pressure is causally related to the end points. There are, however, positive relations between blood pressure levels and heart rate, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, and, according to some studies, glucose intolerance. Some more basic abnormality may be responsible for the blood pressure increase and the increases in these other factors. Hypothetically, this abnormality may be more fundamentally related to some of the end points than is hypertension itself. If that is the case, then the type of antihypertensive treatment may be of decisive importance. Different end points may be affected differently by antihypertensive drugs, a factor that may be essential in the choice of drug treatment. Proper management of other risk factors is also essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".U": "91310267\r", 
  ".W": "We reviewed the designs and major results of 17 large-scale, controlled, clinical trials that reported the effects of drug treatment for hypertension on morbidity or mortality. Seven trials conducted in study populations with more-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-120 mm Hg or higher), including the more-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, showed large reductions in stroke, other \"hypertensive\" events, and, in one trial, total mortality. Of 11 trials in populations with less-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures predominantly below 105 mm Hg), including the less-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, nine met the criteria for pooling of results. Among the aggregate 43,000 patients in the nine trials who were followed up for an average of 5.6 years, mean diastolic blood pressure reduction was 5.8 mm Hg, and a significant 11% reduction in total mortality was observed. This benefit was largely attributable to a 38% reduction in fatal strokes; nonfatal strokes were similarly reduced. Coronary heart disease mortality was 8% lower in drug treatment than in control groups, but this difference was not significant. A similar result was observed for combined coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. A possible explanation for the inconclusive result regarding coronary end points was an adverse trend, observed in several trials, in a subgroup with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities. Because all the trials except the propranolol arm of the Medical Research Council trial used drug regimens based on thiazide-like diuretic agents, and because there are now several new drug classes proposed as initial therapy, additional large-scale clinical trials may need to be considered.\r"

  ".U": "91310268\r", 
  ".W": "The effects of prolonged differences in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the risks of stroke and of coronary heart disease (CHD) were estimated from nine major prospective observational studies involving about 420,000 men and women who were followed up for intervals of 6-25 years. The results indicate that a prolonged difference of about 6 mm Hg in DBP was associated with approximately 37% fewer strokes and 23% fewer CHD deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarctions. The effects of equivalent reductions in DBP produced by antihypertensive drug treatment but maintained for only a few years have been estimated in several overviews of randomized trials involving a total of 30,000-40,000 patients. The results of the overviews indicate that treatment reduced the risk of stroke by about 40%, suggesting that most or all the long-term potential benefits for stroke due to lower DBP were achieved within about 3 years of beginning treatment. The risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death may have been reduced by about 10% among patients allocated to active treatment; the 95% confidence limits for the difference ranged from about zero to about 20%. Whatever the true effect of treatment on CHD, it would appear somewhat less than the difference in risk estimated from the observational studies for a prolonged difference in DBP of the same size. This apparent shortfall in benefit may reflect a long time-course for changes in DBP to have their full effects on CHD, possible adverse side effects of the principal trial treatments, or both.\r"

  ".U": "91310269\r", 
  ".W": "When deciding whether to treat a patient with hypertension, clinicians must balance the benefit of treatment against its adverse effects. In the absence of an interaction, the multiplicative model of risk implies that the absolute benefit of treatment is related to the underlying risk of an adverse outcome. Thus, each additional risk factor multiplies the absolute benefit of treating hypertension. Analyses of data from subgroups in clinical trials of hypertension treatment suggest that this model is usually valid. In contrast, the adverse effects of treatment are usually unrelated to other risk factors. Thus, the cutoff point for treatment differs in different individuals: setting a single treatment threshold and goal for the entire population is not appropriate. Patients who are at high absolute risk because of prior coronary artery disease or other risk factors have a greater potential absolute benefit, and such patients deserve a low threshold and goal, such as a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg. Conversely, persons at low risk, such as white women without other risk factors, do not require such aggressive management.\r"

  ".U": "91310270\r", 
  ".W": "Three recently concluded large randomized clinical trials have compared the preventive effects of diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of approximately 22,000 subjects with hypertension. In the Medical Research Council trial, bendrofluazide (10 mg daily) was compared with a dose of propranolol (as much as 240 mg daily), a nonselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two selective beta-blockers, atenolol (100 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily), were compared with bendrofluazide (5-10 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial. In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, 160 mg of slow-release oxprenolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared with a diuretic-based regimen not containing beta-blockers. In each trial, similar reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were achieved with diuretic and beta-blocker treatment that lasted for several years. All-cause mortality and fatal and nonfatal stroke and coronary event rates were also similar in the treatment groups. Thus, it appears that beta-blockers are as effective as diuretic agents in improving survival and in preventing major morbid events. Regarding cigarette smoking and stroke incidence, observations based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the Medical Research Council trial were not supported by subgroup findings in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension and the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension trials, and these observations should not form the basis for any treatment recommendations.\r"

  ".W": "Benzothiadiazine diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs are two of the main groups of drugs used to treat mild hypertension. Recently, questions have been raised about their relative efficacy in preventing morbidity and mortality from vascular disease in addition to their effect on lowering blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the unfavorable metabolic effects of diuretic drugs and the proven value of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Four randomized controlled trials comparing drugs in these two classes have been published: the Medical Research Council trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial, and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension study. These trials, especially that of the Medical Research Council, have raised some questions about the relative efficacy of these two classes of drugs in preventing stroke in smokers and nonsmokers. Overall, there is little evidence of a reduction in morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. The predicted advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade over diuretic therapy has not been realized although there are sufficient hints of a differential benefit to encourage the performance of further trials.\r"

The observation of all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in the group ultimately selected to participate in the trial is suggested as an index to the general applicability of trial results. Because end-point rates are fundamental for determining sample size, substantial reduction in these end-point rates by patient exclusion should be taken into account by the trial design. Some recent trials may have generated end-point-event rates so low that the power of the trial to detect reasonable treatment effects was substantially reduced. Future trials should attempt to take this important factor into account at the design stage.\r"

  ".W": "The steady decline in mortality from stroke in the United States accelerated markedly in the 1970s. It has been widely assumed that an increase in the rate of treatment of hypertension is the most likely explanation for this major public health achievement. An analysis of available information, however, suggests that improvements in the community control of hypertension in the United States in the period 1970-1980 have contributed in only a minor way. There were 45,357 fewer deaths from stroke in 1980 among those aged 35-74 years than might have been expected if the death rates had stayed the same as in 1970. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Surveys indicate that six million more people received antihypertensive medication in 1980 than in 1970. Results from a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials of the treatment of hypertension suggest that between 6% and 16% of the reduction in stroke mortality was due to the increased treatment of hypertension. Epidemiological observations indicate that between 16% and 25% of the overall decline in stroke mortality can be attributed to the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that clinical trials probably underestimate the community-wide benefits of treatment. These results also suggest that at least three quarters of the decline in stroke mortality in the United States in the period 1970-1980 is due to factors other than antihypertensive treatment.\r"

Because hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure, more common use of antihypertensive agents would be expected to reduce the incidence of congestive heart failure. Examination of the national death statistics reveals decreases in congestive heart failure mortality at younger ages with mortality increases at older ages. The reasons for these divergent trends in congestive heart failure mortality in different ages and the apparent inconsistency with respect to the changes in the use of antihypertensive drugs are explored. We speculate that antihypertensive treatment does not completely prevent congestive heart failure but merely postpones its development by several decades.\r"

  ".W": "The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program followed up 10,940 persons for 5 years in a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of treatment for hypertension. Participants were randomized to one of two treatment groups, stepped care and referred care. The primary end point of the study was all-cause mortality, with morbid events involving the heart, brain, and kidney as secondary end points. Loss of renal function, ascertained by a change in serum creatinine, was among these secondary events. Baseline serum creatinine concentration had a significant prognostic value for 8-year mortality. For persons with a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, 8-year mortality was more than three times that of all other participants. The estimated 5-year incidence of substantial decline in renal function was 21.7/1,000 in the stepped-care group and 24.6/1,000 in the referred-care group. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level between 1.5 and 1.7 mg/dl, the 5-year incidence of decline was 113.3/1,000 (stepped care) and 226.6/1,000 (referred care) (p less than 0.01). The incidence of decline in renal function was greater in men, blacks, and older adults, as well as in those with higher entry diastolic blood pressure. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, serum creatinine concentration declined by 25% or more in 28.6% of stepped-care and 25.2% of referred-care participants. Although the incidence of clinically significant hypercreatininemia in a hypertensive population is low, an elevated serum creatinine concentration is a very potent independent risk factor for mortality. The slightly lower rate of development of hypercreatininemia and the higher rate of improvement in stepped-care compared with referred-care participants is consistent with the belief that aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce renal damage and the associated increased risk of death.\r"

There was a strong inverse gradient of 5-year all-cause mortality with SES among the hypertensive participants referred to usual care in the HDFP. The association of mortality with SES among hypertensive subjects was eliminated by the HDFP stepped-care program. A large portion of the efficacy of the HDFP was associated with in-trial blood pressure control. Inasmuch as these results are generalizable to the nation, a large fraction of hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality in the United States was related to lower SES in the 1970s, before widespread implementation of programs resulting in increased awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension.\r"

Dietary measures should be effective in preventing the rise in blood pressure with age in civilized populations, but there are no firm data to substantiate this hypothesis. However, some data do suggest that weight loss and sodium restriction may benefit the drug-treated hypertensive patient. There are strong reasons to consider the use of nonpharmacological measures for the treatment of mild hypertension. Mild hypertension is ubiquitous. Some population subsets have a prevalence of mild hypertension approaching 40%, based on one blood pressure determination, for individuals older than 50 years. Even if the true prevalence is closer to 15%, this is a high proportion of the population in need of drug therapy. If a change in lifestyle could reduce the need for drug therapy by a respectable percentage, then an enormous number of individuals could be spared the necessity of taking antihypertensive medication.\r"

  ".W": "Release of melatonin into the circulation by the pineal occurs almost exclusively during the nighttime hours. It has been proposed that this daily rhythm, like that of body temperature, reflects the output of a central circadian pacemaker in humans. In order to investigate the relationship of the circadian rhythms of body temperature and melatonin in humans and compare their resetting responses to light, we characterized the endogenous 24-h profiles of these rhythms in eight young male adults during constant routines before and after exposure to a stimulus consisting of bright light, room light, and darkness/sleep. We found that the time of the fitted maximum of the endogenous melatonin rhythm consistently preceded the fitted temperature minimum by a mean +/- SE of 1.8 +/- 0.2 h. Bright-light exposure induced substantial and equivalent phase shifts of the melatonin and temperature rhythms (mean +/- SE difference in the phase-shifting response, 0.03 +/- 0.32 h), and the body temperature and melatonin rhythms thus maintained their usual phase relationship even after light-induced circadian phase inversion. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endogenous circadian components of both the plasma melatonin and body temperature rhythms are generated by a single central circadian pacemaker in humans. Furthermore, using the time of the fitted temperature minimum as a reference standard, we found that the fitted maximum of the endogenous 24-h melatonin profile was a more reliable phase marker than the onset of the nocturnal rise of melatonin (F = 4.48; P less than 0.01).\r"

Peripheral blood leukocyte DNA was obtained from 65 caucasian patients with Graves' disease, 63 caucasian patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 65 caucasian controls. RFLP analysis was carried out on genomic DNA, using probes for DR beta, DQ alpha, DQ beta, DP alpha, DP beta, T-cell receptor TCR alpha, and thyroid peroxidase. The methodology allowed HLA-DR and DQ typing and provided information on specific RFLP patterns related to T cell receptor (TCR)alpha, DP alpha and -beta, and -beta, and thyroid peroxidase. HLA-DR3 frequency was significantly increased in patients with Graves' disease, as reported previously by others, but neither DNA-derived subtype of DR3 was differentially increased. HLA-DQw2 was also present in increased frequency because of its linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR3. It is uncertain whether the primary susceptibility is with DQ, DR, or another nearby locus. Susceptibility was not related in these studies to genetic loci recognized in these studies involving DQ alpha, DP, TCR, or thyroid peroxidase. A significant linkage disequilibrium between DR3 and a specific DX alpha RFLP was observed in Graves' disease, but is believed to be representative of a generalized linkage disequilibrium between DR3 and DX alpha, rather than a specific abnormality in Graves' disease. Previous studies indicating association with specific TCR RFLPs could not be reproduced. The relative risk for carriers of HLA-DR3 subtype A in this study was 7.37-fold. RFLP analysis offers the possibility of investigating linkage in a variety of candidate genes as well as established genetic relationships for potentially important subtypes. While the significant relationship with HLA-DR3/DQw2 was reconfirmed, the involvement of other genes or haplotypes could not be established.\r"

It has been suggested that nonimmune processes are involved in SAT patients who have negative autoantibody titers. The disease has a variable course; although it is self-limited in most cases, some patients develop transient hypothyroidism, and others do not during the recovery period. The present study was performed to evaluate the occurrence of TSH receptor antibody (TRAb), measured by RRA (TSH binding inhibitor), TRAb measured by stimulation assay (thyroid-stimulating antibody), and TRAb measured by blocking assay [TSH-blocking antibody (TSH-BAb)] activity in 68 patients with SAT who had negative autoantibody titers. The patients were divided into 2 groups: group I, 31 patients who developed hypothyroidism during the recovery period; and group II, 37 patients who remained euthyroid during recovery. Positive immunoglobulin activity occurred in about 20% of group I patients during follow-up, but in only 3% of group II patients. About 20% of group I patients developed positive TSH-BAb activity and were hypothyroid, requiring exogenous hormone therapy for 1.2-3.5 yr, whereas hypothyroidism was relatively transient in group I patients who had negative TSH-BAb activity (2-6 months). Although increased TSH-BAb activity may account for hypothyroidism in some patients with SAT, the precise mechanism for the development of transient hypothyroidism in SAT remains enigmatic.\r"

  ".U": "91310747\r", 
  ".W": "The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationships between alpha 2-adrenergic and cholinergic pathways in the control of hypothalamic somatostatin (SRIF) secretion in humans. In eight normal volunteers subjects we compared the pattern of GHRH-induced GH release to that elicited by similar challenge given 60 min after a pretreatment with drugs affecting alpha 2-adrenergic and muscarinic cholinergic neurotransmission. In a control study, synthetic GHRH [GRF-(1-29); 1 microgram/kg, iv] was administered 60 min after giving placebo. In other experiments, the administration of atropine (1 mg, im), or clonidine (0.300 mg, orally), or atropine plus clonidine, or pyridostigmine (120 mg, orally), or yohimbine (30 mg, orally), or pyridostigmine plus yohimbine, at 0 min was followed by GHRH administration 60 min later. The administration of both clonidine and pyridostigmine significantly (P less than 0.01) enhanced the GH responses to GHRH compared to those elicited by this challenge when given after placebo. Conversely, atropine pretreatment significantly (P less than 0.01) blocked the GH response to GHRH challenge, whereas yohimbine did not significantly affect it. When atropine and clonidine were given together, the inhibitory effect of the former was overcame and mean GHRH-elicited GH peak response was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than that in the control study. In contrast, pretreatment with yohimbine significantly (P less than 0.05) blunted the pyridostigmine-induced enhancement of GHRH-elicited GH release. These data confirm our previous postulate suggesting that the stimulatory effect of clonidine on GH release is mainly exerted by inhibiting the hypothalamic SRIF release. Moreover, the effect of cholinergic neurons on SRIF release seems to be, at least in part, dependent on alpha 2-adrenergic pathways. Based on these data, it can be proposed that the alpha 2-adrenergic system plays a major role in the control of hypothalamic SRIF release, and hence in GH neuroregulation, whereas the muscarinic cholinergic system would participate in such regulation by modulating the functional activity of the former.\r"

ACTH and cortisol responses to exogenous CRH are blunted during pregnancy. In the present study we examined the pituitary-adrenal response to another corticotropin releasing factor, vasopressin. Studies were performed in chronically catheterized female baboons moving freely in their home cages; 13 studies were performed in 4 pregnant animals, and 8 studies were performed in 6 nonpregnant animals. Vasopressin was administered iv in 2 doses (0.3 and 3.0 U), and plasma samples were obtained for CRH, ACTH, and cortisol measurements. Results are expressed as the mean +/- SEM. Baseline plasma CRH was 240 +/- 20 pmol/L in the pregnant animals and unmeasurable (less than 20) in the nonpregnant animals. In the pregnant animals, ACTH concentrations rose from a baseline of 6.4 +/- 1.3 pmol/L to 10.1 +/- 0.4 after 0.3 U vasopressin and to 24.9 +/- 5.2 after 3.0 U vasopressin. In the nonpregnant animals, ACTH levels were 5.8 +/- 1.3 at baseline, 6.7 +/- 1.3 after the 0.3-U dose, and 14.6 +/- 2.4 after the 3.0-U dose. The peak ACTH response after each dose of vasopressin was higher in the pregnant animals than in the nonpregnant animals (P less than 0.05). The baseline cortisol level in the pregnant animals was 960 +/- 80 nmol/L and rose to 1370 +/- 110 and 1535 +/- 165 after the 2 doses of vasopressin, respectively. The baseline cortisol concentration in the nonpregnant animals was 910 +/- 86 nmol/L. The cortisol level was 990 +/- 75 after the 0.3-U vasopressin dose and 1380 +/- 140 after the 3.0-U dose. The peak cortisol response after the 0.3-U dose was significantly higher in the pregnant animals (P less than 0.02), while the peak cortisol responses after the 3.0-U dose were similar in the 2 groups of animals. In a single animal, vasopressin was administered sequentially at 4 gestational ages during pregnancy and then 2 times in the postpartum period. The ACTH response to vasopressin increased as pregnancy progressed and then decreased in the postpartum period. In summary, the ACTH and cortisol responses to 0.3 and 3.0 U vasopressin, iv, are enhanced during pregnancy in the baboon, although the responses to exogenous CRH are blunted during gestation. We conclude that the chronic placental CRH stimulation of the pituitary-adrenal axis during pregnancy leads to an enhanced response to vasopressin and a down-regulation of the response to exogenous CRH.\r"

The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) for [125I]Tyr0-oCRH ranged from 1.1-1.6 nM, and the receptor density was between 200-350 fmol/mg protein. Fixation of cryostat sections with 4% paraformaldehyde before tracer incubation improved both tissue preservation and localization of the CRH receptor at the cellular level. Additional postfixation with 1% glutaraldehyde inhibited tracer diffusion during subsequent immunocytochemistry and autoradiography. [125I]Tyr0-oCRH was found in cytoplasmic inclusions or at the cell periphery of ACTH/beta-endorphin cells in the anterior pituitary. Single cells of the posterior pituitary were also CRH receptor positive. Cells staining for PRL or GH were CRH receptor negative. We conclude that CRH binds only to high affinity receptors on ACTH/beta-endorphin cells in the human pituitary.\r"

Age at presentation of the MEN 1 trait averaged 18 yr in 7 previously unaffected individuals, and this effect of the screening procedure represented a lowering by almost 2 decades. Pancreatic endocrine involvement was recognized at a mean age of 25 yr and constituted the presenting lesion in a majority of the patients. A standardized meal test and basal values of serum pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, proinsulin, and gastrin were the most efficient markers for the pancreatic lesion and preceded signs of pancreatic tumors upon radiological examinations by a mean of 3.5 yr. A 75% penetrance of the islet cell disease and 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism within the affected individuals equalled the prevalences reported in autopsy studies. Two of the kindreds showed signs of intrafamilial homogeneity with respect to the profile of peptide excess (P less than 0.05) and considerable discrepancy in the malignant potential of the pancreatic lesions. The results of early detection and surgical intervention of the pancreatic tumors in MEN 1 suggested an impact on morbidity, while any effect on the mortality of these individuals remains to be clarified.\r"

The cytotrophoblasts were isolated by a trypsin-DNase method from first trimester and term placentas and purified on a Percoll gradient. In culture, these cells aggregated and fused together to form a syncytium. This in vitro differentiation was associated with a 2-fold increase in 125I-EGF binding after 48 h of culture. The addition of 0.1 microM PTH (PTH-treated cells) to the culture medium induced a significant 2- to 3-fold increase (P less than 0.005) in EGF binding. The effect was dose related with a maximum obtained at a 1 nM concentration. Scatchard analyses revealed that PTH-treated cells possess a 2-fold higher number of high affinity sites as compared to control cells from early placenta (0.71 +/- 0.06 pmol/mg protein and 0.34 +/- 0.04 pmol/mg protein, respectively) and from term placenta (1.24 +/- 0.10 pmol/mg protein and 0.61 +/- 0.07 pmol/mg protein, respectively). The apparent Kd values for high affinity sites (0.15 nM) and for low affinity sites (4 nM) were not altered either by the gestational age of the cells or by PTH treatment. With respect to the EGF-dependent phosphorylation in membranes of trophoblast cells in culture, it was found that the phosphorylation of two major proteins of 175 kilodaltons and 35 kilodaltons, is greatly increased in PTH-treated cell membranes in the presence of EGF. This PTH-induced effect on EGF receptors was associated with an augmented functional response of trophoblastic cells to EGF. PTH increased the EGF-stimulated secretion of hCG. These results demonstrate that PTH increases the number of biologically active EGF receptors during the in vitro differentiation of human trophoblast cells. This PTH-induced effect suggests a role for this hormone in the regulation of the growth and the endocrine functions of these cells.\r"

Human fetal Kupffer cells, the fixed tissue macrophages of the liver, may play a role as modulators of immune and endocrine function in early embryonic and fetal development. In the present study we isolated human fetal Kupffer cells to greater than 90% purity and prepared short term cultures to investigate the effect of glucocorticoids on the secretion of the cytokine TNF alpha. Fetal Kupffer cells secreted TNF alpha and IL-1 beta after culture with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), indicating that these cells express mature macrophage function. Cortisol and dexamethasone dramatically suppressed the LPS-stimulated secretion of TNF alpha by fetal Kupffer cells. The inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids appeared to be specific, since estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone had no effect on LPS stimulation of TNF alpha production. None of the steroids tested altered basal production or enhanced the LPS-stimulated production of TNF alpha by fetal Kupffer cells. The inhibition by glucocorticoids could be reversed by the addition of RU 486, indicating that this effect was mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. These results demonstrate that human fetal macrophages demonstrate mature macrophage function in early gestation; they can be activated to produce TNF alpha by a well characterized modulator of cellular function (LPS) and suppressed by glucocorticoids.\r"

After the fourth hour of each infusion, when plasma concentrations of ovine CRH were sufficiently elevated to saturate the capacity of the corticotroph to respond further to CRH, each subject completed a high intensity intermittent run. Plasma ACTH and cortisol levels increased significantly during the CRH infusion from 4.6 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- SE) to 8.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/L and from 361 +/- 39 to 662 +/- 70 nmol/L, respectively (P less than 0.05). Despite elevated preexercise cortisol levels during the CRH infusion, plasma ACTH rose to 32.0 +/- 8.5 pmol/L after exercise. During the saline infusion, plasma ACTH rose from 3.4 +/- 0.6 pmol/L before exercise to 18.1 +/- 4.2 after exercise. Time-integrated responses for postexercise values of ACTH and cortisol were higher during the CRH infusion than during the saline infusion (P less than 0.05). No significant exercise-induced differences in heart rate or plasma concentrations of lactate, epinephrine, and norepinephrine were observed between the two tests. The findings suggest that some factor(s) in addition to CRH causes ACTH release during exercise. Vasopressin, produced by the magnocellular and/or parvocellular neurons of the hypothalamus, is a likely candidate.\r"

  ".W": "GH-releasing peptide (GHRP; His-D-Trp-Ala-Trp-D-Phe-Lys-NH2), a hexapeptide derived from enkephalin, has been shown to have GH-releasing activity in man and several animal species. To characterize the GHRP dose-response curve and compare it with that of GH-releasing hormone [GHRH-(1-44)NH2], six unanesthetized young adult cynomolgus macaques were tested with a range of iv doses of GHRP or GHRH in random order. Animals were fitted with vests and tethers. Blood samples were obtained before and at 15-min intervals after the administration of drugs. Doses ranged from 0.03-3 mg/kg for GHRP and from 1-30 micrograms/kg for GHRH. The dose-response curves for the two peptides were not parallel. GHRP had lower potency, but evoked a much higher peak GH response than GHRH (greater than 55 vs. 12 micrograms/L). Because one of the proposed mechanisms of action of GHRP is the inhibition of somatostatin (SS), we tested the effects of propranolol, which inhibits SS, on the GH responses to GHRH and GHRP. Propranolol was given at a dose of 14 micrograms/kg, iv, 10 min before the injection of saline, GHRH (10 micrograms/kg), or GHRP (1 mg/kg). GH responses to propranolol alone did not differ from those to placebo (peak, 6 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 2 micrograms/L). However, propranolol pretreatment doubled the GH responses to both GHRH and GHRP compared with those to GHRH or GHRP alone 28 +/- 5 micrograms/L vs. 14 +/- 5 (P less than 0.05) and 54 +/- 2 vs. 25 +/- 6 micrograms/L (P less than 0.001), respectively]. These results show that GHRP causes a potent dose-dependent release of GH in this primate species. Since GHRP can produce a greater maximal GH response than GHRH, mechanisms other than release of endogenous GHRH must be involved.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the coding segment of the androgen receptor gene in a patient (N105) with the receptor-negative form of complete testicular feminization has revealed a single substitution (CGC----TGC) at nucleotide 2476. This alteration results in the conversion of an arginine at amino acid 772 to a cysteine. Introduction of this mutation into an androgen receptor cDNA and transfection of the mutant cDNA into COS cells result in the production of a receptor protein with an alteration in the apparent Kd of ligand binding (3 nM) compared to that of the normal androgen receptor (0.5 nM). The mutant receptor protein predicted for patient N105 also demonstrates thermal instability of ligand binding that is not associated with quantitative or qualitative changes in the immunoreactive androgen receptor protein. When assayed in cotransfection experiments using a mouse mammary tumor virus-chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter system, the N105 receptor protein appears to be about a tenth as active as the control receptor. These functional characteristics do not appear sufficient to account for the phenotype of complete testicular feminization and do not explain the profound deficiency of androgen receptor in cultured skin fibroblasts. Quantitative S1 nuclease protection assays reveal that the level of androgen receptor mRNA in fibroblasts from patient N105 is markedly reduced. These results suggest that the phenotype in patient N105 is due to two effects of the nucleotide substitution at residue 2476: the replacement of a crucial amino acid (772) in the hormone-binding domain that impairs the function of any receptor molecules formed and a decrease in the level of androgen receptor mRNA.\r"

  ".U": "91310759\r", 
  ".W": "The regulation of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 beta HSD) was studied in cultured human skin fibroblasts. 11-Oxo-reductase activity was 5- to 10-fold higher than 11 beta-dehydrogenase activity. Cells treated with 100 nM dexamethasone (Dex) showed a 3-fold increase in the maximum velocity of both activities without a change in the Km values. Dex induction of 11 beta HSD was half-maximal at 48 h and was blocked by glucocorticoid receptor antagonists. Nonglucocorticoid steroids were ineffective. Removal of serum from the culture medium increased maximum velocity values up to 6-fold. Treatment of cells grown in the absence of serum with 8-bromo-cAMP, phorbol esters, or insulin decreased both 11 beta HSD activities. The effects of Dex treatment and serum removal were additive and were blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin-D. In all experiments both 11 beta HSD activities were modulated in parallel. Both cortisone (200 nM) and cortisol increased the aromatase activity of fibroblasts in the presence of serum. Prior induction of 11 beta HSD by serum removal increased the potency of cortisone from 10-15% to 50% that of cortisol. We conclude that 1) in human fibroblasts 11 beta HSD appears to be a single protein that is under multifactorial regulation; 2) 11 beta HSD may increase or decrease cortisol availability to glucocorticoid receptors; and 3) plasma cortisone levels may be important in assessing glucocorticoid status.\r"

  ".W": "The relative anatomical distribution of adipose tissue in central (abdominal) vs. peripheral (extremity) depots is highly correlated with the risk of adiposity-related morbidities, such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. In adults, comparisons of the functional status of plasma membrane adrenergic receptors indicate that abdominal adipocytes are more responsive to the lipolytic action of beta 1-adrenergic agonists, while gluteal adipocytes are more responsive to the antilipolytic action of alpha 2-adrenergic agonists. To determine whether such regional differences in adipocyte adrenoreceptor status are present before puberty, we obtained needle biopsy samples of abdominal and gluteal sc adipose tissue in the post-absorptive state from 13 prepubertal children and 47 adults of varying body compositions (obese vs. lean). Lipolysis rates were measured in the basal state and in the presence of 10(-7) M norepinephrine (a mixed alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist) and 10(-7) M isoproterenol (a beta-adrenergic agonist). In children, there were no significant regional differences in either the basal rate of lipolysis or the responses to adrenergic lipolytic and antilipolytic stimuli. In lean and obese adults, gluteal sc adipose tissue was strikingly more responsive to antilipolytic alpha-adrenergic stimulation (P less than 0.0001) and less responsive to lipolytic beta-adrenergic stimuli (P less than 0.005) compared to abdominal tissue. Abdominal sc adipocytes from children had a significantly lower rate of basal lipolysis (P less than 0.01) and were more responsive to alpha 2-adrenergic (antilipolytic) stimuli (P less than 0.05) than abdominal adipocytes in adults. These results suggest that peripubertal endocrine changes may mediate the striking regional differences in adrenoreceptor status of adult adipose tissue, and that a decrease in the preponderance of alpha 2-receptors (antilipolytic) in abdominal adipose tissue may account in part for the relative loss of central vs. peripheral fat that occurs during puberty.\r"

  ".W": "Specific binding of hGH to liver microsomes of nonpregnant women and men is low, usually 10% of less in RRA. In pregnant women, however, we found that this binding is 10 times higher. The binding reaction shared the properties common to receptor systems: time, temperature and cation dependence, saturability and reversibility, hGH specific binding without cations was 10 times lower. The cross-reactions of hPRL and human placental lactogen with hGH were 0.49 +/- 0.16% and 0.10 +/- 0.05%, respectively. 125I-hPRL and 125I-human placental lactogen binding to microsomes of two controls and two pregnant women were very low and poorly reproducible. The Scatchard analysis revealed two hGH binding sites, one with an association constant (KA) of 2.7 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) M-1, and the other with a KA of 1.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(9) M-1. In one nonpregnant woman, we found a single hGH binding site with a KA of 1.5 x 10(9) M-1, confirming results previously reported in the literature. A hGH RRA was set up with microsomes of pregnant women. Acromegalic sera produced curves parallel to the hGH standard and pituitary dwarf serum had no 125I-hGH displacing activity. Sera of pregnant women produced curves divergent to the hGH standard and showed a 125I-hGH displacing activity 20 to 40 times higher than could be predicted by hGH levels determined by RIA. Cord sera and sera from puerperal women had similar hGH levels as determined by either RRA or RIA (r = 0.93, P less than 0.001, slope = 0.85, n = 25). Our results show the existence of specific GH receptors and serum factor(s) with high 125I-hGH displacing activity from these receptors in pregnancy. These findings must be related to several metabolic changes of pregnancy, such as glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia, increased lipolysis, and ketogenesis.\r"

We evaluated the hypothesis that girls with Turner's syndrome may have deficient bone density before the expected age of pubertal onset (9-13 yr) by comparing the bone mineral content of the wrist and lumbar spine in 78 girls with Turner's syndrome (4-13 yr old) and 28 normal prepubertal girls who were matched for age, bone age, body mass index, or height age. The bone mineral content of the wrist and spine was measured by single photon absorptiometry (SPA) and dual photon absorptiometry (DPA), respectively. SPA values for girls with Turner's syndrome vs. normal subjects (4-6.9, 7-9.9, and 10-12.9 yr old) were (mean +/- SD) 0.27 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.36 +/- 0.05, 0.35 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.41 +/- 0.06, and 0.41 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.45 +/- 0.03 g/cm2, respectively. SPA values in the Turner's syndrome girls were decreased compared to those in normal prepubertal girls, matched for age (P less than 0.0001), bone age, (P less than 0.001), and body mass index (BMI; P less than 0.0001), but not for height age. DPA values for girls with Turner's syndrome vs. normal girls in the same age categories were 0.65 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.09, 0.77 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.79 +/- 0.09, and 0.83 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.07 g/cm2. DPA values in Turner's syndrome girls (as a group) were decreased compared to those in normal prepubertal girls matched for age (P less than 0.05) and BMI (P less than 0.02), but not for bone age or height age. The annual incidence rate of wrist fractures in Turner's syndrome girls (9.1 of 1000) was significantly increased compared to the reported annual incidence rate in normal children (3.5 of 1000; P less than 0.003). We conclude that prepubertal-aged girls with Turner's syndrome (less than 13 yr old) have normal bone density for height age, but significantly decreased bone density of the wrist for chronological age, bone age, and BMI. They also have significantly more wrist fractures than normal girls, but it is not clear that this is related to their bone density.\r"

Serum OC levels were measured during an 8-h iv infusion of SMS and during a similar infusion of isotonic saline (control night) in five young women (mean age +/- SE, 21 +/- 2 yr). SMS significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased secretion of endogenous GH. The mean increases in serum OC concentration were similar during SMS infusion and control nights. Furthermore, the nocturnal pattern of increase in serum OC levels during GH or saline infusions did not differ. From these data, we conclude that the nocturnal increases in serum OC and GH levels are not related.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-three postmenopausal women were assigned to four treatment groups and received either Premarin or percutaneous 17 beta-estradiol (Oestrogel) alone or in combination with micronized progesterone (Utrogentan). The oral administration of estrogen alone to hysterectomized women resulted in: 1) a significant increase in triglyceride levels in plasma and all major lipoprotein fractions, 2) a significant increase in very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, 3) a significant decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol but not LDL apo B concentration, 4) a significant increase in all the lipid components of high density lipoprotein (HDL) as well as apo AI, 5) and a significant increase in HDL2 cholesterol. In contrast, percutaneous administration of estrogen to hysterectomized women only increased HDL2 cholesterol and the triglyceride and cholesterol content of the whole HDL fraction. These results suggest that the route of estrogen administration is important in determining effects on lipoprotein metabolism. The same two estrogens were given to women with natural menopause, along with utrogestan, a micronized progesterone. The simultaneous administration of Utrogestan reversed the HDL cholesterol elevating effect of percutaneous estrogen alone, but it had no effect on other plasma lipoproteins. On the other hand, utrogestan in combination with oral estrogen had several potential beneficial effects on plasma lipoproteins. This combination did not negate the effects of oral estrogen alone on HDL, rather it further increased the concentrations of HDL cholesterol and apo AI. It also did not negate the LDL cholesterol lowering effect of oral estrogen alone. Furthermore, utrogestan lowered the magnitude of hypertriglyceridemia induced by oral estrogen alone. These results suggest that Utrogestan has lower potency of androgenic action and has desirable effects when given in cyclic combination with estrogen.\r"

Each patient received, in a blinded random fashion, a series of 5 1-h ACTH tests. For each test a different dose of ACTH-(1-24) was administered, ranging from 0-1 microgram/kg, given as an iv bolus. Blood samples were collected 0, 10, 30, and 60 min after ACTH bolus injection. Patients with acne had slightly higher concentrations of basal cortisol, delta 4-androstenedione, and DHEA than normal controls (P less than 0.05). After ACTH-(1-24) stimulation, the same patients had greater peak and time-integrated DHEA concentrations (P less than 0.03). The ED50 values of the cortisol dose-response curves were similar in patients and normal women (P less than 0.05), suggesting that there are no differences in the sensitivity of the adrenal cortex to ACTH between the acne patients and the controls studied. The ratio of DHEA to cortisol response was significantly elevated in women with acne compared to that in control women, suggesting some preponderance of the delta 5 pathway of steroidogenesis in acne (P less than 0.05). These findings of basal and ACTH-stimulated hypersecretion of delta 5-androgens in patients with postaldolescent acne are consistent with an increased volume of androgen-secreting tissue, rather than hypersensitivity of the adrenal zona reticularis to ACTH.\r"

  ".W": "Developmental changes in basal and circadian fluctuations in plasma dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and cortisol (F) from birth until 3 months of life were studied in conjunction with morphological characteristics of the fetal and neonatal adrenal cortex in baboons (Papio anubis). These studies were complimented by measurements of in vitro production of DHEAS and F (basal and ACTH stimulated) by adrenal tissue slices. Cortisol, DHEAS, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone were determined in plasma and incubation medium by specific RIA. After delivery, an initial rise in plasma DHEAS was sustained for 4 days, followed by a precipitous decline, which reached a nadir between days 10-12 postpartum. Thereafter, plasma DHEAS and F concentrations stabilized with minor fluctuations. A significant (P less than 0.05) and persistent diurnal rhythm in DHEAS and F secretion was evident by the end of the first week after birth. Administration of estrone acetate and progesterone in oil maintained neonatal plasma concentrations of estrone, estradiol, and progesterone at levels comparable to those in utero, but had no quantitative or qualitative effect on the pattern of plasma DHEAS or F in the neonate. The relative production of F to DHEAS by tissue slices in vitro (the calculated F/DHEAS ratios) indicates that DHEAS secretion by the fetal adrenal is 10-fold higher than that of F near parturition; ACTH stimulation does not alter this relationship. By postnatal day 10, the basal production rates of F and DHEAS are equivalent, and the response to ACTH stimulation favors production of F. With advancing neonatal age (at 30 and 100 days), there is an increase in the F/DHEAS secretion ratio both during the basal state and in response to ACTH. The baboon adrenal glands increased in weight during the last month of gestation and then stabilized during the early postnatal period; a gradual increase in weight was observed after 30 days postpartum. Within 2 weeks after parturition, the relative width of the fetal zone decreased dramatically to occupy less than one third of the total cortex. During involution, we observed a decrease in cell size and a reduction in cytoplasmic vacuolation. A zone of closely packed cells with numerous areas of cell death (the dense band) separated the zona fasciculata from the fetal zone. Cell proliferation was observed in the upper regions of the definitive cortex. We conclude the following. 1) The hypothalamic-hypophyseal mechanisms that regulate the diurnal adrenal secretory rhythm are established in the early neonatal period in the baboon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

We studied the roles of these three groups of proteins in prostate epithelial cells (PEC) in primary culture grown under serum-free conditions. Affinity cross-linking of IGF-I and IGF-II to crude membranes prepared from PEC revealed an abundance of type 1 IGF receptors and no evidence of type 2 IGF receptors. Western ligand blots of conditioned media (CM) from PEC demonstrated the presence of two specific IGFBP bands similar to those previously demonstrated in seminal plasma, with approximate mol wt of 31 and 24 kDa. The 31-kDa band was immunoprecipitable with an antibody to IGFBP-2, and neither band could be deglycosylated with endoglycosidase-F. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA prepared from PEC with cDNAs for hIGFBP-1, -2, and -3 documented the expression of mRNA for hIGFBP-2 only. Modifications of the serum-free conditions of PEC did not significantly alter the IGFBP profile of PEC CM. The ability of IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin to stimulate clonal growth of PEC was examined. IGF-I stimulated PEC growth with an ED50 of 0.1 ng/mL. IGF-II and insulin, respectively, were 1 and 3 orders of magnitude less effective than IGF-I in stimulating the growth of PEC. Radioimmunoassayable IGF-I and IGF-II levels in PEC CM were below the assay detection levels. In conclusion, we suggest that IGFs are important growth stimulators of PEC in culture, that their actions are mediated through the type 1 IGF receptor, and that PEC produce hIGFBP-2 and a 24-kDa IGFBP which may modulate IGF action in these cells.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, biochemical, and radiographic features of ectopic ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome are often indistinguishable from those of pituitary ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism (Cushing's disease). We prospectively evaluated 29 patients with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism by means of bilateral inferior petrosal sinus ACTH sampling with ovine CRH (oCRH) stimulation. Patients with Cushing's disease (n = 20), had a maximal basal inferior petrosal sinus to peripheral ACTH ratio (IPS:P-ACTH) of 11.7 +/- 4.4 (+/- SE) from the dominant IPS, which increased to 50.8 +/- 18.3 after oCRH administration. Bilateral IPS sampling was necessary to correctly identify patients with Cushing's disease, since the maximal basal nondominant IPS:P-ACTH was less than 2.0 in over 50% of the patients and remained less than 2.0 after oCRH administration in one third. In contrast, patients with occult ectopic ACTH-secreting neoplasms (n = 9) had maximal basal IPS:P-ACTH of 1.2 +/- 0.1 that did not change after oCRH administration. Occult ectopic ACTH-secreting neoplasms were found in 7 of 9 patients from 0.4-14 yr after the recognition of Cushing's syndrome, and 4 of these patients had intermittent hypercortisolism with prolonged periods of remission. Selective endobronchial lavage for ACTH correctly localized a radiologically occult ACTH-secreting bronchial carcinoid in 1 patient, and magnetic resonance imaging identified a similar neoplasm in a patient with a normal chest computed tomographic scan. Basal ACTH and urinary free cortisol excretion were significantly higher in patients with ectopic ACTH than in those with Cushing's disease, but overlap existed between groups. High dose dexamethasone suppression testing inaccurately classified 24% of patients, and radiological imaging of the pituitary and adrenal glands was misleading. The occult ectopic ACTH syndrome is a common form of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism that cannot be distinguished from Cushing's disease with routine clinical studies. The accurate differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome requires bilateral inferior petrosal sinus ACTH sampling with oCRH stimulation.\r"

  ".W": "Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression is not restricted to the pituitary corticotroph cell, but also takes place in many normal and tumoral nonpituitary tissues. In contrast, the ectopic ACTH syndrome is a rare event. Because it is most often associated with lung tumors, we specifically studied this tissue, analyzing the different forms of POMC RNAs in normal specimens as well as in various types of tumors. The endocrine nature of the tumors was assessed by both histological examination and measurements of secretogranin-I fragments in the tissue extracts. POMC RNA was first detected by Northern blot analysis; its absolute amounts and its various molecular forms were more precisely quantified and discriminated by S1 mapping studies using a single stranded DNA probe located at the 5' end of exon 3. In five bronchial carcinoid tumors associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, a highly predominant, if not single, POMC RNA identical to the 1200-nucleotide (nt) pituitary message was present, the high amounts of which were correlated with those of POMC peptides in the same tissues. In five bronchial carcinoid tumors not associated with the ectopic ACTH syndrome, the same message was detected (four of five), with a second, often predominant, short RNA of about 800 nt (five of five), and the overall amounts of POMC RNAs were low. Similar patterns of POMC RNAs were observed in squamous cell tumors, adenocarcinomas, and normal lung, where the short 800-nt RNA tended to be predominant. These results show that POMC gene expression can be demonstrated in normal lung tissue and in all types of lung tumors. The ectopic ACTH syndrome only occurs with tumors capable of generating high amounts of the pituitary-like message, a phenomenon that seems to be restricted to an occasional tumor with features of neuroendocrine differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that GH secretion increases during puberty, we measured GH levels in samples obtained every 20 min for 24 h from 132 normal children and adolescents. In both girls and boys, GH levels increased during puberty. The increase in mean levels was earlier in girls than boys, was most evident at night, and was due to increased pulse amplitude rather than a change in pulse frequency. The mean nighttime GH level in girls with bone ages (BA) greater than 12 to 14 yr were significantly greater than the mean level in girls with BA less than 8 yr (7.3 +/- 3.0 vs. 3.4 +/- 1.7 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01) and were greatest at breast stage 3 (7.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/L). GH pulse amplitude increased significantly before pubertal onset in girls and was significantly greater at BA greater than 12 to 14 yr than at BA of 8 yr or less (13.9 +/- 6.0 vs. 7.9 +/- 4.8 micrograms/L; P less than 0.01) and greatest at breast stage 3 (15.0 +/- 6.3 micrograms/L). The pubertal increase in GH secretion was delayed in boys compared to girls, with the lowest mean 24-h GH and mean nighttime GH values in boys with BA greater than 8 to 11 yr. The mean nighttime GH level at BA greater than 11 to 13 yr in boys was significantly greater than that in the boys with BA greater than 8 to 11 yr (5.8 +/- 2.9 vs. 3.5 +/- 2.1 micrograms/L; P less than 0.05) and was greatest at a testicular volume of more than 10 to 15 mL (6.5 +/- 2.0 micrograms/L). The mean nighttime GH pulse amplitude in boys was significantly greater at BA greater than 11 to 13 yr than at BA greater than 8 to 11 yr (13.9 +/- 5.7vs. 7.3 + 2.6 micrograms/L, P less than 0.05) and was greatest at a testicular volume greater than 20 mL (15.8 +/- 12.0 micrograms/L). The mean nighttime GH levels correlated inversely with body mass index in both sexes, although the correlation achieved statistical significance only for the girls, being stronger in breast stage 3 to 5 girls (r = -0.57 P = 0.0007; n = 32) than in stage 1 and 2 girls (r = -0.38; P = 0.03; n = 32). These observations in normal adolescents emphasize the importance of interpreting spontaneous GH levels in short children in relation to normative data appropriate for sex, body mass, and bone age or pubertal stage.\r"

Amnion is contiguous with chorion and plays a part in the mechanism(s) of parturition through increased prostaglandin (PG) production. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether renin has any action on amnion cell PGE2 biosynthesis. Amnion cells in primary monolayer culture were incubated for 16 h with increasing concentrations of renin. Renin induced a concentration-dependent increase in amnion cell PGE2 production (e.g. in picograms of PGE2 per microgram protein/16 h; mean +/- SEM; n = 4; control, 3.01 +/- 0.15; 0.0001 U/mL renin, 9.66 +/- 2.0; 0.001 U/mL renin, 10.36 +/- 1.91; 0.01 U/mL renin, 10.3 +/- 3.36; 0.1 U/mL renin, 13.82 +/- 2.1). Significant stimulation of amnion cell PGE2 by renin is not observed until 2 h of incubation; stimulation continues a further 6 h, with little change in the following 8 h. We tested the possibility that renin's stimulatory effects were due to angiotensin-I (AI) and angiotensin-II (AII) formation by testing the effects of AI and AII directly and that of renin in the presence of saralasin, a potent antagonist of AII action. Saralasin did not inhibit the effect of renin, nor was AI or AII alone (10(-10)-10(-6) M) stimulatory. Thus, we believe that chorionic renin may have a novel role in the regulation of amnion cell PGE2 production that is independent of angiotensin formation.\r"

  ".W": "Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) circulate in a complexed state with several binding proteins (BPs). Of these, IGFBP-1 is regulated by hormonal and nutritional factors. The somatostatin analogue, octreotide, has been used to effectively control hypersomaototropism in acromegaly. IGFBP-1 levels were measured by RIA in 17 acromegalic patients receiving octreotide. Serum hormone sampling was conducted hourly for 8 hr periods. Among 13 octreotide responders, mean pre-treatment basal GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-1 levels were 19 +/- 5 micrograms/L, 1021 +/- 168 micrograms/L, and 36 +/- 8 micrograms/L respectively. One month following octreotide treatment, an acute subcutaneous injection (100 micrograms) maximally attenuated GH to 3 +/- 0.6 microgram/L (18% of control, P less than 0.03) and IGF-1 to 467 +/- 75 micrograms/L (46% of control, P less than 0.008) after 4 hrs. IGFBP-1 levels, however, were stimulated to 95 +/- 16 micrograms/L (297% of control, P less than 0.003) during the same time period. A significant increase in IGFBP-1 levels occurred within 2 hrs (158% of baseline, P less than 0.03), and was sustained until the 7th hr following injection. Insulin, a known suppressor of IGFBP-1, did not change during this time. Among the 4 octreotide non-responders, mean basal IGFBP-1 levels were 42 +/- 4 micrograms/L, and 4 hrs following octreotide administration IGFBP-1 was 40 +/- 7 micrograms/L. Octreotide induced a dynamic inverse relationship between circulating GH and IGFBP-1 levels (r = -0.73, P less than 0.001). The absence of IGFBP-1 changes in octreotide non-responders and the non-suppression of insulin in octreotide responsive patients, suggest a direct GH-mediated mechanism of IGFBP-1 regulation in octreotide treated patients with acromegaly. IGFBP-1 may be another useful marker in evaluating the response of acromegaly to octreotide treatment in patients who experience clinical benefit but equivocal GH and IGF-1 attenuation.\r"

Seventy five specimens were positive for intrahepatic nuclear antigen for HDV antigen accompanied by cytoplasmic HDV antigen in only one biopsy specimen. This group had significantly higher serum transaminase activities and inflammatory activity than the remaining cases that were negative for HDV antigen. Among the group positive for HDV antigen, there was no correlation between the proportion of hepatocytes containing HDV antigen and either serum transaminase activity or histological inflammatory indices. In 22 HDV antigen positive patients who had follow up biopsy specimens taken at a median of two years, the proportion with cirrhosis increased from 36% to 73%. Serum transaminase activities remained the same during this period, but the proportion of HDV antigen positive cells dropped. Follow up of 51 patients showed that 21 died or underwent liver transplantation within three years. The absence of an association between intrahepatic HDV antigen expression and progression of histological liver damage does not support the view that HDV is directly cytopathic to hepatocytes. Immune mediated mechanisms may have a role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease related to HDV infection.\r"

No association was observed between pre-S polypeptide expression and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication or disease severity.

In all eight cases the organism was identified at light microscopy without prior knowledge of the electron microscopical findings. All stages of the life cycle are best seen in resin sections cut at 1 micron and stained with Giemsa, but spores could easily be identified in paraffin sections cut at 5 microns and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. In all cases the parasite was identified both in duodenal pinch and jejunal \"Crosby\" capsule biopsy specimens. All cases of microsporidiosis occurred in patients with diarrhoea. Both electron and light microscopical examination suggested that the pathogenic mechanism involves the shedding of infected enterocytes containing large numbers of spores. It is suggested that the optimal way to diagnose microsporidiosis is by light microscopical examination of duodenal pinch biopsy specimens.\r"

Only 8.3% carcinoids were negative with both prealbumin and Grimelius stains. Ten squamous, 10 adeno- and 10 small cell carcinomas showed only occasional scattered prealbumin positive cells.

None of an age matched control group without endocardial fibroelastosis had evidence of congestive cardiac failure.

NCAMs are a family of closely related cell surface glycoproteins involved in cell-cell interactions. Using antibodies that recognise distinct epitopes on NCAM, their presence was shown in neuroblastoma, but these studies do not yield any information on the specific NCAM isoforms associated with the tumour. Western and Northern blot analyses were therefore carried out to characterise the NCAM isoforms in this neuroectodermal tumour. Western blot studies using the monoclonal antibody ERIC-1 showed that all human neuroblastoma cell lines tested expressed the 140 and 120 kilodalton isoforms of NCAM in their desialo state. Some of the cell lines also expressed NCAM-180. The data are corroborated by Northern blotting where a transcript of 7.4 kilobase pairs was identified only in lines expressing NCAM-180; the 6.7 and 5.4 kilobase pair transcripts coding for 140 and 120 kilodalton isoforms, respectively, were present in all the cell lines tested. The NCAM isoforms identified in neuroblastoma were also different from those found in adult and fetal brain tissue, suggesting that aberrations are expressed in the molecule during tumorigenesis.\r"

All other biopsy specimens from marrow recipients taken before or after transplantation were similar to those of normal controls even in the presence of a clinical rash consistent with early GvHD. Although VCAM-1 positivity was seen on a few endothelial cells in normal skin, staining was mainly observed on dermal dendritic cells surrounding blood vessels and adnexal structures. In specimens with histological evidence of GvHD, positive perivascular dendritic cells were increased and were accompanied by the appearance of large numbers of similar cells dispersed throughout the upper dermis. Biopsy specimens from marrow recipients before and after transplantation resembled those from normal donors except for the presence of a rash after transplantation when some specimens, which lacked the leucocytic infiltrate diagnostic of GvHD, showed an increase in VCAM-1 positive cells, particularly in the upper dermis. The identification of these cells may therefore be useful in diagnosing early GvHD.\r"

The new assay correlated well with a more conventional \"tube\" assay and was not influenced by the presence of antibiotics in serum. Evaluation of assay performance showed excellent interassay and intra-assay precision with quantitative recovery of added cyanocobalamin over a wide range of additions (94.9%-102.1%). The advantages of short incubation time, easy reading, and minimal reagent costs make this assay an attractive option in the routine clinical laboratory and in research.\r"

Both markers were significantly raised in all categories of infection compared with controls, and there were significant differences between the means of both markers when comparing several of the categories of infection. Only C-reactive protein concentrations in bacteraemic patients, however, were both sensitive and specific at distinguishing the type of infection. The additional use of neopterin estimation played only a minor part in increasing the specificity of diagnosis in tuberculosis and in viral infections. On the basis of this study it was not considered worth the time and expense of performing neopterin assays in addition to C-reactive protein estimations to differentiate viral from bacterial infection.\r"

Adherence of S aureus to mesothelial monolayers increased significantly when the bacteria were opsonised with pooled human serum, but phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes occurred independently. Phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages, however, was only marginal. Pretreatment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils with inhibitors of cellular metabolism and motility reduced their phagocytic capacity. These results indicate that the surface of mesothelial cells provides favourable conditions for the elimination of staphylococci in the peritoneal cavity. Phagocytic motility seems to be important in surface phagocytosis. The inability of peritoneal macrophages to phagocytise staphylococci adherent to the mesothelial cells suggests that they contribute little to the antibacterial defence of the peritoneal membrane of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.\r"

Further purification of the DNA can then be carried out in a laboratory with facilities for ultracentrifugation by banding the DNA through cesium chloride.

In the multiple myeloma group all but one patient had a high LAP score, irrespective of disease. No cause for raised LAP, such as infection, was present in any of the patients with multiple myeloma. In the MGUS group six patients had a raised LAP score; in two of them another cause for such a rise was present (autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and primary thrombocythaemia). In neither group did the LAP score correlate with duration of the disease, bone marrow plasma cell count, paraprotein concentration, haemoglobin, total white cell or neutrophil count. It is concluded that a normal LAP count in patients with paraproteinaemia suggests a benign condition, but a raised count does not indicate a malignant condition.\r"

Two out of five patients with erythema migrans, the characteristic primary skin lesion associated with early Lyme disease, were positive by the PCR.

H pylori positive patients with and without duodenal ulceration had significantly lower gastric histamine concentrations than H pylori negative subjects. The lower gastric histamine concentration observed in H pylori positive patients might be due to increased histamine release which could in turn induce increased gastric acid secretion.\r"

  ".W": "In a recent prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole was not associated with a reduction in the rate of restenosis within the 1st 6 months after coronary angioplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether clinical, anatomic or procedural factors were predictive of the observed restenosis rates in that prospective trial. A total of 247 patients and 280 segments underwent follow-up angiography and quantitative coronary angiographic analysis between 4 and 7 months after coronary angioplasty. Two baseline clinical characteristics--angina class and duration of angina in months--were related to the rate of restenosis by univariate analysis. Patient-related stepwise logistic regression analysis identified severity of angina as the only clinical predictor of restenosis. Three univariate baseline anatomic characteristics--percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty, stenosis greater than 10 mm in length and calcific stenosis--and two early postangioplasty characteristics--residual percent diameter stenosis and residual mean pressure gradient--were predictive of restenosis. Of these, only two--length of stenosis and residual percent diameter stenosis--were independently related to restenosis by multivariate analysis and only the former is identifiable before the procedure. It is concluded that in prospective studies in contrast to retrospective studies, few clinical and anatomic factors appear to be predictive of restenosis after coronary angioplasty.\r"

A control group consisting of registry patients with an ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.45 who did not have heart failure was used for comparison. Patients who had heart failure were older and more likely to be female and to have a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes and chronic lung disease than registry patients who did not have heart failure. As a group, patients with heart failure had more severe angina and were more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction than were registry patients without heart failure. At 6 year follow-up, 82% of patients in the heart failure group survived compared with 91% of patients in the control group (p less than 0.0001). Multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model identified the following independent predictors of mortality: regional ventricular systolic dysfunction, number of diseased coronary arteries, advanced age, hypertension, lung disease, diabetes, increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and heart failure symptoms. Among patients with heart failure, the 6-year survival rate of those who had three-vessel coronary artery disease was 68% compared with 92% for the group without coronary artery disease. However, the 6-year survival rate for patients with heart failure who underwent surgical revascularization of diseased coronary arteries was not significantly improved compared with that of patients treated medically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Dopexamine hydrochloride is a new synthetic catechol that offers a unique profile of adrenergic and dopaminergic activity. In this multicenter, parallel design, placebo-controlled study, 45 patients with functional class III or IV chronic congestive heart failure were randomized to receive a placebo infusion or one of three different doses of dopexamine. After a 2-h dose titration sequence, patients received a 6-h constant dose infusion. During this 6-h period, dopexamine was infused at rates of 1, 2 and 4 micrograms/kg body weight per min in the low, intermediate and high dose groups, respectively. In patients receiving high dose infusion, dopexamine produced a 78% increase in cardiac index associated with a 43% decrease in systemic vascular resistance and 24% increase in heart rate (p less than 0.05 vs. placebo for all three variables). There was a trend (p = NS) toward a moderate increase in cardiac index at low and intermediate doses. In patients randomized to receive dopexamine, right atrial, systemic arterial, pulmonary artery and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures showed minimal change from baseline and did not differ statistically from the placebo response. Very few patients developed adverse reactions related to dopexamine, although five patients randomized to receive high dose and three patients randomized to receive intermediate dose dopexamine required dose reduction because hemodynamic variables exceeded arbitrary safety limits or the patients developed symptoms related to the study medication. dopexamine in higher doses effectively increases cardiac index in association with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance. Additional clinical studies are indicated to evaluate the merits of dopexamine in comparison with other inotropic and vasodilator medications.\r"

Echocardiographic results were compared with the presence or absence of endocarditis determined by pathologic or nonechocardiographic data from the subsequent clinical course. All echocardiograms were interpreted by an observer told only that the studies were from patients in whom the diagnosis of endocarditis was suspected. The diagnosis of endocarditis was eventually made in 16 of the 66 episodes of suspected endocarditis (14 by pathologic and 2 by clinical criteria). In 7 of 16 transthoracic and 15 of 16 transesophageal echocardiograms, endocarditis was diagnosed at a probability level of \"almost certain,\" giving a sensitivity of 44% and 94%, respectively (p less than 0.01). For the remaining episodes, 49 of 50 transthoracic and all transesophageal studies yielded normal results, giving a specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. This study suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and significantly more sensitive than transthoracic echocardiography. Although echocardiography cannot rule out endocarditis, the high diagnostic sensitivity of transesophageal echocardiography results in a low probability of the disease when the study yields negative results in a patient with an intermediate likelihood of the disease.\r"

Left atrial spontaneous echo contrast was found in 75 patients (19%) and was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation, mitral stenosis, absence of mitral regurgitation, increased left atrial dimension and a history of suspected embolism. Seventy-one (95%) of the patients with spontaneous echo contrast had atrial fibrillation or mitral stenosis. Anticoagulant therapy had no significant association with spontaneous echo contrast. Multivariate analysis in 89 patients with mitral stenosis or mitral valve replacement showed that spontaneous echo contrast was the only independent predictor (p = 0.03) of left atrial thrombus or suspected embolism, or both. In 60 patients with atrial fibrillation of nonvalvular origin, spontaneous echo contrast (p = 0.01) and age (p = 0.03) were the only independent predictors of left atrial thrombus or suspected embolism, or both. It is concluded that left atrial spontaneous echo contrast is 1) a common finding in patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography, 2) associated with conditions favoring stasis of left atrial blood, and 3) a marker of previous thromboembolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and those with mitral stenosis or mitral valve replacement.\r"

All 50 patients had ST depression greater than or equal to 0.1 mV during exercise. A total of 241 episodes of ST depression were noted in the ambulatory setting in 31 patients; only 6% of these were accompanied by angina pectoris. Significant (0.1 mV) ST depression during ambulatory monitoring was preceded by a mean increase in heart rate of 27 +/- 12 beats/min. Patients with ischemia during daily activities developed ST depression earlier during exercise (7.9 +/- 4.4 vs. 14.2 +/- 6.4 min, p less than 0.001) and tended to have significant ECG changes at a lower exercise heart rate and rate-pressure product than did those without ST depression during ambulatory monitoring. In the 31 patients with ischemia during daily activities, the mean heart rate associated with ST depression in the ambulatory setting was closely correlated with the heart rate precipitating ECG changes during exercise testing (r = 0.74, p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study was designed to determine the clinical, hemodynamic and angiographic correlates of this observation. Data from 9,731 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization from 1976 through 1986 were analyzed; 5,531 had severe (greater than 70%) obstruction of at least one major coronary artery, 1,706 had mild (10 to 69%) obstruction and 2,494 had no obstruction. Of the patients with severe obstruction, 2,536 were treated medically and 2,995 were treated by surgical revascularization. Patients with an ST-T abnormality had more clinical risk factors (including older age and greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prior myocardial infarction) and greater left ventricular dysfunction (including higher end-diastolic pressure and ventricular volume, reduced ejection fraction and greater prevalence of contraction abnormality) than did those without this ECG pattern. Survival time was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in subsets of patients with an ST-T abnormality and with severe or mild coronary artery disease; in those without coronary disease, ST-T changes did not correlate with reduced survival. Stepwise regression analysis was applied to each group to determine the independent predictors of 5-year survival. In patients with severe disease or no disease, an ST-T abnormality was not chosen as an independent predictor of 5-year survival; in the group with mild disease, ST-T changes were an independent predictor of reduced survival. Thus, the independent impact of an ST-T abnormality on survival is dependent on the severity of underlying coronary artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "This report describes a subgroup of 17 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and an unusual and distinctive pattern of left ventricular hypertrophy characterized on echocardiography by marked thickening of the posterior left ventricular free wall and virtually normal or only modestly increased ventricular septal thickness. This distribution of hypertrophy often created a distinctive pattern of \"inverted\" asymmetry of the posterior wall relative to the septum. The thickness of the posterior wall was 20 to 42 mm (mean 25), while that of the basal ventricular septum was only 12 to 24 mm (mean 17). The left ventricular outflow tract was narrowed because of anterior displacement of the mitral valve within the small left ventricular cavity. Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve was present in 16 of the 17 patients. The patients ranged in age from 13 to 54 years (mean 31) at most recent evaluation; most (11 of 17, 65%) were severely symptomatic and had experienced important symptoms early in life (before age 40). The condition of only 4 of these 11 patients improved with medical therapy over an average follow-up period of 9 years; however, 6 of the 7 patients who had unsuccessful medical treatment and underwent operation with mitral valve replacement (5 patients) or ventricular septal myotomy-myectomy (1 patient) experienced symptomatic benefit from surgery. The subgroup of patients described in this report underscores the morphologic and clinical diversity that exists within the overall disease spectrum of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Characteristically, the patients were young, severely symptomatic and demonstrated evidence of outflow obstruction and an \"inverted\" asymmetric pattern of posterior free wall left ventricular hypertrophy.

The vasodilation associated with eating may be deleterious in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, especially during exercise. To examine the hemodynamic effects of a meal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 11 patients were studied with invasive hemodynamic monitoring during exercise testing in the fasting state and 45 min after a 740 kcal (3,100 J) meal. The meal induced a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index at rest (mean +/- SD, -17 +/- 14%), increases in mean right atrial (31 +/- 21%), mean pulmonary artery (14 +/- 14%) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge (17 +/- 14%) pressures and an increase in cardiac index (18 +/- 10%) due to an increased heart rate without any significant change in stroke volume. During postprandial exercise, heart rate, rate-pressure product, cardiac index and cardiac filling pressures were higher than during fasting exercise and one patient had a decrease in exercise blood pressure compared with the fasting test. Five patients with postprandial exacerbation of symptoms in everyday life had a lesser increase in systemic arterial pressure and stroke volume during both exercise tests and a smaller increase in cardiac index after the meal than did the six patients without postprandial symptom exacerbation, suggesting more severe cardiac disease. It is concluded that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an abnormal hemodynamic response to food, in which stroke volume fails to increase and pulmonary capillary wedge and pulmonary artery pressures increase. These adverse changes persist during postprandial exercise and may predispose to exertional collapse in certain patients.\r"

All patients had evidence of myocardial ischemia, with single-vessel disease affecting the proximal segment of one of the three major coronary arteries; no patient had had a previous myocardial infarction and all had normal cardiac function at baseline study. Cardiac index decreased during balloon inflation. Mean pulmonary artery pressure was unaffected in group 1 but increased in group 2 (from 19 +/- 5 to 31 +/- 11 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and in group 3 (from 19 +/- 2 to 22 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Right ventricular ejection fraction decreased from 62 +/- 9% to 52 +/- 10% (p less than 0.01) in group 1 and from 64 +/- 7% to 44 +/- 10% (p less than 0.005) in group 2, and returned to normal within 2 min after balloon deflation in both groups. In group 3, right ventricular ejection fraction was unchanged during balloon inflation (58 +/- 5% at baseline, 58 +/- 9% at 60 s, p = NS). Therefore, brief occlusion of the proximal segments of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery results in marked alteration of right ventricular performance that is probably caused by right ventricular free wall ischemia in the right coronary group and by the concomitant effects of septal ischemia and increased right ventricular afterload in the left anterior descending artery group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The presence of thrombus was assessed by qualitative analysis of angiograms in identical pre- and postangioplasty projections by four observers who had no knowledge of other data. Quantitation of stenosis severity before and after angioplasty and qualitative analysis of lesion eccentricity and complexity and of the presence of dissection were also performed. Although the baseline clinical characteristics of the two groups (including presenting syndromes and procedural and angiographic variables) did not differ, more patients in Group II than Group I developed new thrombus during coronary angioplasty (18% vs. 4%, p less than 0.02). In particular, patients with a presenting syndrome of recent myocardial infarction or rest angina, or both, and patients with an eccentric coronary plaque were more likely to develop new thrombus if they received nonionic than if they received ionic contrast medium (p less than 0.05). Patients with new thrombus formation and patients with thrombus present both before and after angioplasty had a high incidence of acute procedural complications (36% and 23%, respectively). Patients in Groups I and II had a similar incidence of ischemic events during follow-up.\r"

  ".W": "Although enhanced sympathetic tone is a well recognized component of the autonomic profile characteristic of congestive heart failure, the contribution of parasympathetic withdrawal to this autonomic imbalance is less well described. The technique of spectral analysis of heart rate variability provides a dynamic map of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone and was thus used to define the nature of sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions in humans with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and in a paced canine model of congestive heart failure. Humans with cardiomyopathy were found to have an augmentation of the sympathetically mediated low frequency area of the power density spectrum. Parasympathetic withdrawal was demonstrated by significant reductions in the parasympathetically mediated high frequency area (p less than 0.05) and the ratio of high to low frequency areas (p less than 0.01). Administration of atropine to normal subjects resulted in a significant reduction in the high frequency area (p less than 0.05) and the high/low frequency area ratio, both of which decreased within the range noted in patients with congestive heart failure. Administration of isoproterenol in normal subjects led to an augmentation of the low frequency area but to only a small decrease in the high/low frequency area ratio. Induction of congestive heart failure in a paced canine model resulted in alterations in the autonomic profile that resembled those seen in humans with ventricular failure. The prominent high frequency region of the spectrum at baseline, indicating a predominance of parasympathetic tone, was absent after the evolution of congestive heart failure, and there was a marked augmentation of the low frequency region of the spectrum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Using a classic immunohistochemical method or ex vivo analysis of heart slices in dogs with acute myocardial infarction subjected to intravenous injection of unlabeled antimyosin antibodies or antimyosin antibodies labeled with indium-111, it was observed that all antibody fragments specifically reached the targeted necrotic zone less than 2 h after antibody injection and remained bound for up to 24 h. In a limited but significant number of cases (5 of the 12 humans and 11 of 43 dogs), it was possible to image the necrotic zone in vivo as early as 2 to 4 h after antibody injection. In other cases, individual blood clearance variations retarded or even prevented in vivo necrosis detection. Higher antimyosin fixation values were obtained in the necrotic zones in dogs with a rapid blood clearance relative to that of the other dogs. It is concluded that antimyosin antibodies always reached necrotic areas within 2 h. If blood clearance was rapid, in vivo imaging of the necrotic area was possible 2 to 6 h after necrosis, even in humans. In some cases, however, uncontrolled individual variations in the timing required for sufficient blood clearance hampered this rapid in vivo detection of myocardial necrosis.\r"

  ".W": "Although both intravenous dipyridamole and adenosine have been used to produce coronary vasodilation during cardiac imaging, the relative potency of the commonly administered doses of these agents has not been evaluated. Accordingly, the coronary and systemic hemodynamic effects of intravenous adenosine (140 micrograms/kg per min) and intravenous dipyridamole (0.56 mg/kg over 4 min) were compared with a maximally dilating dose of intracoronary papaverine in 15 patients. Coronary blood flow responses were assessed using a Doppler catheter in a nonstenotic coronary artery. The protocol was discontinued in two patients because of transient asymptomatic atrioventricular (AV) block during adenosine infusion. The mean heart rate increased more with adenosine (11 +/- 9 beats/min) and dipyridamole (11 +/- 7 beats/min) than with papaverine (4 +/- 3 beats/min, p less than 0.05 vs. adenosine and papaverine). The mean arterial pressure decreased less with dipyridamole (-10 +/- 3 mm Hg) and papaverine (-9 +/- 4 mm Hg) than with adenosine (-16 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.01 vs. dipyridamole and papaverine). The peak/rest coronary blood flow velocity ratio was greater with papaverine (3.9 +/- 1.1) than with adenosine (3.4 +/- 1.2, p less than or equal to 0.05 vs. papaverine) or dipyridamole (3.1 +/- 1.2, p less than 0.01 vs. papaverine). A larger decrease in coronary resistance as measured by the coronary vascular resistance index occurred with papaverine (0.25 +/- 0.06) and adenosine (0.26 +/- 0.09) than with dipyridamole (0.31 +/- 0.10, p less than 0.01 vs. papaverine, p less than 0.05 vs. adenosine).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Exertional dyspnea in patients with heart failure may be due, in part, to respiratory muscle underperfusion. Near-infrared spectroscopy is a new technique that permits noninvasive assessment of skeletal muscle oxygenation by monitoring changes in near-infrared light absorption. With use of near-infrared spectroscopy, serratus anterior muscle oxygenation during maximal bicycle exercise was compared in 10 patients with heart failure (ejection fraction 16 +/- 5%) and 7 age-matched normal subjects. Oxygen consumption (VO2), minute ventilation (VE) and arterial saturation were also measured. Changes in difference in absorption between 760 and 800 nm, expressed in arbitrary units, were used to detect muscle deoxygenation. Minimal change in this difference in absorption occurred in normal subjects during exercise, whereas patients with heart failure exhibited progressive changes throughout exercise consistent with respiratory muscle deoxygenation (peak exercise: normal 3 +/- 6, heart failure 12 +/- 4 near-infrared arbitrary units, p less than 0.001). At comparable work loads patients with heart failure had significantly greater minute ventilation and respiratory rate but similar tidal volume when contrasted with normal subjects. However, at peak exercise normal subjects achieved significantly greater minute ventilation and tidal volume with a comparable respiratory rate. No significant arterial desaturation occurred during exercise in either group. These findings indicate that respiratory muscle deoxygenation occurs in patients with heart failure during exercise. This deoxygenation may contribute to the exertional dyspnea experienced by such patients.\r"

  ".U": "91310970\r", 
  ".W": "Although cardiopulmonary bypass support has been increasingly used for high risk coronary angioplasty, few data exist regarding its effects on left ventricular function. Accordingly, in 20 patients changes in left ventricular size, afterload and myocardial function were assessed by continuous hemodynamic monitoring and simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography during cardiopulmonary bypass-supported high risk angioplasty. The cross-sectional left ventricular area during bypass support remained unchanged during diastole, whereas during systole it decreased (from 29.6 +/- 11.4 to 27.6 +/- 10.4 cm2, p less than 0.05). Global left ventricular function expressed as fractional area change remained unchanged from baseline to bypass support but decreased during balloon inflation (from 0.27 +/- 0.11 to 0.17 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic meridional wall stress decreased during bypass support (from 141 +/- 75 to 110 +/- 58 x 10(3) dynes/cm2, p less than 0.02). Regional myocardial function was assessed by a wall motion score (0 = normal, 1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia and 3 = dyskinesia). Regions supplied by a stenotic (greater than or equal to 50% diameter) vessel deteriorated during bypass support (score from 0.9 +/- 0.8 to 1.06 +/- 0.8, p less than 0.01), whereas regions supplied by a nonstenotic vessel did not. Regions supplied by the target vessel deteriorated further during balloon inflation (score from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.75, p less than 0.001). Thus, although left ventricular size and global function remain unchanged and afterload decreases during bypass support, myocardial dysfunction in regions supplied by a stenotic vessel may occur. Furthermore, regional and global left ventricular dysfunction still occur with angioplasty balloon inflation during cardiopulmonary bypass support.\r"

  ".U": "91310971\r", 
  ".W": "After successful coronary angioplasty, the minimal luminal diameter of the dilated coronary artery segment is generally smaller than the diameter of the largest balloon catheter at the maximal inflation pressure. The determinants of this phenomenon were studied in 28 patients. Biplane angiograms were obtained after intracoronary administration of isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) before, immediately and 24 h after coronary angioplasty. Balloon and coronary luminal diameters were measured by automated contour detection. Immediately after the procedure, the difference between inflated balloon diameter and minimal luminal diameter averaged 0.93 +/- 0.43 mm for the entire group and was greater both in eccentric stenoses (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.70 +/- 0.36 mm; p less than 0.01) and after angioplasty with an oversized balloon (1.20 +/- 0.37 vs. 0.71 +/- 0.33 mm; p less than 0.005). At 24 h, the balloon - minimal luminal diameter difference was unchanged at the group level (0.86 +/- 0.38 mm, but the minimal luminal diameter increased significantly in the subgroup of coronary segments dilated with an oversized balloon (1.97 +/- 0.37 vs. 1.81 +/- 0.28 mm; p less than 0.05). Thus, the difference between the minimal diameter of a dilated coronary segment immediately after a successful coronary balloon angioplasty procedure and the maximal diameter of the inflated balloon catheter is dependent both on eccentricity of the stenosis and on the balloon/artery diameter ratio. Moreover, the increase in minimal luminal diameter 24 h after angioplasty performed with an oversized balloon suggest that in addition to elastic recoil partly reversible factors related to vessel barotrauma are involved.\r"
