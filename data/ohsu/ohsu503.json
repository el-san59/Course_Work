  ".W": "We analyzed the mechanism by which accessory cells support the induction of the proliferation of human peripheral blood T cells by a monoclonal anti-CD3 antibody, OKT3. Cross-linking of T cell receptor/CD3 complex by anti-CD3 coupled to latex beads and the addition of IL-1 are not enough to induce the IL-2 production and proliferation of T cells extensively depleted of accessory cells, while the addition of both the culture supernatant of macrophages or a monoblastic cell line, U937 cells, and the paraformaldehyde-fixed macrophages or U937 cells which had been precultured with interferon-gamma before fixation into the culture of the T cells with anti-CD3-latex did induce the T cell proliferation. Lack of the addition of either one of these did not induce the response. These results indicate that the signal(s) delivered by soluble factors released from the accessory cells and that delivered by the physical interaction between accessory cells and T cells are both required for the induction of IL 2 production and proliferation of T cells by anti-CD3-latex. Importantly, the macrophages or U937 cells had to be cultured with Con A-stimulated lymphocyte culture supernatant or IFN-gamma prior to fixation with paraformaldehyde, suggesting that a molecule(s) inducible on accessory cells surface by IFN-gamma or other lymphokine is necessary for the effective accessory cell-T cell interaction to induce the T cell response. It was further revealed that the activity of the culture supernatant of accessory cells may be mediated synergistically by IL 1 and a certain other factor(s) and was actually shown to be replaced by the combined addition of rIL-1 and rIL-6 but not by rIL-1 alone. The experimental system described here will be very useful for dissecting the accessory functions for T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "We have characterized maturation of B lymphocytes in the chicken Harderian gland. Expression of Ig genes was studied by using lambda L and mu H chain-specific DNA probes. In unstimulated chickens, the concentration of mu H chain and lambda L chain mRNA in the Harderian gland was observed to be greater than 8 times higher than in the bursa of Fabricius or spleen. By using in situ hybridization, the plasma cells expressing mu mRNA were located in central area of the gland packed around the tubules. Antibodies produced by the Harderian plasma cells were measured from the tears before and after antigenic stimulation. In unstimulated chickens high levels of total IgM, IgA, and IgG were observed. After ocular stimulation with tetanus toxoid, specific antitetanus IgG and IgA antibodies appeared in the tears but IgM antibodies were barely detectable. These results indicate that after antigenic stimulation the Harderian B cells rapidly mature through IgM secretion to the production of IgG or IgA. Southern blot analysis of the Harderian total genomic DNA showed strong rearrangement in the lambda L chain locus. In contrast, the band indicating major rearrangement in the mu H chain locus gave a very poor hybridization signal, indicating deletion of C mu genes in the Harderian gland DNA. As a conclusion, our present data indicate for the Harderian gland a role in terminal B cell differentiation and Ig class switch.\r"

We have earlier reported a high frequency of cells producing anti-CII autoantibodies and a low frequency of cells producing multispecific antibodies, in regional lymph nodes 9 to 11 days after primary immunization with CII. It is shown here that anti-CII antibodies produced during primary immune response are IgG-antibodies mainly of IgG2a, IgG1 and IgG2b subclasses while IgM antibodies dominate primary responses elicited by OVA and denatured CII as analyzed with a large panel of hybridomas. Anti-CII antibodies generated during the primary response recognize at least five different epitopes on the CII molecule. The specificities of these antibodies for various epitopes result from combinational association of products encoded by genes derived from various VH and VK families and/or by the occurrence of somatic mutations. It is suggested that the primary anti-CII autoantibody response involves activation of memory B cells and is in this aspect different from the origin of \"natural\" autoantibodies.\r"

  ".W": "Glomerular mesangial cells (MC) were isolated from rats and cultured for a prolonged period of time, resulting in a homogeneous cell population. MC were characterized as belonging to the smooth muscle type. They were negative for MHC class II expression. IFN-gamma and TNF alpha suppressed the proliferation of MC, demonstrating receptors for these cytokines on MC. IFN-gamma or TNF alpha, respectively, enhanced basal MHC class I Ag expression of proliferating cells in culture. The combination of the two cytokines yielded stronger effects. IL-1 beta was ineffective in enhancing MHC class I Ag expression, although MC possessed receptors for this cytokine. IFN-gamma dose dependently induced the expression of MHC class II Ag, while TNF alpha or IL-1 beta were ineffective alone. The combination of IFN-gamma with TNF alpha or IL-1 beta resulted in an enhanced induction of MHC class II Ag, compared to IFN-gamma administration alone. These findings suggest that proliferating mesangial cells of the smooth muscle type may participate in local inflammatory responses or substitute for macrophages by meeting the accessory cell requirement in the interaction with T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the data have important implications for the evaluation of the role of mesangial cells in autoimmune disease of the kidney.\r"

  ".U": "89156456\r", 
  ".W": "The Ly-6 alloantigens represent a family of phosphatidylinositol anchored proteins that function in the process of T lymphocyte activation and whose expression are often induced on T and B lymphocytes after activation by mitogens or Ag. Previous studies have shown that the induction of Ly-6 alloantigens in T cells is at least in part due to the action of IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-gamma. In the present report, we have demonstrated that IFN-gamma also induced Ly-6 molecules on B lymphocytes, several B cell tumors, and bone marrow cells. Furthermore, we now show that TNF also participates in the induction of at least one of the Ly-6 proteins, Ly-6A/E. TNF was found to synergize with IFN-gamma to induce Ly-6A/E expression in thymocytes, T lymphocytes, bone marrow cells, but not B lymphocytes. For T lymphocytes, the synergistic induction of Ly-6A/E by TNF was restricted to cells from the Ly-6.1 haplotype, whereas IFN-gamma was sufficient to fully induce Ly-6A/E expression in cells from the Ly-6.2 haplotype. This result is consistent with the notion that there is more complex regulation of the Ly-6A/E molecules in T cells obtained from the Ly-6.1 haplotype. For T lymphocytes from BALB/c (Ly-6.1) mice, Ly-6A/E, but not Ly-6C, molecules were synergistically induced by IFN-gamma and TNF. The induction of Ly-6A/E molecules on BALB/c T cells resulted in an enhanced capacity to activate these cells through the Ly-6 T cell activation pathway. One transformed T cell line, 5.1.2, was also identified whose Ly-6A/E molecules were synergistically induced by IFN-gamma and TNF. Optimal expression of Ly-6A/E molecules on 5.1.2 cells required continuous culture of this cell line with these two cytokines and resulted in the detection of optimal levels of cytoplasmic Ly-6A/E mRNA by Northern blot analysis. This latter result suggests that IFN-gamma and TNF regulate Ly-6A/E at the level of transcription and/or mRNA stabilization.\r"

  ".U": "89156458\r", 
  ".W": "It is known that many immunologic responses to IL-1 are antagonized by the neuropeptide alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH). This led us to investigate the possible reciprocal effects of IL-1 and the functionally related epidermal cytokines, epidermal cell-derived thymocyte activating factor (ETAF) and IL-6, on the melanogenic effect of alpha-MSH on murine Cloudman melanoma cells. When these cells were treated with ETAF in combination with alpha-MSH or its potent analog [Nle4,D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH, the melanotropin induced increase in tyrosinase activity, and thus melanin synthesis, was abrogated. This inhibitory effect of ETAF was not mediated by competitive binding to the melanotropin receptor, because ETAF also blocked the melanogenic response of melanoma cells to isobutyl methylxanthine (IBMX) and to PGE1 and PGE2. ETAF had no effect on cellular proliferation. Inhibition of the stimulated tyrosinase activity by ETAF was not due to diminished cAMP synthesis or increased cAMP degradation. Cells treated concomitantly with ETAF and alpha-MSH, IBMX, or PGE1 had the same cAMP levels as cells treated with alpha-MSH, IBMX, or PGE1 alone. In contrast to ETAF, human rIL-1 alpha or IL-1 beta alone or in combination did not have an inhibitory effect on melanogenesis. IL-6 significantly inhibited the basal level of tyrosinase and partially abrogated the alpha-MSH-induced tyrosinase activity. IL-6 also stimulated cellular proliferation when added alone or in combination with alpha-MSH. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not alter either the tyrosinase activity or cellular replication at the concentrations tested. IL-1 alpha, GM-CSF, and IL-6 or IL-1 alpha and GM-CSF added together did not significantly affect the MSH-induced tyrosinase activity. These results ascribe a new potential function for ETAF and IL-6 as modulators of the melanogenic response of pigment cells.\r"

  ".W": "The present studies were initiated to characterize a 150-kDa molecule with inhibitory activity for C3bBb formation, which is present in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Therefore, human endothelial culture supernatants (HECS) were analyzed for the presence of human complement factor H by ELISA. It was found that H was present in HECS. An immunoblot analysis of affinity purified H from HECS showed that the size of HUVEC H was identical to that of plasma H. The mean production of H by HUVEC of first passage cultures was 40 ng/10(6) cells/day. The synthesis of HUVEC H was fully inhibitable by the addition of cycloheximide to the cultures, suggesting that H is de novo synthesized. Additional evidence for de novo synthesis was obtained by using biosynthetic labeling with [35S] methionine, immunoprecipitation, and SDS-PAGE. It was demonstrated that, indeed, HUVEC produce and secrete factor H. Two forms of the protein were identified, the 150-kDa form and also a 45-kDa form, both forms have been identified in plasma. The functional activity of HUVEC H is identical to that of plasma H. IFN-gamma induced enhanced synthesis of H by HUVEC, whereas it had no effect on C3 synthesis. Supernatant from stimulated PBMC, T cell growth factor, enhanced synthesis of both H and C3. The present studies indicate that H is produced by HU-VEC and that H may function as an inhibitor of complement activation at the endothelial cell level and, thereby, together with molecules like decay accelerating factor and membrane cofactor protein, may influence resistance of endothelial cells to complement mediated damage.\r"

  ".W": "Soluble egg Ag (SEA) were separated according to charge by agarose-IEF (A-IEF) in order to partially characterize those antigenic determinants that may elicit the granulomatous response in schistosomiasis mansoni. Coomassie blue-stained A-IEF gels of SEA showed that this technique was able to resolve multiple isobands. A-IEF gels were sliced into 18 or 36 fractions from anode to cathode, and the SEA components from the isoelectric point (pI) fractions were eluted from gels in a manner that allowed for their direct utilization in both cellular and in humoral immunoassays. Only Ag in two distinct pI ranges consistently elicited lymphoproliferative responses, with the major stimulatory fractions being in the acid (3.5 to 5.0) range. Lymphocytes from mice infected for 10 wk had higher proliferative responses to both SEA and fractionated Ag in this acid pI range when compared to lymphocytes from mice infected for 25 wk; however, the latter had an enhanced response to Ag with a pI range of 6.2 to 6.4. In contrast to the cellular responses, the corresponding sera from these mice, or from schistosome-infected patients, recognized Ag in all pI fractions as determined by ELISA. However, although protective and nonprotective mAb (which recognize an egg Ag that cross-reacts with a 38-kDa schistosomular Ag) bound to most acidic fractions, only the nonprotective mAb (which also recognize determinants on keyhole limpet hemocyanin), bound, in addition, to fractions in the basic range. Finally, the m.w. of Ag in the various pI fractions were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis.\r"

  ".W": "Mice with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infections are unable to mount primary responses to T-dependent Ag, such as SRBC. Responses to SRBC were restored in vitro and in vivo with rIL-1. The cellular basis of the immunodeficiency and the mechanism of IL-1 action were investigated. B cells from infected mice were capable of normal levels of PFC production when provided with the appropriate signals, IL-2 plus IL-1. T cells from infected mice were unable to provide Th function to normal B cells. However, Th activity was provided by these cells if IL-1 was added to the cultures. Furthermore, T-depleted spleen cells from infected mice did not make antibody in the presence of normal T cells unless IL-1 was added to the cultures. Neutralizing antibody against IL-2 greatly reduced the augmentation by IL-1 of the antibody response of cells from infected mice. Together these results indicate that splenic B cells from infected mice are capable of antibody production, but that Th function is lacking in the spleens of infected mice. These results suggest that the inability of mice with T. cruzi infection to mount primary antibody responses to T-dependent Ag may be due to a macrophage defect lending to impairment of Th function. These results document the potential of IL-1 in restoring immune competence in an infectious disease model.\r"

The cDNA insert of clone lambda C2HL5-3 was sequenced in its entirety. It consisted of 2961 nucleotides including a 5' untranslated region of 388 nucleotides, followed by a 60 nucleotide region coding for a putative signal peptide, a 2196 nucleotide region coding for the 732 amino acids of the mature C2 polypeptide, and a 317 nucleotide long 3' untranslated region. Comparison of the nucleotide sequence to the previously reported C2 cDNA sequence showed two major differences. First, the 5' untranslated region of C2HL5-3 was 352 nucleotides longer and included four ATG followed by in-frame termination codons. Second, nucleotide residue 1987 was a C instead of a G, resulting in a change of amino acid residue 513 from Leu to Phe and in the appearance of an EcoRI site. The full-length C2 cDNA was cloned into the expression vector p91023(B). Transfection of the recombinant plasmid in COS cells resulted in the secretion of a protein with antigenicity and hemolytic activity similar to those of native C2. Western blot analysis indicated that secreted rC2 had the same apparent m.w. as C2 in human serum. Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from transfected COS cells showed two bands of C2 mRNA, both of which were longer than human liver C2 mRNA and represent transcripts generated by the vector-C2 construct.\r"

The library was screened with a chicken class II probe (beta 2 exon specific) and three MHC class II beta chain genomic clones were isolated. The restriction maps of the three clones showed that each of the three clones was unique. The position of the beta chain sequence was located in each of the three genomic clones by Southern blot hybridization. Subclones containing the beta chain gene were produced from each of the genomic clones and the orientation of the leader peptide, beta 1, beta 2, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic exons was determined by Southern blot hybridization and nucleotide sequencing. The complete nucleotide sequence of two of the three subclones was determined. Comparison of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the two subclones with other class II beta chain sequences showed that the B6 chicken beta chain genes are evolutionarily related to the class II beta chain genes from chickens of other MHC haplotypes, and to class II beta chain genes from other species. Analysis of Southern blots of B6 chicken DNA, as well as the isolation of the three beta chain genes, suggests that chickens of the B6 haplotype possess at least three MHC class II beta chain genes.\r"

It is assumed that LAK cells lyse their targets solely by direct cell to cell contact, possibly involving the degranulation and exocytosis of pore-forming elements, similar to that observed with cytotoxic T lymphocytes and NK cells. Reported here are studies demonstrating that LAK cells release factor(s) that are cytotoxic for a human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, when stimulated with tumor cells. The factor(s) are slow acting and maximum cytotoxicity is observed only in a 72-h cytotoxic assay. The ability of LAK cells to secrete cytotoxic factor(s) is dependent on both the ratio of LAK cells to stimulating tumor cells as well as the length of their coincubation. A number of similarly slow acting cytokines that are cytostatic and/or cytotoxic for tumor cells have been described. We tested the ability of specific polyclonal antibodies directed against TNF, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IFN-gamma to neutralize the cytotoxic supernatant activity. Only antibodies specific for IFN-gamma and TNF were neutralizing. We measured the amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF in the cytotoxic supernatants and determined that increased amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF were released after LAK cell-tumor cell interactions compared to supernatants of LAK cells alone or tumor cell alone. Comparable concentrations of human rIFN-gamma and rTNF resulted in similar levels (50 to 90%) of MCF-7 cell cytotoxicity as those observed with the stimulated LAK cell supernatants. We thus concluded that the majority of the cytotoxic activity released by LAK cells when stimulated with tumor cells was attributed to the synergistic activities of IFN-gamma and TNF. The significance of these observations in relation to the possible mechanisms by which LAK cells mediate cytolysis is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "To test the hypothesis that susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytolysis varies inversely with the levels of target cell class I HLA expression, NK-susceptible K562 and MOLT-4 target cells have been transfected via electroporation with cloned human class I HLA-A2 and HLA-B7 genes. Stably transfected cells expressing varying levels of cell-surface class I HLA have been selected by fluorescent activated cell sorting and tested for susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis by freshly isolated peripheral blood NK cells from nine normal volunteers as well as by cloned human NK effectors and tumor cells from a patient with an NK cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Expression of class I HLA did not alter the susceptibility of K562 or MOLT-4 target cells to NK-mediated cytolysis by any of the effectors tested. In addition, the class I HLA-expressing transfectant cells were identical to mock transfected cells in their ability to compete for lysis in cold target inhibition assays. Treatment of both mock-transfected and class I HLA-transfected K562 cells with IFN-gamma resulted in decreased susceptibility to NK-mediated cytolysis which was independent of the total level of class I HLA expression. These results demonstrate that the level of target cell class I HLA expression is not sufficient to determine susceptibility or resistance to NK-mediated cytolysis of the classical NK targets K562 and MOLT-4.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the anti-tumor mechanism against a syngeneic tumor using a BALB/c-MA tumor system by cytolysis and cytostasis assays in vitro comparing mice neonatally thymectomized at 1 day or 7 days after birth (NTx-1, NTx-7), sham-operated (sham) mice, and congenitally athymic nude BALB/c mice. NTx-1 mice showed more rapid tumor growth and a slightly lower degree of strong cytostatic activity in peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) than NTx-7 or sham mice. Nude mice showed more rapid MA growth than NTx-1 mice and no cytostatic activity in PEC. After immunization with mitomycin C-treated MA (MMC-MA), NTx-1 mice acquired an immunoprophylactic capacity against MA and showed cytostatic activity and delayed footpad reaction (DFR) to MA, however, nude mice showed no acquisition of such an immunity, or cytostatic activity, or DFR to MA. These differences between NTx-1 and nude mice could be well-explained by less capacity of nude mice to produce a macrophage-activating factor, which activates macrophages to exert cytostasis and DFR. However, NTx-1 mice could not reject MA by immunization with MMC-MA in CFA (MMC-MA/CFA), although such immunized sham mice could eliminate MA completely. Both PEC and spleen cells from Sham mice immunized with MMC-MA/CFA showed cytostatic activity, whereas NTx-1 mice showed cytostatic activity of the same level in PEC and less in spleen cells compared to Sham mice. Cytolytic activity was never detected throughout this study in a BALB/c-MA system. These data suggest that cytostasis plays an important role in antitumor immunity against a syngeneic MA tumor and that two types of cytostasis is included from the standpoint of thymus-dependency of ontogenic development, relatively low and high.\r"

Mean body weight increment (1.6 kg) correlated with the increase in plasma ANP (r = 0.59; P less than 0.01). The plasma concentrations of antidiuretic hormone, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity decreased. All these hormonal effects, reflecting retention of sodium and fluid volume, were probably due to the known mineralocorticoid properties of licorice. Blood pressure increased transiently and two subjects developed reversible hypertension. The rise in plasma ANP concentration during ingestion of licorice may be considered a physiological response to prevent fluid retention and development of hypertension.\r"

  ".W": "White mice, 18-20 g, were fed purified diets containing two weight percent safflower oil plus ten weight percent menhaden, corn, or olive oil for 2 wk. Menhaden oil ingestion resulted in significantly higher levels of 22:6(n-3) and 20:5(n-3), particularly 22:6(n-3), and lower levels of 20:4(n-6) and 18:2(n-6) in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) phospholipids than did corn or olive oil ingestion. These changes in fatty acid composition resulted in a significant decrease in the value of the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio of cardiac SR phospholipids. The ratio was 2.8 versus 0.2 in choline phospholipids and 1.9 versus 0.2 in ethanolamine phospholipids in SR of mice fed corn or menhaden oil, respectively. This reduction in the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio was associated with a lower relative activity of Ca2+-Mg2+ ATPase, and a lower initial rate of calcium transport and maximum calcium uptake in SR vesicles from mice fed menhaden oil rather than olive or corn oils. The specific activity of NADPH cytochrome C reductase (EC 1.6.2.3) of cardiac SR was not affected by dietary lipids. These data indicate that modification of SR by 22:6(n-3) may change the SR bilayer structure resulting in alteration of the calcium transport properties of SR vesicles. In addition, our results suggest that reduction of calcium flux across cardiac SR following fish oil consumption may also reduce the susceptibility of myocytes to rapid changes in calcium concentrations which may occur during ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

In OD rats, the dietary requirement of ascorbic acid to maintain normal growth and normal levels of cholesterol in serum and liver is about 300 mg of ascorbic acid/kg diet. In OD rats fed the basal diet, acute or chronic ascorbic acid deficiency did not affect the activity of hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and fecal excretion of bile acids. However, in OD rats fed diets containing either cholesterol or PCB, acute ascorbic acid deficiency caused a higher level of serum cholesterol, a lower activity of hepatic cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and a lower excretion of fecal bile acids than in OD rats fed a basal diet containing an adequate level of ascrobic acid. It is concluded that acute ascorbic acid deficiency causes a hypercholesterolemia due to the depression of bile acid synthesis in OD rats fed a purified diet with cholesterol or PCB.\r"

A liquid test meal consisting of [14C]lectin and an unabsorbable marker, [3H]polyethylene glycol (PEG), was administered to rats in order to investigate behavior of the lectin in the gastrointestinal tract. At 1 h after administration, 54% of the administered [14C]lectin was still in the stomach, 1% had reached the cecum, and 1-6% was found in the intestinal mucosa, indicating that the lectin was binding to the mucosa. In another experiment, rats were fed a commercial nonpurified diet for 3 d after administration of the test meal. About 87% of the administered lectin as well as 83% of [3H]PEG was recovered from the feces during these 3d. Lectin bound to the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa was recovered by liberating it from the cells with D-galactose. The recovered lectin showed both hemagglutinating activity and the antigenicity identical with those of the original lectin. These results clearly indicated that the lectin remained intact in the gastrointestinal tract while a part of it was bound to the intestinal mucosa, the rest being excreted directly into feces.\r"

Nitrous oxide was delivered in all cases via nasal mask in a 30% to 50% concentration. The mean total dose of Brevital in group 1 (intermittent Brevital bolus) was 0.17 mg/kg/min (SD = 0.07), group 2 (Brevital infusion) was 0.23 mg/kg/min (SD = 0.06), and group 3 (alfentanil/Brevital infusion) was 0.12 mg/kg/min (SD = 0.07). Mean total dose of alfentanil in group 3 equaled 1.58 mcg/kg/min (SD = 0.73). In group 1, 94% of the patients experienced moderate to severe movement intraoperatively. Twenty-three percent of the patients in group 2, and only 7% of group 3 exhibited moderate to severe movement. Emergence in group 3 averaged 4.5 minutes (SD = 1.6). Three patients (7%) in group 3 had postoperative nausea. Additional subjective findings in group 3 included easier airway maintenance during administration of the anesthetic, lack of unpleasant emergence phenomena such as crying, and prompt readiness for discharge. It was concluded that continuous alfentanil and Brevital infusion satisfied the objectives of safety, stability, predictability, and rapid recovery, while improving operating conditions (less patient movement) when compared with more traditional anesthetic techniques.\r"

Infants with BPD had significantly lower energy intake but higher energy expenditure than did control infants. Weight gain and energy cost of growth were significantly less in BPD infants than in control infants, as were urine output and output/intake ratio. We conclude that infants with BPD (1) absorbed caloric intake as well as did normal control infants, (2) had low energy intake and high energy expenditure, resulting in poor weight gain, and (3) had low energy cost of growth, suggesting an alteration in composition of tissue gain, with relatively high water content.\r"

Both type I and type II IFNs enhanced the expression of TAG-72 and CEA and altered the level of expression of the MHC antigens. Comparative studies of three different Hu-IFNs (IFN-alpha A, IFN-beta ser, and IFN-gamma) revealed that IFN-gamma was the most potent in augmenting either B72.3 or COL-4 binding. Unlike the IFN-gamma -mediated induction of the class II human leukocyte antigens, the change in tumor antigen expression consisted of enhanced constitutive antigen expression; de novo induction of either TAG-72 or CEA could not be achieved by either type I or type II IFN. Of 43 effusions isolated from different adenocarcinoma patients, 42 (97.7%) expressed either CEA or TAG-72, and treatment with Hu-IFN increased the level of expression of either antigen in 36 of 42 samples (85.7%). These studies demonstrate the augmentation of tumor-associated antigens on human carcinoma cells isolated from serous effusions by Hu-IFNs which may be used to enhance the targeting of conjugated MAbs to human carcinoma lesions.\r"

We analyzed all peripheral vascular surgical admissions (n = 1240) by age treated at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center from 1985 to 1987. Hospital cost and length of stay per patient increased with age, as did losses under diagnostic related group (DRG) prospective hospital payment. Hospital cost by hospital service showed considerable variation by age category; outliers, mortality, and the number of diagnoses and procedures generally rose with age. Use of hospital resources, such as emergency or surgical intensive care unit admission, or the need for blood or plasma products was high in general for patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. This study demonstrates a number of findings regarding the socioeconomic factors for hospitalized patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. Surgical health policy analysis of this specialty vis-a-vis current changes proposed to the federal medicare DRG system in the U.S. Congress and Health Care Financing Administration suggests a relatively greater impact on the specialty of peripheral vascular surgery demonstrated in this study by the use of higher resources of the same.\r"

There have been 366 deaths, including 22 from treatment-related conditions. A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors demonstrated that stage of disease, nodal and resection margin involvement, and the presence of residual disease are significant determinants of survival. Weight loss before surgery had a significant independent influence on survival. The combination of preoperative symptoms and intraoperative findings may be used to select patients for radical or palliative procedures.\r"

As a result, large amounts of cholestanol, the 5 alpha-dihydro derivative of cholesterol, accumulate in virtually every tissue, with extra large deposits in the nervous system, xanthomas, and bile. Clinically, progressive neurologic dysfunction, tendon xanthomas, cataracts, and atherosclerosis are commonly found. Because chenodeoxycholic acid, a primary bile acid, is almost devoid from the bile, replacement therapy (750 mg per day) suppresses abnormal bile acid synthesis, reduces elevated cholestanol synthesis and plasma concentrations, and improves neurologic function in this disease.\r"

  ".W": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by a defective gene found on the X-chromosome. Dystrophin is encoded by the DMD gene and represents about 0.002% of total muscle protein. Immunochemical studies have shown that dystrophin is localized to the sarcolemma in normal muscle but is absent in muscle from DMD patients. Many features of the predicted primary structure of dystrophin are shared with membrane cytoskeletal proteins, but the precise function of dystrophin in muscle is unknown. Here we report the first isolation of dystrophin from digitonin-solubilized skeletal muscle membranes using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose. We find that dystrophin is not a glycoprotein but binds to WGA-Sepharose because of its tight association with a WGA-binding glycoprotein. The association of dystrophin with this glycoprotein is disrupted by agents that dissociate cytoskeletal proteins from membranes. We conclude that dystrophin is linked to an integral membrane glycoprotein in the sarcolemma. Our results indicate that the function of dystrophin could be to link this glycoprotein to the underlying cytoskeleton and thus help either to preserve membrane stability or to keep the glycoprotein non-uniformly distributed in the sarcolemma.\r"

  ".W": "The function of the frizzled (fz) locus in Drosophilia melanogaster is required to coordinate the cytoskeletons of epidermal cells to produce a parallel array of cuticular hairs and bristles (for example on the wild-type wing all hairs point towards the distal tip). In fz mutants it is not the structure of individual hairs and bristles that is altered, but their orientation with respect to their neighbours and the organism as a whole. Mitotic clone analysis indicates that fz has two functions in the developing wing. It is required for the proximal-distal transmission of an intercellular polarity signal, a process that is expected to be at least partly extracellular. It is also required for cells to respond to the polarity signal, which is expected to be a cytoplasmic function. The fz locus could encode either one bifunctional or two single-function proteins. We report here that, in pupae, fz produces a messenger RNA that encodes a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains. Thus, the Fz protein should contain both extracellular and cytoplasmic domains, which could function in the transmission and interpretation of polarity information, respectively. This is the first reported sequence for the protein product of a tissue polarity gene.\r"

  ".W": "Cyclins, originally discovered in the eggs of marine invertebrates, are proteins which undergo dramatic cycles of synthesis followed by degradation at the metaphase-anaphase transition of cell division. That they participate in the G2-M transition is supported by the fact that when synthetic cyclin messenger RNAs from clam and sea urchin are microinjected into the G2-arrested oocytes of Xenopus, they induce maturation. The cyclin of fission yeast is the product of the cdc13 gene, which is known to interact with cdc2, a gene required for the entry into mitosis. We have cloned the genes that encode A-type and B-type cyclins from Drosophila melanogaster by virtue of their sequence similarity to oligonucleotides corresponding to conserved regions of the cyclin genes. We show that both genes encode abundant maternal mRNAs, but whereas the cyclin A mRNA is relatively uniformly distributed before cell formation, the cyclin B mRNA becomes localized to the developing pole cells. In larvae, cyclin A is expressed predominantly in brain and imaginal disks, whereas cyclin B transcripts are abundant in testes.\r"

This isotype exclusion is effected at the level of the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin gene segments, although by an unknown mechanism. An attractive possibility is that, following productive rearrangement of one of the light-chain loci, the newly synthesized light-chain polypeptide inhibits DNA rearrangement for the other isotype. To test such feedback regulation, we have created transgenic mice carrying a rearranged lambda 1-gene. By contrast with the B cells in normal newborn mice which are mainly kappa+lambda-, the B cells in the newborn transgenic mice express lambda- but not kappa-chains. We propose that the synthesis of any light chain, be it kappa or lambda, that allows expression of IgM on the cell surface results in a cessation of all V-J joining. Interestingly, the limited light-chain repertoire of the transgenic mice does not persist and most adult B cells express endogenous kappa-rearrangements and down-regulate the transgene.\r"

The enzyme consists of two polypeptide heavy chains of relative molecular mass (Mr) approximately 110,000-140,000 (110K-140K) plus copurifying light chains; these polypeptides are arranged in a structure consisting of two globular heads attached to a fibrous stalk which terminates in a 'feathered' tail. Here we report that a function-disrupting monoclonal antikinesin, which binds to the 45K fragment of the kinesin heavy chain, recognizes an epitope located towards the N-terminal end of the heavy chain, and decorates the two globular heads lying at one end of the intact molecules (one antibody per head). The results show that the two heavy chains of native kinesin are arranged in parallel, and that the 45K fragments, which display nucleotide-sensitive interactions with microtubules, represent mechanochemical 'heads' located at the N-terminal regions of the heavy chains. Thus, it is likely that the kinesin heads are analogous to the subfragment-1 domains of myosin.\r"

This, together with the fact that the bacterial enzyme can mimic the action of mammalian PLC in causing, for example, enhanced prostaglandin biosynthesis, suggests that B. cereus PLC can be used as a model for the hitherto poorly characterized mammalian PLCs. We report here the three-dimensional structure of B. cereus PLC at 1.5 A resolution. The enzyme is an all-helix protein belonging to a novel structural class and contains, at least in the crystalline state, three Zn2+ in the active site. We also present preliminary results from a study at 1.9 A resolution of the complex between PLC and inorganic phosphate (Pi) which indicate that the substrate binds directly to the metal ions.\r"

Ninety-one of these patients have followup of more than 3 months (average, 4.67 years). The most common indication for the procedure was Meniere's disease (71%). Chronic labyrinthitis, usually following stapes, middle ear, or mastoid surgery, was the next most common indication. Patients with the preoperative diagnosis of Meniere's disease had better results in the curing of vertigo (89%) than those having chronic labyrinthitis (68%). Overall, vertigo was cured in 84% of patients and markedly improved in another 15.1%. Tinnitus was relieved or improved in 65% of all patients and in 67% of patients with Meniere's disease. Mild unsteadiness was commonly noticed postoperatively, but only 11% described this as severe. Eighty percent of these latter patients reported unsteadiness preoperatively. Complications were uncommon and temporary: one case of delayed facial paresis that recovered completely, one CSF leak, and one wound infection. There were no cases of permanent facial paralysis or meningitis. The advantages of the transmeatal approach to the IAC for CVN over labyrinthectomy without CVN are assurance of complete labyrinthine denervation, increased likelihood of improved tinnitus, practice at sectioning the posterior ampullary nerve (PAN), and the ability to inspect the internal auditory canal for a small tumor or other pathology. We recommend this procedure for treatment of unilateral vestibular dysfunction in patients with no serviceable hearing.\r"

There remains a fourth group of cases that have gradual sloping high-tone threshold losses for which a pathological correlate has not been identified. We performed a quantitative histologic study, using light microscopy on the temporal bones of such cases, and again could find no pathologic explanation. We believe that the findings of this study support the concept of an alteration in cochlear motion mechanics as the most probable cause for the gradually sloping high-tone hearing loss.\r"

This study looks at the long-term audiological followup (5 to 15 years) of 46 patients who underwent a MFVNS for intractable Meniere's disease. Although the percentage of patients with stabilized hearing was relatively high within the first 2 years postoperatively (61%), it dropped to 41% after a longer followup of 5 to 15 years. When this patient population is divided into two groups based on their preoperative PTA, those patients in whom hearing had bottomed out to greater than or equal to 50 dB PTA preoperatively lost only 5 dB PTA over the course of the follow-up period. The patients with better preoperative hearing (less than 50 dB PTA) lost 30 dB PTA over the same follow-up period. As this pattern is similar to what has been observed in nonsurgically treated Meniere's patients, we conclude that the MFVNS has no beneficial effect on the hearing loss associated with Meniere's disease.\r"

The study results indicate that only a small portion of pharyngeal-generated pressure is directly applied to the bolus. The manofluorogram demonstrates that bolus transit relies on the synergistic action of two pumps--the oropharyngeal propulsion pump and the hypopharyngeal suction pump. A technique is illustrated for quantifying the forces that affect bolus flow. Quantification of force can differentiate abnormal forces responsible for lingual, pharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal pathology in dysphagic patients. The degrees of impairment can be measured.\r"

  ".W": "Meniere's disease has an episodic course, and certain patients undergo spontaneous remission of their vertigo. A retrospective study of patients treated from 1974 to 1983 was undertaken to evaluate the long-term outcome of patients with Meniere's disease for whom surgery was recommended, comparing those who had a surgical procedure with a similar group of patients who declined surgery. The surgical procedures performed were endolymphatic subarachnoid shunt (ELS), retrolabyrinthine vestibular neurectomy (RVN), middle fossa vestibular neurectomy (MFVN), and transmeatal cochleo-vestibular neurectomy (CVN). We used a questionnaire, made up according to the 1985 American Academy of Otolaryngology (AAO) criteria, for reporting results for Meniere's disease treatment, and compared patients who were offered surgery but declined (N = 50) with those who underwent surgery (N = 83). The data were analyzed statistically. Initial evaluation, which included air and bone conduction audiometry, speech discrimination, electronystagmography (ENG), frequency of vertigo attacks per month, and disability, showed both groups to be comparable at the outset. Of the non-operated group 57% had complete control of vertigo at 2 years; 71% had complete control after an average of 8.3 years. After an ELS, 40% of patients had complete control of vertigo after 2 years; 70% had complete control after an average of 8.7 years. After a neurectomy (RVN or CVN), 93% had complete control of vertigo (average followup, 4.4 years). These results indicate statistically that the ELS procedure does not alter the long-term natural course of vertigo control in Meniere's disease, whereas both the RVN and CVN significantly improve the patient's chance of being permanently free of vertigo attacks.\r"

(1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82, 1074-1078]. This method has allowed the preparation of two mutant B1 subunits in which two of the four thiols postulated to be within the active site of the enzyme, Cys-225 and Cys-759, have been changed to serines. Incubation of the [Ser225]B1 mutant with the B2 subunit, [U-14C]CDP, and the allosteric effector ATP results in production of cytosine, destruction of the tyrosyl radical in B2, radiolabeling of the protein, and cleavage of the B1 subunit into two pieces of 26 and 61.5 kDa. This process is independent of the identity of reductant. The [Ser759]B1 mutant reduces CDP in the presence of thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase at 7.7% the rate of wild-type B1. When dithiothreitol is utilized as reductant, however, the rate of CDP reduction with [Ser759]B1 is identical to that observed with wild type.\r"

The amino acid sequence encoded by jun-D has two extensive regions of homology with the other Jun proteins. One homology region includes the DNA-binding domain and sequences required for dimer formation and interaction with the Fos oncoprotein; the other includes the acidic sequence thought to be involved in gene activation. All three jun mRNAs are present in a variety of murine tissues and cell lines. In resting 3T3 cells, jun-D is expressed at a higher level compared to c-jun and jun-B, and its transcription is stimulated only slightly by serum growth factors. Thus, jun-D appears to be regulated differently than c-jun and jun-B.\r"

Raman vibrational spectra are obtained by focusing the probe laser on intact photoreceptors frozen on a 77 K cold stage. To elucidate the mechanism of wavelength regulation in blue visual pigments, we have used this apparatus to study the structure of the chromophore in the 440-nm absorbing pigment found in \"green rods\" of the toad (Bufo marinus). The 9-cis isorhodopsin form of the green rod pigment exhibits a 1662-cm-1 C = NH+ Schiff base stretching mode that shifts to 1636 cm-1 in deuterium-substituted H2O. This demonstrates that the Schiff base linkage to the protein is protonated. Protonation of the Schiff base is sufficient to explain the 440-nm absorption maximum of this pigment without invoking any additional protein-chromophore interactions. The absence of additional perturbations is supported by the observation that the ethylenic band and the perturbation-sensitive C-10-C-11 and C-14-C-15 stretching modes have the same frequency as those of the 9-cis protonated retinal Schiff base in solution. Our demonstration that a blue visual pigment contains an unperturbed protonated Schiff base provides experimental evidence that the protein charge perturbation responsible for the opsin shift in the 500-nm absorbing pigments is removed in the opsins of blue pigments, as suggested by the sequence data.\r"

These \"double-negative\" thymocytes are heterogeneous and can be divided into discrete subpopulations based on their expression of other surface markers. We have determined the relative maturity of these subpopulations based on the extent of rearrangement and expression of their T-cell receptor genes, their cell cycle status, and their thymus reconstitution capacity. Within the subpopulation of double negatives expressing high levels of the heat-stable antigen, the additional markers phagocytic glycoprotein 1 (Pgp-1) and interleukin 2 receptor (IL-2R) can be used to define the sequence IL-2R- Pgp-1+----IL-2R+ Pgp-1-----IL-2R- Pgp-1-, which occurs before the expression of CD4 and CD8. Transient expression of the IL-2R marks an important developmental point in the sequence just prior to a burst of cell proliferation and a loss of thymus reconstitution ability. The earliest cells in this sequence are already partially rearranged for genes in the C beta 1 region. IL-2R expression marks a second wave of T-cell antigen receptor of beta-chain gene rearrangement and the initiation of T-cell antigen receptor alpha- and beta-chain gene expression.\r"

We now show that the temporal sequence of the induced synthesis of PG synthase can be separated into an early transcriptional (i.e., actinomycin D inhibitable) phase and a subsequent translational (cycloheximide but not actinomycin D inhibitable) phase and that IL-1 exerts its effect during the transcriptional phase. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also stimulates synthesis of PG synthase and, together with IL-1, produces a synergistic stimulatory effect. Inhibitors of protein kinase C activation abolished the stimulatory effect of IL-1, suggesting that protein kinase C activation is a critical event in the signal-transduction sequence of the IL-1-induced increase of PG synthase synthesis. The antiinflammatory glucocorticosteroids dexamethasone and triamcinolone, but not progesterone or testosterone, were potent inhibitors of PG synthase synthesis (complete inhibition at 20 nM; IC50, 1 nM) when added during the translational phase of the synthesis sequence. The glucocorticosteroid effect was blocked by RNA and protein synthesis inhibitors. This report suggests that glucocorticosteroids exert their effect via a newly synthesized protein, causing a profound translational control of PG synthase synthesis. This novel mechanism of suppression of arachidonate metabolism is distinct from any influence of steroids on phospholipase A2 activity.\r"

Previously we found that histamine and intracellular stimulation of L32 cells, which are putatively histaminergic neurons, cause the production of 12-hydroxy-5,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE), a product of the 12-lipoxygenase pathway formed through 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-icosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE). 12-HPETE, but not 12(S)-HETE, mimics the dual-action response of L14 ink motor neurons to histamine and stimulation of L32. 12-HPETE can also be further metabolized to 8-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-5,9,14-icosatrienoic acid (8-HEpETE) which was identified by HPLC, enzymatic hydrolysis, and GC/MS. Production of 8-HEpETE is specific, as its positional isomer 10-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-5,8,14-icosatrienoic acid is not formed after physiologic stimulation. 8-HEpETE can elicit the late component (hyperpolarization) of the dual-action response in L14 cells, suggesting that it may be a second messenger in Aplysia.\r"

Barium ion was the current carrier, and the channel type studied had a high threshold of activation and fast deactivation (type FD). Block of these channels by 20 microM external Cd2+ is voltage dependent. Cd2+ ions can be cleared from blocked channels by stepping the membrane voltage (Vm) to a negative value. Clearing the channels is progressively faster and more complete as Vm is made more negative. Once cleared of Cd2+, the channels conduct transiently on reopening but reequilibrate with Cd2+ and become blocked within a few milliseconds. Cd2+ equilibrates much more slowly with closed channels, but at a holding potential of -80 mV virtually all channels are blocked at equilibrium. Cd2+ does not slow closing of the channels, as would be expected if it were necessary for Cd2+ to leave the channels before closing occurred. Instead, the data show unambiguously that the channel gate can close when the channel is Cd2+ occupied.\r"

  ".W": "Health surveys are an important source of population-based data in much of the developing world. Unfortunately, sample surveys often take more time to plan, process, and analyze than is practical, given the information needs of the local decision-makers. Rapid survey methodology (RSM) has been developed to permit health professionals to answer quickly questions about the health status and activities of people at the community level. These answers may be necessary for determining program priorities or for monitoring program activities. Rapid surveys are meant to supplement, rather than replace, information derived from existing sources of vital and health statistics data. RSM combines sample survey methods with contemporary software used in portable, battery-powered microcomputers. The ability to do rapid surveys in developing countries also requires knowledge of how to use appropriate computer hardware and software and how to apply cluster sampling theory in the local environment. RSM was used for the first time in Hlegu Township, Burma, to conduct a health survey of young children. The survey team started the field work on May 4, 1987. Four days later, while still in the field, the data were processed and rapidly analyzed by portable microcomputers for presentation to the local township medical officer and his staff. Within 10 days of starting the field work, we issued a detailed 50-page report of the study findings. This paper provides (a) a description of the components of rapid survey methodology, including the sample survey method, computer hardware, and computer software; (b) the general requirements for portable computer hardware in less developed regions of the world; (c) the procedures for doing a rapid survey; and (d) a summary of our experiences with RSM in Burma.\r"

  ".W": "More than 8 of 10 intravenous drug users infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are black or Hispanic. Recognizing that sociocultural factors affect HIV transmission, public health officials have called for interventions designed for ethnic-racial minority groups. Considered in this paper are the nature and extent of AIDS among ethnic-racial minorities and the cultural aspects of drug use and sexual behavior related to HIV transmission. That drug users and their associates are practicing safer needle use is evident; that they are changing their sexual behavior is less so. Calling for rapid advances in knowledge and expanded efforts in intervention, Federal agencies have instituted numerous programs to support innovative research and demonstration projects in ethnic-racial minority communities. Needed are studies that (a) describe the phenomena of drug use and sexual behavior among ethnic-racial minority populations, (b) establish the efficacy of culturally specific AIDS prevention strategies in drug treatment and community settings, and (c) demonstrate new ways of recruiting, treating, and reducing relapse among drug users.\r"

  ".W": "Surveys are often deemed necessary in developing countries when routine sources of data are not considered adequate to answer important policy-related questions. Although field work often goes smoothly, many surveys become bogged down in the analysis stage. With the availability of microcomputers and contemporary software, investigators in developing countries can use rapid survey methodology (RSM) to process, analyze, and report survey findings more quickly than ever before. Presented in this paper are three simple analytic procedures for planning and doing two-stage, rapid cluster surveys. All were successfully used in three rapid surveys in rural regions of Burma and Thailand. By use of a spreadsheet and graphics software package, the three procedures (a) derive the first-stage selection of 30 cluster sites with probability proportionate to size, (b) calculate variance estimates and confidence limits for the parameters of interest and graphically present the findings as 90, 95, and 99 percent confidence intervals, and (c) estimate the necessary sample size for planning two-stage, rapid cluster surveys. The procedures can be used both in the field and in teaching workshops or courses on survey methods. Examples are given from three rapid surveys conducted in Hlegu Township, Burma, and Sisaket Province, Thailand. In both countries, local health professionals were first taught the methods in a 1-week workshop before they used the procedure for conducting the rapid computer-assisted surveys.\r"

Three theoretical screening situations were proposed, screening in the workplace for genetic susceptibility to work-related disease, carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, and presymptomatic testing for Huntington disease. Of the respondents, 72 percent thought screening in the workplace should be voluntary, and 81 percent said employers should have no access without the worker's consent, including 22 percent who believed that employers should have no access at all. There was strong consensus in all but one nation that insurance companies should have no access to test results without the worker's consent, and strong consensus in two countries that they should have no access at all. Most (82 percent) believed that screening for cystic fibrosis should be applied to the entire population, but 18 percent believed that it should be applied primarily to Caucasians. In all, 66 percent of respondents believed that individuals at risk for Huntington disease should be told their test results only if they say that they wish to know, recognizing a \"right not to know\" whether they will develop the disease in later life. Twelve percent thought that spouses should have access to test results if they asked, and 26 percent thought that spouses should be informed of results even if they did not ask. Geneticists in all nations were vividly aware of the potential damage from third party access to results, especially access by insurance companies. They had little sympathy with insurers' needs to assess actuarially accurate premiums.\r"

The analytic cohort consisted of 122 breast cancer cases and 7,304 noncases, with a median followup time of 10 years. We found no appreciable increase in risk among women who reported their onset of menarche as occurring before the age of 13 compared with those reporting onset at ages 13 and older. Breast cancer risk was progressively elevated with increasing age at first live birth (test for trend, P less than 0.007). The number of children born to a woman did not influence risk, but the data suggested an increased risk for nulliparous women. A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative was the strongest predictor of risk for this cohort of women, with relative risks of 2.2 and 2.4 associated with a mother or sister affected with breast cancer, compared with women having no family history. The age of natural menopause had little influence on breast cancer risk, and the data suggested a slight protective effect of early surgical menopause. Higher education (compared with less than a high school education) was associated with an increased risk in this cohort of women (relative risk (RR) = 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval (CI) = 0.9-5.1). These results (a) confirm the importance of some well-recognized risk factors for breast cancer in a cohort of women, followed prospectively for 10 years, and perhaps more importantly, (b) uniquely provide risk estimates on a probability sample of women in the United States.\r"

It is associated with the practice of putting the child to sleep with a nursing bottle filled with liquid that contains sugar. Practitioners who treat Native American children have noted that this population suffers from a high prevalence of the condition. In order to establish specific program priorities and treatment needs for this segment of the Native American population, additional information is required on both prevalence and severity of baby bottle tooth decay. In this survey, an overall prevalence of 70 percent was observed when Navajo and Cherokee Head Start students ages 4-5 years were examined. Of the children affected by baby bottle tooth decay, 87 percent displayed the most severe manifestation of the disease. The prevalence of this disease in these Native American children appears to be substantially higher than in other populations. Further study is needed to identify the factors contributing to this difference in prevalence and to identify effective measures for reducing the occurrence of baby bottle tooth decay among Native Americans.\r"

A simplified qualitative presence-absence test has been proposed as an alternate procedure for detecting coliform bacteria in potable water. In this paper data from four comparative studies were analyzed to compare the recovery of total coliform bacteria from drinking water using the presence-absence test, the multiple fermentation tube procedure, and the membrane filter technique. The four studies were of water samples taken from four different geographic areas of the United States: Hawaii, New England (Vermont and New Hampshire), Oregon, and Pennsylvania. Analysis of the results of these studies were compared, based upon the number of positive samples detected by each method. Combined recoveries showed the presence-absence test detected significantly higher numbers of samples with coliforms than either the fermentation tube or membrane filter methods, P less than 0.01. The fermentation tube procedure detected significantly more positive samples than the membrane filter technique, P less than 0.01. Based upon the analysis of the combined data base, it is clear that the presence-absence test is as sensitive as the current coliform methods for the examination of potable water. The presence-absence test offers a viable alternative to water utility companies that elect to use the frequency-of-occurrence approach for compliance monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "We analyzed previously unavailable data to describe the national health status in 1981 of noninstitutionalized children who were low birth weight infants. They were compared with normal birth weight children. All data contained in the analysis were based on weighted national estimates. Low birth weight children in general were found to have more chronic conditions, more hospitalizations, more days in bed because of illness, more limitations of activity, poorer health status as perceived by parents, and more school days lost because of illness. However, numbers of physician visits were not different even for low birth weight children younger than 2 years, which is inconsistent with the higher proportions of multiple hospitalizations, chronic conditions, and other illness measures. The proportions of children in the younger age groups at risk for health problems associated with low birth weight should be increasing. The proportion of very low birth weight children in the younger age groups with higher excessive morbidity measures tends to support the possibility. The increased survival of high-risk infants raises concern about their future requirements for special medical and educational services, and about the resulting stress on their families. Normal birth weight children were found to make a major contribution to the prevalence of morbidity. It is not the children identified as at risk as a result of low birth weight that comprise most of those with illnesses. The physical, social, and psychological environment after birth probably has the largest impact on the health status of our children. The attributable risk of excessive morbidity associated with low birth weight and very low birth weight reinforces the concept that while the overall impact is not large, the consistent pattern of poorer health for children born with low birth weight, compared to those of normal birth weight, shown in this analysis, is striking. The pattern reinforces concerns with the many factors associated with low birth weight and their effects on the present and future health of the population.\r"

A sequential approach has been used by the Centers for Disease Control and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry in investigating potential exposure to and health effects resulting from environmental contamination with materials such as heavy metals, volatile organic compounds, and pesticide residues at sites throughout the United States. The strategy consists of four phases: site evaluation, pilot studies of exposure or health effects, analytic epidemiology studies, and public health surveillance. This approach offers a logical, phased strategy to use limited personnel and financial resources of local, State, national, or global health agency jurisdictions optimally in evaluating populations potentially exposed to hazardous materials in waste sites. Primarily, this approach is most helpful in identifying sites for etiologic studies and providing investigative leads to direct and focus these studies. The results of such studies provide information needed for making risk-management decisions to mitigate or eliminate human exposures and for developing interventions to prevent or minimize health problems resulting from exposures that already have occurred.\r"

At present, the only way to reduce this risk is through education. In an effort to increase AIDS education among adolescents, a program called Students Teaching AIDS to Students (STATS) is proposed. The goal of this project is to help train medical students to become AIDS educators in the schools, churches, and youth organizations of their local communities. The project involves preparation and distribution of a package of materials which can be used by medical students to initiate a STATS program. The package consists of a manual which explains the essentials of starting a youth health education project, suggests how to gain approval for the project within the community, and contains curriculums with basic AIDS information and exercises. The curriculum material is tailored for presentation to students over two school-class periods on separate days and contains age-appropriate information. Another component of the package is the slide show tailored to explain STATS to school boards, parent groups, and the leaders of other youth organizations. A video tape to help answer difficult questions put by students has been selected to be part of the curriculum for school grade levels 7 to 12. These materials are geared to facilitate the start of a successful AIDS education program for adolescents.\r"

  ".W": "Youths of today are forced to deal with the external pressures of alcohol and drug abuse on all levels-from the older youngsters across the street pressuring them to be \"cool,\" to the \"cute dog\" enticing them with the glamour of being the original \"party animal.\" Through today's mass communications, young people are exposed to negative, self-destructive attitudes. It is important, therefore, to expose them to a more positive influence and try to reach them through parental guidance, personal contact, and peer pressure. To achieve this, the University of Missouri's Kansas City Chapter of the American Pharmaceutical Association's Academy of Students of Pharmacy, in conjunction with the Metropolitan Kansas City Area Task Force on Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse, proposed the development of an annual drug abuse prevention program that specifically targets fifth graders in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area. A primary goal of Project Outreach (Organizations Unified to Reach Youth) is to unite drug abuse prevention programs in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area in their outreach efforts to give positive support to Kansas City's youth against alcohol and other drugs. Phase I of Project Outreach consisted of a series of programs for the parents in the community. Phase II entailed college students who spoke to fifth graders in their classrooms. These students also participated in poster and poem contents centered around drug abuse prevention. In Phase III, which featured an outstanding, motivated speaker, the sample group of 600 fifth graders in the area participated in a major event to give positive peer pressure to say no to drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Factors contributing to smoking initiation include peer pressure, family and social influences, cigarette availability, and cigarette advertising. Because three-quarters of smokers become dependent on cigarettes by age 20, smoking prevention programs aimed at the adolescent population have great potential. The proposed program outlined is directed at girls 12 to 18 years of age in New York City. Among the objectives are increasing students' knowledge of the short- and long-term health effects of smoking and awareness of the social factors which lead to smoking. Participants would be taught social skills and behaviors which could help them to resist initiating smoking, by such activities as assertiveness training through role playing. Endurance sports activities would be emphasized while learning of the effects of smoking on physical conditioning. The costs of such a program are estimated, and classroom activities are outlined.\r"

Formaldehyde-fixed, intact cells were hybridized with fluorescently labeled oligodeoxynucleotides complementary to 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and viewed by fluorescence microscopy. Because of the abundance of rRNA in cells, the binding of the fluorescent probes to individual cells is readily visualized. Phylogenetic identification is achieved by the use of oligonucleotides (length 17 to 34 nucleotides) that are complementary to phylogenetic group-specific 16S rRNA sequences. Appropriate probes can be composed of oligonucleotide sequences that distinguish between the primary kingdoms (eukaryotes, eubacteria, archaebacteria) and between closely related organisms. The simultaneous use of multiple probes, labeled with different fluorescent dyes, allows the identification of different cell types in the same microscopic field. Quantitative microfluorimetry shows that the amount of an rRNA-specific probe that binds to Escherichia coli varies with the ribosome content and therefore reflects growth rate.\r"

Our analysis by outcome (ie, survival vs death) of 3,329 patients with insulin-dependent or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus showed that the 242 diabetes-related deaths were associated with a much more intense use of hospital resources and a substantial financial risk under DRG pricing schemes, compared with the 3,087 diabetic survivors. Only deaths within one week of admission to the hospital were profitable under DRGs. Patients who died after a hospital stay of more than 60 days generated a loss of $28,377 per patient. Diabetic patients who died after emergency admission tended to have a shorter hospitalization and to pose less financial risk under DRGs than those who died after nonemergency admission. Those who died after referral from other clinical services tended to have greater use of resources and to pose greater financial risk under DRGs than those not referred. These data suggest significant inequities in the current Medicare DRG prospective payment system vis-a-vis deaths from diabetes. Long hospitalization, nonemergency admission, and referral from another clinical service were shown to be good predictors of greater use of hospital resources for diabetic patients who died. However, since hospitals are not compensated for the increased utilization, diabetic patients may suffer a decline in quality of and/or access to medical care in the future.\r"

Results of the usual blood tests for assessment of thyroid function, such as T4, T3, and thyrotropin determinations, were not uniformly diagnostic, and were potentially misleading. An increased T4 level, a nonsuppressed TSH level, normal levels of FT4 and FT4D, and a low level of T3RU were clues that led to a request for specific measurement of serum TBG levels in multiple family members; family testing was essential for the diagnosis of euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia due to familial hepatic overproduction of TBG.\r"

  ".W": "Plasma triglyceride turnover was measured during steady-state conditions in 22 postoperative patients. Nine had received nutritional support with an enteral regimen, seven had received an equivalent regimen as continuous parenteral nutrition, and six received the same parenteral regimen as a cyclical infusion. After 5 days of nutritional support, each patient received an intravenous bolus of tritiated glycerol. Plasma radiolabeled triglyceride content was measured during the subsequent 24 hours. The data were analyzed by means of a simple deterministic model of plasma triglyceride kinetics and compared with the results obtained by stochastic analysis. The rates of hepatic triglyceride secretion obtained by deterministic analysis were higher than those obtained by the stochastic approach. However, the mode of delivery of the nutritional regimen did not affect the rate of hepatic triglyceride secretion regardless of the method of analysis. The results suggest that neither complete nutritional bypass of the gastrointestinal tract nor interruption of parenteral nutrition in an attempt to mimic normal eating has any effect on hepatic triglyceride secretion. Any beneficial effect that enteral feeding or cyclical parenteral nutrition may have on liver dysfunction associated with standard parenteral nutrition appears to be unrelated to changes in hepatic triglyceride secretion.\r"

Under halothane anesthesia, the left middle cerebral artery was occluded via a transretro-orbital approach. YM-14673 was administered just after the operation and once a day for 3 weeks. Neurologic deficits, including hemiplegia and abnormal posture, and disturbance of passive avoidance learning were present in solvent-treated control rats for the entire 3 weeks. YM-14673 at 0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg i.p. or 1 mg/kg p.o. significantly accelerated the recovery of neurologic deficits and ameliorated cognitive disturbance compared with the solvent-treated controls although the drug at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.p. did not influence the size of the ischemic infarct. YM-14673 mitigated the behavioral disturbances in this model of chronic focal cerebral ischemia. We also discuss the suitability of this model for the evaluation of drugs.\r"

Subarachnoid injection of blood caused a significant sixfold increase in Evans blue extravasation, whereas sham operation or NaCl injection had no effect. In addition, subarachnoid injections of arachidonic acid or FeCl2 increased blood-brain barrier permeability to Evans blue 16- and 10-fold, respectively. The capillary permeability after subarachnoid injection of blood was normalized by pretreatment with a novel 21-aminosteroid, U-74006F, that has antioxidant and antilipolytic activity. Pretreatment with U-74006F also reduced the vascular leakage induced by subarachnoid injection of arachidonic acid or FeCl2 by 50% and 45%, respectively. We conclude that damage to membrane lipids by peroxidative and/or lipolytic processes is involved in the subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced blood-brain barrier opening and that U-74006F protects the blood-brain barrier against the effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage by preventing or limiting these pathologic membrane lipid changes.\r"

This study used a detailed economic analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of several techniques for platelet crossmatching and that of HLA-matched single-donor platelets. The crossmatch methods evaluated were a microlymphocytotoxicity test (LCT), an immunofluorescence technique (PSIFT), a radioactive antiglobulin test (PRAT), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The analysis was based on the need to support 100 refractory patients with acute leukemia with a presumed requirement of 500 transfusions. The relative costs for a successful crossmatch were: PRAT less than LCT less than LCT + PRAT less than PSIFT less than ELISA. In the comparison of the crossmatch methods, an increase in costs was generally associated with an increase in the number of successful transfusion episodes. However, decreasing marginal gains were seen. The HLA-matched single-donor platelets were relatively cost-inefficient in comparison to the crossmatch-compatible platelets. A theoretic sequence of tests for cost-effective provision of optimal platelet support in refractory patients was evaluated. Such considerations of cost are important in the selection of an optimal program for the management of alloimmunized refractory thrombocytopenic patients.\r"

A thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor, CV-4151, and a lipoxygenase inhibitor, AA-861, greatly reduced the infarct size. They also attenuated the production of chemoattractant leukotriene B4 and chemotactic activity of neutrophils isolated from peripheral circulation. Under these conditions, both the increases in peripheral leukocyte count and neutrophil infiltration in ischemic myocardium were inhibited. These results indicate that the inhibition of 2 pathways of arachidonate metabolism may decrease infiltration of activated neutrophils in ischemic myocardium by attenuating chemotactic function of neutrophils, resulting in reduction of the extent of myocardial infarction.\r"

Patients demonstrated initial hemodynamic responsiveness to sublingual nitroglycerin and were titrated to a maximally tolerated dose of 30 to 60 mg/24 hours (52 +/- 5 mg). Two crossover phases were use in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled manner: continuous nitroglycerin therapy (patches containing active drug worn for 24 hours) and intermittent nitroglycerin therapy (12-hour active drug followed by a 12-hour nitrate-free period). There were no differences in frequency or duration of ischemic episodes between the placebo days of each phase. A significant effect in frequency of episodes was observed between placebo and treatment days of continuous therapy (p less than 0.05). Nonsignificant reductions in frequency and duration of ischemic episodes also occurred during intermittent therapy. The major antiischemic effect of transdermal nitroglycerin therapy occurred during the first day of treatment but was lost by 48 hours. Reductions in frequency and duration of ischemic episodes (p less than 0.05) were present on day 1 of continuous therapy but ischemic episodes returned to placebo levels by day 2, suggesting the development of tolerance. Intermittent therapy did not prevent the development of tolerance on day 2 of treatment. The results demonstrate that the use of high doses of transdermal nitroglycerin in patients with chronic, stable coronary artery disease produced a beneficial reduction in the frequency and duration of ischemia. However, the antiischemic benefit was lost between 24 nd 48 hours after the onset of continuous and intermittent therapy, presumably due to tolerance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The treatment was considered successful if sinus rhythm occurred within 1 hour. Of 20 patients receiving flecainide, 14 of 17 (82%) with AF converted to sinus rhythm, but in 3 patients with AFI flecainide failed. All patients treated with verapamil (17 AF, 3 AFI) showed lower ventricular rates after 1 hour; however, only 1 (6%) with AF converted to sinus rhythm and 1 (6%) converted to AFI. Patients who did not convert to sinus rhythm after treatment with verapamil were treated with flecainide and observed for another hour. After the change to flecainide, 9 of 15 patients (60%) with AF still converted. Thus, 23 of 32 patients (72%) with AF and none of 7 with AFI converted to sinus rhythm after treatment with flecainide. Conversion to sinus rhythm was achieved in 19 of 22 patients (86%) when AF lasted less than 24 hours and in 4 of 10 (40%) when the arrhythmia lasted greater than 24 hours. Transient adverse effects were noted in 10 patients (26%) after flecainide. In summary, flecainide is an effective and safe drug for conversion of paroxysmal AF to sinus rhythm, but ineffective for AFI. Verapamil appears to be of no use for conversion of AF or AFI to sinus rhythm.\r"

Serum folate concentrations were significantly lower from 45 to 150 min after one or both fiber-containing meals relative to the fiber-free meal.

  ".W": "A simple and objective assay was developed for the detection and quantitation of fetal-maternal hemorrhage with the use of flow cytometry. In vitro prepared control mixtures of 10%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.125%, and 0.06% D+ RBCs in D- RBCs were tested (8-11) different times by flow cytometry and gave mean % D+ results of 11.10%, 1.90%, 0.92%, 0.45%, 0.24%, 0.11%, and 0.05%. The coefficient of variation of preparing and testing these mixtures ranged from 11.0 to 15.9% for the 10-0.125% mixtures. Thus, flow cytometry was accurate, reproducible, and sensitive. Flow cytometry was compared with Du tests, rosette tests, and acid elution. The Du test was highly variable because it was not sensitive enough to detect a significant bleed (approximately 0.6%) in some cases and too sensitive (necessitating quantitation of an insignificant bleed) in others. The rosette test was too sensitive. Acid elution and flow cytometry results did not always agree; acid elution results were approximately twice as high as flow cytometry. The authors believe flow cytometric detection of D+ red blood cells to be more accurate than the detection of fetal hemoglobin by acid elution techniques, which is known to have poor reproducibility. Postpartum samples from 56 D- women who delivered D+ babies were tested. Fifty-two had fetal bleeds less than 0.3% by acid elution and flow cytometry; all had negative Du test results, but there were two false positive results with the use of the rosette technique. Four had significant bleeds (greater than or equal to 0.6%); in all four cases the flow cytometry results were lower than the acid elution results. The authors were able to quantitate a bleed of fetal RBCs, which were D+ only by the Du test, in a D- mother with the use of flow cytometry, and D+ RBCs in a mother whose RBCs were of the rare DVI mosaic phenotype. This would not have been possible with the use of the standard Du or rosette techniques.\r"

Mycobacterial cultures had positive results from 35%. Sensitivity of fluorescent staining was 72% and specificity was found to be 94%. If the fluorescent stain had positive results, the positive predictive value for recovering Mycobacteria on culture was 87%. Fluorescent microscopy with the use of Truant's auramine-rhodamine staining of routinely processed bone marrow aspirates and biopsies is a fairly sensitive, very specific, and rapid technique for determining the presence of Mycobacteria in bone marrow specimens from patients with HIV infection.\r"

Both the secreted and cell-associated PA activity in cultured canine keratinocytes were completely inhibited by specific anti-urokinase antibodies. Anti-tissue type PA antibodies did not inhibit either secreted or cell-associated PA activity. Immunoblots and fibrin zymography revealed a single 57,000 molecular weight urokinase-type PA in the conditioned media of the canine oral keratinocytes. Incubation of the differentiated cultures with PV Ig resulted in a significant increased in the levels of PA activity and both canine and human PV Ig were effective at inducing acantholysis typical of that seen in the clinical disease. The addition of urokinase inhibitor to the cultures treated with PV Ig prevented the development of acantholysis. These data strongly support the conclusion that PA is involved in acantholysis which is the cardinal feature of PV.\r"

A dose of 30 picomoles of LTB4 was required to elicit a significant extravascular dermal accumulation of neutrophils (P less than 0.05). In contrast, 1.0 nanomole of LTB5 was required to achieve a cellular influx equivalent to that elicited by 30 picomoles of LTB4. Nearly five times as many neutrophils were present in the bovine dermis injected with 1.0 nanomole of LTB4 compared with sites given the equivalent dose of LTB5 (245 cells/sq mm vs. 52 cells/sq mm). Six nanomoles of either 5-HETE or 5-HEPE were required before a significant neutrophil accumulation occurred. These results show clearly that 5-lipoxygenase metabolites can initiate the extravascular accumulation of bovine neutrophils in vivo. However, the chemotactic potency of the EPA metabolites is much reduced when compared with that of the homologous AA lipids. The results obtained support the premise that modification of the inflammatory response, including control of cellular influxes, by dietary supplementation with EPA is feasible.\r"

Long-term post-BMT pathologic and biochemical studies were performed on three groups of dogs: 1) MPS I-affected dogs that did not receive BMT, 2) MPS I-affected dogs that received total body irradiation followed by an allogeneic BMT, and 3) normal, unaffected dogs that served as BMT donors. All dogs were necropsied at approximately 20 months after BMT. The severity of MPS I-related lesions in the dogs receiving BMT was greatly diminished. These dogs had only slight cardiac valvular thickening, no meningeal thickening, no renal tubular epithelial vacuolation, decreased neuronal vacuolation, decreased corneal stromal vacuolation, and greatly diminished arterial medial thickening. The severity and incidence of degenerative arthropathy also were decreased in BMT dogs, however, vertebral lesions were similar to nontransplanted, affected dogs. Chondrocytes of both MPS I-BMT and MPS I-no BMT groups had similar marked cytoplasmic vacuolation, except for MPS I-BMT chondrocytes near the articular surface, which had more normal morphology. Ultrastructurally, the liver and kidney tissue in BMT recipients had no appreciable lysosomal accumulation of GAGs. These morphologic findings were supported by near normal levels and electrophoretic patterns of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in most tissues of BMT recipient dogs. This study demonstrates that BMT is capable of substantially diminishing the severity of MPS I-related lesions in this canine model.\r"

  ".W": "Clinical studies have suggested that baroreflex regulation of heart rate may be more affected by inhalational anesthetics in human neonates or young animals than in adults. To test this hypothesis, baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate was studied in eight neonates during administration of 1 MAC isoflurane. The neonates were hemodynamically stable and their lungs were mechanically ventilated. No other anesthetic was used. Mean (+/- SD) corrected gestational age was 39.4 +/- 2.0 weeks and mean weight was 2,710 +/- 430 g. The pressor response was tested with the use of phenylephrine and the depressor response with nitroglycerin. Changes in heart rate (R-R interval) were plotted against the changes in systolic arterial pressure, and the slope of the linear portion of this relationship was used to define the baroreflex response. Both baroresponses measured in awake neonates varied widely between patients. With administration of approximately 1 MAC isoflurane, the pretest mean systolic arterial pressure decreased by about 30% (P less than 0.001), whereas mean heart rate values remained unchanged compared with control awake values. During isoflurane administration, the mean (+/- SD) pressor response decreased to 23% of control awake values (11.2 +/- 7.7 ms/mmHg vs. 2.6 +/- 3.7 ms/mmHg; P less than 0.01) and the depressor response to 28% of control (4.3 +/- 3.2 ms/mmHg vs. 1.2 +/- 0.8 ms/mmHg; P less than 0.05). These changes can be attributed to a significant resetting of heart rate itself (calculated as the change in R-R interval at a constant pressure).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of different protein regimens on pulmonary gas exchange and ventilatory drive were examined in eight postoperative patients receiving inspiratory pressure support ventilation. They were studied during 60 consecutive hours, which included two 12-h periods of high protein intake (33%) of total caloric intake provided as protein), each of them being preceded and followed by a 12-h period of standard protein intake (14% of total caloric intake provided as protein). Throughout the study, total caloric intake was 1.5 times the predicted resting energy expenditure. Nitrogen was provided as a 24% branched chain amino acid (BCAA) solution during the period of standard protein intake. During the periods of high protein intake, it was provided as a 24% and a 41% BCAA solution. Pulmonary gas exchange was continuously measured during the second half of each period, with the use of a mass spectrometer system. Measurements of the ventilatory response to CO2 (FICO2 0, 1.5, and 3%) were achieved at the end of each dietary regimen. O2 consumption, CO2 production, respiratory quotient, minute ventilation, and PaCO2 were the same for the three protein regimens. Changing protein intake failed to affect the ventilatory response to CO2. The authors conclude that, in postoperative patients having inspiratory pressure support ventilation, the administration of a high protein intake does not affect the ventilatory drive and the pulmonary gas exchange.\r"

Ketamine did not affect resting respiratory rate, tidal volume, end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2), or minute ventilation. Five minutes after the ketamine bolus, the slope VE/PETCO2 decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) from 1.71 +/- 0.47 to 1.05 +/- 0.23 1.min-1.mmHg-1 (mean +/- SD). After 30 min of continuous iv ketamine infusion, the slope returned to 1.65 +/- 0.44 1.min-1.mmHg-1, a significantly higher value (P less than 0.05) compared with the nadir and not significantly different from control. The minute ventilation at a PETCO2 of 60 mmHg decreased from 824 +/- 98 to 626 +/- 26 ml.kg-1.min-1 5 min after iv ketamine, and remained depressed (640 +/- 125 ml.kg-1.min-1 P less than 0.05) throughout the 30-min ketamine infusion. In addition, the slope VT/PETCO2 and the VT 60 did not change during the study; nonetheless, the slope f/PETCO2 and the f 60 decreased significantly following iv bolus ketamine, and the f 60 remained significantly decreased following ketamine infusion. The authors conclude that clinically useful doses of iv ketamine significantly alter ventilatory control in children.\r"

Control MAC in each group was determined by the tail-clamp method. Each animal in groups 1 and 2 received four iv incremental doses of flumazenil: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 4.5 mg/kg, and isoflurane MAC or enflurane MAC was determined after each dose. The animals in group 3 received a loading dose and a continuous infusion of fentanyl 0.8 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 over 8 h, and enflurane MAC was determined four times during this experimental period. After the fourth enflurane MAC determination in each animal of group 3, a single iv dose of flumazenil 1.5 mg/kg was injected and enflurane MAC was then determined for the last time. In the incremental doses administered, flumazenil did not demonstrate any agonistic or antagonistic interaction with isoflurane, enflurane, or the fentanyl-enflurane combination. In group 3, plasma fentanyl concentrations remained stable at 12.5 +/- 3.0 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) throughout the experiment and reduced enflurane MAC by 60 +/- 8%. The addition of flumazenil changed neither the fentanyl concentration in plasma (12.2 +/- 3.8 ng/ml) nor its reduction of enflurane MAC (61 +/- 7%). In conclusion, the absence of effect of flumazenil on the MAC of enflurane, isoflurane, or a fentanyl-enflurane combination suggests that they do not interact with the benzodiazepine receptor.\r"

In hypocapnic animals, mean values for L-CMRg were higher in 25 out of 26 structures studied. The increase in L-CMRg was heterogenous. The structures that had higher L-CMRg during normocapnia showed the greatest increase in L-CMRg.

An active control interval of 2 weeks on cromolyn sodium capsules was followed by a 4-week single-blind period on placebo capsules. Those subjects whose asthma worsened significantly on placebo entered a 10-week double-blind phase, randomized to receive either cromolyn sodium (2 mg per dose) or placebo by MDI. Diary data, physician evaluation, and pulmonary function tests were used to assess efficacy, and scores were compared with the baseline value at 2-week intervals. Forty children with asthma, 8 to 20 years of age, entered the study and 32 qualified for the randomized phase. No significant differences existed between the treatment groups at baseline. Most comparative data favored the cromolyn sodium group over the course of the study. Significant differences (p less than .05) were noted for diary scores of breathlessness and overall asthma severity. There was significant improvement at the final visit favoring the cromolyn sodium group in restriction on normal activity, FEV1, and PEFR. The cromolyn sodium group also experienced a decreasing need for concomitant bronchodilators. Both groups preferred pressurized aerosol by MDI over powdered capsules by Spinhaler.

  ".W": "We studied 68 chronic asthmatic patients, 18 to 76 yr of age, with a percent predicted FEV1 between 33 and 81, comparing cromolyn sodium with placebo. We used a double-blind, comparative group trial design. A 4-wk baseline period was followed by 3 months of active treatment or placebo. Patients recorded symptom severity and frequency of study drug and concomitant medication usage on daily diary cards. At each clinic visit, patients independently assessed the effectiveness of the test medication in controlling their asthma. Physicians also assessed the severity of the patients' symptoms, pulmonary function, and effectiveness of test medication at monthly intervals. Methacholine challenges were done pre- and post-treatment. Use of concomitant therapy was reduced according to a specified schedule. There was significant improvement in the severity of daytime asthma, nighttime asthma, and cough as assessed by the patients in the cromolyn sodium group. Mean use of concomitant medications decreased significantly in cromolyn sodium patients. Despite the reductions in the use of bronchodilators, pulmonary function (FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75) improved significantly in the cromolyn sodium group. Similar improvements did not occur in the control group. The physicians' assessments of symptoms showed significant improvement in favor of the cromolyn sodium group. Both physicians and patients judged cromolyn sodium to be moderately or very effective for 61% of the patients as compared to 27% (by physicians) and 24% (by patients) in the placebo group. There was no significant difference in methacholine response between the two groups, although the mean value for methacholine sensitivity in the cromolyn sodium group was significantly less at the end of the study than at baseline.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 5 has been evaluated as a serodiagnostic test for active tuberculosis in children. Forty children of either sex, ages 1 to 14 yr, were studied, including 21 bacteriologically confirmed tuberculous patients and 19 control subjects who were evaluated for tuberculosis and found to be free of disease. At a 1:20 dilution, the test showed a sensitivity of 0.857 and a specificity of 1.000, with an accuracy value of 0.925, a positive predictive value of 1.000, and a negative predictive value of 0.864. The prevalence of disease calculated directly from the data of the study was found to be of 0.525. The geometric mean ELISA titer of the tuberculosis group was 1:58, and the difference in antibody titers between patient and control groups was found to be statistically significant (p less than 0.001). From our results, we conclude that ELISA using M. tuberculosis antigen 5 may be useful in those situations of high prevalence of disease when children suspected of tuberculosis are being evaluated.\r"

SETTING: Referral center for patients with heart failure. PATIENTS: Thirty patients with severe chronic heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%. INTERVENTIONS: Invasive hemodynamic measurements were done (using a balloon-tipped thermodilution catheter) before and for 3 hours after a single oral dose of 50 mg of encainide. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety to one hundred and twenty minutes after its administration, encainide produced a significant deterioration in cardiac performance, as reflected by a fall in cardiac index from 2.3 to 1.8 L/min.m2 body surface (mean change 0.5 +/- 0.1; P less than 0.001), a fall in stroke work index from 26 to 18 g.m/m2 (mean change 8 +/- 2; P less than 0.001), and an increase in left ventricular filling pressure from 19 to 22 mm Hg (mean change 3 +/- 2; P less than 0.05). These deleterious hemodynamic effects were accompanied by worsening symptoms of heart failure in 8 of the 30 patients. Serum levels of encainide and its metabolites, O-desmethylencainide and 3-methoxy-O-desmethylencainide, were within the therapeutic range in most patients. CONCLUSIONS: Encainide can cause adverse hemodynamic and clinical effects in patients with severe chronic heart failure.\r"

In 11 normal animals, the bicarbonate in endolymph was 20.2 mM +/- 4,4 mM (mean +/- standard deviation); in six of these, plasma bicarbonate was 23.1 mM +/- 3.5 mM. Nine animals treated with methazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) had an endolymph bicarbonate of 19.5 mM +/- 3.9 mM; plasma bicarbonate in five of these was 25 mM +/- 3.2 mM. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition did not significantly affect endolymphatic bicarbonate levels.\r"

We describe the first non-Japanese cases of schwannomatosis and compare and contrast this unusual condition with the well-known variants of neurofibromatosis. We conclude that the features of schwannomatosis are distinct and define a condition that does not fit into the current classification scheme of neurofibromatosis. The occurrence of multiple cutaneous schwannomas in the absence of cardinal features of neurofibromatosis may indicate the presence of central nervous system tumors or various neurologic deficits.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and thirty hepatic resections performed over an 8-year period were reviewed for evidence of postoperative intra-abdominal sepsis. Of 126 patients who survived for more than 24 hours after operation, 36 developed culture positive intra-abdominal collections (28.6%). Significant independent variables associated with the development of intra-abdominal sepsis were diagnoses of trauma or cholangiocarcinoma, and the need for reoperation to control hemorrhage during the postoperative period. Before 1984, infected fluid collections were treated predominantly by operative drainage, but this has largely been replaced by percutaneous methods, which have proven effective in most cases. Eighteen (50%) of the infections were caused by a mixed bacterial culture, with Streptococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common isolates. Six patients with clinical signs of sepsis had a sterile fluid collection drained with complete relief of symptoms. This review suggests that intra-abdominal sepsis is a frequent complication after hepatic resection, and can often be managed successfully by nonoperative percutaneous drainage.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the possible role of prostacyclin (PGI2) as a mediator of the splanchnic hyperemia seen with portal hypertension, the portal and mesenteric hemodynamics in normal and portal hypertensive rabbits were studied before and after cyclo-oxygenase blockade. Three weeks after partial portal vein ligation, splenic pulp pressure was elevated from 4.3 +/- 0.9 to 9.8 +/- 0.8 mmHg (p less than 0.01). Mesenteric blood flow increased from 77.0 +/- 4.7 ml.min-1.100 g-1 to 99.1 +/- 5.19 ml/min-1/100 g-1. Mesenteric vascular resistance fell from 0.82 +/- 0.6 mmHg/ml-1/min-1 to 0.49 +/- 0.07 mmHg/ml-1/min-1 (p less than 0.01). These hemodynamic changes were associated with a 27.3 +/- 0.2% rise in systemic arterial levels of PGI2 (p less than 0.01) and were substantially ameliorated by cyclo-oxygenase blockade with indomethacin. The effects of indomethacin blockade were reversed by exogenous PGI2. Moreover, in normotensive rabbits, infusion of PGI2 reproduced the splanchnic hyperemia and caused a very small but significant increase in portosystemic shunting. These findings support the previously proposed concept that splanchnic hyperemia may contribute to the maintenance of chronic portal hypertension. Furthermore, they suggest that this effect may be partially mediated by splanchnic PGI2 production.\r"

Feeding either 150 kcal/kg/day or 175 kcal/kg/day caused death in all 25 animals (p less than 0.001) and their survival time was slightly shortened (p = NS) when compared with animals receiving 100 or 125 kcal/kg/day. This is the first animal model of peritonitis that permits incisive dissection of the relative influences of dietary composition on outcome, because survival can be extended to 2 weeks or more in the presence of continuing sepsis.\r"

Fundus photographs were performed before injection and at six and 24 hours after injection. Vascular caliber was assessed by a previously described technique of performing measurements on fundus photographs taken and projected in a standardized fashion. No significant vascular dilation was identified for vehicle alone, carbachol, histamine, isoproterenol hydrochloride, or bradykinin. Mild dilation within one hour, but not persisting for 24 hours, was noted for dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate. Prominent dilation within one hour, becoming maximal by five hours but not persisting for 24 hours, was noted for adenosine, dipyridamole, and sodium nitroprusside. The adenosine-induced vasodilation was effectively blocked by an adenosine receptor antagonist, BW-A1433U. N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), a nonspecific adenosine selective agonist, was a much more potent vasodilator than two relatively selective A1 adenosine agonists, N6-cyclopentyladenosine and N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, suggesting that A2 receptors are involved. The vascular dilation caused by adenosine, dipyridamole, and particularly NECA, but not nitroprusside or dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, was accompanied by retinal hemorrhages, producing a picture reminiscent of some features of ischemic retinopathies. This study suggests that adenosine may be an important mediator of vasodilation, and therefore blood flow, in the retina.\r"

Each group used a different production lot of CSM and K-Sol. Group 1 comprised ten corneal pairs, and groups 2 and 3 each comprised six corneal pairs. In group 1, K-Sol provided better preservation for each of the ten corneal pairs, but CSM was equal or possibly superior to K-Sol in groups 2 and 3. Variation between different lots from the same manufacturer probably explains the results, which emphasizes the need for consistency in the composition of these preservative media. Large areas of endothelial cell disruption were found in the periphery of the majority of the corneas. Seven of the 44 corneas had no viable endothelial cells. As storage times increase, methods are needed to detect corneas that are not well preserved. We found no consistent differences in the efficacy of corneal preservation between CSM and K-Sol.\r"

Today, declining Medicare payments to hospitals threaten hospitals' contributions to family practice residency programs.

During mental challenge (playing a video game), patients with essential hypertension had significantly larger increments of NE spillover into arterial blood than did normotensive control subjects, whereas responses of antecubital venous and even arterial NE did not differ significantly between the groups. The rate of neuronal reuptake of endogenous NE can be measured in vivo using plasma levels of NE and of the intraneuronal NE metabolite, dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG). Regional production of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) may reflect catecholamine biosynthesis, and DOPA may be an indirectly acting natriuretic neurohormone. Positron emission tomography after injection of positron-emitting fluorodopamine may allow in vivo, noninvasive assessments of regional sympathetic function.\r"

The primary goal of this study was to determine whether induction of oral cavity carcinoma by dimethylbenzanthracene was accompanied by increased ornithine decarboxylase. It has previously been demonstrated in an oral carcinogenesis model that cotreatment with vitamins A or E delayed tumor development. The second goal of this study was to determine whether this chemoprotective effect was associated with a decrease in ornithine decarboxylase activity. We found that dimethylbenzanthracene did stimulate ornithine decarboxylase. Vitamins A and E alone also stimulate ornithine decarboxylase, and this effect is additive with dimethylbenzanthracene. Use of both vitamins together prevents the additive effect of either, alone, and vitamin A inhibits the late-phase ornithine decarboxylase response to dimethylbenzanthracene in all animals. We conclude that pretreatment with vitamins A, or A and E together protects against the carcinogenic action of dimethylbenzanthracene, and that the mechanism of this protection is early truncation of the ornithine decarboxylase response to dimethylbenzanthracene.\r"

Concentrations were significantly higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction not treated with systemic thrombolysis (60.4 (14.3) pg/ml) than in patients with non-ischaemic chest pain (21.1 (4.3) pg/ml). Patients with ischaemic chest pain had intermediate values (39.3 (7.1) pg/ml). Patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous streptokinase had normal concentrations of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (20.2 (3.6) pg/mg), which were significantly lower than those in patients with myocardial infarction not given streptokinase. These changes could not be explained by factors such as age, pre-existing hypertension, renal dysfunction, or cardiac failure, nor treatment other than streptokinase. Raised plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide in acute myocardial infarction may be a homoeostatic response acting to reduce atrial pressures by natriuresis, diuresis, and venodilatation. The lower concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with streptokinase may reflect a short term beneficial haemodynamic effect of streptokinase.\r"

  ".W": "It has been suggested that Humphrey's ADE system may be an improvement on the Bain system. To compare their efficiencies we have studied 20 anesthetized adults who had controlled ventilation established with a circle absorber system at a VE sufficient to maintain normocapnia. Patients were then randomly allocated to either a Bain or an ADE system. Fresh gas flow was sufficient to keep PE'CO2 constant for 30 min. The other circuit was then used for an additional 30 min. The required FGF was 54 ml kg-1 min-1 for the Bain system, compared with 67 ml kg-1 min-1 for the ADE system. We conclude that, during controlled ventilation, the ADE system is 25% less efficient than the Bain system.\r"

There were no significant differences between the two breathing systems at fresh gas flow rates of approximately 50 and 70 ml kg-1 min-1. Inspired carbon dioxide concentrations increased in one of six subjects at the higher fresh gas flow rate using the Magill system and in two using the Lack system. Inspired carbon dioxide concentration did not increase in only one of six subjects at the lower fresh gas flow rate with both systems. Expired carbon dioxide concentrations and expired minute volume increased in the majority of subjects at both fresh gas flow rates using each system. We conclude that a fresh gas flow rate greater than 70 ml kg-1 min-1 (which approximated to alveolar minute volume in our subjects) should be supplied to the Magill and Lack breathing systems.\r"

  ".U": "89167132\r", 
  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To determine the relative risk of developing endometrial neoplasia after treatment with oestrogens alone or in conjunction with progestogens. DESIGN--Prospective cohort follow up study, average observation period 5.7 years for each patient. To have a 90% chance of detecting a relative risk of 2.0 with 95% significance the study required 78,000 person years of observation. SETTING--Community based cohort. PATIENTS--Women aged over 35 who were prescribed non-contraceptive oestrogens in the Uppsala health care region during April 1977 to March 1980 were identified from pharmacy records. Of all prescriptions issued, 95% were identified. Patients from the cohort who developed endometrial neoplasia were identified from the cancer registry of the Uppsala health care region. Compliance, sociodemographic data, and lifetime exposures to oestrogen and cyclically added progestogen were assessed by questionnaire in a sample of the cohort. The final cohort consisted of 23,244 patients (133,373 person years). The prevalence of university education, oophorectomy, and hysterectomy was higher in the cohort than the general population; no other confounding factors were identified. MEASUREMENTS--The total number of person years was divided into exposure groups by inference from the data from the questionnaire. Compensation was made for the excess of hysterectomies. Specimens from all cases of endometrial neoplasia in the cohort and 90% of cases in the general population were studied blind histopathologically. Characteristics of treatment of all women who had endometrial neoplasia were assessed by questionnaire. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS--Seventy four cases of carcinoma and 33 cases of premalignant lesions occurred in the cohort. The relative risk of endometrial carcinoma was 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.2) after exposure to any oestrogen compound without progestogen for more than six years; 2.2 (1.2 to 4.4) after more than three years' exposure to conjugated oestrogens without progestogen; and 2.7 (1.4 to 5.1) after more than three years' exposure to oestradiol compounds without progestogen. When carcinoma and premalignant lesions were considered together the results were similar but the relative risk was higher. Risk of carcinoma did not increase when progestogens were cyclically added to oestrogens for the entire treatment period (relative risk 0.9 (0.4 to 2.0]. CONCLUSIONS--Use of oestrogens without progestogens is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of endometrial neoplasia. Use of progestogens either removes this increased risk or delays its onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

All patients were seen during seven years and were treated by active initial and maintenance sclerotherapy. Alcoholic cirrhosis was commoner in younger patients (68 (47%) v 12 (20%] and cryptogenic cirrhosis commoner in older patients (21 (34%) v 19 (13%]. Mortality due to the first bleed was dependent on the severity of liver disease and was unrelated to age. Survival corrected for age (life table analysis) was 65% at one year and 60% at two years for both groups of patients. It is concluded that patients should not be denied active treatment for bleeding varices on the basis of age alone. In order to obtain optimum results early endoscopy and sclerotherapy is essential.\r"

Biopsy specimens from 49 women with renal allografts and 69 non-immunosuppressed controls (with no history of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, vulval warts, or abnormal results of cervical smear tests) were assessed for colposcopic appearance, cytological and histological diagnosis, and the presence of human papillomavirus types 6/11 and 16/18 DNA sequences. At colposcopy 26 (53%) of the women with allografts had cervical abnormalities compared with 20 (29%) of the controls. The prevalence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia was significantly higher in the women with allografts (24 (49%) compared with 7 (10%]. The overall rate of detection of human papillomavirus DNA did not differ significantly between the two groups. There was however, a significant difference in the rate of detection of human papillomavirus type 16/18 DNA (27% in the women with allografts and 6% in the controls). These data confirm that pathological and virological changes affecting the cervix are significantly increased in immunosuppressed women and emphasise the need for regular colposcopic examination.\r"

  ".W": "Nineteen patients presenting with late renal failure due to prostatic outflow obstruction (mean age 68.7 years; mean serum creatinine concentration 1158 mumol/l) were identified from the admission records of two renal units. As late renal failure secondary to prostatic enlargement is preventable case records were analysed retrospectively in an attempt to identify aspects of management in which preventive efforts might be of value. Delays in referral were common, with a mean of 2.8 years between the onset of prostatic symptoms and time of referral, six patients being referred who had had symptoms for more than three years. Four of five patients who had had a prostatectomy were known to be in renal failure at the time of operation but were not referred until 2-13 years later, when prostatic symptoms had recurred and there was evidence of progressive nephropathy with dilatation of the upper urinary tract. Two patients died on admission and eight (47% of survivors) required long term dialysis, most patients (80%) requiring some dialysis support during the initial period. These findings suggest that progressive nephropathy caused by prostatic outflow obstruction might, in part, be averted by more adequate screening of renal function in men with untreated prostatism and closer follow up of patients with uraemia at the time of prostatectomy.\r"

Smoking (adjusted relative risk 1.7 for light smokers and 4.3 for heavy smokers), hypertension (2.4), toxaemia of pregnancy (2.8), and diabetes mellitus (6.9) were associated with a significantly increased risk of myocardial infarction. There was no significant trend of risk with social class. Current use of the pill increased the risk only among women who also smoked (relative risk 20.8 for heavy smokers). Previous use of the pill did not influence the risk of myocardial infarction. If heavy smokers also had a history of toxaemia of pregnancy their risk of myocardial infarction was further increased (relative risk 41.0). Other variables associated solely with women, such as parity, hysterectomy, and hormone replacement therapy, had little effect on the risk of having a myocardial infarction. Overall, smoking was the most important independent risk factor and had a strong influence on risks associated with other factors.\r"

It was intended to estimate the unmet need for neonatal medical care and to find out what happens after an attempt to transfer a pregnant woman or a baby has been unsuccessful. A total of 3734 attempts had been made, of which 1646 were for in utero cases and 2088 were for postnatal cases. Nationally, about 9% of attempts to transfer (331) were unsuccessful. In most regions a high proportion of attempts that were eventually successful had taken a considerable amount of time to arrange. It is concluded that despite a twofold increase since 1980 in the number of cots available for neonatal intensive care, arrangements for such provision in the UK are not adequate to meet every request for transfer. No health region in England or country in the UK was able to meet every request immediately, and some regions had great difficulties in arranging even those transfers that had been accepted. Such delays in transfer may lead to appreciable extra morbidity and considerable costs in future.\r"

  ".W": "To assess whether the spread of infection with HIV can be reduced by changes in behaviour among groups most at risk because of their sexual practices sexual behaviour was monitored among 1050 homosexual men tested for HIV infection at a genitourinary medicine clinic in west London from November 1984 to September 1987. Four cohorts, defined by date of presentation, were studied by questionnaire at their presentation, and blood samples were analysed. Between the first and last cohorts there was a considerable fall in the proportion reporting casual relationships (291/329 (88%) v 107/213 (50%] and high risk activities, such as anoreceptive intercourse with casual partners (262/291 (90%) v 74/106 (70%], with the greatest changes occurring before the government information campaign began in 1986. Nevertheless, half of the men in the last cohort studied reported having casual partners. Multiple logistic regression showed that behavioural risk factors for HIV infection most closely resembled those for hepatitis B and that previous sexually transmitted diseases (syphilis, hepatitis B, and anogenital herpes) were themselves independent risk factors. A history of syphilis ranked above anoreceptive intercourse as the strongest predictor of HIV infection. Actively bisexual men showed a much lower prevalence of HIV infection (3/57, 5%) than exclusively homosexual men (113/375, 30%). Sexual behaviour among homosexual men changed during the period studied, and the incidence of HIV infection fell, although more education programmes directed at homosexual men are needed to re-emphasise the dangers of infection.\r"

The cumulative incidence of infection increased from a weighted 2.2% in 1980 to 39.0% in 1987. The estimated yearly incidence of HIV was 3.0% in 1981, rose to 8.8% in 1984, and fell gradually to 0% in 1987. During the study the sexual behaviour of the cohorts was examined. The number of men with whom anopenetrative intercourse was practised fell from a mean of 10.6 to 1.4 for those positive for HIV antibody, whereas the number with whom anoreceptive intercourse was practised fell from a mean of 3.7 to 0.5 for those negative for the antibody. In addition, there was a reduction in the number of cases of hepatitis B and syphilis among men in general. The decline in infection with HIV was assumed to be linked to changes in sexual behaviour. Such changes practised early in the course of the epidemic probably had a strong effect on the number of cases of AIDS among homosexual men in Amsterdam.\r"

Three had multiple admissions to hospital during their sentences with diabetic ketoacidosis that they induced themselves by not taking insulin. The motive seemed to be removal from prison to the fairly pleasant surroundings of the local hospital. A fourth prisoner required admission in a hyperglycaemic, hyperosmolar state that had gone unnoticed as he was thought to be \"acting up.\" The two others had imperfect long term management of diabetes during their sentences. There is clearly room for improvement in diabetic services in British prisons, but manipulative behaviour on the part of some diabetic prisoners may remain a problem.\r"

SETTING--Health centres in Edinburgh and Livingston. PATIENTS--Sixty women identified as depressed by screening at six weeks post partum and by psychiatric interview at about 13 weeks post partum. Five women did not wish to participate, and a further five did not complete the trial. Age, social and obstetric factors, and diagnosis were similar in women who completed the trial and those who withdrew. INTERVENTION--Eight weekly counselling visits by health visitors who had been given a short training in counselling for postnatal depression. END POINT--Reduction of depression. MEASUREMENTS and main results--Standardised psychiatric interviews and a 10 point self report scale were used to identify depression before and after intervention. The psychiatrist was not told to which group women were allocated. After three months 18 (69%) of the 26 women in the treatment group had fully recovered compared with nine (38%) of the 24 in the control group. The difference between the groups was thus 32% (95% confidence interval 5 to 58). CONCLUSIONS--Counselling by health visitors is valuable in managing non-psychotic postnatal depression.\r"

DESIGN--Randomised parallel controlled study of moderate sodium restriction for three months compared with usual diabetic diet, followed by randomised double blind crossover trial of sustained release preparation of sodium for one month versus placebo for one month in patients continuing with sodium restriction. SETTING--Patients attending diabetic outpatient clinic of city hospital. PATIENTS--Thirty four patients with established type II diabetes complicated by mild hypertension (systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mm Hg or diastolic pressure greater than 95 mm Hg on three consecutive occasions). Patients already taking antihypertensive agents (but not diuretics) not barred from study provided that criteria for mild hypertension still met. Conditions precluding patients from study were diabetic or hypertensive nephropathy, cardiac failure, and pregnancy. INTERVENTIONS--After run in phase with recordings at seven weeks, three weeks, and time zero patients were allocated at random to receive moderate dietary sodium restriction for three months (n = 17) or to continue with usual diabetic diet. Subsequently nine patients in sodium restriction group continued with regimen for a further two months, during which they completed a randomised double blind crossover trial of sustained release preparation of sodium (Slow Sodium 80 mmol daily) for one month versus matching placebo for one month. END POINT--Reduction in blood pressure in type II diabetics with mild hypertension. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Supine and erect blood pressure, body weight, and 24 hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion measured monthly during parallel group and double blind crossover studies. After parallel group study sodium restriction group showed significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (supine 19.2 mm Hg, erect 21.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and mean daily urinary sodium excretion (mean reduction 60 mmol/24 h). There were no appreciable changes in weight, diabetic control, or diastolic pressure. No significant changes occurred in controls. In double blind crossover study mean supine systolic blood pressure rose significantly (p less than 0.005) during sodium supplementation (to 171 mm Hg) compared with value after three months of sodium restriction alone (159.9 mm Hg) and after one month of placebo (161.8 mm Hg). CONCLUSIONS--Moderate dietary restriction of sodium has a definite hypotensive effect, which may be useful in mild hypertension of type II diabetes.\r"

Three questionnaires were sent between 1972 and 1985. The use of prophylactic treatment in the group of patients with severe and moderately severe haemophilia increased from 21% (n = 242) in 1972 to 36% (n = 559) in 1985. Home treatment programmes increased from 4% to 53%. Overall mortality was 2.1 times higher than in the general male population, which leads to a calculated life expectancy of 66 years compared with 74 years in the general male population. Severe joint impairment was prominent in the older age groups, reflecting insufficient treatment in the past. A sharp decrease in the use of inpatient and outpatient hospital facilities was observed as well as much less absence from school and work. It is concluded that the high costs of modern substitution treatment are fully justified.\r"

It was found that the procedure most commonly performed was abortion, though this made up only 19% of the total caseload in 1986 compared with 30% in 1981, otherwise the case mix in 1986 was similar to that in 1981. Fewer patients came from overseas in 1986 than in 1981, but the distribution by age and sex remained the same, with three quarters of the patients aged between 15 and 65. The estimated bed occupancy in the independent hospitals in 1986 was less than 60% nationally and only 52% in the Thames regions. It is concluded that in these five years the nature of the independent hospital sector changed little, and in 1986 the activity still consisted largely of routine cold elective surgery for people of working age, and the regional differences in admission rates to independent hospitals were nearly as great as in 1981.\r"

From 1985 Hospital In-Patient Enquiry data it was estimated that a further 36,000 similar elective inpatient treatments were undertaken in NHS pay beds (a decrease of 38%) and 21,000 as day cases. Overall, an estimated 16.7% of all residents of England and Wales who had non-abortion elective surgery as inpatients were treated in the private sector, as were 10.5% of all day cases. An estimated 28% of all total hip joint replacements were done privately, and in both the North West and South West Thames regions the proportion of inpatients treated privately for elective surgery was 31%. It is concluded that mainly for reasons of available manpower private sector activity may not be able to grow much more without arresting or reversing the growth of the NHS, in which case some method of calculating NHS resource allocation which takes account of the local strength of the private sector will be needed.\r"

Lipid peroxide concentrations were significantly higher in patients both with ischaemic heart disease (median 4.37 mumol/l (interquartile range 3.85-5.75 mumol/l); p less than 0.001) and with peripheral arterial disease (median 4.37 mumol/l (3.88-5.21 mumol/l); p less than 0.001) than in controls (median 3.65 mumol/l (interquartile range 3.29-3.89 mumol/l). Overall there was a significant but weak correlation between plasma lipid peroxide and plasma triglyceride concentrations (rs = 0.25; p less than 0.001) but not between plasma lipid peroxide and plasma total cholesterol concentrations. Furthermore, hypertension, obesity, diabetes, smoking, positive family history, and intake of beta blockers and thiazide diuretics were not associated with significant differences in lipid peroxide values. This study provides clinical support to experimental data indicating that peroxidised lipids may be important in atherogenesis and its complications and also suggests that peroxidised lipids may provide an index of the severity of atherosclerosis.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To investigate whether captopril has any effect on microalbuminuria induced by exercise in normotensive diabetic patients with early stage nephropathy. DESIGN--Randomised, double blind, crossover trial. SETTING--Outpatient department. PATIENTS--22 diabetics with stage II nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion rate less than 20 micrograms/min; 15 with type I diabetes and seven with type II), 32 patients with stage III nephropathy (urinary albumin excretion rate 20-200 micrograms/min; 14 with type I diabetes and 18 with type II), and 10 normal subjects. INTERVENTIONS--Four exercise tests on a cycle ergometer: the first two under basal conditions and the third and fourth after subjects had received captopril (two 25 mg doses in 24 hours) or placebo (two tablets in 24 hours). END POINT--Exercised until 90% of maximum heart rate achieved. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Mean urinary excretion one hour after the first two exercise tests was 21 micrograms/min in normal subjects, 101 micrograms/min in diabetic patients with stage II nephropathy, and 333 micrograms/min in those with stage III nephropathy. Similar results were obtained after placebo. After captopril the urinary excretion rate one hour after exercise was significantly decreased in diabetics with stage II (36 micrograms/min) and stage III (107 micrograms/min) disease compared with placebo but not in normal subjects. Systolic and diastolic pressures were similar in the three groups after placebo and captopril had been given. CONCLUSIONS--Captopril significantly reduces microalbuminuria induced by exercise in normotensive diabetics without affecting systemic blood pressure. Captopril may reduce renal intracapillary pressure.\r"

  ".W": "To examine the hypothesis that the pattern of cervical cancer is changing data on women presenting with the disease over 34 years were studied retrospectively. During 1953-86, 2628 women with cervical cancer were referred to a large tertiary referral hospital in Sydney; 418 were aged 35 or less. During the period of review the proportion of young women with the disease increased from under 9% in the 1950s and 1960s to about 25% in the 1970s and 1980s; a similar but less pronounced trend was apparent for the whole of New South Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. The prevalence of less common morphological types of cervical cancer increased throughout the period, particularly in the young. Pelvic lymph node metastases were identified in younger patients with stage Ib and IIa tumours more commonly in the later years of the study, suggesting that the disease was becoming more severe. Overall rates of recurrence improved over time, but an apparent increase in early recurrences was observed in young patients with Ib and IIa tumours and without nodal disease. The results suggest that the clinical and pathological behaviour of cervical cancer changed over the period of review.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the association between stressful life events and the development of cancer the influence of life stress on relapse in operable breast cancer was examined in matched pairs of women in a case-control study. Adverse life events and difficulties occurring during the postoperative disease free interval were recorded in 50 women who had developed their first recurrence of operable breast cancer and during equivalent follow up times in 50 women with operable breast cancer in remission. The cases and controls were matched for the main physical and pathological factors known to be prognostic in breast cancer and sociodemographic variables that influence the frequency of life events and difficulties. Severely threatening life events and difficulties were significantly associated with the first recurrence of breast cancer. The relative risk of relapse associated with severe life events was 5.67 (95% confidence interval 1.57 to 37.20), and the relative risk associated with severe difficulties was 4.75 (1.58 to 19.20). Life events and difficulties not rated as severe were not related to relapse. Experiencing a non-severe life event was associated with a relative risk of 2.0 (0.62 to 7.47), and experiencing a non-severe difficulty was associated with a relative risk of 1.13 (0.38 to 3.35). These results suggest a prognostic association between severe life stressors and recurrence of breast cancer, but a larger prospective study is needed for confirmation.\r"

Although many participants obtained satisfactory results, 8.6% of the results differed by 1.0 mmol/l or more from the target values, and the overall between instrument dispersion of results was 1.3 times that between hospital laboratories. It was found that common sources of error were poor technique and the use of outdated reagent strips. Users of such instruments outside the laboratory need help and advice with training, and guidelines for this are provided. The main recommendations are that users should establish contact with a local clinical chemistry laboratory for training and support and should participate in external quality assessment schemes.\r"

Multiple areas of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium have been described in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. To assess the reliability of this marker 40 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, representing all 25 pedigrees with living affected members in the Northern region's polyposis registry, were examined for hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium. All had multiple lesions, ranging in number from two to over 40. None of the 35 controls had more than two lesions. Ocular examination is valuable for detecting carriers of the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis before their symptoms develop.\r"

The study was carried out with 45 previously characterised isolates from five different outbreaks and with 96 unrelated isolates from a mixed control population. Sixteen different genotypes were produced. Results were obtainable within days, reproducibility was high, and there was good discrimination among different outbreaks. Compared with existing typing systems DNA fingerprinting provides a robust system that may be used rapidly to identify outbreaks of nosocomial candidiasis in laboratories with no specialist skill in typing C albicans.\r"

DESIGN--Blind assessment and subsequent decoding of mixed batch of abdominal radiographs from patients with and without urological symptoms for evidence of spina bifida occulta and comparison of results with those of previous control series. SETTING--Review study among tertiary referrals to an incontinence clinic of a city hospital. PATIENTS--One hundred and thirty eight adults with proved urodynamic abnormalities in whom neurophysiological measurements were available. INTERVENTIONS--None. END POINT--Correlation of neurophysiological abnormalities in lower urinary tract dysfunction with presence and type of spina bifida occulta and level of opening of posterior sacral arcs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--On decoding radiographs those from patients without urological symptoms showed a similar prevalence of spina bifida occulta to that in the control series (631/2707 controls; 23%). By contrast, patients with urological symptoms had a significantly increased prevalence of spina bifida occulta at S1 and S2 and a higher level of opening of posterior sacral arcs. The increased prevalence of the bony defect was particularly striking in men with urgency and instability and in women with stress incontinence. No significant correlation was found between any particular neurophysiological abnormality and the presence of spina bifida. CONCLUSIONS--In patients with dysfunction of the lower urinary tract neurophysiological abnormalities may be associated with congenital dysraphic lesions in the lower lumbar spine and sacrum. There appears to be no direct causal relation between the radiological and neurophysiological abnormalities but the findings suggest a common aetiological factor.\r"

DESIGN--Prospective longitudinal trial of patients with Graves' disease followed up for 24 months after withdrawal of treatment. SETTING--Tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS--A total of 64 consecutive patients with untreated Graves' disease, eight of whom were subsequently excluded. Fifty six patients completed the study. INTERVENTIONS--All patients were treated initially with carbimazole 40 mg, then with decreasing doses that maintained a euthyroid state. Treatment was scheduled to continue for 18 months but was withdrawn earlier if serum thyroid stimulating antibody became undetectable. END POINT--Serum values of thyroid stimulating antibody (assayed by stimulation of human thyroid cells in vitro) and thyroid hormones and thyroid state every three months during treatment and afterwards every six months for 24 months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--In 44 patients serum thyroid stimulating antibody became undetectable during treatment and treatment was withdrawn (median duration of treatment nine months, range 3-18 months). In 12 patients the antibody could be detected during 18 months of treatment. Among the first group of 44 patients initial values of the antibody before treatment were significantly lower than in the second group of 12 patients (median 225% (range 138-1236%) v 570% (250-1480%), p less than 0.001); the incidence of relapse was also lower (41% v 92%, p less than 0.001); and among those who did relapse the disease free interval after treatment was longer (median 12 months v 1 month, p less than 0.001). Moreover, the initial median serum values of thyroid stimulating antibodies were not related to the occurrence of relapse or remission as these did not differ between patients who did and did not have a relapse (median 267% (range 139-1480%) v 220% (range 138-1236%). CONCLUSION--Monitoring of serum thyroid stimulating antibody was a good guide to the duration of treatment as it allowed the treatment period to be considerably shortened in a large group of patients with no loss of efficiency.\r"

DESIGN--Multivariate analysis of large database of general practitioners compiled from results of confidential questionnaire survey. Data obtained on independent variables of job stress, demographic factors, and personality. Dependent variables were mental health, job satisfaction, alcohol consumption, and smoking. SETTING--National sample of general practitioners studied by university department of organisational psychology. SUBJECTS--One thousand eight hundred seventeen general practitioners selected at random by 20 family practitioner committees in England. INTERVENTIONS--None. END POINT--Determination of the combination of independent variables that were predictive of mental health and job satisfaction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS--Women general practitioners both had job satisfaction and showed positive signs of mental wellbeing in contrast with other normative groups. Conversely, male doctors showed significantly higher anxiety scores than the norms, had less job satisfaction, and drank more alcohol than their women counterparts. Multivariate analysis disclosed four job stressors that were predictive of high levels of job dissatisfaction and lack of mental wellbeing; these were demands of the job and patients' expectations, interference with family life, constant interruptions at work and home, and practice administration. CONCLUSIONS--There may be substantial benefit in providing a counselling service for general practitioners and other health care workers who suffer psychological pressure from their work.\r"

In 1987 a mobile surgery was used to provide primary health care at two sites in central London where many single homeless people sleep outdoors. One hundred and forty six patients were seen with illnesses ranging from scabies to osteomyelitis and tuberculosis. Sociodemographic data showed the patients to be generally an isolated group with deprived and unstable backgrounds, often compounded by alcohol abuse. Over a third of the patients from one site attended a drop in surgery for homeless people in Soho within a month after seeing a doctor in the mobile surgery. This suggests that the project can be a first step in integrating this isolated group with health care facilities.\r"
