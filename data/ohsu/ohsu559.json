In contrast, gastrectomy or extirpation of the acid-producing part of the stomach prevented the hypocalcemic effect, suggesting the involvement of the proximal stomach in the gastrin-evoked lowering of blood calcium. The drop in blood calcium upon injection of gastrin-17 did not reflect a loss of calcium via the gastric juice or via the urine. Extracts of the acid-producing mucosa of the rat stomach had a hypocalcemic effect. The extracts were purified by gel chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Digestion with leucine aminopeptidase destroyed the hypocalcemic activity, while trypsin had no effect, suggesting a peptide (or peptides) with an unprotected NH2 terminus and without basic amino acid residues (or with protected basic amino acids). Both gastrin-17 and the mucosal extract stimulated the uptake of 45Ca into bone (radius and sternum). Gastrin-17 was without effect in rats that had undergone gastrectomy, while the mucosal extract was equally effective in gastrectomized and unoperated rats. We suggest that the effects of gastrin-17 on blood calcium and on calcium transfer into bone are indirect and that gastrin-17 stimulates the release of a peptide hormone, tentatively named gastrocalcin, from the acid-producing mucosa of the stomach. Gastrocalcin stimulates the uptake of 45Ca into bone, thereby causing hypocalcemia.\r"

TF mRNA and protein were absent from endothelial cells lining normal internal mammary artery and saphenous vein samples. In normal vessels TF was found to be synthesized in scattered cells present in the tunica media as well as fibroblast-like adventitial cells surrounding vessels. Atherosclerotic plaques contained many cells synthesizing TF mRNA and protein. Macrophages present as foam cells and monocytes adjacent to the cholesterol clefts contained TF mRNA and protein, as did mesenchymal-appearing intimal cells. Significant TF protein staining was found deposited in the extracellular matrix surrounding mRNA-positive cells adjacent to the cholesterol clefts and within the necrotic cores. These results suggest that deposition of TF protein in the matrix of the necrotic core of the atherosclerotic plaque may contribute to the hyperthrombotic state of human atherosclerotic vessels.\r"

  ".W": "GLQ223 is a highly purified, formulated preparation of trichosanthin, a 26-kDa plant-derived ribosome-inactivating protein with potent inhibitory activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro. The compound produced concentration-dependent inhibition of HIV replication in acutely infected cultures of T-lymphoblastoid cells (VB cell line). Treatment with GLQ223 selectively reduced levels of detectable viral proteins compared to total cellular protein synthesis and produced a selective decrease in levels of viral RNA relative to total cellular RNA in acutely infected cells. Substantial inhibition of viral replication was observed at concentrations of GLQ223 that showed little inhibition of parallel uninfected cultures. Selective anti-HIV activity was also observed in cultures of primary monocyte/macrophages chronically infected with HIV in vitro. When freshly drawn blood samples from HIV-infected patients were treated with a single 3-hr exposure to GLQ223. HIV replication was blocked for at least 5 days in subsequently cultured monocyte/macrophages, without further treatment. The anti-HIV activity of GLQ223 in both acutely and chronically infected cells and its activity in cells of both lymphoid and mononuclear phagocytic lineage make it an interesting candidate as a potential therapeutic agent in HIV infection and AIDS.\r"

Loss of constitutional heterozygosity at one or more of these loci was observed in 8 of the 24 tumors displaying astrocytic differentiation and in the single primitive neuroectodermal tumor examined. The astrocytomas showing these losses included examples of each adult malignancy grade of the disease, including glioblastoma (malignancy grade IV), and seven of them demonstrated concurrent maintenance of heterozygosity for at least one chromosome 17 locus. Determination of allele dosage together with the genotypic data indicated that the tumor chromosomes 17 were derived by mitotic recombination in 7 of the 9 cases with shared homozygosity of the region 17p11.2-pter in all cases. In contrast, tumors of oligodendrocytic, ependymal, or mixed cellular differentiation did not exhibit loss of alleles at any of the loci examined. These data suggest that the somatic attainment of homozygosity for loci on chromosome 17p is frequently associated with the oncogenesis of central nervous system tumors, particularly those showing solely astrocytic differentiation, and that mitotic recombination mapping is a useful approach towards the subregional localization of a locus whose rearrangement is involved in this disease.\r"

To facilitate the analysis of the Sl mutation, we attempted to establish an in vitro system in which the in vivo defect of Sl/Sld mice could be reproduced. 3T3 cell lines were established from 17-day-old embryos of Sl/Sld and congenic +/+ genotypes and were cocultured with mast cells obtained in vitro from the bone marrow of +/+ mice. All eight 3T3 cell lines derived from +/+ of T-cell-derived growth factors. By contrast, none of eight 3T3 cell lines from Sl/Sld embryos supported mast cells under similar conditions. The defect in Sl/Sld 3T3 cells was further characterized as a failure to induce the G1-to-S transition in synchronized mast cells upon contact, suggesting that the Sl gene product is indispensable for this activity. When 3T3 cells of +/+ genotype, grown on pieces of cellulose acetate membrane, were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of Sl/Sld mice, mast cells appeared locally in the transplanted 3T3 cell layers. These results suggested an essential role of fibroblasts in vivo as the tissue microenvironment promoting the development of mast cells and that they are defective in Sl/Sld mice. The present coculture system duplicated mast-cell deficiency of Sl/Sld mice in vitro and should prove useful for analysis of the Sl gene product.\r"

The IGF-II gene was expressed at a high level in fetal rat hind limb muscles prior to the developmental formation of synapses and increased while polyneuronal innervation accumulated. Thereafter, there was a selective down-regulation of IGF-II mRNAs that was exactly coincident with the postnatal time course for elimination of superfluous synapses. The hypothesis that innervation might provide a signal suppressing IGF-II gene expression was tested. Upon transection of the sciatic nerve, there was up-regulation of IGF-II mRNA content in muscle. This up-regulation was selective and correlated with the capacity of denervated muscle to accept reinnervation. These results suggest that the IGF-II gene may play a role in the development and turnover of synapses.\r"

Although linolenic acid [18:3 omega 3; 18:3(9, 12, 15)] is the major omega 3 fatty acid of mouse dams' milk, 22:6 is the prevalent omega 3 fatty acid in serum and tissues. Intraperitoneal injection of [1-14C]18:3 into 3-day-old mouse pups resulted in liver and serum lipid labeling that was initially high, followed by a rapid decline. In contrast, labeling of brain and retinal lipids were initially low and increased with time. Labeled 22:6 first appeared in liver 2 hr after injection and later in brain and retina. We suggest that 22:6 synthesized from 18:3 by the liver is secreted into the bloodstream in lipoproteins, taken up by brain and retina, and incorporated into cell membranes. We hypothesize that the 22:6 requirements of membranes (e.g., during synaptogenesis, photoreceptor membrane biogenesis, or repair after ischemic injury or neurodegenerative disorders) are met by a signal that is sent by the appropriate tissues to the liver to evoke the secretion of 22:6-containing lipoproteins.\r"

Previous studies have indicated that this neuron may play a role in water balance and possibly renovascular functions. A peptidic factor contained in the neuron R15 has been shown to increase the water content of Aplysia. To determine the structure of the peptides contained in R15, we purified the extracts of 820 R15 cells by means of two steps of reverse-phase HPLC. The purification yielded a number of peptides, only one of which, R15 alpha 1, resulted in water uptake when injected into animals. Determination of the amino acid content and sequence analysis of the R15 alpha 1 peptide demonstrated that this peptide contains 38 residues, including two cysteines. The peptide failed to react with iodoacetate, indicating that the two cysteines are connected by a disulfide bridge. To confirm the assigned structure, the peptide was synthesized with a disulfide bridge. The chromatographic properties and bioactivity of the synthetic material were identical to those of the native peptide. Several other R15 peptides were inactive in the bioassay for water uptake. The sequence of one of these peptides (R15 beta) was determined, and it was established that the peptide contains 28 residues. Amino acid analysis of three other peaks was performed. One of these peaks contained a peptide (R15 beta f) whose amino acid composition suggests that it is a fragment of the R15 beta peptide. The other two peaks contained peptides with identical amino acid compositions, suggesting that they are variants of a single peptide (R15 gamma). The amino acid sequences of all the peptides identified in neuron R15 correspond to stretches of a polyprotein encoded by a recently sequenced R15 cDNA.\r"

However, noninnervated cells in culture also express clusters of AcChoR. Both in vivo and in vitro the AcChoR clusters appear to be associated with clusters of nuclei. We have used in situ hybridization to determine whether all the nuclei in cultured chicken embryo myotubes are equally active in expressing the AcChoR alpha subunit message. Cells were hybridized with 35S-labeled probes that contained either both an exon and an intron region or only exon sequences. Control cultures were hybridized with a labeled actin DNA probe or poly(U). The hybrids were detected by emulsion autoradiography; simultaneously, the nuclei were visualized with bisbenzamide. Cells hybridized with the intron/exon probe showed a striking preferential silver grain localization in and around some of the myotube nuclei, whereas those hybridized with the exon probe gave a rather homogeneous grain distribution in the cytoplasm. These results show that myotube nuclei possess differential activation capacities for the expression of AcChoR alpha subunit mRNA and that this difference is due to differential rates of transcription.\r"

  ".W": "The mechanism of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in skeletal muscle is not yet well established. Cultured mouse skeletal muscle cells have been used to study the relationships between triad formation, Ca2+ channel activities, and contractions. The ontogenesis of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and their localization in relation to the ability of muscle to contract and the ultrastructural organization of sarcomeres and triads have been investigated by using an electrophysiological approach together with an electron microscope study. At an early stage of development, both fast (Ifast) and slow (Islow) types of Ca2+ channels are found at the surface membrane. At later stages of development, fast Ca2+ channels remain at the surface membrane, while slow Ca2+ channels migrate to the transverse-tubule membrane. The voltage dependence of fast Ca2+ channels compared to the voltage dependence of contraction clearly shows that these Ca2+ channels have no direct role in E-C coupling. Detubulation at all stages of development has confirmed that T tubules contain essential elements for E-C coupling. However, this work also shows that Ca2+ flowing through slow Ca2+ channels situated in the T-tubular system is not important for contraction. Myotubes lacking slow Ca2+ channels or having no slow Ca2+ channel transport activity (jumps to high membrane potentials, no external Ca2+, block of Islow by Co2+) still retain contraction.\r"

The membrane-permeant cAMP analog N6,O2'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate inhibited muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake into rat cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 1.3 mM). The inhibition was due to a decrease in the maximal effect of muscimol, with no change in potency. Similar effects were observed with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, and the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine. The effect of endogenous cAMP accumulation on the gamma-aminobutyric acid-gated Cl- channel was studied with forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase. Under identical conditions, in the intact synaptoneurosomes, forskolin inhibited muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake and generated cAMP with similar potencies (IC50 = 14.3 microM; EC50 = 6.2 microM, respectively). Surprisingly, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, which does not activate adenylate cyclase, also inhibited the muscimol response, suggesting that forskolin and its lipophilic derivatives may interact with the Cl- channel directly. Indeed, forskolin inhibition of muscimol-induced 36Cl- uptake was extremely rapid (within 5 sec), preceding the accumulation of sufficient levels of cAMP. After 5 min, a slower phase of inhibition was seen, similar to the time course for cAMP accumulation. The data suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor function in brain can be regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation.\r"

Exposure of the cells to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin alone was much less effective and, in the presence of 3-MC, did not alter the sensitivity (EC50 = 0.3 microM) or extent of growth inhibition by the latter. The degree of 3-MC-mediated inhibition, however, was markedly alleviated by inclusion of retinoic acid (EC50 greater than or equal to 0.7 microM) and hydrocortisone (EC50 = 40 nM) or dexamethasone (EC50 = 3 nM) in the culture medium. These physiological effectors, which are known to have opposing actions on keratinocyte character in SCC cells, did not significantly alter either aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity or macromolecular adduct formation. Further analysis of the cellular responses indicated that hydrocortisone and, in some experiments, retinoids increased the growth rate in 3-MC-exposed cultures, while 3-MC increased the saturation density in retinoic acid-exposed cultures, an example of interference with a physiological response of the cells. These results indicate that alteration of the differentiated state, regardless of the direction of the change, can alter the sensitivity of the cells to toxic stimuli. Further investigation of the bases of such toxic responses and their modulation by the microenvironment may enhance our understanding of the target cell specificity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.\r"

  ".W": "The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the contractile protein myosin play an important role in myocardial performance. Both of these systems exhibit plasticity--i.e., quantitative and/or qualitative reorganization during development and in response to stress. Recent studies indicate that SR Ca2+ uptake function is altered in adaptive cardiac hypertrophy and failure. The molecular basis (genetic and phenotypic) for these changes is not understood. In an effort to determine the underlying causes of these changes, we characterized the rabbit cardiac Ca2+-ATPase phenotype by molecular cloning and ribonuclease A mapping analysis. Our results show that the heart muscle expresses only the slow-twitch SR Ca2+-ATPase isoform. Second, we quantitated the steady-state mRNA levels of two major SR Ca2+ regulatory proteins, the Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban, to see whether changes in mRNA content might provide insight into the basis for functional modification in the SR of hypertrophied hearts. In response to pressure overload hypertrophy, the relative level of the slow-twitch/cardiac SR Ca2+-ATPase mRNA was decreased to 34% of control at 1 week. The relative Ca2+-ATPase mRNA level increased to 167% of control after 3 days of treatment with thyroid hormone. In contrast, in hypothyroid animals, the relative Ca2+-ATPase mRNA level decreased to 51% of control at 2 weeks. The relative level of phospholamban mRNA was decreased to 36% in 1-week pressure overload. Hyperthyroidism induced a decrease to 61% in the phospholamban mRNA level after 3 days of treatment, while hypothyroidism had virtually no effect on phospholamban mRNA levels. These data indicate that the expression of SR Ca2+-ATPase and phospholamban mRNA may not be coordinately regulated during myocardial adaptation to different physiological conditions.\r"

  ".W": "Cytosolic free magnesium concentration [Mg2+]i and its regulation were studied in cultured embryonic chicken heart cells by use of the fluorescent indicator 2-[2-(5-carboxy)oxazole]-5-hydroxy-6-aminobenzofuran-N,N,O-triacet ic acid (Furaptra). The intracellular location of Furaptra was confirmed by its complete release from cells upon addition of saponin. The basal [Mg2+]i, which averaged 0.48 +/- 0.03 mM (n = 31), increased 3-fold on perfusion with sodium-free solution. This increase could not simply be attributed to intracellular sodium-extracellular magnesium exchange because a similar increase in [Mg2+]i occurred with magnesium-free, sodium-free perfusion. Furthermore, the increase in [Mg2+]i was largely attenuated when calcium was removed from the sodium-free perfusate. Thus, a substantial part of the increase in [Mg2+]i that occurs upon sodium-free perfusion is dependent on an increase in cytosolic free calcium (intracellular sodium-extracellular calcium exchange). The data suggest that [Mg2+]i is altered by calcium, most likely due to a competition for intracellular binding sites.\r"

Inflammatory scars (n = 4), with edema, necrosis, hypercellularity, and loose fibrous tissue, appeared hypointense relative to liver on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Vascular scars (n = 3), predominantly composed of vascular channels traversing collagenous tissue, showed MR features similar to those of inflammatory scars. Collagenous scars (n = 3) appeared hypointense relative to liver on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. Central tumor scars are a frequent but nonspecific feature of both benign and malignant primary liver tumors.\r"

A double-echo short TI IR sequence was implemented to offer different degrees of T1- and T2-dependent image contrast. In 50 consecutive patients with proved liver tumors (30 metastases, 13 hemangiomas, seven other primary liver tumors), images obtained with a double-echo IR sequence at a repetition time (TR) of 1,500 msec, echo time (TE) of 30 and 60 msec, and TI of 80 msec (TR/TE/TI = 1,500/30, 60/80) were compared with those obtained with spin-echo (SE) sequences at a TR of 275 msec and a TE of 14 msec (TR/TE = 275/14) and 2,350/60, 120, 180. Metastases-liver contrast-to-noise ratios were highest at SE 275/14, followed by IR 1,500/30/80 and SE 2,350/180. IR 1,500/30/80 and SE 275/14 sequences consistently showed higher sensitivity for the detection of metastases than T2-weighted SE sequences. Differential diagnosis of benign and malignant lesions was more reliable with T2-weighted SE sequences than T2-weighted short TI IR sequences.\r"

Definite PAI was seen in all patients with obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, and cholangiocellular carcinoma. It was also clearly seen in all four cases of malignant lymphadenopathy in the hepatoduodenal ligament, in one of two cases of acute hepatitis, and in four of 47 cases of liver cirrhosis. However, in patients with bile duct dilatation or with gallstone or pancreatic disease without obstructive jaundice or cholangitis, no definite PAI was seen. Histologic studies of the liver performed in 23 patients with definite PAI showed edema, ductular proliferation, dilatation of lymph vessels, and inflammatory cell infiltration in portal tracts. It is concluded that definite intrahepatic PAI is a useful sign that indicates the presence of biliary or diffuse hepatic disease.\r"

Two images per minute were obtained for 5 minutes, and one per minute thereafter until about 10 minutes. Dynamic MR studies revealed five criteria for differentiating these tumors. With HCC there was a hyperintense mass before contrast material enhancement (32%), peak contrast enhancement at about 10 seconds after injection (55%), slight to moderate peak contrast enhancement (73%), absent or minimal delayed enhancement (100%), and, at morphologic study, a capsule or nodules-in-nodule appearance (59%). With hemangioma there was a hypointense mass before contrast enhancement (72%), peak contrast enhancement more than 2 minutes after injection (72%), marked peak contrast enhancement (83%), moderate to marked delayed enhancement (100%), and, at morphologic study, spreading phenomenon (39%). Seventy-seven percent of HCCs and 83% of hemangiomas satisfied three or more criteria and thus could be differentiated from each other with certainty.\r"

The relatively small proportion of examinations in which no abnormalities were observed, 7%, differs from that in early reports, as does the absence of generalized pancreatic enlargement. Pancreatic ductal dilatation and parenchymal atrophy were notably more prevalent than reported previously. Nine of the 17 patients with focal pancreatic enlargement had calculi within the mass, which suggested benign disease; of the eight other patients, two of whom had coexistent carcinoma, this finding was absent and the masses were considered indeterminate at CT.\r"

Ninety-six breast lesions were aspirated during wire localization with standard mammographic technique. Cytologic results were compared with surgical pathology results. Sixty-one of the 96 aspirates were adequate for diagnosis. Nine were positive for malignant cells; seven, suspicious; 12, atypical; and 33, negative. All lesions demonstrating positive or suspicious cytologic findings were found to be malignant at biopsy; five of the 12 with atypical cytologic findings were malignant. Of 33 lesions deemed negative by means of cytology, two were biopsy-proved carcinomas. Cytologic examination permitted accurate diagnosis of 21 of the 23 (91%) carcinomas in which an adequate sample was obtained. Insufficient cellular material was obtained from 35 lesions, 16 of which showed marked fibrosis at histologic examination. The authors conclude that FNA cytology can aid in establishing a diagnosis in many cases in which nonpalpable breast lesions are detected at mammography.\r"

Fifteen patients with thoracic outlet syndrome had osseous abnormalities (anomalous cervical ribs; abnormally long, drooping C-7 transverse processes) identifiable on plain radiographs. CT did not provide further diagnostic information in the patients with abnormal radiographs. Eight of 12 patients (66%) with normal plain radiographs had abnormal findings on CT scans, consisting of impingement of the C-7 transverse process on the scalene triangle or anteromedial aspect of the middle scalene muscle. Only two of 21 control patients (9.5%) displayed this CT abnormality (P less than .01).

Diaphragmatic defects and pseudotumors, nonexistent in the 3d and 4th decades, increased in number and severity to affect 56% of the patients in the 7th and 8th decades. Neither the status of the skeletal muscle nor the presence of obesity correlated with age or with the presence of diaphragmatic defects. Eighty-four percent of the patients with emphysematous changes demonstrated diaphragmatic defects; thus, a strong association with emphysema was observed. If emphysematous patients are excluded, defects were more common in women. The esophageal hiatus width was found to increase with age.\r"

These techniques yielded images showing small peripheral pulmonary vascular structures. Most subsegmental vessels and sixth- and seventh-order branches could be traced, especially near the coils. GRASS images obtained with dual surface coils and breath holding depicted fifth- and sixth-order branches. Preliminary results indicated that small pulmonary vessels can be imaged with MR with a combination of high-resolution techniques and ECG gating in diastole.

Pulmonary edema accompanying mitral regurgitation should be suspected whenever right upper lobe consolidation develops in a patient with known or suspected mitral valve disease.

MR imaging showed diffuse increased signal in vertebrae and disks on long repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE) images in four patients and focal increased signal with normal disks in one. Epidural extension was best seen on short TR/TE images in four. Tuberculous spondylitis was characterized by predilection for the midthoracic spine (73%), vertebral destruction with gibbus deformity (60%), disk collapse, and paraspinal abscesses (14 of 15). On MR images signal intensity of affected vertebrae was similar to but more severe than findings in patients with brucellar spondylitis. Scintigraphy was the least helpful in differentiating the two infections.

  ".W": "Few reports have described the nature of the appearance of nonacute subdural hematoma on magnetic resonance (MR) images. The authors analyzed MR images in 39 cases of nonacute subdural hematoma and subdural effusion by measuring in vitro proton relaxation times and the biochemical variables of hematoma fluids. T1 became proportionally shorter than T2 with an increase in hematocrit but the direct cause of the variation in T1 and T2 was the amount of methemoglobin. The free iron content, not the bound iron content, was another main cause for shortened T1 and T2. Paradoxical findings in the correlation between the total protein or albumin concentration and relaxation times were noted. It is possible that as the protein level in the supernatant increased, more free iron was bound to the protein, decreasing the influence of the free iron on the relaxation times.\r"

Serial CT was performed in 113 patients; two to four scans were obtained in each patient. Correlation with surgical specimens and clinical presentation is given. In the early, acute stage, focal nonenhancing areas of edema progress to homogeneously enhancing lesions. In the chronic phase, beginning a few months after infestation, nonenhancing cysts are seen, which later demonstrate ring enhancement. Lesions may then completely resolve or may resolve only to appear later as punctate calcifications. This radiologic progression suggests the need to reevaluate current concepts in therapy and diagnosis of this disorder. Studies on therapeutic efficacy should be based on both the improvement of clinical symptoms and evidence of lesion regression at CT.\r"

Three patients had von Hippel-Lindau disease, two of whom had multiple cerebellar hemangioblastomas. Seven hemangioblastomas appeared as solid tumors, six as solid masses with central cysts, and five as cysts with mural nodules. Abnormal tumor vessels, with characteristic signal void, were demonstrated in 13 tumors. Associated hemorrhage was present in four tumors. Although angiography is usually required for the diagnosis and preoperative assessment of this tumor, MR imaging demonstration of a posterior fossa mass with abnormal vessels should suggest the diagnosis of hemangioblastoma. Moreover, the combination of a peripheral posterior fossa cyst with a mural nodule supplied by enlarged vessels may be pathognomonic.\r"

A small steel cap on the end of an optical fiber was fluoroscopically positioned within the aneurysm. The cap was rapidly heated by the optical transmission of laser energy. This produced a thermal tissue reaction within the aneurysm, resulting in its occlusion. After treatment, the steel cap was detached atraumatically from the fiber and left as a permanent implant within the occluded aneurysm. This method has an advantage over the use of a bare-ended intravascular optical fiber because the steel cap provides a uniform distribution of thermal energy, thereby reducing the risk of unexpected perforation during treatment. The radiologic and histologic results of using this laser-catheter system were evaluated 1-21 weeks after treatment.\r"

The results of percutaneous treatment of 17 abscesses with enteric communication in 16 patients without a history of inflammatory bowel disease were reviewed. The long-term cure rate was 71%. Pancreatic involvement in abscess-bowel communication diminished the cure rate to 50% (two of four) and lengthened the duration of drainage required. The results suggest that percutaneous treatment of abscesses with enteric communication is a viable alternative to surgical intervention. Minimal morbidity and no mortality were directly attributable to percutaneous therapy in this series. When the pancreas is involved in the establishment or persistence of the abscess-bowel communication, or when the underlying bowel is diseased, the rate of success decreases.\r"

The initial clinical results could be evaluated in 210 cases; cure or improvement was achieved in 80%. There were 23 cases in which neither technical nor clinical success was achieved. Data on the remaining 187 cases were the basis of this long-term follow-up study. The cumulative patency rate at 5 years was 80% in the atherosclerosis group, 89% in the FMD group, and 74% in the indeterminate group. The mortality was less than 1%. Because spasm occurred in 33 cases, causing an infarction in ten instances, antispasmodic medication seems warranted. These long-term results indicate that PTRA is the treatment of choice in patients with renovascular hypertension.\r"

Counseling by physicians would require approximately 7% of their professional time in a busy radiology department. On a postprocedure test, the patients in groups 1-4 scored on average 38.4%, 68.2%, 63.2%, and 69.8%, respectively. There was no statistical difference in the performance of groups 2-4 on the postprocedure test.

In six women imaged with a 1,000/80 sequence (repetition time msec/echo time msec), signal difference-to-noise ratios (SD/Ns) were higher with a 30 degree flip angle than with a 90 degree angle for urine/fat (mean, 15.2 vs -6.2; P less than .05) and endometrium/myometrium (13.8 vs 9.0, P less than .05). In eight additional examinations, a 1,000/80 sequence with a 30 degree flip angle and two signal averages had less motion artifact (1.2 vs 2.7, P less than .01) than a 2,000/80 sequence with a 90 degree angle and one signal average (4.5 minutes each); SD/Ns were similar. In a third series of experiments, contiguous sections without cross talk, obtained by interleaving two 1,000/100, 30 degrees-flip-angle acquisitions, had better contrast than contiguous sections obtained at 2,400/100 with a 90 degree flip angle (10 minutes each), with SD/Ns of urine/fat of 28.5 versus 16.1 (P less than .01) and SD/Ns of endometrium/myometrium of 15.5 versus 7.8 (P less than .05). Reducing the flip angle can improve examination time, contrast, or motion artifact suppression or eliminate cross talk in T2-weighted spin-echo MR imaging of the pelvis.\r"

In all cases, MR images were correlated with surgical/pathologic findings. Pathologic findings showed that 71 enlarged uteri were due to leiomyoma, including one leiomyosarcoma, and 16 were due to adenomyosis. The other six patients were shown to have an enlarged uterus attributable to simultaneous involvement of both lesions. On T2-weighted images, adenomyosis appeared as an ill-defined, relatively homogeneous low-signal-intensity area embedded with sparse high-intensity spots. In contrast, leiomyomas were well-circumscribed masses with a spectrum of signal intensity. The cause of uterine enlargement was correctly diagnosed with MR images in 92 of the 93 cases. It is concluded that MR imaging is highly accurate in helping to distinguish between adenomyosis and leiomyoma in cases of enlarged uterus.\r"

Gd-DTPA enhancement was combined with the hybrid technique for lipid suppression, which provides water-only images without increasing imaging time or postprocessing. Lesions with high signal intensity due to paramagnetic relaxation enhancement are easily distinguished from low-intensity lipid, which would otherwise dominate T1-weighted images. Preliminary studies were performed to compare Gd-DTPA-CSI images with conventional postcontrast T1-weighted images. In patients examined for orbital, pituitary, and musculoskeletal abnormalities, the Gd-DTPA-CSI technique enabled improved detection and finer anatomic staging of lesions. In theory, a similar result can be achieved by using any chemical shift-selective method that results in true lipid suppression together with paramagnetic contrast agents that generate high signal intensity. This general approach should be applicable to clinical studies in other tissues or organ systems dominated by lipid, including the pelvis, mediastinum, and breast.\r"

The authors present their results with the first two goals in volunteers. MR fluoroscopic image data were acquired with a limited flip angle pulse sequence with reduced repetition times (TRs) and fewer phase encodings used per image. The sequence was applied continuously, and images were formed by updating one set of data with data from the most recently taken measurements. Sample head images were generated with TR/echo times as small as 11/5.5 msec and 48 phase encodings for a total acquisition time of about 500 msec. Images were acquired while the volunteer flexed his head. Artifacts from the motion became less evident on images as progressively shorter acquisition times were used.\r"

This method provides precise determination of velocity with high temporal resolution in a single measurement. Unlike what occurs in phase imaging techniques, flow is displayed directly, eliminating potential errors that result from non-flow-related sources of phase shifts. Manipulation of raw data sets is avoided. Results obtained from a flow phantom, healthy volunteers, and a patient with an aortic aneurysm demonstrate the capability of the technique to track flow at low and high velocities and to differentiate flowing blood from thrombus. Because of its conceptual simplicity, rapidity, and lack of susceptibility to extraneous phase shifts, this technique may prove ideal for in vivo flow measurement and evaluation of flow patterns.\r"

P-31 MR spectra of the liver were acquired with a 2-T whole-body magnetic, both before and after fructose administration, at 2.5-minute intervals over at least 30 minutes. The fructose load caused a significant, linearly dose-dependent accumulation of phosphomonoesters (r = .72, P less than .01) and a decrease in inorganic phosphate (r = .78, P less than .005) and adenosine triphosphate (r = .73, P less than .01).

A two-dimensional fast Fourier transform was applied to 20 regions of interest (64 x 64 pixels) obtained from CT images of six lungs. A qualitative analysis of the spectra and the application of filters in the frequency domain allowed the characterization and removal of reconstruction artifacts. Selective application of a low-pass filter removed these parasitic frequencies and clearly enhanced the quality of the image.\r"

It was determined that $2,401,709 in excess charges and $2,111,753 in excess variable costs were saved in 1985 as a result of having an effective infection control program in place. If a nominal per diem patient fee ($5) were billed to each patient or third-party carrier for preventive services rendered by the infection control team and channeled to infection control for the 196,141 patient-days in 1985, income of $980,705 would have been generated, leaving net income of $812,979 after the deduction of infection control operating costs. In addition, patients, third-party payers, and the hospital would have still saved $1,421,004 in excess charges, or $1,131,048 in excess variable costs, in prevented infections. Infection control programs are extremely cost effective, and if preventive care is to be encouraged, financial incentives for value received for infection control services are needed.\r"

  ".W": "Case notification data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control imply that AIDS has spread rapidly among intravenous drug users in the northeastern United States. These data determine a doubling time for AIDS cases of 5-6 months for this population early in the epidemic. A new mathematical model of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via shared drug injection equipment in \"shooting galleries\" is developed to understand the rapid spread of HIV and AIDS among drug users. The model depends on quantities such as rates of sharing injection equipment, the ratio of addicts to injection equipment in the population, the infectivity of HIV transmitted by shared injection equipment, the likelihood that infectious equipment is \"flushed\" by the blood of an uninfected user, and the duration of needle-sharing activity by HIV-infected addicts. The model is extended to incorporate the impact of cleansing or bleaching of injection equipment. Also, the model is reformulated to account for the inactivation of HIV infectiousness over time. The models demonstrate that policies such as the distribution of cleansing solutions and/or injection equipment among drug addicts could slow or stop the intravenous transmission of HIV in shooting galleries.\r"

Early removal of reproductive tissue primordia causes reproductive Rz cells to develop morphologically like their standard segmental homologs, suggesting that Rz cells depend on peripheral targets for signals that determine their central and peripheral morphology. Furthermore, after removal of reproductive tissue, reproductive Rz cells also receive synaptic inputs normally appropriate for standard Rz cells. These results suggest that the functional identity of these neurons is specified by the target they contact during embryogenesis.\r"

Genes (ets-1, ets-2, and erg) with variable relatedness to the v-ets oncogene of the E26 virus have been identified, cloned, and characterized in several species. Two new members (elk-1 and elk-2) of the ets oncogene superfamily have now been identified. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the elk-1 cDNA clone revealed that this gene encodes a 428-residue protein whose predicted amino acid sequence showed 82% similarity to the 3' region of v-ets. The elk or related sequences appear to be transcriptionally active in testis and lung. The elk cDNA probe detects two loci in the human genome, elk-1 and elk-2, which map to chromosome regions Xp11.2 and 14q32.3, respectively. These loci are near the translocation breakpoint seen in the t(X;18) (p11.2;q11.2), which is characteristic of synovial sarcoma, and the chromosome 14q32 breakpoints seen in ataxia telangiectasia and other T cell malignancies. This suggests the possibility that rearrangements of elk loci may be involved in pathogenesis of certain tumors.\r"

Plasma LDL therefore consists of two populations, one containing apoB derived from the maternal and one from the paternal apoB alleles. Products of the apob gene with high or low affinity for the MB-19 monoclonal antibody can be distinguished, and this antibody was used to identify heterozygotes with allele-specific differences in the amount of apoB in their plasma. A family study confirmed that the unequal expression phenotype was inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and was linked to the apob gene locus. Significant apoB genetic variation affecting plasma LDL levels may be more common than previously appreciated.\r"

In addition, a method was developed to estimate the time course and absolute concentration of odorants delivered to the receptor sites. With this method, olfactory neurons were found to have relatively high stimulus thresholds, steep dose-response relations, long latencies, and an apparent requirement for cooperativity at one or more steps in the pathway from odorant binding to activation of the generator current.\r"

This analysis was termed an allelotype, in analogy with a karyotype. Three major conclusions were drawn from this analysis: (i) Allelic deletions were remarkably common; one of the alleles of each polymorphic marker tested was lost in at least some tumors, and some tumors lost more than half of their parental alleles. (ii) In addition to allelic deletions, new DNA fragments not present in normal tissue were identified in five carcinomas; these new fragments contained repeated sequences of the variable number of tandem repeat type. (iii) Patients with more than the median percentage of allelic deletions had a considerably worse prognosis than did the other patients, although the size and stage of the primary tumors were very similar in the two groups. In addition to its implications concerning the genetic events underlying tumorigenesis, tumor allelotype may provide a molecular tool for improved estimation of prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of intracellular calcium concentration in single smooth muscle cells was investigated by simultaneously monitoring electrical events at the surface membrane and calcium concentration in the cytosol. Cytosolic calcium concentration rose rapidly during an action potential or during a voltage-clamp pulse that elicited calcium current; a train of voltage-clamp pulses caused further increases in the calcium concentration up to a limit of approximately 1 microM. The decline of the calcium concentration back to resting levels occurred at rates that varied with the calcium concentration in an apparently saturable manner. Moreover, the rate of decline at any given calcium concentration was enhanced after a higher, more prolonged increase of calcium. The process responsible for this enhancement persisted for many seconds after the calcium concentration returned to resting levels. Thus, the magnitude and duration of a calcium transient appear to regulate the subsequent calcium removal.\r"

A complementary DNA library was made from rat hippocampus, and a complementary DNA clone (RBK-1) was isolated. The predicted sequence of the 495-amino acid protein is homologous to potassium channel proteins encoded by the Shaker locus of Drosophila and differs by only three amino acids from the expected product of a mouse clone MBK-1. Messenger RNA transcribed from RBK-1 in vitro directed the expression of potassium channels when it was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The potassium current through the expressed channels resembles both the transient (or A) and the delayed rectifier currents reported in mammalian neurons and is sensitive to both 4-aminopyridine and tetraethylammonium.\r"

A survey of 300 first-year and second-year medical students at the Medical College of Georgia showed that 84% of the respondents plan to specialize, yet only 49% recognized general internal medicine as a specialty. Significantly higher percentages of students correctly classified six other specialties. Only family practice was less likely than internal medicine to be recognized as a specialty. Earlier recognition of general internal medicine as a specialty among students who want to specialize might result in an increased number of students entering internal medicine residency programs.\r"

We analyzed admissions, length of stay, diagnostic problems, demographic data on interns, changes in diagnostic and therapeutic options, and number and type of consultations. The intern in 1987 spent less time in the hospital but had more admissions, more interruptions, more clerical responsibilities, and more therapeutic and diagnostic options, and was more dependent on senior colleagues with special expertise. For these reasons the intern in 1987 had less time with individual patients and less autonomy than his 1967 counterpart. Recognition and modification of the negative aspects of medicine interns' experience will increase the attractiveness of internal medicine residencies.\r"

  ".W": "When recently polled, one half of 4,100 physicians believed they had the right not to treat patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 15% said they would actually refuse to care for them. To assure medical care for the 365,000 AIDS patients projected for the US by 1992, it is imperative to know whether there is something unique about AIDS patients that produces aversion among physicians. We hypothesized that the desire to avoid AIDS patients derived from three fears: fear of contagion, homophobia, and a desire to avoid dying patients. To identify the extent to which these three fears affect the attitudes that students hold toward AIDS patients, we conducted three studies. In our first study, we discovered that students' views about a patient with a terminal illness are the same whether the illness is leukemia or AIDS. In the second study, we found that the patient's sexual preference was not the major reason students would avoid an AIDS patients. In a third study, we confirmed that fear of contagion is the principal cause of students' desire to avoid an AIDS patient. In the course of these studies, we found important differences between the attitudes of male and female students. Female students scored lower on the homophobic scale than male students, and they had less antipathy toward AIDS patients. Helping health care professionals understand their fears toward patients with AIDS will in the long run improve medical care. Since the origins of these fears are for the most part well hidden in our unconscious, dissemination of facts alone will not do the job. Interventions are needed to help health care professionals acknowledge and overcome their negative feelings about AIDS.\r"

After exclusion of those in whom menarche occurred after age 16, the overall linear regression equation for the remaining 416 patients, Height = 153.95 + .7353 (Age), was still significant (P not equal to .001), but the coefficient for the quadratic term was not.

On the basis of history, physical examination, and resting electrocardiogram, patients were divided into two groups--those with clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (group 1, n = 21) and those without clinical evidence of coronary artery disease (group 2, n = 28). End points measured were perioperative (30-day) myocardial infarction (MI) rate and death. A definite MI was diagnosed when an abnormally elevated CPK-MB was accompanied by a new electrocardiographic abnormality or a reversal of the normal LDH isoenzyme pattern. A possible MI was diagnosed when an elevated CPK-MB was the only abnormality. In group 1, one definite (4.5%) and two possible (9.5%) MIs occurred. In group 2, there were no definite or possible MIs. All cardiac events were discovered by measurements of cardiac enzymes, since none of the patients had cardiac symptoms. This retrospective study reveals a low incidence of clinically significant cardiac events after resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms, even in patients with clinical evidence of coronary artery disease. Prophylactic coronary artery bypass surgery does not appear to be necessary for most patients needing repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.\r"

The patients with perianal Paget's disease were older, had a higher incidence of invasive cancer, and had a worse prognosis than those with perianal Bowen's disease. The characteristic appearance of these lesions and their failure to respond to conventional therapy should lead the clinician to obtain a biopsy, which readily establishes the diagnosis.

  ".W": "To determine the extent of lymphadenectomy necessary to cure early gastric cancer, the relationship between the frequency of nodal involvements and the extent of the primary invasion was examined in 274 patients with primary cancer of the stomach. We also evaluated the relationship between the number of metastatic lymph nodes, the pattern of metastases to the nodes, and the histologic type of the primary tumor. In early gastric cancer, lymph node metastasis was more frequent in protruded-type cancer with invasion into the submucosa more than 3 cm in diameter and located in the lower third of the stomach, but was limited to the group 1 lymph nodes, which were defined as being anatomically located nearest to the cancer. In cancer invading into the muscularis propria, metastasis to the group 2 or 3 lymph nodes, which were defined as being anatomically located farther from the cancer than group 1, was found. The number of lymph nodes involved and extent of cancer metastasis in these lymph nodes metastasis, differentiated early gastric cancer had more lymph node involvement and wider extent of metastases than undifferentiated cancers. The cancer cells sometimes replaced most of the node and invaded the perinodal fatty tissue, even in early gastric cancer. In addition, it is occasionally difficult to distinguish macroscopically early gastric cancer with submucosal invasion from cancer invaded into the muscle layer. In conclusion, group 1 and 2 lymph nodes, including perinodal fatty tissue, should be removed completely, even in early gastric cancer, except for carcinoma in situ, particularly when the cancer is of the differentiated type.\r"

  ".W": "In this study the role of free radicals, lipid peroxidation, and neutrophil infiltration as mediators of ischemia and reperfusion-induced intestinal mucosal damage were investigated. We used a rat experimental model in which a ligated loop of the distal ileum was subjected to ischemia and reperfusion and the ensuing mucosal damage was assessed by means of lysosomal enzyme release and intestinal permeability measurements. We also determined the mucosal content of malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation product, and the mucosal activity of myeloperoxidase, a neutrophil granulocyte marker. Ischemia and revascularization alone caused increased mucosal permeability to sodium fluorescein, increased N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase release from the mucosa into the lumen, increased malondialdehyde content in the mucosa, and increased myeloperoxidase activity in the mucosa. Intravenous injection of enzymatic antioxidant, superoxide dismutase, together with xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, prevented the malondialdehyde accumulation and caused attenuation of all the other effects of ischemia. Intravenous pretreatment of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (Solu-Cortef), a steroid and also a nonenzymatic antioxidant, prevented not only malondialdehyde accumulation but also neutrophil infiltration and mucosal damage. These data support a concept that neutrophil infiltration is an important element in ischemic mucosal damage. In addition, the blocking of this phenomenon may have clinical significance in attempts to modulate the potential damaging effects of the increased neutrophil infiltration associated with small-intestinal ischemia.\r"

  ".W": "Resuscitation from major trauma or replacement of major operative blood loss frequently results in varying levels of protein depletion and alterations in plasma volume. To assess the importance of these factors on pulmonary and soft tissue transvascular fluid filtration, we compared the effects of hypoproteinemia and plasma volume expansion on the rate of lung and soft tissue transvascular fluid filtration in unanesthetized adult sheep. Ten animals were surgically prepared with chronic lung and soft tissue lymph fistulas. Lung (QL) and soft tissue (Qs) lymph flow rates were used to determine changes in transvascular fluid filtration. Initially, lactated Ringer's solution (LR) was infused to elevate pulmonary arterial wedge pressure of normoproteinemic animals (Norm/LR) 5 mm Hg for 2 1/2 hours. After a plasmapheresis-induced protein depletion of 30% to 35%, similar volume expansions with LR (Hypo/LR) and fresh frozen plasma (Hypo/Plas) were performed. Plasma, lung lymph, and soft tissue lymph oncotic pressures were determined, and transvascular oncotic gradients were calculated. Plasma volume expansion during Hypo/Plas conditions limited (p less than or equal to 0.05, 3 hours after infusion) Qs elevations compared with Hypo/LR expansion. However, there appeared to be no significant advantage with fresh frozen plasma over LR infusion in limiting QL. During fresh frozen plasma infusion, a distinct 10- to 12-hour lag in protein transport into the interstitium was observed in the soft tissue but not the lung microcirculation. The resultant differences in fluid filtration properties were in part the result of significant widening of the oncotic gradient in soft tissue. Plasma protein infusion appeared not to be beneficial over LR in limiting lung transvascular fluid filtration during hypoproteinemic states but significantly decreased soft tissue transvascular fluid flux.\r"

Thromboendarterectomy of the occluded carotid artery resulted in unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates, and long-term patency of the internal carotid artery was rarely achieved. Carotid endarterectomy on the side opposite the occlusion proved to be successful in relieving nonlateralizing symptoms of cerebral ischemia, whereas results were less encouraging in patients with focal symptoms in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion. External carotid artery reconstruction on the side of the occlusion was successful in relieving focal symptoms. Surgical treatment in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery occlusion should be planned in each patient on the basis of symptoms and anatomic pattern.\r"

We studied the effect of inhibiting thromboxane synthetase, using dazmegrel, on postburn hemodynamic stability and edema formation, the latter monitored by burn tissue lymph flow. Dazmegrel (3.4 mg/kg) was given to six anesthetized sheep, and a 40% of total-body-surface third-degree burn was produced. Lactated Ringer's solution was infused at a rate to restore filling pressures during a 12-hour study period. Data were compared to burn alone (n = 8), anesthesia alone (n = 6), and dazmegrel alone (n = 5) groups. The latter two groups showed no physiologic changes. Dazmegrel pretreatment prevented increased thromboxane A2, measured as thromboxane B2, but resulted in a significant increase in plasma prostacyclin, measured as 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. In addition, a marked vasodilatation and decrease in systemic vascular resistance were noted, as well as a 30% increase in fluid requirements and an increase in lymph flow compared with burn alone. The increase in prostacyclin more than likely accentuated the burn-induced permeability change. Of interest was that oxygen consumption was better maintained with dazmegrel postburn, even with the relative hypovolemia, indicating that postburn vasoconstriction impairs adequate O2 delivery to tissues and that thromboxane synthetase inhibition attenuates this process.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of early graft surface thromboreactivity on long-term arterial polyester (Dacron) graft patency was investigated with separate ex vivo and in vivo animal models. First, parallel, flow-regulated external aortocaval fistulae were created in five pigs with use of paired 8 mm X 35 cm crimped, warp-knitted, low-profile filamentous velour Dacron tubes: one tube preclotted with autologous blood, the other autoclaved after being soaked in human albumin. Autologous radiolabeled platelets, red cells, and radiolabeled human fibrinogen were injected at initiation of graft flow, with timed graft samples submitted for isotope gamma well-counting. Flow surface accumulation of radiolabeled blood elements was greater on the preclotted graft limb at-all time intervals studied, greatest after 5 minutes of flow initiation with RBC accumulation on the preclotted limb 5.19 +/- 0.84 (x +/- S.E.), platelet accumulation 5.57 +/- 1.00, and fibrinogen accumulation 1.82 +/- 0.14 times greater than that on the albumin-treated limb. Second, bilateral iliofemoral artery bypass grafts were placed in 12 mongrel dogs using 6 mm X 10 cm externally supported, noncrimped, warp-knitted, low-profile filamentous Dacron tubes. Before implant in each dog, one graft limb was clotted with autologous blood and the other was autoclaved after being soaked in 25% human albumin. Fresh autologous radiolabeled platelets were injected after wound closure in seven of these dogs. Postimplant graft imaging at 24 and 72 hours showed radiolabeled platelet accumulation to be 1.43 +/- 0.21 and 2.05 +/- 0.18 times greater on the preclotted graft limb. Six of 12 preclotted graft limbs and 7 of 12 albumin-treated graft limbs were patent when animals were killed 5 to 6 months after implant (not significant). Heat-denatured albumin-coated Dacron surfaces have a reduced early thromboreactivity but do not appear to greatly potentiate long-term arterial graft patency.\r"

This information may be displayed to demonstrate flow, cross-sectional diameter, or aortic surface anatomy. To test the accuracy of the MRI studies, we compared them at selected points with the transected aorta and with routine aortograms. Relative cross-sectional diameter estimated by MRI was within 15% of measured aortic diameter in 14 of the 18 vessels and enabled correct detection of thrombus in 16. We conclude that MRI may accurately image the diseased abdominal aortic wall. In addition, an angiographic display format may aid in the interpretation of these studies. Although MRI is not likely to replace aortography, it could be used adjunctively to define aortic wall thickness and the presence of thrombus.\r"

To determine whether difference in asthma prevalence is the major factor underlying these differences in mortality, 2053 Auckland children aged 7-10 years (European 1084, Maori 509, Pacific Islander 460) were randomly sampled from school classes in the Auckland Urban Area, and studied by questionnaire (completed by parents) and histamine inhalation challenge to assess the provocative dose of histamine causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20). Maoris had the highest prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms, and Europeans had rates similar to Pacific Islanders. For \"any current wheeze\" for example, the prevalence in Maoris was 22.2% compared with 16.1% and 16.3% in the Europeans and Pacific Islanders. The prevalence of diagnosed asthma was similar in the three groups. When bronchial hyperresponsiveness (defined as a PD20 less than or equal to 7.8 mumol histamine) was considered, Europeans had the highest rates (20%), followed by Maoris (13%), and then Pacific Islanders (8.7%). These differences were not accounted for by differences in socioeconomic status, rates of smoking in the home, age, gender, or height. It is concluded that differences in asthma prevalence do not satisfactorily explain the mortality and admission rate differences, although the higher symptom prevalence in the Maoris could be relevant to the higher mortality rate. Maori and Pacific Island children with symptoms of asthma were less likely to be taking prophylactic medication than European children. It is proposed that differences in management are important factors relevant to the increased mortality and morbidity from asthma in Polynesians.\r"

The chest radiograph was most valuable in diagnosis; the Casoni and Weinberg tests and blood eosinophil counts were found to be diagnostically unreliable. One thousand and seventy seven primary operations were performed. Cystotomy and capitonnage were carried out in 906 patients, 40 of whom also had decortication of the pleura. Other procedures included cystotomy with wedge resection of locally damaged lung (29 patients) and cyst removal with capitonnage by Ugon's method (33) or the Perez-Fontana procedure (8) and with costal resection for osteomyelitis in two cases. More radical surgery was carried out in 99 patients for longstanding infection or severe lung destruction. Postoperative complications occurred in 37 patients (3.5%) and the 30 day mortality rate was 1.7%. It is concluded that a lung conserving surgical operation is the treatment of choice for most patients with pulmonary hydatid disease. In patients with coexisting liver cysts the thoracic transpleural approach allowed the lung and liver cysts to be removed at the same session.\r"

Patients were treated with inhaled salbutamol and beclomethasone dipropionate in an attempt to achieve normal lung function. Each patient had a \"potential normal value,\" which was either the predicted normal or the maximum PEF value achieved by the patient, whichever was the higher. Patients measured PEF at home and if it fell by more than 30% from the potential normal value the dose of beclomethasone was doubled until PEF returned to the potential normal value, then continued at 20 mg/day for the same number of days. If PEF fell to below 150-200 l/min patients were asked to obtain emergency medical assistance. In the 30 patients who completed the trial the six months before and the six months after intervention with the self management plan were compared. There was a substantial improvement in both subjective and objective measurements of asthma severity, with a significant reduction in nights woken, days lost from work, and requirement for oral corticosteroids and a significant increase in baseline lung function. Routine measurement of PEF in association with a self management plan appears to be effective in reducing symptoms of asthma and improving lung function.\r"

Mean (SEM) vital capacity in groups 1 and 2 was reduced to 36% (1.2%) and 45% (2.0%) of preoperative values on the second postoperative day (1.56 and 1.85 1 respectively), with some recovery by day 4 to 56% (1.2%) and 63% (2.1%) of preoperative values. The mean (SEM) arterial oxygen tension was 7.34 (0.13) kPa for group 1 and 7.46 (0.20) kPa for group 2 on day 2, rising to 8.39 (0.13) and 9.01 (0.23) kPa on day 4. Analgesic requirements were greater in the group receiving an internal mammary artery graft. Possible explanations for the differences between the effects of the two grafts include the higher frequency of pleurotomy, the placing of pleural drains, and additional surgical trauma when internal mammary artery grafts are used.\r"

  ".W": "One hundred and three patients with small cell lung carcinoma were stratified according to stage of disease (47 limited disease, 56 extensive disease) and then randomised to receive etoposide 300 mg/m2 alone for two days or a combination (VAC) of vincristine 1 mg/m2, doxorubicin (Adriamycin) 50 mg/m2, and cyclophosphamide 1000 mg/m2. The drugs were given at three week intervals. Patients were assessed after three cycles of treatment and continued with the same regimen if in complete remission and with the alternative regimen if in partial remission; they were withdrawn if the disease had progressed. Twenty four patients (23%) achieved complete remission and this occurred more often when patients were receiving VAC (19 of 82) than etoposide (5 of 75). There was no difference, however, in overall survival between those initially treated with etoposide and those having combination chemotherapy, whether for limited disease (both 8 months) or extensive disease (7 and 5.5 months). Toxicity was less with etoposide. Survival was disappointing, especially with limited disease, even in patients who showed a complete response to treatment.\r"

Twenty-seven patients had adrenocortical adenomas (13 had primary aldosteronism, 12 had Cushing syndrome, and two had nonhyperfunctioning adenoma), one had adrenocortical carcinoma, and eight had pheochromocytomas. The CT values in primary aldosteronism (mean, 1.8 +/- 9.9 H) were lower than those in Cushing syndrome (27.6 +/- 12.0 H) and pheochromocytoma (35.9 +/- 9.8 H). Six adrenocortical adenomas had homogeneous, low CT attenuation, with CT values ranging from -20 to -0.4 H. Four of these had primary aldosteronism, one had Cushing syndrome, and one had nonhyperfunctioning adenoma. Our results suggest that adrenal tumors with homogeneous, slightly negative CT attenuation are likely to be adrenocortical adenomas, mainly primary aldosteronism and nonhyperfunctioning adenomas. This finding may be especially useful in diagnosing nonhyperfunctioning adenoma.\r"

  ".W": "We reviewed 197 body CT studies on 53 sequential patients who had a histologic diagnosis of malignant melanoma in order to determine the CT appearance, pattern of spread, and prevalence of subcutaneous melanoma metastases. Seventeen (38%) of 45 patients with CT evidence of metastatic melanoma had subcutaneous nodules shown on CT. Five patients (11%) had subcutaneous nodules as the only indication of metastatic disease on their CT scans. All patients who developed subcutaneous metastases had primary lesions classified as Clark level IV or V. (The Clark classification is based on the depth of tumor invasion and is rated I to V.) Metastases appeared as small, discrete rounded densities in the subcutaneous fat; lesions were occasionally subtle because of their small size and peripheral location. The location of subcutaneous nodules could not be predicted consistently on the basis of the site of the primary malignancy. We conclude that subcutaneous metastases are common with melanoma in patients with Clark level IV or V lesions. These subcutaneous nodules are readily detected on CT scans if the subcutaneous tissues are carefully examined. The detection of these lesions may affect management or prognosis of patients, especially in those cases where subcutaneous nodules are the only CT evidence of metastatic disease.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-nine patients with 50 fracture nonunions 4-48 months after injury underwent technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) scintigraphy on day 1, combined 99mTc-MDP and indium-111 leukocyte (111In-WBC) scintigraphy on day 2, and gallium-67 (67Ga) scintigraphy on day 3. The results were compared to evaluate the relative abilities of these scintigraphic techniques to detect osteomyelitis. Nine patients had clinical evidence of infection at the time of imaging, and 40 patients (41 fractures) did not. Open-biopsy cultures were performed at all fracture sites and were positive at 21 (42%) of the 50 sites. Combined 99mTc-MDP/111In-WBC images were interpreted with the use of two criteria. A positive study by the first criterion required 111In-WBC localization in the region of the nonunion fracture. A positive study by the second criterion required 111In-WBC localization in bone at the fracture site. The first criterion yielded a sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 72%, and accuracy of 74%; the specificity improved to 97% with an accuracy of 88% when the second criterion was used. Ten (25%) of the 40 patients thought not to have osteomyelitis by clinical criteria at the time of imaging had true-positive 99mTc-MDP/111In-WBC studies by biopsy culture results. Gallium-67 studies were interpreted as nondiagnostic if localization of radioisotope at fracture sites was equal to that with 99mTc-MDP, positive if 67Ga localization was greater than that of 99mTc-MDP, and negative if it was less than that of 99mTc-MDP. Twenty-one 67Ga studies were interpreted as nondiagnostic; 11 (52%) of the 21 had culture-positive fracture sites. The accuracy of 67Ga/99mTc-MDP imaging was 39%. Combined 99mTc-MDP/111In-WBC imaging is useful in the detection of osteomyelitis at fracture nonunion sites and improves the specificity of 111In-WBC imaging by differentiating inflammation/infection in adjacent soft tissue from osteomyelitis at the fracture site. Gallium-67 with 99mTc-MDP imaging is not sufficiently reliable in this clinical setting to be useful as an indicator for osteomyelitis.\r"

CT showed renal parenchymal injuries in 23 patients and ureteral injuries in two patients. Retroperitoneal fluid was detected in 19 (76%) of 25 patients. Perirenal fluid collections were present in all 19, periureteral fluid in 12, interfascial fluid in eight, anterior pararenal fluid in four, and psoas hemorrhage in three. The presence of perirenal and periureteral fluid was not a good predictor of the extent of renal injury. Fluid collections in the interfascial or anterior pararenal spaces and psoas muscle appeared to correlate with the severity of injury. Patients with these fluid patterns usually had renal fractures, arterial injuries, or ureteral disruptions. The presence of perirenal and periureteral fluid did not correlate with the extent of renal injury, while the presence of interfascial, anterior pararenal, and psoas muscle fluid correlated somewhat with renal fractures and renal pedicle disruption.\r"

These features include (1) peripheral edema producing mild hypointensity on short TR/short TE and marked hyperintensity on long TR/intermediate to long TE scans; (2) central necrosis with abscess fluid hypointense relative to white matter and hyperintense relative to CSF on short TR/short TE scans and hyperintense relative to gray matter on long TR/intermediate to long TE scans (the fluid had concentric zones of varying intensity in seven cases, a finding not previously identified in other lesions); (3) extraparenchymal spread (intraventricular or subarachnoid), which was detected more easily on MR than on CT and was manifested by increased intensity relative to normal CSF on both short TR/short TE and long TR/intermediate TE scans; and (4) visualization of the abscess capsule, which was iso- to mildly hyperintense relative to brain on short TR/short TE scans and iso- to hypointense relative to white matter on long TR/intermediate to long TE scans. On the long TR scans, the relative hypointensity of the rim allowed for visualization of the typical morphologic features of the capsule, which in turn aided in differentiation of abscesses from other lesions (as it does on CT). To investigate the cause of the capsular intensity, pathologic studies of the capsules were reviewed when available (10 cases). Fibrosis was identified in all mature abscess capsules, but the combination of the intensities seen on short TR/short TE and long TR/intermediate to long TE scans as well as the temporal changes in intensity were believed to be incompatible with fibrosis as a cause of the capsular changes. Intensity patterns were suggestive of hemorrhage, but neither acute nor chronic hemorrhage was identified on routine H and E stains, while iron stain revealed scant hemorrhage in only two of the eight patients in whom these stains were used. We believe the capsular intensity (in particular the hypointense rims on long TR scans) may reflect paramagnetic T1, and to a greater extent T2, shortening, possibly due to the presence of heterogeneously distributed free radicals that are products of the respiratory burst produced by actively phagocytosing macrophages in the capsule wall. Distinctive MR features of pyogenic abscesses should afford early and accurate diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-eight Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR examinations of the spine were performed in 40 patients referred for MR because of clinically suspected spinal tumor or for further evaluation of an expanded cord. The study group consisted of 32 patients with spinal tumors (seven ependymomas; seven astrocytomas; four hemangioblastomas; two arteriovenous malformations; two unidentified intramedullary neoplasms; four meningiomas; and single cases of metastatic breast carcinoma, cavernous hemangioma with associated hematomyelia, neurinoma, angiolipoma, drop metastasis from medulloblastoma, and epidermoid with diastematomyelia). In the remaining eight patients, other diagnoses were established: thoracic disk herniation (two patients), lumbosacral meningocele (one), syringomyelia secondary to arachnoiditis (four), and expanded cord secondary to gliotic tissue (one). All but two diagnoses were proved histologically by biopsy, surgery, or autopsy; in the two patients with arteriovenous malformations, the definitive diagnosis was made by spinal angiography. Contrast enhancement occurred in 30 of the 32 spinal tumors, and Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1-weighted images proved helpful in defining and outlining intra- and extramedullary spinal neoplasms. All ependymomas and astrocytomas (including low-grade astrocytomas) enhanced. In meningiomas, an immediate and uniform contrast uptake was demonstrated. Additional advantages of Gd-DTPA MR include the differentiation of solid tumor components vs syrinx or cyst or pseudotumoral areas of cord expansion, and the differentiation of residual or recurrent tumor from scar tissue in postoperative patients. Our results suggest that IV-injected Gd-DTPA improves MR sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of spinal lesions.\r"

The procedure involves the use of small pulses of highly concentrated urokinase, which are forcefully sprayed throughout the thrombus during systemic heparinization. Virtually complete lysis was achieved in 46 of 47 occlusions. In the 46 thrombi that lysed, mean time for completion of lysis was 63 +/- 35 min and initial partial return of flow required 26 +/- 18 min. Complications included small peripheral emboli in one treated bypass graft (which cleared promptly after further pulse-spray therapy) and bleeding in three cases (one case of hematoma in the infused field at the site of recent surgery, one case of bilateral hematomas at the femoral puncture site, and one minor delayed self-limited gastrointestinal hemorrhage). Results to date suggest that the pulsed-spray pharmacomechanical method augments the speed, consistency, safety, and cost efficacy of clinical thrombolysis. Further study is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "Report-coding systems allow the radiologist to generate a typewritten radiographic report with a computer. Typically, the report is generated by selecting bar codes, speaking key words, or selecting items on a screen. MAMM REPORT is a report-coding system for mammography, developed by radiologists, that runs on a microcomputer (Amiga, Commodore Co., West Chester, PA). MAMM REPORT speaks questions to the radiologist, who responds by pressing one of two buttons on a computer mouse, thus generating the report. MAMM REPORT allows labeling of digital images and reduction of data required to store the report in computer memory (data compression). Data compression is useful for improving computer operating speed. Digital image labeling and data compression facilitate use of MAMM REPORT on a future digital radiology workstation for an all-digital radiology department. Sixty mammographic reports, reviewed by a radiologist who is not a specialist in mammography, were entered into MAMM REPORT. The mammography specialists who dictated the original reports then judged whether the reports generated by MAMM REPORT would be acceptable replacements on the basis of descriptions of findings, diagnoses, and recommendations for further study. Data compression was measured by calculating the ratio of the number of bytes for storage of the reports in original form to a standard storage form (Huffman encoding) and to the MAMM REPORT coded form. All 60 coded reports were acceptable replacements for the original reports. For computer storage, MAMM REPORT produced a compression ratio of 135 to 1 and Huffman encoding, 1.1 to 1. Huffman encoding did not compress most reports because of their brevity. The results indicate that report coding can produce data compression of radiographic reports. The standard method of text storage, Huffman encoding, is not suitable for application to mammographic reports, which tend to be brief.\r"

Digital images were obtained by digitizing conventional chest radiographs to a 2048 x 2048 matrix with a laser film scanner. Three digital display formats were used: laser-printed digital film, a 2048-line video monitor without user interaction, and a 2048-line video monitor with user interaction. Thirty-one posteroanterior chest radiographs, determined by consensus of four thoracic radiologists to contain septal lines (n = 11), parenchymal nodules (n = 7), nodules and septal lines (n = 7), or neither abnormality (n = 6), were used for the study. Images were interpreted by four radiologists in four separate viewing sessions. Diagnostic accuracy was determined by receiver-operating characteristic analysis for each observer with each viewing technique. No statistical differences in diagnostic accuracy, determined by the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve, were found between the analog film, the digital film, and the two video digital display formats. This preliminary study suggests that 2048-line digital displays may be an acceptable alternative to the traditional lightbox viewing method for the perception of these two abnormalities commonly seen on chest radiographs.\r"

The main organs involved are the liver, central nervous system, kidneys, skeletal muscle, and lungs. Thirty-seven (64%) of 58 patients with leptospirosis, proved by positive serology, had pulmonary radiographic findings. Three radiographic patterns were evident: (1) 21 (57%) of the 37 patients had small nodular densities, (2) six (16%) had large confluent areas of consolidation, and (3) 10 (27%) had diffuse, ill-defined, ground-glass density. Serial radiographs showed a tendency for the nodular pattern to be followed by confluent consolidation and/or ground-glass density. Abnormalities were bilateral, nonlobar in all cases, and had a marked tendency toward peripheral predominance. Pulmonary abnormalities resolved within 15 days, except in eight patients who died because of respiratory failure (six patients) or other causes (two patients). In order to correlate pathology with the radiographic findings, Leptospira, isolated from a patient, was injected intraperitoneally into 20 guinea pigs. All lungs from the guinea pigs showed petecheal hemorrhage, which progressed to large confluent areas of hemorrhage. The typical pulmonary radiographic findings of leptospirosis are compatible with the multifocal pulmonary hemorrhage seen in the guinea pigs.\r"

The patients present with progressive shortness of breath, pneumothorax, chylous effusion, and hemoptysis. Four patients with biopsy-proved lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the lung were evaluated using high-resolution CT. In all patients, the scan showed well-defined cystic air spaces, surrounded by uniformly thin walls, distributed diffusely throughout both lungs. The cystic air spaces ranged in size from a few millimeters to 5 cm. Pathologically, these cysts were predominantly bounded by normal-looking parenchymal components, with occasional patchy involvement by a smooth-muscle proliferative process. The CT appearance of lymphangioleiomyomatosis differs quite distinctly from that of other diseases that can cause cystic air spaces, such as fibrosing alveolitis, neurofibromatosis, and bronchiectasis, and less distinctly from pulmonary emphysema and eosinophilic granuloma. Our experience in these few cases suggests that the high-resolution CT findings in lymphangioleiomyomatosis are characteristic of the disease.\r"

Sedimented calcifications are seen in approximately 4% of symptomatic women undergoing mammography. Their recognition is important to avoid unnecessary workup, follow-up, or biopsy. Key to recognition is the difference in their radiographic features on lateral and craniocaudal views. The classic appearance is that of milk of calcium, seen as linear, curvilinear, or teacup-shaped particles on horizontal-beam lateral views and as ill-defined smudges on vertical-beam craniocaudal views. The most common presentation is multiple, bilateral, scattered and occasionally clustered calcifications within microcysts. Other presentations include milk of calcium within microcysts in a unilateral, clustered distribution; milk of calcium within macrocysts; sandlike calcifications (discrete particles rather than smudges on craniocaudal view) within cysts of various sizes; and rarely, milk of calcium within the lipid cysts of either fat necrosis or galactoceles. None of our cases has proved to be malignant. However, adjacent malignancies are a potential pitfall. We encountered eight patients with carcinoma presenting as clustered microcalcifications in a breast also containing typical sedimented calcifications. In each of these cases, the malignant calcifications could be distinguished by their mammographic appearance. The recognition of sedimented calcifications present in about 4% of symptomatic women undergoing mammography is important because these characteristic calcifications are an indication of benignity. Malignant-appearing microcalcifications found in the vicinity of sedimented calcifications can be distinguished and require biopsy.\r"

In each case, posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were obtained as a routine baseline (not to detect incidental abnormalities) before the patient was scheduled for lithotripsy. Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs were obtained routinely after each lithotripsy session. Seventy-five patients had 107 lithotripsy sessions on a second-generation lithotripter. Sixty had gallbladder stones, five had cystic duct stones, and 10 had common duct stones. All chest radiographs were reviewed by a chest radiologist. No pulmonary or pleural changes occurred after lithotripsy. We conclude that routine pre- and postlithotripsy chest radiographs are not warranted in patients undergoing biliary lithotripsy.\r"

The presence of fistulae and/or sinus tracts was confirmed by contrast-enhanced CT (n = 17) and/or sonography (n = 8), sinography (n = 6), or barium studies (n = 4). In all but three cases the fistulae and extramucosal inflammatory abnormalities were shown by MR. T1-weighted images provided excellent delineation of the extension of the fistulae relative to sphincters and adjacent hollow viscera and showed inflammatory changes in fat planes. T2-weighted images showed fluid collections within the fistulae, localized fluid collections in extraintestinal tissues, and inflammatory changes within muscles. The supralevator and infralevator compartments were well defined on coronal images. Thus, the perirectal spread of fistulae and sinus tracts with respect to the levator ani could be demonstrated in all cases. Our results suggest that MR imaging is useful for the demonstration and evaluation of pelvic and abdominal sinus tracts or fistulae associated with Crohn disease.\r"

It is hypothesized that this increases the potential for sudden unexplained death. Elderly hypertensive patients are at particular risk because of their tendency to have significantly depressed serum magnesium levels, which decrease even further when treated with thiazide diuretics. Potassium supplementation does not effectively restore electrolyte balance unless accompanied by magnesium. Therefore, concomitant administration of potassium and magnesium supplementation appears to be an approach to reducing the risk of arrhythmias and death in thiazide-treated hypertensive patients.\r"

There was 1 death in 3 months in 45 patients with uncomplicated AMI suitable for randomization to activity (group A) compared with 11 deaths in 55 patients unsuitable for rapid early mobilization (group B) (p less than 0.01). Early vigorous mobilization in 24 of the group A patients compared with sedentary care in 20 did not affect change in ejection fraction, end-diastolic volume, end systolic-volume, stroke volume, heart rate or cardiac output between days 4 and 14. A very low risk group suitable for early vigorous mobilization can be defined on day 3 after AMI; further, vigorous early mobilization does not affect left ventricular function or volumes. Early return to physical, social and occupational activity after uncomplicated AMI should result in marked reduction in direct and indirect costs of AMI.\r"

A comparison of type A and B persons showed similar levels of systolic blood pressure, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol and body mass index. Behavioral status also was unrelated to diabetes, cigarette smoking and alcohol intake. Despite similar cardiovascular risk profiles, type A behavior was associated with more than a 2-fold excess risk of angina pectoris, uncomplicated by other symptoms of coronary artery disease (p less than 0.05 for men and p less than 0.01 for women). Type A behavior, however, was not related to an increased risk of myocardial infarction and fatal coronary events. Among the victims of uncomplicated angina, the risk of subsequent coronary morbidity and mortality in both type A and type B men and women increased by more than 4-fold (p less than 0.001). Although the risk was reduced among type A persons, it was not statistically significant. It is concluded that uncomplicated angina pectoris occurs with greater frequency in type A persons than in those who are type B, without explanation by concomitant risk factors. In addition, the prognosis for myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease mortality in angina patients classified as type A is as serious as the prognosis for those who are type B.\r"

The mean +/- standard deviation left ventricular ejection fraction was 30 +/- 12% (range 8 to 65%). Prior trials with 4 +/- 1.2 alternate antiarrhythmic agents had been unsuccessful. Amiodarone was loaded at dosages of 1,200 to 1,800 mg/day, with maintenance dosages of 400 to 600 mg/day. Drug efficacy was evaluated by programmed stimulation at 10 to 14 days in 68 patients. In 38 patients sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation was inducible (group I), whereas 30 patients (group II) had either no inducible VT (8) or had nonsustained VT induced (22). Holter monitoring was used to assess drug efficacy in 18 patients (group III). All patients were evaluated at 3- to 6-month intervals with Holter monitors for efficacy and a standard protocol for toxicity. During a long-term follow-up of 18 +/- 16 months, sudden death occurred in 5 patients and nonfatal arrhythmia recurrences were detected in 16. The actuarial probability of freedom from fatal and nonfatal arrhythmia recurrences at 24 months was 0.52 for group I, 0.97 for group II and 0.68 for group III. The mode of induction, rate change or hemodynamic tolerance of the induced ventricular tachycardia did not predict arrhythmia recurrence. Among the clinical variables analyzed, only an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 30% was identified as a significant predictor of arrhythmia recurrence. Nonsudden cardiac death occurred in 21 patients, including 19 from heart failure and 2 from myocardial infarction. Noncardiac death occurred in 7 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Successful therapy of atrial fibrillation (AF) has been reportedly influenced by a variety of factors including patient age, type of underlying heart disease, duration of arrhythmia, left ventricular function and left atrial (LA) size. To determine which of these factors are associated with maintenance of sinus rhythm after conversion, 43 patients with symptomatic chronic AF in the setting of a dilated left atrium (greater than or equal to 45 mm, range 45 to 78) were followed for at least 6 months after the return of sinus rhythm. Class IA drugs, IC drugs or amiodarone were used for therapy. Life table analysis showed sinus rhythm to be maintained in 81% for 6 months, 79% for 12 months and 60% for 24 months. Factors positively associated with success were conversion with drug therapy alone, duration of chronic AF less than or equal to 1 year, absence of mitral valve disease and LA dimension less than or equal to 60 mm (all p less than 0.05). Patient age, left ventricular function and presence of coronary disease were not associated with outcome. Thus, patients with moderate LA dilatation (45 to 60 mm) and a short duration of chronic AF can often be maintained in sinus rhythm, especially if they convert with pharmacologic intervention alone.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the role of surgery in the management of refractory pediatric dysrhythmias, the investigators' 1987 experience with this therapy was reviewed. Sixteen patients (8 male, 8 female) had surgery. Age ranged from 3 months to 21 years (mean 7.7 years) with 2 being younger than 1 year of age. Eight patients had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), 6 had SVT alone and 2 had ventricular tachycardia. Patient symptoms fell into 3 distinct categories. Nine patients had frequent non-life-threatening tachycardia episodes despite aggressive medical management, 4 patients had life-threatening symptoms either related to frequent tachycardia episodes or due to side effects of drugs and 3 patients had minimal tachycardia symptoms but were judged to be at risk for sudden death. The mechanisms of the tachycardias included reentrant SVT using an accessory atrioventricular connection in 9, the permanent form of junctional reciprocating tachycardia in 2, atrioventricular node reentrant SVT in 2, atrial ectopic focus in 1 and ventricular ectopic foci in 2. Ablation techniques involved either surgical dissection or cryoablation of the arrhythmogenic substrates. There was no surgical mortality and follow-up shows 15 of 16 patients to have had no recurrence of symptomatic tachycardia without any therapy. Based on this experience, management strategies for surgical control of recalcitrant pediatric dysrhythmias are proposed. Surgery for infant dysrhythmias should be performed only for life-threatening symptoms. Beyond the first year of life, after failing 2 medications, surgical options for SVT should be considered. For patients with ventricular tachycardia, aggressive medical management with class II, IC and III agents should be attempted before surgical therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To assess the results of operative therapy for permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia, a type of incessant tachycardia, the clinical and electrophysiologic data of 8 such patients referred for management of tachycardia were reviewed. The duration of incessant tachycardia was 14 +/- 10 years (range 2 to 30). The heart rate at rest during tachycardia ranged from 120 to 150 beats/min. Four of 8 patients had cardiomegaly or depressed ejection fraction (16 +/- 10%, range 5 to 27) at presentation and, of these, 2 had symptoms of congestive heart failure. Exertional dyspnea despite normal left ventricular function was noted in 1 patient, 2 had chronic palpitations and 3 were asymptomatic. Electrophysiologic data confirmed the presence of a posteroseptal pathway with atrioventricular node-like properties conducting slowly in the retrograde direction only. Seven patients underwent successful surgical ablation of the accessory pathway. Hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass was used in 2 and a closed heart technique without cardiopulmonary bypass in the other 5. Three of 4 patients with reduced left ventricular function showed an improvement in ejection fraction to 34 +/- 20% (range 16 to 63) after control of dysrhythmia. Three patients had no evidence of cardiomegaly despite equivalent periods of incessant tachycardia. Another patient with normal left ventricular function despite incessant tachycardia for over 30 years underwent spontaneous remission to sinus rhythm and did not undergo surgery. These data suggest that permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia has a variable presentation and that congestive heart failure is not an infrequent presenting symptom. The substrate is invariably an accessory atrioventricular pathway with a long conduction time and decremental properties conducting only in the retrograde direction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-six standard electrocardiographic criteria for LV hypertrophy were evaluated in 100 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 67 +/- 11 years) with right BBB and technically satisfactory echocardiograms. Eight additional electrocardiographic criteria derived from this study also were evaluated. LV mass index was determined from the echocardiogram using the Penn method. LV hypertrophy defined as LV mass index greater than 132 g/m2 in men and 109 g/m2 in women was present in 56 of the 100 patients. Electrocardiographic criteria with the highest sensitivity were SIII + (R + S) maximal precordial lead greater than or equal to 30 mm (sensitivity 68%), specificity 66%), left axis deviation of -30 degrees to -90 degrees (sensitivity 59%, specificity 71%) and combination of left axis deviation and SIII + (R + S) maximal precordial lead greater than or equal to 30 mm (sensitivity 52%, specificity 84%).

The mean age of the 529 men was 54 +/- 0.58 (SE) years and, of the 390 women, 48 +/- 0.7 years. Mean preoperative diastolic blood pressure was 110 +/- 0.6 mm Hg. The most common causes of renal artery stenosis were atherosclerosis in 647 patients, fibromuscular disease in 161 patients, and renal artery aneurysm in 51 patients. In the remaining 60 patients, other causes were present, including kinks and fibrous bands. The most common surgical procedures were Dacron bypass graft (780 arteries) and endarterectomy with or without a patch graft (329 arteries). Four hundred sixty-nine patients had associated operations, the most common of which were abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy in 231 and aortoiliofemoral reconstruction in 141 patients. The perioperative mortality rate was 5.5% (51 of 919 overall); for renal procedures alone, it was 1.7% (8 of 450) and for combined surgical procedures, 9.2% (43 of 469). The overall graft patency rate at a follow-up of 18.8 +/- 1.9 months was 88.6% (381 of 430) and at a second follow-up of 50 +/- 4.3 months, 86.7% (111 of 128). Analysis of long-term blood pressure response and factors affecting late survival indicated that patients with preoperative diastolic pressures of greater than 100 mm Hg and renal artery stenosis of greater than 70% had the best blood pressure responses and that male sex, increasing age, bilateral renal stenosis, and associated vascular operations lowered the survival rate whereas fibromuscular disease enhanced the duration of survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The subjects were evaluated after 2 weeks of placebo and after 4 months of treatment with enalapril (20 or 40 mg once daily), using M-mode digitized echocardiograms. The drug reduced arterial blood pressure in all patients. Systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly without changes in cardiac output and heart rate. No patient had significant side effects. After treatment LV mass decreased significantly (233 +/- 46 to 204 +/- 37 g, p less than 0.01); the reduction was due to a decrease in septal and posterior wall thickness, without changes in LV diameter. LV systolic function remained unchanged, whereas peak lengthening rate of LV dimension, an index of LV diastolic function, increased significantly (4.05 +/- 1.8 to 5.11 +/- 1.8 s-1, p less than 0.01). After treatment the basal inverse correlation between peak shortening rate and wall stress did not change, the inverse correlation between peak lengthening rate and wall stress became closer and the basal inverse correlation between peak lengthening rate and LV mass disappeared. In conclusion, antihypertensive treatment with enalapril led to a significant regression of LV hypertrophy associated with improvement in LV diastolic performance and no deterioration of LV systolic function.\r"

Of the 151 total patients, 51 (34%) had normal left ventricular systolic function (left ventricular ejection fraction greater than or equal to 55%). Primary valvular disease was present in 4 of these 51 patients (8%), and Doppler echocardiographic evidence of abnormal left ventricular filling (diastolic dysfunction) was evident in 10 (20%). In addition, no predefined resting abnormality was noted in 34 (66%) of them. Despite this finding, 51% of all patients with normal left ventricular systolic function were being treated with digoxin therapy in the absence of atrial arrhythmia. Clinical differentiation of this group of patients from those with abnormal left ventricular systolic function was difficult and may have accounted for this apparently inappropriate treatment. Thus, evaluation of left ventricular function and of causative mechanisms of CHF before initiation of long-term treatment is mandatory.\r"

Doppler echocardiographic AVA correlated closely with AVA calculated by the Gorlin equation at catheterization (r = 0.96). However, Doppler echocardiography slightly but systematically underestimated the AVA (p less than 0.001) and did so most markedly in patients with mild stenosis (greater than 1.0 cm2). In multivariate analysis, the difference in AVA by the 2 techniques was positively associated with left ventricular (LV) stroke volume and inversely with the difference between mean catheterization and Doppler gradients, LV ejection fraction and LV outflow tract velocity. Furthermore, the AVA difference also was related to gender, being larger in women. Thus, overall Doppler echocardiography reliably assesses AVA, but the usefulness of the method is somewhat reduced by its underestimation of AVA in mild stenosis. This drawback, however, is usually overcome by taking patients' symptoms into account. Furthermore, lacking a \"gold standard,\" this underestimation need not imply errors of the Doppler echocardiographic method alone, but also may reflect known inaccuracies of the catheterization technique.\r"

All patients also had angiocardiograms. Two-dimensional echocardiography/color Doppler examination detected all VSDs and correctly categorized the site and extension of VSDs in 50 of 58 (86%). All 40 perimembranous VSDs were diagnosed in the left ventricular outflow tract short-axis plane as an area of discontinuity adjacent to septal tricuspid valve leaflet attachment. Fourteen of 16 VSDs with inlet extension showed initial color flow signals along the septal tricuspid leaflet and along the ventricular septum. Of 23 perimembranous VSDs with outlet extension, 19 had flow signals moving directly toward the right ventricular outflow tract. One perimembranous VSD with trabecular extension showed flow signals directed anterolaterally toward the right ventricular free wall. Eleven of 13 muscular VSDs were similarly categorized correctly by color Doppler as inlet, outlet and trabecular. All 5 doubly committed VSDs were correctly diagnosed as an area of discontinuity adjacent to the pulmonary valve in the short-axis view with flow signals directly moving through VSD into right ventricular outflow and pulmonary artery. Angiography correctly detected all VSDs and correctly classified their site and extension in 45 of 58 (77.5%). It misclassified 8 of 40 perimembranous, 3 of 13 muscular and 2 of 5 doubly committed VSDs. Color Doppler compares favorably with angiocardiography in the detection and localization of VSDs.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased heart rate (HR) variability has been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome after acute myocardial infarction. Presumably, both reduced parasympathetic activity and increased sympathetic activity contribute to this observed HR variability response. To elucidate the physiologic contributions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems to HR variability, the effect of passive head-up tilt (+70 degrees) was investigated on 4 indexes of HR variability in 17 healthy subjects. The standard deviation of the mean of 512 consecutive RR intervals, a traditional marker of HR variability and a purported index of cardiac parasympathetic neural tone, was compared with the mean difference of 512 consecutive RR intervals, with the maximal expiratory RR interval to minimal inspiratory RR interval ratio (respiratory RR ratio) and with the low- and high-frequency components of the power spectrum of 512 consecutive RR intervals. Passive tilt produced a nonsignificant decrease in the standard deviation of RR intervals. There was, however, a highly significant decrease in the mean difference of consecutive RR intervals and the high-frequency component of the RR-interval spectrum. Both the respiratory RR ratio and the low-frequency component of the RR-interval spectrum increased with tilt. It was concluded that the mean difference of consecutive RR intervals and the high-frequency component of the RR-interval spectrum are potentially superior indexes of \"pure\" parasympathetic neural tone and may be preferable for future use in cardiovascular studies of autonomic dysfunction.\r"

The risk of CHD associated with various factors, including total cholesterol, low- and high-density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels, uric acid, blood glucose level, fibrinogen level and hypertensive blood pressure, is discussed with particular reference to the elderly. New data from the Framingham group show that increased left ventricular mass may be a significant risk factor for CHD, particularly among the elderly.\r"

As the United States population grows older, health care costs are expected to grow proportionately unless cost reduction strategies are developed. Cardiovascular disease is ranked as the primary cause of mortality and disability in this age group. It is estimated that 80% of cardiovascular disease in the elderly arises as complications of atherosclerosis. Whereas modern technologic advances--cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, coronary angioplasty, coronary bypass surgery, pacemaker insertion--can help to treat the effects of atherosclerosis, such advances are costly. The most effective cost reduction strategy lies in prevention of atherosclerosis and its complications. A number of studies have linked reduction of risk factors for atherosclerosis to reduction of coronary disease events. However, it is not certain that these data apply directly to the elderly; more research is necessary to develop effective preventive and management strategies.\r"

In other countries, mortality rates have remained unchanged and in some Eastern European countries, mortality rates have increased. In most instances where mortality rates have decreased, the reduction has been observed in both genders and has occurred across a wide age grouping, even in those aged 75 years and older.

Monthly water aluminum levels never exceeded 15 micrograms/L; therefore, the major source of aluminum in these patients was oral phosphate binders. Unstimulated plasma aluminum levels ranged from 7 to 392 micrograms/L, averaged 81.5 +/- 56.4, and did not correlate with the duration of dialysis (r = 0.07; P greater than 0.31) or frequency of symptoms. Stimulated plasma aluminum levels increased in a linear fashion (r = 0.57; P less than 0.0001) with time on dialysis; however, there was no statistical association between the stimulated aluminum levels and a variety of nonspecific musculoskeletal or CNS symptoms, evidence of hyperparathyroidism, hematocrit, or calcium or phosphorus levels. These findings suggest that total body aluminum, as reflected in deferoxamine-stimulated serum aluminum levels, increases as a function of time undergoing dialysis.\r"

In a second group of chronically uninephrectomized females, the effects of multiple (five) consecutive pregnancies and lactations were investigated and did not indicate any severe deleterious long-term effects of pregnancy on the glomeruli in this model of underlying renal compromise. Variable responses to an acute intravenous glycine challenge which did not correlate well with the extent of glomerular damage were observed in each group, suggesting that this test may not always be informative regarding underlying glomerular disease.\r"

Loss of fluid removal capacity was found in all of them. In three, this loss was associated with an increase in peritoneal absorption of glucose from the dialysate and an increase in the transperitoneal transport rates of low-molecular-weight solutes and proteins. In the other patient a decrease in all these parameters was found. This seems to imply that the effective peritoneal surface area was increased in three patients and decreased in one. Peritoneal permeability to macromolecules remained unchanged as judged by the ratio between the clearance of IgG and albumin. Among the possible factors that contribute to the development of sclerosing peritonitis, some are likely to lead to a larger effective peritoneal surface area, like prostacyclin and the formation of new capillaries in poorly vascularized parts of the peritoneum. Others, such as extensive formation of collagen, could lead to a smaller effective surface area. Individual differences in susceptibility to these factors may lead to an increase or decrease in peritoneal solute transport rates. Follow-up measurements of peritoneal solute kinetics are necessary to identify those patients who are at risk.\r"

In order to limit the exposure of patients to DFO-Al complexes, the efficacy of colloidin-coated microencapsulated charcoal cartridges added in series to conventional dialyzers was investigated. The clearances of Al by the sorbent system were initially 116 +/- 4.7 mL/min, but decreased to 42.5 +/- 6.6 mL/min after 120 minutes of treatment. Thereafter, the Al clearances remained constant. In contrast, the Al clearances of the dialyzer were 29.5 +/- 1.8 mL/min initially and did not change during the treatment period. Both the percent and absolute decrease in Al levels after four hours of dialysis were greater with the dialyzers plus carbon cartridges than with the dialyzers alone. This resulted in an increase in the minimum net Al removal from 1,862 +/- 174 micrograms/treatment to 3,007 +/- 43 micrograms/treatment (P less than 0.05). Treatment with sorbent hemoperfusion should be considered in selected hemodialysis patients being treated with DFO for Al overload.\r"

Albumin excretion rate (AER) was measured and also estimated from the product of the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (A/C) and the calculated 24-hour creatinine excretion. The fractional excretion of albumin (FEA) was also determined in aliquots from each urine sample. The correlation coefficients between measured 24-hour AER and estimated AER were 0.940 and 0.956 for four-hour and overnight collections, respectively (significance of each correlation, P less than 0.001). There was no advantage in using the FEA over the A/C ratio in predicting measured AER. Urinary A/C ratios (mg/mg) between 0.03 and 0.31 in the four-hour collections were highly predictive of microalbuminuria and of measured AER in the 24-hour collections: AER24-h (microgram/min/1.73 m2) = 2.74 + 0.870 x A/C4-h (all log10 values). In a subgroup of 175 patients having all three collections validated, 34 (20%) had microalbuminuria defined as AER 20 to 200 micrograms/min/1.73 m2 in at least two of the three samples and 44 (25%) had overt nephropathy (greater than 200 micrograms/min/1.73 m2). The ability of the AER in one urine collection to predict microalbuminuria in at least one of the other two collections was assessed in these 175 patients. Compared with the overnight urine collection, the four-hour collection had greater sensitivity while affording similar specificity and positive predictive value. Based on these data, the A/C ratio from a morning urine sample following initial AM voiding would seem adequate for the detection and monitoring of microalbuminuria in patients with IDDM.\r"

Theoretical formulas are obtained for calculating the probability of establishing (1) parental origin and meiotic stage of nondisjunction by using a centromeric marker, (2) parental origin of nondisjunction by using a noncentromeric marker, and (3) meiotic stage, given parental origin of nondisjunction. These theoretical calculations demonstrate that parental origin of nondisjunction can be identified with virtual certainty by utilizing multiple genetic markers along a chromosome arm. Centromeric markers are by themselves inefficient for determining meiotic stage of the error, but the efficiency can be considerably increased if parental origin is known with certainty. Even then, multiple centromeric markers may be necessary.\r"

Elevated maternal age-adjusted relative risks of Down syndrome were found for fathers employed as janitors (odds ratio [OR] = 3.26; 95% confidence interval [C.I.] = 1.02-10.44); mechanics (OR = 3.27; C.I. = 1.57-6.80); farm managers/workers (OR = 2.03; C.I. = 1.25-3.03); material-moving equipment operators (OR = 1.88; C.I. = 0.93-3.82); food processors (OR = 1.79; C.I. = 0.96-3.31); sheet-metal workers, iron workers, and other metalworkers (OR = 1.57; C.I. = 0.92-2.69); and sawmill workers (OR = 1.43; C.I. = 0.90-2.66).

A total of 22 different haplotypes were observed in Denmark, Switzerland, and Scotland. Fifteen and 19 haplotypes are associated with the normal (non-PKU) and with the mutant chromosomes, respectively. The haplotype distribution and the allele frequency of normal chromosomes remain constant between Denmark, Switzerland, and Scotland. However, both the haplotype distribution and allele frequencies of mutant chromosomes show significant variation between the three countries.

Severe forms of the disease, which are generally lethal in infancy, are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The gene defects that produce hypophosphatasia are poorly understood, but many are likely to occur at the L/B/K ALP locus. To investigate these gene defects, we analyzed L/B/K ALP DNA, RNA, and enzyme activity in cultured dermal fibroblasts from 14 patients with perinatal or infantile hypophosphatasia and from 12 normal individuals. Southern blot analyses of the L/B/K ALP genes from patients and controls revealed identical restriction patterns. Control fibroblast ALP activity correlated with the corresponding L/B/K ALP mRNA levels estimated by blot hybridization analysis and densitometry (r = .94, P less than .0001). In contrast, fibroblasts from the hypophosphatasia patients were deficient in ALP enzyme activity but expressed apparently full-sized L/B/K ALP mRNA at normal levels. Bone specimens from one of the patients were examined and found to be deficient in histochemical ALP but contained immunologic cross-reactive material detected by anti-human liver ALP antiserum. Our results demonstrate that the deficiency of ALP activity in fibroblasts from 14 patients with severe hypophosphatasia is not due to decreased steady-state levels of the corresponding mRNA. The presence of enzymatically inactive L/B/K ALP protein in one of these patients is consistent with a point mutation or small in-frame deletion in the coding region of L/B/K ALP gene.\r"

Using a 100-kb general jumping library, we isolated two sequential jump clones, J31 and J29, to one side of the D7S8 region and one jump clone, J32, to the other side of D7S8, so that the total region covered is about 300 kb. Three new RFLPs were detected by J29 and J32. Using PFGE mapping and the three jump clones, we found it possible to orient D7S8 on the chromosome and, by linkage analysis, to further narrow the CF region by 100 kb. The orientation of D7S8 will be useful for directing the isolation of other jump clones toward the CF locus. Though the newly described RFLPs are in considerable linkage disequilibrium with D7S8 polymorphisms, they increase the informativeness of genetic markers in the D7S8 region and should be useful in prenatal diagnosis.\r"

We have analyzed several new clones from the same library and have isolated a further cosmid, cNX.6d, which maps approximately 160 kb from CS.7, in the J3.11 direction. A DNA fragment (pMP6d-9) (D7S399) derived from cosmid cNX.6d detects a frequent polymorphism with MspI. Strong linkage disequilibrium between CF and MP6d-9 is found in European populations. Recombinations in two families suggest that CF is between the MspI polymorphic site recognized by pMP6d-9 and the polymorphism recognized by pJ3.11. The new marker is the closest, to date, to CF and will be useful for prenatal diagnosis and carrier testing.\r"

We purified prolidase to homogeneity from normal human fibroblasts, raised a monospecific rabbit antiserum, and studied biosynthesis of the subunit in normal and prolidase--deficient fibroblasts. Pulse-chase immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the subunit is synthesized and retained in cytosol as a 58-KDa polypeptide. Three types of mutations were identified in six prolidase-deficient cell strains; half conferred a CRM-negative phenotype, while the CRM-positive mutations were of two types, one mutation encoding an enlarged subunit (60 KDa) and the others associated with subunits of normal size. Complementation analysis indicated that these mutations map to one locus. Normal subjects and obligate heterozygotes expressing CRM-negative mutations had thermostable prolidase activity at 50 degrees C in cell extracts, whereas heterozygotes expressing CRM-positive mutations had thermolabile activity under the same condition, implying negative allelic complementation in the putative heterodimer. The occurrence of prolidase-like activity about 5% of normal in amount but with a preference for substrate different from normal, in cells homozygous (or compound) for CRM-negative mutations, identified an alternative cleavage activity not encoded at the prolidase locus. Allelic heterogeneity at the major locus and the amount of alternative peptidase activity encoded elsewhere appear to be determinants of the associated and heterogeneous clinical phenotype.\r"

We have constructed a genetic linkage map of seven markers in the vicinity of the MEN-1 locus that has allowed us to map more precisely the gene associated with MEN-1; the target region has been narrowed to about 12 cM. The closely linked markers will be useful also for identification of likely carriers in families in which an allele responsible for MEN-1 segregates.\r"

The preliminary published long-range restriction map was used as a basis for this study. Our data confirm the reported fragment sizes and resolve some discrepancies. In addition, the recently cloned ZFY locus, pDP1007, the putative sex-determining locus, has been used to extend this long-range restriction map on Yp. Thus far, the X and Y copy of this sequence appear to have conserved GC islands around this locus, since it is found on a 280-kb fragment in males and females by using SacII, BssHII, NarI, and NotI. Only two Y-specific sequences of 50 and 70 kb have been detected at the pulsed-field level by using SfiI and NaeI, respectively. No translocation breakpoints have been detected in any of the patients studied. One XX male, GM1889, however, does not have any of the Y-specific fragments detected using conventional or pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. This is one of the few typical XX males who therefore does not have the ZFY copy of the TDF clone. Since all the other XX males hybridized to 47z, which is centromeric to ZFY, a series of DNA loci that are centromeric to 47z need to be studied in order to detect chromosomal breakpoints.\r"

Major adverse effects were observed in 11 (2.8%) patients. Of these, four (1.0%) had agranulocytosis, two (0.5%) were granulocytopenic and five (1.3%) had hepatotoxicity. Agranulocytosis occurred in two patients from each group, 0.7% and 1.9%, respectively from group 1 and group 2. There was no significant difference between the groups or the types of thionamide. There also was no correlation with the patients' age. All of the patients were hyperthyroid, and its onset occurred in the first to third month of treatment. Full recovery was achieved in all cases after drug withdrawal. Four of 5 patients with hepatotoxicity were treated with high PTU doses, and one patient received low MMI doses (p less than .05). All patients were euthyroid. Arthralgias, skin rash and gastric intolerance, the minor adverse effects of thionamides studied, were observed in 52 (13.4%) of the patients. Although no significant differences were found, most of the patients experiencing side effects were from group 1 an received MMI therapy.

Blood samples were obtained from the auricle during the multistage exercise test, and changes in levels of lactate were measured. The exercise was done for 30 minutes three times weekly for 10 weeks. A significant reduction of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure was evident at 10 weeks. Serum concentrations of HDL2 cholesterol increased significantly at 10 weeks, but there were no changes in total and HDL3 cholesterol. No significant changes were observed in serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and apolipoproteins, (apo) A-I, apo A-II, apo B, apo C-II, apo C-III and apo E following 10 weeks of exercise therapy. In the hypertensive controls who were not on exercise therapy, blood pressure as well as all parameters related to lipoproteins remained unchanged.

When TRH (500 ng/kg body weight, IV) was given, the increment in serum TSH at 10 minutes was significantly lower in the PB group (PB, 53 +/- 26 microU/ml vs. control, 131 +/- 18 microU/ml, p less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Prevention of death and injury from motor vehicle accidents depends in part on seat belt use. Understanding the determinants of seat belt use is important for developing strategies to increase seat belt use. The cross-sectional association between body mass index (BMI) and self-reported seat belt use was analyzed using data from 3,140 Health Risk Appraisals completed by Tennessee residents during 1986. Persons in the lowest quintile BMI (less than or equal to 21.8 kg/m2) stated they use seat belts 63% (SD = 38%) of the time compared to persons in the highest BMI quintile (greater than or equal to 29.0 kg/m2) who reported using seat belts 50% (SD = 38%) of the time. BMI remained associated with seat belt use after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, cigarette use, alcohol use, drug use, urban/rural residence, state area of residence, miles driven per year, self-reported physical activity, and satisfaction with life. For a 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI, seat belt use declined -0.73% (95% CI = -1.01, -0.46), and the relative odds of not being a frequent seat belt user increased 3% (odds ratio 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01, 1.05). BMI was the third variable selected in a step-wise multiple linear regression after education and race. The BMI/seat belt association, if causal, has implications for (1) targeting of education programs to likely nonusers by traffic safety agencies; (2) targeting health promotion messages to likely nonusers by primary care providers; and (3) design of automobile seats and restraint devices.\r"

  ".W": "Investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. To characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center (DVAMC) in 1986 were reviewed. During this period, 220 Enterococcus faecalis, 21 Enterococcus faecium, 12 Enterococcus avium, and no Enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the DVAMC microbiology laboratory. Clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. Nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence of the three enterococcal species. Enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. Although Enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. E. avium was more resistant than E. faecalis or E. faecium to penicillin G and ampicillin and less resistant to most other antimicrobial agents. The results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.\r"

  ".W": "The serum fructosamine assay is a new commercially available test designed to measure serum glycated protein as an index of glycemic control in diabetes. The test relies on the ability of glucose bound to protein with a ketamine linkage (fructosamine) to act as a reducing agent in alkaline solution. Serum fructosamine activity was studied in 61 Type I diabetic patients attending a 2-week American Diabetes Association sponsored diabetic camp for children. The initial fructosamine level was found to correlate well with the initial HgA1C value (r = .82, p less than .001). To assess if mean blood glucose correlated with these objective parameters, the authors performed capillary blood glucoses preprandially and at bedtime on all 61 diabetic campers during the 2-week period of observation and reassessed serum fructosamine activity and HgA1C on day 14 of camp. We found the HgA1C and fructosamine correlated well with the mean daily blood glucose obtained during the preceding week (r = .45, p less than .01 and r = .58, p less than .01) respectively. Our data suggest that the serum fructosamine is as effective as the HgA1C in correlating to mean blood glucose control in this cross-sectional study of Type I diabetic patients.\r"
