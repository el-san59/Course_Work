  ".W": "Isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5MN) is an active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate, but unlike its parent compound, is nearly 100% bioavailable after oral administration. Once-a-day therapy with a slow-release formulation of IS-5MN is used widely in Europe for 24-hour prophylaxis of angina pectoris. In a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the duration of effects of 50 and 100 mg of slow-release IS-5MN were evaluated after the first dose and after once-a-day therapy for 1 week in 9 patients with stable angina pectoris. Compared with placebo values, standing blood pressure decreased (p less than 0.001) and exercise time to the onset of angina and total exercise duration increased (p less than 0.008 and p less than 0.003) at 4 hours, but not at 20 or 24 hours after first dose of 50 and 100 mg of slow-release IS-5MN. After once-a-day therapy for 1 week, no improvement in exercise duration or reduction in ST-segment depression was seen after 50 or 100 mg of slow-release IS-5MN at 4, 20 or 24 hours despite high plasma IS-5MN concentrations. Thus, despite therapeutic plasma concentrations, 50 and 100 mg of slow-release IS-5MN did not exert antianginal or anti-ischemic effects at 20 and 24 hours after the first dose and at 4, 20 and 24 hours after sustained once-a-day therapy for 1 week.\r"

Forty-seven had at least 1 mm of ST deviation in response to provocation of coronary vasoconstriction by prolonged hyperventilation (group I); 143 had no ST deviation (group II). The angiographic response to this test was studied in 21 patients from group I, and revealed 25 to 100% diameter reduction; in group II 9 patients showed a 5 to 14% diameter reduction. In group I, 15 patients (32%) died (hazard rate = 0.17 deaths/patients X years) vs 18 (13%) in group II (hazard rate = 0.06) (p less than 0.01). Seven patients in group I (15%) and 3 in group 2 (2%) died while waiting for surgery (p less than 0.01). All patients who died had coronary stenoses of at least 70%. A Cox regression analysis, using 24 variables (invasive and noninvasive), showed a positive hyperventilation test (ST deviation at least 1 mm), low ejection fraction and systolic blood pressure of at least 160 mm Hg to be independent predictors of death (p less than 0.05). Considering only deaths in non-operated patients (patients waiting for surgery and patients not planned to undergo operation), a rate-pressure product/100 of 150 or less at exercise stress testing, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 15 mm Hg or more and duration of angina less than 1 year were also independent predictors of death. Thus, the hyperventilation test may be useful for identifying angina patients who are at high risk of cardiac death due to dynamic coronary obstructions.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of a new vasodilating beta-blocking drug, carvedilol, were studied in 20 patients with chronic stable angina using a single-blind, placebo-controlled protocol. Two doses of carvedilol, 25 mg twice daily and 50 mg twice daily, were compared with placebo using analysis of variance. The study design consisted of 2 weekly phases of initial placebo followed by carvedilol, 25 mg twice daily and then 50 mg twice daily, and a second placebo period. Supine rest and exercise radionuclide ventriculography was performed at the end of each phase. Carvedilol produced a significant dose-related reduction in rest and exercise heart rate and blood pressure (p less than 0.01 to less than 0.0001). Ejection fraction at rest increased significantly, from a mean (+/- standard error) of 53 +/- 3% with placebo to 58 +/- 3% with carvedilol, 50 mg twice daily, but no improvement was noted in ejection fraction on exercise. Relative, counts-based end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were significantly reduced at rest (p less than 0.001). Rest peak filling rate index, first-third filling fraction and ejection rate index increased significantly with carvedilol. A dose-related change was observed with rest ejection fraction, peak filling rate index and ejection rate index. Exercise-induced ST-segment depression improved significantly with both doses of carvedilol compared with placebo. Carvedilol was well tolerated and produced significant hemodynamic improvement. This salutary effect on left ventricular function may confer advantages in long-term treatment of patients with chronic stable angina.\r"

The hemodynamic responses to nifedipine were similar in the 2 groups, but was greater in patients taking propranolol. At 10 minutes, systemic vascular resistance decreased by 47% in patients taking propranolol and by 39% in the control group; mean aortic pressures decreased by 25% and 10%; heart rate increased by 23% and 19%; and cardiac index increased by 45% in both groups.

Intravenous nicardipine infusion (5 mg) did not induce negative inotropic effects in patients with chronic coronary heart disease, and no evidence of congestive heart failure was seen, even in patients receiving large doses of propranolol. Nicardipine counteracted the potential deleterious effects of propranolol; increased peripheral vascular resistance and left ventricular stroke work and decreased cardiac output.\r"

Of 544 patients with creatine kinase (CK)-MB-confirmed non-Q-wave AMI randomized to the prospective multicenter Diltiazem Reinfarction Study, 50 patients (9.2%) had isolated precordial ST-segment depression of 1 mm or more in 2 or more contiguous precordial electrocardiographic leads (V1-V4). Serial electrocardiograms recorded at study entry (mean 50.5 hours after onset of chest pain), on study day 2, study day 3 and at predischarge showed that in 23 of 50 patients (40%) electrocardiographic evidence of posterior AMI evolved, defined as an R wave of 0.04 second or more in lead V1 and an R:S greater than or equal to 1 in lead V2. In 18 of these 23 patients (78%), posterior AMI had evolved by study day 3, and none had an abnormal reelevation of CK-MB (every 12-hour sampling) for up to 14 days of hospitalization. Compared with the remaining 27 patients who had electrocardiographic features of anterior non-Q-wave AMI only, the 23 with initial precordial ST segment depression in whom posterior AMI developed had significantly higher mean peak CK values (1,051 +/- 172 vs 663 +/- 89 IU, p less than 0.009) and greater mean precordial ST-segment depression in lead V1 (0.28 vs + 0.19 mm, p = 0.01), in lead V2 (1.3 vs 0.26 mm, p = 0.003) and in lead V3 (2.0 vs 0.93 mm, p = 0.0004).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To investigate this possibility, the short-term (2-week) clinical course of 81 consecutive patients managed within a randomized intracoronary thrombolysis trial was reviewed. All patients underwent coronary angiography within 5 hours of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction and were stratified into the following 3 outcome groups: patients with initially subtotal occlusion (subtotal group, n = 17), those with initial total occlusion and infarct artery reperfusion (reperfused group, n = 24) and those with continued infarct artery occlusion (occluded group, n = 40). Recurrent ischemic events were defined as spontaneous typical angina, provokable angina on predischarge exercise testing, and reinfarction. Eleven of 17 patients (65%) in the subtotal and 11 of 23 patients (48%) in the reperfused groups had an ischemic event (difference not significant). In contrast, 4 of 37 patients (11%) with occlusion had an ischemic event (p less than 0.01 compared with patients in the subtotal or reperfused groups). Four patients were excluded because of early (within 72 hours) elective coronary bypass surgery or death from pump failure. To eliminate the impact of multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD), 39 patients with 1-vessel CAD were analyzed separately. Five of 9 patients (56%) in the subtotal group, 3 of 10 (30%) in the reperfused group and only 2 of 20 (10%) in the occluded group had an ischemic event. These observations suggest the need for a more definitive revascularization strategy for acute myocardial infarction.\r"

Biplane analysis was particularly important in the 12 patients with right coronary artery occlusion, among whom the right anterior oblique view showed improvement in only 1 patient but the left anterior oblique view showed improvement in 6 patients (p less than 0.05). Biplane analysis is more sensitive than monoplane right anterior oblique analysis alone for detecting improvement in LV function after reperfusion therapy for AMI. However, both views are complementary, adding information about regional function not revealed by either view alone.\r"

Recurrent syncope occurred in 19% of group I, 6% of group II, 33% of group III and 19% of group IV. In symptomatic patients with bundle branch block and normal electrophysiologic test results, prognosis is good without treatment. In patients undergoing permanent pacing based on electrophysiologic testing, survival is good and rate of symptom recurrence is low. Electrophysiologic testing identifies patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia for whom antiarrhythmic therapy is indicated but who nevertheless have a poor prognosis.\r"

From January 1970 to December 1985, 96 patients aged 1 day to 20 years underwent 162 pulse generator implantation procedures. Indication for initial implantation was surgically induced heart block in 52 patients, sick sinus syndrome in 20, congenital complete heart block with symptoms of low cardiac output in 19 and tachydysrhythmia control in 5. Modal age at initial implantation was less than 1 year; median age was 5 years. During this period 90 generators were removed from service: 49 (54%) because of generator failure, 22 (24%) because the patient died, 12 (13%) because of elective upgrade at the time of lead failure or cardiac surgery, 5 (6%) because of generator pocket infection and 2 (2%) because of manufacturer's recall. Pulse generators were separated into 4 groups based upon generator technology. Group I (n = 16) were asynchronous units with mercury-zinc batteries; group II (n = 18) were single-chamber demand units with mercury-zinc batteries; group III (n = 14) were single-chamber demand units with rechargeable batteries; and group IV (n = 114) were single- or dual-chamber demand units with lithium batteries. Patient survival rate was 84% at 6 months and 70% by 109 months. There was no further decrease to the end of the study period. Six-month generator survival rate was 82% for all groups, mostly a reflection of patient deaths.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Thirty-eight patients (age 57 +/- 19 years), of whom 87% had angiographic coronary artery disease, underwent quantitative TI-201 exercise scintigraphy within 14 days of invasive electrophysiologic testing. The mean rest ejection fraction was 38 +/- 9%. Eighty percent of patients had 1 or more regions with akinetic or dyskinetic wall motion. Thallium-201 scan segments were scored as normal or containing redistribution defects or mild or severe persistent defects. Only 4 patients (10%) had only redistribution defects and 9 (24%) had both redistribution defects and persistent defects; 32 of 38 patients (84%) had 1 or more persistent defects, of which 26 had at least 1 severe, persistent defect (more than 50% reduction in TI-201 activity). Patients with and without exercise-induced VT had a similar prevalence of redistribution. Redistribution defect prevalence was similar in patients with polymorphic VT (3 of 13) and monomorphic VT (10 of 25) during programmed electrical stimulation (difference not significant). Thus, patients with VT or VF induced by programmed ventricular stimulation have extensive TI-201 scintigraphic abnormalities on exercise scintigrams, predominantly those suggesting scar, with associated severe regional wall motion abnormalities at rest. The scintigraphic prevalence of exercise-induced ischemia is low and TI-201 redistribution and exercise ST depression are observed with equal frequency in patients with and those without VT induced during exercise.\r"

No antithyroid treatment proved useful. Thyroid function returned to normal 3 to 7 months after stopping amiodarone therapy. In the hypothyroid group, a high thyroid-stimulating hormone was the most specific laboratory finding. These patients were treated with substitute therapy with or without withdrawal of amiodarone. The iodine content of the thyroid gland in part of this population taking amiodarone was measured by in vivo x-ray fluorescence. Patients in whom thyrotoxicosis developed showed especially high iodine contents. During treatment with amiodarone, patients at high risk of thyrotoxicosis were recognized by increasing TT3 values and higher iodine thyroid levels. A reduction in maintenance dose should be considered in this specific population.\r"

Age-adjusted estimates of association between echocardiographic measurements of left ventricular (LV) structure and function and complex or frequent (Lown grade 2 or greater) ventricular arrhythmia were computed using logistic regression. In this bivariate model only LV internal diameter (systolic and diastolic) and fractional shortening were associated with arrhythmia in both sexes (p less than 0.01). When all variables were entered into a multivariate model, only age and systolic LV internal diameter remained independently associated with arrhythmia (p less than 0.001). Thus, LV chamber size and function are important predictors of risk for ventricular arrhythmia. Systolic LV internal diameter, which reflects both functional and structural information, is the only measurement independently predictive of arrhythmia risk in persons free of apparent heart disease.\r"

The study group consisted of 38 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 9 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and 14 with a normal heart. Nonsustained VT (at least 3 but not more than 15 beats) was induced in 46%, sustained VT (more than 15 beats) in 15% and no VT in 39%. Sustained VT was induced more frequently in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction (p = 0.005) but was not related to the presence of CAD. Over a mean follow-up of 26 months, 10 patients died from cardiac causes (4 suddenly), including 1 patient with inducible sustained VT, 2 with nonsustained VT and 7 with no inducible VT. Inducibility was not related to survival, either as a single variable or when combined with CAD, left ventricular dysfunction or recent myocardial infarction. Left ventricular function alone was a good predictor of outcome. Of 46 patients with an ejection fraction of 35% more or in New York Heart Association functional class I or II, 3 (7%) died from cardiac causes, compared with 7 of 13 patients (54%) with an ejection fraction of less than 35% or in functional class III or IV (p = 0.0001). Thus, in patients with nonsustained VT, the incidence of sustained VT during electrophysiologic testing is low and is related to the degree of left ventricular dysfunction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The intrinsic parasystolic cycle lengths ranged from 1,100 to 1,800 ms. Premature stimuli altered the duration of the parasystolic cycle lengths by amounts that depended on timing of the test impulses within the parasystolic cycles. Premature impulses delivered during the first part of the parasystolic cycles prolonged the parasystolic cycle lengths to 107 to 151% of the intrinsic parasystolic cycle lengths and impulses applied during the second part abbreviated them to 70 to 81% of the intrinsic parasystolic cycle lengths. In 10 patients the accelerating effects were of greater magnitude than the decelerating effects. Transition from the accelerating to slowing phases was progressive or unstable in 9 patients and abrupt in 2. Changes induced by individual stimuli were short-lived and the parasystolic pacemakers returned immediately to their original rates. In 1 patient the biphasic sensitivity of parasystole to premature stimuli was shown to sustain for 21 days.\r"

In each patient, anterograde conduction over the accessory pathway was present at relatively slow sinus rates, but the accessory pathway anterograde effective refractory period was substantially prolonged. During premature atrial stimulation, a \"window\" of supernormal conduction was identified at which closely coupled atrial extrastimuli conducted over the accessory pathway, whereas longer premature intervals resulted in accessory pathway block. Causes other than supernormal conduction to explain this phenomenon, for example, phase 4 block, were unlikely in each case. Although the mechanism of supernormal conduction in humans is unknown, the electrophysiologic findings in our patients are similar to those reported in patients with supernormal conduction in the His-Purkinje system.\r"

Within the complete 24-hour heart rate spectrum, zones were demonstrated that were characterized by manifest or concealed bigeminy or manifest or concealed trigeminy. Bigeminy zones were found in 26 and trigeminy zones in 21 of 42 patients. Bigeminy zones were found at a significantly lower heart rate, on the average, then trigeminy zones. In 10 patients both bigeminy and trigeminy zones were observed. Bigeminy and trigeminy zones probably correspond to the distribution patterns of VPCs predicted from modulation of a pacemaker and reflected reentry, both of which can be induced by electrotonically mediated impulses across a zone of impaired conduction in isolated bundles of Purkinje fibers. The bigeminy and trigeminy zones will correspond at least partly to the entrainment zones found during electrotonic modulation of parasystolic foci. The bigeminy zones will correspond to 2:1 entrainment and the trigeminy zones mainly to 3:1 entrainment.\r"

Because AF often occurs in elderly patients and is associated with coronary artery disease, patients presenting for the first time are often selected for admission to the coronary care unit to exclude the possibility of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A review of 245 patients with AF admitted to an intensive care unit revealed 45 cases that were of new onset. AMI was diagnosed in 5 (11%) on the basis of elevated serum creatine kinase-MB levels. Evaluation of 56 clinical variables available during initial assessment indicated that infarction patients could be distinguished from others by the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (p less than 0.01), electrocardiographic evidence of old myocardial infarction (p less than 0.01), typical cardiac chest pain (p less than 0.01), and duration of cardiac symptoms less than 4 hours (p less than 0.05). The presence of 2 or more of these features identified all AMI patients and 7 others at high risk for serious cardiac complications. The findings indicate that new-onset AF in the absence of clinical predictors suggesting myocardial ischemia or AMI does not warrant routine admission to the coronary care unit.\r"

Mean follow-up was 29 months among patients who underwent catheter ablation and 53 months among those who underwent cryosurgical ablation. In both groups complete heart block was produced in most patients (88% in the catheter ablation group, 86% in the cryosurgery group), and similar proportions of patients continued to receive antiarrhythmic drugs (27% in the catheter ablation group, 36% in the cryosurgery group). However, the short-term morbidity rate was significantly lower among patients who underwent catheter ablation (12% vs 42%) (p = 0.004). Long-term mortality and morbidity rates were not significantly different; most deaths were related to underlying cardiopulmonary disease and morbidity to problems with permanent pacemakers. Both catheter ablation and cryosurgical ablation of the AV junction are effective in creating complete AV block and controlling supraventricular tachycardia in medically refractory patients. Because catheter ablation is associated with lower short-term morbidity and avoids the need for a major surgical procedure, it is preferable to cryosurgical ablation of the AV junction when permanent abolition of AV conduction is necessary.\r"

The incidence of arrhythmias during graded maximal treadmill exercise in a group of 68 subjects with mild, clinically uncomplicated systemic hypertension treated chronically with diuretics alone for a median of 4.5 years was compared with that in an age-matched normotensive control group. The prevalence of exercise-induced arrhythmias was higher in the group treated with diuretics than in the control group, 57% vs 38% (p less than 0.05). This difference was entirely due to the higher incidence of isolated atrial or ventricular premature complexes in the diuretic-treated patients, 44% vs 26% (p less than 0.05). There was no difference in the incidence of frequent (more than 10% of beats) or complex supraventricular or ventricular premature complexes between the diuretic-treated and control groups. Within the diuretic group, no difference in the incidence of simple or complex arrhythmia was found between men and women, between those with and those without rest or exercise-induced electrocardiographic abnormalities or between those with a serum potassium level of less than 3.7 mEq/liter vs those with a level of 3.7 mEq/liter or greater. Thus, patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with chronic diuretic monotherapy do not appear to be at increased risk for major arrhythmias during aerobic exercise.\r"

Group 1 patients showed cyclic fluctuations in minute ventilation (change of 30 to 40 liters/min) and arterial PO2 (change of 38.0 +/- 4.1 mm Hg) and PCO2 (change of 11 +/- 2.8 mm Hg).

The amplitude of ventilatory oscillations in group 1 patients increased in the transition from rest to light exercise and damped with heavy exercise. There was no evidence of alveolar hypoventilation at the nadirs of minute ventilation; arterial PCO2 was always 40 mm Hg or less. Substantial hyperventilation (ventilatory equivalent for CO2 twice normal) occurred with maximal minute ventilation in group 1 patients. Oscillatory hyperventilation correlated with severity of CHF. Maximal oxygen uptake was significantly lower in group 1 (11.7 +/- 1.1 ml/kg/min) than group 3 (17.9 +/- 1.8 ml/kg/min) (p less than 0.05).

In the absence of obstruction, this relation is linear. The effect of the normal mitral valve area on this pressure-flow relation has not been previously examined. Pulsed Doppler studies of transmitral flow were performed simultaneously with thermodilution cardiac outputs in 25 patients in sinus rhythm and with no valvular disease. Mean flow rate was determined as thermodilution stroke volume/diastolic filling period measured by Doppler. Several instantaneous pressure gradients were estimated from multiple velocity measurements using the modified Bernoulli equation and were plotted against time. Mean pressure gradient was estimated by dividing the area under the pressure-time curve by the diastolic filling period. Average and standard deviation of mean flow rate and pressure gradient was 223 +/- 70 ml/s and 1.4 +/- 0.8 mm Hg, respectively. There was an excellent linear correlation between these 2 parameters (r = 0.91, SEE = 30 ml/s). This confirms the linear relation of mean pressure gradient to mean flow rate in the absence of obstruction. The excellent correlation, obtained without considerations of individual variations of valve area, suggests that this relation is independent of valve area, under normal physiologic conditions.\r"

Regression of TBW on lean body mass suggested that hydration of the fat-free body was higher than for normally nourished children of comparable age.

TBW was most highly correlated with height and weight, both with r = 0.95.

Estimated energy expended during 8 h of high-intensity exercise (55% VO2 max) for three subjects was 757 +/- 118 kcal/h by the doubly-labelled-water method using urine and a two-point calculation, which compared favorably with 735 +/- 82 kcal/h obtained by respiratory gas exchange. For the fourth subject, daytime, nighttime, and daily energy expenditure was calculated by both the two-pair method and decay-curve analysis of urine and saliva samples collected in the morning and at night. Daytime and nighttime energy expenditures differed significantly (p less than 0.05).\r"

Mean daily EE was significantly higher in the pooled obese women (2472 +/- 488 kcal) than in lean women (1979 +/- 302 kcal) due to higher energy costs of sedentary and light activity in the obese. EE during moderate-to-strenuous activity was similar between groups because lean women performed these activities more vigorously. AOO and COO differed significantly in neither mean EE nor habitual activity. Fat-free mass (FFM) was a better predictor than body weight of both mean daily EE and the energy cost of activity. These data indicate that EE is positively related to obesity. Obese women tend to limit possible EE by reducing the vigorousness of weight-supported activity.\r"

To assess toxicity of the fecal fractions, we examined the ability of fecal supernatants to lyse human erythrocytes. Bile acid concentrations in fecal water from the low-fat group were reduced significantly from 180 +/- 60 microM to 100 +/- 70 microM; in the high-fat group, increased from 190 +/- 60 microM to 250 +/- 100 microM. Erythrocyte lysis was 76% for the high-fat group, 37% for the low-fat group. There was a significant weak correlation between aqueous bile acid concentration and cell lysis. Results suggest that diet can influence concentrations of detergents in the aqueous phase of human stool and the potential toxicity of this fraction to cell membranes.\r"

In the presence of both ephedrine and aspirin, increase in energy expenditure found during treatment with ephedrine alone was doubled, and the obese group lost greater than 75% of body fat: obesity was reversed. These studies indicate that although aspirin administered alone has no influence on energy balance it can markedly potentiate thermogenic properties of ephedrine, effects which led to a normalization of body composition of the obese to that of the lean. Such ephedrine-aspirin mixtures, often found in over-the-counter preparations for asthma and bronchial disorders, could be put to new use as aids for treatment of human obesity.\r"

They reviewed the pathologic findings and clinical follow-up of 14 patients with dysplasia in Barrett's mucosa in endoscopic biopsy specimens. They also studied systematically the histopathologic features of the Barrett's mucosa in 43 esophagectomy specimens resected for Barrett's carcinoma. In the biopsy specimens, dysplasia occurred in distinctive-type Barrett's mucosa of 13 patients (93%) but in cardiac-type mucosa of only 3 (21%). Six patients had high-grade dysplasia; five underwent esophagectomy and three of these were found to have superficially invasive adenocarcinoma. The other patient with high-grade dysplasia as well as eight patients with intermediate- or low-grade dysplasia are not known to have carcinoma on available follow-up. In the study of resection specimens, high-grade dysplasia was strongly associated with adjoining invasive adenocarcinoma, because 84% of areas with invasion had high-grade dysplasia and 92% of areas with high-grade dysplasia showed invasion. The authors' findings suggest that the dysplasia-carcinoma sequence most commonly occurs in Barrett's mucosa of the distinctive type; high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's mucosa is a marker indicating high probability of invasive carcinoma; the presence of high-grade dysplasia in biopsy specimens of Barrett's mucosa is an indication for esophagectomy in suitable surgical candidates.\r"

Eight hyperplastic polyps were diploid. These results show retrospective FCM analysis can detect DNA aneuploidy in polyps; DNA aneuploidy may occur before histologic evidence of invasive carcinoma; and this change is more frequent in types of polyps thought to have increased malignant potential (i.e., those with villous morphology and/or CIS).\r"

These six types were subsequently combined into three prognostic grades: low, intermediate, and high, analogous to the malignant lymphomas. The quantity of plasma cell burden in the biopsy proved to be a useful criterion for histologic staging of MM, supplementing any clinical staging system in use. Both these parameters, grade and stage, provide information required for decisions on treatment modalities, while the effects of therapy can be monitored by sequential biopsies.\r"

Intraepithelial T11+ cells were decreased (P less than 0.05) in the small bowel of AIDS and ARC patients, primarily because of the near complete absence of T4+ lymphocytes. In the lamina propria of these patients, a depletion of T4+ cells (P less than 0.05), an increase in T8+ cells (P less than 0.05), and a reversal of the T4/T8 ratio were observed (e.g., the small bowel ratio was 0.1 +/- 0.02 vs. the normal ratio of 2.3 +/- 0.2 and the rectal ratios were 0.2 +/- 0.06 vs. normal 2.6 +/- 0.3). The T-lymphocytes in the intestine of AIDS and ARC patients did not express the receptor for interleukin-2 (IL-2). A near complete absence of T4+ lymphocytes was also seen in lymphoid follicles in the rectum. B1+ cells were not depleted. The reversal of the T4/T8 ratio, which is a hallmark of AIDS, occurs not only in the circulation but also in the gastrointestinal tissues of patients with AIDS and ARC.\r"

This study established reliable reference ranges for these platelet parameters while taking into consideration the effects of age and sex in a study population of 447 normal persons. There was an inverse, nonlinear relationship between MPV and platelet count, with no statistical difference (P greater than 0.05) seen between males and females. Platelet-crit showed no variation with respect to age or sex, however, a direct, linear relationship was suggested between PCT and platelet count.

In two hospitals, the median prothrombin times and Factor IX antigen levels were 19 and 20 seconds and 0.10 and 0.11 U/mL (kU/L), respectively.

Because HbB is present only until a child is six months of age, and the hematologic manifestations of the carrier state may be mild, early detection is important. This study identified a logarithmic relationship between the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and HbB. Additionally, a discrimination level of 93.5 fL. was calculated to screen for neonates that required evaluation with hemoglobin electrophoresis to identify two- and possibly three-gene deletion alpha-thalassemia.

Because injury to the arm or the presence of intravascular cannulae often preclude the determination of SBTs on the upper extremity, the authors compared the SBT on the arm with the bleeding time on the leg to ascertain the efficacy of the lower extremity for this test. Thirty healthy volunteers were enrolled in the study. Bleeding times were performed on the forearm and on the medial aspect of the calf. The subjects then ingested 650 mg of aspirin, and the tests were repeated two hours later on the contralateral extremities. The mean preaspirin SBT (5.6 +/- 1.7 minutes did not differ significantly from the mean bleeding time on the leg (5.8 +/- 2.3 minutes) (P greater than 0.50), nor was there a significant difference between the mean postaspirin bleeding time on the arm (10.2 +/- 4.3 minutes) and that on the leg (9.9 +/- 3.7 minutes) (P greater than 0.50). On the basis of this study, the authors conclude that the arm and leg are equally reliable sites for determining bleeding times in normal persons and are equally sensitive for detection of aspirin-induced prolongation of bleeding.\r"

  ".W": "The value of Cefinase (BBL Microbiology Systems, Cockeysville, M.D.) disks in predicting penicillin responses of coagulase-negative staphylococci was studied with the use of clinical isolates. The beta-lactamase activity of each isolate was determined both before and after enzyme induction for 18-24 hours with a 5-micrograms methicillin disk. Penicillin responses were determined in microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) panels after 18 hours of incubation at 35 degrees C. Of 485 isolates tested, 338 (70%) were beta-lactamase positive, 168 (35%) before and 170 (35%) after induction. Only two (0.6%) of these isolates had a penicillin MIC of less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/mL (less than or equal to 0.12 mg/L). Of the 147 Cefinase-negative isolates, penicillin MICs of 0.12 microgram/mL or less (less than or equal to 0.12 mg/L) and 0.25 microgram/mL or more (greater than or equal to 0.25 mg/L) were obtained from 110 (75%) and 37 (25%), respectively. Although Staphylococcus saprophyticus accounted for only 30 (6%) of the total isolates, 54% of the organisms that were beta-lactamase negative with penicillin MICs of greater than or equal to 0.25 microgram/mL (greater than or equal to 0.25 mg/L) belonged to that species. A positive Cefinase test accurately predicted elevated penicillin MICs, but a negative test, especially with S. saprophyticus, was of less value.\r"

The normal range for plasma protein C in the assay is 72-130% (+/- 2 SD) (0.7-1.30). Hepatocellular disease lengthening the prothrombin time by 3-4 seconds was associated with plasma protein C activity of 25% (0.25) to 35% (0.35). Although the assay is thought to accurately measure protein C activity in patients taking warfarin, one cannot evaluate such patients for hereditary functional protein C deficiency because treatment with warfarin will itself reduce the ratio of protein C activity to antigen. The assay can be used in a patient receiving heparin if the heparin is removed as described.\r"

Red blood cell zinc protoporphyrin (RBC ZP) was evaluated as a screening test to improve the accuracy of detecting anemia in prospective blood donors. The frequency of abnormally low venous hemoglobin concentrations in anemia deferrals having fingerstick capillary microhematocrit (MH) values within 3% of the minimum requirement, together with normal RBC ZP levels (less than 53 micrograms/dL [0.943 mumol/L] RBC), was 2%, and not significantly different from the prevalence of venous anemia observed in eligible blood donors. Anemia deferrals with elevated RBC ZP results had a significantly increased rate of iron depletion and anemia. Capillary RBC ZP measurements in combination with the MH test have the potential to safely decrease inappropriate anemia deferrals.\r"

Hanover, NJ), and 125I RIA (substituted 3H-tracer in Sandoz Kit with 125I tracer made by Immuno Nuclear Corporation, Stillwater, MN). Results obtained by the 125I RIA correlated well with results obtained by the 3H RIA. Both RIA methods had similar correlation with the HPLC method. The 125I RIA method showed higher sensitivity and greater precision than the 3H RIA method. The authors conclude that the 125I RIA method can be used for cyclosporine determination in whole blood specimens. The use of the 125I RIA provides a simple and rapid method with higher counting efficiency and less background quenching than the 3H RIA method, which requires cumbersome liquid scintillation counting procedures.\r"

At autopsy, intracellular and extracellular I. belli organisms were identified in the mucosa and lamina propria of small and large intestine as well as in mesenteric and tracheobronchial lymph nodes, where an associated granulomatous reaction was also present. Until now, Isosporiasis has been observed as intracellular parasites restricted to the columnar cells of the intestinal mucosa in humans hosts. This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first time that this protozoa has been observed invading beyond the intestinal wall. This patient's autopsy also demonstrated intestinal ulcerations proven microscopically to be caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV). In patients with AIDS and CMV enterocolitis, the authors have observed an unusual frequency of extraintestinal disseminated disease by microorganisms heretofore typically restricted to the intestinal mucosa (i.e., bacteremias resulting from Shigella species). The authors propose that, in AIDS patients, the profound immunodeficient state, possibly in conjunction with CMV-induced intestinal mucosal ulcerations, promotes access of other intestinal microorganisms, including I. belli, into lymphatic and vascular spaces, culminating in lymphohematogenous dissemination of their intestinal infestations.\r"

Corresponding respective annual incidences per 1000 pupils of 10-19 yr were: 0.3, 0.6, 1.9, 1.7, 9.8, and 7.8. Thus, appendectomy is rare or infrequent in all except the white populations. Peak occurrence was postpubertal. There was no consistent sex bias. Dietarily, mean daily fiber intake was relatively low in all groups, 17.9-26.1 g. While the percentage of energy from fat intake was low in blacks, 16.3-22.3%, it was much higher in the other populations, 32.7-39.5%. Clearly, factors other than diet are involved in regulating frequency of appendectomy. While mortality is negligible and morbidity slight, elucidation of causation and prevention of the disease is desirable since subsequently appendectomy patients are at greater than average risk to certain cancers.\r"

  ".U": "87153292\r", 
  ".W": "To assess the spectrum of hepatic abnormalities in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), we reviewed clinical, biochemical, and pathological material in 32 patients with AIDS. Eight-four percent of AIDS cases had a history of intravenous drug abuse. Ninety percent of AIDS patients has some liver biochemical abnormality at the first presentation of illness. During the course of AIDS, significant (p less than 0.05, paired Student's t test) rises in alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin occurred, without rises in aminotransferases. Mean abnormalities were mild, reflecting approximately 2-fold increases over baseline. Liver failure was not believed to contribute to the death of any AIDS patient. Pathological findings in AIDS included specific infectious diagnosis in 26%, granulomas in 16%, hemosiderosis in 26%, nonspecific abnormalities in 39%, cirrhosis in 23%, and chronic active hepatitis in 3%. AIDS cases were also compared to 10 selected age, sex, and epidemiologically similar non-AIDS patients. Although granulomas or infections were not seen in our comparison group, only the incidence of chronic active hepatitis was significantly different between the groups. If only those with intravenous drug abuse were studied, then none of 24 AIDS patients versus four of eight non-AIDS cases (p less than 0.005) had chronic active hepatitis. AIDS patients with specific hepatic infections tended to have a higher alkaline phosphatase and aspartate aminotransferase (p less than 0.05) than noninfected cases. However, substantial overlap existed, and no difference in hepatomegaly was noted. Ninety percent of AIDS patients were ingesting at least one potentially hepatotoxic drug. We conclude that AIDS patients have a high incidence of underlying hepatic abnormalities. However, clinical and biochemical abnormalities are similar in our selected liver biopsy patients with intravenous drug abuse with or without AIDS. As expected, AIDS patients have a higher incidence of hepatic granulomas and infections, but these patients were not clearly distinguishable from other AIDS cases. Histological examination showed a wide array of changes by light microscopy, but no specific lesion of AIDS was noted. The low incidence of chronic active hepatitis in this AIDS population may imply that the altered T lymphocyte function in AIDS could influence the course of liver disease in these patients.\r"

Iron was detected in the lamina propria of the stomach in five and duodenum in four cases. A similar distribution of iron overload, usually of lesser degree, was also observed in five alcoholics. Serum ferritin levels and the degree of gastric and/or duodenal iron deposits did not correlate in either hemochromatosis patients or alcoholics. No gastric or duodenal siderosis was observed in nonulcer dyspepsia cases. The absence of gastric and duodenal stainable iron in some hemochromatosis patients and its presence in some alcoholics suggests that the diagnostic value of upper gastrointestinal biopsy in primary hemochromatosis is limited.\r"

Extended sphincteroplasty and cystduodenostomy as well as Roux-en-Y pancreatojejunostomy were necessary to insure adequate accessory duct drainage. Surgical therapy of pancreas divisum in chronic pancreatitis should be designed to correct existing pancreatic duct obstruction.\r"

Four children had only a single episode, seven children experienced only one to three relapses early in their course, and the remaining 49 patients (82%) experienced frequently relapsing steroid-dependent disease. Nearly half of these (47%) continued to relapse into their late teens and early twenties. All 20 children treated with cyclophosphamide because of steroid-induced side effects developed complete remissions of the nephrotic syndrome. These were sustained in 70% for 9.1 +/- 0.6 years, with a reduction of disease severity in the remaining 30%. In contrast, only 48% of patients treated with prednisone alone were in remission at last follow-up (P = .06). Ten of the children treated with cyclophosphamide had the minimal change lesion prior to therapy; 90% of these had permanent remissions. Only 50% of the six children with focal glomerulosclerosis and four children with mesangial proliferation have had permanent remissions. None of the patients developed renal insufficiency. Children treated with prednisone alone were -0.93 +/- 0.3 SD below the mean for height at last follow-up. Cyclophosphamide treatment was associated with an increase in height SD scores from -0.84 +/- 0.4 to -0.28 +/- 0.3. Children with severe growth impairment demonstrated dramatic catch-up growth when treated with cyclophosphamide with SD scores increasing from -2.29 +/- 0.8 to -0.43 +/- 0.6 (P less than .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

MPGN III was detected with greater frequency by the chance discovery of hematuria and proteinuria in the otherwise healthy individual (MPGN III, 63%; MPGN I, 30%; P = .01) and never, in the absence of renal failure, presented with systemic symptoms such as ease of fatigue, weight loss, and pallor, as may patients with MPGN I. The more frequent detection of MPGN III by chance is evidence that its onset is insidious and that for long periods it produces no symptoms or signs. Glomerular proliferation is also less than in MPGN I. Further, in MPGN III, the complement perturbation and glomerular immunofluorescence give no evidence of classical pathway activation, for which there is abundant evidence in MPGN I. Even with severe hypocomplementemia in MPGN III, C3 nephritic factor, another cause of hypocomplementemia, is rarely detectable and then in very low concentration. The cause of the complement perturbation in MPGN III has so far escaped identification. Although these observations give evidence that MPGN III is distinct from MPGN I, there is compelling evidence from other studies that a predisposition to both types is inherited and that similar genetic factors are operative in the two types. Because their genetic basis appears to be the same, it must be concluded that despite their differences, types I and III are variants of the same disease.\r"

The specificities of both monoclonal antibodies were elaborated in the indirect as well as in the direct immunofluorescence technique. Both antibodies were then used to identify cellular fragments obtained from the urine of patients treated with cytostatic drugs by ultracentrifugation. By application of the indirect immunogold method, it was shown that material of proximal as well as distal tubular origin was shed by the damaged cells. Whereas the proximal tubular antigenic epitope recognized by PM II 39 H11 was always found in large irregular complexes of debris-containing vesicles, the distal tubular antigenic epitope recognized by PM II 9 C2 was always found associated with filament-like regular structures. This is the first report in which excretion of components of distal tubular cells is demonstrated as a consequence of the nephrotoxic side effects of cytostatic treatment. With the help of monoclonal antibodies, it has now become possible to identify and to investigate the damage inflicted on the distal part of the tubule system in addition to the well-documented proximal tubular damage.\r"

  ".W": "Over an 18-year period, renal involvement was diagnosed in 13 patients, who represent 1% of the total juvenile chronic arthritis population referred to us. All had severe arthritis. This study illustrates the importance of renal biopsy and indicates that renal involvement in juvenile chronic arthritis is a heterogeneous group of diseases, with a variety of causes. In eight patients with nephrotic syndrome, renal biopsy revealed amyloidosis. One rapidly died of diffuse amyloidosis and infection. The other seven received chlorambucil. Disappearance of proteinuria was noted in three of them. Four patients have persistent proteinuria but normal serum creatinine. It is suggested that, despite the long-term oncogenic risk of the drug, chlorambucil may be beneficial in patients with amyloid deposits. In one patient, the nephrotic syndrome was attributed to systemic lupus erythematosus, and in another, the chance association of an arthritis and nephrotic syndrome with minimal glomerular changes was considered. Although drug responsibility is difficult to determine in these patients receiving several medications in association, the renal involvement presented by the remaining three patients was probably related to drug(s). Moreover, it is possible that the effect of the association of medications is deleterious to the kidney. Drug-induced nephropathy is usually reversible when drugs are stopped. Unfortunately, because of persistent joint pain, these patients will continue to require pain-relieving drugs over prolonged periods.\r"

A subsequent renal biopsy revealed membranous glomerulopathy due to systemic lupus erythematosus, as well as the unexpected finding of glomerulocystic kidney disease (GCKD), an uncommon disorder previously reported to occur primarily in infants and children. No evidence of renal dysplasia was present and no cysts were found in any abdominal or pelvic organs. Other than one bifid renal pelvis, no significant congenital anomalies or structural chromosomal abnormalities were present. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the patient's family revealed similar-appearing cortical cysts in several members, all of whom had no clinical evidence of renal dysfunction. The pattern of involvement was compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. Follow-up ultrasonograms of the patient and affected family members 1 year after the initial study showed enlargement of the cysts with development of additional cysts in two individuals and no change in the other family members. Although renal failure was present and progressed in our patient, renal function remained normal in all affected family members 1 year after detection of the renal cysts. This patient and her family provide additional insight into the inheritance and natural history of GCKD and demonstrate that this condition should be considered in the evaluation of multicystic renal disease in adults. In contrast to several previously reported cases, it appears that GCKD may be associated with normal renal function for many years.\r"

Renal survival was 47% at 6 months for patients with idiopathic rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and 33% for patients with antiglomerular basement membrane disease. Most patients in these two groups presented with advanced renal insufficiency. Renal survival rates for patients with systemic illness, with or without a tissue diagnosis of vasculitis, were 93% and 100%, respectively, at 1 year. These patients had better renal function at presentation. Overall, patient survival at 5 years was 61%, and there were no significant differences among the groups. A systematic analysis of clinical, immunopathologic, and laboratory variables showed that the initial serum creatinine level and oliguria and the patient's age and oliguria were the most important indicators of renal and patient survival, respectively. Virtually all patients with a creatinine level greater than 6.0 mg/dL lost their kidneys. Five-year survival for patients greater than 60 years old was 31%, compared with 83% for those less than or equal to 60 years. Moderate-to-severe tubulointerstitial inflammation indicated worse patient and renal survival, and 24-hour urine protein excretion greater than 3 g was related to shorter renal survival. We have identified and ranked a number of variables that affect patient or renal survival in crescentic glomerulonephritis. These findings may be of help in the decision-making process of patient management and analysis of treatment modalities.\r"

In all patients, serum magnesium rose and bicarbonate fell. Hormonal changes were as suspected: a further stimulation of renin and a decline in aldosterone. The BP sensitivity to angiotensin II normalized in the five patients in whom the test was performed. Clearance studies during maximal water diuresis, performed in four patients, were compatible with a high proximal fractional tubular sodium reabsorption and a relatively low distal fractional sodium reabsorption. Fractional free water excretion after furosemide was also low, confirming the concept of a primary sodium reabsorption defect in the furosemide-insensitive part of the nephron in Bartter's syndrome. The only consistent change after enalapril was a further decline in distal fractional sodium reabsorption. Initiation of therapy produced a BP fall in each subject. Clinical important hypotension associated with oliguria was seen twice, but these reactions were short-lasting. The BP rose to pretreatment values within 72 hours, despite continuation of converting-enzyme inhibition. Renal function recovered, though a moderate fall in function persisted. No other side effects were noticed. We conclude that converting-enzyme inhibition improves the potassium metabolism of patients with Bartter's syndrome, without ameliorating the abnormal renal sodium handling.\r"

Twelve children had previously received aluminum hydroxide, while calcium carbonate was the primary phosphate binder used in seven children. Among all the children, the serum phosphorus level on no phosphate binder was 7.4 +/- 0.9 mg/dL, which decreased significantly (P less than .001) to 5.9 +/- 0.8 mg/dL during calcium carbonate therapy, while the serum calcium, bicarbonate, and creatinine were unchanged. The reduction in the serum phosphorus level occurred while dietary intake of calcium and phosphorus were unchanged, as demonstrated by three-day dietary records. The dose of calcium carbonate required to maintain the serum phosphorus in the normal range varied from 600 mg to 15 g/d (mean 7.4 g/d). Among the 12 children and four others who had received aluminum hydroxide, serum aluminum levels fell from 108.8 +/- 121.8 ng/mL to 36.1 +/- 29.1 ng/mL after aluminum hydroxide was stopped (P less than .05). Serum alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels during aluminum hydroxide therapy were similar to levels obtained during calcium carbonate therapy, while PTH levels fell in children treated initially with calcium carbonate. All the children have been observed for a mean of 12.0 months (range 4 months to 3 1/2 years). Hypercalcemia occurred in seven children, usually when vitamin D therapy was initiated or the dose changed. Hypercalcemia resolved with adjustment of the vitamin D or calcium carbonate dose in all but one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Erythrocyte sodium increased from 7.5 +/- 0.3 to 8.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L cells with a mean of 1.1 +/- 0.1 mmol/L cells (P less than .001), but erythrocyte potassium and cellular water content were virtually unchanged. Plasma potassium decreased during dialysis from 4.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L (P less than .001). The increase in red-cell sodium correlated with this decrease in plasma potassium (r = .51, P less than .01). In contrast, erythrocyte sodium and potassium in undialyzed control patients with chronic renal failure did not change over a similar period, and plasma potassium was unchanged (4.3 +/- 0.1 mEq/L before and 4.3 +/- 0.2 mEq/L after 48 hours). Incubation of postdialysis erythrocytes from the dialysis patients in their own plasma at varying potassium concentrations showed that the rise in cell sodium was blunted as the plasma potassium was increased from 3.2 +/- 0.1 to 4.5 +/- 0.2 mEq/L. These results suggest that unlike hemodialysis, which is not associated with short-term changes in red-cell electrolytes, intermittent peritoneal dialysis results in a reversible increase in erythrocyte sodium. This change appears to be causally related to the decrease in extracellular potassium concentration.\r"

Hematocrit increase of 3 to 19 vol% was associated with correction of microcytosis, significant reduction in abnormal levels of free erythrocyte protoporphyrins, and amelioration of the bone-related symptoms and neurologic signs of aluminum intoxication. Increase in hematocrit, reversal of microcytosis, and reduction in protoporphyrin levels all correlated with the aluminum burden as indicated by the pretreatment serum aluminum levels and by the peak serum aluminum levels during mobilization with deferoxamine. Furthermore, deferoxamine resulted in marked improvement in anemia despite significant reduction in serum ferritin levels. This reversal of microcytosis with deferoxamine provides objective evidence verifying the toxicity of aluminum, and suggests that microcytosis may be an easily detected marker for both clinical diagnosis as well as response to treatment in some cases of aluminum intoxication.\r"

Renal biopsy demonstrated a proliferative glomerulonephritis; energy dispersive x-ray analysis detected silicon within the renal tubules. Measurements of respirable silica at the foundry revealed levels up to 2.5 times the current occupational standard. Similar glomerular disease has been reported in silica-exposed animals and workers with silicosis. This case suggests that clinicians should include silica exposure in the differential diagnosis of unexplained diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis, renal disease may occur without clinically evident pulmonary disease in silica exposure, and silica-induced glomerulonephritis warrants further clinical and epidemiologic research.\r"

  ".U": "87153396\r", 
  ".W": "An appreciation of the pathogenesis of the hypercalcemia of malignancy is essential to its management. At the outset, since most patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia of malignancy are dehydrated, infusion of 2 to 3 liters of saline per day will at least partially reduce serum calcium levels. Induction of calciuresis by infusing larger volumes of saline simultaneously with parenteral administration of furosemide may reduce the serum calcium concentration to normal in the short term. Of major importance in long-term therapy, however, are drugs that inhibit bone resorption, a major cause of hypercalcemia. These include calcitonin, plicamycin, glucocorticoids, prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors, and the diphosphonates. These agents may provide long-term control of hypercalcemia in many patients. Reduction of intestinal calcium absorption by dietary means or by glucocorticoid therapy is often effective in the rare subset of patients with increased serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Oral and intravenous phosphorus therapy may be effective via unknown mechanisms in some patients. The diphosphonates, in particular, should greatly facilitate management of both acute and chronic hypercalcemia of malignancy. Daily intravenous infusion of etidronate disodium (etidronate) with saline over a period of three to six days, for example, appears to be a safe and effective means of restoring serum calcium concentrations to the normal range. Study results have shown that more than 90 percent of patients have a response to etidronate. Oral administration of the drug has been demonstrated to maintain normal serum calcium concentrations.\r"

Their catheters had been in place for a mean of 33.2 days. When removed, 40.4 percent were blocked or showed poor flow. After the catheters were changed, the 14-day \"catheter life\" was 78 percent. About half the population had blocked catheters. They had a 14-day \"catheter life\" of only 31.8 percent (p = less than 0.01). Patients with blocked catheters (\"blockers\") excreted more alkaline urine, calcium, protein, and mucin than patients without blocked catheters (\"nonblockers\"), but urea-splitting bacteria were no more frequent. The mortality was not significantly different. Flow of water through catheters was closely related to extent of encrustations. Encrustations formed uniformly throughout the catheter lumen except when the tip was obstructed. The distribution and number of species of microorganisms (three and a half per specimen) were virtually identical in catheter and bladder urine, but the counts in the catheter urine were more frequently greater than 100,000 cfu/ml (p = less than 0.01). Patients with blocked catheters appear to be metabolically different from patients without blocked catheters and should have their catheters changed at seven to 10 days to avoid obstruction.\r"

Of the aspirates from 83 patients known to have systemic amyloid disease prior to the biopsy, 70 (84 percent) were found to yield positive results. The results for four aspirates from patients with localized amyloid disease were negative. Of the aspirates from 356 patients of unknown clinical status referred for analysis by outside physicians, 26 (7 percent) yielded positive results for amyloid. On review of the clinical records of these 26 patients, 11 had proved systemic amyloidosis demonstrated on biopsy of another site; all had a clinical course consistent with amyloid disease. In no case was amyloid found in a fat aspiration sample from a patient without clinical evidence suggestive of systemic amyloid disease. This study supports the proposal that abdominal fat aspiration is the diagnostic procedure of choice in the evaluation of amyloidosis since it requires no specialty consultation or technical expertise, causes minimal patient discomfort, and is accompanied by virtually no risk of morbid complication. A positive result has a high predictive value of amyloid disease in patients of unknown clinical status.\r"

A cohort of 2,046 initially healthy men in the Normative Aging Study was followed for 14.9 years with serial examinations and measurement of urate levels. With prior serum urate levels of 9 mg/dl or more, the annual incidence rate of gouty arthritis was 4.9 percent, compared with 0.5 percent for urate levels of 7.0 to 8.9 mg/dl and 0.1 percent for urate levels below 7.0 mg/dl. With urate levels of 9 mg/dl or higher, cumulative incidence of gouty arthritis reached 22 percent after five years. Incidence rates were three times higher for hypertensive patients than for normotensive patients (p less than 0.01). The strongest predictors of gout in a proportional hazards model were age, body mass index, hypertension, and cholesterol level, and alcohol intake. When the serum urate level became a factor in the model, none of these variables retained independent predictive power. At the final examination, only 0.7 percent of participants had a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dl or more, with no evidence of renal deterioration attributable to hyperuricemia. These data support conservative management of asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\r"

This may be the first documentation of several features of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine toxicity: morphologic changes in human peripheral nerve in chloroquine toxicity; chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine cardiomyopathy diagnosed by endomyocardial biopsy; and hydroxychloroquine myotoxicity. Chloroquine is a neuromyotoxin that affects nerves and cardiac and skeletal muscles. Discontinuation of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine resulted in marked improvement in most cases. The reversibility of the symptoms emphasizes the importance of recognizing potential signs of nerve, muscle, and cardiac toxicity in patients being treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.\r"

  ".W": "Forty-five American and English doctors were surveyed to determine whether differences in their beliefs about the incidence and morbidity of complications and the role of testing for patients with chronic hypertension could be contributing to the large cross-national differences previously demonstrated in ambulatory test use for such patients. For each of nine tests, the number the English doctors thought they \"should order\" was significantly less than that of the American group. English doctors also estimated a lower incidence for each of seven possible complications of hypertension, but there was no difference in perceived morbidity of the complications. Both groups thought results from testing would alter therapy for only a small proportion of patients; however, the English estimate was significantly smaller than the American (16 percent versus 27 percent: p less than 0.05). The reasons given for testing were very similar in the two countries except that American doctors ranked as more important the reason that patients used the quantity of test ordering as an indicator of quality care. These results suggest that differences in ambulatory test use are consistent with physicians' beliefs about the number of tests they should be ordering, disease incidence, the likelihood that testing will affect patient care, and patient expectations. Further study should be directed toward understanding the contributions that differences in physician beliefs about the natural histories of diseases and patient expectations make to variations in test ordering.\r"

To assess the clinical, histologic, and microbiologic correlates of intestinal spirochetosis in a high-risk group, rectal biopsy specimens from 130 homosexual men, 92 percent of whom had intestinal symptoms, were evaluated. All men were extensively evaluated for rectal and enteric pathogens. Intestinal spirochetosis was identified in rectal biopsy specimens from 39 (30 percent) men; 15 percent of biopsy specimens revealed intestinal spirochetosis on hematoxylin and eosin plus alcian blue staining, and positive results were found in 30 percent on silver staining. No rectal biopsy specimens from 79 control patients with a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms demonstrated evidence of spirochetosis on hematoxylin and eosin, alcian blue, or silver staining (p less than 0.0001). Fifty-six percent of rectal biopsy specimens from men with intestinal spirochetosis were normal, and no specific histologic abnormality was correlated with intestinal spirochetosis. There were no differences in the presence of or type of intestinal symptoms, sigmoidoscopic appearance of the mucosa, type of sexual practice, or prior antibiotic use in men with and without spirochetosis. Other intestinal pathogens were frequent in both groups, and only rectal gonorrhea was significantly associated with intestinal spirochetosis. It is concluded that homosexual men with intestinal symptoms have an increased prevalence of spirochetosis, often in association with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Independent association of spirochetosis with clinical or histologic findings could not be demonstrated.\r"

Measurement of serum properdin levels by radial immunodiffusion and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay revealed a profound deficiency in the patient, normal levels in the father, and half-normal levels in the mother, suggesting X-linked inheritance of the deficiency. Addition of purified properdin to the patient's serum fully reconstituted the alternative pathway function. This patient's unique combination of inherited deficiencies of properdin and C2 is a likely explanation for his susceptibility to bacterial infection.\r"

Twelve women with premenstrual syndrome and nine asymptomatic women were tested on four functional instruments at the menstrual, early follicular, early luteal, and late luteal phases. Two tests of a paper-and-pencil type measured perceptual parameters, and two tests involving manipulation of objects measured manual dexterity. Mean performance on the Crawford Small Parts Dexterity Test--Part II, which tests fine motor function, was better at the late luteal testing, compared to the early follicular testing, in asymptomatic women but was worse in the women with premenstrual syndrome. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.015). No significant differences between groups in performance changes were observed for the other functional tests. The Crawford Small Parts Dexterity Test-Part II is an objective measure that is potentially valuable in therapeutic trials involving patients with premenstrual syndrome.\r"

However, these levels are changing in a curvilinear fashion as pregnancy advances. Consequently the simple linear model does not provide a good fit to the data. To define more precisely the normal values for hCG increase, serial determinations were performed on serum samples obtained from 29 patients who were carrying normally advancing pregnancies. Gestational age was established with basal body temperature records. Three gestational age periods were identified each with a linear increase in hCG. This was translated into hCG doubling times and percentage increase over time. These tables may be used to determine if an early pregnancy is advancing normally.\r"

The mean titer for the recurrent abortion group was not significantly elevated, compared to controls. Women with blocked fallopian tubes had the highest prevalence of elevated titers (p less than 0.01) and the highest mean titer (p less than 0.001). Despite multiple testing, no women or men were chlamydia culture-positive. The lack of isolation among patients with antibody could be due to cryptic infection at a site not amenable to culture or to inhibition by secretory IgA. There could also be nonspecific stimulation of chlamydial antibody caused by other infections such as mycoplasma. The presence, though at a low level, of antibody in culture-negative patients suggests chlamydia may not be directly associated with recurrent abortion but reflect previous exposure to chlamydia or an altered immune system.\r"

Rates of cesarean section for dystocia were determined for each of the three time periods. An evening peak in the cesarean section rate is partially but not entirely explained by an evening increase in the proportion of patients in prolonged labor. When patients were stratified according to labor duration (less than 12, 12 to 15, and greater than 16 hours), a persistent evening excess in the rate of cesarean section for dystocia was observed for patients whose labor duration was less than 16 hours. Although this is interpreted as being consistent with the hypothesis of physician convenience, the magnitude of this effect on the overall rate of cesarean section for dystocia is small.\r"

Patients with cyanotic lesions developed significantly more congestive heart failure and deteriorated more often in functional cardiac status than those with acyanotic lesions (p less than 0.005). Women with obstructive lesions had a higher incidence of pregnancy-induced hypertension than our general population (p less than 0.005).

Preterm births were more frequent in the cyanotic group (p less than 0.01) as were small for gestational age infants (p less than 0.005). In the cyanotic group the mean birth weight was 900 gm less than that in the acyanotic group (p less than 0.005). The major benefits of corrective cardiac surgery were in the cyanotic group and consisted of fewer spontaneous abortions (p less than 0.01) and small for gestational age infants (p less than 0.02) and more term births (p less than 0.01). Long-term follow-up revealed that 19.2% of women with acyanotic lesions had significant cardiac developments, compared with 90% in the cyanotic group (p less than 0.005). One of 87 infants (1.1%) had congenital heart disease and two had Marfan's syndrome.\r"

There was an immediate significant increase in the basal heart rate, which persisted for 1 hour after the stimulus, compared to that of the control subjects. There was also a significant increase in the total time during which accelerations occurred for the first 20 minutes after the stimulus. There were no changes in computer-derived indices of fetal heart rate variability. Maternal blood pressure and heart rate were not altered following vibratory acoustic stimulus. We hypothesize that external vibratory acoustic stimulus causes a change from a state of sleep to a state of wakefulness in near term healthy fetuses.\r"

Initial interviews determined the basic demographic data, the reasons for delaying pregnancy, attitudes to pregnancy, and plans concerning careers. Psychological tests were given to measure anxiety, depression, anger, marital intimacy, sense of autonomy, and role expectations. These psychological tests were applied to all patients at 12 to 16 weeks' gestation and again at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation. The demographic information from the two groups was remarkably similar. Although their ages differed by 10 years, their career goals, their family incomes, reasons for delaying pregnancy, and reasons for now getting pregnant revealed minimal differences. The Maffer Feminine Identity Scale revealed that the younger women held more traditional attitudes toward a woman's roles than the older group. The Sociotrophy-Autonomy Scale indicated that the older women were more independent than the younger pregnant patients. The Symptom Checklist indicated that the older group were less troubled by pregnancy than the control group, and although their level of distress increased as the pregnancy progressed, they remained better adjusted as they entered the last trimester of their pregnancies.\r"

Blood flow to the organs was redistributed, and although it was increased to the lungs, kidneys, liver, and adrenals, it was significantly reduced to the spleen, stomach, placentas, cecum, large intestine, and pancreas. The effect of hydralazine on placental perfusion was opposite to the effect on the uterus (myometrium). Patients with the highest blood pressures tend to have the poorest placental perfusion. Intravenous hydralazine should be used cautiously in these patients.\r"

Comparisons with similar data from fetal lambs in utero and during labor and delivery indicate that extraction in the human and sheep fetus is 47% and 27%, respectively, at PaO2 = 20 mm Hg. For the human fetus to have extraction similar to that in the fetal lamb, vascular PO2 would have to be substantially higher. This would lead to a higher umbilical venous oxygen content in the human, compensating for the lower umbilical blood flow and yielding a rate of oxygen delivery comparable with that observed in the fetal sheep. These data indicate that there may be significant quantitative differences in the fetal oxygen delivery systems in the human and sheep.\r"

Two patients had permanent hair loss after healing.

Overall, in patients with chorioamnionitis, the perinatal death rate was higher (p less than 0.01); more stillbirths occurred compared with early neonatal deaths (p less than 0.05), and there was a higher incidence of deaths with no defined cause (p less than 0.01) compared with cases without chorioamnionitis. Ureaplasma urealyticum or pathogenic bacteria were isolated more frequently from villous tissue of placentas from cases with chorioamnionitis (p less than 0.01) but not Mycoplasma hominis, Chlamydia trachomatis, or viruses. Furthermore, there was a higher prevalence of both elevated fetal antibody titer to U. urealyticum (p less than 0.025) and fetal titer fourfold above maternal titers (p less than 0.05) in cases with chorioamnionitis. The antibody responses and presence of microorganisms suggest that chorioamnionitis is associated with intrauterine infection and an associated increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality.\r"

Amniotic fluid was obtained at amniocentesis in 24 women (mean duration of amenorrhea 15.9 +/- 0.2 week). Hormones were measured by specific radioimmunoassay. The concentrations (mean +/- SEM) of human chorionic gonadotropin in molar fluid and amniotic fluid were 581,829 +/- 112,581 and 3187 +/- 505 mlU/ml (p less than 0.001), respectively. For prolactin the levels in molar fluid and amniotic fluid were 44 +/- 24 and 1962 +/- 313 ng/ml (p less than 0.001), respectively. These data demonstrate that molar fluid contains 182-fold higher levels of human chorionic gonadotropin and 45-fold lower levels of prolactin than amniotic fluid obtained from normal pregnant women with a similar duration of amenorrhea. In addition to altered endocrine function of the trophoblast, there may be altered prolactin secretion from the decidua in molar pregnancy as compared with normal pregnancy. Further research is required to evaluate prolactin production from decidua of molar pregnancy.\r"

There were no between-group differences in total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, or low-density lipoprotein values. Neither was the low-density/high-density lipoprotein ratio significantly different between groups at any of the test times.

The intracellular concentration of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate was elevated by (1) addition of an adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate analogue, 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, (2) inhibition of the hydrolysis of Gs-GTP complex by cholera toxin, and (3) direct stimulation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. Addition of 2 mmol/L of 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate markedly increased the accumulation of human chorionic gonadotropin in the culture medium on days 2, 3, and 4 of treatment. Likewise, addition of cholera toxin (0.2 microgram/ml) or forskolin (50 mumol/L) also enhanced human chorionic gonadotropin production. On the other hand, the production of estradiol-17 beta was significantly inhibited by 8-bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate, at the same time that human chorionic gonadotropin production was enhanced in the same experiments. These results further support a differential role of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate on human chorionic gonadotropin and estradiol-17 beta production in the human term placenta.\r"

No significant difference was found in plasma progesterone concentrations between the two groups. These results, in conjunction with other calculated estrogenic indices based on these patients, provide no evidence of lack of progesterone at the onset of clinical disease. However, the effects of long-term progesterone lack related to chronic anovulation are not excluded by these findings.\r"

The lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and lysolecithin were all analyzed to determine the effect of vaginal contamination. With the use of a paired t test, only lysolecithin was shown to be significantly affected by vaginal contamination (p less than 0.05). As determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, evaluation of phospholipids in vaginal fluid of patients with premature rupture of the membranes appears to be an accurate and reliable method for predicting fetal lung maturity.\r"

Immunoelectron microscopy by means of the protein A-gold technique reveals localization of the immunoreactive gold particles in two kinds of membrane-bound granular inclusions in this cell; one type is granules of 200 to 300 nm in diameter with moderate electron density and the other is large electron-dense bodies of 500 to 1000 nm. The former seems to be Golgi-derived secretory granules that play a role in the release of human chorionic gonadotropin from the syncytiotrophoblast. Although the origin of the latter is still uncertain, a certain amount of this hormone might be stored or treated by lysosomal digestion in the large bodies during these stages.\r"

The highest surgical infectious morbidity, 22%, occurred in patients admitted for cervical cancer.

These serious polymicrobial infections dictate intelligent selection of antimicrobials and appropriate monitoring to anticipate complications inherent in antimicrobial therapy. beta-Lactamase induction, superinfection, nephrotoxicity, and necrotizing enterocolitis are documented problems in these patients.\r"

The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of ambulatory tocodynamometry in the early identification of preterm labor. In this investigation 67 women at risk for preterm labor were randomly divided into two groups: 34 received a uterine activity monitor while 33 patients used palpation. Approximately two thirds of the study sample developed preterm labor. Upon diagnosis of preterm labor, parturients in the control group had cervical dilatation of less than 3 cm (p less than 0.001) and effacement of greater than 50% more often than the monitored group (p less than 0.01). As a result there was a significant decrease in the number of patients who responded to tocolytic therapy in the unmonitored group. Among those with preterm labor the time gained in utero was greater in the monitored group (8.2 +/- 2.7 weeks) compared to the control group (4.2 +/- 2.9 weeks) (p less than 0.05). Subsequently 29 of 34 monitored patients attained term (36 completed gestational weeks) versus only 18 of the 33 patients in the unmonitored group (p less than 0.01). Although the sample size is relatively small, uterine activity monitoring in these very high risk patients resulted in an increased number of suitable candidates for tocolysis and allowed a significantly greater percentage of women to reach term.\r"

Fetal body movements did not stimulate contractions, but contractions coincided with a specific clustering of body movements during the ascending part of contractions. Breathing was clustered during the descending part of short-lasting contractions but decreased gradually during the long-lasting ones. Heart rate variation was increased during contractions.\r"

It is concluded that hysterosalpingography is an important screening procedure for the diagnosis of normal or abnormal uterine cavities and that hysteroscopy should be reserved only for the confirmation and treatment of intrauterine anomalies discovered by hysterosalpingography.

Twelve exercising women were randomly allocated to groups of either oral contraceptive users or non-oral contraceptive users. When compared with results in the control group, maximal oxygen uptake (ml/kg1 X min1) decreased significantly in the oral contraceptive users during the 6-month period of observation. This was associated with an 8% decrease in both the oxygen uptake (2.34 to 2.17 L/min) and the oxygen pulse (12.1 +/- 3.2 to 11.2 +/- 2.2 ml/beat). The serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein/cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein subfractions 2a and 2b levels were not altered. A significant increase in plasminogen activity was found in the oral contraceptive users: values increased from a coherent time average of 3.8 +/- 0.5 U/ml at baseline to 5.7 +/- 0.7 U/ml at 6 months; values returned to baseline levels 1 month after stopping the oral contraceptives (coherent time average of 3.9 +/- 0.6 U/ml; p less than 0.0001).

Low-dose oral contraceptive usage is associated with a decrease in functional aerobic capacity, but it does not impinge on the hemostatic mechanism or lipid-lipoprotein metabolism.\r"

  ".W": "The classification systems developed over 20 years ago by White and Pedersen identified diabetic pregnancies at increased risk for perinatal mortality. To assess whether these same criteria would currently be valid, 199 diabetic pregnancies with deliveries from 1977 to 1983 were reviewed. Perinatal mortality rates for White's Classes B gestational (n = 72), B (n = 27), C (n = 67), and D + F + R (n = 33) were 2.9%, 11.1%, 14.9%, and 21.1%, respectively (p less than 0.05). White's classes were also predictive of pulmonary morbidity (12.5%, 18.5%, 22.4%, and 42.4%, respectively). The presence of one or more of the prognostically bad signs of pregnancy (n = 76) increased the perinatal mortality rate to 17.1% versus 7.3% among insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies without prognostically bad signs (p less than 0.05). The presence of any prognostically bad signs of pregnancy was also predictive of pulmonary morbidity in general (31.6% versus 16.3%, respectively) and hyaline membrane disease in particular (13.2% versus 4.1%, respectively). Thus with use of modern obstetric management and medical care of the pregnant diabetic patient, both White's classification and Pedersen's prognostically bad signs of pregnancy continue to be predictive of perinatal mortality.\r"

The overall death rate resulting from legal abortion dropped nearly fivefold, from 4.1 per 100,000 abortions in 1972 to 0.8 in 1982. Women who were older, black, of high parity, and had abortions at a later gestational age were at increased risk of death throughout the 11 years of surveillance. During this period, the death rate decreased for abortions at all stages of gestation; the greatest decrease was with abortions performed during the second trimester. For the entire interval, mortality rates were highest for abortions performed by hysterotomy or hysterectomy and lowest for abortions performed by curettage. Before 1977, the most common causes of abortion-related death were infection, hemorrhage, and general anesthesia complications, respectively. Thereafter, hemorrhage became the most common cause of abortion-related death, followed in number by general anesthesia complications. Our findings suggest that there has been a marked decrease in septic legal abortion deaths, but potentially preventable deaths from general anesthesia and hemorrhage remain an important concern. Use of general anesthetics during first-trimester abortions should be carefully reviewed.\r"

Cumulative rates of dying from cervical cancer equate improved survival in terms of differences in prognosis and in effectiveness of treatment. Long-term observations bring into focus interval changes affecting the reservoir of individuals remaining at risk, which is maintained in accordance with rates of new patient inflow, as well as withdrawal for all categories of attrition. The several factors determining that balance, including age at diagnosis of cervical cancer, do not fall equally on all clinical stages. Age, a dominant factor determining incidence of second primary malignancies, may also have significance in unraveling the obscure etiology of corporeal malignancies evolving among patients irradiated in the treatment of cervical cancer.\r"

Patients with the latter two categories and those with persistent inflammatory atypia after specific therapy underwent colposcopy and directed biopsies if indicated. Colposcopically directed biopsies revealed that 29% of patients with atypical Papanicolaou smears had underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of underlying cervical intraepithelial neoplasia among patients in each of the three categories of atypia. Of those with intraepithelial neoplasia, 35% had lesions of greater severity than grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. We conclude that all patients with squamous, endocervical, and persistent inflammatory atypia on Papanicolaou smear should undergo colposcopic evaluation to rule out intraepithelial neoplasia.\r"

The favorable effect of tocolysis on fetal homeostasis is attributed to the suppression of the ischemic effect of contractions on the placental circulation. The few fetuses having an extremely compromised placental function showed no improvement in heart rate or acidosis with tocolysis and were immediately delivered. Considering the mild side effects observed, the lack of maternal complications, and the remarkable perinatal outcome obtained, we recommend using tocolysis before delivering distressed fetuses.\r"

A highly significant increase was noted in the incidence of abnormal labor and operative delivery in group A primigravid women (symphysis-fundus height above the ninetieth centile), which was even more pronounced when the effect of epidural analgesia was excluded. Conversely, there was a significant progressive increase in the proportion of operative deliveries for fetal distress from group A through group D (symphysis-fundus height below the tenth centile). Similar trends were significant but less pronounced among multigravid women. The relationship between maternal height, symphysis-fundus height, and operative delivery for dystocia in primigravid women was examined. High operative delivery rates were present in group A primigravid patients regardless of maternal height. In groups B and C, however, increased maternal height was associated with lower operative delivery rates.\r"

The mean obesity index was 127 in eight cases and 116 in 12 cases. Seven of these eight cases were pure tubular adenocarcinoma. From the standpoint of early myometrial infiltration of the endometrial cancer, these eight cases not only provided a good model to survey early endometrial cancer but also suggested a common stimulus, such as estrogen, in both endometrial cancer and uterine adenomyosis.\r"

All these hormones were significantly lower than in normal pregnancy. Unruptured ectopic pregnancy differed from the ruptured state by a lower serum human chorionic gonadotropin concentration, a slower human chorionic gonadotropin increment, a higher incidence of metrorrhagia, and an earlier diagnosis. The concentration of estradiol, progesterone, and 17-hydroxyprogesterone in the serum of patients with ectopic pregnancy was lower than could be expected from the decrease of human chorionic gonadotropin, often lower than in a normal luteal phase. It is suggested that, as long as ultrasonography fails to show an intrauterine pregnancy, the simultaneous determination of serum human chorionic gonadotropin and progesterone could aid in the early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and in the improvement of subsequent fertility; to that regard any progesterone level below 15 ng/ml in the presence of detectable amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin is highly suggestive of either a threatened abortion or an ectopic pregnancy, whatever the gestational age.\r"

The conditions necessary for successful measurements are described. The intensity of the cervical electromyographic activity was found to decrease with the level of cervical ripeness and with parity. When measured in the longitudinal direction, the cervical electromyographic activity resembled that of the uterine corpus, but when picked up from the circular lead, in a few cases of unripe cervices it differed from the electromyographic activity of the uterine corpus.\r"

Antigen was used at a concentration of 10 micrograms of protein per milliliter, sera were diluted 1:200, and conjugates were diluted 1:500. Agreement between cultured isolation of M. hominis from the lower genital tract and presence of antibody in 207 women was 71%, 82%, and 86% for IgG, IgM, and IgA, respectively. When the ELISA was compared with the mycoplasmacidal assay, an overall agreement of 81% occurred, with the majority of the discrepancies occurring in the ELISA-positive and mycoplasmacidal-negative category. A linear relationship between end point titer and the A400 value (ELISA or absorbance value at 400 nm) at a standard serum dilution was demonstrated for the IgG, IgM, and IgA classes. Although the ELISA was relatively independent of antigen heterogeneity, no single strain detected more than 87% of positive sera, thus suggesting that optimum detection of antibody to M. hominis by the ELISA will require use of antigen pools derived from multiple strains of M. hominis.\r"

Tissues were collected at laparotomy for ectopic pregnancy (five embryos) or after spontaneous (seven) or prostaglandin-induced (four) abortion. beta-Endorphin and beta-lipotropin were present starting at the seventh week of pregnancy while gamma-endorphin appeared only in the second trimester. During embryonic life opioid activity was limited to the cephalic portion. The three peptides, but little, if any, acetylated 1-31 beta-endorphin, were recognized in the fetal pituitary throughout the second trimester, at which time beta-lipotropin and beta-endorphin showed constant values in spite of increasing gamma-endorphin concentrations. beta-Lipotropin was the predominant peptide in both embryonic and fetal life. In conclusion, the three peptides related to proopiomelanocortin were expressed from the precursor at different times throughout development. By the beginning of the second trimester the pituitary processing of proopiomelanocortin is similar to that of adult life and the functional activity of the anterior lobe seems to prevail over that of the \"fetus-related\" neurointermediate lobe around the twenty-fifth week of pregnancy.\r"

  ".W": "We measured regional blood flows and cardiac output and calculated regional oxygen deliveries (blood flow X arterial blood oxygen concentration) and systemic oxygen delivery, oxygen extraction, and oxygen consumption as maternal hematocrit was varied randomly between 31% and 8% by exchange transfusion with plasma or packed sheep red blood cells. We observed three patterns of response: In the heart, brain, and adrenal glands, oxygen delivery was constant or nearly constant over the range of hematocrits studied; in the kidneys, splanchnic organs, and uteroplacental tissues, oxygen delivery was a linear function of hematocrit; in the carcass tissues, oxygen delivery decreased slowly as hematocrits were reduced from 31% to 15% and dropped rapidly at hematocrits less than or equal to 15%. Systemic oxygen consumption was maintained at normal levels, despite reductions in hematocrit to about 15%, because oxygen extraction increased as compensation. At lower hematocrits, systemic oxygen consumption fell in association with a metabolic acidemia, suggesting that, with this severity of acute anemia, oxygen supply to some tissues in the pregnant sheep was inadequate for tissue metabolic demands.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether prolonged exposure to ritodrine results in down-regulation of myocardial adenylate cyclase activity during pregnancy, New Zealand White rabbits with time-dated pregnancies were randomly assigned to a sham-operated control group and to a ritodrine-treated group. Starting at 22 days' gestation (term 31 days), animals received either intravenous ritodrine intermittently or the equivalent volume of vehicle for 3 days. Adenylate cyclase activity was determined in a plasma membrane fraction obtained from ventricular tissue. There was no difference in the basal activity or the basal and guanosine triphosphate activity between the two groups. L-Isoproterenol-dependent stimulation required the presence of guanosine triphosphate. Both maximal and 50% enzymatic stimulation were equivalent in both groups. Furthermore, sodium fluoride-dependent stimulation was similar in both groups. Finally, adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of forskolin and manganese chloride was similar in both groups. From the above, we conclude that intermittent systemic infusions of ritodrine to pregnant rabbits did not result in down-regulation of myocardial adenylate cyclase activity.\r"

Ophthalmoscopically, these light retinopathy lesions appeared as a focal pigment epithelial change with varying degrees of pigment clumping in the center. Fluorescein angiography accentuated the lesion by demonstrating a sharply demarcated transmission defect, occasionally with multiple satellite lesions. The shape of the lesion matched the shape of the illuminating source of the particular operating microscope used during the surgery. The most significant risk factor associated with the production of these light retinopathy lesions was prolonged operating time. Mean total operating time for the ten patients with light retinopathy was 51 minutes longer than for those without (P less than .0001). Other significant associated factors were the presence of diabetes mellitus (P less than .03), younger age (P less than .05), and the use of hydrochlorothiazide (P less than .04).\r"

We obtained the best optical result by centering the surgical procedure on the line of sight and entrance pupil of the eye, not on the visual axis. We found an error of 0.5 to 0.8 mm in currently used methods of marking the visual axis, which arose from the use of the corneal light reflex as a sighting point or from inadvertent monocular sighting in techniques requiring binocular sighting. Proper centering requires the patient to fixate on a point that is coaxial with the surgeon's sighting eye, and the cornea is marked at the point in line with the center of the patient's entrance pupil, ignoring the corneal light reflex.\r"

Postoperatively, a restoration of clear media and an improvement in visual acuity occurred in all cases. Visual acuity was 20/20 or better postoperatively in 15 of 24 cases, and 22 of 24 achieved 20/30 or better. The remaining two cases improved to 20/40 and 20/50 from a preoperative level of 20/200 and 20/400, respectively. In carefully selected cases vitrectomy techniques provide an effective means of managing this syndrome.\r"

A similar dose was given two to three times per week for the next six months and tapered off or discontinued thereafter. The follow-up period varied from one to four years. Two patients have had no recurrence of tumor. The other three patients have had recurrences of lesser severity upon tapering or discontinuing the interferon, and repeat surgical or laser excision of these lesions has been performed. The presence of koilocytosis and human papillomavirus type 11a DNA sequences was noted in all specimens large enough to examine, whereas papillomavirus structural antigens were detected in only two of five specimens. A regimen of interferon therapy appears to be tumor suppressive, but not curative.\r"

This method differs from previously reported methods of diabetic membrane dissection by utilizing the posterior hyaloid to lift and immobilize the membrane as the membrane is excised with horizontally cutting scissors. The preservation of the posterior hyaloid facilitates the separation of the membrane from the retina. Fibrovascular proliferation was more completely removed and bleeding was less than with membrane sectioning techniques. The major surgical complication was posterior retinal break (seven eyes), but with near complete relief of traction all breaks were successfully treated with gas tamponade and laser photocoagulation. Thirteen retinas were completely reattached with a minimum follow-up of four months. One eye developed an extramacular tractional retinal detachment, and two eyes developed peripheral (retrolenticular) fibrovascular proliferation. Eleven eyes had 5/200 or better visual acuity.\r"

There was also a significant correlation between the number of focal constrictions and a diagnosis of severe preeclampsia (r = .34, P = .005). The arteriole to vein ratio and number of focal constrictions did not differ significantly between normal and mild preeclamptic patients. None of the patients showed background changes of hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and exudates, or evidence of choroidal ischemia (including Elschnig's spots and retinal detachment).

Treatment with ganciclovir (dihydroxy propoxymethyl guanine), a new antiviral medication related to acyclovir, resulted in regression of retinitis in all five patients treated with this drug.

Of 229 eyes, 172 (75%) were within 3 diopters of emmetropia after surgery. Of 259 eyes, 245 (95%) demonstrated improved uncorrected visual acuity; 138 (53%) improved by four or more Snellen lines. Of 265 eyes, 209 (78%) achieved within two lines or improved their best corrected visual acuity. Of the 119 patients who achieved or improved their preoperative best corrected visual acuity, 110 (92%) were within two Snellen lines or better by 30 to 60 days after suture removal. Of the 127 patients with more than three months of follow-up after suture removal, 124 (98%) of those between 18 and 70 years of age but only 13 of 23 (54%) of those between 81 and 87 years of age achieved within two lines or better of their best corrected visual acuity. Corneal astigmatism measured by keratometry changed from a preoperative mean (+/- S.D.) of 2.1 +/- 1.8 diopters to a postoperative mean of 2.7 +/- 2.6 diopters.

  ".W": "In the nationwide study of epikeratophakia, 97 surgeons performed a total of 335 procedures in 314 eyes for the correction of aphakia in children under the age of 8 years 1 month. Fifteen children underwent bilateral surgery. Thirty-six tissue lenses were removed and 21 of these eyes underwent a second epikeratophakia procedure. Overall, the success rate for procedures was 89%, and with repeated surgery it was 95% for eyes. Seventy-three percent of the patients were within 3 diopters of emmetropia after surgery. Visual acuity results in patients able to provide verbal responses to the illiterate E, Allen card, or Snellen line chart testing showed improvement in most cases. The safety of epikeratophakia makes it a desirable option for the correction of aphakia in children who are spectacle or contact-lens intolerant, and the permanence of the correction eliminates the problem of optical noncompliance.\r"

Preoperative and postoperative uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity and endothelial cell counts, as well as power predictability and complications rates, were compared. Preliminary results indicated that postoperative visual acuity, power predictability, and endothelial cell counts were comparable for the two groups. There were, however, fewer sight threatening complications associated with epikeratophakia, and complications in these patients were successfully reversed by removal and replacement of the lenticule.\r"

The 11-month-old incisions demonstrated morphologic features consistent with incomplete wound healing, whereas the incisions examined 66 and 70 months postoperatively demonstrated complete wound healing. A different lectin binding pattern of wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin-A was observed in the 11-month-old wounds, compared with the 66-month-old wounds.

The walls and the floor of the surgical site were rough with undulations greater than 10 micron in size, caused by broken lamellae and ruptured cells. In contrast, the surfaces produced by the excimer laser were smooth with perturbations of 1 micron or less and were sealed with a pseudomembrane. This smooth, sealed surface produced by the laser is probably responsible for the transparency of the healed cornea in contrast to the scarring produced when a conventional surgical keratotomy heals.\r"

At 4 days, before the onset of proteinuria, the principal change was extensive replacement of podocytic foot processes by broad expanses of epithelial cytoplasm. At 5 days, when proteinuria had developed, the epithelial cells showed in addition multiple cytoplasmic droplets, many large balloon like vacuoles, some of which were ruptured, and many foci of epithelial detachment from the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Of particular significance, the onset of proteinuria coincided precisely with the development of areas of epithelial detachment that led to direct continuity between externally denuded GBM and the urinary space. It seems likely that these areas are the primary sites of protein leakage across the GBM in this experimental model.\r"

  ".U": "87153737\r", 
  ".W": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes can produce active oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide under various conditions. Because these substances can be toxic to cells, it is possible that the interaction between the circulating leukocytes and the blood vessel wall, either in normal circulation or during the acute inflammatory response, could damage the endothelial lining. Using an in vitro system of cultured endothelial cells and isolated polymorphonuclear leukocytes, we have measured the levels of detectable superoxide when neutrophils are attached to either endothelial monolayers or to plastic. Our results show that the levels of superoxide, on a per-cell basis, are lower when the neutrophils are attached to endothelium than when attached to plastic, even if the neutrophils are stimulated with phorbol myristate acetate. This is also reflected in data showing that no injury occurs to the endothelial cells, as measured by 51Cr release, under these same conditions. When endothelial cells are pretreated with an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase, diethyldithiocarbamate, the levels of superoxide detected are the same for neutrophils stimulated on plastic and those on the endothelial monolayer, suggesting that endothelial superoxide dismutase may remove a portion of the neutrophil-generated superoxide from the detection system. Further evidence for the role of endothelium in destroying superoxide is suggested by results that show that the level of detectable superoxide released from neutrophils attached to formalin-fixed endothelial monolayers is the same as that for neutrophils attached to plastic. It is important to note that with the inhibitor of superoxide dismutase present, the endothelial monolayers do not display enhanced 51Cr release under the conditions employed. When both endothelial catalase and glutathione reductase are inhibited, we detect increased 51Cr release from endothelial cells in response to stimulated neutrophils. Our results show that the endothelial cells are important in affecting the apparent reduction of toxic oxygen products derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes attached to their surface.\r"

The autoantibodies occurred in mice with the corresponding endogenous antigens. Thus, anti-oocyte/zona antibodies were detected in female, anti-TSDA antibodies in male, and anti-parietal cell antibodies in both sexes. Anti-oocyte/zona antibodies were first detected at age 5-6 weeks and were absent by 25 weeks. Serum antizona antibodies, but not anti-oocyte antibodies, inhibited mouse fertilization in vitro. In contrast, antibodies to sperm acrosome and antibodies to sperm surface did not correlate with testicular or epididymal disease. Moreover, both male and female mice had increased levels of anti-sperm surface antibodies, indicating that the sperm antigens detected may not be organ-specific. In addition, sera from 5-10% of D3TX mice reacted with a wide spectrum of epididymal and testicular antigens with defined cellular locations but of yet unknown specificity. Although the incidence of antibodies to cytoskeletal antigens was not significantly elevated after D3TX, anti-nuclear antibodies were more frequently detected in (SWR/J X A/J) F1 (SWRAF1) and (C57 BL/6J X A/J) F1 (B6AF1) mice after D3TX.\r"

Three weeks after surgery serum creatinine was greater in the RK than either sham-operation controls (SHAM) or spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Blood pressure was higher in the RK (181 +/- 26 mm Hg) than in SHAM (129 +/- 17, P less than 0.05) but not SHR (195 +/- 15, P less than 0.05). GEC endocytosis, assessed by protamine heparin aggregate (PHA) disappearance (10), was not different from that in SHAM. Glomerular damage was greater in RK (glomerular damage index, 30 +/- 18) than in SHAM animals (4 +/- 3, P less than 0.05) and SHR (0, P less than 0.05), and 2 of 11 RK animals had fibrinoid necrosis and thrombosis of arterioles and glomeruli. Segmental sclerosis occurred in only 1 RK animal (0.6% of glomeruli). Six weeks after surgery serum creatinine and urinary protein excretion remained higher in the RK than in the SHAM animals. Blood pressure was higher in RK (158 +/- 34 mm Hg) than in SHAM animals (144 +/- 24), but the difference was not significant. PHA disappeared from the glomerulus at a slower rate in RK than in SHAM animals (outside the 95% confidence limits of SHAM). Glomerular pathology was more widespread in RK than in SHAM animals (glomerular damage index, 73 +/- 62 versus 3 +/- 8, P less than 0.05), and 4 of 11 animals had acute hypertensive injury in arterioles and glomeruli. Segmental glomerular sclerosis was only seen in the animals with necrotic glomeruli. GEC dysfunction is not demonstrable until long after proteinuria and hypertension are established, and it only occurs in the context of severe, acute glomerular injury when the epithelial cells separate from the capillary wall and undergo severe degenerative changes and necrosis. The acute glomerular and vascular lesions in the RK model are morphologically similar to malignant nephrosclerosis in humans. Segmental glomerular sclerosis occurs only after proteinuria is well established in the context of severe glomerular injury, and it appears to represent, at least partially, progression of more proximate glomerular capillary injury.\r"

PMCs phagocytized both CH and CR. Mild vacuolar cytoplasmic changes by LM and a few small surface blebbings by SEM were present, mainly in cells treated with CH. Metaphase chromosomes were well separated and retained surface details by SEM in the control group. Chromosomes were frequently entangled with, adherent to, and severed or pierced by long and thin curvilinear CH with occasional chromatin fibers threading over the partly severed asbestos. Similar chromosomal changes were much less frequently found in CR-treated cells; TEM confirmed the same findings. CH and CR have different physicochemical properties and also appear to have direct, intricate, but different interactions with chromosomes, as well as the cytoplasm, of PMCs.\r"

  ".U": "87153746\r", 
  ".W": "Alpha-hemolysin (AH) is a 110,000-dalton protein secreted extracellularly by certain Escherichia coli. This protein is an acknowledged virulence factor for E coli and recently has been implicated as an important determinant in the pathogenesis of E coli pyelonephritis. Recombinant engineered strains of E coli were used that varied only in their ability to secrete AH extracellularly. The effect of AH on vital dye exclusion, oxygen consumption rate (QO2) adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels, superoxide (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production in preparations of isolated rat cortical renal tubular cells (RTCs) was assessed. Approximately 5-10 pg of AH dramatically stimulated QO2 by nearly 150%. This was associated with a marked increase in production of O2- and H2O2, to 13.9 +/- 1.7 and 13.2 +/- 2.1 nM/mg cell protein, respectively (P less than 0.05), as well as a 38% decrease in cellular ATP. These biochemical effects were all seen after a 30-minute exposure to AH and by 120 minutes were associated with 15.7% +/- 1.1% of RTCs that were unable to exclude vital dye. The effect of AH on QO2 and O2- formation was prevented by pretreatment of RTCs with ouabain, which indicates that the effect of AH on oxygen metabolism is linked to Na-K ATPase activity. However, when ouabain-treated RTCs were exposed to AH, ATP remained depressed despite the inhibition of QO2 and O2- production. In contrast, in ouabain-pretreated RTCs, cell membrane integrity was dramatically protected, because only 2.4% +/- 0.4% of RTCs were not unable to exclude vital dye. Thus, the data demonstrate that E coli AH provokes at least two biochemical events that may be injurious to RTC: increased oxygen intermediates (O2- and H2O2 and ATP depletion. These findings with ouabain suggest that the first mechanism of injury may be a more proximate cause of cell death. Moreover, the data suggest that endogenous production of reactive oxygen molecules may be critical modulators of RTC membrane injury.\r"

The more severe pneumonia observed in the 4-IP-treated animals was associated with higher pulmonary viral titers and a more diffuse distribution of viral antigen in bronchioles and alveolar parenchyma. There was no difference in the systemic humoral immune response against Sendai virus or pulmonary interferon production in animals that had received 4-IP or vehicle pretreatment. Classification of the antigen-positive cell types in the alveolar parenchyma resulted in a marked relative increase in the numbers of antigen-positive macrophages, as compared with other antigen-positive cell types.\r"

Animals receiving selenium supplementation of Adriamycin showed preservation of the normal pattern of the heart histologic picture. The protective effect of selenium was accompanied by increased selenium levels in the plasma and the heart muscle. An eventual interaction between the antitumor effect of Adriamycin and the protective effect of selenium was ruled out by in vitro experiments using the L1210 cell line. Selenium did not abrogate the antiproliferative effect of Adriamycin when the cells were treated simultaneously with both agents. The results from this study indicate that Adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity could be prevented by selenium if the animals were pretreated with selenium, rather than simultaneous administration of both agents. The mechanism of this effect is not entirely understood.\r"

Lower viral doses (greater than 10(2) PFU) induced severe myocarditis in male mice but caused little injury in females. With 10(7) PFU, females also developed severe disease. Females may be relatively resistant to CVB3-induced myocarditis because virus entry into the blood and heart is less effective. Males given 125I-CVB3 show approximately 2-4 and 20-fold more radioactivity in the peripheral blood and heart, respectively, than females. No differences were observed between the sexes in 125I-bovine serum albumin penetration. Sex steroid hormones influence viremia and virus localization; females given exogenous testosterone and progesterone demonstrate ten times more virus in their hearts than animals given estradiol. The hormones may act by increasing virus receptor expression on endothelial cells and myocytes.\r"

Necrosis was responsible for minor cell loss during the first 24 hours, but most of the acinar cells were deleted by apoptosis. This distinctive form of cell death, which has been implicated in atrophy of other tissues, was characterized by cellular condensation followed by surface budding to produce membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies. Most of these were ingested and degraded by mononuclear phagocytes resident within the epithelium and a few by adjoining acinar cells. As atrophy progressed, the phagocytes increased in number through division and immigration of monocytes. The apoptotic deletion of acinar cells was characteristically effected without basement membrane disruption and was accompanied by simultaneous duct cell proliferation. The consequent rapid glandular remodeling resulted in reduction of the lobules to clusters of ductules in a collagenous stroma.\r"

  ".W": "Atherosclerosis occurs in the aorta of White Carneau pigeons proximal to the celiac bifurcation, where monocyte adhesion and migration into lesions have been demonstrated. This study documents chemoattractants that might be responsible for monocyte adherence and migration. Ten-week-old pigeons were fed either a cholesterol-free (normal) diet or a 0.4% cholesterol diet for 12 or 24 weeks. Birds with a normal diet did not have lesions in the lesion-prone area of the aorta, whereas birds fed a cholesterol-containing diet had simple intimal foam-cell lesions (12 weeks) or foam-cell lesions complicated with extracellular lipid and fibrillar matrix material (24 weeks). Plasma cholesterol levels in birds on the cholesterol-containing diet were 780-1080 mg/dl versus 140-240 mg/dl in the normal diet control group(s) at necropsy. To assay for chemoattractants, tissue was collected from lesion-prone and nonsusceptible (nonlesion) areas of the aortas. Samples from the two types of regions were separately pooled, then homogenized and tested for chemoattractant activity for pigeon peripheral blood monocytes. Monocyte chemoattractants were demonstrated in lesion area homogenates from pigeons fed cholesterol for 12 or 24 weeks and also in analogous homogenates from pigeons fed a normal diet. Monocyte migration to lesion-prone homogenates was significantly greater than that to nonlesion area homogenates. The chemoattractants in homogenates were monocyte-specific. The chemoattractant activity in the birds fed cholesterol for 12 weeks was confined to the aqueous phase of lipid extracts. This activity was abolished by pronase but unaffected by heat (100 C, 30 minutes), which indicated that the chemoattractant(s) in these homogenates was heat-stable protein(s). Activity in lipid extracts of lesion area homogenates from birds fed a cholesterol-containing diet for 24 weeks was found in both the aqueous and organic phases, suggesting that these samples contained lipid as well as proteinaceous chemoattractants.\r"

Corresponding jejunal segments from rats that did not undergo surgery were used as controls. Proliferation of anaerobic bacteria developed in the test animals by the first week after surgery. Despite anaerobic bacterial proliferation, no adherence by bacteria to the intestinal microvillus surface was observed by scanning or transmission electron microscopy. Rather, bacteria were present within the mucus layer overlying the intestinal mucosal surface. Immunoassay of goblet cell mucin demonstrated an increase in the proportion of mucin present in the intestinal lumen and a decrease in mucin levels in the jejunal mucosa. These results suggest that the interaction of bacteria with mucus is an important mechanism of protection of the mucosal surface in experimental small bowel bacterial overgrowth.\r"

The cloned mast cells rapidly extruded the contents of their immature granules (dense progranular material and membrane-bound vesicles) to the exterior via multiple openings in the plasma membrane. Degranulation was associated with striking activation of the cell surface, characterized initially by elongation of surface processes, as well as by close approximation of strands of rough endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface and by the development of coated pits. At later times after stimulation, degranulated mast cells had released nearly all of their granules and exhibited angular surfaces lacking elongated processes. These findings demonstrate for the first time that cloned, immature mast cells, like their mature counterparts, can undergo classic morphologic release reactions involving exocytosis of granules.\r"

Only catecholamines acting on alpha-adrenoreceptors produced glomerular capillary thrombosis (GCT) typical of the generalized Shwartzman reaction (GSR). Epinephrine produced GCT three times (P less than 0.05) less severe than that produced by N, but beta-blockade with propranolol (P) rendered E equal to N in potency. I and D reduced fibrinogen consumption produced by thrombin. I (0.5-0.66 microgram/kg/min), as opposed to D, prevented the GSR produced by endotoxin in the pregnant rat and the cortisone-sensitized rabbit, and P increased the severity of the GSR in the pregnant rat. Alpha-adrenergic blockade with dibenzyline prevented the GSR produced by endotoxin in rats, whether pregnant, diabetic, or having a unilateral ureteral occlusion, and the classic reaction in rabbits, but not that produced in renal-hypertensive rats. Simultaneous alpha + beta stimulations by E triggered coronary and hepatic microthrombi, which were prevented by P. It is concluded that beta-adrenergic stimulation, as opposed to D-adrenergic stimulation, counterbalances alpha-adrenergic effects occurring in endotoxemia, which are required for production of the GSR in most models. These studies stress the risks and benefits of beta-blockade and provide additional evidence for the role of vasoactive agents and microcirculatory changes on selection of target organs for production of microthrombi during DIC.\r"

This method may also be useful for identifying and correcting problems in the painful below knee stump. These load cells are further used to compute the center of pressure of a normal subject and a below knee amputee.

Experienced professionals have also been shown to exaggerate the distress of their SCI patients and these misperceptions tend to progressively worsen with length of clinical experience. The present study replicated and extended this tendency amongst research personnel and their SCI subjects. Staff members tended to over-estimate depression, anxiety, and social discomfort while under-estimating the optimism of their SCI subjects. Recommendations are made for the use of a questionnaire to measure their distress. Also, suggestions are made regarding the potential clinical utility of assessing the contrasting perceptions of distress by SCI patients and significant people in their rehabilitation and social environments.\r"

Clinical vignettes of the veterans with auditory hallucinations are given, and the implications of the results for a subgroup of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder veterans are discussed.\r"

Only four subjects completed withdrawal on schedule (4-5 weeks); four additional subjects discontinued treatment in 7-13 weeks. During withdrawal 15 patients had recurrent or increased panic attacks and nine had significant new withdrawal symptoms. Most common among the latter were malaise, weakness, insomnia, tachycardia, lightheadedness, and dizziness. None had seizures, psychosis, or significant neurological or EEG abnormalities. Results indicate that relapse and withdrawal are important considerations in the choice of alprazolam treatment for panic attacks.\r"

While bipolar I and bipolar II patients were more likely to relapse and bipolar I patients were more likely to attempt suicide, these patients resembled nonbipolar depressed patients in likelihood of recovery and psychosocial impairment in various areas. Compared to nonbipolar patients, those with bipolar I depression were much more likely to develop mania, while bipolar II patients were more likely to develop hypomania. Cycling during the index episode predicted a relatively low likelihood of recovery for bipolar I patients but had no apparent prognostic significance for patients with bipolar II illness.\r"

Intercorrelations among self-reported attitude change, written examination grade, and student rating of satisfaction with the clerkship suggest that each measures different processes. Low but significant correlations between preceptor ratings of interaction skills and data-gathering skills and process and content scores based on an end-of-course videotaped interview suggest that preceptor ratings and the videotaped interview method evaluated the same skills. The authors conclude that preceptor evaluations supplemented by objective ratings of videotaped interviews show promise for evaluating the development of interviewing skills.\r"

Consultants recommended combined psychopharmacologic and psychodynamic therapies for most patients and found psychodynamic psychotherapy strikingly overlooked by consultees, all of whom were psychiatrists or other mental health professionals. This evaluation documents the psychiatric consultees' deemphasis of the biopsychosocial perspective in clinical practice.\r"

Four of the 11 patients had REM- and non-REM-related nightmares, which, in two sea disaster patients, were associated with REM-related motor activity.

However, previous use of VA outpatient and inpatient psychiatric services and VA psychiatric disability rating predicted utilization of psychiatric care during the study.
