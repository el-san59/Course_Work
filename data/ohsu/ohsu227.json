  ".W": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha has been identified as a major inducer of colony stimulating factor (CSF)-secretion by human vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In the present study we assessed the capacity of TNFs to induce release of CSF-1 from highly purified peripheral blood monocyte preparations. Whereas monocytes do not accumulate CSF-1 messenger (m)RNA constitutively and consequently do not produce CSF-1 protein, CSF-1 mRNA and protein secretion became detectable, when monocytes were cultured in the presence of TNF-alpha, that was synergistically enhanced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). However, under identical experimental conditions TNF-beta failed to induce monocyte CSF-1 synthesis. Cultures of monocytes in the presence of TNF-beta before addition of TNF-alpha abolished the CSF-1 inducing capacity of TNF-alpha, suggesting that TNF-beta may act as antagonist to TNF-alpha for CSF-1 production. These data point out a previously unrecognized function of TNF-alpha to modulate CSF-1 release by monocytes and demonstrate disparate biological properties of different TNF species in hematopoiesis.\r"

Overall, 30-day mortality was 27 per cent. Survival was 61 per cent after 1 year and 39 per cent after 5 years. Serious encephalopathy requiring hospital admission occurred in 5 patients (11 per cent of patients surviving more than 1 month). Shunt patency was assessed by scintisplenoportography and ultrasonography. Cumulative shunt occlusion rate was 16 per cent after 1 year, 33 per cent after 5 years and 52 per cent after 8 years of follow-up. Out of 17 patients with an occluded shunt, 9 had persistent or recurrent bleeding, while 3 patients had recurrent bleeding despite a patent shunt. We conclude that the mesocaval Dacron interposition shunt should not be recommended as the procedure of first choice for portosystemic shunting.\r"

Values for C3a were significantly increased when compared with normal controls, with maximum levels during the second week, while C5a levels were slightly elevated initially. These levels did not correlate with the extent of tissue injury, the development of septic complications or the clinical outcome. However, it appears likely that C3a and C5a may be responsible for some of the pathophysiological alterations observed following thermal injury.\r"

All patients received vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase for remission induction, CNS prophylaxis with cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate, and continuation therapy with 6-mercaptopurine plus methotrexate. Forty-seven of 101 patients with non-T ALL and 18 of 26 patients with T-cell ALL received ara-C/cyclo pulses every eight weeks during continuation therapy. The age, sex, and initial white cell count distributions were similar in both treatment groups. Patients with non-T-cell ALL had similar DFS with or without ara-C/cyclo pulses (36% versus 48%; P = 0.32). Ara-C/cyclo pulses significantly improved DFS in children with T-cell ALL (36% versus 0%; P = 0.015). Toxicities of the ara-C/cyclo pulses included reversible pancytopenia, drug induced fever, fever associated with neutropenia, and death in one patient from systemic candidiasis while neutropenic. This is the first clinical evidence to indicate that the combination of ara-C/cyclo used during continuation therapy is selectively beneficial in T-cell ALL.\r"

Although the S-fraction correlates with histologic classification, the relationship between specific immunologic phenotypes and DNA ploidy is less well known. We investigated this relationship in 106 cases of NHL. Samples from 17 SEG institutions were sent for flow cytometry and for frozen section immunoperoxidase phenotyping. DNA histograms were analyzed for ploidy changes and cases classified by degree of abnormality. Ninety-eight cases were B-cell and eight were T-cell. B-cell tumors were subdivided by expression of antigens CD24, CD10, CD5, HB31, CD22, CD20, and transferrin receptor. Among B-cell tumors there was no correlation between degree of aneuploidy and phenotype, but B-cell tumors displayed a higher degree of aneuploidy than T-cell tumors (P less than 0.02). There was no difference between the S-fractions of B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. However, the transferrin receptor was more often expressed when the S-fraction was higher than 5%. Cases with S-fractions higher than 5% were more likely to lack any of the Pan-B antigens CD19, CD22 or CD20, and also were more frequently CD24 negative. We conclude that T-cell and B-cell NHL differ in degree of aneuploidy, and that monoclonal antibody phenotyping and DNA ploidy analysis independently define subgroups of B-cell NHL. Within B-cell lymphomas phenotype also correlates with grade of NHL as defined by the S-fraction.\r"

The study, based on the analysis of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies and on functional in vitro tests, showed the following main abnormalities: reduction of the absolute number of circulating T-cells; inversion of the CD4/CD8 ratio, both in the peripheral blood and in the involved lymph nodes; high percentages of activated T-cells (CD8+/HLA-DR+); defective T-cell response in vitro to the PHA mitogen; and minimal helper and enhanced in vitro suppressor functions. Some of these immunologic dysfunctions are also observed in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) which has in common with AILD several clinical features. However, no evidence of HTLV-III infection could be demonstrated in our patients with AILD.\r"

Control values, followed by changes after induction and during a 3-min delay before intubation were recorded for the following parameters: heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP, DBP), respiratory rate (RR), end-tidal CO2 (PETCO2), and induction time (IT). In addition, the incidence of adverse reactions and time for recovery from anaesthesia were noted. The IT (mean +/- SE) was 35 +/- 1 sec for propofol, 35 +/- 1.2 sec for thiopentone and 34 +/- 1.4 sec for methohexitone. Ninety-three per cent of the PROP group fell asleep with one dose and required no additional doses. Fifty per cent of each of the THIO and METH groups required additional agents (p less than 0.05). METH was associated with the highest elevation in HR, PROP the least (p less than 0.05). PROP was associated with the most decrease in SBP and DBP and in addition respiratory depression (p less than 0.05). The incidence of injection pain or excitatory activity was equal in the three groups with the exception that 14 patients who received METH developed hiccoughs while none did in the other groups. PROP was associated with the most rapid recovery, particularly with respect to the orientation time. We conclude that PROP is an effective alternative to barbiturate induction and that the published recommended doses of THIO and METH are often ineffective.\r"

The norepinephrine stimulation was antagonized by prazosin (10(-7) M) but not by propranolol (10(-7) M), indicating mediation via alpha 1-adrenoceptors. The carbachol stimulation was antagonized by atropine (10(-7) M). The stimulation by norepinephrine was significantly higher in right atria (837 +/- 151 to 6,614 +/- 1,210, n = 6, cpm/g tissue) than in other regions of the heart. Both norepinephrine and carbachol stimulated the formation of inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate with norepinephrine stimulation being detected as early as 15 seconds. Furthermore, the inositol trisphosphate was identified as the -1,4,5 isomer by anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. These data are consistent with the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate yielding inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate. Inositol-(1,3,4)-trisphosphate was not detected in heart preparations, suggesting unusual metabolism of inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate in heart tissue.\r"

This study was designed to evaluate the use of cine-computed tomography (cine-CT) to determine relative bypass graft flow velocities and flow reserve. Saphenous vein grafts from the left innominate to the midleft circumflex coronary artery were placed in 5 dogs. The proximal portion of the left circumflex was then ligated. A 20-mHz Doppler probe to assess graft flow velocity, a cuff-type vascular occluder to provide variable graft occlusion, and an infusion line for selective drug administration were placed at the midgraft position. Electrocardiographically triggered scans were performed at levels of the aortic root and cardiac base following bolus inferior vena cava contrast administration. Continuous recordings of Doppler velocity and aortic pressure and intermittent measurements of cardiac output were obtained throughout the studies. Selective increases and decreases in coronary artery bypass graft flow velocity from control were performed using combinations of intragraft adenosine and/or variable graft occlusion. Simultaneous contrast clearance curves were generated from a region of interest in the ascending aorta and in the coronary artery bypass graft. Subsequent determinations of a parameter, delta PT (the time difference between peak opacification in the aorta and the bypass graft), were found to highly correlate with individual values of relative coronary bypass graft flow velocity (r = 0.74-0.97, n = 54). This study suggests that cine-computed tomography can be used to noninvasively quantify relative bypass graft flow velocities in individual dogs and eventually in patients.\r"

We used the 20 MHz 80-channel pulsed Doppler velocimeter developed in our laboratory. An operator placed a specially designed probe on the native LAD with his fingers. Before induction of extracorporeal circulation, LAD blood velocities were measured at several locations distal to the stenosis. The poststenotic flow velocities were rich in systolic flow component with reduced diastolic component. The velocity configuration in the poststenotic portions was characterized by the presence of reverse flow velocities and/or irregularity of the velocity pattern near the vessel wall, indicating the existence of flow separation and recirculation in the regions. The broadening of the velocity spectrum observed at central axial regions suggested the occurrence of flow disturbances. After grafting, the velocity waveform in the LAD beyond a vein bypass graft changed to a diastolic-predominant pattern with a relatively small systolic component. A transient bypass graft occlusion caused a marked reduction in diastolic flow velocity. The systolic-to-diastolic velocity ratio increased from 0.27 +/- 0.07 to 1.50 +/- 0.50 (p less than .01) by the graft occlusion.\r"

During this time the maximal and pain-free walking distances increased significantly (more than 100%). Group II (n = 20) patients did not exercise over the same period of time, and their walking distances remained essentially unchanged. No drugs or other forms of treatment were given in either group. The rheology of blood, as quantified by blood and plasma viscosity, hematocrit, blood filterability, and red cell aggregation, was initially abnormal in patients as compared with matched controls. Blood and plasma viscosity, blood cell filterability, and red cell aggregation normalized significantly in group I, but remained pathologic in group II. The hemorrheologic values of patients after 2 months of exercise did no longer differ significantly from those of healthy controls. The \"fluidification\" of blood induced by regular exercise was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that obtainable by hemorrheologically active medications. The results confirm that physical training is clinically effective in patients suffering from claudication. They furthermore suggest that training may be looked on as a form of \"hemorrheologic therapy\" suitable for increasing the fluidity of blood in patients with ischemic diseases. Part of the benefits of regular exercise in stage II occlusive peripheral arterial disease may result from changes in hemorrheology; further studies are needed to define the mechanism.\r"

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the impact on long-term patient survival of changes over time in medical and surgical therapy. Among 5125 patients referred for catheterization between 1969 and 1984, 2261 underwent surgery, and 2864 received medical therapy. Survival in both medically and surgically treated patients improved over time. The improvement in medical patients was due to less sick patients being treated (a decreasing baseline risk), while that observed in surgical patients was due to refinements in care. The rate of improvement in survival over time was much greater in surgical patients, and the difference as compared with medical therapy was highly significant (treatment interaction with time p less than .0001). Estimates of 5 year survival adjusted for baseline risk factors for a patient in 1977 with one-, two-, or three-vessel disease and an ejection fraction of 0.40 were 0.88, 0.80, and 0.64 in medically treated, and 0.88, 0.87, and 0.80 in surgically treated patients. Corresponding projected estimates for 1984 were unchanged for medical patients but improved for surgical patients (0.93, 0.92, and 0.90). Thus, the projected survival benefits of surgery in 1984 appear more significant for all categories of coronary artery disease because of a differential improvement in surgical therapy. These data are relevant to therapeutic decision making for current patients and emphasize the importance of continued analysis of this topic as treatment efficacies change over time.\r"

  ".W": "Emergency coronary bypass for cardiogenic shock has been associated with a high operative mortality. From January 1983 through March 1986, 69 patients at Crawford W. Long Hospital underwent emergency coronary artery bypass. Seventeen of 69 were in shock, 15 with hypotension requiring treatment (intra-aortic balloon pump in 10; catecholamines in six). The other two patients had a low cardiac index and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure greater than 25 mm Hg. Of these patients, nine presented with acute infarction, four with failed angioplasty, and four with uncontrollable angina. Four patients required cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After operation, 94% of the patients required catecholamine support and 71% were treated with an intra-aortic balloon pump. There were two hospital deaths (12%). The median postoperative stay for survivors was 9 days. Major complications occurred in 47%. Follow-up (100%, mean 20.5 months) revealed no late deaths, a 3 year survival of 88 +/- 8%, and a functional class of I in six patients, II in seven patients, and III in two patients. The nine patients who were working before operation all returned to work. Of the 52 emergency coronary bypass patients without shock, one patient died in the hospital (2%), 52% required catecholamines (p less than .05 vs shock group by chi-square analysis), and 12% required an intra-aortic balloon pump after operation (p less than .05 vs shock group by chi-square analysis). Median stay was 8 days. Complications occurred in 13% (p less than .05 vs shock group by chi-square analysis). Three year survival was 91 +/- 4%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To evaluate the role of intraoperative high-frequency epicardial echocardiography we examined 82 coronary artery bypass graft anastomoses in 29 patients shortly before or just after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Minor defects that did not compromise the lumen of the anastomoses were seen in two patients. One major technical error, a near total occlusion of an internal mammary-to-coronary artery anastomosis, was not apparent on external inspection, but was clearly identified with high-frequency epicardial echocardiography. This was revised immediately. Thus, high-frequency epicardial echocardiography permits the intraoperative evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft anastomoses so that technical errors can be quickly identified and corrected.\r"

  ".W": "To study the effects of increasing age on outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 684 patients who underwent CABG from 1980 to 1985 were entered into a noncurrent prospective study. Patients were matched by date of operation and placed into three groups according to age: (1) 70 and older, (2) 55 to 69, or (3) less than 55. In addition to intraoperative and postoperative data collected on all patients, follow-up was obtained on 97% of the patients at a mean of 30 +/- 16 months. Older patients were more often female (p less than .002), and white (p less than .001) and had more preexisting cerebrovascular disease (p less than .0001), peripheral vascular disease (p less than .001), unstable angina (p less than .0001), and longer mean bypass pump times (p less than .001). Older patients had a higher hospital mortality (9.3% vs 2.2%), suffered more complications, including stroke, wound infection, reoperation for bleeding, need for intropic drug support, and prolonged ventilation, and had longer mean postoperative hospital stays (14 vs 9 days, p less than .0001). After discharge, mortality rates were similar in all groups, as was recurrence of symptoms and degree of rehabilitation. While patient age at operation significantly influenced hospital mortality and morbidity, this appeared to be a consequence of the greater frequency of risk factors in patients over 70 years of age. In addition, late follow-up failed to demonstrate any significant differences based on age alone in survival or functional status among patients undergoing CABG.\r"

This was performed in order to investigate the complex nature of heat transfer within the temporal bone and the influence which anatomical variations may have upon the accuracy of evaluation of vestibular function by means of the caloric test. No significant correlation could be found between the maximum temperature change occurring across the lateral semicircular canal and any of the parameters obtained from radiological assessment except for the diameter of the internal auditory meatus. It was deduced that an intra-subject difference in the diameters of the internal auditory meatus of 0.5 mm would introduce an absolute error in the evaluation of percentage canal paresis of 10%. Since normal intra-subject differences in internal meatus diameter can exceed 0.5 mm, this finding was considered to be highly significant.\r"

This study was undertaken to determine what factors may discriminate between early and late discharge following surgery. In 177 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG procedures, three groups were formed retrospectively according to the number of days hospitalized post CABG: group 1, less than or equal to 8; group 2, 9 to 11; group 3, greater than or equal to 12. Parameters found to discriminate between group 1 and group 3 (p less than .05; chi square analysis) included female sex, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF), age greater than or equal to 65 years, and the development of major postoperative complications. Angina class, prior myocardial infarction, extent of coronary artery disease, aortic cross-clamp time, number of bypass grafts, ejection fraction less than 40 percent, or \"minor\" postoperative complications were not different among groups. Patients discharged less than or equal to 8 days following CABG had no increase in return visits or readmissions less than 60 days post CABG. We conclude that while certain patients can be safely discharged less than or equal to 8 days post CABG, patients who are female, greater than or equal to 65 years, have unstable angina, CHF, or a major postoperative complication are likely to be hospitalized longer.\r"

  ".U": "88028788\r", 
  ".W": "Longitudinal measurement is increasingly used to quantify the effects of recent and ongoing influences on lung function, whether treatments of groups of patients, or exposures of working or community populations. The variability in an estimate, eg, mean annual change in FEV1, comes from two sources; variability from true differences in annual change among individuals (called signal), and variability from measurement error (called noise). Signal is useful variability, potentially relatable to explanatory variables, and noise is extraneous. Assuming the variance of true differences remains constant, any increase in noise produces a calculable fall in the proportion of signal in the total observation, which fall we term \"signal decay\". This is not a function of the number of individuals, which influences rather the statistical power to determine that observed differences are not likely from chance alone. Imprecision in the estimation of individuals' rates of change is a major source of signal decay. Within practical limits, this can be compensated for by increasing the length of the study. Higher rates of subject attrition cause signal decay, in addition to loss of statistical power and susceptibility to survivor bias. Increasing the frequency of testing, within a study of constant length, has little effect on signal and noise, but interval testing protects against secular bias and minimizes data loss from subject attrition.\r"

A component in thecal/interstitial cell-conditioned medium inhibited specific binding of [125I]iodo-epidermal growth factor ([125I]EGF) to its cell surface receptor, as determined with an EGF radioreceptor assay. Thecal/interstitial cell secreted proteins also stimulated growth of an EGF-dependent cell line. Granulosa cells isolated from the same ovaries did not produce detectable levels of an EGF-like substance, as determined by both EGF RRA and EGF growth assay. Fractionation of thecal/interstitial cell secreted proteins by size exclusion HPLC resulted in a 35K component being detected by both the EGF RRA and the growth assay. An EGF-like substance was also detected when thecal/interstitial cell secreted proteins were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC. Several biochemical properties of the EGF-like substance examined were different from those of authentic mouse EGF. However, the biological activities of the EGF-like substance and mouse EGF were similar in their ability to promote the growth of an EGF-dependent cell line. In addition to the production of an EGF-like substance, the thecal/interstitial cell preparation also produced an EGF inhibitory activity. This thecal/interstitial cell secreted product was fractionated from the EGF-like substance and inhibited the ability of EGF to stimulate cell growth. EGF receptors are present on granulosa cells, and EGF is known to influence both the growth and differentiation of these cells. Observations indicate that ovarian thecal/interstitial cells produce an EGF-like substance that may act as a paracrine factor to regulate granulosa cell growth and differentiation. In addition, an EGF inhibitory activity is produced that also may have a role in regulating follicular cell growth.\r"

  ".W": "Previously, we showed that 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), an activator of protein kinase C, is a mitogen for fetal human definitive zone adrenocortical cells in culture. In the present experiments, TPA inhibited forskolin-stimulated cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) synthesis, and enhanced forskolin-stimulated progesterone and corticosterone synthesis. These changes in the pattern of steroidogenesis were shown to result from changes in enzyme activities after forskolin treatment. TPA increased forskolin-stimulated 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) 2-fold, while depressing forskolin-stimulated 17 c-hydroxylase to basal values DHEA sulfotransferase increased 3-fold on transfer of human adrenocortical cells from serum-containing to defined, serum-free medium; TPA inhibited this increase. Experiments in which TPA was added at various times during the time course of forskolin stimulation of 17 alpha-hydroxylase showed that TPA prevents the increase in the level of 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and does not have a direct inhibitory effect on 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity. TPA also inhibited stimulation of 17 alpha-hydroxylase by cAMP analogs, indicating that the inhibition of 17 alpha-hydroxylase by TPA is not due to an effect on adenylate cyclase. Previous experiments have shown that stimulation of intracellular cAMP is sufficient for androgen synthesis by the human adrenocortical cell, under defined, serum-free conditions, and that its high rate of androgen synthesis likely results from the relative levels of 3 beta-HSD, 17 alpha-hydroxylase, and DHEA sulfotransferase in the cell. Enzyme induction by cAMP results in increased production of both androgens and glucocorticoids, whereas activation of protein kinase C changes the balance of enzymes, resulting in increased non-17 alpha-hydroxylated steroid synthesis and decreased androgen and cortisol biosynthesis.\r"

The probe pAS1 detects an argininosuccinate synthetase pseudogene 6 (ASSP6), which has been mapped to Ycen-q11. The 4B-2 (DYS 15) probe detects a single-copy 3.3 kb EcoRI fragment that maps to the proximal portion of the Y long arm located distal to the sequence detected by the pAS1 probe. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples from normal males and females and ten males with spermatogenic arrest were digested with the restriction endonuclease EcoRI, electrophoresed on agarose gels, Southern blotted, and hybridized with the pAS1 and 4B-2 probes. All males tested, including the ten azoospermic males with spermatogenic arrest, exhibited 4.3 kb and 3.3 kb male specific fragments with the pAS1 and 4B-2 probes, respectively. From preliminary analyses, the authors conclude that the regions detected by these two probes are not absent in these azoospermic males and that the cause of their spermatogenic arrest may not involve deletion within this region. Molecular defects affecting spermatogenesis may involve loss of sequences at Yq11, which were not tested in the study, or they may derive from heterogenous causes.\r"

The HLA antigens of 75 Chinese patients and 100 Chinese controls in Hong Kong were studied to investigate the role of HLA-DR heterozygosity in Chinese individuals. Some of the patients and controls were also tested for allotypic variation in the complement components C2, C4, and BF. Three alleles, Aw33, B17, and DR3, had increased frequencies in patients compared with controls and frequently occurred together in the same phenotype, which suggested their existence as a haplotype. There were no statistically significant differences in complement allotype frequencies between patients and controls, although the C4B null allele seemed to be associated with Aw33, B17, and DR3. No other HLA-DR antigen appeared to be associated with IDDM. However, when the patients were separated on the basis of age at onset, the frequency of DR3/DRw9 heterozygosity was markedly increased in patients presenting in the first decade of life, but there was no increase in patients presenting at greater than 20 yr of age. DRw9 is strongly associated with autoimmune disease in Chinese, whereas DR3 is not. We suggest that the major IDDM susceptibility locus in Chinese is associated with HLA-DR3 and that patients with HLA-DR3 and HLA-DRw9 have an added predisposition to autoimmune disease and therefore develop IDDM earlier than patients without DRw9.\r"

Results were based on a study of 20 patients undergoing coronary revascularization, 9 patients undergoing modified Blalock-Taussig procedure, 15 patients requiring access for hemodyalisis, 6 patients undergoing peripheral revascularization, and 15 patients undergoing revascularization for impotence. Patients are well, and post-operative angiogram, when possible, showed patent BIMA grafts. Speadier anastomosis was possible, decreasing actual surgical time. Although long-term patency studies are required, the results of the present study justify the use of the BIMA graft as a small artery substitute if a healthy saphenous vein or internal mammary graft are not available. The ready availability in all sizes, superior handling, less likelihood to kinking, proper matching with the native artery, elasticity properties, and low cost, make this graft necessary in the armamentarium of the cardiovascular surgeon.\r"

  ".W": "In vitro production of thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAb) and thyroid microsomal autoantibodies (McAb) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with the B cell mitogen Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) and the T cell mitogen pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was examined in 35 normal subjects (NC) and 64 patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. Low concentrations of SAC plus PWM resulted in a synergistic effect on thyroid autoantibody production as well as nonspecific immunoglobulin G production. With such maximal stimulation, TgAb production was detected in all PBMC preparations from serum TgAb-positive patients with AITD; TgAb production was also detected in some NC (46%) and serum TgAb-negative patients with AITD (39%), but the levels of TgAb production were low. Similarly, McAb production was marked in PBMC preparations from serum TgAb-negative but McAb-positive patients. TgAb-secreting cells were also detected in NC by the plaque-forming cell (PFC) assay. The response patterns of PBMC to mitogen (Nil, PWM, and SAC plus PWM) in terms of TgAb production varied among serum TgAb-positive patients with AITD, but not among NC and serum TgAb-negative patients with AITD. Serum TgAb titers were significantly correlated with the in vitro production of TgAb by PBMC with no stimulation (r = 0.64; n = 99; P less than 0.001), with stimulation by PWM (r = 0.75), and with stimulation by SAC plus PWM (r = 0.87); the correlation coefficient increased with the efficiency of stimulation of B cell differentiation. Similar results were found for McAb production. These data suggest that 1) optimal in vitro thyroid autoantibody production occurs with B cell mitogen (SAC) acting synergistically with T cell mitogen (PWM); 2) sufficient numbers of resting B lymphocytes specific for Tg or microsomal antigens are present in some NC PBMC; 3) stages of thyroid-specific B cell differentiation in PBMC vary among serum thyroid autoantibody-positive patients with AITD; and 4) the potential of PBMC to produce thyroid autoantibodies may correlate with the capacity of thyroid-derived lymphocytes. Thus, the circulating lymphocytes may provide a useful vehicle by which sequential changes occurring at the tissue level may be examined.\r"

  ".W": "After surgical cure of Cushing's syndrome most patients develop transient secondary adrenal insufficiency that lasts for approximately 1 yr. Since ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas generally respond to ovine CRH (oCRH), we tested the hypothesis that an early postoperative response to oCRH may indicate the presence of residual pituitary tumor and, therefore, predict recurrence. We also assessed the usefulness of oCRH for monitoring the recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and for clarifying the pathophysiology of this condition. Thirty-four patients cured of Cushing's syndrome (29 with Cushing's disease, 3 with adrenal adenomas, and 2 with the ectopic ACTH syndrome) had an evening oCRH test 1-2 weeks after surgery. Nine patients (6 with Cushing's disease, 2 with adrenal adenomas, and 1 with the ectopic ACTH syndrome) participated in a longitudinal evaluation and had repeated oCRH and 1-h ACTH tests at 2-month intervals for a year after surgery. Patients were considered to be cured on the basis of at least 3 subnormal urinary [less than 20 micrograms/24 h (less than 55 nmol/day)] or morning plasma cortisol levels [0600-0900 h; less than 6 micrograms/dL (less than 170 nmol/L)] in the first 2 weeks after surgery. The plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH in the early postoperative period were subnormal in 23 and normal in 6 patients with Cushing's disease. Three patients developed recurrent Cushing's disease (3, 3, and 23 months after transphenoidal surgery). All 3 were among the 6 who had a normal early postoperative response to oCRH. All of the 23 patients who had a subnormal response to oCRH in the early postoperative period have remained in remission for an average follow-up period of 14 months (6-42 months). Thus, the recurrence rate was significantly greater in patients with normal oCRH tests in the early postoperative period (P less than 0.001, by chi 2 analysis). Surgically cured patients with adrenal adenomas or ectopic ACTH secretion also had subnormal plasma ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH during the early postoperative period. During longitudinal evaluation for 12 months after surgery, the ACTH and cortisol responses to oCRH increased progressively (regardless of the cause of Cushing's syndrome). Cortisol responses to oCRH correlated significantly with the cortisol responses to exogenous ACTH (r = 0.89; P less than 0.00001). We conclude that most patients with Cushing's syndrome have suppressed responses to oCRH during the early postoperative period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To investigate the suppressor function of intrathyroidal (TG) T cells in Graves' disease, the percentage of suppressor T cell subsets and the suppressor function of TG and peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes in Graves' disease were compared by determining the in vitro production of immunoglobulin G (IgG) in reconstituted mixtures of separated B, CD4+ (helper/suppressor-inducer T), and CD8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic T) cells. TG lymphocytes were obtained by gradient centrifugation of the supernatants of minced thyroid tissues. T Cells were separated by E-rosette formation, and CD4+ and CD8+ cell-rich populations were separated by a panning method using monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody. Mixtures of 5 X 10(4) B (PB1 or TG) cells, 2 X 10(4) CD4+ (PB or TG) cells, and 5 X 10(3) macrophages (PB or TG) were cultured with various numbers of CD8+ (PB) or CD8+ (TG) cells for 7 days with pokeweed mitogen, and IgG synthesis was determined by solid phase RIA. T cell subpopulations were quantitated by a direct immunofluorescence method using monoclonal anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 antibodies. There was no difference in the percentages of CD8+ cells among total T cells between thyroid glands and peripheral blood from Graves' disease patients [mean PB, 39.8 +/- 9.8% (+/- SD); TG, 42.5 +/- 13.8%; n = 10]. IgG production by mixtures of B and CD4+ cells isolated from peripheral blood was not different from that by cells isolated from thyroid glands [mean PB, 1635 +/- 248 (+/- SE) ng/mL; TG, 1081 +/- 128 ng/mL; n = 19; P = NS]. The nonspecific suppressor activity of thyroid gland CD8+ cells was less than that of CD8+ (PB) cells [percent suppression of IgG production by mixtures of B (PB) and CD4+ (PB) cells, 12.5% vs. 57.0% (P less than 0.01); by mixtures of B (TG) and CD4+ (TG) cells, 5.8% vs. 38.9% (P less than 0.01)]. The suppressor-inducer function of CD4+ (TG) cells was also decreased compared with that of CD4+ (PB) cells. These results suggest that the impairment of suppressor cell activity may lead to excessive production of autoantibody in thyroid glands from patients with Graves' disease.\r"

  ".W": "HLA-Bw47, a rare human histocompatibility antigen, occurs in strong linkage disequilibrium with HLA-A3,Cw6,DR7 and salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and is associated with a contiguous deletion of the active CA21HB gene and the C4B complement gene. We studied the HLA-A3,Cw6,Bw47,DR7 haplotype in 10 subjects of the Old Order Amish of Lancaster County in Pennsylvania and found that this haplotype, which occurs with a similar frequency in this group as in the general caucasoid population, has C4B and Ca21HB genes. These C4B and CA21HB genes are expressed as assessed by C4 typing and iv ACTH testing, respectively. Serological studies indicate that the HLA-D loci of this Amish haplotype are the same as those in patients with HLA-Bw47 and CAH, but different from HLA-D loci coupled to HLA-B13, which some workers have proposed is the progenitor genotype for HLA-Bw47. Our studies demonstrate that 1) HLA-Bw47 is not an invariant marker for salt-losing CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, and 2) the HLA-Bw47 phenotype coupled to CAH is not derived from the HLA-B13 genotype by a single mutation.\r"

  ".W": "To determine whether alterations in serum thyroid hormone levels affect hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, we measured the plasma immunoreactive (IR) ACTH and IR-cortisol responses to 1 microgram/kg BW ovine CRH (oCRH) given iv in the late afternoon and the plasma IR-ACTH, IR-cortisol, and IR-11-deoxycortisol responses to 2 g metyrapone given orally at midnight in 10 athyreotic patients during T4 treatment and 1 month after stopping T4 when they were biochemically, but not clinically, hypothyroid. Mean serum TSH increased from 0.7 +/- 0.9 (+/- SD) mU/L (normal range 0.5-4.9 mU/L) during T4 therapy to 107 +/- 82 mU/L after stopping T4. The serum total T4 level and free T4 index fell from 165 +/- 37 nmol/L and 1.9 +/- 0.4, respectively (normal range, 59-154 nmol/L and 0.9-2.5, respectively), to 19 +/- 9 and 0.2 +/- 0.1, respectively, after stopping T4. Basal plasma IR-ACTH and IR-cortisol levels at 0800 and 1630 h were similar during and after stopping T4 therapy. Peak plasma IR-ACTH and IR-cortisol levels after oCRH were significantly greater after stopping T4 (20 +/- 9.2 pmol/L and 880 +/- 260 nmol/L, respectively) than during T4 therapy (9.7 +/- 4.7 pmol/L and 720 +/- 190 nmol/L; P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively). The mean integrated plasma IR-ACTH and IR-cortisol responses to oCRH were also significantly greater P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively) after stopping T4 than during T4 therapy. Plasma IR-ACTH the morning after metyrapone was slightly (1.6-fold) but not significantly greater during therapy than after stopping T4 therapy (100 +/- 86 vs. 65 +/- 54 pmol/L, respectively). The plasma IR-11-deoxycortisol responses to metyrapone during and after stopping T4 therapy were similar (720 +/- 250 and 750 +/- 330 nmol/L, respectively), presumably because plasma IR-ACTH concentrations were maximally stimulating in both instances. These results indicate that thyroid hormone deficiency of short duration 1) increases corticotroph sensitivity to oCRH, 2) may diminish the plasma ACTH response to metyrapone-induced hypocortisolemia, and 3) has no apparent effect on the acute adrenal response to ACTH. These data together with those of previous studies that have shown reduced responses of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to metyrapone and hypoglycemia in hypothyroid patients suggest that the release of hypothalamic CRH and/or other ACTH secretagogues may be decreased in hypothyroidism.\r"

A tubular structure about 2 mm in diameter containing Doppler flow signals was identified in the anterior interventricular sulcus in 7 (35%) of the normal subjects and 40 (50%) of the patients with cardiovascular disease. The blood flow within the tubular structure exhibited a biphasic flow pattern, consisting of systolic and diastolic phases with higher velocity during diastole. The highest velocities were observed in early diastole and, in several cases, a small peak was detected during the atrial contraction phase. On the basis of its spatial orientation and characteristic flow pattern, the tubular structure was identified as the midportion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In a number of cases it was difficult to detect the systolic blood flow. Although blood flow was normally directed from the cardiac base to the apex, it was reversed toward the base in the patients with a bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery. In patients with severe aortic insufficiency, however, flow velocity was lower during diastole than during systole and the duration of diastolic flow was reduced, failing to continue to the end of diastole. Flow velocity was high in patients with a bypass graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery, aortic stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

During ventricular tachycardia, the sequence of activation in the intact ventricle was recorded simultaneously from 110 endocardial or 110 epicardial sites, or both. A balloon array of electrodes, inserted across the mitral valve, was used to obtain endocardial recordings in the left ventricle, and this appeared to facilitate the induction of ventricular tachycardia. Of 61 episodes of tachycardia, 16 (15 patients) were recorded with the epicardial sock and 45 (20 patients) with the additional use of the endocardial balloon. The sequence of activation during tachycardia was observed to conform to one of four configurations: monoregional spread was the most common activation sequence recorded on both the endocardium and epicardium, while biregional activation and figure eight sequences were recorded exclusively on the epicardium and endocardium, respectively. The fourth sequence was a circular spread of activation observed on both surfaces. Continuous activation throughout the tachycardia cycle length was an infrequent finding. Simultaneous recordings of endocardial and epicardial activation were obtained in 45% of episodes. The sequence of activation recorded on one surface was matched by a similar sequence on the remaining surface in less than half of these. The onset of endocardial activation preceded that of the epicardium in greater than 90% of tachycardia episodes, and the duration of left ventricular endocardial excitation often exceeded that recorded epicardially over both ventricles. The epicardium, however, did appear to be an important determinant of surface electrocardiographic configuration.\r"

If 20 minutes after the initiation of this infusion there was no conversion to sinus rhythm, the patient received a second intravenous infusion over 10 minutes (either propafenone or placebo, whichever was not given first). The electrocardiogram was recorded continuously throughout the study. Fourteen patients received propafenone and 10 received placebo. No patient's rhythm converted to sinus rhythm after placebo. In six patients (43%) (p less than 0.001), the arrhythmia converted to sinus rhythm between 5 and 10 minutes after the end of the propafenone infusion. After propafenone, the ventricular response to atrial fibrillation or flutter decreased significantly from 141.6 +/- 15.2 to 116.0 +/- 15.5 beats/min. Ventricular rate did not change after placebo. The mean propafenone plasma concentration was 3.46 +/- 2.17 mg/liter. The only side effect of propafenone noted was a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 9 +/- 9 mm Hg.

Twenty patients were delirious using DSM-III criteria, 19 more patients than were reported by the primary clinician. Seven delirious patients were less than 65 years of age (range, 32 to 64 years). Sixty-five percent of patients with delirium died, whereas significantly fewer (3.3%) of patients without delirium died (P less than .0001). We found that delirium could be readily and reliably detected (kappa coefficient of agreement = 0.62 for interrater reliability) using the DSM-III criteria. Clinicians should routinely screen hospitalized patients of all ages using DSM-III criteria to identify delirious patients for an immediate evaluation and treatment.\r"

  ".W": "Research on the mechanisms of nonrejection of the fetoplacental allograft has focused on the tissues composing the fetomaternal interface, of which the placental trophoblast, the tissue directly confronting the maternal environment, is considered a prime candidate responsible for the survival of the fetus. We recently developed a method for isolating murine trophoblast, and found that a proportion of trophoblast cells from mature placentas, cultured for 2 days, express class I antigens on their surface, and this expression can be enhanced in vitro by interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta). In the present study, it was determined that cultured trophoblast cells from day 14 placentas were resistant to allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (allo-CTL), while being susceptible to alloantibody and complement-mediated lysis. The trophoblast cells remained resistant to allo-CTL-mediated lysis despite IFN-mediated enhanced expression of class I H-2 antigens on their surface and the addition of phytohemagglutinin into the assay. Inhibition of protein synthesis also had no effect. In contrast, fetal fibroblasts, isolated from the same conceptuses, were readily susceptible to allo-CTL-mediated lysis. That the trophoblast cells do interact with the effector cells was shown by their ability to specifically inhibit the lysis of tumor target cells in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, trophoblast culture supernatants did not inhibit the lytic activity of allo-CTL, even when concentrated 10- to 25-fold, indicating that a soluble suppressor factor was not inactivating the effector cells. These results suggest that trophoblast cells have a protein synthesis-independent mechanism of resistance to lysis by allo-CTL, which could play an important role in protecting the fetoplacental allograft from maternal immune rejection.\r"

  ".W": "The requirements for inducing Lyt-2+ T cell proliferation in response to concanavalin A (Con A) were examined. Purified Lyt-2+ or L3T4+ spleen cells of C57BL/6 origin were stimulated with Con A and syngeneic macrophages (MO) in the presence of monoclonal antibodies to T cell markers or to polymorphic determinants on major histocompatibility complex molecules, and assessed for the ability to proliferate and to produce interleukin (IL) 2. alpha I-Ab failed to inhibit the Con A response of Lyt-2+ cells at dilutions that significantly inhibited the response of L3T4+ cells. In contrast, alphaKb/Db or alpha Lyt-2.2 specifically inhibited the response of Lyt-2+ cells, but not L3T4+ cells. The ability of alpha Kb/Db and of alpha Lyt-2.2 to inhibit the response of Lyt-2+ cells was dependent upon the concentration of Con A. These data demonstrate that optimal triggering of T cell subsets to proliferate and to produce IL-2 in response to Con A requires interactions with the appropriate restricting major histocompatibility complex molecule. The role of accessory cells in Lyt-2+ Con A-induced proliferation and IL-2 production was also investigated. Purified Lyt-2+ cells and purified L3T4+ cells failed to respond to Con A in the absence of MO. IL-1 reconstituted the response when MO were limiting, but failed to restore the response of either Lyt-2+ or L3T4+ cells when T cells were rigorously purified to remove all MO. These results demonstrate that triggering Lyt-2+ T cells, like L3T4+ T cells, requires accessory cells, and that this does not merely reflect a requirement for IL-1 production. Thus, Con A-induced proliferation and IL-2 production by Lyt-2+ T cells requires intimate contact with accessory cells and interactions dependent upon the class I-restricting element.\r"

Both target cell lysis and the release of CTL-associated serine esterase (SE), a marker for cytotoxic granules, were used as indicators of the CTL lytic response. We found triggering of the CTL lytic response occurred when both a PK-C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and a calcium ionophore, ionomycin, were added to CTL. The previously described inactivation of the CTL lytic response by long term treatment (24 hr) with PMA was also investigated. CTL cultured with PMA for 24 hr were unable to mediate target cell lysis or release SE; this inability to respond correlated with an absence of PK-C activity. Incubation of the PMA-treated CTL in the absence of PMA for an additional 24 hr resulted in recovery of PK-C activity, SE release, and the lytic response. These experiments strongly suggest that PK-C is involved with the transmembrane signaling required for SE release which is a necessary event in CTL-mediated target cell lysis.\r"

  ".U": "88034367\r", 
  ".W": "Most mature human T lymphocytes express both the multichain T3 (CD3)/Ti T cell receptor for antigen (TCR), and the biochemically distinct 55-kDa T11 (CD2) glycoprotein. Stimulating the T11 molecule causes profound T cell proliferation and functional activation in vitro, but the relationship of T11-mediated activation to antigenic stimulation of T lymphocytes in vivo remains unknown. We now present evidence that T11 function is directly linked to TCR components in T3/Ti+ T11+ human T cells. First, we found that stimulating peripheral blood T cells with the mitogenic combination of anti-T11(2) cells with the mitogenic combination of anti-T11(2) plus anti-T11(3) monoclonal antibodies caused the phosphorylation of TCR T3 chains. The predominance of T3-gamma-phosphorylation that occurred in anti-T11(2) plus anti-T11(3)-treated T cells is similar to the pattern previously observed in antigen-stimulated T cell clones. Second, T11 function depended upon concurrent cell-surface expression of the TCR. Thus, when peripheral blood T cells were deprived of cell surface T3/Ti by anti-T3 modulation, anti-T11(2) plus anti-T11(3)-induced mitogenesis and transmembrane signal generation in the form of calcium mobilization were inhibited. The mechanism of TCR-T11 interdependence was investigated in a series of TCR-deficient variants of a T cell lymphoblastoid cell line. T3/Ti negative variants expressed cell surface T11, but anti-T11(2) plus anti-T11(3) failed to cause detectable calcium mobilization. The TCR-deficient variants also failed to express T11(3) activation epitopes after incubation with anti-T11(2) antibodies, suggesting that T11(3) expression is an essential and TCR-dependent intermediate in the T11 activation mechanism in these cells. Taken together, our results suggest that T11 function depends upon cell-surface expression of TCR in many T3/Ti+ T11+ T lymphocytes, and T11-mediated activation is intimately interconnected with TCR activation mechanisms. A model in which stimulating signals delivered via T11 may be a part of antigenic activation of T lymphocytes is presented.\r"

Four weeks after immunization, the in vivo response to booster immunization, the in vitro pokeweed mitogen (PWM)-induced IgG secretion, and the in vitro T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigen-induced antibody response were assayed. Increase in serum antibody titer to TT and poliovirus was low and normal, respectively. In all five subjects studied, a high rate of spontaneous IgG production, including antibodies directed toward HIV was observed. Addition of PWM to the cultures induced suppression of the spontaneous IgG secretion. Only one donor showed a slightly increased IgG production after stimulation with PWM. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of four of the five HIV-seropositive individuals did not produce TT, or poliovirus-specific antibodies when stimulated with the respective T cell-dependent antigens. However, stimulation of these peripheral blood mononuclear cells with TT coupled to agarose beads, which was shown to be T cell-independent, resulted in the generation of IgG anti-TT antibody-forming cells.\r"

We have generated a monoclonal anti-HLA-B27 antibody in our laboratory and have used a radioimmunoassay to screen a panel of bacterial species. Two strains of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis were found to be highly reactive. The cross-reactive Yersinia component was identified by Western blot to be a 19,000 component. A preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis chromatography apparatus was constructed to isolate milligram quantities of this component. To verify that the component carried the HLA-B27-specific epitope, rabbits were hyperimmunized with the purified materials. Affinity-purified antibodies from one of the immunized rabbits indeed carried anti-HLA-B27 activity. Last, antibodies generated against synthetic peptides derived from the HLA-B27.1 amino acid sequence were tested against the Yersinia component. Positive reactivity was found with antibodies generated against a peptide spanning residues 69-83 of the HLA-B27.1 protein. Since this resides in the segment responsible for the allotypic specificity of the antigen, these experiments establish the presence of molecular mimicry to a high degree of confidence.\r"

Anti-Lyb8.2 antibody, reactive with the allelic Lyb8.2 murine B cell antigen, was labeled with 125I, and MOPC-21, an antibody with no known target antigen, was labeled with 131I. The two IgG or their fragments were co-injected, and all major organs were analyzed. Specific uptake of anti-Lyb8.2 IgG, F(ab')2, and Fab' was observed in the spleen with maximum peak values occurring at 1 to 2 hr. For MOPC-21, blood and organ kinetics was indicative of a nontargeted IgG molecule. The kidneys showed significant and rapid uptake of anti-Lyb8.2 and MOPC-21 Fab' fragments. This uptake by kidneys attenuated the maximum peak values of anti-Lyb8.2 Fab' in spleen. Multiexponential data fitting provided mean residence times (MRT) for each organ. The MRT for anti-Lyb8.2 in all organs were greater than those for its F(ab')2 and Fab' fragments. Only the kidneys showed greater MRT for Fab' than for F(ab')2. Blood, spleen, kidneys, and carcass exhibited substantial differences across fragments. When total body MRT for each fragment was compared with that of the respective parent IgG molecule, a progressive decline was observed. For MOPC-21, the decrease in total body MRT for F(ab')2 demonstrates the influence of the Fc portion of the molecule on IgG1 metabolism. This organ-by-organ data set may be pertinent to other monoclonal antibodies and their fragments and should help in optimizing delivery of these molecules to specific sites in vivo for immunologic and clinical purposes.\r"

Recipient naive mice were immunized with purified Ig or irradiated cells from these sources and were subsequently infected with viable parasites. Only preimmunization with T cell lines (hybridomas) led to exacerbation of parasite growth, although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays could detect the production of anti-idiotype antibodies in mAb (B cell hybridoma)-immunized mice. Either nylon wool-purified T cells or serum Ig from T cell-immunized mice could be used to immunize further naive recipients for protection against parasite growth.

The replication of HSV-1 was compared in undifferentiated U937 cells and U937 cells induced to undergo differentiation. Undifferentiated U937 cells were highly resistant to HSV-1 infection. Infectious virus levels declined rapidly to less than 0.1 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell by 24 hr postinfection and the cells were completely resistant to HSV-1-induced cytopathic effect. Differentiation of U937 cells by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was accompanied by a decrease in the resistance to HSV-1 infection. Infectious virus yields were increased greater than 75-fold at 24 hr postinfection, as compared with the undifferentiated U937 cells. PMA-differentiated U937 cells also acquired full susceptibility to HSV-1-induced cytopathic effect. Infectious center assay revealed that the percent of productively infected cells increased from approximately 3% in undifferentiated U937 to greater than 50% in PMA-differentiated cells. U937 cells were also induced to differentiate by treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, and lymphokine as shown by differentiation-associated changes in morphology and cytochemical enzymes. These cells, however, failed to display increased permissiveness for HSV-1, indicating that the change in permissiveness was uniquely associated with PMA treatment. Undifferentiated U937 cells adsorbed as much virus as PMA-differentiated cells, but immunofluorescence assays, as well as DNA hybridization analysis demonstrated that an early block in HSV-1 replication occurred in undifferentiated U937 cells, before synthesis of viral protein and DNA. PMA-induced differentiation of U937 cells appears to release an early block in HSV-1 replication that is present in undifferentiated U937 cells.\r"

By comparison, infection of mice with A-MuLV results primarily in the development of pre-B cell lymphomas. To determine whether A-MuLV could induce erythroid disease in vivo, NFS/N mice were pretreated with phenylhydrazine (PHZ) to stimulate erythropoiesis and increase the frequency of potential target cells for A-MuLV. No erythroleukemias developed in mice treated with PHZ. Instead, the latency for pre-B cell lymphomas was reduced by half. This acceleration of disease could be attributed to a marked increase in pre-B cells as targets for transformation by A-MuLV in the bone marrows but not the spleens of treated mice. Increases in the frequencies of T cells in bone marrow and spleen also followed treatment with PHZ. These results show that although PHZ-induced anemia stimulates the production of T and B cells as well as erythroid progenitors, PHZ-treated mice do not develop erythroleukemia or T cell lymphomas. It was also found that the genetically determined resistance of adult C57BL/6 mice to lymphoma induction by A-MuLV could not be overcome by pretreatment with PHZ even though the frequency of pre-B cells in bone marrow was greatly increased by this treatment.\r"

In this study, SLA was separated into nine distinct fractions by anion exchange liquid chromatography, and the fractions were analyzed for their ability to stimulate T cells obtained from immunized mice, to be recognized by vaccine-induced antibodies, and to induce protective immunity. While all but one of the fractions were recognized by antibodies from SLA + CP immunized mice, only two fractions (fractions 1 and 9) stimulated lymphocytes to produce macrophage-activating factor and elicited significant delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo. When mice were immunized with the fractions, only fraction 9 stimulated significant immunity (76% protection in seven experiments). Proteins (accounting for 1.3% of the total in SLA) appear to be responsible for the protection elicited with fraction 9, since protease treatment of this fraction destroyed its immunogenicity. Thus, a partially purified protective protein antigen fraction has been obtained and protection with this fraction correlated with cell-mediated immune responses. However, these results also demonstrate that the ability of leishmanial antigens to be recognized by T cells and produce macrophage-activating factor does not in itself predict whether such molecules will induce immunity, suggesting that protective leishmanial antigens may have additional unique properties.\r"

The genomic organizations of TCA3 was determined for two lambda phage clones and was found to be a single copy gene containing at least three exons dispersed over less than 4.7 kb. The temporal appearance of TCA3 mRNA in response to several activating agents was examined. It is not transcribed in response to interleukin 2 stimulation, but is transcribed in response to either antigen or Con A stimulation and can be detected as early as 1 hr poststimulation. Expression TCA3 in response to Con A is blocked by cyclosporin A treatment. The combined data suggest that TCA3 may represent a new lymphokine.\r"

Cells cocultivated in medium alone and with human fibroblast monolayers showed no change in surface phenotype. The malignant T cells from the leukemic CTCL patient failed to react in a mixed lymphocyte culture to lymphocytes from 2 different healthy donors, and showed no phenotypic change following culture with these lymphocytes, indicating that the phenotypic change seen was not due to allogeneic stimulation.\r"

Under various experimental conditions, methylprednisolone, doxorubicin, vincristine, and vinblastine each reduced lymphocyte proliferation of the PBMC exposed to influenza A virus antigen. Treatment of cells with these drugs did not reduce expression of influenza A virus antigens by PBMC as detected by flow cytometry and did not reduce cell viability. In vitro treatment of the cells with methylprednisolone and doxorubicin reduced interferon and interleukin-2 yields. Experimental conditions necessary to reduce lymphokine yields varied with the immunosuppressive drug tested. Vincristine and vinblastine treatment of the cells did not reduce interferon or interleukin-2 yields. We conclude that methylprednisolone and doxorubicin at clinically achievable concentrations significantly affected the response of PBMC to influenza A virus in vitro. The effects of these immunosuppressive agents on lymphokine production were different from those reported in previous studies in which mitogens and Newcastle disease virus were used as inducers. The sensitivity of PBMC to these immunosuppressive agents is clearly related to the inducing agent used.\r"

The median values of the concentrations of PAI 2 were 89, 13, and 75 micrograms/L, respectively. The HMW and LMW forms were found at about the same concentrations in amniotic fluid, but the LMW form predominated in cord blood, and the HMW form in maternal blood.

The ultimate effect of activated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells may be fibrotic lung injury. Inasmuch as pulmonary sarcoidosis is a disease associated with spontaneous activation of macrophages and lymphocytes among BAL cells, cells obtained from patients with sarcoidosis were compared with normal cells. We report that adherent BAL cells in culture from patients with sarcoidosis (n = 21) release during a resting period in vitro more chemotactic activity for neutrophils (PMNs) than do BAL cells from normal individuals (n = 14). After density fractionation of the respiratory cells by albumin gradient, cells from high-density fractions in the group with sarcoidosis secrete more chemotactic activity for neutrophils than cells from less dense fractions. The PMN chemotactic activity spontaneously released in vitro by BAL cells from patients with sarcoidosis correlates with the percentage of PMNs recovered by BAL. Immunochemical bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis of BAL cell supernatants revealed a complex pattern of chemotactic factors to be present. Generally, three peaks of chemotactic activity were noted on HPLC 1-60 separations at greater than 20 kd, 8 to 10 kd, and less than 1 kd apparent molecular weights. Significantly, interleukin-1 was present in these supernatants, whereas complement components and leukotriene B4 were absent. Sarcoid BAL cells, principally alveolar macrophages, are activated in vivo as manifested by spontaneous secretion of chemotactic factors for PMNs in vitro. Interleukin-1 and other less well characterized molecules were detected. The presence of PMNs among the lavage cells of some patients with sarcoidosis appears to be an in vivo biologic correlate of this activation. These data provide additional criteria of BAL cell activation in patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis and provide further evidence concerning factors that attract inflammatory cells into the lung.\r"

In tumor bilaterally significant reductions in absolute cerebellar metabolism also were noted, unlike stroke. Primary sensory stimulation did not alter absolute or relative cerebellar metabolism. These results show that absolute and relative values for cerebellar metabolism vary depending on the process under study. Thus analysis schemes employing normalization of regional metabolic data to cerebellar values may be subject to error.\r"

These are (1) that the blood-borne radioactivity component in the measured PET data is negligible, and (2) that differences in arrival time of the arterial bolus across the brain cause insignificant biases in the estimated cerebral blood flow (CBF) values. Biases in CBF values due to partial failure of these assumptions have been predicted by computer simulation studies and also quantitated for both dynamic and single scan PET methods using H2 15O. Both computer simulations and measured PET data indicate that these assumptions can sometimes cause significant errors in the estimated flow values. The magnitude of these errors depends on the PET technique used (dynamic or static) and on the interval of data included in the flow calculations. The bias caused when these assumptions fail can be considerably reduced by omitting approximately 40 sec of data immediately following tracer administration from the CBF calculations.\r"

Six dogs with oleic acid-induced lung injury confined to the left lower lobe, two normal human volunteers, and two patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were evaluated. Lung tissue-activity measurements were obtained from sequential 1-5 min PET scans collected over 60 min, after in vivo labeling of transferrin through intravenous administration of [68Ga]citrate. Blood-activity measurements were measured from simultaneously obtained peripheral blood samples. A forward rate constant describing the movement of transferrin from pulmonary vascular to extravascular compartments, the pulmonary transcapillary escape rate (PTCER), was then calculated from these data using a two-compartment model. In dogs, PTCER was 49 +/- 18 in normal lung tissue and 485 +/- 114 10(-4) min-1 in injured lung. A repeat study in these dogs 4 hr later showed no significant change. Values in the human subjects showed similarly marked differences between normal and abnormal lung tissue. We conclude that PET will be a useful method of evaluating vascular permeability changes after acute lung injury.\r"

Our tomographic results suggest that pulmonary perfusion in isogravitational planes is inherently nonuniform with preferential flow centrally and reduced circulation more peripherally. Planar imaging of the dissected isogravitational slices from the animals further confirmed the uneven perfusion noted on the tomographic slices.\r"

These findings support the assumption that HM-PAO allows monitoring of brain perfusion, as rapid changes of rCBF due to decreased neuronal activity cause respective alterations of cerebral and cerebellar uptake of this new brain agent.\r"

Thirty-three healthy infants received three sequential injections, and no serious side effects were observed. When Dpo20 was given with diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, the geometric mean titer of anticapsular antibody rose to 5.9 micrograms/ml at age 7 months. Dpo20 given at 3, 5, and 7 months raised the mean to 3.2 micrograms/ml at 7 months (after two injections) and 15.4 micrograms/ml at 10 months. The antibodies included IgG and were bactericidal in vitro. Thus, antibody activities potentially protective against invasive H. influenzae b infections were induced in the most susceptible age range.

HIV was isolated from PBMs from 16 (24%) of 66 patients with hemophilia who were seropositive for HIV and from none of six seronegative patients. Cells from five of six patients from which HIV was isolated were again successfully cultured for virus 3 to 12 months later. HIV core P24 antigen was detected in serum from seven of 15 patients with HIV-positive cells and from eight of 50 with HIV-negative cells. Patients with hemophilia with isolation-positive cells had significantly fewer T helper cells and significantly lower T helper/T suppressor ratios, pokeweed mitogen responsiveness, and total platelet counts than did those whose cells did not yield HIV on cultivation. HIV neutralizing antibody titers did not differ between hemophiliacs with or without HIV-positive PBMs. Three of the 16 patients with virus-positive cells developed AIDS, and two ARC, within 18 months of the study, compared with three of 50 seropositive hemophiliacs whose cells did not yield virus, who developed ARC during the same period. The significant decrease in the number of T helper cells, decreased platelet counts, and higher rate of progression to AIDS in the group with HIV isolation may reflect a heavier virus load, indicating that the ability to culture HIV may be an early marker of more significant disease.\r"

  ".W": "The previous finding that converting enzyme inhibitors (CEIs) potentiate bradykinin (BK), but do not inhibit conversion of angiotensin (ANG) I in isolated vessels, was explored further in the rat perfused mesenteric vascular bed. To investigate whether other peptidases besides angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) might be involved in CEI-resistant ANG I conversion, synthetic angiotensinogen fragments (1-14, 1-11 and 2-14) were studied. Their vasoconstrictor activities were found to be about 80 times less than that of ANG I, and were not altered by the CEI enalaprilat, indicating that tonin-like enzymes do not play a role in the generation of ANG II by the arterial wall. The hypothesis that BK potentiation by CEI in arteries might be due to a direct effect on the receptors was not supported by the lack of potentiation, by enalaprilat, of the vasorelaxant effect of Lys-Lys-BK (an ACE-resistant BK homologue). Finally, the effect of pH in the perfusing solution on ACE inhibition by enalaprilat was studied. Whereas converting activity decreased with increasing pH in the range 6.8 to 8.1, enalaprilat did not affect the responses to ANG I at pH 7.5 or 7.8, but blocked them at pH 7.1. Our results indicate that arterial ACE shows substrate-specific inhibition and that, at physiological pH, converting activity is resistant to inhibition by CEIs, whose hypotensive action would be due mainly to inhibition of arterial wall kininase activity.\r"

  ".W": "The present study examines the relaxant selectivity of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) released from cultured endothelial cells. Endothelial cells from bovine pulmonary artery (CCL-209) in culture were grown on Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads, packed into a column and superfused to release EDRF. EDRF response was estimated by its ability to relax phenylephrine-contracted rings of rabbit aorta. Bradykinin and A23187 (10(-10) to 10(-6) M) caused dose-dependent release of EDRF from cultured bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. The release was dependent on endothelial cell number. A23187 caused a larger and longer-lasting release of EDRF than bradykinin. EDRF relaxation was selective for blood vessels. EDRF relaxed rabbit aortic rings, but it did not relax histamine-contracted guinea pig tracheal, rabbit taenia coli strips or oxytocin-contracted guinea pig uterine rings. These nonvascular smooth muscles were, however, relaxed by isoproterenol (10(-4) M) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10(-5) M). The sensitivity of guinea pig aortic rings and tracheal strips to SNP were compared. The IC50 values for SNP (10(-9) to 10(-5) M) were 0.07 and 0.3 microM for aortic rings and tracheal strips, respectively. Although the tracheal strips were about 4-fold less sensitive than the aorta toward SNP, a complete relaxation was achieved. These results suggest that EDRF relaxes vascular smooth muscles but not respiratory, Gl or reproductive smooth muscles. Thus, EDRF may be a selective relaxant of vascular smooth muscle.\r"

Only the responses to PPD and in the AMLR were depressed. This was not due to suppression by OKT8 lymphocytes. The proportion of antigen responsive (T4+ 4B4+) cells was normal but suppressor-inducer (T4+ 2H4+) cells were decreased. The depressed response was not completely restored by addition of recombinant interleukin-2. We propose that a basic defect in rheumatoid arthritis resides in T lymphocytes which react to self-major histocompatibility complex antigens either on their own, as in the AMLR, or as restriction elements in the presentations of soluble antigen.\r"

Mean age of onset was 41.1 years in familial and 46.5 years in sporadic RA (p less than 0.0006); 67% of family probands, 74% of affected relatives and 57% of sporadic patients were HLA-DR4 positive (p less than 0.05 affected relatives vs sporadic).

None of 11 probands with more severe systemic sclerosis had HLA-DR5; all 11 had null alleles at the C4 loci. All but two of the probands had either HLA-DR5 or a C4 null allele, and this was also the case for the majority of the relatives with autoantibodies. Genetic markers of the major histocompatibility complex, including HLA-DR5 and C4 null alleles, appear to be closely associated with markers of disease in these probands and their families.\r"

  ".U": "88036279\r", 
  ".W": "It is often stated that unilateral testicular torsion results in damage to the contralateral testis; however, there are a growing number of experimental and clinical papers which suggest this is not so. Conflicting results from experimental studies confuse the issue and may be due, among other things, to some specifics of the experimental model. In the present paper, we have examined bilateral rat testes 30 and 60 days after 720 degrees torsion to determine 1) the effect of unilateral testicular torsion with and without the inclusion of epididymal torsion, 2) the effect of relatively chronic torsion (24 hr., 10 day) versus relatively acute torsion (two hr., four hr.), and 3) the effect of establishing the model using scrotal surgery versus using an abdominal approach. Bilateral testicular histology, testis wt. (gm.), cauda epididymal sperm concentrations (sp./ml.), and cauda sperm motility scores (0-4) were examined. Ipsilateral testicular torsion or testicular plus epididymal torsion of two hr. or four hr. duration significantly reduced (p less than .05) ipsilateral testis weights, sperm concentrations, and motility scores, and disrupted normal tissue histology. Contralateral testicles were not altered. Epididymal ischemia alone produced no significant ipsilateral or contralateral effects. Chronic torsion (one day, 10 days) also destroyed ipsilateral testis function without altering the contralateral testicles. The occult cryptorchidism associated with the scrotal approach to establishing the torsion model had no effect on contralateral testicles. In no group, using either Lewis rats or Sprague-Dawley rats, were contralateral testicles altered by unilateral testicular torsion. These results plus recent clinical reports indicate that contralateral testicular damage due to ipsilateral torsion is hardly a proven phenomenon, let alone a significant factor contributing to male infertility.\r"

  ".W": "Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is excreted in urine in high concentrations and thus incubates with bladder epithelial cells continuously. However, it is not known whether any urothelial cells can bind urinary EGF or respond to it. Using a monoclonal antibody (528) to the binding portion of the human EGF receptor, immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated that the basal cell layer of normal urothelium is richly endowed with cell surface EGF receptors while the superficial cell layer is not. Alternatively, superficial cells of premalignant and malignant urothelium have many surface EGF receptors. Intravesical EGF induces in vivo activity of ornithine decarboxylase and DNA synthesis in rat bladders, with nuclear thymidine incorporation being limited to the basal epithelial cell layer. These studies indicate that urothelium can respond to urinary EGF and that this response parallels the distribution of EGF receptors. These findings combined with the difference in EGF-receptor expression between malignant and normal cells indicate that urinary EGF may play a role in bladder tumor development and/or growth.\r"

Care was studied during 24 months before and 13 to 24 months after each consensus conference. Results showed that the conferences mostly failed to stimulate change in physician practice, despite moderate success in reaching the appropriate target audience. It was concluded that the consensus development conference is an important educational tool whose effects might be enhanced by focusing on areas of practice that need improvement and by encouraging follow-up programs at the state and local level.\r"

In cross-sectional data from the 2023 white men in NPHS, lifetime duration of smoking was a determinant of initial plasma fibrinogen levels. Fibrinogen levels had apparently begun to fall soon after smoking was discontinued but it was over 5 years before they had returned to levels found in life-long non-smokers. In prospective data, smoking cessation and the adoption or resumption of smoking were associated with a decrease or an increase, respectively, of about 0.15 g/l in plasma fibrinogen. These changes would lower or raise the risk of IHD by about 20%. A switch from cigarettes to cigars was associated with a large increase in fibrinogen. A substantial part of the relation between smoking and IHD appears to be mediated through the fibrinogen concentration. Following changes in body mass, VIIc rose in those who had given up smoking and fell in those who resumed.\r"

The success rate of preservation of hearing and facial nerve function was correlated with the size of the tumor. Useful hearing, as defined by speech reception threshold no poorer than 70 dB and a discrimination score of at least 15%, was preserved in 73% of cases in which the tumor extension to the posterior fossa was no greater than 0.5 cm. In contrast, useful hearing was preserved in 22% of cases in which posterior fossa extension was greater than 2.5 cm. No significant correlation was found between preoperative evoked responses and success in preservation of hearing. The techniques and value of intraoperative monitoring of electrocochleogram (ECoG) and brain stem evoked responses are discussed. A theory of pathogenesis of intraoperative hearing loss, based on correlation of changes in evoked responses and simultaneous surgical events, is presented.\r"

  ".W": "Although genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections occurring during pregnancy are known to be associated with neonatal and maternal complications, their frequency and contributing risk factors are not well understood. We prospectively followed 29 patients who acquired genital herpes during pregnancy, to evaluate the perinatal effects of the infection. The patients were classified on the basis of clinical or serologic criteria. Fifteen patients had a primary first episode of genital HSV Type 2 (HSV-2), and 14 had a nonprimary first episode. Although no patient had disseminated disease, 6 of the 15 with primary genital herpes but none of 14 with nonprimary first-episode infection had infants with serious perinatal morbidity (P less than 0.01). Four of the five infants whose mothers acquired primary HSV-2 in the third trimester had perinatal morbidity such as prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, and neonatal infection with HSV-2. Perinatal complications occurred in one of five infants whose mothers acquired primary HSV-2 during the first trimester, as well as in one of five infants whose mothers had primary HSV-2 during the second trimester. Asymptomatic cervical shedding of HSV-2 was detected at 10.6 percent of weekly visits made after a primary first episode, as compared with 0.5 percent of visits after a nonprimary first episode (P less than 0.01). We conclude that infants born to women who acquire primary genital herpes during pregnancy are at high risk of exposure to HSV, either during premature labor at the time of the primary episode or subsequently because of asymptomatic cervical shedding of the virus. The 40 percent incidence of serious perinatal morbidity in such women suggests that studies of preventive measures such as the use of antiviral chemotherapy are warranted.\r"

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing CD2 can either block adhesion or, in certain combinations, induce an antigen-independent T cell activation. We have identified the binding sites for 16 monoclonal antibodies against CD2 by a rapid and generally applicable mutational analysis. The binding sites fall in three discrete regions: antibodies that participate in activation and block erythrocyte adhesion bind to the first region; antibodies that block adhesion bind to the second region; and antibodies that participate in activation but do not block adhesion bind to the third region. A large number of mutations selected for loss of antibody reactivity in the first two regions also weaken the CD2-LFA-3 interaction. Good agreement was observed between mutational lesions blocking LFA-3 binding and lesions blocking binding by activating antibodies, which supports the view that such antibodies induce T cell activation by mimicking the effect of LFA-3 binding. CD2 sequences that participate in LFA-3 binding correspond to immunoglobulin variable region hypervariable sequences when the homologous domains are aligned.\r"

  ".W": "Although the regeneration of nervous tissue in the vertebrate is very limited, there are a few remarkable examples of this process. Understanding the factors that regulate CNS regeneration in those areas of the nervous system where it occurs, will doubtless provide generally applicable, essential information about the process. It has been known for some time that the amphibian retina regenerates following its destruction. Transplant studies, confirmed later by in vitro experiments, have shown that one source of new neurons in regenerating retina is the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). RPE cells can transdifferentiate to either neurons or lens cells in culture, but little is known about the factors that regulate this process. A recent study in vivo of retinal regeneration provided evidence that the association of RPE cells with the retinal vascular membrane is an important step in transdifferentiation. We report here that transdifferentiation in vitro is profoundly influenced by the substrate on which the cells are cultured; RPE cells plated on laminin-containing substrates frequently transdifferentiate into neurons. In addition, we have found a high concentration of laminin in the Rana retinal vascular membrane. Therefore, we propose that retinal regeneration is initiated by changes in the composition of the extracellular matrix that RPE cells contact early in the process.\r"

  ".W": "Changes in intracellular free Ca2+ are involved in the transmembrane signalling of different cells, including lymphocytes. Since calmodulin (CaM) is a primary receptor for Ca2+ (ref. 4), it may mediate the activation of crucial enzymes after antigen-induced increases in cytosolic Ca2+. Using a biotinylated-CaM (Bio-CaM) detection procedure to identify such proteins, we found that a peptide of relative molecular mass 59,000 (59K) was the predominant soluble CaM-binding protein (CaM-BP) in T cells and B lymphocytes from murine spleen; immunoblotting experiments identified it as a subunit of the CaM-dependent phosphatase, 'calcineurin' (CN). Smaller amounts of larger CaM-BPs, thought to be cytoskeletal-binding proteins, were also detected. CaM-BPs were expressed differentially, with B lymphocytes having four times more of the CN-like protein than T lymphocytes, while in thymocytes, a 65K polypeptide was the major CaM-BP. However, limited proteolysis analysis suggested that this thymus-specific peptide may be a precursor of CN. These data suggest that Ca2+-stimulated protein dephosphorylation may be an important and highly regulated function in lymphoid cells.\r"

Recent studies suggest that immature thymocytes are immunologically unresponsive. We have suggested that an early step in signal transduction following engagement of the T cell receptor might differ in immature and mature T cells. Here we examine anti-receptor antibody mediated induction of calcium mobilization in immature and mature T cells. Results indicate that antigen receptors on both immature and mature receptor-positive T cells transduce signals via calcium mobilization. Significant differences were observed, however, between these populations in the magnitude of influx of extracellular Ca2+ following binding of antireceptor antibody. Specifically immature cells show a much reduced Ca2+ influx response compared to mature cells which could result from a low Ca2+ channel frequency in the plasma membranes of immature T cells, or from less efficient activation of existing channels.\r"

  ".W": "The CD4 glycoprotein is expressed on T-helper and cytotoxic lymphocytes which are restricted to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on target cells. Antibody inhibition studies imply that CD4 acts to increase the avidity of effector-target cell interactions. These observations have led to the speculation that CD4 binds to a monomorphic class II antigen determinant, thereby augmenting low affinity T-cell receptor-antigen interactions. However, no direct evidence has been presented indicating that CD4 and class II molecules interact. To address this issue, we have used a vector derived from simian virus 40 (SV40) to express a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding the human CD4 glycoprotein. When CV1 cells expressing large amounts of the CD4 protein at the cell surface are incubated with human B cells bearing MHC-encoded class II molecules, they are bound tightly to the infected monolayer, whereas mutant B cells which lack class II molecules fail to bind. Furthermore, the binding reaction is specifically inhibited by anti-class II and anti-CD4 antibodies. Thus, the CD4 protein, even in the absence of T-cell receptor-antigen interactions, can interact directly with class II antigens to function as a cell surface adhesion molecule.\r"

TCR gamma delta is expressed on CD3+ thymocytes during fetal ontogeny before the appearance of TCR alpha-beta (alpha beta) (refs 5-7), on CD3+CD4-CD8- adult thymocytes, and on a subset (1-10%) of CD3+ cells in adult peripheral lymphoid organs and the peripheral blood. TCR gamma delta-expressing T cells probably represent a distinct mature T-cell lineage with the capacity to proliferate in response to receptor-mediated signals, and to display non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytolysis. Critical to understanding the function of this T-cell subset is the identification of the ligand(s) recognized by TCR gamma delta. Here we describe an alloreactive CD3+CD4-CD8-TCR gamma delta-expressing, TCR alpha beta-negative, T-cell line that manifests MHC-linked recognition specificity for both proliferation and cytotoxicity. Our results suggest that T cells expressing TCR gamma delta are capable of self-non-self MHC discrimination and that they can undergo MHC-influenced selection during differentiation like TCR alpha beta-expressing T cells.\r"

After recovery from the surgical procedure and the development of spasticity, each animal participated in several trials of spinal cord stimulation (SCS). Cord stimulation was provided above or below the level of injury using currents of less than 0.75 mA at 100 Hz. Electromyogram changes in hamstring and quadricep muscles (during spasms induced by dorsiflexion of the paw) were monitored. All animals showed complete paraplegia and, at 3 weeks, severe spasms. Spasticity was aggravated by SCS delivered above the level of injury. Spasms were markedly suppressed by monopolar stimulation delivered below the level of the lesion. Effects were maximal with the negative electrode applied to the cord and were slightly less with reversal of polarity. Muscle excitation was seen before diminution of spasms when bipolar currents were used. All effects lasted only as long as currents were delivered. These animal trials suggest that the effects of SCS are directly related to the current and its type. Beneficial effects were seen only when currents were delivered below the level of injury; this suggests that SCS activates local inhibitory processes or depolarizes local excitatory pathways. The poor results with bipolar stimulation do not support action on a multisynaptic cord system in short term stimulation.\r"

Patients with lymphomas composed of nontransformed follicular center cells had a greater mean age than those with tumors of transformed follicular center cells or postfollicular cells, and a trend of decreasing age with increasing B cell transformation of the tumor type was seen. Within each Lukes-Collins category, the percentage of tumors that presented with bone involvement increased as the tumor category advanced in B cell transformation.

  ".W": "The synthesis of retroviral polyproteins that are the translational products of the genome-size mRNA is initiated in the upstream gag gene. The synthesis of the products of the protease gene (pro) and polymerase gene (pol) is regulated by translational suppression (in-frame read-through or frameshift) of termination codons as a strategy developed for controlling the level of replicative enzymes required only in catalytic amounts. In mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), three overlapping reading frames are utilized for the synthesis of gag-encoded Pr77, gag-pro-encoded Pr110, and gag-pro-pol-encoded Pr160 polyproteins. To characterize pro gene products and to determine the site of frameshift required for the synthesis of Pr110, we purified and sequenced three MMTV proteins: p14, p30, and p13. Sequence analysis showed that p14 is the basic nucleic acid-binding protein derived entirely from gag, and p13 is a product of the pro gene and has characteristic sequences of protease. A comparison of the amino acid sequences of p30 with the corresponding nucleotide sequence of proviral DNA allowed the delineation of the frameshift site utilized in vivo for the synthesis of the gag-pro-encoded fusion polyprotein Pr110. The results showed that: (i) the N-terminal 94 residues of p30 are translated from the gag frame; (ii) residue leucine-95 is specified by either the last UUG codon of gag or the overlapping CUU codon in the pro frame; and (iii) the elongation of the peptide chain from residue 96 continued to be encoded in the pro frame to the pro terminator. The possible mechanisms of frameshift and of the tRNAs involved are discussed.\r"

We report that alpha-trans-induction factor, synthesized in vitro or present in nuclear extracts of infected cells, forms complexes with viral DNA fragments containing its cis-acting site only in the presence of cellular proteins and only under conditions that also enable the binding of the alpha H1 protein to the DNA. The induction of alpha genes by alpha-trans-induction factor appears, therefore, to be mediated by the interaction of the viral protein with cellular proteins at its cis-acting site.\r"

  ".W": "The human bladder carcinoma cell line 5637 produces hematopoietic growth factors [granulocyte and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF)] and hemopoietin 1, which synergizes with CSFs to stimulate colony formation by primitive hematopoietic stem cells in 5-fluorouracil-treated mouse bone marrow. Molecular and functional properties of hemopoietin 1 identified it as identical to interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha). When bone marrow cells from 5-fluorouracil-treated mice were cultured in suspension for 7 days with recombinant human IL-1 alpha and/or G-CSF, it was found that the two factors synergized to enhance recovery of myelopoietic cells and colony-forming cells of both high and low proliferative potential. G-CSF alone did not sustain these populations, but the combination had greater-than-additive stimulating capacity. In vivo, 5-fluorouracil (150 mg/kg) produced profound myelosuppression and delayed neutrophil regeneration for up to 2 weeks in C3H/HeJ mice. Daily administration of recombinant human G-CSF or recombinant human IL-1 alpha accelerated recovery of stem cells, progenitor cells, and blood neutrophils by up to 4 days in 5-fluorouracil-treated C3H/HeJ and B6D2F1 mice. The combination of IL-1 alpha and G-CSF acted synergistically, reducing neutropenia and accelerating recovery of normal neutrophil numbers by up to 7 days. This was accompanied by accelerated regeneration of spleen colony-forming units and erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic progenitor cells in marrow and spleen, with enhanced erythroid and granulocytic differentiation. These results indicate the possible therapeutic potential of combination therapy with IL-1 and hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF in the treatment of chemotherapy- or radiation-induced myelosuppression.\r"

  ".W": "We have isolated bovine and human adrenal cDNA clones encoding the adrenal cytochrome P-450 specific for 11 beta-hydroxylation (P450c11). A bovine adrenal cDNA library constructed in the bacteriophage lambda vector gt10 was probed with a previously isolated cDNA clone corresponding to part of the 3' untranslated region of the 4.2-kilobase (kb) mRNA encoding P450c11. Several clones with 3.2-kb cDNA inserts were isolated. Sequence analysis showed that they overlapped the original probe by 300 base pairs (bp). Combined cDNA and RNA sequence data demonstrated a continuous open reading frame of 1509 bases. P450c11 is predicted to contain 479 amino acid residues in the mature protein in addition to a 24-residue amino-terminal mitochondrial signal sequence. A bovine clone was used to isolate a homologous clone with a 3.5-kb insert from a human adrenal cDNA library. A region of 1100 bp was 81% homologous to 769 bp of the coding sequence of the bovine cDNA except for a 400-bp segment presumed to be an unprocessed intron. Hybridization of the human cDNA to DNA from a panel of human-rodent somatic cell hybrid lines and in situ hybridization to metaphase spreads of human chromosomes localized the gene to the middle of the long arm of chromosome 8. These data should be useful in developing reagents for heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis of 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency, the second most frequent cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.\r"

  ".W": "The administration of dextran-conjugated cytosine arabinonucleoside (araC) to BALB/c mice at various times prior to but not subsequent to immunization with native dextran renders mice unresponsive to this thymic-independent antigen. These results demonstrate that the primary immune response to an antigen can be selectively and efficiently suppressed or eliminated in vivo by the delivery of a single dose of an appropriate antigen-cytotoxic drug conjugate. Evidence presented here indicates that the dextran-araC conjugate (toxogen) acts directly and selectively upon unprimed dextran-specific antibody-forming cell precursors, presumably by binding to their receptors and subsequent internalization of the resultant receptor-toxogen complexes. The resistance of antigen-primed mice to the cytotoxic effect of the toxogen could result from the failure of dextran-primed cells to reexpress antigen-specific receptors, from an alternative processing of the toxogen, or from the inability of the antigen-primed cells to internalize a second round of receptor-ligand complexes. We also determined that B cells responding to thymic-dependent antigens were not affected by the prior exposure to a toxogen. The inability to eliminate or suppress the primary response to a thymic-dependent antigen via the administration of a cytotoxic drug-antigen conjugate distinguishes the thymic-independent set of B cells from the thymic-dependent B-cell repertoire. The difference between these two B-cell compartments could be due either to differences in the amount of ligand bound to receptors or to differences in the trafficking patterns of receptor-ligand complexes within each cell type.\r"

Due to its extreme hydrophobicity, purified p15E has not been available in a nondenatured form or in sufficient quantities for detailed studies on the mechanisms of its immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, a plasmid was constructed to direct the synthesis in Escherichia coli of the major hydrophilic region of murine p15E. The purified recombinant p15E derivative, soluble under physiological conditions, inhibited by up to 60% (EC50 = 7.5 nM) the anti-CD3-driven proliferation of human T lymphocytes but had no effect on the proliferation of the transformed T-cell line Jurkat. The recombinant protein also inhibited, by up to an average of 92% (EC50 = 2.1 microM), the proliferation of the murine T-cell line CTLL-2. These data (i) provide direct evidence that a retroviral envelope protein can itself inhibit lymphoproliferative function and (ii) map the inhibitory activity to a specific region of p15E. The availability of soluble, recombinant p15E should facilitate studies of the pathogenesis of the immunosuppression accompanying retroviral infections and neoplastic diseases.\r"

DNA sequence analyses revealed that mouse and human cDNA clones encode proteins of 133 and 134 amino acids, respectively, that are identical to cDNA clones encoding the T-cell replacing factor I and B-cell growth factor II activities.

To define the mechanism by which HSV-1 stimulates the HIV LTR, we examined the effects of isolated regulatory genes from HSV-1. The results of cotransfection assays with the immediate-early (IE) genes of HSV-1, IE110 (ICP0) and IE175 (ICP4), showed that the IE110 protein, either alone or in combination with the IE175 protein, can activate the HIV LTR. Cotransfection with the IE175 gene alone or with the Vmw65 gene (coding for a virion transcription factor) alone did not lead to HIV-LTR activation. The lack of requirement for the IE175 or Vmw65 gene products in transient-expression assays was confirmed in permanent cell lines containing the HIV-LTR/CAT hybrid gene by using temperature-sensitive mutants defective in the IE175 gene product or in uncoating functions. By deletion analysis, we localized a 73-bp-long region (positions -104 to -32) from the HIV LTR that responded to HSV-1 activation; when this region, which is distinct from the previously identified trans-activating responsive (TAR) region, was ligated to a heterologous, HSV-1-nonresponsive gene (alpha 4-interferon/CAT), it conferred inducibility by both HSV-1 infection and IE110/175 cotransfection. Both simian and human cytomegalovirus also induced the HIV-LTR/CAT hybrid gene. However, we failed to detect specific upstream sequence requirements for induction by cytomegalovirus. Our results indicate that infection with unrelated viruses can alter the expression of HIV in an infected cell.\r"

In the present study, we sought to determine whether some of these cell lines produce transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). Utilizing a radiolabeled TGF-alpha cDNA in hybridization experiments, we determined that ASPC-1, T3M4, PANC-1, COLO-357, and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines expressed TGF-alpha mRNA. Serum-free medium conditioned by T3M4 and ASPC-1 cells contained significant amounts of TGF-alpha protein. Although unlabeled TGF-alpha readily competed with 125I-labeled EGF for binding, each cell line exhibited lower surface binding and internalization of 125I-labeled TGF-alpha as compared to 125I-labeled EGF. Both TGF-alpha and EGF significantly enhanced the anchorage-independent growth of PANC-1, T3M4, and ASPC-1 cells. However, TGF-alpha was 10- to 100-fold more potent than EGF. These findings suggest that the concomitant overexpression of EGF receptors and production of TGF-alpha may represent an efficient mechanism for certain cancer cells to obtain a growth advantage.\r"

A 16-kilobase plasmid containing the gene for immobilization antigen A from Paramecium tetraurelia, stock 51, was injected into the macronucleus of deletion mutant d12, which lacks that gene. Approximately 40% of the injected cells acquired the ability to express serotype A at 34 degrees C. Expression appeared to be regulated normally. The transformed cells, like wild type, could be switched to serotype B by antiserum treatment and culture at 19 degrees C; on transfer to 34 degrees C, they switched back to serotype A expression. Many of the lines retained the ability to express serotype A until autogamy, when the old macronucleus is replaced by a new one derived from the micronucleus. DNA from transformants contained the injected plasmid sequences, which were replicated within the paramecia. No evidence for integration was obtained. The majority of replicated plasmid DNA comigrated with a linearized form of the input plasmid. Nonetheless, the pattern of restriction fragments generated by transformant DNA and that generated by input plasmid DNA are identical and consistent with a circular rather than a linear map. These conflicting observations can be reconciled by assuming that a mixture of different linear fragments is present in the transformants, each derived from the circular plasmid by breakage at a different point. Copy-number determinations suggest the presence of 45,000-135,000 copies of the injected plasmid per transformed cell. These results suggest that the injected DNA contains information sufficient for both controlled expression and autonomous replication in Paramecium.\r"

Only those transfectants that express both the introduced genes (alpha and beta) contributed by the normal T cell can respond specifically to the appropriate antigen/MHC pair. None of the transfectants that express only one of the introduced genes (alpha or beta) of the normal T cell, or paired hybrid genes (i.e., one gene from the normal T cell and the other from the fusion partner), can respond to the same combination of antigen and MHC product recognized by the donor T cell. However, one clone expressing the transfected genes that encode the alpha and beta chains of the fusion partner shows reactivity to the antigen-presenting cells even in the absence of the antigens. These data suggest that the alpha beta heterodimer of the T-cell receptor is required to define the fine specificity of a T cell.\r"

We and others propose the designation interleukin 6 (IL-6) for the latter molecule. Our experiments demonstrate that either murine TAF or human IL-6 can restore the ability of purified T cells to proliferate in response to Con A or antibodies against the T-cell antigen receptor. Most if not all of the proliferation can be blocked by antibodies against the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor. Furthermore, highly purified CD8- T cells can be activated by IL-6 in the presence of Con A to secrete IL-2. We propose that IL-6 and murine TAF are important \"second signals\" in primary antigen-receptor-dependent T-cell activation. Whether or not murine TAF is a homologue of human IL-6 remains to be determined.\r"

Mouse CD4 (L3T4) has previously been shown to be evolutionarily related to immunoglobulin variable regions based on the predicted protein sequence from cDNA clones. The gene encoding L3T4 was found to be transcribed not only in a subset of T-lineage cells but also unexpectedly in brain, where a shorter transcript was found. In the present study the gene encoding L3T4 is shown to span 26 kilobases and to contain 10 exons. The structural organization is similar to that of other members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily except for the striking presence of an intron in the middle of the sequence encoding the amino-terminal immunoglobulin-like homology unit. The structure of the shorter L3T4 transcript in mouse brain has been determined. This mRNA appears to be generated from a transcriptional start site within the coding sequence in exon VI. If translated, this transcript would encode a protein of 217 amino acids that lacks the usual L3T4 signal peptide and the amino-terminal 214 amino acids of the mature protein.\r"

These in vitro properties suggest that PDGF, delivered by platelets to the site of injury in vivo, may play an important role in the initiation of the wound repair process. Studies presented here show that the addition of pure PDGF to a wound site involving the epidermis and dermis has little effect on the morphology or biochemistry of the healing wound. In contrast, the addition of partially purified PDGF resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in the width of the newly synthesized connective tissue and epidermal layers. Autoradiography using [3H]thymidine revealed increased numbers of labeled cells in the new connective tissue and epithelial layers. Furthermore, addition of partially purified PDGF resulted in significant increases in the rate of protein and DNA synthesis and the total content of these components in biopsies taken from the wound site. Similar effects were obtained when insulin-like growth factor I was added in combination with pure PDGF. This combination of factors caused a 2.4-fold increase in the width of the newly formed connective tissue layer and a 95% increase in epidermal thickness compared with controls. Insulin-like growth factor I alone caused no significant morphologic changes. Epidermal growth factor alone or in combination with PDGF resulted in a thickening only of the epidermis. These results indicate that the synergistic actions of other factors with PDGF are important in the modulation of the wound healing process.\r"

Phosphorothioate analogs complementary to HIV sequences, as well as noncomplementary analogs including homooligomers, exhibited potent antiviral activity. The antiviral activity was related to the base composition of the analogs, and longer phosphorothioates were more effective than shorter ones. A 28-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxycytidine (S-dC28) at a concentration of 1 microM exhibited potent antiviral activity and inhibited de novo viral DNA synthesis as shown by Southern blot analysis. However, S-dC28 failed to inhibit gag expression in chronically infected T cells assessed by immunofluorescent assay at concentrations up to 25 microM. An N3-methylthymidine-containing phosphorothioate analog, which does not hybridize efficiently in vitro to complementary normal DNA, showed no antiviral activity. A 14-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxycytidine (S-dC14) synergistically enhanced the antiviral activity of 2',3'-dideoxyadenosine, an anti-HIV nucleoside. Therefore, phosphorothioate analogs of oligodeoxynucleotides could represent a unique class of experimental therapeutic agents against the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and related diseases. However, their mechanism of action is likely to be complex.\r"

Oocytes expressing either alpha 3 or alpha 4 protein in combination with the beta 2 protein produced a strong response to acetylcholine. Oocytes expressing only the alpha 4 protein gave a weak response to acetylcholine. These receptors are activated by acetylcholine and nicotine and are blocked by Bungarus toxin 3.1. They are not blocked by alpha-bungarotoxin, which blocks the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Thus, the receptors formed by the alpha 3, alpha 4, and beta 2 subunits are pharmacologically similar to the ganglionic-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. These results indicate that the alpha 3, alpha 4, and beta 2 genes encode functional nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits that are expressed in the brain and peripheral nervous system.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of our study was to determine head and trunk movement responses that occur in healthy 7-year-old children during induced and self-induced lateral tilt. Twenty subjects, while tailor sitting on a tiltboard, participated in three trials of both induced and self-induced left and right lateral displacements. Measurements of neck and trunk lateral flexion; trunk counterrotation; and neck, trunk, and body anterior-posterior movement were obtained from slide transparencies made at three stages of tilt (original position, initial tilt, and full tilt). For each subject in the two test conditions, changes in these measurements between the stages of tilt were determined and compared. Based on the results of multivariate analysis of variance procedures, we concluded that 1) a significant difference in trunk counterrotation existed between the two types of tilt, with the greatest degree of counterrotation occurring with induced displacement; 2) no significant difference existed in neck or trunk lateral flexion; and 3) no significant differences existed in neck, trunk, or body anterior-posterior movement between tilts. We also found that a wide variability of response existed among the children over the three testing trials. Clinical application of our results suggests that different and unique motor programs exist for automatic and willed balance responses. These differences should be considered when planning treatment strategies.\r"

The animals in the treated group were treated with HVS at 24, 48, and 72 hours posttrauma. Paw volume measurements were made on all animals at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours posttrauma. In addition, the paw volume was measured in the treated group both before and after HVS. The results showed that animals in both groups had a significant decrease in paw volume over the experimental period, but no significant difference was found between the two groups in the amount of edema reduction. The HVS treatment did not produce a significant change in paw volume immediately after treatment.\r"

T cell-specific complementary DNA clones present in a human TCR gamma delta T cell complementary DNA library were obtained and characterized in order to identify candidate clones encoding TCR delta. One cross-hybridizing group of clones detected transcripts that are expressed in lymphocytes bearing TCR gamma delta but not in other T lymphocytes and are encoded by genes that are rearranged in TCR gamma delta lymphocytes but deleted in other T lymphocytes. Their sequences indicate homology to the variable, joining, and constant elements of other TCR and immunoglobulin genes. These characteristics, as well as the immunochemical data presented in a companion paper, are strong evidence that the complementary DNA clones encode TCR delta.\r"

A nuclear protein was found in hepatocytes, but not other cell types, that binds to a sequence required for hepatocyte-specific transcription of the gene for the beta chain of fibrinogen. This protein, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1), also interacts with homologous sequences required for optimal promoter function of the genes for the alpha chain of fibrinogen and alpha 1-antitrypsin. The promoter or enhancer regions for several viral and cellular genes not expressed in the liver did not compete for this binding. The restricted expression of HNF1 and its selective interaction with the control regions of several liver-specific genes indicate that it is involved in developmentally regulated gene expression in the liver.\r"

Because isolation of the gene is requisite to understanding the molecular details of this regulation, transposon mutagenesis with the transposable element suppressor-mutator (Spm) was carried out, and three mutable o2 alleles were obtained. One of these alleles contained an 8.3-kilobase autonomous Spm, another a 6.8-kilobase nonautonomous Spm, and the third an unidentified transposon that is unrelated to Spm. A DNA sequence flanking the autonomous Spm insertion was verified to be o2-specific and provided a probe to clone a wild-type allele. Northern blots indicated that the gene is expressed in wild-type endosperm but not in leaf tissues or in endosperms homozygous for a mutant allele of the O2 gene. A transcript was detected in endosperms homozygous for mutations at opaque-7 and floury-2, an indication that O2 expression is independent of these two other putative regulators of zein synthesis.\r"

In a prospective study of 403 normal fetuses whose gestational ages were between 14 and 42 weeks, two-dimensional (2D) real-time and M-mode echocardiography were used to measure the diameters of the aortic root and the pulmonary artery in utero. The goals were to establish norms for the diameters of these structures as a function of both gestational age and biparietal diameter, to compare measurements obtained in systole and diastole, and to compare 2D and M-mode measurements. A high correlation was found between measurements made during systole and diastole (r = .994 for aorta, r = .996 for pulmonary artery) and between 2D and M-mode measurements for each vessel (r = .992 for aorta, r = .973 for pulmonary artery). The differences between systolic and diastolic measurements and between M-mode and 2D measurements were small (2.2-4.6%) for both the aorta and the pulmonary artery. The norms established here provide an objective standard for comparison when a cardiac anomaly involving a fetal aorta or pulmonary artery of abnormal size is suspected. The results indicate that a sonographic facility need not have M-mode equipment to obtain technically adequate measurements.\r"

Hydrocephalus with or without an associated lesion was also noted. MR determined the presence of disease in all patients (100%), but was less accurate than CT in depicting disease in two patients (14%). CT determined the presence of disease in 12 patients (85%) and was less accurate than MR in delineating hypothalamic involvement in two patients and periventricular white-matter disease in three patients. There was great variability in the appearance of intracranial sarcoidosis on MR. Three patients had lesions that were isointense or hypointense (relative to cerebral cortex) on both T1- and T2-weighted images while nine patients had lesions that were hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Convexity involvement and hydrocephalus were well documented by both CT and MR. These results indicate that both MR and CT are helpful in fully evaluating a patient with suspected intracranial sarcoidosis.\r"

The cost-efficiency and productivity of the department have been compared with other teaching hospitals in Ontario, the basis for the comparison being the Canadian workload system, which compares units of work. Nonmedical productivity and cost-efficiency are shown to be improved by a factor of 30-60%, with financial savings amounting to about 25% of the total budget.\r"

  ".W": "Metastatic calcification of the lung and heart can cause severe cardiopulmonary compromise and death. Although it is found in most end-stage renal disease patients at autopsy, it is only rarely detected during life. Using a prototype dual-energy digital chest radiographic unit, we measured calcium content (mg/cm2) over the lung and heart in 32 hemodialysis patients. Pulmonary calcium content was significantly greater in these patients than in sex-matched control subjects (men, 230 +/- 43 [mean +/- standard error] vs 166 +/- 7, p less than .05; women, 168 +/- 19 vs 110 +/- 7.5, p less than .001). Abnormal values were detected by dual-energy radiography in 44% of patients (vs 9% of patients studied by conventional radiography). Cardiac calcium content was also significantly greater in the hemodialysis patients than in the control subjects (259 +/- 14 vs 184 +/- 8, p less than .05). Metastatic calcification was significantly correlated with elevated phosphate and calcium-phosphate product levels. Patients with significantly elevated pulmonary calcium content had evidence of restrictive lung disease by functional testing. There was an inverse correlation between elevated cardiac calcium content and ejection fraction. We conclude that dual-energy digital radiography allows premortem diagnosis of metastatic visceral calcification and is more sensitive than current techniques.\r"

These radiographic findings were encountered in eight adult patients with homozygous sickle-cell disease. In one patient, the masses encompassed essentially the entire thoracic paravertebral area bilaterally. In the other seven patients, the masses were unilateral and limited to the region of the eighth to the 12th thoracic vertebrae. Two of the eight patients had lateral subpleural masses that were not contiguous with the paraspinal masses and that were located medial to the lateral portions of the ribs. Follow-up in seven of the cases ranged from 2 to 15 years and demonstrated, after relatively rapid growth initially, either no change in size or slow growth. Each patient was asymptomatic with regard to the thoracic masses. Histologic verification was not available in any case because of the lack of clinical indication for invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. The presence of well-defined unilateral or bilateral paraspinal masses and/or paracostal masses in patients with homozygous sickle-cell disease and without related symptoms should alert one to the possibility of the presence of extramedullary hematopoiesis. These masses tend to be slow-growing and should not be subjected to aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures.\r"

Overall, 18 (60%) of the 30 patients were found to have a mass lesion. The lesion was confirmed by biopsy, surgery, or unequivocal demonstration on CT, 2D echocardiography, and/or MR imaging. Fourteen of the lesions were soft-tissue or tumor masses, and four were thrombi. The findings on 2D echocardiography and MR were in agreement in 17 (65%) of 26 patients who had both studies. MR was equivocal or in error in two patients (7%), and 2D echocardiography was nondiagnostic in seven (27%). In all seven patients with equivocal 2D echocardiography, the diagnosis was made by MR. In the four patients who did not have 2D echocardiography, MR showed the mass clearly. MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of cardiac mass lesions. It can be used effectively in addition to 2D echocardiography to increase the certainty of diagnosis, and it is useful when 2D echocardiography is equivocal or inadequate.\r"

One infrequent but life-threatening complication is false aneurysm formation associated with rupture or dissection of the pulmonary artery. We report 10 cases of catheter-induced pulmonary artery false aneurysms identified during a 9-year period. Initial presentation was radiologic in six patients and clinical (hemoptysis) in four. Later chest radiographic findings consisted of a well-defined, persistent pulmonary nodule or mass (three patients) or focal, dense parenchymal consolidation (six patients) that either persisted (two patients) or evolved into a nodule or mass (four patients) adjacent to the catheter tip. Cavitation of a pulmonary mass developed in one case. Two of eight deaths were caused by pulmonary artery false aneurysm formation and rupture with subsequent fatal hemorrhage. In one patient who survived, the false aneurysm was shown by pulmonary angiography and embolized with coils and Gelfoam. We conclude that pulmonary artery false aneurysms are life-threatening complications of pulmonary artery catheters and have characteristic chest radiographic findings.\r"

After intensive training in mammographic interpretation, four PAs individually interpreted 727 mammograms of 470 normal breasts, 75 breasts with benign breast masses, and 182 breasts with cancer. The interpretations by the PAs were more sensitive and as specific as those made by six HMO radiologists who interpreted the same cases, and as effective as those by radiologists described in the literature. In receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis, the areas under curves for PAs were larger than those under curves for radiologists. Interpretations by PAs took less time and cost less than did those by radiologists; the dispositions recommended by PAs were similar to those recommended by radiologists. We conclude that properly trained, evaluated, and supervised PAs can interpret mammograms. Legal, practical, and ethical considerations dictate that this can best be accomplished under the direction of radiologists who are well trained in mammography.\r"

Eight automatic exposure control systems on five models were tested by measuring the optical density produced by imaging at 28 and 30 kVp, with and without a grid and with test objects of varying thicknesses of BR12 epoxy material. Comparable mean glandular dose for a 4-cm-thick BR12 test object was measured for 13 of the units under manual or automatic exposures. Nominal focal-spot size was larger than stated for six of the 15 large focal spots and for seven of the 12 microfocal spots. Comparable doses under automatic exposure control varied more than 100% between units from different manufacturers, while the doses of units from the same manufacturer varied less than 20%. Automatic exposure control systems were operational in eight of the 15 units, but four of these eight were found to be out of calibration. There are considerable performance variations that need to be evaluated before acceptance and use of new mammographic equipment.\r"

A review of the radiographic features of 16 proved cases of cytomegalovirus esophagitis showed a spectrum of abnormalities related to the severity of the inflammatory process. Seven patients had a mild form of esophagitis with segmental involvement characterized by granular mucosa, superficial erosions, and poorly defined, shallow ulcerations. Nine patients had more severe esophagitis with solitary or multiple deep ulcers and a background of normal mucosa. The deep ulcerations were oval in shape and varied in size. Some projected intraluminally and had a thin rim of radiolucency at the base. Short-term follow-up examinations showed progression of the disease in four patients, no change in one patient, and regression without specific therapy in one patient. Although these radiographic features are highly suggestive of cytomegalovirus esophagitis, the diagnosis requires histologic confirmation.\r"

Endoscopy may show single or multiple ulcers or a preulcerative phase consisting of mucosal thickening. Findings on barium enema may be normal or nonspecific, consisting of a thickened valve of Houston, nodularity, and rectal stricture. Pathologic changes consist of replacement of the lamina propria by fibroblasts and smooth muscle fibers with marked hypertrophy of the muscularis mucosae. In five patients with histologically proved solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, defecography was performed to evaluate the accompanying defecation disorder. Two patients showed the spastic pelvic floor syndrome, characterized by failure of relaxation of the pelvic floor musculature during straining. In the remaining three, defecography showed an infolding of the rectal wall toward the rectal lumen increasing gradually to form an intussusception. The results indicate that defecography is useful to show the underlying disorder of defecation in the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome.\r"

  ".W": "Between February 1981 and June 1984, 15 patients with benign biliary strictures were treated with percutaneous transhepatic balloon dilatation. Three of these patients had received liver transplants. The treatment began with a course of balloon dilatation therapy, after which a stent catheter was left across the stricture. Six weeks later, after duct patency had been shown by cholangiography, the stent catheter was removed from all but two patients, both of whom had intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis. After this procedure, six patients (40%), including two liver-transplant patients, were stricture-free after one treatment for periods ranging from 27 to 56 months, and were considered to be treatment successes. Nine patients (60%) suffered stricture recurrences. In eight of these patients, the stricture was heralded by symptoms of either cholangitis or jaundice; in one patient, who was on permanent catheter drainage, the stricture was discovered only on follow-up cholangiography. All successfully treated patients had only one stricture, while all patients with more than one stricture suffered recurrences. Our data also suggest a greater responsiveness for anastomotic strictures than for non-anastomotic strictures. Of the patients with recurrences, five had symptom-free intervals of 23 months or more (up to 31 months). The fact that strictures recurred after such long periods of time underscores the importance of long-term follow-up. In view of the number of patients helped, the favorable experience with post-liver-transplantation strictures, and the lack of any major complications in our series, percutaneous biliary balloon dilatation offers a viable alternative to surgical management of benign biliary strictures.\r"

  ".W": "In order to display temporomandibular joint (TMJ) images as a dynamic or motion study, a protocol was developed to obtain MR images of the TMJ in multiple phases of opening by using the \"fast-scanning\" capabilities of the GE Signa MR scanner. To facilitate this procedure a prototype device was also developed to passively open the patient's mouth from resting (closed) to fully open in user-defined increments (minimum 1 mm). MR imaging (surface coil) was carried out at each successive station using the GRASS, pulse-sequence data base of the GE Signa system operating at 1.5 T. Image-acquisition parameters were optimized in studies of cadavers and volunteers to obtain the clearest delineation of the TMJ meniscus and to determine any potential tradeoffs between total imaging time per slice (image quality), patient tolerance, and other practical considerations. For viewing, the images were sequentially placed in the video memory of the operating console and displayed in a back-and-forth-closed cine loop or \"movie\" mode at variable (operator-selectable) speeds. The dynamic sequences in four individuals were compared with static open- and closed-mouth views obtained with routine pulse sequences. Any single image from the dynamic display lacked the high resolution of the routine static images because of technical limitations of the pulse-sequence data base. However, in the movie mode the pertinent joint structures (such as meniscus and condyle) were clearly delineated, as were several of the important muscles of mastication. The anterior motion (translation) of the meniscus during jaw opening is particularly evident and suggests great potential for functional evaluation. These results show the feasibility of dynamic TMJ imaging with MR. The added information of the cine display potentially complements the routine static images and may prove extremely valuable in the assessment of TMJ dysfunction.\r"

In the first group (34 patients), the liquid agent was applied in the cranial part of the internal spermatic vein; in the second group (113 patients), the agent was applied in the caudal part of the vessel at the level of the inguinal ring. The success rate determined 3 months after therapy by telethermography was significantly higher after treatment in the caudal part (82%) than in the cranial part (68%) of the vessel. Sclerotherapy at the level of the inguinal ring appears to be superior to therapy in the cranial part of the internal spermatic vein.\r"

Eleven patients (group I) were shown by arteriography to have spasm in 2 or more large coronary arteries. Eight patients (group II) had spasm in only 1 coronary artery. In 7 patients in group I, significant diffuse perfusion defects simultaneously appeared in multiple coronary artery regions on the scintigram (group IA). The extent and severity of the perfusion defect as measured by thallium-201 tomography were significantly greater in group IA than in group II (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01, respectively). The duration of transient ST-segment elevation during the attack in group IA was significantly longer than in group II (p less than 0.001). The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, or complete atrioventricular block during the anginal attack was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in group IA than in group II. In all study patients, neither attack nor scintigraphic perfusion defect appeared on the repeat test after oral administration of nifedipine. In conclusion, multivessel coronary artery spasm simultaneously appears and causes the attack in many patients with variant angina and nearly normal coronary arteriographic findings, and myocardial ischemia due to simultaneous multivessel coronary spasm is likely to be more extensive and severe, persist longer and have a higher frequency of potentially dangerous arrhythmias than that due to spasm of only 1 coronary artery.\r"

  ".W": "Thromboendarterectomy is sometimes performed in association with coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). Right coronary arteries and severely narrowed coronary arteries mainly undergo thromboendarterectomy, but perioperative acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) are possible complications. One hundred seventy-six consecutive patients with rest and stress thallium-201 scintigraphy and angiography were studied before and after surgery. To compare patients with and without thromboendarterectomy, 48 patients who had undergone thromboendarterectomy and whose characteristics matched closely those of patients who had not were selected. Twenty patients had previous AMI before CABG in each group. Analysis accounted for the severity of vessel lesion (complete or incomplete) and for the patency of the graft and of the native coronary artery. In these 96 patients, graft patency was lower than in the overall group and similar among patients with and without thromboendarterectomy among the 56 patients without previous AMI. In patients with previous AMI and thromboendarterectomy, however, reperfusion was achieved more often through the native vessel than through the graft. New AMI or residual ischemia occurred in 32% of the areas undergoing thromboendarterectomy and in only 5% of the standard grafts (p less than 0.001). Best results were obtained in patients with incomplete occlusion after AMI. Patients without previous AMI had worse results. Thus, thromboendarterectomy can yield 64 to 75% good results in selected subgroups when CABG is otherwise impossible, but should be avoided in mildly or moderately stenotic arteries perfusing noninfarcted myocardium.\r"

Eight different drugs (indomethacin, ibuprofen, naproxen, sulindac, piroxicam, aspirin, salsalate, and tolmetin) had been taken continuously for at least 6 wk. Seven patients took two different NSAIDs. No other drug known to damage the mucosa was used. Twenty-one patients (32%) had an endoscopically completely normal stomach and duodenum, and 44 (68%) had evidence of injury (mucosal hemorrhage 44.6%, erosions 53.8%, both mucosal hemorrhage and erosions 34%). Ten patients had ulcers detected (seven gastric, two pyloric channel, one duodenal bulb) for a point prevalence of 15.4%. Ulcers were found in patients taking naproxen, indomethacin, tolmetin, sulindac, and ibuprofen, either alone, or in combination with aspirin. Dyspeptic symptoms were present in 19% of those with completely normal endoscopy and in only 9% of those with abnormal endoscopic findings. Only three of the 10 patients with ulcer had dyspeptic symptoms. There was no significant difference between drugs in tendency to cause gastroduodenal injury. We confirm that fairly severe gastroduodenal injury occurs in asymptomatic patients with rheumatoid and osteoarthritis, and that symptoms do not predict the presence of damage.\r"

Patients were followed for a mean of 90.1 +/- 28.8 months before dialysis and 20.8 +/- 4.7 months after the initiation of dialysis. Disease activity was quantified for each individual in terms of \"flares\" per year before and after the initiation of peritoneal dialysis, the means of which were 0.66 +/- 0.46 and 0.94 +/- 0.28, respectively. Comparison of these rates showed no statistical difference. Seven of the eight patients had at least one flare while receiving peritoneal dialysis, all of which required prednisone therapy (mean 31.3 mg per day). The clinical manifestations included fever, rash, myalgias, anemia, leukopenia, serositis, and cerebritis. Eighty-eight percent of these flares had associated worsening of serologic results. Prednisone was discontinued in only one patient at any time during peritoneal dialysis. This experience reveals that patients with lupus continue to show clinical and serologic disease activity and require maintenance prednisone therapy while receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis.\r"

The mean duration of follow-up for these patients was 19 months. Fifteen patients had a below-knee amputation, and nine had a toe amputation. The absence of necrosis and/or gangrene, the presence of swelling, and the use of antimicrobial therapy active against the isolated pathogens for at least four weeks intravenously, or combined intravenously and orally for 10 weeks, predicted a good outcome. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis, in the absence of extensive necrosis or gangrene, usually responds to antimicrobial therapy without the need for an ablative surgical procedure.\r"

These results suggest that reported differences among hospitals in hepatitis B seropositivity may in part be a reflection of the national origin of its employees.

Infiltrating lymphoid and tumor cells were characterized in frozen sections by the use of monoclonal antibodies and the avidin-biotin complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase technique. Five patients had objective tumor regression (1 complete response of a follicular lymphoma, 4 partial responses of melanomas). Four patients (2 melanomas, 1 renal cell carcinoma, 1 breast carcinoma) were nonresponsive after treatment. After treatment, responsive tumors showed a pronounced infiltration of T cells, mainly Leu-2+ (CD8, primarily cytotoxic/suppressor) cells. Macrophages, although increased, were fewer than the T cells, and Leu-7+ or Leu-11+ (NK and K) cells were virtually absent. In nonresponders, there was no significant increase in lymphoid cells after therapy, and no differences were noted between groups before therapy. In 4 of 5 responders, tumor cells were positive for HLA-DR before therapy; and in the remaining responder, the tumor became positive during treatment. Tumor cells in all biopsy specimens from nonresponders were DR- before and after the start of therapy. It is concluded that the expression of HLA-DR by tumor cells may play a role in the response to IL-2 with or without LAK and that marked infiltration by T cells accompanies, and possibly mediates, such a response.\r"

  ".W": "In a recent article, Miller has reminded us that medical malpractice litigation is not simply an economic problem which inhibits medical practice and increases health care costs. She argues that it has three broader \"societal objectives\": reparation, emotional vindication, and deterrence. Viewed in the broader perspective of social values, the Maine data suggest that our current approach to medical malpractice does not perform well. Significant numbers of respondents believe that they have been neither vindicated nor compensated for their own or their relatives' illness, injury, or death; and that they have not had the opportunity to protect others from harm. As Miller suggests in her review of British alternatives to medical malpractice litigation, there may be more efficient and effective means of reparation. There may also be more direct and less costly means to deter incompetent practitioners and vindicate those who are harmed. We shall never discover these alternatives if we view the medical malpractice \"crisis\" as a simple or straightforward problem of costs of premiums, costs of settlements, and costs of judgments; numerators. Medical malpractice litigation is the expression of deep and highly complicated problems, which cannot be solved or even significantly alleviated by false solutions motivated only by concerns of costs and cost containment. They can be addressed only by careful, thoughtful, and comprehensive analysis.\r"

The level of sedation was assessed hourly and measurements were made of haemodynamic, respiratory, haematological and biochemical variables. Sedation remained satisfactory in most patients throughout the study period, with only occasional alterations in infusion rate, and eight patients required further sedative therapy within 45 minutes of discontinuation of the propofol infusion. Arterial pressure tended to decrease from baseline values; mean and diastolic pressures demonstrated a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) at 4, 7 and 8 hours during the infusion. Adrenal steroidogenesis was not inhibited significantly. Propofol infusion proved to be a useful and readily controllable sedative agent, and discontinuation of the drug was followed by rapid recovery in most cases. The critically ill may be particularly sensitive to the cardiovascular depressant properties of the drug.\r"

  ".W": "Intraoperative two-dimensional echocardiography (2D-echo) is useful for monitoring global and regional left ventricular function. The 2D-echo view most frequently utilized during intraoperative monitoring is the short-axis view at the level of the papillary muscles. To determine whether hemodynamic data can be derived from this single 2D-echo short-axis view, 12 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were studied. All patients had normal left-ventricular function preoperatively (ejection fraction = 64% +/- 12%). Echo-data were obtained before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) by epicardial placement of a 5 MHz echo-transducer. The correlation between thermodilution and echo-derived cardiac indices was good (r = 0.8), and not significantly different from the correlation between stroke indices (r = 0.68). A strong positive correlation was established between end-diastolic volume index and echo cardiac index (CIE) (r = 0.93 before CPB; r = 0.91 after CPB) and end-diastolic area index and CIE (r = 0.94 before CPB; r = 0.91 after CPB). The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was not a determinant of cardiac index before or after cardiopulmonary bypass. No correlation was observed between systemic vascular resistance and echo-derived wall stress. These findings demonstrate that, in patients with good left-ventricular function undergoing CABG surgery, 2D-echo provides a better index of left-ventricular preload than conventional invasive hemodynamic monitoring.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of indomethacin on immunologic mediator release from human bronchial tissue (n = 6) and lung parenchyma (n = 7). Tissues were obtained from surgical specimens, minced, passively sensitized, and challenged with antigen E or anti-IgE in the presence or absence of indomethacin. At maximal levels of immunologic stimulation with either antigen or anti-IgE, the bronchial and parenchymal tissues released approximately 5 and 20% of total histamine (net), respectively, and approximately 3.5 and 45 ng/g of immunoreactive sulfidopeptide leukotriene, respectively. Analysis by high performance liquid chromatography followed by radioimmunoassay revealed that the airway supernatants contained LTD4 and LTE4, whereas the lung parenchymal samples contained predominantly LTE4. Little or no LTC4 was detected in either airway or parenchymal samples. Incubation with indomethacin (5 x 10(-6) M) resulted in approximately a 3-fold increase in antigen or anti-IgE-induced release of leukotrienes from the bronchial tissue. Indomethacin also enhanced antigen-induced histamine release approximately 2-fold but had no effect on anti-IgE-induced histamine release from this tissue. In contrast, indomethacin had no effect on antigen or anti-IgE-induced histamine or leukotriene release from the lung parenchymal tissue at any level of immunologic stimulation. These results support the hypothesis that indomethacin enhances human anaphylactic bronchospasm in vitro through an increase in mediator release from bronchial mast cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To assess determinants of prognosis for 43 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, objective clinical and histopathologic characteristics were analyzed for acute and long-term prognostic significance. Severe abnormalities on initial chest radiographs and alveolar-arterial oxygen differences (AaPO2) greater than 30 mm Hg were associated with higher mortality during the period of treatment for the acute episode (p less than 0.05). Decreased long-term survival after the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia correlated with the severity of interstitial edema (a component of diffuse alveolar damage) on initial transbronchial biopsy and elevation of AaPO2 at the time of diagnosis (Cox proportional hazards analysis, p less than 0.05). The persistence of Pneumocystis cysts after 3 wk of therapy was associated with significantly decreased long-term survival (p less than 0.05) when follow-up biopsy was performed in 27 of the patients. Patients with a diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia before July 1985 had more advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and a worse prognosis than did those in whom the diagnosis was made after July 1985 (p less than 0.05). This study demonstrates that important prognostic information can be derived from information obtained at initial presentation and follow-up bronchoscopic evaluation in patients with AIDS and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and suggests that early detection and initiation of therapy may improve chances for survival.\r"

Our clinical study involved inserting a needle electrode percutaneously into the region of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in five patients with spastic dysphonia. Electrical stimulation resulted in dramatic improvement in three patients and minimal improvement in two. Our experimental study was designed to create an animal model for an implantable nerve stimulator to be used on a long-term basis. A Medtronic spinal cord stimulation system was implanted into a dog, and a cuff electrode was positioned around the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Vocal cord position could be altered by varying the stimulus frequency. Long-term stimulation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve was relatively safe and effective. Eventually, we plan to implant nerve stimulators into spastic dysphonia patients who respond well to percutaneous stimulation.\r"

The MICs were less than 6.3 micrograms/ml and more than 12.5 micrograms/ml in the low- and high-resistance groups, respectively. All strains produced penicillin-binding protein 2' (PBP 2'), which has been associated with methicillin resistance and which has very low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Production of PBP 2' was regulated differently in low- and high-resistance strains. With penicillinase-producing strains of the low-resistance group, cefazolin, cefamandole, and cefmetazole induced PBP 2' production about 5-fold, while flomoxef induced production 2.4-fold or less. In contrast, penicillinase-negative variants of low-resistance strains produced PBP 2' constitutively in large amounts and induction did not occur. With high-resistance strains, flomoxef induced PBP 2' to an extent similar to that of cefazolin in both penicillinase-producing and -negative strains, except for one strain in which the induction did not occur. The amount of PBP 2' induced by beta-lactam antibiotics in penicillinase-producing strains of the low-resistance group correlated well with resistance to each antibiotic. Large amounts of PBP 2' in penicillinase-negative variants of the low-resistance group did not raise the MICs of beta-lactam compounds, although these strains were more resistant when challenged with flomoxef for 2 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Earlier studies indicated that both compounds showed potent anti-herpes simplex virus activity, with a 50% effective dose (ED50) of less than 0.25 microM. In the present study the cell growth inhibitory activity of FEAU (ED50, 200 to 2,060 microM) was found to be about 100-fold less than that of FMAU. With an ED50 ranging from 630 to 3,700 microM, FEAU only weakly inhibited thymidine incorporation into DNA, as compared with FMAU with an ED50 of 9 to 28 microM. Following exposure to [2-14C]FEAU (100 microM), 0.48 pmol/10(6) cells per h was incorporated into the DNA of herpes simplex virus type 1-infected Vero cells, whereas no detectable incorporation was found in uninfected Vero cells or L1210 cells. The Ki of FEAU for thymidine kinase purified from human leukemic cells was greater than 150 microM. For herpes simplex virus type 1- and 2-encoded thymidine kinases, the Kis were 0.6 and 0.74 microM, respectively. Both FEAU and FMAU were relatively nontoxic for mice, with a 50% lethal dose of greater than 800 mg/kg per day (four intraperitoneal doses). However, the lethal dose of FEAU for dogs was 100 mg/kg per day (10 intravenous doses), a dose which is 40- to 80-fold greater than the toxic dose of FMAU. These results suggest that FEAU is a worthy candidate for further development as an antiherpetic agent.\r"

At 5 micrograms/ml, carrageenan prevented the cell monolayer from destruction by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) growth. At 10 micrograms/ml, carrageenan reduced the formation of new infectious HSV-1 by almost five logs. No cytotoxic effects were detected with concentrations of carrageenan up to 200 micrograms/ml. When 10 micrograms of carrageenan per ml was added at the beginning of HSV-1 infection of HeLa cells, there was potent inhibition of viral protein synthesis, and the cells continued synthesizing cellular proteins. This did not occur if carrageenan was added 1 h after HSV-1 infection. The use of [35S]methionine-labeled virions to analyze the entry of HSV-1 or Semliki Forest virions into cells indicated that carrageenan had no effect on virus attachment or virus entry. Moreover, carrageenan did not block the early permeabilization of cells to the toxic protein alpha-sarcin. These results suggest that this sulfated polysaccharide inhibits a step in virus replication subsequent to viral internalization but prior to the onset of late viral protein synthesis.\r"

Outdoor sunlight exposure during the workshift and tanning salon use were identified as risk factors; the most severe cutaneous reactions tended to occur among tanning salon users. Although both stores carried the same brands and varieties of produce, all 19 cases occurred among employees of one store, which had held a celery sale coincident with the outbreak, resulting in a quadrupling of the usual volume of celery sold. We found elevated psoralen levels in two of three celery samples obtained from the affected store; cutaneous provocation tests with trimmed surfaces of these celery samples produced phototoxic reactions. Preliminary experiments with one brand of celery have demonstrated psoralen levels as high as 25 micrograms/cm2 of trimmed surface. These observations suggest that clinical phytophotodermatitis among grocery store workers may be caused by healthy celery and results from a complex interaction of exposure variables, including ultraviolet radiation from tanning salon use, frequency of handling celery, celery brand, and sporadic elevation of psoralen content from environmental stresses.\r"

Obvious features such as ataxia may indicate raised intracranial pressure in the posterior fossa. The child may, however, present with less specific signs of vomiting, anorexia, and lethargy and these symptoms may be misinterpreted as secondary to dilation of the lateral ventricular system due to malfunction of the ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. Two children with disproportionate enlargement of the fourth ventricle and two children with isolation of the fourth ventricle are described to illustrate the wide variations in clinical presentation. These rare complications can be diagnosed by real time ultrasound examination of the brain or computed tomography of the head. They should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a child who deteriorates after lateral ventriculo-peritoneal shunting for post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus, and dealt with specifically to avoid the risk of upward herniation of the enlarged fourth ventricle.\r"

Lymphocytes with surface antigens that bind T6, OKT9, and OKT10 are rarely found in the peripheral blood of adult patients, except in those with malignancies of the lymphoid system. In both burn and trauma patients the percentage of lymphocytes in the PBMC population after Ficoll-Hypaque separation was significantly reduced as compared with normal controls due to increases in the number of granulocytes, large granular lymphocytes (LGL), and monocytes, often present in immature forms. T6 cells were found in significantly greater numbers in both burn and nonthermal injury patients than in a control group using both small and wide gate settings on the fluorescence-activated flow cytometer. Significant increases in the number of T9+ cells also were observed in both groups for a prolonged period following injury. Significantly increased numbers of the T10+ and Ia1+ cells were detected in burn patients. The response to injury, therefore, involves the appearance in the peripheral blood of immature cells that may express T6, T9, T10, and Ia1 surface antigens. These cells may be present in quantities otherwise seen only in malignant disease.\r"

In 50% of the cases, colonoscopy detected a lesion other than diverticula. These lesions consisted of several forms of colitis, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), ulcers, and most importantly, neoplasms in 34% of the cases. In 13% of the cases, an invasive neoplasm was detected and 76% of them were early stage (Dukes A or B). A third of the neoplasms were located proximal to the splenic flexure. Among patients with a negative barium enema, 35% had a neoplasm detected on colonoscopy. These findings were similar for the three distinct patterns of rectal bleeding studied. These data support the need for colonoscopy in all types of rectal bleeders, regardless of the results obtained by BE.\r"

  ".W": "Although recent studies have shown that combined treatment with verapamil and ATP-MgCl2 (ATP) prevents cyclosporine (CyA)-induced nephrotoxicity, the mechanism of these effects remains unknown. To study this, rat kidneys were perfused at 100 mmHg for 100 minutes with Krebs buffer containing 7.5 g/dL of albumin and substrates. After an equilibration period of 30 minutes, 500 ng/mL CyA was added. In some experiments 1 microgram/mL verapamil was added 10 minutes prior to CyA and in others 2 mM ATP was added to CyA. At the end of the perfusion, cortical mitochondria (mito) were isolated and mito Ca2+ and Mg2+ (mumoles/g protein) and respiratory control ratios (RCR) were measured. In addition, total tissue Ca2+ and Mg2+ levels were measured. The results indicate that CyA treatment leads to an accumulation of mito Ca2+ and a decrease in ADP/O ratio. Simultaneous administration of ATP with CyA led to an increased mito Ca2+ accumulation and depressed RCR, which were corrected by verapamil pretreatment. The combination of verapamil pretreatment and ATP cotreatment with CyA increased tissue ATP levels from 0.8 +/- 0.4 (control) to 1.4 +/- 0.1 mumol/g. This pharmacologic regimen may prevent CyA-induced nephrotoxicity by preventing mito Ca2+ accumulation and by preserving mitochondrial respiratory function. This allows a more efficient generation of ATP and consequently preservation of renal function.\r"

There were 413 patients with medical therapy and 443 with early operation. Patients with delayed operation were kept in the medical group for analysis. Six-year survival adjusted for left ventricular (LV) function and number of proximal stenoses was 67% for medical and 84% for surgical patients (p less than 0.0001). Patients with normal LV function had equal survival with medicine or surgical intervention. Those with mild or moderate LV dysfunction (CASS LV wall motion score 6 to 9 and 10 to 15, respectively) and at least one proximal stenosis (the dominant right coronary artery) had increased probability of being alive at six years with surgical treatment. In patients with severe LV impairment (LV score higher than 15) and in those whose only proximal stenosis of 70% or more (in three-vessel disease) was located in the left anterior descending coronary artery, increased survival with surgical treatment could not be demonstrated. This is a nonrandomized observational study with the limitations of such studies: the need to adjust for differences in baseline traits between medical and surgical groups and the possibility of an unrecognized imbalance in baseline characteristics. In a Cox analysis of variables influencing outcome, early surgical treatment was an independent predictor of survival with 43% the risk of medical treatment (95% confidence range: 29 to 62%). Adjustment by propensity analysis to reduce selection bias from known differences in baseline variables did not alter results.\r"

The cases of 91 patients (age 38 to 80 years) with these disorders who were examined between 1955 and 1975 were reviewed to address this controversy. All patients underwent upper and lower gastrointestinal radiography, small bowel series, and proctoscopy. Other studies were endoscopy in 84 patients, colonoscopy in 61, and visceral angiography in 16. Of the 37 patients who underwent abdominal exploration, 35 (95%) continued to bleed postoperatively, including 8 of 10 patients who had bowel resection for angiodysplasia. Forty patients did not have an abdominal operation, and all have continued to bleed. Sixteen patients (2 of whom had had an abdominal procedure) underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. There were 2 intraoperative deaths among these 16 patients. At follow-up, which ranged from 8 to 12 years, only 1 patient who underwent aortic valve replacement had recurrent bleeding secondary to excessive anticoagulation. Thus, overall, gastrointestinal operation was successful in only 5% of patients, but aortic valve replacement was effective in 93%. For unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding associated with aortic stenosis, aortic valve replacement should be considered because of the likelihood of cure.\r"

In 20 consecutively treated patients, fibrin glue was sprayed on the anterior mediastinum before closure of the median sternotomy incision. A control group of 20 patients undergoing the identical cardiac operations (13 coronary artery bypass grafting procedures [CABG], 4 valve replacements [including 1 reoperative procedure], and 3 combined valve replacements and CABG) by the same surgeon within a one-year period was chosen for comparison of chest tube outputs. Specifically, chest tube outputs were as follows for treated and untreated patients, respectively: at 12 hours, 461 +/- 40 ml (mean +/- 1 standard error of the mean versus 731 +/- 80 ml; at 24 hours, 714 +/- 73 ml versus 1,016 +/- 109 ml; and at 48 hours, 863 +/- 93 ml versus 1,187 +/- 137 ml. The differences between control and spray chest tube output are statistically significant by unpaired t test (p less than 0.05) at both 12 and 24 hours. Thus, this method can reduce perioperative hemorrhage from the anterior mediastinum after cardiac operations.\r"

Bepridil increased the AH interval and the functional refractory period of the atrioventricular node. The effective refractory periods of the right atrium and right ventricle were also increased. Bepridil prolonged refractoriness in the accessory pathway both in the anterograde and retrograde direction. After bepridil administration it was impossible to induce reciprocating tachycardia electrically in two patients because of conduction block in the normal pathway. On the other hand, the zone of tachycardia was often increased after bepridil. Nevertheless, the heart rate during tachycardia was slowed by depression of conduction in both the normal and accessory pathways. The findings of this study provide a basis for the antiarrhythmic action of bepridil in patients with atrioventricular accessory pathways.\r"

All patients initially received bepridil for three weeks (200-600 mg/day), followed by amiodarone for two to three months (100-400 mg/day). Bepridil seemed to be slightly more effective than amiodarone in converting the fibrillation to sinus rhythm (nine of fourteen compared with four of ten). The ventricular response in atrial fibrillation was equally well controlled by bepridil and amiodarone, both at rest and during exercise. Bepridil was associated with the development of ventricular arrhythmias in eight of fourteen patients; two had torsade de pointes, which in one degenerated into fatal ventricular fibrillation. These arrhythmias seemed to be associated with bepridil induced prolongation of the QTc interval. No ventricular arrhythmias were seen during amiodarone treatment. Although bepridil seems to be an effective antiarrhythmic agent for the management of atrial fibrillation, its arrhythmogenic actions make it unsuitable for this purpose.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial imaging with gallium-67 citrate was used to detect myocarditis in 46 consecutive infants and children (31 boys and 15 girls, mean age 21 months) with Kawasaki disease. In all of them planar imaging (group A) was performed at 6 hours and at 48 or 72 hours after the intravenous administration of a mean (SD) dose of gallium-67 citrate (0.07 (0.02) mCi/kg). Thirty four patients (24 boys and 10 girls, mean age 21 months) also had single photon emission computed tomography imaging (group B) soon after planar imaging. The patients had been ill for from 5 days to 16 days (mean (SD) 10.5 (2.4) days in group A and 10.6 (3.0) days in group B). The colour images obtained at 48 or 72 hours were positive in 41% of group A and in 64% of group B. Among the patients with clinically suspected myocarditis, 63% in group A and 80% in group B had positive myocardial images. Single photon emission computed tomography imaging permitted the identification of tracer in the myocardium, the pericardium only, or in the heart chambers. Myocardial imaging with gallium-67 citrate, especially when used with single photon emission computed tomography imaging, is useful for the detection of myocarditis in the acute phase of Kawasaki disease.\r"

The typical greyish branching plaques are usually accompanied by a limbitis, stromal keratitis, or decrease in corneal sensation and are commonly associated with cataract, raised intraocular pressure, or corneal ulceration. MPK may begin at any time within two years of onset of the rash, but when it appears after three months there are more complications. Usually MPK settles within one month if appropriate treatment with topical steroids and acetylcysteine drops is given, but surgical intervention is sometimes required to control glaucoma or neuroparalytic keratitis or to remove cataracts. The results of surgery are surprisingly good.\r"

Circulating CFU-GM are known to differ from marrow CFU-GM in many characteristics, and in the present study, we compared the effect of PGE1 on circulating and bone marrow progenitors in normals and in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). PGE1 caused a dose-dependent inhibition of normal marrow CFU-GM. Circulating CFU-GM were inhibited only at concentrations of 10(-5) mol/L or greater, and progenitor proliferation was, in fact, significantly stimulated at PGE1 concentrations between 10(-8) and 10(-6) mol/L. Bone marrow CFU-GM from patients with CML were inhibited in a manner similar to that of normal bone marrow. Circulating cells from patients with CML were, however, less sensitive to PGE1 inhibition than CML bone marrow cells and demonstrated a pattern intermediate between normal circulating and normal marrow progenitors. These studies suggest that peripheral blood and bone marrow contain different progenitor cell populations.\r"

The size of these deletions has previously eluded exact definition. Using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and the enzyme SfiI, which cuts only rarely in genomic DNA, we have constructed a large-scale restriction map of the beta-globin cluster in normal and HPFH DNA. The deletions in HPFH-1, which occurs in American blacks, and in HPFH-2, which occurs in Ghanaian blacks, are found to be approximately 105 kilobases (kb) in length, though the endpoints are staggered by approximately 5 kb. The fact that two previously reported gamma delta beta-thalassemia deletions to the 5' side of the beta-globin cluster are also about 100 kb suggests a common mechanism, possibly involving the loss of a complete chromatin loop.\r"

This rearrangement interrupts the Bcl-2 gene and introduces it into the Ig locus at 14q32. The rearrangement between the joining region (JH) of Ig on chromosome 14 and the 18q21 region creates a translocation-specific DNA rearrangement. We generated probes that distinguish the 14;18 juncture on the derivative (der) 14 and der (18) chromosomes, providing a molecular approach to t(14;18) identification. Approximately 60% of unselected follicular lymphomas, 20% of diffuse large cell lymphomas, and 50% of adult undifferentiated non-Burkitt lymphomas demonstrated 14;18 rearrangements within the major breakpoint region. Examination of DNA for 14;18 rearrangements resolved the identity of 14q+ chromosomes in two patient's cells that lacked an obvious reciprocal partner. Identification of the exact restriction fragments that mediate translocations complements routine cytogenetics. The detection of DNA rearrangements does not require dividing cells or the presence of an identifiable reciprocal partner and can detect clonal translocation rearrangements when the neoplastic cells are only a minority of all cells present.\r"

Protein bands characteristic of delta glycophorin (glycophorin B) were absent from the immunoblots of whole erythrocyte lysates when probed with polyclonal glycophorin antisera and from isolated erythrocyte membranes stained with PAS reagents. Genomic DNA from the two individuals' leukocytes was digested with a panel of restriction enzymes and probed with alpha M glycophorin cDNA obtained from human K562 leukemic cell line. The EcoRI, PstI, and KpnI restriction site patterns were identical to those of S+s+U+ controls in fragment numbers and relative size but differed from controls in band intensities. Restriction mapping with HindIII, PvuII, SacI, MspI, and BamHI revealed that S-s-U- individuals lack fragments that are reproducibly observed in S+s+U+ controls, and most likely encode delta glycophorin. Using truncated 5' and 3' cDNA segments as probes and comparing, in control individuals, hybridization intensities of fragments with amino acid sequence homologies, we have inferred the assignment of restriction fragments to the alpha and delta glycophorin genes. Our results suggest that the absence of delta glycophorin in the two S-s-U- individuals is a result of deletion of the entire delta glycophorin gene. This is the first report of a glycophorin gene deletion.\r"

Abnormalities involving chromosomes other than 9 and 12 were noted in four of the eight patients. All cells with the tdic(9;12) expressed both the common ALL antigen and HLA-DR. Cytoplasmic immunoglobulin, a marker of pre-B ALL, was detected in one case with the tdic(9;12) but was absent in the other seven. Our results suggest that the tdic(9;12)(p1?1;p1?2) rearrangement is specifically associated with leukemic B cell precursors.\r"

These results suggest that major cortical derangement is the crucial factor for the appearance of aphasia or neglect after a subcortical stroke. These remote effects, which are related to the size of the subcortical lesion, are interpreted in terms of interruption of neural connections (diaschisis).\r"

Particular attention was paid to cells at the plaque edge and to normal appearing white matter adjacent to plaques. Numbers of both the C-S and the H-I subset peaked directly at the edges of plaques, whether histopathologically active or inactive (P less than 0.01). Normal appearing areas outside active plaques had fewer C-S cells than equivalent areas outside inactive plaques (P less than 0.05). A study of three whole plaques showed that the sum of the two T cell subsets was significantly greater than the number of cells bearing the pan-T cell marker in two plaques and in two border regions. The present results support a crucial role for the balance of T cell subsets in the evolution of plaque margins. When taken together with similar findings in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, they suggest that helper-inducer cell dominance at the border is necessary for plaque expansion while C-S dominance in non plaque areas is associated with controlled disease. In addition, they suggest either modulation of the OKT3 surface antigen or the presence of a non-T cell bearing OKT8 in association with the site of histopathological change.\r"

Patients were considered eligible for this study if refractory to or relapsed from combination chemotherapy, had a life expectancy of 4 weeks or more, a performance status greater than or equal to 50%, normal renal and hepatic function, and no chemotherapy within 4 weeks. Clinical characteristics of the patients in this study included lymphadenopathy in five patients, skin involvement in four patients, bone marrow infiltration in five patients, and central nervous system involvement in two patients. Circulating ATL cells were present in four patients, and three were hypercalcemic. Of five patients evaluable for response, there was one PR of 1 month, and two minor responses lasting 2 and 3 weeks. The median duration of survival for all treated patients was 3 weeks or more. The DCF was associated with moderate side effects, including conjunctivitis in three patients, nausea and vomiting in two patients, progressive hepatic insufficiency in one patient, and moderate myelotoxicity in three patients. Infections occurred in four patients, including two cases of oral candidiasis and two cases of fatal neutropenic sepsis in patients receiving concurrent intrathecal methotrexate. As a single agent, DCF appears to have limited activity in advanced refractory/relapsed ATL. Studies in the future should explore DCF in combination with other cytotoxic agents as initial therapy in better-risk patients.\r"

  ".W": "A 6-year-old Jewish Iranian girl with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHLH) is described. The course of the disease fluctuated with partial initial response to antibiotics, steroids, and supportive treatment. Subsequent cytotoxic treatment, including VP-16, Velban (vinblastine sulfate), and methotrexate (MTX) controlled the disease for a few months but the child died with a clinical picture of meningocephalitis 1.5 years later. Benign-looking lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with varying degrees of hemophagocytosis were present in the bone marrow, pleural effusion, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), liver, and brain. Clinical and laboratory evidence of immunologic dysregulation during the disease could be demonstrated. Frequent and intense viral and bacterial infectious diseases were encountered. The laboratory examination most consistently found was the absence of natural killer (NK) cell activity against K562 target cells. The impaired activity of NK cells persisted during all stages of the disease including remission, although NK cell numbers, determined morphologically and immunophenotypically (by Leu-11, Leu-7), were normal. Natural killer activity could not be restored by interferon. Moreover, the interferon system appeared to be intact. Impaired monokin interleukin 1 (IL-I) production by peripheral blood monocytes was found and could not be restored by indomethacin. Lymphopenia, a mild decrease in T4 numbers, and subsequently, decreased proliferative response to mitogens was noted. Elevated immunoglobulin levels were found during exacerbations and viral episodes, at times accompanied by the presence of auto-antibodies. The exaggerated fatal lymphohistiocytic response typical for FHLH could be attributed to a underlying genetic pathologic dysregulation of the various immunological response pathways.\r"

Both the immunostaining features of the Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells and their variants, and the numbers of immunostained accompanying cells morphologically corresponding to macrophage-histiocytes (M-H) and to interdigitating reticulum cells (IRC) were analyzed. Variable numbers of R-S cells and their variants were positive for Leu-M1 in 83% of the cases, for alpha 1-antitrypsin in 40%, for alpha 1-antichymotrypsin in 30%, and for leukocyte common antigen in 3.4%; they were constantly negative for lysozyme and S-100 protein. Whereas the average numbers of accompanying cells immunostained for Leu-M1 were very low, the numbers of S-100-positive IRC were relatively high in all the Hodgkin's subtypes. The average numbers of M-H were lower (P less than 0.1 for lysozyme; P less than 0.001 for alpha 1-antichymotrypsin) in the nodular sclerosis than in the other pooled subtypes. In the nodular sclerosis subtype, however, R-S cells and their variants that stained positive for Leu-M1 appeared to express more frequently the lineage markers of M-H (alpha 1-antitrypsin and/or alpha 1-antichymotrypsin). These data appear to suggest that there is not an apparent qualitative correspondence between the immunostaining features of the cellular microenvironment composed of M-H and IRC and the features of the R-S cells.\r"

Using positron emission tomography (PET) we measured the rate of uptake of the glucose analogue 18fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) in 12 patients with carcinoma of the lung. The tumor types were six squamous cell, two large cell, two oat cell, one adenocarcinoma, and one undifferentiated carcinoma. In each patient a transaxial plane was selected that contained the bulk of the tumor tissue. Regional density and blood volume were measured. Following the intravenous injection of 18FDG, the rates of uptake in the tumor and normal lung tissue were assessed from sequential scans over 1 hour. In each patient the rate of uptake of 18FDG in the tumor tissue was significantly increased relative to normal lung tissue. For the group the rate of uptake by the tumor was 211.4 +/- 69.4 ml/100 g/hr (mean +/- SD) compared to 31.9 +/- 13.2 in the contralateral lung (P less than 0.05). The tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 6.6 (range, 2.7 to 14.6) was higher than previously reported ratios for brain and liver tumors. In contrast to brain tumors there was little correlation between tumor type and rate of 18FDG uptake. Measurements of glucose metabolism taken in vivo in human pulmonary tumors may lead to advances in screening, staging, and therapy.\r"

After NK cells were incubated for 5 days with IL-2, NK cells from 82% (36/44) of patients showed enhanced cytotoxicity toward K562 and several acute leukemia cell lines as well as toward autologous leukemic cells. Cytotoxicity toward autologous cells was very low (0% to 5%, 16 hour assay) before IL-2 stimulation, and significantly increased (23% to 69%) after stimulation, suggesting that IL-2 may be a useful agent for enhancing the antileukemic immune response.\r"

When the appropriate tests have been performed, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen (EBNA) or EBV DNA has been found in tissues from these tumors. These data have provided support for the idea that these tumors are associated with EBV. In this article we report about a child with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) who developed a malignant B-cell lymphoma that was not associated with EBV. The B-cell lymphoma in the patient proved to be, by hybridization analysis of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene rearrangements of tumor-cell DNA, of clonal origin. However, neither EBNA nor EBV DNA could be detected in tumor tissue by anticomplement immunofluorescence or in situ cytohybridization with an EBV DNA probe. Furthermore, EBV DNA could not be detected by Southern blot hybridization using two EBV DNA hybridization probes on the same DNA blots that clearly contained the clonal Ig gene rearrangement. This case represents a clonal B-cell lymphoma occurring in a severely immunodeficient patient that was not associated with EBV. Antiviral chemoprophylaxis has been recommended for the prevention of EBV-related B-cell lymphoproliferations in transplant patients. Such prophylaxis may be ineffective in patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders not associated with EBV.\r"

  ".W": "In an effort to delineate the distribution of the Leu-7 antigen in small cell neoplasms, 283 paraffin-embedded examples of such tumors were studied immunohistochemically. These included 125 malignant lymphomas, 94 neuroendocrine carcinomas, 13 adenocarcinomas, 14 squamous carcinomas, four malignant melanomas, six neuroblastomas, four nephroblastomas (Wilms' tumors), six primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, three \"Askin\" tumors, ten Ewing's sarcomas, and four embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. Histologic diagnoses were verified by the use of electron microscopic study or independent immunostains. Overall, 44% of small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas expressed Leu-7, whereas nonendocrine carcinomas were uniformly nonreactive for this determinant. All neuroblastomas yielded immunopositivity, as did three primitive neuroectodermal tumors, three rhabdomyosarcomas, two \"Askin\" tumors, one nephroblastoma, one Ewing's sarcoma, and one malignant melanoma. None of the small cell lymphomas were Leu-7 positive. These results suggest that Leu-7 is a specific neuroendocrine marker in cases of small cell carcinoma, but its sensitivity is lower than that of other \"endocrine\" determinants. Reactivity patterns for Leu-7 in other small cell tumors demonstrate no specificity for any given line of cellular differentiation. However, the shared expression of this antigen by neuroblastomas, neuroectodermal tumors, Ewing's sarcomas, and Wilm's tumors contributes further to the hypothesis that these neoplasms may be related histogenetically.\r"

The study yielded the following results: (1) tumor-infiltrating lymphoreticular cells preferentially accumulated in the stromal bands; the tumor foci generally showed a considerably lower degree of infiltration; (2) in most cases, monocytes/macrophages (Mono 1+) represented the overwhelming majority of tumor-infiltrating cells; (3) next in frequency were T-lymphocytes (Leu-1+), especially CD4+ lymphocytes (Leu-3a+), while CD8+ lymphocytes (Leu-2a+) mostly occurred only in moderate numbers; (4) B-lymphocytes (To15+), plasma cells, natural killer cells (Leu-7+), tissue mast cells, and T-accessory reticulum cells (OKT 6+) were observed mostly in low or very low numbers, while eosinophils were nearly absent and B-accessory reticulum cells (Ki-M4+) were totally absent from the lymphoreticular infiltrates. Definite conclusions regarding the functional properties of the tumor-infiltrating cells cannot be drawn from an immunohistologic analysis in situ alone, but the preferred localization of most tumor-infiltrating cells in the stroma does not support an intensive interaction between the host defenses and the metastatic tumor.\r"

  ".U": "88053226\r", 
  ".W": "The objective of this study was to elucidate the close similarity in properties between endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and nitric oxide radical (NO). Whenever possible, a comparison was also made between arterial and venous EDRF. In vascular relaxation experiments, acetylcholine and bradykinin were used as endothelium-dependent relaxants of isolated rings of bovine intrapulmonary artery and vein, respectively, and NO was used to relax endothelium-denuded rings. Oxyhemoglobin produced virtually identical concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on both endothelium-dependent and NO-elicited relaxation. Oxyhemoglobin and oxymyoglobin lowered cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, increased tone in unrubbed artery and vein, and abolished the marked accumulation of vascular cGMP caused both by endothelium-dependent relaxants and by NO. The marked inhibitory effects of oxyhemoglobin on arterial and venous relaxant responses and cGMP accumulation as well as its contractile effects were abolished or reversed by carbon monoxide. These observations indicate that EDRF and NO possess identical properties in their interactions with oxyhemoproteins. Both EDRF from artery and vein and NO activated purified soluble guanylate cyclase by heme-dependent mechanisms, thereby revealing an additional similarity in heme interactions. Spectrophotometric analysis disclosed that the characteristic shift in the Soret peak for hemoglobin produced by NO was also produced by an endothelium-derived factor released from washed aortic endothelial cells by acetylcholine or A23187. Pyrogallol, via the action of superoxide anion, markedly inhibited the spectral shifts, relaxant effects, and cGMP accumulating actions produced by both EDRF and NO. Superoxide dismutase enhanced the relaxant and cGMP accumulating effects of both EDRF and NO. Thus, EDRF and NO are inactivated by superoxide in a closely similar manner. We conclude, therefore, that EDRF from artery and vein is either NO or a chemically related radical species.\r"

  ".W": "Myocardial ischemia may play a critical role in the symptomatic presentation and natural history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To assess the relative prevalence and functional significance of myocardial perfusion abnormalities in patients comprising the broad clinical spectrum of HCM, we studied 72 patients (ages 12 to 69 years, mean 40) using thallium-201 emission computed tomography. Imaging was performed immediately after maximal exercise and again after a 3 hr delay. Regional perfusion defects were identified in 41 of the 72 patients (57%). Fixed or only partially reversible defects were evident in 17 patients, 14 of whom (82%) had left ventricular ejection fractions of less than 50% at rest. Twenty-four patients demonstrated perfusion defects during exercise that completely reversed at rest; all had normal or hyperdynamic left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction greater than or equal to 50%). Perfusion abnormalities were present in all regions of the left ventricle. However, the fixed defects were observed predominantly in segments of the left ventricular wall that were of normal or only mildly increased (15 to 20 mm) thickness; in contrast, a substantial proportion (41%) of the completely reversible defects occurred in areas of moderate-to-marked wall thickness (greater than or equal to 20 mm, p less than .001). Neither a history of chest pain nor its provocation with treadmill exercise was predictive of an abnormal thallium study, since regional perfusion defects were present in 10 of 18 (56%) completely asymptomatic patients, compared with 31 of 54 (58%) symptomatic patients. These data indicate that myocardial perfusion abnormalities occur commonly among patients with HCM. Fixed or only partially reversible defects suggestive of myocardial scar and/or severe ischemia occur primarily in patients with impaired systolic performance. Completely reversible perfusion abnormalities occur predominantly in patients with normal or supranormal left ventricular systolic function. Such dynamic changes in regional thallium activity may reflect an ischemic process that contributes importantly to the clinical manifestations and natural history of HCM.\r"

After one hour, the corresponding increases were 4.2 ml/kg (group P), 8.2 ml/kg (group D), and 6.2 ml/kg (group G). The increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and stroke index were greatest and most persistent in group D, second largest but shortest in duration in group G, and lowest in group P. In conclusion, the volume effects of these three colloid solutions in coronary bypass patients are comparable to those obtained in other elective surgical patients.\r"

  ".W": "We initiated this study to determine the cellular composition and T-lymphocyte subpopulations of fluid from bronchoalveolar lavage from 15 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (1SS), six patients with secondary Sjogren's syndrome associated with primary biliary cirrhosis (2SS-PBC), eight patients with secondary Sjogren's syndrome associated with collagen-vascular diseases (2SS-CVD), and 12 normal subjects. All were nonsmokers who were free of clinical pulmonary symptoms and had normal findings on chest roentgenograms. Lymphocyte subsets were identified by mouse monoclonal antibodies that were specific for T-cells, helper/inducer, and suppressor/cytotoxic (namely, OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8). Patients with 1SS, patients with 2SS-PBC, and patients with 2SS-CVD had a significantly increased percentage of lymphocytes in fluid from bronchoalveolar lavage (respectively, 21.6 +/- 3.7 percent, 24.3 +/- 6.1 percent, and 25.6 +/- 3.9 percent) compared with the normal value of control subjects (9.9 +/- 1.5 percent). In addition, two of the 15 patients with 1SS and five of the eight patients with 2SS-CVD demonstrated an increased percentage of alveolar neutrophils. The predominant T-cell subset in patients with 1SS was T4+, and the mean T4:T8 ratio was normal. The percentage of T4+ cells was increased in patients with 2 SS-PBC, resulting in an increased T4:T8 ratio. In contrast, patients with 2 SS-CVD demonstrated a markedly increased percentage of T8+ cells, reflected by a shift in the T4:T8 ratio which was inverted. Patients with Sjogren's syndrome and with neutrophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage had a marked expansion of the T8+ lymphocyte subpopulation, where as patients with Sjogren's syndrome and with pure lymphocytosis on bronchoalveolar lavage showed predominantly T4+ cells. In addition, we found a strong positive correlation between the number of neutrophils and the number of T8+ cells in bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with Sjogren's syndrome (r = 0.74; p less than 0.05). Until the functional activities of OKT4+ and OKT8+ cells are better defined, the role that these cells play in the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease in Sjogren's syndrome remains unclear.\r"

  ".W": "The role of vasopressin (VP) in the regulation of pituitary corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors was studied by examining the effects of adrenalectomy and VP infusion on pituitary CRF receptors in genetically VP-deficient rats (di/di) and Long-Evans control rats. Binding studies with [125I]Tyr-ovine CRF in 30,000 X g anterior pituitary membrane-rich fractions revealed similar characteristics for the CRF receptors in Long-Evans and di/di rats, with Kd values of 2.4 +/- 0.6 and 1.9 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively, and receptor concentrations of 278 +/- 31 and 286 +/- 43 fmol/mg, respectively. Two days after adrenalectomy, the pituitary CRF receptor concentration decreased by 72 +/- 4.2% in Long-Evans rats, but by only 20.3 +/- 5.6% in di/di rats. CRF receptor affinity was unchanged after adrenalectomy (Kd = 1.7 +/- 0.5 nM; n = 8). To determine whether VP deficiency is responsible for the smaller decrease in CRF receptor in di/di rats, the effect of exogenous VP infusion (100 ng/min) by sc osmotic minipumps was studied in adrenalectomized di/di rats. Two days after adrenalectomy, pituitary CRF receptors were reduced by 21 +/- 8% in control di/di rats, whereas a 77.7 +/- 1.8% decrease was observed in VP-infused di/di rats, comparable to the effect of adrenalectomy in Long-Evans rats. VP infusion also caused a significant 35 +/- 2% decrease in CRF receptors in the pituitaries of sham-operated di/di rats, with no change in CRF receptor affinity. In Sprague-Dawley rats, VP or CRF infusion (100 ng/min) decreased pituitary CRF receptors by 14 +/- 1.9% and 46 +/- 3%, respectively. However, the combined infusion of both peptides caused a 65% +/- 4.2 decrease, similar to that observed after adrenalectomy. In vitro incubation of quartered pituitaries with VP or CRF for 4 h reduced CRF receptors by 23.1 +/- 8.2% and 38.2 +/- 3.8%, respectively, while simultaneous preincubation with both peptides was followed by a decrease of 55.3 +/- 5.3%. These findings indicate that increased hypothalamic release of VP contributes to the down-regulation of pituitary CRF receptors after adrenalectomy.\r"

This pattern of disease resistance and susceptibility can be reversed if females are treated with testosterone and males are treated with estrogen before virus infection. As a possible explanation for this sex difference in disease development, differences in early antiviral host responses were explored. Cellular antiviral resistance mechanisms operative early in virus infection were evaluated in ICR Swiss mice of both sexes after intraperitoneal infection with virus. No differences were seen in splenic natural killer (NK) cell responses of male and female mice during the 1st wk of infection, during which only the males became diabetic. Depletion of NK cell activity with rabbit anti-asialo GM1 serum did not render the infected ICR Swiss female susceptible to virus-induced diabetes. Treatment of ICR Swiss mice with type I carrageenan to compromise macrophage function rendered the female susceptible to diabetes after infection with EMCV-D but made only the male susceptible to diabetes by the usually avirulent interferon-inducing EMCV-D. Concanavalin A and recombinant interleukin 2, inducers of immune interferon, which in turn primes macrophages for activation and induces their expression of la antigens, protected the ICR Swiss male against the diabetogenic effects of EMCV-D. Interleukin 2 enhanced the male's capacity to exhibit an increase in the expression of Ia antigen by peritoneal exudate cells 1 day after injection with EMCU-D to a level seen in disease-resistant females.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The prevalence of low birth weight and no prenatal care were lower for each race/education group than those observed in comparable national data. Mortality rates were higher in the poorer areas for each sex, race, age group, and disease category. The excess mortality in the poorer areas declined significantly over the period studied for conditions amenable to medical care but not for conditions not amenable. In minorities, however, the excess mortality increased significantly for amenable conditions with no change for nonamenable conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the socially disadvantaged suffer an excess burden of morbidity and mortality. Access to medical care may make a significant contribution to reducing these inequities, but major barriers to equitable health and health care remain, particularly for minorities. This is an important but neglected area of concern for family medicine, and the implications are discussed.\r"

Chronic neuropathy and postfracture recovery are the leading indications for using the portable stimulative device, although it has also been applied successfully in relieving low-back pain, postherpetic neuralgia, myofascial pain, phantom-limb pain, and advanced, painful malignancies. However, TENS is rarely used alone in pain relief, but instead should be part of a larger management program that may include other modalities.\r"

In untreated patients groups, the pressure gradient rose by 6-12 mmHg during Valsalva's manoeuvre in four patients, fell by 4-11 mmHg in five patients and was virtually unchanged in the remainder. These changes seem unlikely to cause variceal bleeding. Patients who repeated Valsalva's manoeuvre showed similar changes on each occasion. Six patients in the untreated group also received hyoscinbutylbromide 20 mg iv. No change was seen in the pressure gradient in five patients, suggesting that it is of little value in preventing variceal bleeding.\r"

In addition to determining circulating autoantibody status, 10 patients, 51 first-degree relatives and 6 spouses of index chronic active hepatitis patients, each ascertained by the single patient, were genotyped for HLA (A, B and DR loci) and immunoglobulin allotype (G1m, G2m, G3m and A2m loci) haplotypes. Among the 10 chronic active hepatitis patients, 6 had HLA haplotypes B8 and DR3, and 3 of these patients had, in addition, the immunoglobulin allotype haplotype Gm a,x;g. Circulating autoantibodies defining the surrogate phenotype was found in 39% of the first-degree relatives. However, segregation analysis offered no support for either single autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance for the autoantibody-positive phenotype. Linkage between the postulated disease susceptibility locus and either the HLA (Chromosome 6) or immunoglobulin (Chromosome 14) locus was excluded by several analyses. Furthermore, logistic regression indicated that neither immunogenetic marker was statistically associated with autoantibody positively in these families. Therefore, despite the occurrence of autoantibody positivity in first-degree relatives of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis patients, we found no evidence that this trait has a simple genetic basis, or that it is an alternative manifestation of a postulated disease susceptibility gene for chronic active hepatitis.\r"

  ".W": "A model of angiotensin II action has been developed in which the flow of information from cell surface to cell interior proceeds by two temporally distinct branches: a calmodulin branch largely responsible for initiating the response; and a C-kinase branch for sustaining it. There are at least two initial events: a prompt and sustained increase in calcium influx rate, and prompt hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The latter leads to the generation of water-soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and lipid soluble diacylglycerol. The rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration causes the redistribution of intracellular calcium, a transient rise in the calcium concentration in the cytosol, and the activation of calmodulin-dependent enzymes, including protein kinase(s). As a result, several cellular proteins are rapidly phosphorylated and initiate the cellular response. The rise in calcium and these initial phosphorylation events are transient, however, so that an additional mechanism is necessary to sustain the response. The rise in diacylglycerol content, along with the transient rise in cytosolic calcium, leads to a shift of the C-kinase from a calcium-insensitive to a calcium-sensitive, plasma membrane-associated form. In this location, the activity of C-kinase is regulated by the rate of calcium flux across the plasma membrane. As a result of the activity of the C-kinase, a second set of cellular proteins becomes phosphorylated, and these control the sustained phase of the response.\r"

The activation of sodium-hydrogen exchange by mitogens is associated with changes in intracellular pH that appear to be permissive but not causal in allowing cells to proceed through the cell cycle. When added to cells, mitogens also activate protein kinase C, which acts as part of a feedback loop to control the activity of the mitogen receptor. Possible mechanisms for this control are discussed.\r"

To determine factors controlling this process, the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on trophoblast differentiation were studied using long term serum-free culture of isolated trophoblast. Only trophoblast was present in the cultures, as demonstrated by positive immunoperoxidase staining with beta hCG, cytokeratin, and trophoblast-specific H315 monoclonal antisera and by the absence of contaminating endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages, as shown by negative staining with vimentin and OKM1 monoclonal antisera. EGF induced large sustained increases in hCG and human placental lactogen (hPL) secretion in a dose-dependent manner. The minimum effective dose was 0.1 ng/mL, and the maximum effective dose was 1 ng/mL. Light and electron microscopic studies showed EGF-induced differentiation of cytotrophoblast to form syncytiotrophoblast. DNA content and cell number did not change during the process. The formation of syncytia thus probably accounted for the increase in hCG and hPL secretion. We conclude that EGF causes morphological differentiation, but not cell proliferation, of trophoblasts, and the differentiation results in increased hCG and hPL secretion from the syncytia.\r"

Bone loss was approximately 1% per yr among late perimenopausal and postmenopausal groups, whereas the early perimenopausal group lost no bone. Mean serum estrogen and BGP concentrations predicted rates of bone loss. BGP was negatively correlated with the rate of bone loss (r = -0.45) and with mean estrogen concentrations (r = -0.40). Multivariate regressions showed estrogen concentrations to be strong independent predictors of the slope of bone mass over time. When BGP concentrations were added to the models, the significance of estrogen was reduced, suggesting that a portion of the estrogen effect was mediated through effects on rates of bone remodelling.\r"

  ".W": "Current concepts relating to the pathogenesis of emphysema associated with cigarette smoking is that an imbalance exists within the lower respiratory tract between neutrophil elastase and the local anti-neutrophil elastase screen, enabling uninhibited neutrophil elastase to destroy the alveolar structures over time. The possible role of alveolar macrophages in contributing to this imbalance was investigated by evaluating the ability of cigarette smokers' alveolar macrophages to inactivate alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT), the major anti-neutrophil elastase of the human lower respiratory tract. In vitro, alveolar macrophages of smokers spontaneously released 2.5-fold more superoxide anion and eightfold more H2O2 than macrophages of nonsmokers (P less than 0.01, both comparisons). Using a model system that reproduced the relative amounts of alveolar macrophages and alpha 1AT found in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract, we observed that smokers' macrophages caused a 60 +/- 5% reduction in the ability of alpha 1AT to inhibit neutrophil elastase. In marked contrast, under the same conditions, nonsmokers' macrophages had no effect upon the anti-neutrophil elastase function of alpha 1AT. Addition of superoxide dismutase, catalase, mannitol, and methionine prevented inactivation of alpha 1AT by smokers' macrophages, implying that the release of oxidants mediated the inactivation of alpha 1AT. In addition, by utilizing a recombinant DNA produced modified form of alpha 1AT containing an active site substitution (met358----val), the inactivation of alpha 1AT by smokers' alveolar macrophages was prevented, suggesting that the smokers' macrophages inactivate alpha 1AT by oxidizing the active site of the alpha 1AT molecule. These results suggest that in cigarette smokers, the alveolar macrophage can modulate the activity of alpha 1AT as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase and thus play a role in the pathogenesis of emphysema associated with cigarette smoking.\r"

  ".W": "Alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency resulting from homozygous inheritance of the Z-type alpha 1AT gene is associated with serum alpha 1AT levels of less than 50 mg/dl and the development of emphysema in the third to fourth decades. Despite the overwhelming evidence that the emphysema of PiZZ individuals develops because of a \"deficiency\" of alpha 1AT and hence an insufficient antineutrophil elastase defense of the lung, epidemiologic evidence has shown that levels of alpha 1AT of only 80 mg/dl protect the lung from an increased risk of emphysema. With this background, we hypothesized that homozygous inheritance of the Z-type may confer an added risk beyond a simple deficiency of alpha 1AT by virtue of an inability of the Z-type alpha 1AT molecule to inhibit neutrophil elastase as effectively as the common M1-type molecule. To evaluate this hypothesis, the functional status of alpha 1AT from PiZZ individuals (n = 10) was compared with that of alpha 1AT from PiM1M1 individuals (n = 7) for its ability to inhibit neutrophil elastase (percent inhibition) as well as its association rate constant for neutrophil elastase (K association). Plasma alpha 1AT concentration, measured by radial immunodiffusion, was 34 +/- 1 mg/dl in PiZZ patients vs. 237 +/- 14 mg/dl for PiM1M1 plasma, a sevenfold difference. When titrated against neutrophil elastase, the present inhibition of PiZZ plasma was significantly less than Pi M1M1 plasma (ZZ 78 +/- 1% vs. M1M1 95 +/- 1%, P less than 0.001) as was purified Z type alpha 1AT (ZZ, 63 +/- 2% vs. M1M1 86 +/- 2%, P less than 0.001). Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) gel comparisons of the complexes formed with M1-type alpha 1AT and Z-type alpha 1AT with elastase demonstrated the Z alpha 1AT-elastase complexes were less stable than the M1 alpha 1AT-elastase complexes, thus releasing some of the enzyme to continue to function as a protease. Consistent with these observations, the K association of purified Z-type alpha 1AT for neutrophil elastase was lower than that of M1-type alpha 1AT (ZZ 4.5 +/- 0.3 X 10(6) M-1s-1 vs. M1M1 9.7 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P less than 0.001), suggesting that for the population of alpha 1AT molecules, the active Z-type molecules take more than twice as long as the active M1-type alpha 1AT to inhibit neutrophil elastase.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

Bcl-2, while B cell associated, is expressed in a variety of hematopoietic lineages including T cells. Bcl-2 mRNA levels are high during pre-B cell development, the time at which the t(14;18) translocation occurs, but are down regulated with maturation. Like certain other oncogenes, Bcl-2 is quiescent in resting B cells but up-regulated with B cell activation. Mature B cell lymphomas with a t(14;18) have log-folds more mRNA than matched counterparts without the translocation. A sensitive S1 protection assay revealed that all transcripts in t(14;18) B cells were Bcl-2-Ig fusion mRNAs and originated from the translocated allele. Thus, there is a marked deregulation of Bcl-2 when it is introduced into the Ig locus in t(14;18) lymphomas.\r"

  ".W": "We have studied the complex interrelationships between platelets, Factor XIa, alpha 1-protease inhibitor and Factor IX activation. Platelets were shown to secrete an inhibitor of Factor XIa, and to protect Factor XIa from inactivation in the presence of alpha 1-protease inhibitor and the secreted platelet inhibitor. This protection of Factor XIa did not arise from the binding of Factor XIa to platelets, the presence of high molecular weight kininogen, or the inactivation of alpha 1-protease inhibitor by platelets. The formation of a complex between alpha 1-protease inhibitor and the active-site-containing light chain of Factor XIa was inhibited by activated platelets and by platelet releasates, but not by high molecular weight kininogen. These results support the hypothesis that platelets can regulate Factor XIa-catalyzed Factor IX activation by secreting an inhibitor of Factor XIa that may act primarily outside the platelet microenvironment and by protecting Factor XIa from inhibition, thereby localizing Factor IX activation to the platelet plug.\r"

  ".W": "Treatment of healthy rats and mice with a single intravenous injection of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) caused a dose-dependent gastrointestinal inflammation. Within 30 min gastric emptying was blocked and tissue edema occurred in the small and large intestine. In the cecum hemorrhage occurred after 4 h at doses greater than or equal to 250 micrograms/kg. The cecum exhibited an acute inflammatory response following rHuTNF-alpha treatment similar to that seen in tumor necrosis at the same dose. The vascular endothelium became swollen, increased numbers of neutrophils and other leukocytes attached to and penetrated the endothelium, and finally hemorrhage occurred. Treatment of rats with daily injections of rHuTNF-alpha (250 micrograms/kg per d) for 3 wk failed to produce cachexia. Within 24-48 h rats became resistant to the hemorrhagic effect of rHuTNF-alpha, however, the cytokine still caused a transitory block of gastric emptying after 10 d of treatment. Treatment at 5- or 10-d intervals produced results similar to the initial injection. These results suggest that maximum hemorrhagic response will occur when rHuTNF-alpha is administered at intervals of 5-10 d rather than daily.\r"

  ".W": "We have analyzed T cell receptor alpha-chain gene configuration using three genomic joining (J) region probes in 64 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 11 out of 18 T-ALLs were T3 positive; alpha-chain gene rearrangements were demonstrated in only two of 18, indicating that the majority of T-ALLs would have rearrangements involving J alpha segments located upstream of these probes. In contrast, 15 out of 46 B-precursor ALLs showed rearrangements of the alpha-chain gene and J alpha segments located approximately 20-30 kb upstream of the constant region were involved in 13 of these patients. Nine of 15 B-precursor ALLs with rearranged alpha-chain genes had rearrangements of both gamma- and beta-chain genes, whereas the remaining six had no rearrangements of gamma- and beta-chain genes. These findings indicated that alpha-chain gene rearrangement is not specific for T lineage cells and gamma- and/or beta-chain gene rearrangement does not appear essential for alpha-chain gene rearrangement, at least in B-precursor leukemic cells.\r"

  ".W": "In vivo ultraviolet (UV) exposure of human skin abrogates the antigen-presenting function of T6+ DR+ Langerhans cells and induces the appearance of antigen-presenting T6- DR+ epidermal melanophages. UV-exposed epidermal cells containing T6- DR+ epidermal antigen-presenting cells, in contrast to unexposed epidermal cells containing T6+ DR+ Langerhans cells, potently activate autoreactive regulatory T cells in the absence of exogenous antigens. Autoreactive T cells may be important for regulation of other immune responses such as those which occur in photosensitive lupus erythematosus and in immune surveillance of UV-induced skin cancers. It is therefore imperative to determine the factors that govern their appearance in the skin. It was found that UVB and UVC, but not UVA, induced a dose-dependent appearance of T6- DR+ epidermal melanophages. The optimal time of appearance was 2 or 3 days after UVB and UVC exposure. In contrast, UVA was a poor inducer of T6- DR+ cells at all doses and all time points tested. Although UVA was a poor inducer of T6- DR+ epidermal cells, UVA radiation resulted in depletion of T6+ DR+ Langerhans cells from the epidermis, as did UVB and UVC radiation. This differential effect of UV wave bands on the immunocompetent cells in human skin may be related to the greater potential of UVB exposure to induce skin cancers and to exacerbate systemic lupus erythematosus.\r"

The herpes infection was not amenable to therapy with acyclovir. Clinical isolates of herpes simplex virus were assessed for viral thymidine kinase activity, which was markedly decreased in two isolates. By the method of viral plaque autoradiography, these isolates were determined to be composed primarily of mutant thymidine kinase-negative herpes simplex virus mixed with occasional standard thymidine kinase-positive herpes simplex virus. Viral plaque autoradiography permitted the quantitation of proportions of thymidine kinase-negative and thymidine kinase-positive herpes simplex virus in the mixed virus populations. The chronic cutaneous infection persisted, unlike other reported infections by thymidine kinase-negative herpes simplex virus.\r"

Antibodies reactive with the core protein of HTLV-I were also identified in her husband and mother but not in her 2-year-old daughter. Examination of the patient's course provides clues about the latency period and transmission of HTLV-I and highlights similarities between HTLV-I-positive and HTLV-I-negative cutaneous T cell lymphoma.\r"

Candidate variables for an aging battery were identified in a cross-sectional analysis by performing a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the effects of age, sex, and diet on each of 72 variables. Twenty-eight variables were found to be influenced by age. By examining patterns of differences among means, 20 variables were identified that show promise of being useful, including, for example, rectal body temperature, blood albumin, immunoglobulin A, fingernail growth rate, bone thickness, and blood calcium. The set of variables used to estimate biological aging might not be identical for all age-sex classes.\r"
