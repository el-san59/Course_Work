We describe the procedures the states use to determine when to issue consumption advisories and we evaluate the associated cancer risks using EPA-IARC-OSTP risk assessment procedures. Projected cancer risks are high for consumers of small quantities of sport fish contaminated with DDT or dieldrin at their respective action levels. Projected risks at concentrations that are common but below the action levels are also substantial. We propose that sport fish with tissue concentrations of DDT or dieldrin one-fifth and one-third of the action levels should be covered by consumption advisories to warn consumers of the potential adverse health impacts.\r"

Special attention is given to the task of model selection, which involves selection of the model form, selection of the variables to enter the model, and selection of the form of these variables in the model. Several conclusions are drawn, among them: a) model and variable forms should be selected based on regression diagnostic procedures, in addition to goodness-of-fit tests; b) variable-selection algorithms in current packaged programs, such as conventional stepwise regression, can easily lead to invalid estimates and tests of effect; and c) variable selection is better approached by direct estimation of the degree of confounding produced by each variable than by significance-testing algorithms. As a general rule, before using a model to estimate effects, one should evaluate the assumptions implied by the model against both the data and prior information.\r"

  ".W": "The development of Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis in a natural sand fly host, Lutzomyia gomezi, was studied by light and transmission electron microscopy. New aspects of peripylarian parasite behavior and morphology in the sand fly gut, early bloodmeal stages, and ultrastructural development in the anterior gut were documented. Eight distinct morphological forms were observed in the life cycle of the parasite within the insect. In the bloodmeal, amastigotes (1) transformed into stumpy promastigotes (2) which rapidly multiplied, resulting in spatulate-shaped nectomonad promastigotes (3) and elongate nectomonad promastigotes (4). These latter forms migrated primarily into the hindgut, where both were observed attached (=haptomonad phase) to the cuticular intima by hemidesmosomes within extremely shortened flagella. Spatulate haptomonad promastigotes predominated, colonizing the entire length of the hindgut, with the greatest density at 2 disjunct sites: the pylorus/ileum and the anterior rectum/rectal sac. Paramastigotes and dividing flagellates were rare. Some parasites migrated directly to the cardia/stomodeal valve region without a hindgut phase; however, major movement anteriorly was from the hindgut beginning at 6 days postinfection. In the cardia lumen, dividing short Type A promastigotes (5) predominated, intermixed with short Type B promastigotes with longer flagella (6). Paramastigotes (7) were free-swimming in the lumen as well as attached to the stomodeal valve. The primary colonizers of the valve were pear-shaped haptomonad promastigotes (8), with flagella of variable lengths and multi-segmented hemidesmosomal attachment points to the intima. Promastigotes and paramastigotes colonized the esophagus-pharynx region and attached to the foregut lining by flagellar hemidesmosomes. Both forms may represent infective stages of L. (V.) panamensis; however, no parasites were detected in the cibarium or proboscis. L. (V.) panamensis appeared well-adapted to the gut of Lu. gomezi, multiplying extensively at 2 sites, changing morphological form, and adhering to host surfaces by variously modified flagellar hemidesmosomes.\r"

Virus isolations were made in 1985 from 6 patients with CTF. These isolates were distinct from each other and the field isolates. Although the CTF isolates were different by PAGE profile, the majority of the 12 genes were highly conserved among the 1985 isolates and a Florio isolate (FMA). Only genes 4 and 6 were variant among the 1985 CTF isolates and FMA, and no unique genes were identified. In 1986, a follow-up field survey was done at the Campos Cabin site. Of the 3 CTF PAGE genotypes obtained, 2 exhibited PAGE profiles which were different from the 1985 isolates. One isolate may have resulted from the reassortment of genes from 2 of the isolates circulating at Campos Cabin in 1985.\r"

The prime etiologic factor behind most herniorrhaphy failures is the suturing together, under tension, of structures that are not normally in apposition. With the use of modern mesh prosthetics, it is now possible to repair all hernias without distortion of the normal anatomy and with no suture line tension. The technique is simple, rapid, less painful, and effective, allowing prompt resumption of unrestricted physical activity.\r"

One hundred eighty-five patients with colorectal carcinoma underwent resection for cure. Of these patients, 40 received diluted formalin intraluminally for prevention of local recurrence, and the remainder received no cancericidal agent. Distribution by tumor size and stage was similar in both groups. Local recurrence occurred in 2.6 percent of formalin-treated patients and 14.3 percent of untreated patients. The difference in recurrence rates was significant (p less than 0.05). No significant difference between the two groups was present in the actuarial survival curves. The 5-year survival rate was 66.6 percent in the formalin-treated group and 50.5 percent in the control group. No suture line recurrences were observed in the treated group. Our results indicate that intraluminal fixation of cancer cells before opening the bowel is an effective method of reducing local recurrence after resection of colorectal cancer.\r"

When compared with data from a large Japanese study, early gastric cancer in the United States tends to develop more distally in the stomach and in patients approximately one decade older.

Over an 11-year period, 785 patients underwent aortic reconstruction.

Seventy-three (18 percent) were found to have gallbladder disease. Thirteen had symptoms attributed to cholelithiasis and underwent cholecystectomy with aortic reconstruction. Three hundred eighty-one were left with the gallbladder after aortic reconstruction, 60 in whom disease was identified and 321 with normal oral cholecystography results. Three patients developed cholecystitis in the postoperative period, one in the diseased group and two with normal gallbladders. The incidence of postoperative cholecystitis was 0.8 percent (3 patients). Preoperative oral cholecystography is of little value as a screening tool. Cholecystectomy during aortic reconstruction is probably safe and the risk of postoperative cholecystitis in the asymptomatic patient is negligible.\r"

For palpable tumors, mammography is used to determine tumor size and to identify nonpalpable multifocal or contralateral lesions. Mammography is an important adjunct to physical examination when monitoring for local recurrence in the irradiated breast or when searching for second primary cancers in the contralateral breast. Axillary nodes are evaluated by direct palpation, but some investigators recommend lymphoscintigraphy to examine the internal mammary chain. The most common sites for distant metastases are the skeleton, lung, brain, and liver. Although radionuclide scanning is currently the most effective method to evaluate metastases to bone, plain radiography, and sometimes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, are required to corroborate radionuclide findings. However, due to cost constraints and anticipated low yield, routine imaging for metastases should be limited to chest radiography.\r"

  ".U": "89133129\r", 
  ".W": "Since the mitral anulus is now known to be saddle-shaped, use of the qualitative motion of the mitral valve (MV) leaflets in the apical four-chamber plane to diagnose mitral valve prolapse (MVP) may be unsound, in that superior systolic displacement of the MV leaflets would occur in normal subjects, as well as in patients with MVP. It has therefore been suggested that the parasternal long axis (PLAX) plane should be used to diagnose MVP. To test the feasibility of this approach, the authors examined the predictive accuracy of PLAX prolapse and other isolated echocardiographic abnormalities versus a multivariate decision tree approach. PLAX prolapse, which was significantly associated with marked (greater than 0.7 cm) apical four-chamber prolapse, mitral regurgitation, the presence of a thick mitral valve, and low relative body weight, was 100% specific for MVP but only 44% sensitive. Similarly, marked apical four-chamber prolapse was 100% specific but only 53% sensitive. Apical four-chamber prolapse, if gauged only qualitatively as present or absent, was 94% sensitive but only 50% specific. By contrast, the decision tree classified all 32 initial patients correctly, and in a second, test set, selected 6 additional patients; these 6 patients had many of the clinical features of MVP. These observations suggest that: (1) if prolapse is seen in the PLAX plane, the patient does have MVP; on the other hand, lack of prolapse in this plane does not exclude the diagnosis of MVP and (2) the apical four-chamber plane, used qualitatively, does not reliably distinguish patients with MVP from those without MVP.\r"

At the onset of the syncope, arterial blood pressure was extremely low, and the electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.

The risk factors studied were male sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, sedentary life-style, and family history. The prevalence of these risk factors in the two groups of patients was compared. The results suggest that in persons greater than or equal to 60 years old, male sex and cigarette smoking continue to remain risk factors for CAD. Since most of the patients with diabetes and hypertension were on medical management for their condition, the authors' findings also suggest that diabetes mellitus, even under treatment, remains an important risk factor for CAD in the elderly but controlled hypertension does not. Other traditional risk factors (hypercholesterolemia, sedentary life-style, and family history) do not discriminate individuals with moderate to severe CAD from those with normal or near-normal coronary arteries in persons greater than or equal to sixty years old.\r"

The premature-stimulus-induced widening of the atrial wave was observed in some cases who had normal size of atrium and no heart failure. The widening was augmented by administration of verapamil but not by procainamide, suggesting that for such widening or fragmented activity, slow-fiber-mediated conduction seems to be responsible. One case with intraatrial reentrant tachycardia developed fragmentation lasting for 1.0 second after verapamil. Therefore, some apparently normal atria may have a subclinical electrophysiologic abnormality that can be disclosed by premature stimulations or verapamil.\r"

  ".W": "Data from several epidemiologic studies have suggested that, among other variables, hematocrit and fibrinogen may constitute risk factors for high blood pressure. As part of a population survey for cardiovascular risk factors, plasma viscosity and hemoglobin were measured. Blood pressure was determined under standardized conditions according to the recommendations of the AHA. A two-stage age-sex-stratified cluster sample of 5,312 persons, aged twenty-five to sixty-four years, was selected from a mixed urban/rural target population of 282,279 (total population approximately 533,000). A net response of 79.3% was achieved. Multiple logistic regression analyses including plasma viscosity, hemoglobin, body mass index, alcohol consumption, smoking behavior, and total serum cholesterol as independent variables were run controlling for both age and sex. Plasma viscosity appeared as a significant main effect in all analyses and demonstrated the strongest association with high blood pressure next to body mass index. Whether this association implies a causal relationship cannot be answered from cross-sectional data. However, even if plasma hyperviscosity represents a secondary phenomenon in hypertension, it might be of prognostic relevance. There is evidence that increased plasma viscosity may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy. Therefore hypertensives with impaired blood fluidity might constitute a subgroup at particular risk for cardiovascular complications. When antihypertensive drugs are selected, their influence on blood viscosity should be taken into account.\r"

Twelve patients with stable intermittent claudication who were regular smokers attended on two occasions within one week and treadmill tests were performed after 1/2, 1, 1 1/2, and 2 hours. Immediately before the second exercise test, two standard cigarettes were smoked or an unlit cigarette was \"sham-smoked.\" Because participants could not be blinded, an attempt to control for patient bias was made. Half were told that we expected smoking to make no difference or possibly cause some improvement, and half were told that we expected it to make no difference or possibly cause some deterioration. These explanations and the order of study days were determined by balanced randomization. Suggestion had a significant influence on claudication distance immediately after smoking (p less than 0.01) but no significant effect on walking distance. Combining data from both groups assumes that no overall bias was introduced by the explanations given. Immediately after smoking, small, nonsignificant increases in claudication distance (+10%, 95% CI-7%, +27%) and walking distance (+9%, 95% CI-2%, +19%) were observed. Smoking caused a mean increase in heart rate of 9 beats per minute, which persisted for one hour, but no consistent change in blood pressure. The results show that suggestion may have a significant influence on treadmill exercise distances. Smoking is unlikely to have an important acute effect on exercise performance in claudicants.\r"

Both PC and the three glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) did not influence collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In contrast, all the tested GAGs blocked thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. HE and HS were equivalent and very effective, while DS was also but to a lesser extent. This could be because HE and HS act via both antithrombin III and heparin-cofactor II, whereas DS exerts its action on the latter only. PC, too, inhibited, in a dose-dependent fashion, thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, probably by competing with the thrombin affinity binding sites on the platelet surface. When the GAGs were tested together with PC, HE was shown to be the most effective: on a weight-for-weight basis, an identical amount of PC was unable to counteract the inhibitory effect of HE, while it partially reversed those of DS and HS. A full reversal of the inhibitory effect of DS and HS was never observed, in spite of adding increasing amounts of PC. It seems likely that plasma components may preserve the bindings of such GAGs with their cofactors.\r"

Moreover, dipyridamole pretreatment was able to antagonize the reduction of peak flow induced by nifedipine, and the potentiating effect of flunarizine on postischemic hyperemia was affected significantly by theophylline, thus suggesting a possible interference of calcium entry blocker drugs with the endogenous adenosine system. In a cellular model (polymorphonuclear leukocytes--PMN) the inhibitory effect of calcium entry blockers on stimulated functions (degranulation and free radical production) was highly antagonized by theophylline. Finally, a 1H-NMR spectroscopy study showed a binding interaction between adenosine and flunarizine on the cell membrane.

A logistic regression (LR) model had a positive predictive value for cardiac deaths of 100% (10/10) with 8% (4/53) false negatives. Evaluating LV performance indices exclusively, LR analysis showed that only peak filling rate had independent predictive value. Subnormal and normal LV ejection fractions were associated with equal three-year cardiac death rates (29%). Depressed LV function was related to residual hypertrophy. Impaired diastolic performance was the prime predictor of cardiac deaths.\r"

Ethanol concentration data were fitted to one-compartment open model assuming Michaelis Menten elimination kinetics. During hypothermia, ethanol concentrations were consistently higher than during normothermia. This observation could be explained by both a significantly smaller distribution volume of ethanol during hypothermia (0.71 +/- 0.03 L/kg at 29 C and 0.84 +/- 0.05 L/kg at 37 C, P less than .02) and a significantly slower maximum velocity of metabolism of ethanol (Vm) during hypothermia (1.12 +/- 0.11 mg/kg.min vs. 1.83 +/- 0.21 mg/kg.min, P less than .01). Our study indicates that during hypothermia, ethanol stays significantly longer in the circulation in piglets. Potentially, this may contribute to a more profound effect from the ethanol.\r"

We used a reproducible, lightly anesthetized model of porcine continuous hemorrhage to evaluate the usefulness of pre-hospital IV fluid therapy. Incorporated into the model were time delays associated with ambulance request and dispatch, patient evaluation and treatment, and transport to the hospital in the average urban prehospital care system. Treatment occurred concurrently with hemorrhage. Twenty-eight immature swine (15 to 20 kg) were bled at a rate of 1.25 mL/kg/min. Animals in the prehospital IV group (n = 14) received fluid resuscitation at 1 mL/kg/min beginning 20 minutes after initiation of hemorrhage; those in the in-hospital IV group (n = 14) received fluid at a rate of 3 mL/kg/min beginning 35 minutes after hemorrhage. Both groups received blood and saline at 3 mL/kg/min 45 minutes after hemorrhage began, and both groups had hemorrhage controlled 25 minutes after simulated hospital arrival. Survival was 57% in both groups, and there were no statistically significant differences seen in measured hemodynamic or biochemical parameters.

A feline model tested the efficacy of low-flow oxygen delivery, and initial data were gathered to define proper catheter calibers to effect adequate oxygenation and ventilation. Cats were anesthetized, trachea intubated, and ventilated for 30 minutes with a pressure-regulated ventilator. Arterial and venous pressures were monitored, and a chest tube was inserted to measure intrathoracic pressures. Arterial blood gas analysis was performed every five minutes during the baseline period. The endotracheal tube was then removed, the trachea cross-clamped, and TNCV instituted. Oxygen flow rates of 1, 3, and 5 L/min were varied with catheter sizes of 14, 16, and 18 g. Data demonstrated that TNCV provided adequate oxygenation and ventilation with flow rates of 3 and 5 L/min with the 14- and 16-g catheters. Satisfactory oxygenation could be obtained with these flow rates with the 18-g catheter, but ventilation was inadequate. Ventilation was unsatisfactory with the 1 L/min flow rate in all catheter sizes. These preliminary data indicate that a minimum catheter:trachea cross-sectional area ratio of 0.03 may be required to obtain oxygenation and ventilation with low-flow oxygen rates of 3 to 5 L/min in cats.\r"

  ".W": "We developed a computer simulation model of emergency department operations using simulation software. This model uses multiple levels of preemptive patient priority; assigns each patient to an individual nurse and physician; incorporates all standard tests, procedures, and consultations; and allows patient service processes to proceed simultaneously, sequentially, repetitively, or a combination of these. Selected input data, including the number of physicians, nurses, and treatment beds, and the blood test turnaround time, then were varied systematically to determine their simulated effect on patient throughput time, selected queue sizes, and rates of resource utilization. Patient throughput time varied directly with laboratory service times and inversely with the number of physician or nurse servers. Resource utilization rates varied inversely with resource availability, and patient waiting time and patient throughput time varied indirectly with the level of patient acuity. The simulation can be animated on a computer monitor, showing simulated patients, specimens, and staff members moving throughout the ED. Computer simulation is a potentially useful tool that can help predict the results of changes in the ED system without actually altering it and may have implications for planning, optimizing resources, and improving the efficiency and quality of care.\r"

Targeting significantly increased the percentage of senior citizen participants and participants who took the course because they or a close friend or relative had cardiac disease (P less than .00001). These data have important implications regarding potential future CPR training course recruitment methods compared with nontargeted recruitment approaches.\r"

The average number of patients seeking care was 3.93 +/- 0.95 per 1,000 visitors (daily range, 1.94 to 6.8). Patient loads were linearly related to gate attendance, but the correlation was imperfect (P less than .001, r = .63). Only 4.4% of patients evaluated on site by nurses and paramedics were referred for additional testing and treatment: of these patients, 30% had suspected serious musculoskeletal injury, 16% had abdominal pain, and 25% had complaints of chest pain, dizziness, or loss of consciousness. Lay employees (security personnel) were trained to use automatic external defibrillators. There were six cardiac arrests (0.3 per million visitors). Two patients collapsed with ventricular fibrillation, were defibrillated by lay personnel, quickly regained consciousness, and survived. The other arrests were associated with asystole or electromechanical dissociation; no shocks were inappropriately given, and all four died. We conclude that four of every 1,000 persons at this assembly sought emergency medical care, that 95% of the problems seen were minor with few requiring physician skills, and that the automatic external defibrillator was suited for this setting and could be used by lay responders to provide early definitive treatment.\r"

Thoracic injuries included rib fractures, pneumothorax, and hemothorax. Secondary impact resulted in several craniofacial and upper extremity injuries. Chronic neurologic disability and prolonged morbidity were common. One patient died; the patient who fell 100 ft survived. After initial stabilization, survival is possible after falls or jumps from heights as great as 100 feet It is important to recognize the skeletal and internal organs at risk from high-magnitude vertical forces.\r"

One hundred five women with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection were studied prospectively. Each woman had a MSCC urine sample obtained initially, followed by a CATH sample. The MSCC and CATH urine samples were analyzed and compared for urine culture, leukocyte esterase, nitrites, microscopic bacteriuria, and pyuria. Of the 105 patients, 42 (40%) had a culture-proven urinary tract infection. The concordance rates between MSCC and CATH urine cultures, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, significant microscopic bacteriuria, and pyuria were 96%, 94%, 93%, 90%, and 90%, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between MSCC and CATH sensitivities, specificities, or positive or negative predictive values for any urinalysis variable (leukocyte esterase, nitrites, significant microscopic bacteriuria, or pyuria). We conclude that if proper MSCC technique is used, the differences between MSCC and CATH urinalyses or urine cultures do not appear to be significant in the majority of ambulatory women without active vaginal bleeding who present with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection.\r"

Thirty-four children requiring laceration repair were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: 30% N2O/70% O2 or a placebo, 100% O2. Pain behavior, using the observer-scored Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale, was assessed by double-blind techniques, before and during the laceration repair. Less pain behavior was seen in children less than 8 years old who received the N2O mixture than in those receiving the placebo. In patients 8 or more years old who received N2O, there was a significant improvement in the second evaluation as compared with those receiving only O2 during the procedure (P less than .05). There also was a smaller increase in pain behavior, from the first to the second evaluation, in those receiving N2O (P less than .05). No side effects were encountered. The authors conclude that continuous N2O inhalation is an effective and painless analgesic in children for outpatient procedures. More effective analgesia will likely occur with 40% to 50% N2O, although these concentrations remain to be studied in pediatric outpatients.\r"

Combined respiratory and metabolic acidosis and concomitant extreme hypercalcemia and hypermagnesemia, reaching serum levels up to 28.8 and 33 mg/dL, respectively, were responsible for most of the clinical findings. The adult mortality was 19%. Four pediatric patients with variable degrees of intoxication survived. Discriminant function analysis determined that admission serum calcium concentration of more than 15.5 mg/dL was the best predictor of mortality. In patients with severe intoxication, supportive medical treatment, including forced diuresis, was disappointing. Early dialysis for severe cases merits further study.\r"

We present the case of a 19-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa and long-term laxative abuse who, despite a normal baseline serum magnesium concentration, developed hypermagnesemia during treatment with multiple doses of activated charcoal-magnesium citrate for acute salicylate intoxication. The peak serum magnesium concentration, after two doses of magnesium citrate, reached 9.8 mg/dL (4.0 mmol/L). It fell to normal levels when sorbitol was substituted as a cathartic and after the patient had been hemodialyzed for symptoms of salicylate toxicity that continued despite conventional therapy. While disordered magnesium metabolism in one patient with a severe underlying medical condition should not interdict the use of repetitive doses of magnesium citrate as a cathartic, patients requiring such therapy should have serum magnesium concentrations measured serially to monitor for signs of magnesium loading.\r"

These patients have five-year survival rates in excess of 90 per cent. Although frequently seen in Japan, the detection of ECG remains uncommon in the United States. Twenty-two patients with EGC over a 15-year period were reviewed. EGC was identified in 0.5 per cent (1/207) of all gastric cancers before the widespread use of endoscopy (1972-1979) in our institution and in 16.5 per cent (21/127) of such patients after endoscopy began to replace barium contrast studies (1980-1987). Radiographic studies were performed initially in 14 out of 22 patients with EGC, and in ten patients were reported as normal. Endoscopy was used to make the diagnosis of EGC in 21 of 22 patients. Nineteen of the 22 patients are currently alive and free of disease (86%) with a mean follow-up of 3.4 years (range 6 months to 12 years). Our experience has paralleled that of the Japanese in that, with the adoption of fiberoptic endoscopy as the first-line diagnostic modality in patients with GI complaints, the detection of EGC has significantly increased.\r"

Further surgical intervention may be necessary because of failure to lose weight or complications associated with the previous operation such as intolerable reflux symptoms. Revision from a horizontal to a vertical staple line may result in a stenosis at the site of the gastro-gastrostomy. This study examines the authors' experience with balloon dilation of these strictures. Between May, 1981 and September, 1987, 12 of 113 patients who had revision of previous gastric reduction procedures developed either gastro-gastrostomy stenosis or stenosis above the Marlex collar (2 patients). Endoscopic balloon dilatation was attempted in all 12 patients. Eight females and four males (average age, 42 years) had undergone either a previous vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) (2 patients), gastric bypass, or horizontal gastroplasty as their initial operation. Revision was performed for failure of the initial operation to control weight, obstructive symptoms, or gastroesophageal reflux. Balloon dilatation was possible in 11 of 12 patients. The majority required less than four dilations to alleviate obstructive symptoms. Balloon dilatation is effective in the management of gastro-gastrostomy stenosis following revision of gastric stapling procedures.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1982, the medical literature as well as the lay press discussed an artificial bezoar, the gastric bubble, as an adjuvant in the treatment of morbid obesity. Approved by the FDA, the Garren-Edwards Gastric Bubble has been reported by the company to have been placed over 17,000 times. Due to a reported increased rate of deflation after three months, removal and reimplantation of a new bubble is recommended. After deflation, some difficulty in retrieval of the bubble has been reported. The authors report a new technique for bubble extraction. The bubble is visualized through a gastroscope and deflated using bicap cautery. The gastroscope is removed. The endo-overtube is placed on the gastroscope and this assembly is reintroduced through the esophagus to the level of the GE junction. The deflated bubble is visualized, grasped with a forceps, and withdrawn into the endo-overtube until becoming wedged. The entire assembly (gastroscope, overtube, forceps, and gastric bubble) are removed. With this technique, bubble removal has been simplified and has decreased the procedure length to approximately fifteen minutes.\r"

  ".W": "There has been a considerable amount of experience with removal of rectal foreign bodies inserted transanally. Until recently removal of objects above the rectosigmoid junction has required laparotomy. A literature review reveals that since 1975 there have been 29 cases of colonoscopic removal of a variety of objects reported in fourteen publications. The authors have had experience with three cases of retained colonic foreign bodies (greater than 7 days) extracted using the colonoscope. All patients received preprocedure antibiotics and bowel preparation from below. All objects were removed using either the Olympus CF LB3R colonoscope or the Fujinon EVC-M videocolonoscope. The authors conclude that colonoscopic retrieval of foreign bodies is technically feasible, safe, less morbid, and less costly than laparotomy. This technique should be considered as the first step in management of these patients by endoscopic surgeons.\r"

Results of this survey have shown a significant involvement in flexible gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures by most surgical services, especially those affiliated with major resident teaching programs. Total number of procedures performed, based on the projections of numbers of cases as reported, indicate that approximately 60,000 gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are currently performed by surgeons each year in the Veterans Administration system in order to assess the greater than 90,000 gastrointestinal operations performed. Results of the survey also indicate that Chiefs of Surgery in the VA system enjoy a wide range of support by Gastrointestinal (GI) Medical Services in the VA, but generally this support is adequate. Part-time and full-time surgeons in the VA need to increase overall Continuing Education activities in endoscopy as well as increase the number of surgeons affiliated with organizations interested in endoscopic care.\r"

  ".U": "89133256\r", 
  ".W": "Unlike the Nd:YAG, the CO2 laser produces well circumscribed tissue removal with little unwanted damage because of its high absorption coefficient relative to tissue water. Unfortunately, conventional quartz fibers cannot transmit wavelengths greater than three microns, well below the ten micron wavelength of the CO2 laser. Thus, fiberoptic transmission of CO2 laser requires use of exotic materials that lack the excellent properties of quartz fibers and that, in some cases, are toxic or chemically unstable. However, there are large peaks in the infrared absorption curve of water in the two to three micron region. Lasers that operate in this mid-infrared region should permit CO2-like precision of cutting, along with excellent transmission through quartz fiberoptics. Two mid-infrared lasers with a fiberoptic delivery system, the Er:YAG (2.94 micron) and the Tm-Ho-Cr:YAG (2.15 micron) have been evaluated with human colon tissue in vitro and with rabbit gastric tissue in vivo. Histologic sections reveal excellently well localized lesions with minimal underlying thermal damage. Depth of penetration is controllable and occurs in very small increments. There is little spreading of the lesions at the 24 hour mark resulting from secondary thermal damage. Based on these facts, the authors think that these lasers will be of benefit to endoscopic surgeons.\r"

These cases were retrospectively reviewed to document the need for total endoscopy during PEG. Ninety-seven per cent of the procedures were successful. In 89 per cent, a complete exam of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum was performed, revealing pathologic findings in 59 per cent. The most common abnormalities were in the esophagus (23%) and the stomach (27%); however, a portion of the findings were also present in the duodenum (12%) and the pylorus (11%). Additional findings present in the complete esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) done at the time of PEG included a five per cent incidence of gastric outlet obstruction and antral ulcers or polyps in six per cent. The breakdown of findings in the duodenum included eight per cent incidence of duodenal ulcers and four per cent incidence of duodenitis. A total of 22 per cent of the patients had some evidence of peptic ulcer disease. Many of the cases in which pathology was found required a change in medications and, when postoperative bleeding occurred after PEG, the other pathologic entity was much more likely to be the cause of the complication than the PEG. A careful and complete EGD is mandated every time a patient is scheduled for PEG.\r"

The authors retrospectively examined the results of 27 PCs performed on 22 patients at the University of Louisville Affiliated Hospitals from 1980 to 1987. Indications for PC included: suspected choledocholithiasis stricture, sclerosing cholangitis, and cholangiocarcinoma. The biliary tree was accessed through a T-tube tract in 18 patients, and through a biliary-enterocutaneous fistula in four patients. The patient population included 11 men and 11 women with a mean age of 62 years. T-tubes varied in size from #16F to #24F. The time allowed for T-tube tract maturation ranged from four weeks to five months. Percutaneous choledochoscopy was performed 16 times in 13 patients for possible choledocholithiasis. Stones were present in 13, and 11 of 13 attempted extractions were successful. Two patients underwent PC for stent placement. Nine procedures were performed on eight patients to obtain biopsies or to evaluate possible strictures. Four studies were normal, two patients had sclerosing cholangitis, one had a stricture of the Sphincter of Oddi, and one patient had benign ductal tissue on biopsy after an iridium implantation for cholangiocarcinoma. Two minor complications occurred in this series. The authors conclude that by using PC the surgeon may safely manage complicated biliary problems and avoid re-operation in selected cases.\r"

DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial with two consecutive regimens. SETTING: Immunopathology and hematology clinics at two general hospitals. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 34 patients infected with HIV who had thrombocytopenic purpura (platelets less than 50 x 10(9)/L) without visceral bleeding. Twenty-nine patients completed the study; one patient was removed because of drug toxicity. INTERVENTIONS: Zidovudine for 12 weeks, 250 mg every 6 hours orally in 10 patients; and 500 mg every 8 hours orally in 24 patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Three of ten patients receiving 250 mg every 6 hours and 12 of 24 patients receiving 500 mg every 8 hours had a persistent increase in their platelet counts. In both groups the mean value of the platelet count increased significantly by week 12; from 28 x 10(9)/L +/- 12 (SD) to 57 x 10(9)/L +/- 36 in the first group and from 20 x 10(9)/L +/- 13 to 77 x 10(9)/L +/- 42 in the second group (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Zidovudine is effective on platelet counts in some patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia. These results suggest that HIV itself may play a direct or indirect role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.\r"

STUDY DESIGN: A follow-up interview with 1928 adults who survived childhood cancer to evaluate the late effects of cancer and its treatment. Cancer was diagnosed in these survivors between 1945 and 1974 before they reached age 20: subjects had to have survived for at least 5 years and to have reached age 21. RESULTS: Fourteen percent of the survivors of malignancies at sites other than the central nervous system said that they had not had cancer. This proportion differed according to the survivors' race, the type of tumor and its treatment, the level of their father's education, the year of diagnosis, and the center where the tumor was diagnosed. Among survivors who knew that they had cancer previously, however, most (81%) correctly identified the type of treatment they had received. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be aware that a substantial proportion of long-term survivors of childhood cancer may not reveal their past history of cancer and its treatment, and possible clues to the cause of the presenting condition may thus be missed.\r"

  ".W": "Endoscopic laser surgery is an established means of treatment for benign laryngeal lesions. Laser surgery for early (stages I and II) squamous cell carcinoma is still being tested. Treatment of glottic tumors extending to the anterior commissure is in itself controversial. Approximately 20% of all glottic tumors involve the anterior commissure, with only 1% of these lesions being purely anterior commissure tumors. The anatomy of the anterior commissure is such that an apparent T1 lesion may actually be a T4 lesion if it involves the thyroid cartilage. The distance between the anterior commissure ligament and the thyroid cartilage is only 2 to 3 mm. A preoperative computed tomographic scan can aid us in evaluating this space. Therefore, tumors of the anterior commissure present as a therapeutic challenge. Radiation therapy has proven to be inadequate, with a high rate of recurrence and increased risk for radiochondronecrosis. The literature with regard to radiotherapy varies widely as to survival rates. Conservation surgery has consistently demonstrated an 80% survival in T1 lesions. Recently, it has been suggested that laser surgery in the region of the anterior commissure might offer satisfactory results. We have found the opposite. We will report on five patients who underwent endoscopic laser surgery on T1 vocal cord lesions involving the anterior commissure. All of these patients had tumor recurrence and subsequently have undergone salvage surgery and/or radiation therapy. The difficulties associated with endoscopic laser surgery of the anterior commissure will be discussed with a supporting animal study.\r"

We have reviewed the UCLA experience with patients who had head and neck cancers and pulmonary cancers no more than 5 years apart, and reviewed the literature on early stage lung cancer.

In two dogs the larynx was videotaped simultaneously via a telescope. Increased CT activity was induced by airway occlusion or hypercapnia. Observations were carried out before and during cold blockade of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) or the nerve to the CT (external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve [Ext SLN]). Paralysis of the CT had no effect on laryngeal resistance or glottic area, even at very high levels of CT activity. Blockade of the RLN increased inspiratory resistance, but did not have a significant effect on expiratory resistance. Electrical stimulation of the Ext SLN produced tetanic CT contraction, which increased laryngeal resistance in both inspiration and expiration. This was true even at very high levels of PCA activity. These results indicate that although artificially induced CT contraction markedly affects laryngeal resistance, physiologic levels of respiratory activity do not have a significant effect.\r"

Local control at 2 years was 96%, including one patient who was salvaged with total laryngectomy. Control of the neck was 90% at 2 years. Ninety percent of the patients alive at 2 years had a functional voice. One patient required a completion laryngectomy for chronic aspiration. Conservation surgery with radiotherapy provides excellent survival as well as locoregional control rates with preservation of function in selected patients with supraglottic cancer. This approach may be especially helpful in the management of bulky T2 lesions as well as T4 lesions with minimal vallecula or base of tongue involvement.\r"

All adults were right-handed. The results are summarized as follows. 1) The laryngeal framework was asymmetric to a greater or lesser extent in all larynges. 2) The degree of asymmetry did not differ among different age groups or between sexes. 3) In newborns, there was no directional preponderance in asymmetry. 4) In older adults, there was a directional preponderance in asymmetry. The right thyroid lamina tended to tilt laterally whereas the left lamina showed a tendency to tilt medially. The right cricoarytenoid joint tended to be located slightly more laterally, posteriorly, and inferiorly than the left joint. The longitudinal axis of the thyroid cartilage was inclined to shift to the right posteriorly against the axis of the cricoid cartilage. The thyroid cartilage as a whole tended to tilt to the right against the cricoid cartilage. 5) There must be some compensatory mechanisms for the asymmetric framework to keep the vocal fold edges relatively symmetric.\r"

The purpose of this study is to examine the sectional anatomy of the larynx with respect to the cricothyroid membrane and describe a suitable transcutaneous approach to endolaryngeal structures. Sixteen whole organ cadaveric larynges were frozen in clear gelatin to facilitate sectioning. Specimens were sectioned in the transaxial, sagittal, and coronal planes as well as 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees from the transaxial plane. For clinical orientation, the transaxial plane was defined as 90 degrees from the most anterior plane of the cricothyroid membrane. Sections were examined and angles and depths of penetration were measured with respect to the transcutaneous approach to endolaryngeal structures.\r"

Then the section of the thyroid cartilage on which the vocal fold muscle inserted was detached, connected to an isometric force transducer, and activated by indirect stimulation successively on both the operated and unoperated sides. A series of twitch contractions was recorded from each side. In two dogs no contractile response was obtained. In the three others, the twitch contraction time was increased significantly, by 23% to 60%. In two of three dogs, the operated muscle was significantly weaker than the unoperated muscle. The reinnervated thyroarytenoid muscle changed its speed in the direction of the donor sternothyroid muscle.\r"

The responses were fed into a resistance-to-frequency converter (IC 555 timer), and the output was frequency selected to generate auditory responses through a piezoelectric beeper. Quantitative estimates of responses from the IC output were computer averaged. Instantaneous obstruction detection was made possible by the immediate responsiveness of the device in the presence of obstruction.\r"

Innervation of vocal cord adductor muscles by those axons that depolarize during inspiration is particularly devastating to laryngeal function, since it produces medial vocal cord movement during inspiration. Many patients thought to have clinical bilateral vocal cord paralysis can be found to have synkinesis on at least one side. This will make the glottic airway smaller, particularly during inspiration, than would true paralysis of all the intrinsic laryngeal muscles. Patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis should undergo laryngeal electromyography. If inspiratory innervation of the adductor muscles is present, simple reinnervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle will fail. The adductor muscles also must be denervated by transection of the adductor division of the regenerated RLN.\r"

The dystonias, when classified by region of the body involved, have been characterized as focal, segmental, and generalized. Focal dystonia can affect jaw mechanics, leading to forceful contraction of the jaw muscles and resulting in inappropriate deviation of the jaw. Localized injections of botulinum toxin have been used successfully in the management of other focal or segmental dystonias. We have treated 20 oromandibular dystonia patients with botulinum toxin. Six patients had only jaw and tongue involvement; 11 had blepharospasm and jaw involvement; and three had jaw involvement as part of a more generalized dystonia. Five patients had been diagnosed originally and treated as having temporomandibular joint syndrome. All but one of the patients had improvement of their symptoms with the toxin injections. The patients averaged 47% improvement with the injections.\r"

These drivers were a subset of a representative sample (N = 342) of the driver population (N = approximately 2,000), and were not selected for hypertension or lead exposure. Blood lead concentrations ranged from 2-24 micrograms/dl (median: 6.9 micrograms/ld). There were 33 subjects treated primarily with diuretics, and 18 subjects were treated with beta blockers. Adjusted regression coefficients relating systolic BP with PbB were -6.4 +/- 11.4 and 4.5 +/- 12.9 mmHg/In(micrograms/dl) in each group, respectively, but were not statistically significant. The adjusted coefficients for diastolic BP were 1.12 +/- 3.89 and 14.3 +/- 5.69 mmHg/In(micrograms/dl) (p = 0.036), respectively. The latter relationship represents an average increment of 12 mmHg in diastolic BP over the range of observed PbBs (2.0 to 11.4 micrograms/dl) in subjects treated with beta blockers. Thus, beta blocker therapy may be less effective in reducing diastolic pressure in individuals with higher PbBs and suggests an action of lead at PbBs below current standards.\r"

The samples were analyzed for lead to assess dietary intake. The dietary intake distributed log-normally in both winter and summer. The geometric mean (GM) (geometric standard deviation [GSD]) for winter samples was 38.2 micrograms/d (1.94) for males (N = 381) and 32.8 micrograms/d (1.91) for females (N = 711). A seasonal variation was detected in females but not in males. The findings on regional differences in dietary intake were inconclusive. The levels observed were lower than most values reported in the literature. The low dietary intake levels were in agreement with the low blood lead levels found among the subjects, which may reflect of Japan's decision in 1975 to withdraw alkyl lead from automobile gasoline. No significant correlation could be established between dietary intake and blood lead levels when GMs for the study regions were compared, or when dietary intake and blood lead levels were compared in 555 nonsmoking and nondrinking females who were between 30 and 59 y of age. It is estimated that 2-4 micrograms of lead is absorbed daily from the diet (i.e., food and water), and 0.1-1 micrograms is absorbed via respiration, and that cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption may increase lead absorption.\r"

This site received ash from a single incinerator without pollution control devices from 1954-1973. Soil was sampled for 10 heavy metals, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, polychlorinated dibenzofurans, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodioxin and furan congeners, polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Soil concentrations for these substances were converted to estimates of exposure, health effects, and/or cancer risk by the application of a general exposure model and exposure/effect and exposure/risk models for specific substances. The results of soil analysis and modeling indicate that the level of lead detected on the site was considerably above the recommended levels of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and may lead to an elevated blood lead level in exposed children above that currently defining a case of lead poisoning. The potential for health effects resulting from exposure to other substances measured in the soil on this site is considered to be small, and no significant increased cancer risk is expected. Comparison of levels of various substances obtained at this site with levels obtained in fresh bottom ash in other studies suggests that these results may be applicable to exposures from other municipal incinerator bottom ash landfills.\r"

A transient impairment of lung function was noted over a work shift. Five years later, 21 subjects were still experiencing exposure to formaldehyde. A transient decrease in lung function was again found over a work shift, as evidenced by a reduction in forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75) of 0.15 l/s and an increase in closing volume (CV%) of 3.0% in nonsmokers. Significant decreases in forced expired volume in 1 s as a percent of forced vital capacity (FEV1.0/FVC) and FEF25-75 were also noted over the 5 y in nonsmokers (0.4% and 0.2 l.s/y, respectively, after correction for normal aging). After 4 wk of no exposure (holidays), FEF25-75 and forced expired vital capacity (FVC, FEV1.0) returned to normal in the smoking group. Lung function in smokers improved less during the holiday. A dose-response relationship was found between exposure to formaldehyde and decrease in lung function. Thus, industrial exposure to formaldehyde causes transient lung function impairment over a work shift, with a cumulative effect over the years. The impairment, however, can be reversed with 4 wk of no exposure.\r"

Records of patients who died or underwent cholecystectomy for gallstone-related disease at Duke University Medical Center between 1976 and 1985 were reviewed. Thirty patients died, six of whom (20%) had previous episodes of biliary pain and stone documentation. Twenty-four (80%) were asymptomatic (three with previous incidental diagnosis of cholelithiasis). Reason for admission included acute cholecystitis (nine), pancreatitis (eight), biliary pain (six), cholangitis (four), jaundice (one), and endocarditis (one). Three patients died of gallstone complications without surgical intervention; one patient had renal failure and two had septicemia. Other causes of death were: sepsis (seven patients), cardiac failure (six), pulmonary complications (four), renal failure (three), cerebrovascular accident (three), liver failure (two), pancreatitis (one), and gastrointestinal bleeding (one). During this period, 1731 cholecystectomies were performed without mortality. In this group, the patients were younger (50 +/- 8 years vs. 64 +/- 13 years, p less than 0.001), and had a lower incidence of cirrhosis (p less than 0.001) and diabetes (p less than 0.002). The sex ratio was inverted (p less than 0.001). This study demonstrates that death from gallstones is uncommon (three cases per year), as is death from their initial clinical manifestation (1.2%). The risk of death is two- and ninefold higher in patients with acute cholecystitis or acute pancreatitis. Age, cirrhosis, and diabetes are important determinants of outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies indicate that gallbladder absorption increases during the early stages of experimentally-induced cholesterol gallstone formation. The purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether pharmacologic inhibition of gallbladder ion transport and absorption reduces the incidence of experimentally-induced cholesterol gallstones. Prairie dogs were fed either a control chow or a 1.2% cholesterol-enriched chow for 15 days. One group of cholesterol-fed animals received saline via an orogastric tube; another group received amiloride, a drug known to inhibit in vitro ion transport in the prairie dog gallbladder. The incidence of gallstones in cholesterol-fed animals was reduced from 83% to 13% (p less than 0.025) when the animals were treated with amiloride; this occurred despite a cholesterol-saturation index comparable to that observed in gallstone animals. Additionally, although biliary calcium decreased in the gallbladder, hepatic bile did not in the amiloride-treated animals. These data provide further evidence that altered gallbladder absorption and increased biliary calcium are important factors in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones.\r"

Independently significant risk factors in those undergoing surgery were the serum bilirubin level, the use of preoperative ES, and the presence of medical risk factors; in patients undergoing ES, only the serum bilirubin and albumin, but not medical risk factors, were of independent significance. The major implications of this study are, first, that high-risk patients should be treated by ES without subsequent surgery, and second, that \"fit patients should be treated by surgery alone without routine preoperative ES.\r"

The clinical presentation of patients with alimentary tract duplications includes bleeding, abdominal pain, intussusception, and respiratory distress, or it may be an incidental finding on either abdominal examination or chest x-ray. A review of 96 patients with 101 duplications seen over the last 37 years is reported herein. Twenty-one duplications were confined to the thorax; three were thoracoabdominal, and 77 were abdominal. Seventy-four patients presented as infants less than 2 years of age, and 22 patients were older. Ectopic gastric mucosa was found in 21 duplications, and pancreatic tissue was found in five. Seventy-five duplications were cystic and 26 were tubular. Ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and myelography are helpful diagnostic tools. Ninety-four of the 96 patients underwent surgical management for their duplications. One duplication was found at necropsy, and one patient was asymptomatic and did not undergo operation. A single death occurred in a 2-day-old infant who had intrauterine volvulus and meconium peritonitis. Management was based on the age and condition of the patient, the location of the lesion, whether it was cystic or tubular and communicating with the true intestinal lumen, and whether it involved one or more anatomic locations. Generally, total excision was preferred, but staged approaches were sometimes necessary.\r"

In studies of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, intrapancreatic development from the head to the body or tail was observed in 14 cases of 34 cases (41.1%). Multicentricity or skip development was observed in two of 14 cases. However, by using immunostaining of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and DUPAN2, small cancer nests surrounded by dense fibrous connective tissues could be easily and accurately diagnosed, and finally, in 25 of 34 cases (73.5%), intrapancreatic continuous development from the head to body or tail was observed. The intrapancreatic development correlated with portal invasion and perineural invasion of carcinoma, hardness of body and tail, obstruction of the main pancreatic duct, and irregular pancreaticogram. The intraoperative quick immunostaining on the cryostat sections, together with HE staining, is useful to determine the intrapancreatic development of the carcinoma. The indication of total pancreatectomy or pancreatoduodenectomy for carcinoma of the head of the pancreas can be determined by these results.\r"

One hundred forty-seven patients were analyzed who had their primary resectable colorectal carcinomas resected with curative intent from 1974 to 1981. Aneuploid colorectal cancers (i.e., tumors with abnormal DNA content) tended to be less well-differentiated, to invade the serosa or extend beyond, and to have lymph node metastases rather than diploid tumors (i.e., tumors with normal DNA content). A significantly increased rate of recurrent disease was demonstrated in patients with aneuploid tumors as opposed to those with diploid tumors (46.7% vs. 4.8%, respectively [p less than 0.001]). In addition, patients with aneuploid tumors exhibited a significantly decreased disease-free and overall survival in comparison with patients with diploid colorectal carcinomas. A Cox regression analysis demonstrated that tumor DNA content was the single most important factor in predicting recurrence or death from colorectal carcinoma.\r"

  ".U": "89133599\r", 
  ".W": "Between July 1975 and July 1986, 112 patients with adenocarcinoma of the rectum were treated using preoperative irradiation followed by excisional surgery on the colorectal surgery service of Jewish Hospital at Washington University Medical Center in St. Louis. There were 68 men and 44 women in this study, with ages ranging from 19 to 94 years of age. In all cases, the rectal cancers were believed to be transmurally invasive based on initial clinical examination. Included in this group were 13 patients with poorly differentiated tumors and 51 patients with tumors fixed to surrounding tissues. Between 1975 and 1980, we used 2000 cGy preoperative irradiation followed by immediate excisional surgery to treat 22 patients. Excisional surgery for cure was divided between abdomino-perineal resection of the rectosigmoid in eleven patients, low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid in eight patients, and a low Hartmann's procedure in three patients. Five-year survival for 20 patients with potentially curable lesions (Dukes' A, B, and C), was 85%, and there was no local recurrence. Between 1980 and 1986, 90 patients were treated with 4500 cGy preoperative irradiation over a 5-week period followed by a 6-week waiting period, before excisional surgery. There were 72 patients with Dukes' A, B, and C lesions. Fifty patients underwent abdomino-perineal resection of the rectosigmoid, 33 patients underwent low anterior resection of the rectum, and seven patients underwent a low Hartmann's procedure. Five-year survival was 86%. Local recurrence was 1.8%. Tumor fixation and histologic dedifferentiation were the only factors that influenced survival. Five-year survival of patients with fixed poorly differentiated tumors was 27% as compared to 87% in patients with nonfixed well-differentiated tumors (p less than 0.0001). Tumor fixation was not a significant factor in itself. Preoperative external beam irradiation improves survival, local control, and resectability in patients with rectal cancer. This effect may be due to the treatment of the \"tangential\" margins and local lymph node metastases. Preoperative staging can be accomplished by determining fixation and differentiation of the tumor when preoperative irradiation is used.\r"

After warm ischemia, livers were harvested and underwent 90 minutes of warm, oxygenated, sanguinous perfusion on an isolated liver perfusion apparatus. Pretreatment of donor animals with 20 mg/kg intravenous (I.V.) SRI 63-441 5 minutes before induction of total hepatic ischemia resulted in significantly increased bile production, a significant decrease in transaminase release, and a higher tissue adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content when compared with ischemic nontreated controls. SOD resulted in improved bile production and decreased transaminase liberation only when present in the perfusate at the time of in vitro reperfusion. Ibuprofen did not improve postischemic hepatic function in this model. Electron microscopy revealed patchy hepatocellular vacuolization with an intact sinusoidal endothelium in all ischemic livers. However, the degree of damage was less severe in the livers from those rats pretreated with 20 mg/kg SRI 63-441. This study demonstrates that SRI 63-441 pretreatment significantly reduces hepatic warm ischemic injury, and in the present model, appears superior to two other agents that have been advanced in the treatment of ischemic injury. The use of such agents singly or in combinations have important implications as regards gaining a better understanding of the basic mechanisms in organ ischemia, and moreover, for therapeutic applications in organ ischemia and preservation.\r"

  ".U": "89133601\r", 
  ".W": "The intra- and early postoperative courses of 142 consecutive patients who underwent liver resections using vascular occlusions to reduce bleeding were reviewed. In 127 patients, the remnant liver parenchyma was normal, and 15 patients had liver cirrhosis. Eighty-five patients underwent major liver resections: right, extended right, or left lobectomies. Portal triad clamping (PTC) was used alone in 107 cases. Complete hepatic vascular exclusion (HVE) combining PTC and occlusion of the inferior vena cava below and above the liver was used for 35 major liver resections. These 35 patients had large or posterior liver tumors, and HVE was used to reduce the risks of massive bleeding or air embolism caused by an accidental tear of the vena cava or a hepatic vein. Duration of normothermic liver ischemia was 32.3 +/- 1.2 minutes (mean +/- SEM) and ranged from 8 to 90 minutes. Amount of blood transfusion was 5.5 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SEM) units of packed red blood cells. There were eight operative deaths (5.6%). Overall, postoperative complications occurred in 46 patients (32%). The patients who experienced complications after surgery had received more blood transfusion than those with an uneventful postoperative course (p less than 0.001). The length of postoperative hospital stay was also correlated with the amount of blood transfused during surgery (p less than 0.001). On the other hand, there was no correlation between the durations of liver ischemia of up to 90 minutes and the lengths of postoperative hospital stay. The longest periods of ischemia were not associated with increased rates of postoperative complications, liver failures, or deaths. There was no difference in mortality or morbidity after major liver resections performed with the use of HVE as compared with major liver resections carried out with PTC alone, although the lesions were larger in the former group. It is concluded that the main priority during liver resections is to reduce operative bleeding. Vascular occlusions aim at achieving this goal and can be extended safely for up to 60 minutes.\r"

This study examines the pulmonary sequelae of lower torso ischemia in 20 consecutive patients aged 63 +/- 5 years (mean +/- SEM) who underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. After 30 minutes of aortic cross-clamping, plasma TxB2 levels had risen from 77 +/- 26 pg/ml to 359 +/- 165 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) and was temporally related to increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) from 18 +/- 1 to 23 +/- 3 mmHg (p less than 0.01), as well as to increases in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) from 0.07 +/- 0.02 to 0.12 +/- 0.02 mmHg sec/ml (p less than 0.01). Each time that the aortic clamp was repositioned and with final declamping, after 83 +/- 10 minutes, there were further increases in MPAP to a peak of 32 +/- 2 mmHg (p less than 0.01) and in PVR to 0.26 +/- 0.030 mmHg sec/ml (p less than 0.01), corresponding to a plasma TxB2 level of 406 +/- 177 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). MPAP and PVR returned to baseline values within 30 minutes of declamping. Ten minutes after removal of the aortic clamp, platelet levels had fallen from 180 +/- 41 to 97 +/- 17 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.01) and WBC levels from 8900 +/- 1100 to 4700 +/- 400/mm3 (p less than 0.01). Both platelets and WBC returned towards normal levels, but at 24 hours, while WBC was elevated at 13000 +/- 900/mm3 (p less than 0.01), platelets were 44% of baseline at 135 +/- 14 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.01). Four to 8 hours after surgery, pulmonary dysfunction was manifest by increases in physiologic shunt from 9 +/- 2% to 16 +/- 2% (p less than 0.01), and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) from 23 +/- 2 to 33 +/- 2 cmH2O (p less than 0.01). Chest radiography demonstrated interstitial pulmonary edema in all patients, whereas pulmonary artery wedge pressure was 12 +/- 2 mmHg, excluding the possibility of left ventricular failure. After 24 hours, pulmonary edema had resolved, and the PIP and PaO2 had both returned to baseline. These data indicate that reperfusion of the ischemic lower torso leads to the synthesis of TxA2, an event temporally related to pulmonary hypertension and transient leukopenia with subsequent pulmonary microvascular injury manifest by interstitial edema.\r"

Clinical characteristics reported to influence survival have included age and sex of the patient, the therapy used, location of the primary tumor, and stage at initial presentation. However, such variables are highly correlated, and previous reports have lacked sufficient statistical analysis to assess the independent influence of these competing variables on survival. To better define the principal determinants of survival, we used a Cox multivariate regression analysis of 542 patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated exclusively at our institution from 1962 to 1976. All patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years after diagnosis, with 98% complete follow-up achieved. Stage at initial presentation was the single-most important factor influencing survival for all tumor locations (p less than 0.0001). Advanced age (p = 0.001) and location of the primary tumor in the tonsillar area (p = 0.01) were also independently associated with an inferior survival. The type of therapy used and sex of the patient did not significantly influence survival after controlling for stage. These data emphasize the need for early diagnosis and treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and underscore the limitations of current therapeutic approaches. Future investigations should incorporate multivariate statistical techniques whenever possible, and additional efforts must be directed at basic research into the biology and immunologic characteristics of these tumors in an attempt to identify innovative therapeutic modalities.\r"

A new classification system (CHAT) has been designed to deal with these problems, including the current clinical presentation, historical clinical episodes, the site and pathologic type of arterial disease, and information regarding abnormalities of the brain. Using this system, a retrospective review of 480 consecutive carotid endarterectomies is presented, demonstrating the advantages of the CHAT classification. Data include a significant difference in the probability of survival after carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis in patients with prior symptoms on the opposite side, as well as a significant difference in the probability of stroke-free survival between patients with amaurosis fugax and those with prior carotid cortical symptoms (TIAs) as the presenting clinical condition. The CHAT classification is suggested as a significant advance in the reporting of all surgical cerebrovascular disease experience, and has particular implications for the current randomized trials between medical and surgical therapy for carotid artery disease.\r"

  ".W": "Since 1971, 151 nonpalpable breast cancers (100 invasive carcinomas, 39 in situ ductal carcinomas, and twelve lobular carcinomas in situ) have been diagnosed and treated at the St. Radboud University Hospital. Of the 100 clinically occult invasive carcinomas, 53 had pathologic diameters of more than 10 mm, 29 were of sizes between 6 and 10 mm, and 18 were tumors of 5 mm or less. Residual tumor outside the \"excisional\" biopsy cavity was encountered in 76 of the 118 mastectomy specimens (64.4%) fully capable of evaluation. Invasive residual tumor would have been left behind in 34 of 86 mastectomy specimens (39.5%). Of 27 axillas studied, no patient with in situ carcinoma had evidence of axillary lymph node metastases. Invasive carcinoma, however, showed axillary lymph node involvement in 7.7% of mastectomy specimens when the size of the primary tumor was not more than 5 mm, in 12.5% when the size was between 6 and 10 mm, and in 29.5% when the primary tumor was more than 10 mm in diameter. The 10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) of patients with clinically occult invasive carcinomas greater than 10 mm in size was 71.9% and differed significantly from the 90.9% for patients with the invasive tumors less than or equal to 5 mm, as well as from the 100% RFS of patients with invasive tumors of between 6 and 10 mm and noninvasive tumors. Although the 10-year RFS was 92.6% for the patients with negative axillary nodes and 80.0% for the patients with positive axillary nodes, this difference did not reach statistical significance. However, the disease-specific overall survival after 10 years was significantly different between node-negative patients (96.4%) and node-positive patients (78.8%). Multivariate analysis disclosed that the relationship between size of the primary tumor and RFS was independent of the presence of axillary lymph node metastases. In conclusion, the validity of the concept of minimal breast cancer has been re-enforced. However, the results of this study suggest that the upper limit of the original definition of minimal breast cancer is too narrow and should be extended, so that, apart from the noninvasive tumors--regardless of their size--all invasive tumors having a maximum diameter less than or equal to 10 mm should be regarded as minimal breast cancers.\r"

  ".W": "Fifty-one patients with urgent hypertension were treated in the emergency department with either oral nifedipine or oral clonidine in a randomized double-blind prospective study. Nifedipine was administered as a single dose of 20 mg. Clonidine was administered as an initial dose of 0.1 mg with hourly doses of 0.1 mg. Nifedipine was successful in reducing diastolic blood pressure in 83% of the patients within 45 minutes and in 96% of the patients within two hours, with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 47 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 29 mm Hg. Thirty percent of those who initially responded to nifedipine experienced a subsequent increase in diastolic blood pressure to pretreatment levels within three hours. Clonidine was successful in reducing diastolic blood pressure in 79% of the patients within four hours, with a mean reduction in systolic blood pressure of 51 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure of 30 mm Hg. Our results indicate that both nifedipine and clonidine are safe and effective in the treatment of urgent hypertension. Nifedipine had a much more rapid onset of action with a greater initial success rate, and it was free from the sedative side effects of clonidine. We believe that either nifedipine or clonidine may be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of urgent hypertension.\r"

Six years after the baseline examination, 9.5% of 996 insulin-taking people who were younger than age 30 years when their diabetes was diagnosed (younger onset) had died. Of 1370 people whose diabetes was diagnosed after age 30 years (older onset), 35.3% had died. After adjusting for age and sex, longer duration of diabetes, presence of proteinuria, a history of cardiovascular disease, higher blood pressure, diuretic use, a history of smoking, poorer visual acuity, and more severe retinopathy were significantly associated with decreased survival in both groups. Glaucoma was associated with decreased survival in the younger onset group and cataract in the older onset group. These findings suggest that some ocular complications are important risk indicators for death. Their presence in diabetic patients suggests the need for frequent examinations to detect systemic complications and to intervene to minimize their effect.\r"

Each underwent measurement of seated and standing blood pressure and heart rate before and after a standard breakfast and before and after a volume of water (control). Eight young persons underwent the measurements before and after the meal. The elderly but not the young showed a significant fall in systolic and diastolic pressures after the meal, with heart rate increases in some subjects clearly inadequate for the decline in systemic pressure. No symptoms were seen. But postprandial decrease in blood pressure may in some less robust elderly persons be a factor in syncope and falls. This change may also confuse the monitoring of antihypertensive treatment in older outpatients.\r"

Histoplasma capsulatum antigen was detected in the CSF of five patients. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures were positive for H capsulatum in three of these five patients. Antibodies to H capsulatum were found in nine of the 13 CSF specimens tested. The radioimmunoassay for Histoplasma antigen was also positive in the CSF in one of 11 patients with coccidioidal meningitis but not in 17 patients with cryptococcal meningitis.

To provide practical information about the problem as a whole, we studied febrile illnesses arising after admission (nosocomial febrile illnesses [NFls]) in 123 inpatients of an internal medicine service who had been afebrile for the preceding week. We compared them with 123 randomly selected patients without NFl. Causes of NFl included infections in 83 cases; noninfectious, inflammatory states in 15; malignancy in 12; ischemia in eight; and procedures in three. Evidence for the cause of the NFl was present at onset in at least 110 of the 123 patients. Despite this, antimicrobial agents were administered to 23 (58%) of 40 patients without infections. Thirty-four patients with NFl died; the NFl contributed to death in 26. In contrast, only eight comparison patients died. \"Do not resuscitate\" status was present in 32 patients with NFl compared with only 12 comparison patients, and 19 (59%) of the former died. The data from this study provide a comprehensive description of NFl arising in hospitalized internal medicine patients, indicate that the occurrence of a new febrile illness signifies a poor prognosis, and provide a rational basis for management.\r"

We attempted to determine if a reduction in mortality in a subgroup of these patients admitted directly to the critical care units could be identified. A new method using the scientific principles of a randomized trial applied to the case-control design was employed. All 1905 patients admitted to the medical service over a three-month period were prospectively evaluated for illness severity and stability. Patients who would not have been eligible for a randomized clinical trial were excluded. Based on the prospective evaluations, four prognostically distinct subgroups of patients were formed. An odds ratio for each of the prognostic groups was calculated, a ratio of greater than 1 indicating a protective effect of direct critical care admission. Only one subgroup of patients, the unstable moderately ill, had an odds ratio greater than 1 (13.3). These results, in association with the results of our previous study, suggest that at the time of admission to the hospital, direct admission to the critical care unit reduced mortality among the unstable moderately ill subgroup of patients.\r"

To determine the attitudes and practices of internists concerning smoking cessation and selected preventive medical practices, we surveyed a random sample of internists in private practice and in a large health maintenance organization (Kaiser-Permanente Medical Group) in the San Francisco Bay area. Overall, internists consider counseling about smoking to be at least as worthwhile as many other practices, such as screening for breast cancer, and more worthwhile than periodic physical examinations. Despite these beliefs, 57% to 65% of internists reported that they spend two minutes or less counseling smokers during new patient visits. Many internists never use recommended strategies for counseling about smoking: 33% to 44% never help patients plan dates to quit, 68% to 75% never make follow-up appointments with patients primarily about smoking, and 27% to 48% never give smokers self-help pamphlets about quitting. Although they believe that counseling about smoking is worthwhile, internists are not doing as much as they could to help their patients quit.\r"

To assess the feasibility and safety of early transfer, a prospective analysis of 57 patients who were transported by ground ambulance or helicopter to the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, for acute intervention during the early hours of myocardial infarction was conducted. Before transport, the majority (46 [81%]) of patients were having chest discomfort, 13 (23%) were hypotensive, and 12 (21%) were electrically unstable (defined as high-grade ventricular ectopia or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia). During transport, the majority (41 [72%]) continued to have some chest discomfort; however, only two (4%) remained hypotensive. Although five patients (9%) were electrically unstable during transport, the instability was considered noncritical. The distance traveled or the mode of transportation did not adversely impact on these clinical complications. All patients survived transport, and 53 patients (93%) were eventually discharged from the receiving hospital.\r"

Peripheral neuropathy was the presenting symptom in 11 patients, and it was a later symptom or an incidental physical examination finding at the time of amyloid workup in 40 additional patients. The median duration of time from first symptom to the diagnosis of primary amyloidosis was longer in those whose first symptom was neuropathy (48 months vs 12 months). In addition, survival time after diagnosis for these patients was significantly longer (at least 35 months vs 16 months). Peripheral neuropathy is not an uncommon symptom of primary amyloidosis and may mark the onset of the disease process years before infiltration of vital structures of the heart, kidneys or gastrointestinal tract leads to failure and a subsequent downhill course. Appreciating amyloid disease at this early stage may widen the potential therapeutic window.\r"

No significant hemodynamic changes occurred in the patients who fasted. That the left ventricular ejection fraction was increased postprandially (3% to 4%) indicated that food intake had positive inotropic as well as chronotropic effects on the ischemic heart, even in heart failure. Afterload reduction and increased sympathetic nervous activity contribute to the changes, but the primary mechanism may be a change in resistance and blood flow in the intestinal vascular bed involved in digestion.\r"

This has led to its proposed use as a screen for thyroid disease. However, s-TSH may be suppressed in conditions other than thyrotoxicosis. We retrospectively reviewed s-TSH measurements made in a large heterogeneous population to determine in which settings a suppressed value could potentially lead to misdiagnosis. We found that a suppressed s-TSH level was useful in making the diagnosis of autonomous thyroid function and in the assessment of thyroid hormone replacement therapy in patients with primary, but not central, hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism caused by either intrinsic thyroid disease or thyroid hormone administration accounted for 83% (111/134) of suppressed values; however, central hypothyroidism, nonthyroidal illness, acute psychiatric illness, or the administration of medication was responsible for this finding in 17% (23/134). While a suppressed s-TSH level is generally excellent in the diagnosis of pituitary suppression by thyroid hormone, in specific clinical settings, a suppressed s-TSH level may be seen in the absence of thyroid hormone excess. The limitations of its use as a first-line screen in those conditions must be recognized.\r"

Although a \"low probability\" interpretation does not exclude the diagnosis of PE, it significantly reduces the likelihood. We retrospectively analyzed up to one year of follow-up in 90 patients who were clinically suspected of having PE, but in whom V/Q scintigraphy implied a low probability of PE. None of the 90 patients demonstrated clinical evidence of PE subsequent to the V/Q scan.

We therefore analyzed data from a national survey of randomly selected general practitioners, internists, and cardiologists to assess their management of outpatients with New York Heart Association class II congestive heart failure. Most of the 2704 respondents (90%) scheduled office visits between two and four months apart. Body weight, serum electrolytes, and chest roentgenograms were followed regularly by 98% or more of respondents, at median intervals of one to two months, three to five months, and 12 to 17 months, respectively. Serum digoxin levels in patients taking digoxin were followed by 90% of respondents at a median interval of 12 months. Echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, and exercise testing were used by fewer respondents (81%, 61%, and 61%, respectively), each at a median interval of 18 months or longer. Cardiologists were significantly more likely to follow patients using either echocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography, or exercise testing. The estimated yearly cost of following a class II congestive heart failure outpatient varied nearly fourfold from the lowest quartile of physicians ($303) to the highest ($1167). Cardiologists were disproportionately represented among the high-cost users. In addition, physicians who were younger or who practiced in an urban setting were significantly more likely to be high-cost users. Thus, simple laboratory tests were used most frequently to follow patients with heart failure, but differences in use of more expensive tests led to large differences in cost. Test use for similar patients is affected by characteristics of both the physician and practice setting.\r"

  ".W": "Concurrent charge feedback has gained widespread acceptance as a method of minimizing hospitals' losses under the Medicare prospective payment system despite the fact that its effect on patient outcomes, physician behavior, or charges has not been studied in depth. In a controlled trial on two medical wards in an academic medical center, the effect of daily charge feedback on charges was studied. Sixty-eight house staff and 16 teaching attending physicians participated during a 35-week period, taking care of 1057 eligible patients. No significant differences in charges were seen when all patients were included. Since 45% of patients had planned protocol admissions (diagnostic workups or protocol treatment) on which the house staff had little change to impact, a subgroup analysis was performed, excluding these patients. In the remaining patients, a highly significant reduction in mean total charges (17%), length of stay (18%), room charges (18%), and diagnostic testing (20%) was found. In-hospital mortality and preventable readmission within 30 days were similar on the two wards. It was concluded that charge feedback alone is effective in a teaching hospital for decreasing charges.\r"

Autonomic function was also assessed in these patients with Valsalva's maneuver and plasma catecholamine determinations. Echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography in the group with ESRD revealed no abnormalities of LV wall motion or ejection fraction. During graded exercise, patients with ESRD achieved 85% of age-predicted heart rate, and no differences in exercise tolerance or LV function were observed. Valsalva's response was abnormal in patients with ESRD, and post exercise the norepinephrine level was markedly increased (12.5 +/- 1.43 vs 8.28 +/- 0.82 nmol/L). Our results fail to indicate an independent adverse effect of ESRD on LV function.\r"

Such urethral catheterization is associated with polymicrobial bacteriuria, catheter obstruction, fever, bacteremia, urinary tract stones, and death. Periodic catheter irrigation is a common but untested management procedure intended to prevent catheter obstruction, fevers, and/or bacteremia. To evaluate this technique, we performed a randomized crossover trial comparing ten weeks of once-daily normal saline irrigation with ten weeks of no irrigation in 32 long-term catheterized women. The incidence of catheter obstructions and febrile episodes and the prevalence and species of bacteriuria were similar whether examined as completed crossover patients (N = 23) or as partially completed trials (N = 9). Once-daily irrigation with normal saline of long-term urethral catheters is a time-consuming and costly procedure that is unlikely to have an impact on the morbidity associated with such catheters.\r"

Retrospective estimation of the concentration of SAA protein, a serum precursor of AA amyloid, before and after surgical removal of the myxoma, showed that the SAA protein had disappeared after the operation. A common manifestation of myxoma is the development of a severe inflammatory syndrome that sometimes simulates rheumatic fever or bacterial endocarditis. However, to our knowledge, it has never been described in association with amyloidosis. We suggest that atrial myxoma should be added the list of neoplastic and inflammatory diseases predisposing to AA amyloidosis.\r"

Two thirds of all patients converted to sinus rhythm (SR) within a seven-day in-hospital treatment. The most frequent causes associated with AF were atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 55%; rheumatic heart disease, 22.8%; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 2.8%; Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome, 2.6%; and thyrotoxicosis, 2.6%. There was a relatively large group of idiopathic AF (4.5%). Best convertors to SR were patients with idiopathic AF (93.9%), then patients with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome (88.8%), followed by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (71.6%), and thyrotoxicosis (63.2%). Patients with rheumatic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had the lowest percentage of successful conversion to SR--46% and 55%, respectively. We conclude that there are differences regarding gender, age, and possible conversion of AF to SR according to the different causes of AF.\r"

Electron microscopy revealed the characteristic cytoplasmic whorled filamentous inclusions in all tumors. An epithelial phenotype (presence of cytoplasmic tonofilaments) was observed in two tumors (one renal and one extrarenal); and a focal primitive neural phenotype (cytoplasmic processes with neurosecretory granules), in a renal rhabdoid tumor. Strands of basal lamina were seen in two renal and one extrarenal rhabdoid tumors. Evaluation of basal lamina was more difficult in the third renal rhabdoid tumor, in which tissue preservation was not optimal. Primitive attachments were present in all rhabdoid tumors. Immunocytochemical staining supported a diverse phenotype, ranging from epithelial and/or mesenchymal to myogenous and/or neuroectodermal. Simultaneous expression of several of the studied antigenic determinants by the same tumor was noted. The findings suggest that both renal and extrarenal rhabdoid tumors express a diverse morphological and immunocytochemical phenotype.\r"

Both markers, when present in HCCs, tended to be spotty. Fibrolamellar carcinomas and normal livers did not react with either Le(x) or Le(y) antigens; however, Le(y) antigen was observed occasionally in bile duct epithelial and ductular cells. In conclusion, inappropriate tissue distribution of Le(y) blood-group antigens was observed in CCs and, much less frequently, in HCCs.

Endocrine cells were sparse but found rather constantly in normal infant livers as well as in adult livers. Almost all endocrine cells were of argyrophil cells or somatostatin-containing cells, and they were usually found in the extramural peribiliary glands in normal livers. On the other hand, in hepatolithiasis in which there were marked proliferation of the peribiliary glands and hyperplasia of surface-lining epithelia, many kinds of endocrine cells were seen in the extramural and intramural peribiliary glands, as well as in the lining epithelial layer. Furthermore, these endocrine cells were hyperplastic in the affected intrahepatic bile duct in two patients with hepatolithiasis. These data suggested that argyrophil cells and somatostatin-containing cells are physiologically present in the intrahepatic biliary tree, and many kinds of other endocrine cells newly appear and even proliferate in hepatolithiasis. These findings imply the participation of reported action of these hormones on bile flow in normal livers and hepatolithiasis.\r"

Many authors report their phenotypic heterogeneity, ranging from apparently common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen-positive to monoblastic leukemia, through \"promiscuous\" phenotype. We studied in vitro phenotypic modulation of three typical cases after induction by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate. The initial phenotype was different in each case, but all of them exhibited changes in morphologic shape, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype; common features appeared after induction by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate, including esterase activity, expression of CD-9, CD-15, and CD-18 surface antigens, and monocyte/macrophage morphology. In all cases a B-associated surface antigen, CD-19, persisted. During clinical evolution, some previously reported cases have shown a karyotypic and phenotypic transformation. In one of our cases this phenomenon correlated with in vitro phenotypic modulation of initial blast population. Furthermore, clinical relapses and in vitro modulation always seem to evolve toward a more \"mature\" phenotype. Those results support the \"promiscuous lineage\" hypothesis, and point out the usefulness of in vitro studies to express the myeloid potential of this category of acute leukemia, which can be regarded as a model of early hematopoietic differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "This article describes the ultrastructural study of skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from five patients following envenomization by tropical rattlesnake (Crotalus durissus terrificus). All the patients were bitten in the leg and the biopsy specimens were obtained from the contralateral gastrocnemius muscle in the middle of the lower leg. A wide spectrum of detailed ultrastructural changes involving muscle fibers and microvasculature was demonstrated. Essentially, such lesions included widespread necrotic myofibers intermixed with intact fibers, accompanied by changes in the endothelial lining of the intramuscular blood capillaries and small arterial vessels, reducing their lumens. Since these alterations were observed in biopsy specimens from the limb contralateral to the site of the bite, they clearly demonstrate the systemic myonecrotic action of the venom of a tropical rattlesnake. On the basis of these data, the mechanism of venom-induced myopathy is described. It is postulated that the pathogenesis of systemic myonecrosis due to poisoning by C durissus terrificus is a complex one, probably due to direct damage to cells by the myotoxins of the venom, as well as indirect effects due to ischemia.\r"

From these tables, certain conclusions can be drawn. Unrelated donors who do not know their blood type are an inefficient source of directed donors. Rh-negative patients are unlikely to obtain enough directed-donor units from either related or unrelated donors with confidence unless these donors known their blood type. In general, siblings, parents, and offspring are the most efficient directed donors from the standpoint of compatibility. Cousins, uncles, aunts, nieces, and nephews are not much more likely to be compatible than unrelated donors are. It is easier to obtain suitable directed-donor units among Hispanics than among whites, blacks, or Asians, due to their skewed blood group frequencies. In general, using O-negative directed donors for Rh-positive recipients does not significantly increase the likelihood of finding suitable donors.\r"

  ".W": "Hemolysis can cause falsely elevated creatine kinase (CK) values when spectrophotometric methods of measurement are used. This apparent increase in CK is due to the red blood cell enzyme adenylate kinase. In an attempt to reduce this interference, most commercial CK kits employ adenosine monophosphate and/or diadenosine pentaphosphate as adenylate kinase inhibitors. To determine whether hemolyzed specimens should be accepted for testing, we measured the CK values of 26 serum samples, each with six different concentrations of added hemolysate. The results showed that hemolysis had an additive effect on CK, with an average increase in CK of approximately 10 U/L for every 1 g/L of hemoglobin. In most settings, this increase is not clinically significant. In the case of massive hemolysis, the hemoglobin concentration of the serum can be measured to correct the apparent CK value. The exclusion of hemolyzed specimens is unnecessary.\r"

All the lectins but Ulex europaeus agglutinin I, peanut agglutinin, and Helix pomatia agglutinin were bound to thyroid parenchymal cells, colloid and stromal cells, but none uniquely to thyroid parenchymal cells. Helix pomatia agglutinin binding was present in stromal cells but not in parenchymal cells. Ulex europaeus agglutinin I binding to parenchymal cells was weakly positive only in five cases of papillary carcinoma. The binding in adenomatoid and neoplastic cells and their colloid was stronger than in adjacent normal thyroid tissue in all cases examined. Wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A binding was most intense among the lectins examined. In papillary carcinoma, lectin binding was observed mostly in the apical cytoplasm of carcinoma cells, whereas a diffuse surface binding pattern was predominant in follicular adenoma and carcinoma, adenomatoid nodules and normal thyroid gland. No consistent differences in lectin binding were found between follicular adenoma and carcinoma, or between adenomatoid nodules and follicular neoplasia.\r"

Fifty healthy women volunteers, aged 40 to 65 years (mean = 56 years), participated in a back exercise program. Subjects were screened to exclude those with diseases or treatment programs that could affect muscle strength. Seventeen subjects participated in a conventional back strengthening program, consisting mainly of antigravity upper back extension exercises in the prone position. Thirty-three control subjects continued to perform their usual athletic and daily physical activities. The control group were postmenopausal women who had volunteered to participate in a study of the effect of back strengthening exercises on bone mineral density. Subjects were blindly assigned to the control group without any selection procedures. We used this group as the control for this study because two studies were performed concurrently, and it seemed unnecessary to have two control groups. All subjects were instructed in proper posture principles. Physical activity and back extensor strength were evaluated every four to six weeks for three months. Milestones were completed by 16 subjects in the exercise group and 31 control subjects. The strength of the back extensors was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in the exercise group. This study indicates that the back extensors can be strengthened with conventional back extension exercise.\r"

Patients were then randomly assigned either to a group that received immediate postoperative physical therapy or to one that did not. Results represent the combination of data from a pilot study and this subsequent study following appropriate statistical analysis. Sixty-four women in the treatment group showed a statistically significant increase in shoulder range of motion in both abduction and flexion as compared to 51 women who received no physical therapy. The treated group also had fewer problems with five of the six upper extremity functional tasks that were assessed. There were no significant differences between the groups for length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, or upper extremity edema. The authors conclude that early physical therapy intervention makes a significant contribution to return to normal function without increasing the incidence of postoperative complications or prolonging hospital stay.\r"

With a thermocouple inserted into a 20-gauge needle, the temperature elevations in the tendon of the extensor muscles originating at the lateral epicondyle were measured. It was found that the temperatures of the tendons rose into the therapeutic range when the ultrasound was applied directly to the skin surface, but not when treatment was given under water. It is therefore preferable to give ultrasound treatments with the applicator in direct contact with the subject rather than in an immersion bath with tap water as the coupling agent.\r"

Twenty-one patients have received this form of treatment, and the functional status of eight has been tracked by the Patient Evaluation Conference System (PECS) for at least six months. In most cases, spasticity, performance of bowel and bladder programs, and performance of ADL improved after delivery of intrathecal baclofen. The improvements appear to be due to the decrease in hypertonicity and the increased ease of movement (passive or active) in affected extremities. Intrathecal baclofen should be considered as a treatment method in patients with severe spasticity of spinal origin.\r"

Retrospective analysis of weekly aggregate OGMS scores indicated that a decline in performance of 0.23 or greater is clinically significant. Over a one-year period, 27 patients demonstrated significant decrements in OGMS performance, and in 93% of these instances, the decrease was attributable to a medical problem. Adverse effects of medication was the most common etiology of decreased performance (n = 13). Overwhelmingly, the decline in the OGMS score was the first indication of impaired cognition. This monitoring device is therefore useful as an indicator during PTA of declining cognitive function, warranting further medical evaluation.\r"

About a third of dancers fitted with viscoelastic insoles and a tenth of placebo insert wearers found that the insoles made their shoes too tight to be comfortable.

Proximal volar forearm pain radiation is experienced by patients with chronic CTS during this maneuver. This investigation shows that significant distal excursion of the median nerve occurs with hyperextension of the index finger and to a greater degree than with hyperextension of the adjacent digits. Pain experienced during the TMNST appears to be vascular in origin and its severity is directly related to the duration of testing.

  ".W": "Spasticity, a common problem in upper motor neuron lesions, frequently results in uncontrolled involuntary motion that interferes with function. A quantifiable method related to the mechanical output of the muscle is needed to test and improve therapeutic intervention. A sinusoidal displacement of 5 degrees was used to measure elastic and viscous stiffness around the ankle at frequencies from 3 to 12Hz. To isolate viscoelastic response, the influences of inertia and equipment drag were eliminated. Test-retest correlation values were 0.953 for elastic and 0.992 for viscous stiffness. The elastic stiffness in 13 spastic subjects under nerve block was significantly higher than that of 13 healthy subjects (p less than or equal to 0.05), indicating early changes associated with contracture. Elastic and viscous response is expressed by the total stiffness vector containing both components, the Nyquist diagram. This diagram's pathlength from 3 to 12Hz was calculated and showed high test-retest reliability in healthy subjects. The median pathlength value for the spastic group was 98 Newton-meters/radian (N-m/rad) and, for the normal group, 24N-m/rad, a statistically significant difference (p less than or equal to 0.0001). A mathematical model of the spastic response shows that the Nyquist diagram's pathlength relates to reflex loop gain and is independent of the shift in passive properties. The model predicts a shift in passive properties during spastic responses relative to responses measured during nerve block. Thus, subtraction of passive responses measured during nerve block may not isolate the remaining reflex response, but the pathlength measure relating to the reflex response gain was unaffected, allowing evaluation of therapeutic intervention effectiveness.\r"

The use of suction cup surface electrodes in place of the taped metal disc surface electrodes increases patient and operator safety and enhances patient comfort and operator efficiency. A two-channel EMG, with a single active needle and two reference electrodes, was done on patients routinely referred for electromyographic studies. The motor units were stored and compared. Similarly, baseline noise was stored and compared. This study shows that no distortion of motor unit potentials in typically measured parameters, nor alteration in baseline \"noise\" occurs when using the suction cup electrode in place of the taped metal discs. The safer, more comfortable suction cup surface electrodes do not distort the motor unit potentials that electromyographers are accustomed to interpreting.\r"

Slow-to-recover patients are those who remain at Rancho levels II and III for extended periods of time and are candidates for sensory stimulation programs. Although sensory stimulation is considered beneficial, its utility has not been documented, partly because of the absence of formal measurement tools. The WNSSP consists of 32 items which assess patients' arousal/attention, expressive communication, and response to auditory, visual, tactile, and olfactory stimulation. It was administered to 57 patients with a mean age of 29 years at a mean time of eight months after injury. Statistical analyses indicate the WNSSP to be a reliable, valid measure of cognitive function. WNSSP means differ at each Rancho level, and ranges of scores at each level are sufficiently broad to demonstrate improvement within as well as across cognitive levels. Subjects who later improved performed significantly better on initial testing than did those who did not improve, suggesting prognostic ability of the WNSSP. Our data support other investigations which emphasize that some slow-to-recover patients experience significant improvement. The WNSSP can be a useful tool for studying the recovery process and evaluating treatment programs for slow-to-recover patients.\r"

Heart rate was monitored by telemetry. Expired gas samples were collected in Douglas bags. Oxygen and CO2 concentrations were determined by mass spectrometry and expired gas volumes by a wet gas meter. Pulmonary ventilation, O2 consumption, and CO2 production were calculated from expired gas samples. Laboratory studies were conducted on eight men with paraplegia and ten untrained, healthy, able-bodied men. The same persons were tested on the gamefield while propelling a wheelchair over the power ramp, the climber, and doing chin-ups. Age and weight were 32 +/- 4yrs vs 31 +/- 6yrs and 79.6kg vs 79.0kg, respectively, for paraplegic and healthy men. Paraplegic men had average heart rates of 133 +/- 11bpm, 133 +/- 19bpm, and 135 +/- 21bpm, respectively, for the power ramp, climber, and chin-ups. Heart rate values for able-bodied men were 136 +/- 26bpm, 139 +/- 24bpm, and 136 +/- 26bpm, respectively, for the same three exercises. The paraplegic men's VO2 measurements were 13.2 +/- 2.2, 11.5 +/- 2.8, and 6.4 +/- 2.9ml/min/kg, respectively, for the power ramp, climber, and chin-ups. The able-bodied men's VO2 measurements were 15.8 +/- 2.8, 15.4 +/- 3.6, and 9.2 +/- 2.8 ml/min/kg for the same exercises. Patients with paraplegia seemed to outperform able-bodied men in all events. Gamefield exercises appeared to tax the cardiorespiratory system at a level comparable to that usually prescribed for training purposes.\r"

Degenerative changes of the lumbar spine and knee joints have been linked to prolonged asymmetric loading, which may be accentuated when force magnitudes are high, as in running. This study evaluated the extent and location of kinematic and kinetic asymmetries relative to the foot component worn. The running patterns of six children with unilateral below-knee amputations were evaluated on two occasions: first, while wearing the solid ankle-cushioned heel (SACH) component, and second, wearing the single-axis (SA) component. Cinematographic and forceplate data yielded bilateral temporal data, vertical ground reaction forces, joint angular trajectories, and moments. Results indicated that the SACH and SA components performed almost identically, despite the greater excursion allowed by the SA foot. Slower step speed on the affected side was related to significantly lower vertical ground reaction forces (p less than .01). The ankle angular displacement and moment curves revealed the incapacity of either component to stimulate natural foot-ankle function, with resulting significant interlimb asymmetries. The ipsilateral knee displayed marked reduction of the initial flexor wave, paired with a reduced extensor moment. Compensations predominated ipsilaterally, as evidenced by the similarity of the contralateral patterns to those of an able-bodied runner, except for a decreased hip flexor moment before toe-off. This study showed that interlimb asymmetries were attributable to the inadequacies of both components.\r"

The relationship between his verbal (reading and writing), manual, and pantomimic performances is examined in two ways. First, a comparison of the three modes of communication shows whether or not these systems can be dissociated by pathology. Second, the extent to which one mode recovers more fully than the others indicates whether the three modes function independently. Results of testing conducted at six weeks and at 18 months postonset revealed that this individual's manual, verbal, and pantomimic communication skills were all similarly impaired as a result of his CVA. Furthermore, at 18 months no single mode had recovered more rapidly or to a greater extent than any other. These results support the notion that aphasia in the deaf and hearing population is similar, and is consistent with the view that aphasia is the result of a central symbolic/cognitive process which manifests itself in parallel dysfunctions of verbal, manual, and pantomimic communication.\r"

The breast appearance was scored as \"excellent,\" \"good,\" \"fair,\" or \"poor\". Median follow-up was 76 months (range, 37 to 186 months). Cosmetic results were generally excellent or good. The percents of excellent, good, fair, and poor results at three years were 65%, 25%, 7%, and 3%, respectively. Patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely than those receiving chemotherapy to have excellent scores at five years (71% vs 40%). Tumor size also influenced cosmetic outcome: 73% of patients with T1 tumors vs 55% with T2 tumors had excellent scores at five years. Our results were stable over time: of 36 patients assessable at seven years whose cosmetic scores were good or excellent at three years, 34 (94%) continued to have good or excellent scores, and only two (5%) deteriorated to fair. We conclude that the cosmetic results achieved with CS and RT are good to excellent in approximately 90% of patients and that these results remain stable for at least seven years.\r"

Following resection of the tumor, 21 patients had reconstruction using mesh or a mesh \"sandwich.\" There were no operative deaths and no respirator need. Twenty patients are alive from five to 120 months, with a median of 50 months. One of 35 patients had chest wall recurrence.

In the first study, 232 patients with stage B2 disease were operated on and survival was unaffected by therapy. In the stage B2 group, survival was 78% at five years, and is estimated to be 64% ten years after surgery. A second study, begun in 1979, compared survival and recurrence data on patients who underwent surgical resection and were treated postoperatively with fluorouracil and hepatic irradiation vs those who were observed. Hematologic toxicity of the regimen and accumulation of data from the first study caused the termination of randomization of patients with stage B2 disease with continued registration to observation only. One hundred twenty-four untreated patients with stage B2 carcinoma had a five-year survival rate of 77%, confirming the relatively high survival of this group of patients who are treated with surgery alone. Our patients' five-year survival of 78% corresponds favorably to the 87% survival rate anticipated in an age-, sex-, and race-matched cohort of Americans not specifically diagnosed as having cancer. Adjuvant trials, in seeking improved survival, should recognize that our review of 356 patients implies a considerably higher-than-anticipated five-year survival for the patient with stage B2 disease who undergoes surgical resection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The abilities of colorectal carcinoma cell lines to adhere and invade through a basement membrane were examined. The four poorly differentiated cell lines studied were three to four times more adherent and spread to a greater extent following adherence to a basement membrane matrix than the three moderately well-differentiated (MWD) lines. One exception was the MWD cell line DLD-2, whose histologic features resembled a signet ring carcinoma. The ability of these cells to invade through a basement membrane model was measured. This assay showed that the poorly differentiated cell lines as well as DLD-2 were three times more invasive than the remaining MWD cell lines. These data indicate that tumor cell adherence can be correlated with invasion through basement membranes. In addition, the ability of colorectal carcinoma cells to interact with the basement membrane seems, in general, to be inversely related to the degree of cytodifferentiation.\r"

To evaluate the therapeutic value of adequate resection and radiation therapy, we conducted a retrospective study of 138 patients treated from 1965 through 1984. Univariate analysis revealed five factors predictive of local failure: (1) age between 18 and 30 years, (2) presentation with recurrent disease, (3) partial or limited margin excision, (4) tumor at or close to the microscopic margin of resection, and (5) radiation therapy not administered for gross residual disease. Multivariate analysis identified two of these factors as having independent predictive value for recurrence: (1) presentation with recurrent disease and (2) less-than-adequate margins of resection. The five-year survival probability was 92%, but 11 of the 138 patients died as a consequence of locally uncontrolled tumor. These findings confirm that desmoid tumors are malignant soft-tissue neoplasms that warrant aggressive therapy.\r"

Therapy was administered to 248 areas during a total of 72 separate treatment sessions after patients received a total of 45 injections of sensitizer. Seven patients had basal cell carcinoma, three had squamous cell carcinoma, three had malignant melanoma, one had liposarcoma, and 12 had breast cancers. One patient had Bowen's disease. Treatment was given either by surface radiation or interstitially. One month after treatment, 48 (67%) of the treatment sessions resulted in a complete response (no clinical evidence of tumor), and 19 (26%) resulted in a partial response (greater than 50% reduction in the number or size of tumors). Fifteen patients were examinable 12 months after treatment, and in this group, 31 treatment sessions were evaluated as a complete response one month after therapy, 15 (48%) of which retained this status at one year after treatment. By comparing the ability of different light-delivery instrumentation, it was concluded that the Yellow Springs radiometer (Yellow Springs Instruments, model 65A, Yellow Springs, Ohio) provided the most reliable spot power density readings. Straight-tipped fibers are nonhomogeneous and can result in overtreatment of the central area with necrosis and pain and in undertreatment of the periphery.\r"

Intact serum and serum ultrafiltrate from 32 patients with cancer and 24 normal volunteers was examined with mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis. Eleven (34%) of serum samples from patients with cancer suppressed blastogenesis, while ultrafiltrate was suppressive in 25 (78%). None of the ultrafiltrate from normal volunteers was suppressive. Six patients with cancer underwent UF in a phase I trial, completing 82 sessions. There were no therapy-related complications, and high-performance liquid chromatography showed significant (greater than 90%) posttreatment reduction in serum suppressor factors.\r"

Two patients refused surgery. There were 31 men and four women; mean age was 62 years. There were 31 adenocarcinomas, eight squamous cell carcinomas, and one metastatic breast carcinoma. Tumor locations were lower esophagus in 35 patients, middle esophagus in three, and cervical esophagus in two. Thirty-five patients had obstructions; two, bleeding, and three, both. None of the patients could swallow solids. A total of 255 treatments were given (mean, 6.6 per patient). The mean number of Nd-YAG treatments was 1.9; for EF, 1.3. All 40 patients tolerated solid food after treatment and the esophagus remained open from three to 14 weeks. Mean survival from first treatment was 11 months; from diagnosis, 17 months.

Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were the most useful diagnostic tools in the evaluation of the presence, size, location, and possible pancreatic ductal communications of the pseudocyst. In a single thick-walled pseudocyst, the best long-term results were achieved by internal drainage. Pancreatic resection is justified if the patient already has diabetes or multiple pseudocysts or if the pseudocyst is not amenable to internal drainage. The most fatal preoperative complication was a sudden arterial bleeding from a pseudocyst. In treating this complication, hemostasis with transcystic arterial ligation and external drainage of the pseudocyst gave the best results.\r"

In upper-third lesions, patients whose tumors showed no serosal infiltration or vessel invasion, were grossly papillary, were papillary or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma histologically, or were treated with hepatic lobectomy had a higher chance of long-term survival. Patients with the middle-third lesions, whose tumors were grossly papillary or nodular or whose margins were tumor-free, were apt to survive longer. Long-term survival for patients with lower-third lesions was obtained most often in patients without lymph node metastasis or vessel invasion.\r"

After the first visit, six patients had biopsies because of a residual mass or a bloodstained aspirate. Of these patients, two were found to have cancer. After the follow-up visit, 20 further biopsies were carried out for presence of a mass, bloodstained fluid, or recurrent fluid, and two more cancers were diagnosed. Of the four patients with malignancy, only one had an intracystic carcinoma, two had necrotic grade 3 ductal carcinomas, and one had a malignant phyllode tumor. These findings underline the value of a single return visit after cyst aspiration.\r"

Detailed neuropsychological testing was accomplished on a cohort of 83 immunologically and neurologically intact asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals drawn from a larger pool of 649 US Air Force personnel with HIV antibodies. These asymptomatic subjects were compared with a group of HIV-negative subjects, and no significant differences in neuropsychological functioning were found. No significant neuropsychological differences were found as a function of cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities in these asymptomatic subjects. When data from 13 subjects with immune compromise were included in the analyses, those with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid values performed significantly poorer on a task of verbal memory, suggesting that cognitive dysfunction is antedated by immunological decline. Methodological problems that inhibit specification of the incidence, prevalence, and natural history of HIV-related cognitive impairment are discussed, as are data suggesting that previously published high estimates of the frequency of HIV-related dementia may not be representative of all HIV-infected populations.\r"

Azure B-RNA staining and scanning-integrating microdensitometry were used to determine total RNA contents of pyramidal neurons in layers 3 and 5. In both PD and AD (1) significant (15% to 47%) RNA loss was detected in neurons of both cortical areas and layers relative to those of aged, nondemented controls, and (2) RNA loss was not markedly enhanced in the damaged frontal cortex relative to that in the preserved occipital cortex. Neuronal RNA depletion was generally more marked in PD than AD. However, this impairment does not appear to be related to the formation of classic neuropathological abnormalities in either disease.\r"

A decline in both serotonin and spiperone binding was found in normal aging, and an AD-related decrease was found for spiperone binding only. The AD-related decrement of spiperone binding occurred irrespective of patient age and duration of disease.

Distinguishing patients with AD from normal elderly individuals, using currently available memory tests, is limited by their lack of suitability for bedside use or for large-scale screening. We have devised a new memory test, a delayed word recall (DWR) test, that is both brief and efficient. It was designed specifically to maximize the likelihood of poor performance in patients with AD and minimize the likelihood of poor performance in normal elderly subjects. The DWR test uses required elaborative processing of to-be-remembered words and delayed free recall. Fifty-five normal elderly subjects and 28 patients with possible or probable AD were tested. The overall predictive accuracy of the DWR test was 95.2%. In addition, scores on the DWR test in normal subjects were not correlated with education or age. The inclusion of the DWR test in a previously studied cognitive detection battery for AD resulted in a considerable improvement in predictive accuracy.\r"

Age, sex, and education were controlled using demographically corrected T scores based on a large normal sample. Both groups showed significant impairment on the test battery, but the degree of dementia was more severe in the patients with AD. A deviation score analysis, controlling for overall level of cognitive impairment, revealed significant differences between the groups. Alzheimer's disease was associated with relatively greater impairment of learning, memory, and verbal skills, whereas the MS group showed greater relative impairment of attention, incidental memory, and psychomotor functions. These data suggest that both the degree and pattern of mental impairement differ in patients with AD and patients with multiple sclerosis. Our results support a distinction between \"gray matter\" and \"white matter\" dementia, and may help clarify the issue of \"cortical\" vs \"subcortical\" dementia by demonstrating neuropsychological differences based on secure neuropathologic distinctions.\r"

Forty-three of 44 subject cases exhibited urinary incontinence compared with 25 of 44 controls with the degree again being more severe in the subject cases. Using the chi 2 test, the probability that these differences were due to chance is minimal. Therefore, bilateral putamen involvement appears to be a significant factor in the occurrence of incontinence, and further study of this association is indicated.\r"

Whereas the R1 response was consistently elicited in the active sleep state, as well as while awake, the ipsilateral R2 response was markedly suppressed and the contralateral R2 response was almost absent. The BR in neonates with neurologic abnormalities showed the following variable results: normal, prolonged latency, or suppressed response at initial recording. Abnormal BRs were detected in most neonates with respiratory or sucking problems. While neonates in whom a suppressed response or prolonged latency persisted for over three months had a poor prognosis, those with normal BRs or early correction of the BR abnormality had almost normal development. The BR appears to be useful not only to evaluate brain-stem function in the neonatal period but also to predict subsequent outcome.\r"

Comparison of the VF results showed an abnormal BRB in at least some carriers of XLRP, particularly those with peripheral fundus pigmentary changes, but not in carriers of choroideremia with even moderately extensive pigmentary changes. The abnormal BRB in XLRP carriers, with or without peripheral fundus pigmentary changes, was associated with at least moderate to moderately extensive reduction in scotopic ERG amplitudes, while the normal VF results in choroideremia carriers were associated with normal scotopic ERG amplitudes. However, in XLRP carriers, mild to modest reductions in ERG scotopic responses were seen in the presence of normal VF findings.\r"

Retinal fluorescein angiography images were used and data were taken using the receiver operating characteristic experimental paradigm. Three ophthalmologists with experience ranging from two to 12 years participated in the study. Sixty-eight images were selected from proof sheets of 800 original images. Next, these images were digitized, then each set was shown on its respective display (slide projection for the proof sheet images and CRT for the digital images). These 68 images were from a variety of patients and represented a broad range of normal and abnormal retinas (including diabetic retinopathy, hypertension independent of diabetes, and sickle-cell disease). Results show (1) that there is no difference between the systems in terms of diagnostic accuracy; (2) that certainty of diagnosis was not a function of the system; and (3) that although there was an effect due to experience of the ophthalmologist, it did not affect diagnosis accuracy. We conclude that CRT displays at conventional video resolutions can deliver the needed diagnostic information as well as film. We also hypothesize that digital enhancement techniques can increase the available diagnostic information beyond that of film.\r"

Of the 271 who had no retinopathy at the first visit, 160 (59%) developed it by the time they were reexamined four years later, and 75 (11%) of the 713 free of proliferative diabetic retinopathy developed it. Overall, worsening of retinopathy occurred in 41% of the population, whereas improvement occurred in only 7%. The incidence of proliferative retinopathy rose with increasing duration until 13 to 14 years of diabetes, thereafter remaining between 14% and 17%. These incidence data underscore the need for careful ophthalmologic follow-up of these people.\r"

Colloid solutions injected into the retrobulbar space inside the extraocular muscle cone did not reach the conjunctiva and did not collect in any lymph nodes over a 24-hour period. Within the orbit, the injected colloids spread along the planes of the connective-tissue septa. No lymphatic vessels were identified within the orbits posterior to the conjunctiva. Small amounts of india ink left the posterior orbit and ultimately entered the contralateral orbit. This posterior pathway did not lead to lymphatic vessels or lymph nodes and therefore does not appear to represent a prelymphatic pathway.\r"

A variety of drugs, used intracamerally or topically following surgery, are also present. These drugs may be bound to the polyanionic hyaluronate molecule. This occurrence may cause drug alterations in therapeutic effectiveness, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. To investigate the possibility for drug-viscoelastic agent adsorption, in vitro drug-binding studies were performed on three commercial viscoelastic agents; undiluted aliquots of Amvisc, Healon, or Viscoat were mixed with radiolabeled D-threo-chloramphenicol, dexamethasone, L-epinephrine, or pilocarpine hydrochloride, placed in dialysis membranes, and dialyzed for 24 hours against an isotonic phosphate buffer. The calculated drug binding by a viscoelastic agent ranged from 0% to 1.5%. These extremely low values for in vitro drug uptake by viscoelastic agents made it unlikely that any significant drug-viscoelastic agent interaction would occur in the postoperative eye.\r"

Choroidal neovascularization occurred in 25 (60%) of 42 lesions, as evidenced by growth of capillaries through breaks in Bruch's membrane. In addition, 24 (28%) of 86 lesions studied by fluorescein angiography demonstrated leakage. This study provides the most complete angiographic, histologic, and ultrastructural documentation of experimental choroidal neovascularization in the rat.

Because family medicine residency programs have been in the forefront of nutrition instruction, a nationwide survey of these programs was conducted to examine the nature, staffing, and funding mechanisms for nutrition education. Results of the 1986 survey reported in this study indicate that registered dietitians were available to 89% of the programs in the United States and are supported by a combination of funding sources. The implications of these findings are discussed.\r"

Overall, the physicians answered 69.2% of the questions correctly, a significantly better score than that of the medical students (62.5%, p = .0065). The physicians scored better on topics that have been the most heavily researched (such as diet and coronary heart disease) and worse on less heavily investigated topics (such as diet and cancer, iron absorption). There was no significant difference in overall knowledge in terms of gender or practice. However, a significant negative correlation was found between the number of years since graduation from medical school and respondents' knowledge about nutrition.\r"

In contemporary times, this mutually supportive covenant is encountering substantial distress. The most noteworthy threats to the traditional covenant are the changing values and erosion of trust emanating from the competition model of delivering and paying for medical services. A creditable response to society's needs and expectations can be best undertaken by establishing a national agenda in academic medicine that places a high priority on health services research and the scientific analysis of our entire health care system. What is needed now is the institutionalization of health services research through expansion of the cadre of health service researchers, while providing a broader emphasis on academic rewards and recognition for initiatives in this critically needed area of investigation.\r"

Many conflicts among nurses, physicians, and health care administrators result from nurses' defining their practice in terms of their patients' needs, and nurses may differ from other health care professionals in interpreting those needs. Nursing education programs--in hospital schools of nursing, community colleges, and baccalaureate colleges--should focus their programs and objectives so as to prepare their graduates for different health care settings. For example, an associate degree program would emphasize preparation for home health care, long-term care, or acute care. The AMA proposal to create a new nursing category--registered care technologist--complicates rather than helps the relationship between physicians and nurses and confuses the issues of providing patient care. Suggestions are offered for alleviating the nursing shortage and resolving much of the continuing conflict between nurses and physicians.\r"

New findings included concerns about malpractice suits and physician impairment. Regarding physician supply in their own communities, 53% of respondents believed that there were too many physicians overall, but 63% believed there were too few black physicians. For the 1940-1969 graduates, loans financed 10% of their medical education, and indebtedness influenced the types of practice chosen by 4%; comparable figures for the 1970-1980 graduates were 25% and 11%.\r"

Under basal conditions, there were no racial differences in 45Ca2+ washout and Cai2+. However, when stimulated by human serum, fibroblasts from blacks exhibited a higher 45Ca2+ washout associated with higher levels of Cai2+ transients than fibroblasts from whites. We conclude that fibroblasts from blacks demonstrate increased responsiveness to agonists in serum. If the same trend exists in vascular smooth muscle cells, it may predispose blacks to essential hypertension.\r"

These cultures were performed in the presence of fetal calf serum (FCS) and stimulated by vasoactive agents (angiotension II, serotonin, bradykinin). Growth rate was determined by cell counting and measurement of nuclear-tritiated thymidine incorporation and phospholipase C (PLC) activation by measurement of 3h-inositol mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-phosphates formed from preincorporated 3h-myo-inositol. Cells from SHR proliferate more actively than control ones in the presence of 10% FCS but don't significantly differ at lower concentrations. In the presence of 5% FCS angiotensin II (10(-7) mol/L), 5-HT (10(-6) mol/L) and bradykinin (10(-6) mol/L) enhance cell proliferation and their effect is more important in cultures from SHR. The phospholipase C activation induced by these drugs was also more important in these SHR cultures than in control ones. The PLC hyperreactivity observed in SHR cells may therefore be involved in their enhanced proliferating activity evidenced in culture and in the vascular abnormalities described in vivo.\r"

Some authors have shown better correlation between BP at work and left ventricular mass (LV mass), whereas other studies supported an association between catecholamines or angiotensin II and LV mass. In this study we investigated the relationship of resting and exercise BP and catecholamines to the degree of LVH. Nineteen patients with established mild to moderate hypertension were studied. Blood pressure was measured following a ten-minute rest and every three minutes during exercise using a Bruce protocol. Electrolytes, epinephrine (EP), and norepinephrine (NE) were measured at rest, at peak exercise, and at ten-minutes postexercise. Resting BP averaged 154 +/- 24/99 +/- 9 mm Hg and at three minutes of exercise 195 +/- 30/101 +/- 6 (P less than .001). Resting EP was 51 +/- 20 pg/mL, NE 314 +/- 187, and at peak exercise EP was 107 +/- 61 (P less than .001) and NE 1016 +/- 566 (P less than .001). The average LV mass was 277 +/- 85 g. A significant correlation was found only between systolic BP at three minutes of exercise and LV mass (r = .479, P less than .04). No other variable correlated significantly with LV mass. These data suggest that systolic BP achieved at low level of exercise (5 mets), corresponding to usual daily activities, may be the most important determinant of LVH in patients with hypertension.\r"

We have tested the relationship between BP and left ventricular (LV) mass in 23 normotensive young adults (mean age 25 +/- 5) with normotensive parents. Blood pressure was measured at rest, at the end of maximal exercise test, and during 24-hour ambulatory monitoring during daily routine. Left ventricular mass was assessed with M-mode echocardiography. We found a closer relationship between LV mass with BP when measuring during activity (average day time BP and end exercise BP) than with rest BP (rest BP and average nighttime BP). Multiple regression analysis indicates an independent association of LV mass with both average day time and end exercise systolic blood pressure. Thus, we conclude that these two ways of assessing \"activity\" BP may be more complementary than opposing. Ambulatory BP monitoring appreciates the reactions to daily stresses and the exercise test measures the response to physical activity.\r"

To study this question, 15 cats underwent supraventricular aortic banding and five underwent a sham procedure. After ten weeks, the animals were anesthetized and instrumented using paired transmural plunge electrodes and endocardial quadripolar pacing catheters. Measurement of pacing threshold, refractoriness, inducibility of ventricular arrhythmias (using programmed electrical stimulation), and vulnerability to ventricular fibrillation (ventricular fibrillation threshold) were made in both groups. Mean left ventricular mass was significantly greater in the banded compared with sham-operated animals (2.5 +/- 0.9 v 2.1 +/- 0.5 g/kg body weight; P less than .05). Pacing thresholds and refractory periods measured at multiple left and right ventricular sites were similar in both groups, and there was no difference in the extent of site-to-site differences in refractoriness (dispersion). Six banded but no sham animals had inducible ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation using programmed stimulation. Furthermore, left ventricular mass was significantly greater in animals with inducible arrhythmias compared with those noninducible (P less than .05). Ventricular fibrillation thresholds, measured in milliamperes (mA), in the banded animals were significantly lower in the left ventricle (13.5 +/- 1.3 mA) than in the right (21.7 +/- 3.2 mA; P less than .05) and was also lower than the thresholds obtained in either the left or right ventricle of the sham-operated animals (18.3 +/- 1.9 mA and 20.1 +/- 1.1 mA, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the present study, we compared rates of calcium influx and efflux in isolated duodenal enterocytes in SHR and corresponding controls, Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). The early (0 to 1 minute) and the late (1 to 15 minute) phase of calcium influx rates at 1.0 mmol Ca2+ in the incubation medium were lower in the SHR than in the WKY (mean +/- SEM): 1.93 +/- 0.22 v 2.85 +/- 0.41 nmol/mg protein/min, n = 8 and n = 7 experiments, respectively, P less than .05; and 0.334 +/- 0.025 v 0.488 +/- 0.059 nmol/mg protein/min, n = 14 pairs, P less than .01. The calcium efflux rate constant of the SHR was reduced: 34.3 +/- 1.4 v 51.9 +/- 1.4% per hour, n = 11 pairs, P less than .01. However, in the absence of sodium or the presence of ouabain (4.0 mmol) in the incubation medium, a decrease in this constant was observed in the WKY but not in the SHR. These data, at the cellular level, support our previous observation in intact tissue of reduced active transduodenal calcium transport in the 12- to 14-week-old SHR. Whether the primary defect in calcium transport involves the luminal or the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte, or whether both disturbances are due to a common primary perturbation cannot be deduced from the present experiments.\r"

  ".W": "The present study was carried out to investigate the role of calmodulin in the adrenergic transmission of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension. In perfused mesenteric vasculatures prepared from DOCA-salt hypertensive rats (seven to eight weeks after operation) and age-matched normotensive control rats, the effects of a specific calmodulin antagonist (W-7: N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide) on the norepinephrine release and vascular responsiveness were examined. Endogenous norepinephrine overflow during electrical nerve stimulation was significantly greater in the mesenteric vasculatures of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats both at low (5 Hz) and high (15 Hz) frequencies than in those of the normotensive controls. Vasoconstrictor responses to electrical nerve stimulation or exogenous norepinephrine were also enhanced in the DOCA-salt hypertension compared to those in the controls. The calmodulin antagonist (W-7) inhibited the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine overflow and pressor responses in a dose-dependent manner. The suppressive magnitudes in these responses by W-7 were significantly greater in the mesenteric vasculatures of the DOCA-salt hypertension than in those of the control rats. These results demonstrate that the vascular adrenergic neurotransmission might be enhanced in the mesenteric vasculatures of the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Further, it is suggested that the marked reduction in stimulation-evoked norepinephrine overflow and vasoconstrictor responses by W-7 showed the greater calmodulin-dependent regulation in the vascular adrenergic activity of DOCA-salt hypertension.\r"

Adrenalectomized SHR were replaced with 6 micrograms/24 h aldosterone (ALDO), 10 microgram/24 h dexamethasone (DEX), or both aldosterone and dexamethasone (ALDO + DEX) by IP osmotic mini-pumps. These were compared to sham-operated SHR (SHAM) and adrenalectomized SHR given no steroid replacement (ADX). Drinking fluid for all groups was 1% NaCl + 2.5% glucose. Six days after adrenalectomy, intra-arterial mean arterial pressure (MAP) fell from 174 +/- 2 to 149 +/- 6 mm Hg in ALDO (n = 8, P less than .01) and from 179 +/- 4 to 125 +/- 4 in ADX (n = 6, P less than .01). In contrast, MAP rose in SHAM from 171 +/- 4 to 179 +/- 5 mm Hg (n = 7, P less than .01), in ALDO + DEX from 161 +/- 3 to 184 +/- 4 mm Hg (n = 7, P less than .01), and in DEX from 162 +/- 2 to 181 +/- 4 mm Hg (n = 7, P less than .01). The results indicate that when diet salt intake is high, glucocorticoid action is necessary for the full expression of hypertension in adult SHR.\r"

They consist of at least one technician and one small research room (220 square feet), with an additional small room (280 square feet), and 1/4 technician for every MD or PhD in the department (r = 0.72). Persons who are not active researchers with external funding must first define the research question in order to develop fundable research proposals. Clinical research is a process that starts from the clinical situation, leads to formulation and answering of the question, and eventually results in integration back into clinical practice. There are many reasons for posing a clinical research question and each results in a different type of question. Asking the right question is the most important part of research, as how the problem is stated determines what data is to be collected, the analysis to be done, and what kind of conclusions can be drawn. A strong research study addresses questions that are clearly spelled out and leads to conclusions that are within the limits of the experimental design and the availability, reliability, and validity of the data. Complex design and analysis do not make a study better if the question itself is not well formulated. It is not as important to know how to answer the question as it is to know how to ask the question. If the initial question is incomplete or incorrect, the rest of the research is at best irrelevant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

This study developed a normative mathematical model for pain tolerance using the cold pressor test with over 600 subjects. Norms for age, sex, and ethnic group were calculated. In addition, chronic pain patients were compared with pain-free patients to determine normative differences in response. The results indicate that at any given age Anglo-Saxon males have the longest tolerance time followed by non-Anglo-Saxon males, Anglo-Saxon females, and finally non-Anglo-Saxon females. There is a consistent decrease in tolerance time as the male age increases and minimal change in tolerance time as the female age increases. Chronic pain patients exhibited the same type of pain response pattern as healthy volunteers when corrected for age, sex, and ethnocultural subgroup.\r"

The transseptal-transsphenoidal approach is appropriate for biopsy or for subtotal removal of small midline lesions of the upper (retrosellar) clivus only. The radical pterygomaxillotomy approach is used for gaining access to chordomas of the upper half of the clivus, with or without lateral extension. Removal of the lateral, posterior, and (if necessary) medial walls of the maxillary sinus is followed by resection of most of the contents of the pterygopalatine fossa. The pterygoid plates are then removed with a drill. The sphenoid sinus and upper clivus are then exposed for tumor removal. For more inferior lesions, we have modified the transoral-transpharyngeal approach by creating an inferiorly based posterior pharyngeal flap, which increases exposure of the clivus, particularly laterally. This flap can be extended laterally for paraclival extension. This approach allows removal of the lateral clivus as far laterally as the hypoglossal canal, with no dissection of tongue, mandible, lip, or cervical soft tissues.\r"

The technique is different from previously reported combined craniofacial ablative procedures in that the head and neck surgeon and the neurosurgeon approach the anterior fossa mass through the same facial incision, thus avoiding the need for a separate craniotomy incision. The formation of a vascularized nasofrontal bone flap allows for better wound healing regardless of preoperative and postoperative radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. This report presents 42 cases in which the transfacial approach was exclusively used in a combined manner to remove nasal, paranasal sinus, and nasopharyngeal neoplasms. The transfacial technique offers a significant advantage over previously described approaches to the anterior skull base.\r"

By reflecting the ascending ramus, this method provides excellent exposure of the concerned areas. It makes unnecessary both incision of the lower lip and intermaxillary fixation with arch bars, thus allowing a quick resumption of oral feeding. A review of 15 patients demonstrated satisfactory results for mandibular function and morphologic appearance, with minimal complications.\r"

Explanation for this includes the higher proportion of patients with less aggressive histologic subtypes seen in recent years, as well as the fact that many of our patients treated before 1966 had surgical procedures considered inadequate by current standards. We also believe that adjunctive radiation oncology enhanced survival, but it could not be proved in this retrospective study. Multivariate analysis confirms that the clinical stage was the most important prognostic variable.\r"

Ninety cases of salivary gland neoplasm are analyzed to provide a clearer understanding of the appropriate approach to occult salivary gland cervical metastases. Manifest regional metastases at the original presentation were absent in 72% (65/90). Few nodal metastases occurred after the primary tumor was controlled (2% [1/56]). Local recurrence (38% [34/90]) and distant metastases (25% [14/56]) were more common. Stage I and II disease was treated by surgical resection of the primary tumor alone; resection was combined with postoperative radiation therapy for stage III disease. Whenever the neck was entered for stage III disease, a conservative neck dissection was incorporated with the resection to reduce the postoperative irradiation field once the neck had been proved N, O histologically. Delayed nodal metastasis was treated by neck dissection alone.\r"

Sixteen patients (11.9%) died of disease during a ten- to 20-year follow-up period. Significant factors associated with death from disease were aged 40 years or older, primary lesion size of 2.5 cm or greater, presence of invasive characteristics, and presence of distant metastases.

While there were four marginal and 13 major reconstructive failures, 11 of the latter were successfully managed with an alternative flap, thus providing a prompt and effective palliation for most of these patients. An evolution in our choice of reconstructive procedures as well as a recent trend toward using MGR as a primary therapeutic modality were noted. Data relating to speech following reconstruction and diet rehabilitation were encouraging, particularly with the use of the latissimus dorsi flap. Survival following MGR, however, was dismal due to early local and regional recurrence.\r"

  ".W": "A skin island carried by pectoralis major muscle has been used to reconstruct an intraoral defect created after resection of a tumor. To our knowledge, what happens to the skin after its mobilization from the chest wall into the mouth has not been documented. To answer this, a wedge biopsy of the intraoral skin island on the pectoralis muscle was performed in 14 patients under local anesthesia. The skin biopsy specimen was subjected to scanning electron microscopic and histologic examination. The interval between the reconstructive surgery and the biopsy ranged from ten to 66 months (mean, 32 months). The results revealed desquamation of the epidermis and loss of appendages. The degree of desquamation was maximal when the skin island was used to replace the whole of the floor of the mouth and least when it was used for the lateral portion.\r"

  ".W": "Eight superior and eight transantral decompressions were performed in 16 fresh cadaver orbits in which intraorbital pressure was experimentally increased by adding 12 mL of volume to an intraorbital balloon. Each decompression yielded a mean pressure decrease of 225 mm Hg (85% of the total) in experimentally induced intraorbital pressure. The maximal pressure decrease occurred after the removal of the first complete orbital wall. However, incision of the periorbita was most effective in achieving globe recession and a decrease in exophthalmos. Although the steps of the superior and transantral decompression techniques are not comparable, there was no statistically significant difference between the total net pressure decreases achieved.\r"
