  ".U": "89044562\r", 
  ".W": "In a chronic dog model, colocolostomies with intact blood supplies were constructed with the circular stapler. By means of \"tight\" stapling, an ischemic suture line was induced (suture line blood flow reduced to less than 10% of baseline mucosal blood flow). Under these conditions, only one of 20 anastomoses resulted in stenosis at 1 month. Correctly stapled colocolostomies were then performed in bowels rendered ischemic by removal of all mesenteric arcades for 4 to 6 cm. Mucosal blood flow in such ischemic bowels was reduced to 30% and 16% of control, respectively, and suture line blood flow was as low as that of the tightly stapled anastomoses. Significant stenosis (more than 68% reduction of the lumen) was observed in the group with 6 cm of mesenteric clearance. In no dogs did peritonitis or colonic gangrene develop. Gross and histologic revascularization was evident when dogs were killed at 6 weeks. These findings suggest that it is ischemia of the bowel, rather than ischemia at the suture line itself, that leads to anastomotic stricture. In view of the known susceptibility of the human intestine to ischemia, the model may have overstated the degree of ischemia necessary to produce strictures in clinical practice. Since the induced acute ischemia did not persist in the chronic state, we conclude that it is the adequacy of collateral development that determines the outcome in this model.\r"

That the ovarian tumor was the source of gastrin production was established by preoperative and postoperative gastrin and gastric secretory studies and by specific immunocytochemistry of the excised tissue. After oophorectomy, each patient was apparently cured of the disease. Ovarian gastrinomas may not be as uncommon as is generally believed and should be considered as a possible cause of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in any female patient in whom a primary gastrointestinal or pancreatic tumor cannot be located.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of partial excision and wound closure on the postburn hypermetabolic state. A 25% of total body surface burn was produced in seven sheep. Oxygen consumption (VO2) was significantly increased to 215 +/- 44 ml/min/M2 by day 3 compared with baseline of 125 +/- 21 ml/min/M2. The calculated increase was the result of the increased cardiac index as the average oxygen (AvO2) difference remained relatively constant. Body temperature was not significantly increased. Plasma and burn lymph thromboxane B2 were significantly increased. On day 7, 60% of the burn was completely excised to fascia and covered with a full-thickness graft from a donor animal. The VO2 decreased to below preburn levels during the period of anesthesia but returned completely to the preexcision hypermetabolic state by 2 hours after anesthesia and remained at this level for the remaining 2-day postexcision period. Quantitative cultures of burn hide at day 7 postburn and of the remaining 10% of total body surface burn at 2 days after excision revealed values less than 10(5) bacteria/gram eschar. No positive blood cultures were evident. We conclude that postburn hypermetabolism, once developed, may be perpetuated by a burn of lesser size. Partial excision, therefore, does not appear to significantly decrease the hypermetabolic state if a substantial inflammatory wound remains. Infection is not necessary to perpetuate the increased VO2.\r"

There were 32 male and 37 female patients, with a mean age of 38 years at operation (range, 13 to 76 years). Forty-two cysts were solitary, 20 multiple, and 7 bilateral; 45 were located in the left lobe. Radical surgical procedures were carried out in 45 patients and consisted of cystectomy in six, pericystectomy in 25, and hepatectomy in 14; a conservative approach was used in 11 (resection of prominent part, internal or external drainage). The remaining 13 patients underwent a combination of both techniques. There were no deaths. Postoperative morbidity was low and equally distributed whether surgery was radical or conservative. Local complications occurred in six patients (9%), and seven other patients (10%) had systemic disorders. Four patients required reoperation: two for hemostasis and two for persistent fistulae (one biliary and one bronchobiliary). Of the 42 patients available for follow-up (61%), four (9%) had recurrent disease. One had undergone a pericystectomy and three, conservative procedures, at the time of primary surgery. Our results support the view that excisional surgery is a safe and valid option for patients with hydatid liver disease.\r"

We investigated the release of VIP in a hyperdynamic model of sepsis in awake, conscious dogs similar to that of sepsis in human beings. Sepsis was induced by intraperitoneal implantation of a fibrin clot containing live Escherichia coli (0.9 +/- 0.2 X 10(9) organisms per kilogram of body weight). All dogs developed hyperdynamic sepsis with increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance. During the first 24 hours of sepsis, VIP was released without a concomitant decrease in blood pressure, suggesting that during septic shock it was released by a direct mechanism rather than as a result of hypotension. During peak VIP release (2 to 4 hours after induction of sepsis) no decreases in systemic vascular resistance or mean arterial pressure were observed. This suggests that mediators other than VIP may be responsible for the vasodilation observed during sepsis. The precise role of VIP during sepsis is therefore yet to be clarified.\r"

  ".W": "Although the internal mammary artery (IMA) is superior to the saphenous vein graft for bypassing certain coronary arterial obstructive lesions, such operations may predispose the patient to sternal infection or dehiscence--presumably as a result of sternal ischemia. This study was designed to measure sternal blood flow before and after median sternotomy and IMA mobilization in order to quantify the hemodynamic effects of these procedures. Rhesus primates were randomized into control, unilateral IMA-harvested, and bilateral IMA-harvested groups. After selective angiography enabled confirmation of IMA patency, 15 micron microscopheres, labeled with specific-spectra radioactive isotopes, were injected at baseline, after sternotomy, and after IMA harvesting. The sternal halves were subjected to gamma counting, and sternal circulation was accurately quantified. Our results showed that blood flow to the sternal halves in which the IMA was harvested decreased precipitously (from 4.5 to 0.8 ml/gm/min; p less than or equal to 0.001), although it remained unchanged in response to median sternotomy. This represented a 90% decrease in the mean rate of flow within the IMA-harvested sterna versus a stable flow rate for the unharvested sides. We conclude that mobilization of the internal mammary artery, as in coronary bypass procedures, significantly devascularizes the sternal half from which it was harvested.\r"

We have recently encountered five patients with Takayasu's arteritis whose symptoms and findings demonstrate the clinical spectrum of this disease. All five patients are women, with a current mean age of 41 years. Although findings at initial evaluations included systemic manifestations and elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in four patients, the fifth patient had a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate and signs of abdominal aortic occlusion. Two patients had a history of hypertension, and four patients complained of upper- or lower-extremity claudication. Arteriographic examination revealed aortic arch branch vessel involvement (type I) in two patients who also had aortic valvular insufficiency; three patients had combined arch vessel and distal aortic disease (type III). All patients have been maintained on steroid medications, and one patient has undergone a trial of cytotoxic agents. Three patients underwent surgical procedures: aortic valve replacement in two patients, and aortorenal bypass in one patient. Takayasu's arteritis gives rise to a variety of symptoms and findings resulting from the distribution and severity of the inflammatory process. With adequate immunosuppression and selective application of surgical therapy, there is a good prognosis for survival and a return to functional status.\r"

Although originally attributed to stasis and inspissated bile with subsequent obstruction of the cystic duct, acalculous cholecystitis has more recently been attributed to gallbladder ischemia from such conditions as hypotension or vasculitis. However, a significant number of cases of acute acalculous cholecystitis occur with no obvious cause. This report notes acute acalculous cholecystitis, diagnosed in 12 patients from 1982 to 1987, that was apparently precipitated by initiation of antibiotic therapy. Histologic sections of these gallbladders each disclosed a massive eosinophilic infiltrate. Two of the patients had identical signs, symptoms, and abnormal laboratory values during a previous course of erythromycin. These findings subsided when the antibiotic therapy was discontinued. We hypothesize that a significant cause of acute acalculous cholecystitis may be a hypersensitivity reaction to concurrent antibiotic therapy. Such patients should have antibiotic therapy halted or altered, which, it is hoped, will result in resolution of symptoms and avoidance of unnecessary laparotomy.\r"

Seven patients (1%) died, five of perioperative stroke and two of myocardial infarction. Thirty-one patients suffered a perioperative stroke (4.5% of the 688 endarterectomies); 20 patients (2.9% of 688) were left with moderate to severe neurologic deficits. The combined mortality/major neurologic deficit morbidity rate (number of patients divided by number of endarterectomies) is 3.2%. Both operative mortality and morbidity have progressively declined in successive 5-year periods, with no deaths and a 2.7% stroke rate in 148 endarterectomies performed after 1984.

Stroke incidence increased exponentially with age. After adjustment to the age and sex distribution of the Danish population in 1980, the estimated incidence of first stroke was 1.41/1000 women and 2.48/1000 men; the total incidence was 1.94/1000 population. Risk factor analysis was based on the initial examination of 13,088 persons greater than 35 years old without previous stroke who responded to the first invitation, in whom 295 first strokes were subsequently observed. We used the regression model of Cox. However, our use of this model differs from the somewhat automatic procedures normally used to develop prognostic models. Evaluation of the causative effect of a particular risk factor requires that the direction of mutual influences between the factor in question and other risk factors is established/postulated. Among the 16 potential risk factors for stroke we examined, significant effects were found for age, sex, household income, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, plasma cholesterol concentration, ischemic heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. No significant effect could be demonstrated for a positive family history of stroke, years of school education, marital status, alcohol consumption, daily use of tranquilizers, body mass index, or postmenopausal hormone treatment.\r"

The probabilities of reaching independence in ambulation, being able to walk 150 feet with assistance, reaching independence in self-care function, and reaching a point of assisted self care (Barthel Index score of greater than or equal to 60) are highly significantly different among subgroups. The interval after stroke required to reach the plateau phase of recovery is also significantly different among subgroups. We propose that life table analysis can be used 1) to define patient outcome goals, 2) to define the time required to reach such goals, 3) to identify patients with medical or behavioral comorbidity who are functioning below their expected level, and 4) to assess the effect of alternative treatment regimens on both final outcome and time to reach that outcome.\r"

Fructosamine concentration reflects the degree of glycemia in the preceding 4-6 weeks and glycosylated hemoglobin concentration reflects that in the preceding 3 months. Based on clinical, computed tomographic, and necropsy findings, strokes were classified as cortical infarction, lacunar infarction, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Analyses were done including and excluding 47 diabetic patients. No correlation between neurologic outcome as mortality and fructosamine or glycosylated hemoglobin concentration was found. Survival showed a significant correlation with admission glucose concentration only for patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. Our results suggest that hyperglycemia is unlikely to worsen the outcome of acute stroke and that hyperglycemia probably represents either a latent diabetic state or a stress response.\r"

  ".W": "The oxygen free radical-induced lipid peroxidative reactions that occur during resuscitation from normothermic cardiac arrest may contribute to the degree of neurologic dysfunction sustained. A blinded, randomized experimental trial was performed to determine whether U74006F, a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, reduces morbidity and 24-hour mortality after 10 minutes of normothermic cardiopulmonary arrest; ventricular fibrillation was induced by electrical stimulation in 24 open-chest, halothane-anesthetized dogs, and circulation was reestablished by direct cardiac compressions, administration of a standardized drug regime, and internal countershocks. When spontaneous circulation was restored, a bolus injection of 1.5 mg/kg U74006F (n = 12) or 25 mM citrate vehicle (n = 12) was infused intravenously in 15 minutes and an infusion was continued at 0.125 mg/kg/hr for the next 12 hours. In the drug-treated group, plasma U74006F concentration averaged 0.13 microgram/ml between 3 and 12 hours after cardiac arrest. By 24 hours after arrest, 10 of 12 (83%) vehicle-treated dogs had died but only four of 12 (33%) U74006F-treated dogs had died (p = 0.017). U74006F-treated dogs survived significantly longer (mean +/- SEM 22 +/- 1 hr) than vehicle-treated dogs (18 +/- 1 hr), with significantly better neurologic function 1, 2, and 24 hours after arrest. Plasma fatty acid hydroperoxide concentrations 12 hours after arrest were 88 +/- 81 pmol/ml in U74006F-treated and 241 +/- 49 pmol/ml in vehicle-treated dogs (p less than 0.05). Vitamin E concentrations were significantly higher in the plasma of U74006F-treated dogs 2, 3, and 6 hours after arrest compared with vehicle-treated dogs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "In 27 cats treated to vary arterial serum glucose concentrations, we measured cerebral high-energy phosphate metabolite concentration and intracellular pH using in vivo phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy during transient global cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. Hypoglycemia was induced with 4 units/kg i.v. insulin in six cats before ischemia; hyperglycemia was induced with 1.5 g/kg i.v. glucose in six cats before and in six cats during ischemia. Nine untreated cats subjected to ischemia without manipulation of blood glucose concentration served as controls. During ischemia, intracellular pH fell to similar levels in the control and both hyperglycemic groups. During reperfusion, the hyperglycemic before ischemia group initially exhibited a severe further decline in intracellular pH (p less than 0.003); this further decline was not observed in the control or the hyperglycemic during ischemia groups. Intracellular acidosis was attenuated both during ischemia and early after reperfusion in the hypoglycemic before ischemia group. In all groups, cerebral high-energy phosphate metabolite concentrations were depleted during ischemia and then recovered to the same degree during reperfusion. Our data suggest that brain glucose stores before ischemia determine the severity and time course of intracellular acidosis during ischemia and reperfusion.\r"

Seven days after occlusion, the gerbils were perfusion-fixed and neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 sector was assessed. The mean +/- SEM neuronal density in nine unoperated normal gerbils was 307 +/- 9/mm, in 10 untreated ischemic gerbils 55 +/- 21/mm, and in seven vehicle-treated ischemic gerbils 15 +/- 9/mm. The mean +/- SEM neuronal density in ischemic gerbils treated with 1, 2, 5, or 10 mg/kg indomethacin was 132 +/- 28/mm, 154 +/- 29/mm, 176 +/- 30/mm, and 136 +/- 39/mm, respectively.

In control rats, HIPDm rCBF (indicator fractionation method, n = 5) was lower than the corresponding IAP rCBF (diffusible indicator method, n = 4), most notably in the infratentorial regions and subcortical nuclei. In hypercapnia, rCBF increased by 100% and 37% in the HIPDm (n = 5) and IAP (n = 5) groups, respectively. In hypocapnia, IAP rCBF (n = 4) decreased 34% but HIPDm rCBF (n = 4) did not change. Following disruption of the blood-brain barrier by intracarotid infusion of mannitol in eight rats, both radiotracers (HIPDm n = 4, IAP n = 4) showed decreased rCBF to regions of disruption as defined by trypan blue extravasation. Our work indicates that modeling HIPDm uptake to quantify rCBF using the indicator fractionation method will underestimate blood flow and that HIPDm kinetics are influenced by compartmental pH dynamics that will limit the accuracy of this method in quantifying rCBF in pathologic conditions.\r"

The rabbits were observed closely for clinical symptoms, and angiographic and pathologic investigations were performed. Thirteen experimental rabbits showed a progressing neurologic deficit that was worst on the fourth or fifth day after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. This symptomatic change did not occur in five rabbits without previous carotid ligation. Presumably, the rabbits with carotid ligation became symptomatic because they no longer had a collateral blood flow to compensate for the reduced blood flow in the basilar artery after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our model of symptomatic vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage may be beneficial for future studies.\r"

Nine of the 11 patients were found to have a left atrial myxoma; right atrial myxomas were identified in two. Five of the 11 patients (45%) had abnormalities on neurologic examination, and five of five had computed tomographic evidence of nonhemorrhagic cerebral infarction. Neurologic symptoms were the initial presentation in four patients. Six patients reported a history of cardiac disease; eight of the 11 had abnormalities on cardiac auscultation. Echocardiography in 10 patients was diagnostic in all but one. Gated magnetic resonance imaging of the heart in two patients demonstrated myxoma position and movement. Follow-up examinations (varying from 1 month to 7 years after tumor resection) in nine of 11 patients demonstrated no recurrent neurologic symptoms. Cerebral infarction is a common complication of atrial myxomas and may be the presenting feature. Recurrent cerebral emboli before surgery is not uncommon. Cardiac auscultation may be normal, and electrocardiographic changes are often nonspecific. Delayed neurologic events following surgery are rare.\r"

A prospective study involving 25 patients (15 males, 10 females) with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) was undertaken to examine the clinical value of these two markers. Patients' ages ranged from twenty-five to seventy-seven years (mean 56 years). The group consisted of 9 Stage I, 1 Stage II, 5 Stage III, and 10 Stage IV patients. Twenty three of the 25 had known disease present when tested. Eleven patients with no known tumor were used as an age-matched control group. Sixteen of the 23 patients with known disease (70%) had elevated LASA values. Nine of the 11 control patients (82%) had normal LASA values. Three of 7 patients with values obtained pre- and post-nephrectomy showed levels returned to normal after nephrectomy; 3 had persistent LASA elevation and were found to have either metastatic or recurrent disease, and 1 had a persistent elevation of his LASA value without known metastatic or recurrent disease. When the 23 patients with known disease were compared according to stage, 62 percent of Stages I and II, 80 percent of Stage III, and 70 percent of Stage IV had elevated LASA values. There was no statistically significant difference between LASA values and tumor stage. CA 19-9 values obtained in 15 of 25 patients with RCC were within normal range.\r"

  ".W": "Orchiectomy is the preferred method for treating patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate (MAP) because it is safer and more reliable than estrogen therapy. Nonetheless, a survey of Northern California urologists showed that 57 percent of their patients with MAP were treated with diethylstilbestrol (DES) rather than orchiectomy. Factors which determined treatment selection include the physician's belief that estrogen therapy was either equally (35%) or more (22%) effective than orchiectomy and the patients' rejection of orchiectomy even if it were recommended to them (20-30%). The survey also showed that previous attempts to increase the acceptability of orchiectomy by performing a subcapsular procedure have failed because urologists do not believe the procedure is effective (45%), or that subcapsular orchiectomy provides a satisfactory cosmetic result (20%). Recent laboratory and clinical investigations have shown that complete and subcapsular orchiectomy were equally effective in reducing serum testosterone. Patient acceptance of subcapsular orchiectomy may be increased by utilizing the term testicular curettage, which does not imply castration, to describe the procedure and by implantation of intracapsular testicular prostheses to restore normal testicular anatomy after the testicles' hormone-producing tissue has been removed.\r"

This technique has two merits: (1) availability of a sufficient length of submucosal ureter without altering the original ureteral entrance bilaterally; and (2) easy ligation of the new orifices in the middle of the operative field.

Compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots may lead to structural neuronal damage, neuronal ischemia or edema, and axonal transport block. The most frequent symptom in patients with spinal stenosis is back pain and some have classic neurogenic claudication. We have performed urodynamic evaluations in 2 patients with combined cervical and lumbar spinal stenosis. A girl with achondroplastic dwarfism had urgency incontinence and detrusor hyperreflexia. An adult man with acquired degenerative spinal stenosis had difficulty voiding and findings compatible with the cauda equina syndrome.\r"

Ten cases had rupture of the interventricular septum. The clinical and pathological records were reviewed, and the rupture group was compared with a control group of 100 patients who died from acute myocardial infarction without rupture. Of the patients with rupture, 85% died during the first week after the onset of myocardial infarction; three patients with rupture died suddenly without previous clinical evidence of myocardial infarction. Rupture occurred only in hearts with transmural infarcts, and predominantly in the anteroseptal wall. Patients with rupture had significantly higher blood pressure, fewer previous infarcts, higher frequency of coronary thrombi, less myocardial scar tissue and lower heart weight compared to the control group. There were no significant differences regarding age and sex distribution, physical effort at the symptom debut or death, medication, previous and present diseases other than infarcts, complications or the degree of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries or aorta.\r"

Ambulatory monitoring was initiated for 36 hours after all prophylactic antianginal medication had been withdrawn for 5 days. There were 196 episodes of ST-segment depression, 145 (74%) of which were not accompanied by angina. As well, a tendency to more prolonged and greater ST-segment change with symptomatic ischaemic episodes was noted. A diurnal variation in transient ischaemia both with and without symptoms was observed, the highest frequency being in the morning hours. Transient myocardial ischaemia was more frequent in patients with double or triple vessel disease, compared with single vessel disease, but with a great variation. Heart rate at the onset of ischaemia during ambulatory monitoring was significantly lower than heart rate at the onset of ST-segment change during exercise testing (100.2 +/- 14.6 vs. 115.8 +/- 19.6 beats/min, p less than 0.01), which may indicate different pathophysiological mechanisms. Transient impairment in coronary oxygen supply seems to be of importance during ischaemic episodes out of hospital.\r"

Triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations of whole serum and of different serum lipoprotein fractions were also determined. Analyses were performed prior to and after a drug treatment period of 6 weeks, during which all the patients were weight stable. Treatment caused a decrease in serum concentrations of apolipoproteins C-I, C-II, C-III and E. These highly significant reductions were all positively correlated to a reduction of very low density lipoprotein triglyceride levels of serum (r-values greater than 0.76, p less than 0.001). There were highly significant decreases in serum levels of apolipoprotein B and low density lipoprotein total cholesterol. These reductions were positively intercorrelated (r = 0.55; p less than 0.01). Similar effects were observed in the different HLP types and in both sexes. Treatment resulted in normolipidemia in 12 patients, who were hypercholesterolemic (7 type IIa, 3 type IIb, 2 type III hyperlipoproteinemia) prior to treatment. The serum apolipoprotein B concentrations of these 12 patients fell after therapy to values which, however, remained abnormally high. We suggest that serum lipid adjusting treatment should aim at a normalization not only of serum lipid concentrations but also of the serum apolipoprotein B concentration in order to achieve a maximal antiatherogenic effect.\r"

  ".W": "The antihypertensive effect of a new vasodilating drug, pinacidil, was compared with prazosin in a randomized, open study in general practice including 131 patients with a sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between 100-115 mmHg. At inclusion 108 patients were untreated and the remaining patients were on treatment with thiazide diuretics and/or beta-blockers. The aim was to reduce the sitting DBP to less than or equal to 95 mmHg, which was achieved in 85% of the patients treated with pinacidil and in 77% of the patients treated with prazosin (NS). In the responding patients the reductions were (mean +/- SD) 16 +/- 7 mmHg (p less than 0.001) and 13 +/- 6 mmHg (p less than 0.001) in the pinacidil group (n = 60) and the prazosin group (n = 46), respectively (p less than 0.10). During 5 months of maintenance therapy no statistically significant differences in blood pressures between the two treatment groups were present. Side-effects were typical of vasodilator therapy, i.e. headache, dizziness, tachycardia and edema, leading to discontinuation of therapy in 10 patients in each treatment group. Heart rate (HR) was increased with pinacidil and unchanged with prazosin. Edema was frequently seen with pinacidil and dizziness with prazosin. Because of edema a thiazide diuretic was given to nine patients in the pinacidil group and two patients in the prazosin group. No clinically significant changes in ECG and biochemical variables were observed. In conclusion, the study has demonstrated that pinacidil is as effective an antihypertensive agent as prazosin. Pinacidil may be used as monotherapy. However, the study suggests that pinacidil should be used as add-on therapy to thiazide diuretics.\r"

  ".U": "89046707\r", 
  ".W": "Non-invasive estimation of the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was accomplished by simultaneous electrocardiographic, phonocardiographic and continuous wave Doppler echocardiographic recordings. The interval from the onset of the QRS complex to the Doppler determined mitral valve closure (Q-MC) and the interval from the phonocardiographic aortic component of the second heart sound to the Doppler determined mitral valve opening (A2-MO) were measured. The non-invasive registrations were carried out simultaneously with direct measurements of the wedge pressure. In an initial group of 22 patients, a significant correlation was observed between the intervals alone and the wedge pressure, r = 0.60, SEE = +/- 6.9 mmHg, p less than 0.01, for the Q-MC interval and r = -0.70, SEE = 6.2 mmHg, p less than 0.001 for the A2-MO interval. A closer correlation was observed between the ratio Q-MC/A2-MO and the measured wedge pressure, r = 0.93, SEE = +/- 3.1 mmHg, p less than 0.001. The linear regression equation, PCW = 19.5 (Q-MC/A2-MO) + 3.0 (mmHg), was applied prospectively to a second group of 23 patients. Again the relationship between estimated and measured wedge pressure was highly significant, r = 0.90, SEE = +/- 3.1 mmHg, p less than 0.001. Twenty-two patients were also studied during an exercise test, and acceptable non-invasive recordings were obtained in 19 of them. The change in estimated wedge pressure during activity related closely to the change in actual wedge pressure, r = 0.80, SEE = +/- 5.7 mmHg, p less than 0.001. A simplified equation suitable for routine clinical practice, PCW = 24 (Q-MC/A2-MO) (mmHg), yielded almost equally accurate estimates of the wedge pressure over a wide range of pressures. The simplicity and reasonable accuracy of Doppler-assisted estimation of the wedge pressure makes it useful in the evaluation and follow-up of patients with suspected cardiac disorders. The method may assist in evaluating the effects of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, since it is sufficiently sensitive to detect acute directional changes in wedge pressure.\r"

In diabetics with a disease duration of greater than 30 yr, urinary albumin excretion rate greater than 200 micrograms/min (clinical nephropathy), proliferative retinopathy or autonomic neuropathy, both the posterior wall thickness and the septal thickness were increased compared to controls. The posterior wall thickness and the septal thickness were positively correlated to blood pressure (p less than 0.001), disease duration (p less than 0.001), urinary albumin excretion rate (p less than 0.001), and negatively correlated to the heart variation during deep respiration (p less than 0.01). The left ventricular wall mass was correlated to both blood pressure (p less than 0.01) and urinary albumin excretion rate (p less than 0.01). By multiple regression analysis urinary albumin excretion rate, disease duration and heart rate variation during deep respiration did not add significantly to the correlation between left ventricular wall mass/wall thickness and blood pressure. The septal movement was reduced in diabetics with proliferative retinopathy or clinical nephropathy. In conclusion, left ventricular wall thickness and wall mass were closely related to blood pressure in insulin-dependent diabetics. Signs of impaired cardiac function, such as reduced septal movement, were seen only in patients with severe microvascular disease.\r"

The dilatation procedure was initially performed with a small balloon to primarily dilate the stenotic valve for easier passage of a second balloon catheter and to make the procedure tolerable for severely ill patients; the procedure was then followed by two balloons to further increase the mitral valve area (MVA) for effective dilatation of the stenotic mitral orifice. The dilatation was successful in all patients; the mitral valve pressure gradient decreased from 19 +/ 6 to 5 +/ 2 mm Hg, the cardiac output increased from 4.0 +/ 0.5 to 5.2 +/ 0.6 L/min, and the MVA increased from 0.8 +/ 0.2 to 1.9 +/ 0.4 cm2 (p less than 0.01 each). The MVA after dilatation was relative to the effective balloon dilatation diameter selected (r = 0.57; p less 0.01). A small atrial septal defect was observed in 3 of 23 patients immediately after the dilatation procedure. Mild mitral regurgitation was produced in 3 of 23 patients by the dilatation. We conclude that the sequential single- and double-balloon dilatation procedure can effectively increase the MVA and improve hemodynamics in severe mitral stenosis and that the larger effective balloon diameter of 24.8 mm or more (12 +/ 18 mm of two balloons) is necessary for effective dilatation.\r"

Left ventricular systolic function was evaluated noninvasively in 37 patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) by means of peak aortic blood acceleration measured with a continuous-wave Doppler velocity meter placed suprasternally. Doppler measurements were made before, during, and immediately after balloon inflation. Nineteen patients underwent PTCA of the left anterior descending coronary artery, 15 of the right coronary artery, and three of the circumflex coronary artery. All patients had a subtotal coronary occlusion. Among the 37 patients 23 had no angiographic evidence of collaterals supplying the vessel undergoing PTCA and 14 had collaterals. In patients without collaterals peak acceleration was 16.0 +/- 3.0 m/sec/sec before balloon occlusion and decreased to 11.8 /+- 3.6 m/sec/sec within 30 to 40 seconds of coronary occlusion (p less than 0.001). After 30 to 40 seconds of reperfusion (balloon deflated), peak acceleration returned to near- preocclusion levels (17.3 +/- 7.5 m/sec/sec). Among patients with collaterals peak acceleration remained unchanged during balloon occlusion and reperfusion relative to preocclusion levels (NS). These data indicate that collaterals can preserve left ventricular function during transient coronary occlusion in humans.\r"

Fourteen patients (74%) received previous long-term combined treatment with nifedipine and nitrates. Continuous ECG monitoring was carried out until heart rate reduction and at least one of the following occurred: (1) relief of pain or (2) resolution of ischemic ECG changes. the study protocol consisted of carotid massage in three patients (16%), intravenous propranolol in seven patients (37%), slow intravenous amiodarone infusion in two patients (10%), and intravenous verapamil in four patients (21%) with atrial fibrillation. In three patients (16%) we observed a spontaneous heart rate reduction on admission. Patients responded with heart rate reduction from a mean of 125 +/- 10.4 beats/min to 84 +/- 7.5 beats/min (p less than 0.005) and an ST segment shift of 4.3 +/- 2.13 mm to 0.89 +/- 0.74 mm (p less than 0.005) within a mean interval of 13.2 +/- 12.7 minutes. Fifteen (79%) had complete response and the other four (21%) had partial relief of pain. A significant direct correlation was observed for heart rate reduction and ST segment deviation (depression or elevation) (r = 0.7527 and 0.8739, respectively). These patients represent a unique subgroup of unstable angina, in which the mechanism responsible for ischemia is excessive increase in heart rate.

In group 1 the time to the peak CK-MB was 16.2 +/- 50 hours vs 10.0 +/- 2.0 hours for group 2 (p = 0.0001). Peak CK-MB was 331 +/- 276 IU/L in group 1 vs 81 +/- 54 IU/L in group 2 (p less than 0.005). In group 1 there were 16 patients who subsequently had a Q wave myocardial infarction as opposed to one patient in group 2 (p = 0.0001). Patients who do not have diagnostic ST segment elevation on the initial ECG have an early but low peak of CK-MB and typically have a non-Q wave infarction. These findings are consistent with early spontaneous restoration of blood flow during the infarction process in these patients. This early restoration of blood flow may provide the substrate for the high incidence of recurrent ischemic events noted in patients with non-Q wave myocardial infarction.\r"

The remaining 553 patients were classified as low risk. The overall rate of complications in the coronary care unit was greater in the high-risk group, 64%, compared to 26% in the low-risk group (p less than 0.001).

The high-risk group required significantly more interventions, such as electrical cardioversion, temporary pacing, pulmonary artery catheterization, and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation, compared to the low-risk group (20% vs 2%, respectively; p less than 0.001). Myocardial infarction was confirmed in 892 patients in the high-risk group (55%) compared to 90 (16%) in the low-risk group (p less than 0.001). The coronary care unit mortality rate was greater in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group (8.2% vs 0.4%, respectively; p less than 0.0002).

To examine the prevalence of proximal vs mid and distal disease and its relationship with cardiac risk factors, we studied more than 14,000 sections from 102 hearts with coronary artery disease at autopsy. After postmortem angiography, the coronary arteries were removed, divided into proximal, mid, and distal thirds, sectioned at 2.5 mm intervals, and graded for percentage reduction in cross-sectional area by atherosclerosis. Of 252 vessels in 84 patients with greater than or equal to 75% stenosis, 166 (66%) has proximal disease vs 107 (42%) with mid disease and 40 (16%) with distal disease (p less than 0.001). No patient had a mid or distal stenosis greater than 75% without proximal disease. When atherosclerosis of any severity was assessed, proximal atherosclerotic lesions were long and diffuse, whereas distal lesions were more often short and discrete. Proximal circumflex lesions were shorter in length than those in the right or left anterior descending coronary arteries. The prevalence of proximal, mid, and distal stenoses in 25 diabetic patients was similar to that in nondiabetic persons (53%, 47%, and 17%, p greater than 0.3). Similarly, hypertension, smoking, and obesity were not associated with an increase in prevalence of distal disease. Patients with distal stenoses were younger than patients without (mean age, 64 +/- 13 vs 73 +/- 10 years, p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

With circumflex ligation, control dogs (N = 18) developed premature ventricular beats and ventricular tachycardia, followed by ventricular fibrillation (N = 16, 89%). Immediate arrhythmias (2 to 5 minutes) were accompanied by activation delays and continuous diastolic electrical activity in acutely ischemic epicardial tissue. Delayed arrhythmias (6 to 12 minutes) were accompanied by delayed activation and continuous diastolic electrical activity in acutely ischemic mid-myocardium. Nadolol (8 mg/kg, intravenously) (N = 10) reduced ventricular arrhythmias during both phases of arrhythmia development and increased survival (70%, p = 0.001 vs control). Nadolol failed to after activation in acutely ischemic epicardium, but prevented beat-to-beat changes in epicardial and mid-myocardial activation. Atrial pacing of nadolol-treated animals at heart rates comparable with those of the control group reversed the beneficial effects of nadolol on the development of ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular fibrillation (70%; p = 0.07 vs nadolol; p = 0.21 vs control, respectively). The beneficial effects of nadolol could not be attributed to reduced epicardial delays, but were associated with the suppression of beat-to-beat conduction abnormalities that preceded ventricular fibrillation.\r"

This study reflects an entirely new concept of the Mobitz type II phenomenon, wherein consecutive impulses have constant conduction times, but instead of being followed by a block of conduction, are in fact followed by a conduction delay. The diagnosis of this manifestation at the atrioventricular (AV) junction is made by the appearance of an unexpected prolonged PR interval followed by a shorter PR interval. The recognition of this manifestation at the sinoatrial junction is suggested when, during regular sinus rhythm with manifest episodes of Mobitz type II sinoatrial block, the sinus rhythm is at times also complicated by a sudden unexpected prolongation of a P-P interval, which is followed by an shortened P-P interval. This new phenomenon is termed by Mobitz type II delay.\r"

  ".W": "The conduction time of premature ventricular complexes, which are generally quite constant throughout late diastole, abruptly prolongs during repolarization as the refractory period of the ventricle is approached (conduction time breakpoint). The relationship between the conduction time breakpoint and the recovery properties of the ventricle was examined by relating the conduction time of premature ventricular complexes to the effective refractory period and the monophasic action potential derived from the ventricular suction electrode signal. In five anesthetized dogs during ventricular drive (cathode; 2.5 Hz; three times diastolic threshold), effective refractory period and conduction times of premature ventricular complexes were derived from computerized strength-interval curves. The recovery properties of the ventricle were altered by infusion of norepinephrine, calcium, and quinidine and by cooling (29 degrees to 34 degrees C). In these circumstances, the moment of conduction time breakpoint changes correlated well (r = 0.93) with the end of the negative slope of the ventricular suction electrode signal, which suggests that the conduction time breakpoint may be an indirect marker of the ventricular action potential duration. In seven additional dogs the interval between the effective refractory period and the conduction time breakpoint, which defines the relative refractory period, was increased by 5 to 8 minutes of ischemia (coincident with height of ventricular vulnerability) and was reversed by procainamide. Procainamide is known to diminish spontaneous and induced ventricular arrhythmias by reducing the disparity between the effective refractory period and the action potential duration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "89047111\r", 
  ".W": "The etiology of systolic left ventricular-to-aortic pressure gradients in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is still controversial. While cavity obliteration has been proposed by some investigators as the cause for recording of a high left ventricular systolic pressure, the concept of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction has received more experimental support. To investigate further whether left ventricular pressure truly exceeds aortic pressure and implies obstruction, we studied, with imaging and Doppler echocardiographic techniques, five patients with asymmetric septal hypertrophy and systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve occasionally causing it to abut upon the septum. All had outflow tract pressure gradients (peak 85 +/- 10 mm Hg) and trace to mild mitral regurgitation. Continuous wave Doppler study recorded peak flow velocities in the outflow tract (4.6 +/- 0.3 m/sec), and mitral regurgitant (mean 6.6 +/- 0.3 m/sec) jets. Aortic systolic and diastolic blood pressures were measured by cuff sphygmomanometry, and simultaneous carotid pulse tracings were recorded. The magnitude of systolic aortic pressure was determined at the time of peak velocity in the mitral regurgitant jet. Since the peak systolic pressure gradient across the mitral valve (left ventricular minus left atrial pressure) should equal 4 times the square of the peak velocity (V) in the mitral regurgitant jet, peak left ventricular systolic pressure should equal 4 x V2 plus the height of left atrial pressure at the time of peak mitral regurgitant velocity. In each case, calculations were made assuming an upper normal left atrial pressure of 10 mm Hg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The administration of beta-blocking agents to patients with poor left ventricular (LV) function may result in clinical and hemodynamic deterioration. The beta antagonist pindolol has intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) and therefore may be better tolerated. To test this hypothesis 30 patients with a precatheterization diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy were randomly assigned to three groups to receive intravenous injections of placebo, propranolol, or pindolol. The baseline ejection fraction and hemodynamics were similar for all groups. For propranolol 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg, and 4 mg doses were given 5 minutes apart until a maximum dose of 10 mg was reached, until a 25% reduction in the heart rate or mean arterial pressure occurred, or until clinical deterioration developed. For pindolol, 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.3 mg, and 0.4 mg boluses were used with the same end points. Baseline hemodynamics were measured and repeated 15 minutes after the last dose of each drug was administered. The mean number of doses given was similar for both groups: 3.3 doses for the propranolol group and 3.4 for the pindolol group. Compared to propranolol, pindolol caused less of a reduction in heart rate, cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and stroke work index and less of an increase in the mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary arterial pressure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, and pulmonary vascular resistance; there was a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. These differences were statistically significant for changes in heart rate, right atrial pressure, cardiac index, and systemic vascular resistance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Noninvasive determination of these relationships has been performed in normal subjects and has been found to reflect baseline and drug-induced changes in ventricular contractility. Three late systolic indices of ventricular contractility were noninvasively determined in subjects with chronic congestive heart failure to determine the feasibility of the method and to assess the linearity and slopes of the relationships in this population. All relations were linear with individual correlation coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.99. The mean +/- SD slope was 42.8 +/- 26.4 mm Hg/cm for the end-systolic pressure-dimension relation, 0.59 +/- .42 mm Hg/ml for the end-systolic pressure-volume relation, and 48.7 +/- 32.2 mm Hg/cm for the peak systolic pressure-end-systolic dimension relation. All slopes were markedly reduced compared to those reported in normal individuals. The relative degree of depression was greater for the pressure-volume slope than for the pressure-dimension slope, which is explained by the relationship between volume and dimension in dilated ventricles. These data indicate that measurement of late systolic indices of ventricular contractility by this noninvasive technique is feasible in subjects with congestive heart failure and yields reduced slopes consistent with the diminished contractile state of this population. Pressure-volume rather than pressure-dimension relations may more accurately reflect inotropic state in dilated ventricles.\r"

Two-dimensional echocardiography prior to the contrast studies was able to delineate the aneurysms in 7 of 12 (58%). The contrast studies outlined two additional aneurysms. The right aneurysms directed anteriorly and caudally. The noncoronary aneurysms formed an extraneous lumen at the posterior part of the aortic root, mimicking aortic dissection. Doppler examinations showed systolic and diastolic turbulence in five of six (83%) of the right aneurysms rupturing into the right ventricular outflow tract. Color Doppler echocardiography showed a left ventricular diastolic turbulence emanating from the aneurysm in a case with a noncoronary aneurysm rupturing into the left ventricle. It is concluded that the principal Doppler, contrast, and two-dimensional echocardiographic features usually allow a rapid correct diagnosis of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.\r"

The factor(s) that effect short-term changes in this interval are unknown. Accordingly, we altered pulmonary artery pressure with phenylephrine and nitroprusside to achieve three peak pressures at low, medium, and high levels in each of 10 normal patients. Simultaneous biplane right ventricular volumes, high-fidelity pulmonary artery and right ventricular pressures, and pulmonary artery flow/velocity were obtained at each condition. After pharmacologic autonomic blockade (atropine and propranolol) at a constant heart rate achieved with atrial pacing (93 beats/min), peak pulmonary artery pressures differed significantly at low, medium, and high loading conditions (23 +/- 3 vs 31 +/- 7 vs 42 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). No associated significant change occurred in the preejection period (109 +/- 24 vs 98 +/- 14 vs 106 +/- 21 msec) and right ventricular ejection time (298 +/- 24 vs 318 +/- 23 vs 316 +/- 24 msec). The hangout interval differed significantly at each loading condition (43 +/- 16 vs 34 +/- 13 vs 23 +/- 6 msec, p less than 0.01) and correlated inversely with both the peak pulmonary artery pressure (r = -0.53, p less than 0.01) and the right ventricular end-systolic pressure (r = -0.56, p less than 0.01). In contrast, the hangout interval and right ventricular ejection time were not linearly related.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In a prospective epidemiologic study we followed 944 consecutive patients undergoing open-heart surgery between November 1984 and November 1985. The overall incidence was 17.8%. The incidence was increased in younger patients, in those with a history of prednisone use in the past, in patients with a past history of pericarditis, those with aortic valve replacement, and in patients who received enflurane or halothane anesthesia. PPS is a common syndrome. Knowledge of risk factors associated with PPS may allow its prevention and identification of patients who warrant early and aggressive treatment.\r"

All three patients had atrioventricular concordance, ventriculoatrial concordance, dextrocardia, superoinferior ventricles, crisscross atrioventricular relations, underdevelopment of the right ventricle, a large ventricular septal defect, and an inverted tetralogy of Fallot type of malformation of the infundibulum and great arteries. The condition known as crisscross atrioventricular relations was found in these three patients to be a major ventricular malposition characterized by marked clockwise rotation of the ventricles, as seen from the front. Two of these three cases were diagnosed accurately and repaired successfully.\r"

  ".W": "After 70 years of regular use, quinidine remains one of the most useful drugs in the management of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Quinidine sulfate, from conventional dosage forms, is absorbed rapidly and reaches peak levels in 1 hour. Sustained-release quinidine sulfate and gluconate are absorbed more slowly and, thus, may provide a more satisfactory response with less fluctuation in the peak and trough at quinidine concentrations. The half-life and absorption characteristics of sustained-release quinidine suggest that an 8- to 12-hour dosage regimen will produce smooth, sustained quinidine levels. Whereas quinidine and digitalis have been used concomitantly for years, dramatic elevations in blood digoxin levels have been observed. When quinidine is added to the regimen of a patient taking digitalis, these increased digoxin levels may be responsible for some of the adverse effects previously attributed to quinidine administration and can be reduced by adjustment of the digoxin dosage. Drug monitoring of serum quinidine concentrations as well as peak levels is essential to assess patient compliance and to determine that therapeutic levels are maintained. This is especially important because of the drug's relatively narrow therapeutic index and the changes in clearance that can result from drug interactions and renal and hepatic disturbances. A personal computer program is available to carry out pharmacokinetic calculations and assist in determining appropriate doses for individual patients.\r"

Patients were evaluated during post-infarction treadmill, other activities that included mental stress and cold pressor challenge, and with stress thallium imaging and cardiac catheterization. Of the 35 patients evaluated, 14 had ischemic responses on treadmill testing and 21 had negative responses. By contrast, 20 had redistribution by thallium imaging suggesting ischemia. Vest studies demonstrated 56 responses suggestive of ischemia in 23 patients. Twenty-two occurred during exercise and 13 with mental stress. Seventy-five percent were silent and only 39% had associated electrocardiographic changes. Vest responses were compared in patients whose thallium scan was indicative of ischemia (thallium-positive) and those without ischemia (thallium-negative). Ejection fraction was higher in the thallium-positive group (0.52 +/- 0.11), as compared with thallium-negative patients (0.44 +/- 0.1). With exercise, ejection fraction decreased for the thallium-positive patients from 0.52 +/- 0.11 to 0.40 +/- 0.09 at peak exercise. For thallium-negative patients, ejection fraction changes were not significant. During mental stress, ejection fraction decreased from 0.51 +/- 0.11 to 0.45 +/- 0.12 for thallium-positive patients while thallium-negative patients were unchanged. Vest-measured decreases in ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 5 units during exercise were highly sensitive (90%), specific (73%) and predictive (82%) of a positive thallium scan. The same response for mental stress was specific (87%) and predictive (85%) of a positive scan result.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In 74 (57%) of the 129 patients, the 2 infarcts were opposite one another, in 40 (31%) they were adjacent and in 15 (12%) they were both opposite and adjacent. The age, sex, mean size of the healed infarct and heart weight were similar among the 3 groups. Acute myocardial infarcts were larger in the group that had both opposite and adjacent infarcts than either of the other 2 groups (p less than 0.001). Information regarding whether the infarcts were clinically recognized or not was available in 108 patients: both infarcts were recognized in 41 (38%), neither infarct was recognized in 15 (14%) and 1 infarct was recognized and the other was not in 52 (48%). The number of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries narrowed at some point greater than 75% in cross-sectional area by atherosclerotic plaque was similar in patients with recognized and in those with unrecognized infarcts. Similar numbers of narrowed major epicardial coronary arteries also were found in each of the 3 infarct groups (opposite, adjacent or both).\r"

Accordingly, coronary angiography was performed 5 +/- 2 days after qualifying rest pain in 101 consecutive patients presenting with acute coronary insufficiency (n = 67) or crescendo angina (n = 34). Significant coronary artery disease was defined as any greater than or equal to 50% stenosis, and complex morphology as any stenosis with irregularity, overhang or thrombus. Eight of the 67 patients presenting with acute coronary insufficiency later proved to have a myocardial infarction as the qualifying event (creatine kinase twice normal with elevation of MB fraction). There were no myocardial infarctions in the crescendo angina group. Complex morphology occurred in 61% of patients. Thrombus alone occurred in 27% of patients with unstable angina without myocardial infarction, with similar frequencies between the 2 clinical groups. In contrast, intraluminal thrombi were identified in 78% of patients with acute coronary insufficiency who later proved to have a myocardial infarction as the qualifying event. The need for urgent catheterization (less than 48 hours) prompted by recurrent symptoms was associated with the angiographic findings of intraluminal thrombus (46%) and complex morphology (83%). The presence of complex morphology and intracoronary thrombus was associated with a higher incidence of in-hospital cardiac events, i.e., revascularization, myocardial infarction and death, independent of the incidence of multivessel disease.\r"

  ".W": "Esmolol is a rapidly metabolized cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker that provides steady state beta-adrenergic blockade when administered by continuous intravenous infusion. To determine the efficacy of esmolol in the management of unstable angina, 23 patients with known coronary artery disease, who averaged 3.7 +/- 2.7 daily episodes of chest pain at rest, were randomized to receive either a continuous infusion of esmolol (n = 12) or oral propranolol (n = 11), as an adjunct to concomitant antianginal therapy. Patients with systolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg, heart rate less than 60 beats/min or known contraindications to beta blockade were excluded. Esmolol was titrated in a step-wise fashion from 2 to 24 mg/min at 5-minute intervals up to a 30% reduction in heart rate and systolic blood pressure double-product. The propranolol dose was increased every 6 hours by 50 to 100% to achieve a similar reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. When compared with their 24-hour baseline periods, both groups achieved a significant reduction in episodes of chest pain, from 4.6 +/- 3.3 to 1.4 +/- 1.5 in the esmolol group (p less than 0.02) and 2.6 +/- 1.4 to 1.0 +/- 1.5 in the propranolol group (p less than 0.02) during the subsequent study period. The cardiac event rate and incidence of drug side effects were similar between the 2 groups; however, side effects seen with esmolol did not require treatment after drug discontinuation. Thus, maximally tolerated beta blockade is an effective therapy for unstable angina.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Using continuous 3-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings in 19 patients undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary artery angioplasty (PTCA) of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, this study described the dynamic changes of the ST segment and the R- and S-wave amplitudes that occur during transient myocardial ischemia. The waveforms from lead V2 were quantified at 10-second intervals during the length of the balloon inflation that produced the greatest extent of ST-segment deviation. The simultaneous changes that occurred in leads aVF and V5 were also observed, but not quantified. Measurements of R- and S-wave amplitudes were performed during maximal ischemia from both the PR- and the J-ST-segment baselines to determine which of these most nearly maintained its control position during ischemia. The results indicate that the R-wave amplitude is best determined from the PR-segment baseline (p = 0.0007), while the S wave is best determined from the J-ST-segment baseline (p = 0.03). However, only a portion of the QRS changes observed during PTCA could be accounted for by the baseline shift. There were additional QRS changes during ischemia in 11 of the patients (58%) suggestive of conduction disturbances in 3 endocardial sites: left septal, right septal and left anterosuperior. It is hypothesized that these changes may represent ischemia-induced delay in conduction (\"periischemic block\") previously thought to occur only with myocardial infarction.\r"

  ".W": "The ability of heart rate (HR) correction of exercise-induced ST-segment depression (the delta ST/HR index) to reduce the number of false positive exercise electrocardiograms during initial screening for occult coronary artery disease (CAD) was examined in active, asymptomatic men from the Army Reserve. Among 606 consecutive men given treadmill tests, 62 asymptomatic subjects with normal results on resting electrocardiograms but abnormal outcomes on standard exercise electrocardiograms underwent rest and exercise radionuclide cineangiography, and the 10 subjects with abnormal radionuclide findings then underwent coronary angiography. A previously established delta ST/HR index less than 1.6 microV/beat/min correctly identified 34 of 52 subjects (65%) who, despite abnormal standard exercise electrocardiographic findings, had no rest or exercise radionuclide abnormalities. A delta ST/HR index greater than or equal to 1.6 microV/beta/min detected 7 of 7 subjects with abnormal radionuclide cineangiograms who had CAD at cardiac catheterization, but also identified 2 of 3 subjects with an abnormal radionuclide test who had no CAD. In contrast to the 7 of 62 subjects (11%) with abnormal standard exercise test criteria who had radionuclide and angiographic evidence of CAD, a delta ST/HR index partition of 1.6 microV/beat/min separated subjects into subgroups with 0% (0 of 35) vs 26% (7 of 27) prevalences of CAD by serial diagnostic evaluation (p less than 0.01). Thus, among asymptomatic subjects with abnormal electrocardiographic responses to exercise, simple HR correction of the magnitude of ST-segment depression reduced by 56% the number of subjects with standard exercise test criteria leading to referral for additional diagnostic evaluation, without loss of sensitivity for angiographically proven CAD and with accurate negative predictive value.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Our purpose was to assess factors affecting TTI in humans. Twenty-eight patients undergoing elective cardioversion were monitored up to 48 hours after shock delivery. We also studied 10 normal subjects, who did not receive shocks, for comparison. TTI declined 8% in the first hour in patients who received shocks, but also 6% in the normal subjects who wore the same pads for 1 hour but received no shocks. Twenty-four hours later, TTI returned to baseline in the nonshocked subjects but remained reduced (93% of control, p less than 0.05) in the shocked patients. There was a correlation between the total energy delivered and the decline in TTI (r = 0.69). TTI was 9% lower at end-expiration than at end-inspiration (55 +/- 3 vs 50 +/- 3 ohms, mean +/- standard error of the mean, p less than 0.01, paired t test). In the normal subjects, when a nonsalt-containing coupling agent (ultrasound coupling gel) was compared with a salt-containing gel (Redux paste), TTI was 20% higher (65 +/- 5 vs 54 +/- 4 ohms, p less than 0.01) with the nonsalt-containing gel. When no coupling agent was used, TTI was markedly higher, 160 +/- 18 ohms (p less than 0.01 vs control). After 1 hour, TTI decreased 6% in the normal subjects when salt-containing gel was used, but did not change when a nonsalt gel was used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred office patients (all men) with BPs less than 140/90 mm Hg, ages 28 to 79 years, who had little or no heart disease and were not taking medication, had BPs taken at rest and during treadmill and handgrip dynamometer. Within 14 years, 16 subjects developed hypertension and 84 remained normotensive. Multivariate statistical comparisons for systolic and diastolic BPs and their interactions were used to discriminate between later hypertensive and normotensive subjects. The best single predictor was resting diastolic BP, classifying 88% of hypertensive and 69% of normotensive subjects correctly, followed closely by handgrip and treadmill diastolic BP and resting, treadmill and handgrip systolic BP. The best prediction was by the interaction between resting diastolic BP X handgrip diastolic BP; this classified 88% of hypertensive and 80% of normotensive subjects correctly. Of the few known precursors of hypertension, high BP at rest and during dynamic and isometric stress provides a means of alerting to careful follow-up and early treatment.\r"

Spironolactone was prescribed at a mean dose of 98 mg, hydrochlorothiazide at 36 mg and cyclothiazide at 2 mg, during a mean follow-up of 20 months. Compared with the pretherapeutic values, BP decreased equally in both treatment groups (18/9 mm Hg on average). Creatinine increased significantly in the 3 groups (9, 8, 14 mumol/liter, p less than 0.001) as did uric acid (18, 31, 42 mumol, p less than 0.001). Plasma potassium increased with spironolactone (0.7 mmol/liter, p less than 0.001) and remained stable with the combinations of the thiazide-potassium-sparing agents. For the 3 groups, the slight and nonsignificant variations of fasting blood glucose and cholesterol were mainly the results of a phenomenon of regression to the mean. However, when both groups of thiazide-treated patients were considered, the reduction of plasma potassium was accompanied by a slight increase in glucose (0.1 mmol/liter) and cholesterol levels (0.2 mmol/liter) compared with when kalemia decreased (-0.1 and -0.1 mmol/liter, respectively, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.05). It is concluded that in a clinical daily practice of a hypertension clinic low doses of spironolactone or of thiazides combined with potassium-sparing agents reduced BP without alteration in lipid or carbohydrate metabolism on long-term follow-up.\r"

However, the duration of this hemodynamic and clinical improvement is uncertain. Forty-two patients were followed for 10.2 +/- 0.5 months. Balloon valvuloplasty caused dramatic immediate reduction in the number of patients with moderate or severe dyspnea (80 to 14%), moderate or severe angina (39 to 2%) and syncope (30 to 2%). Furthermore, this improvement in symptoms continued for the duration of the follow-up period in most patients. Echocardiographic aortic valve mean gradient and area determined at 3-month intervals, however, showed a trend toward or return to prevalvuloplasty levels by 9 months' follow-up in 13 of 25 patients (52%), whereas 12 of 25 patients showed no deterioration in their hemodynamic parameters. This trend toward restenosis was accompanied by symptomatic deterioration in 5 of 13 patients (38%). This tendency toward restenosis in greater than 50% of patients by 9 months underscores the need for further technical improvements if balloon valvuloplasty is to be widely applied. Even with these limitations, however, balloon valvuloplasty seems to provide a significant improvement in actuarial survival compared with the natural history of elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis.\r"

Left ventricular outflow tract gradients were estimated using either Doppler or M-mode echocardiography. Gradients were measured before treatment, after acute and chronic dosing, after washout and after rechallenge. Disopyramide serum levels were measured at the time of echocardiography. With the first dose, mean outflow gradient decreased from 64 to 14 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001). This decrease in gradient was still present after long-term oral treatment 23 days later, with a mean gradient of 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). After withdrawal from the drug, gradient returned to the pretreatment value, 79 mm Hg. After rechallenge, the gradient once again declined to 30 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). High disopyramide serum levels correlated with lower outflow tract gradients, r = -0.77 (p less than 0.0001). Even at low therapeutic drug levels, there was a 49% reduction in outflow tract gradient. Four patients were symptomatically improved and have been maintained on disopyramide for greater than 1 year. In symptomatic patients, disopyramide acutely decreases obstruction and also provides sustained pharmacologic control of obstruction. Disopyramide should be considered as a good alternative to treatment with adrenergic blockers, calcium antagonists or surgery.\r"

Thirty-one 12-mm and six 17-mm diameter devices were successfully placed in the ductus (internal diameter average 3.9 mm, range 2 to 9 mm). One procedure was abandoned when fluoroscopy failed to visualize the device. There were 2 immediate embolizations subjected to surgical recovery. A residual shunt was present on the immediate postocclusion ventriculogram in 12 of 37 procedures (32%). Twenty-eight patients (75%) have had at least a follow-up at 3 months with Doppler study and 6 (21%) continued to have shunting into the pulmonary artery. Three of 4 patients have undergone successful placement of a second device and 1 patient's shunting spontaneously resolved at 1 year postimplant, leaving only 2 patients (7%) with persistent shunts. There has been 1 episode of probable prosthetic endarteritis and 1 patient has developed mild narrowing of the left pulmonary artery related to device placement. Catheter occlusion of the patent ductus arteriosus using the Rashkind umbrella appears to be a safe and effective method of non-surgical management.\r"

M-mode echocardiograms of the aortic valve, mitral valve and left ventricle were obtained and digitized at baseline and with each pacing rate. With increased atrial pacing, left ventricular systolic time became an increasingly greater proportion of cycle length while the diastolic filling period occupied a lesser proportion of the cycle length. The time to peak filling rate and the rapid filling period occupied a greater proportion of the diastolic filling period. The peak filling rate increased progressively with increased atrial pacing (baseline 128 +/- 19 mm/s, first paced rate 146 +/- 27 mm/s, p less than 0.05 vs baseline; second paced rate 167 +/- 23 mm/s, p less than 0.01 vs baseline and first paced rate). The early diastolic filling fraction and rapid filling fraction also increased with pacing. Increasing the heart rate resulted in an alteration of the time course of diastolic filling and extent of diastolic filling during the rapid filling period. Interventions that improve diastolic filling and increase heart rate may in part be due to heart rate changes.\r"

During 15 +/- 9 (range 3 to 24) months of follow-up, there were 23 ischemic events (2 fatal reinfarctions, 6 nonfatal reinfarctions and 16 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, 1 after reinfarction) and 11 arrhythmic events (7 symptomatic ventricular tachycardias and 4 sudden cardiac deaths). Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that out of 11 variables, including exercise testing, late potentials and clinical data, exercise testing was the only independent variable predicting the occurrence of ischemic events (p less than 0.05 not including coronary artery bypass grafting and p less than 0.002 including it). Arrhythmic events were predicted, in order of importance, by Killip class (p less than 0.05), late potentials (p less than 0.005), previous AMI (p less than 0.009), occurrence of in-hospital complications (p less than 0.005) and non-Q-wave AMI (p less than 0.02). The presence of late potentials provided independent prognostic information from the Killip class and the result of exercise testing in predicting both arrhythmic and ischemic events. Exercise testing, late potentials and clinical assessment provide complementary prognostic information in postinfarction patients.\r"

The authors were disappointed in their failure to find relationships between the diets and serum cholesterol of the individual men. Their report gives mean values for calories, diet fatty acids, and serum cholesterol for the men grouped by areas of birth. Regression analysis shows highly significant relations of serum cholesterol means to means of diet fatty acids for areas of birth. The relations found conform closely to expectations from dietary experiments in metabolic wards. Failure to consider intraindividual relations in the variables explains the disappointment of the authors of the report on the Israelis. Similar lack of attention to intraindividual variability is frequent in surveys and epidemiological studies and leads to error, controversy, and waste of time and money.\r"

During 1 y of follow-up the rate of diarrhea (per 100 wk) in children less than 6 y in the intervention group was 5.89 episodes whereas that in the nonintervention group was 7.55 episodes (protective efficacy 22%; p less than 0.0001). During the same follow-up period children in both groups exhibited comparable patterns of weight gain; 1 y after the intervention the mean weight for age of children in both groups was 76% of the NCHS standard. No significant differences were observed in the proportion of each group that experienced a major deterioration or improvement of nutritional status. We conclude that an intervention that reduces rates of childhood diarrhea may not necessarily also improve nutritional status.\r"

Nine patients died. Pearson correlation analysis demonstrated that death was significantly (p less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) associated with sepsis, serum albumin less than 30 g/L, TLC less than or equal to 1500 cells/mm3, and percentage IBW less than or equal to 90%. However, when serum albumin was controlled for, logit regression analyses demonstrated that the impact of other nutritional indices on death was insignificant. The effect of serum albumin remained significant (p less than 0.05 to less than 0.01) even when age and physician's diagnosis were held constant. With the logit model, serum albumin greater than or equal to 30 g/L had a sensitivity of 0.33, specificity of 0.99, and overall predictive power of 0.91. Serum albumin is thus the simplest and best single predictor of mortality and can provide early identification of elderly people at increased risk of death.\r"

This study examined the ability to predict body composition variables from girth measurements in obese women. Girth measurements were taken on 156 obese women at abdomen 1 and abdomen 2 (mean value of the two was used), buttocks, and right thigh. Stepwise multiple-regression analysis generated on 110 randomly assigned subjects yielded the following equations: density (g/cc) = -0.00020(mean abdomen) - 0.00032(wt) + 0.00039(ht) + 0.97783 (R = 0.76, SEE = +/- 0.00061); % fat = 0.11077(mean abdomen) - 0.17666(ht) + 0.14354(wt) + 51.03301 (R = 0.76, SEE = +/- 2.9); fat wt (kg) = 0.62039(wt) - 0.17844(ht) + 0.09495(mean abdomen) + 5.88874 (R = 0.96, SEE = +/- 2.9); and lean body wt (kg) = 0.37939(wt) + 0.17898(ht) - 0.09494(mean abdomen) - 6.00423 (R = 0.89, SEE = +/- 3.0). Data from the remaining 46 women were used for cross-validation. These equations were valid, with validity coefficients for fat weight and lean body weight of r = 0.92 (SE = +/- 3.3 kg) and r = 0.86 (SE = +/- 3.3 kg), respectively, with no significant mean differences between actual and predicted values. The use of girth measurements is a simple and practical method of estimating fat weight and lean body weight in obese women.\r"

The three related measures of resistance (R), reactance (Xc), and impedance (Z) were found to follow very similar patterns throughout the fast, increasing for the first 7 d and remaining stable for the second 7 d. Weight loss averaged 10 kg and R increased whereas height squared divided by resistance (ht2/R) decreased during the fast with opposite changes during refeeding. Changes in resistance were significantly greater during the first week of fasting than during the second. With the exception of the subject who was the most obese, changes in ht2/R correlated well with changes in TBW (r = 0.94). It is concluded that bioelectrical impedance measurements accurately reflect changes in TBW during a 2-wk fast.\r"

Agreement between measured and predicted 24-h EE was within +/- 2% for group results and +/- 10% for most individuals. Individual agreement was improved to within +/- 5% by using measured rather than predicted BMR. Habitual energy intake was 7.3% greater (p less than 0.05) than predicted EE in males and 5.1% less (NS) in females. Validatory data suggested overrecording of intake in males and underrecording in females. Large individual differences between habitual intake and predicted EE were observed but were significantly (p less than 0.01) correlated with both weight change and protein balance. Our simple factorial method provided acceptable estimates of EE in the subjects studied.\r"

Fasting blood samples were taken on days 0 (base line), 14, and 28 and were analyzed for triglycerides (TGs) and cholesterol. By the end of Ramadan, body weight, blood TGs, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-chol) had decreased significantly (p less than 0.05), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-chol) had increased, and total cholesterol had not changed compared with base-line values. The variance in blood lipid levels was explained by weight change through linear and curvilinear regression models. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the contrasting results reported by various investigators and they may be useful in regulating blood lipid levels through Ramadan fasting.\r"

The preschool children of 24 villages with a population of approximately 11,000 were divided into five control and intervention groups. The interventions consisted of a village health program, high-calorie snacks, and vitamin-mineral supplements. The supplements when used were provided in day care centers for preschool children. The health and nutrition interventions used did not significantly affect growth during the study period reported from December 1981 to October 1983. Monthly changes in length and weight observed in this and a previous study indicate that growth patterns in Thai children are different from those seen in industrialized societies. Factors other than lack of nutrients and infection may be responsible for the inadequate growth often reported in developing countries.\r"

Allowing for the major anthropometric, dietary, medical, and psychological determinants of blood pressure in multivariate regression analyses, both plasma ascorbic acid (p = 0.0008) and serum selenium (p = 0.0017) concentrations had a moderate, independent inverse association, estimated dietary intake of saturated fatty acids had a positive association (p = 0.013), and estimated dietary intake of linolenic acid had an inverse (p = 0.048) association with the mean resting blood pressure. The marked elevation of blood pressure at the lowest levels of plasma ascorbic acid and serum Se concentrations supports the hypothesis that antioxidants play a role in the etiology of hypertension.\r"

Pancreatic insufficiency was as severe in patients as in control subjects in Dakar. After a well-balanced diet was fed for 5 d, all kwashiorkor symptoms disappeared. In Abidjan pancreatic secretion levels increased but remained lower than in control subjects. After 28 d feeding, the pancreatic secretion of kwashiorkor patients in Dakar was not modified. Pancreatic extracts had no effect on changes in pancreatic insufficiency after feeding. In West Africa there is a latent pancreatic insufficiency involving water, electrolytes, and enzymes, which is more severe in Dakar, where, in contrast to Abidjan, it is neither aggravated by kwashiorkor nor corrected by feeding.\r"

We assessed the effect of phytate removal from soy formula on Zn absorption using infant rhesus monkeys and suckling rat pups as animal models. Zn absorption in monkeys, as determined by whole-body counting, was 65% from human milk, 54% from monkey milk, 60% from whey-predominant formula, 46% from casein-predominant formula, and only 27% from conventional soy formula (0.621 mmol phytate/L). In contrast, Zn absorption from dephytinized soy formula (0.067 mmol phytate/L) was 45%. In suckling rats, Zn absorption from conventional soy formula was only 16% vs 47% from dephytinized soy formula. Phytate concentration in a variety of experimental soy formulas was inversely correlated to Zn absorption. These results suggest that the low bioavailability of Zn from soy formula is a function of its phytate concentration and can be overcome by the removal of phytate.\r"

For this reason, we included in the study 30 patients whose food-allergic history had been proven through double-blind challenge tests; 20 healthy volunteers also were included as controls. The patients and volunteers underwent standard laboratory investigations and allergy tests with PRICK and RAST. To observe possible mucosal reactions, we applied the proposed allergens via endoscope to the gastric mucosa. Macroscopic reactions were observed blindly by two independent physicians. Biopsies were taken from the challenged areas for histological and histochemical analysis. The examinations included the estimations of tissue histamine concentrations and of mast cell and lymphocyte counts. In all 30 patients, macroscopic reactions (swelling, erosions, bleedings) were observed. Patients with food allergy had, in contrast to healthy volunteers, elevated lymphocyte counts, tissue histamine concentrations, and mast cell counts. After provocation, tissue histamine concentrations and mast cell counts fell significantly. Skin and RAST tests showed positive results in only 46.7% and 50.0%, respectively, of food-allergic patients. We conclude, first, that through intragastric provocation under endoscopic control (IPEC), food-allergic reactions on the mucosa of the GI tract can be verified and, second, that the liberation of tissue histamine seems to play an important role in the establishment of food-allergic reactions on the mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "We present a prospective, unrandomized, uncontrolled series of 1272 patients in whom endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) was performed, and who had not previously undergone cholecystectomy. These patients were culled from our combined experience of a total of 4177 patients in whom ES was performed over the last 13 yr. Of the group reported here, 1208 patients had demonstrable gallbladder stones, and 64 had acalculous gallbladders. The group included 896 females and 396 males whose mean age was 73.3 yr and who ranged from 17 to 101 yr old. Cholangitis was present in 317 patients (25%), and gallstone pancreatitis in 134 (10.5%) patients. After sphincterotomy, 109 patients (8.6%) developed cholecystitis; 23 developed this within 48 h, and 86 developed this within 10 days of the procedure. Emergency surgery was performed on 25 of these patients, and 84 responded to medical therapy alone. Two deaths occurred within 30 days of sphincterotomy (0.15%), in both cases following emergency surgery in elderly patients. One hundred-eight patients underwent elective cholecystectomy within 3 yr of their sphincterotomy because of recurrent symptoms referrable to the biliary tract. In a subset of 337 patients in whom long-term followup was possible, two patients died of complications related to recurrent cholecystitis, both at approximately 2 yr after sphincterotomy. Although followup was less than optimal in this large series of patients, the data presented here suggest that an intact gallbladder is not a contraindication to ES in the management of common bile duct stones, and that the morbidity and mortality of ES compare favorably over the long and short term with surgical management.\r"

Patients with malabsorption after the 12.5-g dose were tested further with 250 ml of milk. In the total group of patients and in the subgroup of those with resection, the prevalence of malabsorption was higher than in controls at all lactose loads; in patients who had not undergone resection, no significant difference was observed with the 12.5-g dose. Eleven of 18 patients who were malabsorbers with the 12.5-g dose had malabsorption also with 250 ml milk; however, only three of them (8% of the total group) experienced symptoms of intolerance. We conclude that, in adult patients with CD, 1) the prevalence of lactose malabsorption is increased, 2) in patients who have undergone intestinal resection, malabsorption occurs at a lower dose of the sugar than in patients who did not, and 3) since only 8% of patients experienced symptoms of intolerance after the ingestion of milk 250 ml, this amount can be empirically inserted in the daily diet of an adult with CD.\r"

This patient presented with episodes of recurrent severe right lower abdominal pain, each episode separated by several uneventful months. The diagnosis was made by radiological visualization of a polypoid lesion with a dimple at the top in the caput cecum, and by the endoscopic appearance of the polypoid mass. A sessile polypoid mass (about 1 cm) that looked like foreskin and glans was observed by colonoscopy. The dimple at the top, like glans, was partially reddish, and the steeply sloped surface, like foreskin turned inside out, was smooth. The area of dimple at the top became discernibly smaller and the appearance changed as air was led into cecum. Appendectomy was without untoward events, and the patient no longer experienced such episodes. Although intussusception of the appendix is rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal syndrome.\r"

The surrounding extracellular matrix contains several glycoproteins and collagens that may affect the immune interactions of antigens and antibodies and may possibly influence the disposition of immune complexes. These properties may modulate the consequences of deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes in the mesangium in patients with IgA nephropathy and the consequent expression of clinical disease.\r"

Monomeric IgA antidinitrophenyl (DNP) and the antigen DNP-Ficoll tended to form small soluble complexes that circulated in the blood without localizing in glomeruli of experimental animals. In contrast, polymeric IgA formed intermediate and large-sized complexes that caused glomerular immune deposits. Although covalently cross-linked large-sized IgA oligomers deposited in the glomeruli, they failed to induce concomitant deposition of complement components. Only the presence of a complement-activating antigen endowed the glomerular IgA immune deposits with the ability to activate complement. Thus, the size of the IgA complexes plays a primary role in initiating glomerular localization, and the nature of the antigen causes a secondary phase of inflammation.\r"

  ".U": "89047421\r", 
  ".W": "The origin of the mesangial IgA1 in primary IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is unknown. The bone marrow, the prime production site of plasma IgA in healthy humans, has not been previously investigated in patients with IgAN. In patients with IgAN, we found an increased percentage of IgA plasma cells containing IgA1 in the bone marrow (89.7% +/- 2.6% v 84.3% +/- 6.6%, P = 0.01), an increased percentage of serum IgA as IgA1 (92.2% +/- 4.9% v 80.2% +/- 6.6%, P less than 0.001), and an increased percentage of IgA1 of the IgA produced by peripheral blood lymphocytes in culture (75% +/- 16% v 54% +/- 19%, P less than 0.01). These findings are compatible with the bone marrow as production site of the mesangial IgA1. The data on IgA1 polymers are more difficult to interpret because their role in the pathogenesis of IgAN is still controversial. We found an increased concentration of both polymeric and monomeric IgA1 in the sera and supernatants of cultures of bone marrow of patients, although the ratio of polymeric to total IgA1 remained normal. In our opinion, the mucosa of the digestive tract is an unlikely source of the mesangial IgA because the absence of IgA2 in the deposits contrasts to the high percentage of IgA2 plasma cells in the intestinal mucosae. Moreover, in normal individuals, the digestive mucosae contribute very little to plasma IgA. Although the respiratory tract contains a higher percentage of IgA1 plasma cells, the 25% fraction of IgA plasma cells containing IgA2 is still very substantial. This percentage argues against the respiratory mucosae as a source of the mesangial IgA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), a disorder manifesting the severe brain malformation lissencephaly (\"smooth brain\"), is caused, in the majority of cases, by a chromosomal microdeletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 17. Using human chromosome 17-specific DNA probes, we have begun a molecular dissection of the critical region for MDS. To localize cloned DNA sequences to the MDS critical region, a human-rodent somatic cell hybrid panel was constructed which includes hybrids containing the abnormal chromosome 17 from three MDS patients with deletions of various sizes. Three genes (myosin heavy chain 2, tumor antigen p53, and RNA polymerase II) previously mapped to 17p were excluded from the MDS deletion region and therefore are unlikely to play a role in its pathogenesis. In contrast, three highly polymorphic anonymous probes, YNZ22.1 (D17S5), YNH37.3 (D17S28), and 144-D6 (D17S34), were deleted in each of four patients with visible deletions, including one with a ring chromosome 17 that is deleted for a portion of the single telomeric prometaphase subband p13.3. In two MDS patients with normal chromosomes, a combination of somatic cell hybrid, RFLP, and densitometric studies demonstrated deletion for YNZ22.1 and YNH37.3 in the paternally derived 17's of both patients, one of whom is also deleted for 144-D6. The results indicate that MDS can be caused by submicroscopic deletion and raises the possibility that all MDS patients will prove to have deletions at a molecular level. The two probes lie within a critical region of less than 3,000 kb and constitute potential starting points in the isolation of genes implicated in the severe brain maldevelopment in MDS.\r"

Using three highly polymorphic DNA probes (pYNZ22, pYNH37.3, and p144D6) we have detected microdeletions in three MDS patients, two of whom had no visible abnormalities of chromosome 17. Loci defined by two of the DNA probes, pYNZ22 and pYNH37.3, were deleted in all three patients. The most distal locus, defined by p144D6, was present in one MDS patient, possibly defining the distal limits of the MDS region in band 17p13.3.

Twenty-two patients (81%) had normal chromosome studies with no detectable deletion in chromosome 22. Five patients (18%) had demonstrable chromosome abnormalities. Three patients had monosomy 22q11, one due to a 4q;22q translocation, one due to a 20q;22q translocation, and one due to an interstitial deletion of 22q11. One patient had monosomy 10p13, and one patient had monosomy 18q21.33, although the latter had subsequent resolution of T-cell defects. These findings are consistent with the heterogeneity of DiGeorge anomaly but confirm the association with monosomy 22q11 in some cases. However, monosomy 10p13 may also lead to this phenotype. Because of these associated chromosome findings, cytogenetic analyses should be done on patients with suspected DiGeorge anomaly. This is particularly important since many of the abnormalities involving chromosome 22 are translocations that can be familial with a higher recurrence risk. Since only one subtle, interstitial deletion of chromosome 22 was observed, it is not clear whether high-resolution cytogenetic analysis is cost beneficial for all such patients.\r"

  ".W": "Analysis of the cytoskeletal components of early murine embryos has detected expression of two keratin proteins, K#8 and K#18, at the 4-8-cell stage. Comparable data for human embryos do not exist, although several processed pseudogenes corresponding to K#8 and K#18 have been discovered in the human genome. Because only genes that are expressed in pre-germ-line and germ-line cells can give rise to processed pseudogenes, the existence of human K#8 and K#18 processed pseudogenes is prima facie evidence for expression of keratins K#8 and K#18 in the early human embryo. We have cloned and determined the complete sequence of a processed pseudogene corresponding to another acidic human keratin. Comparison of its sequence with known sequences of other mammalian keratins indicates that the pseudogene arose from a reverse transcript of a correctly initiated and terminated functional human K#19 gene. This implies expression of K#19 keratin in addition to K#8 and K#18 in the early human embryo. We have proposed previously that K#19 evolved specifically to redress unbalanced production of various basic keratins, and our current evidence, that it is expressed at an early stage of development, implies that K#19 may fulfill this same role during human embryogenesis.\r"

  ".W": "Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a Mendelian disorder that includes familial polyposis coli (FPC) and Gardner syndrome (GS), has an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. It is characterized by hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps that can progress to carcinoma of the colon, suggesting that the gene that harbors the FAP germ-line mutation may play an important role in the somatic genetic pathway to colon cancer. The defect responsible for FAP was recently mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5 by linkage between the FPC phenotype and a locus defined by DNA probe pC11p11 (D5S71), located at 5q21-22. Because an important next step in the paradigm for identification of a disease gene is to obtain a more precise localization, we isolated and mapped by linkage six additional polymorphic DNA markers in the FAP region. Subsequent linkage analysis in six pedigrees, three having the FPC phenotype and three segregating GS, placed the FAP locus very close to a new marker, YN5.48 (D5S81), that is approximately 17 centimorgans distal to C11p11 on the genetic map. The analysis revealed no evidence of genetic heterogeneity between the two phenotypes, a question that had not been clearly resolved by the earlier studies. The new set of markers in the near vicinity of the FAP locus represents a further step toward isolation of the genetic defect and provides the opportunity for preclinical diagnosis of risk status for colon cancer among individuals in families that are segregating adenomatous polyposis.\r"

A total of 258 chromosome 7-specific single-copy DNA segments were identified, and most of them localized to subregions. Fifty three of these corresponded to DNA sequences in the 7q31-q32 region. Family and physical mapping studies showed that two of the DNA markers, D7S122 and D7S340, are in close linkage with CF. The data also showed that D7S122 and D7S340 map between MET and D7S8, the two genetic markers known to be on opposite sides of CF. The study thus reaffirms the general strategy in approaching a disease locus on the basis of chromosome location.\r"

With the large Centre d'Etude Polymorphisme Humain cohort, a refined map of DNA markers from this region was constructed, with the following locus order: D13S1-D13S21-D13S22-D13S10-ESD-RB-WND-D 13S26-D13S12-D13S2. A significant excess of male recombination was observed between D13S21 and D13S22. Intervals distal to D13S22 showed an excess of female recombination. When these markers were tested on 19 WD families from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, the two closest loci were shown to be RB and D13S26. The retinoblastoma gene locus (RB) was shown to be proximal to WND at a distance of 4.4 centimorgans (cM), and D13S26 was placed distal to WND at a distance of 4.0 cM.

In humans, recent population growth and movements of specific ethnic groups across wide geographic areas mean that any theory based on assumptions of constant population size and absence of substructure is generally untenable. We examine the effects of population subdivision on the pattern of protein genetic variation in a total sample drawn from an artificial agglomerate of 12 tribal populations of Central and South America, analyzing the pooled sample as though it were a single population. Several striking findings emerge. (1) Mean heterozygosity is not sensitive to agglomeration, but the number of different alleles (allele count) is inflated, relative to neutral mutation/drift/equilibrium expectation. (2) The inflation is most serious for rare alleles, especially those which originally occurred as tribally restricted \"private\" polymorphisms. (3) The degree of inflation is an increasing function of both the number of populations encompassed by the sample and of the genetic divergence among them. (4) Treating an agglomerated population as though it were a panmictic unit of long standing can lead to serious biases in estimates of mutation rates, selection pressures, and effective population sizes. Current DNA studies indicate the presence of numerous genetic variants in human populations. The findings and conclusions of this paper are all fully applicable to the study of genetic variation at the DNA level as well.\r"

In a separate study, we have examined the frequency of micronuclei in cytochalasin B-arrested, binucleate cells and shown that a similar frequency of cells (1.6%) contain one or more micronuclei. Using in situ hybridization of an alpha centromeric probe (alpha R1), which hybridizes to 9 of the 22 human autosomes, we were able to infer that most, if not all, of the micronuclei contain whole chromosomes or chromatids. Since the loss of a chromosome by lagging will induce hypoploid daughter nuclei (two where a chromosome is lost and one where a chromatid is lost), we conclude that lagging is a major mechanism for chromosome loss in human lymphocyte cultures. This loss occurs in the cells of normal individuals under control conditions.\r"

Liver ADH activity of about 90% of Orientals is much higher than that of most Caucasians, while approximately 50% of Orientals lack the ALDH2 activity. The genetic differences have been implicated in the high incidence of alcohol sensitivity observed in Orientals. We determined, by means of hybridization of genomic DNA samples with allele-specific synthetic oligonucleotide probes, genotypes of the ADH2 and the ALDH2 loci of Japanese with alcoholic liver diseases and of control subjects. No significant difference between the patient and control groups was found in the ADH2 genotypes. A remarkable genetic difference between the two groups was found in the ALDH2 locus. The frequency of the typical (Caucasian-type) ALDH1(2) gene was found to be .65 and that of the atypical (Oriental type) ALDH2(2) gene was .35 in the controls, while these were .93 and .07, respectively, in the patients. Thus, most (20 of 23) of the Japanese patients were homozygous Caucasian type ALDH1(2)/ALDH1(2), only three were heterozygous ALDH1(2)/ALDH2(2), and none of the patients were homozygous Oriental type ALDH2(2)/ALDH2(2). The results indicate that Japanese with the atypical ALDH2(2) allele are at a much lower risk in developing the alcoholic liver diseases than are those with homozygous, usual (Caucasian-type) ALDH1(2)/ALDH1(2), presumably owing to their sensitivity to alcohol intoxication.\r"

A single gene, FUCA 1, located on chromosome 1p34.1-1p36.1 encodes for alpha-L-fucosidase activity. To gain insight into the nature of the molecular defects leading to fucosidosis, we have characterized the genomic structure of FUCA 1. Restriction-endonuclease analysis suggests that at least seven exons dispersed over 22 kb are present in genomic FUCA 1. Two restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been identified in the Caucasian population. The PvuII and BglI RFLPs each have two codominant alleles in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Allele frequencies for the PvuII RFLP are .70/.30, and those for the BglI RFLP .63/.37. Both RFLPs are in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other, with a correlation coefficient of .94. The polymorphism information content (PIC) of the combined DNA markers is .38, high enough to be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of fucosidosis. The combined lod score for linkage between the fucosidosis mutation and FUCA 1 markers in two families was significant at a recombination fraction of 0. This suggests that the fucosidosis mutation resides in FUCA 1.\r"

The disease results from deficient activity of alpha-L-fucosidase (E.C.3.2.1.51), a lysosomal enzyme that hydrolyzes fucose from fucoglycoconjugates. In an attempt to identify the mutation(s) that result(s) in fucosidosis, we performed Southern blot analysis of the structural gene encoding alpha-L-fucosidase (FUCA 1) in 23 patients affected with fucosidosis. In five patients Southern blot analysis showed obliteration of an EcoRI restriction site in the open reading frame of FUCA 1 encoding mature alpha-L-fucosidase. This abnormality was not observed in 80 controls, and it may be the basic defect responsible for fucosidosis in these patients. Both patients with the severe type I form of fucosidosis and patients with the less severe type II were shown to be homozygous for this presumed mutation. In the remaining 18 patients the EcoRI site obliteration, major-gene deletions, or insertions were not detected. This suggests that at least two different mutations are involved in fucosidosis. The heterogeneity found at the DNA level was not present at the protein level, as all fucosidosis patients investigated had low fucosidase protein (less than 6% of normal) and negligible fucosidase activity in fibroblasts and lymphoblastoid cell lines.\r"

In vitro translation of transcripts from this vector produced a pre-E2b fragment of Mr 39,000. Following import into mitochondria, this protein was processed to a protein with an Mr of 36,000. The processed protein was fully protected from trypsin digestion. Import and processing did not occur in the presence of rhodamine 123 or carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone, suggesting that membrane potential and coupled respiration were required. Uptake and processing were species and tissue independent, since both mouse-liver and human-lymphoblast mitochondria converted the human pre-E2b protein fragment. Mitochondria from patient cells that lack E2b through an inherited defect were able to import and process the in vitro-made protein, suggesting that the inherited defect was in the gene for E2b and not in the organelle-structure function. This system now provides additional methods for investigation of mechanisms responsible for the human inherited disorders affecting the branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex.\r"

The frequency of antigen B40 in the presence of antigen Cw3 was found to be significantly lower in subjects with cardiomyopathy.

The mean +/- SD levels of plasma ACE were 34.1 +/- 10.7, 30.7 +/- 10.4 and 43.1 +/- 17.2 units/liter in fathers (n = 87), mothers (n = 87) and offspring (n = 169), respectively. Plasma ACE was uncorrelated with age, height, weight, or blood pressure in the parents, but a negative correlation with age was observed in offspring (r = -.32). The age-adjusted familial correlations of plasma ACE were .038, .166, .323 and .303 for spouses, father-offspring, mother-offspring, and siblings, respectively. The results of the genetic analysis suggest that a major gene may affect the interindividual variability of plasma ACE, with different codominant effects in parents and offspring. According to this model, the major gene effect accounts for 4.8, 4.0, and 10.8 units/liter of the overall mean and for 29%, 29% and 75% of the variance of age-adjusted ACE in fathers, mothers, and offspring, respectively. The estimate of the probability of the less frequent allele is .26, and the major gene effect is approximately twice as great in high homozygotes than in heterozygotes and in offspring than in parents. The results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of a familial resemblance of plasma ACE activity in healthy families and suggest that this observation can be explained by the segregation of a major gene.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Clinicians have difficulty interpreting results of tests for anti-cardiolipin antibodies (aCL) because of conflicting reports of the clinical associations of these antibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We therefore decided to evaluate the clinical associations of aCL in an effort to facilitate interpretation of single reports of either positive or negative test results. We also assessed the role of estrogen on the development of aCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 85 consecutive outpatients with SLE and 40 control subjects. Serum samples and clinical and laboratory data were obtained from each patient and control. Testing for aCL was performed using a standardized enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay developed at an international workshop. RESULTS: The presence of aCL was documented in 42.4 percent of patients with SLE and 7.5 percent of control subjects. In patients with SLE, these antibodies were significantly associated with thrombosis, fetal loss, and thrombocytopenia, but not with other manifestations. Measurement of all isotypes optimized clinical correlations. Titers did not add clinical utility. Fluctuations of levels of aCL occurred, making it difficult to interpret a single negative result. Among control subjects, the presence of aCL was not significantly more common in women who used oral contraceptives. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that positive results of testing for aCL correlate with a predisposition for thrombosis, fetal loss, and thrombocytopenia in patients with SLE; however, the test is not predictive for other clinical manifestations of SLE, including activity and severity of disease. We believe that measurement of all isotypes of aCL should be performed in patients with SLE considering pregnancy, to identify those with a high risk of fetal loss, and in SLE patients with a thrombotic episode.\r"

The purpose of this study was to identify prognostic factors in a large group of patients with chronic hepatitis. We also wanted to determine whether the aminopyrine breath test (ABT) is of additional prognostic value in evaluation of this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 94 patients who had had a biopsy-proven diagnosis and an ABT between June 1, 1977, and June 30, 1981. Clinical features and biochemical test results at the time of diagnosis were retrieved from medical records, and histologic severity was assessed by reviewing all liver biopsy specimens under code. Survival was determined at a mean of 60 months. Data were studied with a Cox proportional hazards model to identify predictors of mortality and to control for confounding variables. RESULTS: Cumulative mortality as of December 31, 1985, was 5 percent in chronic persistent hepatitis, 6 percent in chronic active hepatitis, 29 percent in chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis, and 53 percent in chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis. Histologic severity was a predictor of death (p less than 0.005). Other predictors of mortality were disease caused by hepatitis B virus (p less than 0.005), a high alkaline phosphatase level (p less than 0.025), a low alanine aminotransaminase level (p less than 0.001), and a depressed ABT result (p less than 0.005). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that patients with chronic hepatitis with one or more of these risk factors have an increased mortality and should be followed closely for liver failure, which may necessitate medical therapy or surgical intervention.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Our goal was to examine the clinical significance of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. In addition, preliminary data concerning the possible mechanism of cholestasis observed during S. aureus septicemia are presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study had two parts: a clinical investigation and a laboratory investigation. In the former, patients with endocarditis were identified through chart review. Those with admission total serum bilirubin levels of 2.0 mg/dl or greater were considered to have hyperbilirubinemia. In the latter investigation, the hepatic storage capacity and transport maximum for sulfobromophthalein (BSP), an organic dye that is rapidly taken up and excreted by the liver, were determined by measuring the change in serum concentration and the corresponding hepatic removal rate at various BSP infusion rates. Measurements were conducted before and after the infusion of Escherichia coli-derived lipopolysaccharide in some rabbits, after the infusion of resuspended S. aureus in others, and after the infusion of lipoteichoic acid in the remainder. RESULTS: Eleven of 47 consecutive patients with S. aureus endocarditis were noted to have hyperbilirubinemia without clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic bacterial infection. Compared with the remaining 36 patients, these 11 patients had a significantly lower mean platelet count and a higher serum creatinine level and white blood cell count. Although none of the 47 patients were hypotensive on admission, four of the 11 hyperbilirubinemic patients died of overwhelming sepsis, compared with two of the 36 remaining patients (p less than 0.05). When one of the clinical isolates of S. aureus or lipoteichoic acid was infused into conscious rabbits, there was a marked decrease in the hepatic transport maximum and an increase in the relative hepatic storage capacity of sulfobromophthalein. Similar changes were noted following the administration of lipopolysaccharide. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the presence of hyperbilirubinemia in patients with S. aureus sepsis may identify persons at high risk of dying from overwhelming sepsis. It further suggests that lipoteichoic acid may play an important role in causing defective hepatic excretory function that is responsible for hyperbilirubinemia.\r"

In an effort to achieve a better outcome in patients with these infections, aggressive management was combined with medical/surgical intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A series of 18 immunocompromised patients with invasive sinonasal fungal infections was retrospectively analyzed. Management consisted of a combined modality clinical approach, including aggressively sought early diagnosis; early amphotericin use; extensive surgical debridement; and liberal use of granulocyte transfusion support. RESULTS: Eight of 13 patients with eventual neutrophil recovery survived with control of all local and systemic signs of fungal infection. All patients with persisting neutropenia died of progressive infection. CONCLUSION: We conclude that meticulous surveillance of patients in high-risk groups for fungal infection should be maintained due to the apparent value of rapid intervention with a combination of surgical resection and medical management (antifungal chemotherapy and white blood cell transfusions). Infection control and survival are ultimately dependent on recovery of marrow function and circulating neutrophils.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus (A. anitratus) can cause nosocomially and community acquired pneumonia. Source identification of the organism is often difficult. An outbreak of respiratory infection and colonization with A. anitratus affecting 93 ventilated patients in all six of a hospital's intensive care units (ICUs) over 10 months is described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In April 1984, the infection control staff started to review positive culture results from all patients in all ICUs. At this point, information on significant isolates was recorded by patient, site, date, genus and species, and antimicrobial susceptibility. During the month of August 1984, an increased number of A. anitratus isolates from sputum began to be detected. Information was expanded to include the date of hospital admission, ICU admission, intubation, and extubation; the dates and types of all surgical procedures; the results and dates of all prior sputum cultures; and the use of nebulized bronchodilator medications. Monthly numbers of cases were compared for four months prior to the outbreak, during the outbreak, and for seven months after the outbreak. Plasmid DNA from isolates was prepared, electrophoresed, and visualized. Isolates were designated according to the molecular weights of visualized plasmids. RESULTS: Barrier precautions and improved staff handwashing did not diminish the frequency of new cases. When pasteurized, reusable ventilator circuits and resuscitation bags were cultured for the possibility of low-level contamination, 18 percent were positive for A. anitratus. Terminal ethylene oxide sterilization of these devices was associated with prompt control of the outbreak. Plasmid DNA analysis of isolates from patients involved in the outbreak, contaminated devices, and the hands of personnel responsible for device disinfection revealed two predominant plasmid profiles. After outbreak control, isolates with these profiles were found much less frequently in patient specimens. CONCLUSION: Contaminated, reusable ventilator support equipment may be a leading cause for the extent of A. anitratus in the sputum of intubated patients. This problem is potentially correctable by the use of terminal etyhlene oxide sterilization of reusable ventilator circuits and resuscitation bags.\r"

Our intention was to systematically investigate the incidence of the bcr rearrangement in such patients, and to correlate the findings with patient characteristics, response to therapy (especially alpha interferon treatment), and overall prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Molecular analysis studies were performed in 40 patients with Ph-negative CML (23 patients) and myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; 17 patients). RESULTS: Rearrangement of the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) was detected in 11 of the 23 patients with Ph-negative CML (48 percent), indicating the presence of the abnormal molecular events in Ph-positive CML without documentation of the Ph cytogenetic abnormality. None of the 17 patients with CMML had the bcr rearrangement. Patients with Ph-negative CML and the bcr rearrangement had characteristics similar to those of patients with Ph-positive disease. These included a younger age, higher white blood cell counts, a higher incidence of thrombocytosis and basophilia, and a lower occurrence of thrombocytopenia. The leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score was not a helpful distinguishing feature. Among 21 patients receiving alpha interferon-based regimens, response to therapy was significantly better among patients with Ph-negative disease and the bcr rearrangement (seven of seven, 100 percent), compared with those without the bcr rearrangement (one of six, 17 percent), or patients with CMML (two of eight, 25 percent) (p less than 0.01). At this time of follow-up, only one of the 11 patients with Ph-negative CML and the bcr rearrangement had died from complications of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, compared with three deaths among the 12 patients with Ph-negative CML and no bcr rearrangement, and 11 deaths among the 19 patients with CMML. CONCLUSION: We conclude that molecular studies help in better understanding the nosology of Ph-negative CML, and define a subgroup of patients with clinical, therapeutic, and prognostic correlations similar to those of patients with Ph-positive CML.\r"

With the declining prevalence of rheumatic heart disease, however, the spectrum of valvular heart disease is changing. We retrospectively analyzed our experience with SLE between 1975 and 1987 for the presence of hemodynamically significant valvular heart disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An existing data base of 421 patients with SLE was selected for review. Patients were selected for inclusion in the study if they met four or more of the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association for SLE, they had clinically significant valvular heart disease, and tissue from the involved valve was available for review. The etiology of the valve lesion was determined by assessment of the clinical history, chart review, gross morphology, and valve histology. RESULTS: Of 14 cases with pathologic material available for review, six had anatomic features of SLE valvular heart disease such as verrucous vegetations or valvulitis with necrosis and vasculitis. Two of these patients underwent successful valve replacements and four died from complications of their valve disease. CONCLUSION: We suggest that significant morbidity and mortality may result from SLE valvular heart disease in about 1 to 2 percent of SLE patients and that the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying valve dysfunction in SLE patients are multifactorial.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: In Japan, early gastric cancer has an excellent survival rate. In the United States, the disease is less well understood, and it is viewed more pessimistically, although we have previously shown in a small series of patients good short-term survival rates in early gastric cancer as compared with advanced gastric cancer. Our purpose in this study was to determine if the incidence of early gastric cancer and the associated survival rate has changed over a 24-year period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From the records at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, 549 patients were identified who underwent gastric resection for cancer between 1960 and 1984, 69 of whom had early gastric cancer. Survival data were obtained in 63 patients. A comparison of survival rates was conducted between patients with early gastric cancer and the 1980 census figures. RESULTS: Over the 24-year period, the total number of resections for gastric cancer at our institution declined. However, the percentage of gastric resections that satisfied the Japanese criteria for early gastric cancer increased from 9 percent between 1960 to 1974 to 17 percent between 1975 to 1984 (p less than 0.05). Of the 69 early gastric cancers, 35 percent involved the mucosa, whereas in 65 percent the malignancy invaded the submucosa. Twenty-eight percent had lymph node involvement. For the patients for whom survival data were available, survival was better than the 1980 census (p less than 0.05). The adjusted five-year survival rate was 97 percent. Neither submucosal invasion nor lymph node involvement altered survival. Patients with type III early cancers (ulcerated), however, had a significantly greater survival rate than patients with type I (polypoid) early cancers (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION: Early gastric cancer is being diagnosed with increasing frequency and has an excellent survival rate. These findings are similar to the Japanese experience and argue for an ongoing aggressive approach to endoscopic biopsy of gastric lesions.\r"

It is characterized by abrupt alteration in mental status and respiratory alkalosis associated with markedly elevated plasma ammonium levels in the absence of any identifiable cause, and frequently results in intractable coma and death. Our goal was to survey clinical and pathologic manifestations of the disorder and discuss treatment options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma ammonium levels were measured in patients on the acute leukemia service or on the bone marrow transplant service at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and a level more than twice normal was considered diagnostic of hyperammonemia. The syndrome was identified in nine patients; in eight, hyperammonemia occurred after administration of intensive cytoreductive therapy that resulted in profound leukopenia. The disorder occurred in the ninth patient two months after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: Three of the nine patients survived an episode of idiopathic hyperammonemia; one patient subsequently died of leukemia and one of recurrent idiopathic hyperammonemia. The one long-term survivor is currently alive and well without neurologic sequelae 250 days after autologous bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSION: Because neurologic function can deteriorate rapidly, early recognition of this disorder and close monitoring of the patient's neurologic status are critical.\r"

Thirty-seven obstetric patients, 32 with an obstetric risk factor, donated an average of 485 ml of blood. Twenty-one of the 37 patients were expected to undergo cesarean section. Nonstress testing was performed before and after phlebotomy. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring was maintained throughout the donation, which lasted an average of 9 minutes. All nonstress test results were normal before and after the phlebotomy except in one case. All fetal heart rates remained stable during phlebotomy and premature labor was not precipitated. All fetal outcomes were normal. One patient delivered on the day of phlebotomy, 6 hours after the procedure. Only one of the autologous units was used, in a patient who had a pelvic infection and moderate anemia. The incidence of primary cesarean section was 35%. Phlebotomy of the mother appears to be safe for the fetus at term. Further investigation is needed to determine the safety of removal of more than 1 unit of blood and blood donation at earlier gestational ages.\r"

The answers formed the basis for a consensus conference and a symposium, which resulted in the following recommendations. The pregnancy should be interrupted when preterm premature rupture of membranes occurs before week 20 of gestation; individualized management is needed for preterm premature rupture of membranes between 20 and 25 weeks. After 25 weeks, institute hospitalization and bed rest, with a body temperature check twice a day, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring daily, and ultrasonography every second week. Cervical and urethral flora should be cultured once a week. Antibiotic infusion and prompt delivery should be instituted if an intrauterine infection occurs, and tocolysis is called for in cases of preterm labor in which intrauterine infection and abruptio placentae can be excluded. Labor should be induced between 32 and 34 weeks' gestation if spontaneous contractions do not occur. Cesarean section should be considered in cases of breech presentation earlier than 34 weeks, with delivery in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit if before 32 weeks' gestation.\r"

  ".W": "Decreased incidence of proteinuric hypertension after low-dose aspirin therapy is hypothesized to be a consequence of selective thromboxane A2 inhibition and sparing of prostacyclin. This study was designed to ascertain if low-dose aspirin therapy (81 mg/day for 1 week) alters vascular refractoriness to angiotensin II and the prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 ratio in pregnant women sensitive to angiotensin II (n = 17). Low-dose aspirin increased the effective pressor dose of angiotensin II from 5.9 +/- 2.4 to 10.2 +/- 5.5 ng/kg/min (p less than 0.01, mean +/- SD). Platelet-derived serum thromboxane B2 (a metabolite of thromboxane A2), a measure of therapy compliance, decreased from 1804 +/- 1771 to 132 +/- 206 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Plasma thromboxane B2 decreased from 130 +/- 107 to 19 +/- 12 pg/ml (p less than 0.01). Inhibition was not selective because 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (a metabolite of prostacyclin) also decreased from 243 +/- 90 to 163 +/- 90 pg/ml (p = 0.039) and prostaglandin E2 was reduced from 155 +/- 67 to 95 +/- 40 pg/ml (p = 0.014). Decreases in thromboxane B2, however, were significantly greater (75% +/- 19%) than decreases in 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (21% +/- 33%) or prostaglandin E2 (29% +/- 36%); thus the 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha/thromboxane B2 ratio increased from 3.1 +/- 2.0 to 12.4 +/- 9.9 (p less than 0.01). Although low-dose aspirin increases the effective pressor dose of angiotensin II, it does not return to normal pregnancy values. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that this represents only a partial selective prostaglandin inhibition.\r"

All 41 specimens stained with oil red O on frozen sections showed a significant amount of microvesicular fat droplets in varying degrees. In contrast, only 11 of the 41 stained conventionally (with hematoxylin-eosin) showed significant fatty infiltration. The density of hepatocellular fat correlated positively with plasma urate concentration and negatively with the platelet count. These findings suggest that preeclampsia may be one of several microvesicular fatty diseases of the liver and that acute fatty liver of pregnancy may be the most severe form.\r"

The reticulocyte count increased linearly with fetal anemia, and the erythroblast count increased exponentially. Significant erythroblastosis was observed only when the hemoglobin concentration deficit was greater than 7 gm/dl. Of the 52 fetuses with a hemoglobin concentration deficit greater than 7 gm/dl, 35 had ultrasonographic evidence of hydrops. These data suggest that medullary hematopoiesis is stimulated by mild anemia and that recruitment of extramedullary sites occurs when anemia is severe. Extensive hepatic erythropoiesis may be the cause of fetal hydrops in red blood cell isoimmunization.\r"

Transabdominal cord sampling by ultrasonic guidance was performed on 10 of these patients. Umbilical arterial and venous blood was obtained in all patients from the doubly clamped cord at the time of cesarean section. The blood samples were analyzed for respiratory gases, acid-base balance, and lactate concentrations. A significant relationship was found between the pulsatility index and pH, PCO2, and lactate concentrations measured on umbilical venous blood sampled in utero. The pulsatility index also correlated with the same variables measured on venous and arterial blood sampled at cesarean section. Umbilical venous blood obtained transabdominally had a significantly higher oxygen content than blood obtained at cesarean section. No significant correlation was found between umbilical venous oxygen content obtained at transabdominal cord sampling and the pulsatility index. At a pulsatility index greater than 1.5, lactate concentrations in umbilical venous blood increased sharply. There would appear to be a curvilinear relationship between umbilical blood flow and these indices of fetal oxygenation, such that moderate increases in pulsatility index were not associated with a significant increase in fetal lactate concentrations.\r"

  ".W": "Ninety-four patients with borderline ovarian tumors were retrospectively analyzed for clinical features, treatments, and survival characteristics. There were 46 patients with FIGO stage IA cancer, 7 with stage IB, 20 with stage IC, 4 with stage IIB, 5 with stage IIC, 5 with stage IIIA, 3 with stage IIIB, and 4 with stage IIIC tumors. Seventy patients had at least a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 20 patients had conservative surgery including unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy, and 4 patients had bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Fifteen patients with stage I disease received adjuvant melphalan therapy and 2 received external beam radiation for concomitant gynecologic cancers; 7 with stage II tumors received adjuvant melphalan therapy and 1 received external beam radiation; and 5 with stage III tumors received melphalan therapy and 6 patients received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. Follow-up ranged from 1 to 117 months, with a median of 33.5 months. Eighty-seven patients were alive. Seven patients died, two of disease. The overall 5-year survival rate was 83.0%; those treated with adjuvant therapy had a 79.5% survival, whereas the others had 84.6% survival. Second-look surgery was performed in 10 patients; six results were negative after melphalan therapy, one was negative after cisplatin combination therapy, and one was negative after no adjuvant treatment. Two patients had positive second-look surgery, one with stage IIIC disease treated with a cisplatin combination and the other with stage IC disease treated with melphalan. This review did not demonstrate that patients with borderline ovarian tumors benefited from adjuvant therapy.\r"

  ".W": "To determine the long-term rate of recurrence and define risk factors for recurrence, we have analyzed clinical information on 83 patients followed up for a minimum of 4 years (median, 69 months) after negative second-look laparotomy. Overall, 21 of 83 patients (25.3%) had a recurrence. Median interval to recurrence was 14 months. Stage, grade, and type of chemotherapy were significantly related to risk of recurrence. In patients with stage I disease only one of 27 (3.7%) had a recurrence. Patients with stage I disease were not included in further analysis of risk factors. In stages II, III, and IV, 20 of 56 patients (35.7%) had a recurrence. Recurrence rates by grade (excluding stage I) are as follows: grade 1, three of 21 (14.3%); grade 2, six of 17 (35.5%), and grade 3, 11 of 17 (64.7%). Platinum-treated patients in stages II, III, and IV had a 50% (12/24) recurrence rate compared with 25% in nonplatinum-treated patients (8/32) (p = 0.05). Differences in disease-free survival between platinum- and nonplatinum-treated patients were significant at the p = 0.02 level. When treated with platinum-based regimens, more patients will achieve complete clinical remission and subsequently negative second-look laparotomy. However, the recurrence rate in these patients is considerably higher than that in patients treated for longer durations with nonplatinum regimens.\r"

  ".U": "89047603\r", 
  ".W": "Resistance of a cancer cell to therapy represents an important problem in tumor biology. Hypotheses concerning the mechanism of resistance have included genetic instability, gene amplification, aneuploidy, and altered cell growth kinetics. Cytogenetic assays allow for the analysis of each of these parameters and provide important information concerning tumor heterogeneity. In using cytogenetic analysis, we have analyzed a human ovarian carcinoma clinically resistant to therapy. The ovarian carcinoma had a complex but stable karyotype with a mean chromosome number of 61.7 chromosomes/cell. Approximately 50% of the metaphase preparations examined had double-minute chromosomes, which have sometimes been associated with gene amplification. The frequency of double minutes varied from one pair to hundreds of pairs per cell. Cell cycle kinetic analysis revealed an average generation time of 38 hours. The cells were relatively resistant to doxorubicin in vitro, and the baseline sister chromatid exchange frequency, a measure of genetic instability, was elevated. These results suggest that cytogenetic assays have potential as predictive assays of tumor chemoresistance and may provide information regarding the biologic aggressiveness encountered clinically.\r"

The groups had comparable numbers of black and white subjects. Pregnancy weight gain affected birth weight in the average-weight group but did not significantly affect birth weight in the highly overweight group. Infant outcomes for both groups were similar. These findings suggest that consideration should be given to not requiring a minimum weight gain for women whose degree of overweight equals or exceeds 135% of standard body weight for height.\r"
