  ".W": "The present study was undertaken to clarify the altered effect of arachidonic acid on inner ear blood flow in rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes by use of the laser-Doppler flowmeter. Drugs were administered intraarterially via the subclavian artery in a dose range that did not affect the systemic blood pressure. Both arachidonic acid and papaverine hydrochloride increased inner ear blood flow dose-dependently. Diabetic rats at 12 weeks, but not at 8 weeks, after the induction of diabetes showed a significant decrease in arachidonic acid response. However, there were no differences in papaverine response between diabetic and control rats. Pretreatment with ONO-3708, a selective thromboxane A2 antagonist, reversed the attenuated response to arachidonic acid found in diabetic rats. An increased response to thromboxane A2, which decreased inner ear blood flow, was also found in 12-week diabetic rats. In electrocochleograms, the latency in 12-week diabetic rats was significantly delayed compared with that in control rats, and this prolonged latency improved with insulin treatment. These results suggest that the responsiveness of inner ear blood flow to prostaglandins may be altered in individuals with diabetes mellitus.\r"

Both types of inhibition by MRD disappeared when UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide was preincubated with ether-treated cells. Moreover, MRD completely inhibited lipid-intermediate I (undecaprenyl-p-p-MurNAc-pentapeptide) formation at a concentration below the MIC. From these results, it was concluded that the real target of MRD's action was translocase, which catalyzes lipid-intermediate I formation from UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide and a lipid carrier.\r"

All four strains were resistant to erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracycline and to high levels of gentamicin and streptomycin. One strain was also resistant to chloramphenicol. Plasmid profiles revealed four different plasmid patterns, with the number of identified plasmids ranging from zero to three. The gene coding for beta-lactamase production could be transferred at low frequency (less than 10(-8)) to an enterococcal recipient from one strain in conjunction with all of the other resistance determinants. Probes derived from the staphylococcal beta-lactamase gene and gentamicin resistance gene failed to hybridize with any of the detectable plasmids, but both genes were present on restriction fragments of genomic DNA in all strains. Our results indicate that the beta-lactamase genes and gentamicin resistance genes in these strains are integrated into the bacterial chromosome. The cotransmissibility of the resistance determinants raises the possibility of their incorporation into a multiresistance transposable genetic element.\r"

AZT was more potent than ddI as an inhibitor of HIV in vitro. Synergistic inhibition of HIV by the combination of these agents was observed in MT4 cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes, and macrophages. Toxicity assessment in vitro by using progenitor (erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage) colony-forming assays with normal human bone marrow showed ddI to be less toxic than AZT. Addition of inhibitory concentrations of ddI to AZT resulted in additive inhibition of progenitor CFUs. These in vitro findings suggest that combinations of ddI and AZT at appropriately modified doses may provide an enhanced degree of selectivity in anti-HIV chemotherapy.\r"

The possible causes of this alarmingly high rate were examined, with catheter care techniques on the wards coming under particular scrutiny. As a result protocols were modified and an intensive staff training programme implemented throughout the hospital, led by the nutritional care sister. Subsequently, the catheter sepsis rate was significantly reduced with only 9/107 (8%) of consecutive catheters becoming infected. These findings emphasise the key role that education of staff plays in controlling central venous catheter sepsis and the importance and cost effectiveness of special nursing staff in implementing such measures.\r"

Total blood volume, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, urine flow rate, and urinary sodium excretion did not change.

  ".U": "91221774\r", 
  ".W": "The merits of oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solutions have been well established in experimental animals. The positive effects of oxygenation of Plasmalyte B (Sabax Ltd) and St. Thomas Hospital solution (Plegisol) were achieved by gassing with 95% O2/5% CO2 and 100% O2, respectively. In view of the marked pH differences induced by these gas mixtures, we evaluated the effect of mode of oxygenation on myocardial recovery during reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegic arrest. Oxygenation with 100% O2 of Plasmalyte B containing high K+ levels caused marked deterioration in myocardial recovery, whereas the mode of oxygenation did not affect recovery after arrest with St. Thomas Hospital solution. Because the major differences between these solutions reside in their respective K+, Mg2+, and HCO3- contents, the effects of variations in the levels of these ions were investigated. The results showed that oxygenation with 100% O2 was deleterious only in the presence of high K+ (29 mmol/L), low Mg2+ (3 mmol/L), and high NaHCO3 (28 mmol/L) levels. The marked decline in mechanical recovery during reperfusion was associated with significant changes in myocardial adenosine triphosphate and intracellular Ca2+ levels. Although an explanation for these findings is not readily available, it is suggested that complex ionic interactions and possibly oxygen free radical generation may lead to intracellular Ca2+ overload, depression in mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate generation, and, hence, deterioration in mechanical recovery.\r"

  ".U": "91221775\r", 
  ".W": "To determine whether coronary reperfusion enhances the production of endothelium-derived contracting factor, we investigated dogs subjected to global cardiac ischemia (45 minutes) followed by reperfusion (60 minutes). Segments of reperfused and control coronary arteries were suspended in organ chambers to measure isometric force. Perfusate hypoxia caused endothelium-dependent contraction in the control and reperfused arteries. However, reperfused arteries exhibited hypoxic contraction that was significantly greater than control segments. The hypoxic contractions in both the control and reperfused arteries could be inhibited by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), the blocker of endothelial cell synthesis of nitric oxide from L-arginine. The action of L-NMMA could be reversed by L-arginine but not D-arginine. Thus, after reperfusion, augmented production of endothelium-derived contracting factor occurs by an L-arginine-dependent pathway. We hypothesize that nitric oxide produced by L-arginine metabolism combines with superoxide anion to produce the peroxynitrite anion (ONOO-), which is metabolized to endothelium-derived contracting factor or induces its synthesis. Augmented production of endothelium-derived contracting factor would favor vasospasm after reperfusion.\r"

Group 1 underwent gas compression of the vitreous followed by tissue plasminogen activator injection in doses of 25, 50, and 100 micrograms (all doses were administered in 100 microL of fluid). Group 2 underwent lensectomy and vitrectomy followed by tissue plasminogen activator injection of 100 micrograms. Group 3 underwent lensectomy, vitrectomy, and complete fluid/gas exchange prior to injections of 12.5 and 25 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator. Control eyes received 100 microL of balanced salt solution. In group 1, no retinal toxic reactions were observed after administration of 25 or 50 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator, but all eyes receiving 100 micrograms demonstrated retinal damage on ophthalmoscopy, electroretinography, and light microscopy. In group 2, no retinal toxic reactions were seen after administration of 100 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator. In group 3, two of 11 eyes receiving 25 micrograms of tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated toxic retinal changes by ophthalmoscopy, electroretinography, and light microscopy. These results suggest that gas compression of the vitreous does not significantly alter the toxic changes seen caused by tissue plasminogen activator. While lensectomy and vitrectomy appears to widen the therapeutic window for tissue plasminogen activator, the margin of safety is reduced with the addition of a large gas bubble.\r"

RS patients showed significantly increased C trachomatis-specific synovial fluid (SF) T cell proliferation. Proliferating cells were found in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. The SF lymphocyte proliferative response to C trachomatis in RS was inhibited by anti-class I and class II major histocompatibility complex monoclonal antibodies, while the response to tuberculin purified protein derivative was inhibited only by anti-class II monoclonal antibodies. T cell receptor gamma/delta-bearing T cells were not consistently increased in RS SF compared with peripheral blood, nor did such cells consistently expand upon in vitro culture with C trachomatis. Finally, there was no correlation between the cellular immune response and levels of antibody to C trachomatis antigens. Our results indicate that a specific T cell response to C trachomatis within the joint plays a role in the pathogenesis of RS.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To test whether early diagnosis and practical help reduce the number of elderly people with dementia admitted to institutions. DESIGN--Controlled trial of effect of help from a multidisciplinary team on admission rates of people with dementia. SETTING--Seven general practices in Cambridge. SUBJECTS--2889 subjects aged 75 and over, of whom 159 were identified as having dementia with a two stage community survey. Eighty six subjects were referred for extra help if they or their supporters wished. The other 73 subjects had access to the usual services and served as controls. INTERVENTION--Subjects and families in the action group were offered a wide range of help, including financial benefits, physical aids, home helps, respite admissions, practical advice, and psychiatric assessments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Permanent admission to long term care within two years after diagnosis. RESULTS--Early intervention did not affect admission rates in subjects who lived with supporters. By contrast, nine of the 14 (64%) subjects with moderate or severe dementia living alone were admitted in the action group in the study's second year compared with only one of 13 (8%) controls (p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS--Some people with moderate or severe dementia who lived alone and were at serious risk may have been identified earlier by the resource team. Without the team these people would not have become known to the responsible authorities until families, neighbours, and wardens became unable to cope. The study was conducted during the team's formative period, however, and greater experience might have allowed some subjects to remain at home for longer.\r"

DESIGN--The study consisted of three parts: a review of the current treatment and published reports on treatment, the formation of a protocol, and a study of treatment after introducing the protocol. SETTING--Accident and emergency department of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--550 patients attending the department with ankle injuries over four months. RESULTS--The review of treatment showed that patients with fractures were detected and treated adequately, but most had radiography. Patients with ligamentous injuries may have been undertreated. After introducing the protocol the number of patients undergoing radiography was reduced from 205 (80%) to 186 (70%) (0.0027 less than p less than 0.01). In 87% of the notes reviewed the protocol had been completed. Sixty six patients with ligamentous injuries were reviewed in the department or soft tissue clinic compared with 20 before the protocol was introduced. There was a 53% reduction in inappropriate referrals to the fracture clinic (13 before v nine after). CONCLUSIONS--Using a protocol can, at little expense, improve the treatment of ankle injuries and reduce the cost of radiology in an accident and emergency department. IMPLICATION--Treatment of other conditions may be improved by introducing a protocol.\r"

The benefit of routine screening of pregnant women for the presence of these antibodies has not been established, and the yield from such screening studies has been found to be low. No treatment regimen has eliminated fetal loss and adverse pregnancy events completely in women with the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Even when treatment is instituted, maternal and fetal status must be monitored closely. Management of such patients has not been standardized, and various treatment regimens have been found to be efficacious. Multicenter randomized treatment trials are currently underway, and standardization of therapy in these patients may be achieved.\r"

In this study the relationship between the synthesis of atrial natriuretic factor at the level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and the atrial storage and circulating plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor were investigated in 15 patients with heart failure. The patients underwent right and left heart catheterization before cardiac surgery for valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting. 2. Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were correlated to atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA. Atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor exhibited a close correlation to both pulmonary artery pressure and left atrial pressure. No relationship, however, could be found between the right atrial content of atrial natriuretic factor and both the expression of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA in the atria and the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor. 3. From these data it may be concluded that increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor in the pressure- and/or volume-overloaded heart are associated with an elevated level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA. We suggest that not only plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor but also the expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the atrial are related to left ventricular filling pressures in the failing human heart.\r"

  ".W": "1. Aldosterone is suppressed by sodium loading. We studied the contribution of this decrease in plasma aldosterone to the natriuresis after acute sodium loading in healthy volunteers. 2. Two litres of saline [0.9% (w/v) NaCl] were infused during the second hour of a 6 h infusion of aldosterone (3 pmol min-1 kg-1) or placebo in eight healthy young men. On the placebo day, plasma aldosterone decreased by 30 min after the start of saline infusion and remained suppressed. During aldosterone infusion, plasma aldosterone was maintained at around 400 pmol/l. 3. Urinary sodium excretion, lithium clearance and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide increased and plasma renin activity decreased after saline infusion, whether or not aldosterone was infused. However, from 60 to 240 min after saline infusion, natriuresis was significantly less during aldosterone infusion than on the placebo day. In addition, saline loading led to a progressive increase in the ratio of sodium clearance to lithium clearance, used as an index of the fractional distal tubular rejection of sodium, and in the ratio of urinary sodium to potassium. These increases were prevented by the infusion of aldosterone. 4. This study suggests that there are differences in the mechanisms determining the early and the later responses to an acute sodium load. Suppression of aldosterone may explain much of the later increase in natriuresis after saline infusion. In addition, the results are consistent with a role for atrial natriuretic peptide in the immediate increase in sodium excretion after saline loading.\r"

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (mean weight 366 +/- 9 [SE] g) were injected iv at time 0 with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (1 mg/kg, n = 22) or saline (2.5 mL, n = 11). Some animals injected with lipopolysaccharide were pretreated 30 mins before with ibuprofen (15 mg/kg, n = 7). At time 2 hrs, the hearts were harvested and the atria were immersed in tissue baths and attached to force displacement transducers. Blood was collected for measurement of thromboxane B2 (TxB2) by radioimmunoassay. Force of contraction and rate in response to four different preloads were measured. Afterward, the preload was changed to 1 g, and force of contraction and rate were evaluated in response to graded doses of isoproterenol. RESULTS: Force of contraction was significantly (p less than .05) lower at all preloads in animals given lipopolysaccharide. Pretreatment with ibuprofen did not prevent the depression in force of contraction but prevented the increase in TxB2 seen after lipopolysaccharide injection (p less than .05). The force of contraction and rate response to isoproterenol were similar across groups. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that cyclooxygenase products do not mediate lipopolysaccharide-induced cardiac dysfunction in the rat.\r"

  ".W": "It has been shown that during the early phase of lactation porcine milk contains high concentrations of hormones and growth factors. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the hypothesis that the temporal coordination of intestinal maturation in piglets can be extrinsically regulated through changes in the composition of milk during the suckling period. Gut morphology and the ontogeny of brush border lactase activity were investigated in piglets reared on two suckling regimens designed to expose the animals to compositionally distinct milk. The first group of animals were cross-fostered onto postcolostrum sows and thereafter suckled normally for up to eight weeks. These normally suckled (N) animals consequently received both early and late lactation products. The second group of piglets were cross-fostered each week, for up to eight weeks, onto newly farrowed sows which were postcolostrum. As a result of this repeated cross-fostering (CF) these animals received only early lactation products. Animals were sacrificed at one, three, five, seven, and eight weeks postpartum. Biochemically active lactase decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) in both groups over eight weeks, but the rate of loss of activity was greater in the CF animals than in the N pigs by approximately 50% at week 3 and 25% at week 8. Quantitative histochemical analysis of lactase activity corroborated the biochemical data. At three weeks maximal enzyme activity was observed approximately 400 microns from the villus/crypt junction. Histochemically detected lactase decreased throughout the suckling period, but the intensity of reaction product was consistently weaker over the entire villus surface in the CF animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The spontaneous induced release of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) by cultured intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease. In contrast to normal lymphocytes, intestinal lymphocytes from these patients spontaneously released IFN gamma and seemed to contain IFN gamma in their cytoplasm. Autologous peripheral lymphocytes did not release IFN gamma. When stimulated with interferon inducers lamina propria lymphocytes from Crohn's disease tissue showed an increase in IFN gamma release 24 hours after induction with no appreciable further increase over the next two days of culture, while in control cells, either peripheral or intestinal, IFN gamma release progressively increased, peaking 72 hours after induction. These findings indicate that in Crohn's disease the intestinal lymphocytes are stimulated in vivo to produce IFN gamma and that the spontaneous IFN gamma production is compartmentalised to the gut lymphocytes. These data support the concept that locally released IFN gamma has a crucial role in cell interactions in the lamina propria and contribute to the locally occurring immune phenomena in Crohn's disease, including the increased epithelial expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens.\r"

Enzyme activity and isoenzyme composition of three biotransformation systems: glutathione S-transferase, uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyltransferase, and cytochrome P-450 were studied in normal small and large intestinal mucosa from three kidney donors. The activity of most drug-metabolising enzymes decreases slightly from proximal to distal small intestine, whereas in the mucosa of the large intestine a sharp fall in activity was observed. The isoenzyme composition for each of the three biotransformation systems changed from the small to the large intestine. Class Alpha glutathione S-transferases were not expressed in the colon, in contrast to the small intestine where both Alpha and Pi class isoenzymes are present. In addition, with monoclonal antibodies fewer protein bands for UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and cytochrome P-450 were detected in the colon. In the small intestine both isoforms P-450(4) and P-450(5) were present, whereas in the colon only reduced amounts of cytochrome P-450(4) could be visualised. For UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, 53 and 54 kDa proteins could be detected in the small intestine, but in the colon there was only weak staining of the 54 kDa band. In the normal human colon enzymes are less active and there are fewer isoenzymes present in the mucosa than in the small intestine. This implies a lower level of the detoxifying potential in the colon, which might be important in regard to the high rates of carcinogenesis in the colon.\r"

  ".U": "91225196\r", 
  ".W": "To study the ontogeny of spontaneous pulsatile LH and FSH secretion before the onset of puberty, plasma LH and FSH were measured by an ultrasensitive time-resolved immunoflurometric assay in 16 boys and 6 girls, aged 6.5 +/- 0.2 yr (+/- SEM; range, 4.4-8.0) with short stature. Eight male patients with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Kallmann's syndrome), aged 24.1 +/- 3.4 yr, were also investigated. Blood samples were withdrawn at 10- to 20-min intervals for 12 h from 2000-0800 h. Pituitary responsiveness was assessed by a standard iv LHRH challenge test. LH and/or FSH pulses were detectable in all but two prepubertal subjects. In boys, low amplitude LH (0.16 +/- 0.06 U/L) and FSH (0.19 +/- 0.03 U/L) pulses were detectable at mean frequencies of 2.19 +/- 0.37 and 2.13 +/- 0.46 pulses/12 h, respectively. In girls, low amplitude LH (0.29 +/- 0.18 U/L) pulses, but higher (P less than 0.05 compared to boys) amplitude FSH (1.62 +/- 1.05 U/L) pulses were observed at frequencies of 1.71 +/- 0.56 and 1.67 +/- 0.53 pulses/12 h, respectively. Mean FSH in prepubertal girls (1.95 +/- 0.88 U/L) was significantly (P less than 0.05) higher than that in boys (0.46 +/- 0.07 U/L), but mean LH was not different at 0.17 +/- 0.07 and 0.10 +/- 0.03 U/L, respectively. Patients with Kallmann's syndrome had mean LH and FSH levels indistinguishable from those of prepubertal boys. Nocturnal augmentation of pulsatile LH or FSH secretion was observed in 74% of children (71% in girls and 75% in boys), but in none of the eight patients with Kallmann's syndrome. A close temporal association was observed between sleep onset and the appearance of nocturnal pulsatile gonadotropin secretion. The FSH response to exogenous LHRH in prepubertal girls was significantly greater than that in patients with Kallmann's syndrome and prepubertal boys, but LH responses were not different. Our results show that pulsatile LH and FSH secretion occurs in the majority of boys and girls in midchildhood, with a robust association with nocturnal sleep onset. Between the ages of 4-8 yr, these low amplitude and low frequency pulses are unable to activate gonadal function. The regulation of FSH secretion in prepubertal girls appears to be different from that in prepubertal boys.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effects of activin on pituitary FSH biosynthesis have been previously characterized using primary rat pituitary cultures; however, little is known of the effects of activin on FSH biosynthesis and secretion in human pituitary tissue. Production of intact glycoprotein hormones and free subunits is increasingly recognized in pituitary tumors; however, the regulation of gonadotropins in such tumors has not been addressed. We have investigated the effects of human recombinant activin on glycoprotein hormone biosynthesis and secretion in primary cultures of 12 human glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas and compared this with the effects of activin in normal rat anterior pituitary cells. In 33% of the human pituitary tumors studied, significant (P less than 0.05) increases in FSH beta secretion occurred in response to incubation with 20 ng/mL activin for 24 h (19-287% stimulation), without changes in the production of intact FSH. A Northern analysis performed on cells derived from one tumor indicated that FSH beta mRNA levels increased 350% after activin treatments; however, FSH secretion did not parallel the mRNA changes. None of the human glycoprotein hormone-producing tumors significantly increased FSH secretion in response to activin. To validate the biological activity of recombinant human activin-A and to confirm time and dose conditions for the human tumor cultures, we also examined its ability to stimulate FSH production in rat pituitary cultures. Activin (20 ng/mL) added to the culture medium significantly increased FSH secretion and steady state levels of FSH beta mRNA after 24 h. These data indicate that some glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary tumors treated with purified activin have discordant responses of intact gonadotropins and free subunit responses. In contrast to responses in normal rat gonadotrophs, FSH beta biosynthetic pathways may be uncoupled from intact FSH secretion in a subset of glycoprotein hormone-producing pituitary adenomas.\r"

  ".U": "91225203\r", 
  ".W": "Polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) is characterized by hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and altered gonadotropin secretion. Mean plasma FSH concentrations are low, while LH is elevated in a majority of patients. LH pulsatile secretion has been shown to occur at rapid follicular phase frequencies (approximately one pulse per h) in PCO, suggesting persistent rapid frequency GnRH secretion in this disorder. Anovulatory women with PCO were given estradiol (E2; Estraderm skin patches) and progesterone (P; vaginal suppositories) to produce midluteal concentrations for 21 days. The aim was to determine if E2 and P would slow LH (GnRH) pulse frequency and if this would result in augmented FSH secretion and follicular development after withdrawal of E2 and P. Plasma LH was measured every 10 min for 8 h before, during (days 10 and 20), and 7 days after withdrawal of E2 and P (day 28). On each of these study days FSH was measured hourly, and E2 and P were measured every 2 h. After sampling, GnRH (25 and 250 ng/kg, iv) was given to assess pituitary responsiveness. Follicular development was monitored by vaginal ultrasound through day 34 of the study. Basal LH frequency was 8.5 +/- 0.5 pulses/8 h (mean +/- SEM). During E2 and P, LH pulse frequency fell to 3.3 +/- 1.0 (10 days) and 2.3 +/- 0.8 (20 days), 39% and 27% of the basal value, respectively, and subsequently increased to 5.6 +/- 0.7 (66% of basal) 7 days after withdrawal of E2 and P. LH pulse amplitude (basal, 7.2 +/- 1.5 IU/L) was not reduced until day 20, but remained suppressed (3.9 +/- 1.1 IU/L) on day 28. As a result, mean LH (basal, 21.0 +/- 3.5 IU/L) fell progressively during E2 and P, to 3.8 +/- 1.2 IU/L on day 20, and remained low (39% of basal) 7 days after steroid withdrawal. Mean plasma FSH (basal, 7.1 +/- 0.9 IU/L) also fell during steroid administration, but in contrast to LH, had risen to 93% of the basal value by 7 days after E2 and P. LH release in response to exogenous GnRH revealed marked initial responses which did not decrease until day 20, but remained suppressed (8% of basal) after withdrawal of E2 and P. FSH responses were also suppressed on day 20, but had increased to 75% of the basal value by day 28. Initiation of follicular development occurred in all patients, and the lead follicle measured 12.3 +/- 0.8 mm 13 days post-E2 and P. Ovulation occurred in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the effects of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) administration with or without interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) on Graves' and normal thyroid tissue xenografts in the nude mouse (in the absence of an intact immune system) in terms of possible functional, immunological, or histological changes. The dosages of recombinant human IL-2, TNF alpha, and IFN gamma given to each mouse were 250, 800, and 4000 U, respectively; they were injected ip daily for 6 consecutive weeks. The parameters measured included the free T4 index, thyroid autoantibodies, and mouse TSH during the course of the study. Thyroid epithelial cell (TEC) HLA-DR expression was measured in thyroid tissue before xenotransplantation and at death; in addition, light microscopic studies were carried out at those times. There were no significant differences in thyroid function between the results in unstimulated (control) animals and those obtained with cytokine administration in either group of tissues, with the exception of the group receiving TNF alpha together with IFN gamma; in this latter group, the free T4 index declined significantly 4-6 weeks after commencement of treatment in the animals with normal thyroid tissue xenografts. The reduction of thyroid function induced by the combination of IFN gamma and TNF alpha observed in normal thyroid tissue may be due to inhibition of thyroperoxidase and thyroglobulin gene transcription. However, there was no such effect on the Graves' thyroid tissue xenografts, perhaps because of down-regulation of this tissue in response to cytokines, after having been released from long term in vivo immune stimulation. On the other hand, TNF alpha plus IFN gamma induced TEC HLA-DR expression on both types of thyroid xenografts at death, although IL-2 alone did not induce HLA-DR expression, and IFN gamma induced TEC significantly only on normal thyroid xenografts (but not on Graves' xenografts). In light microscopic examination, Graves' thyroid xenografts treated with IL-2 alone or TNF alpha plus IFN gamma appeared normal at death. In addition, normal thyroid xenografts treated with the same cytokines did not show discernible differences compared to those at human surgery or when the xenografts were untreated at death. We conclude that Graves' TEC did not differ from normal TEC in any significant fashion at the time of death, aside from a reduced responsiveness to the stimuli applied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Metabolic clearance and the biological effects of exogenous human atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were assessed in two groups each of eight normal volunteers receiving 2-h iv infusions of ANF (2.5 pmol/kg.min) on the fifth day of dosing with the orally active inhibitor of endopeptidase 24.11, candoxatril (25 mg every 12 h in group 1 and 100 mg every 12 h in group 2), and placebo in balanced randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over experiments. Although 4 days of pretreatment with the endopeptidase inhibitor did not affect basal plasma ANF, candoxatril enhanced mean ANF-induced increases in plasma ANF by 27 pmol/L (P = NS) and 42 pmol/L (P less than 0.002) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Calculated MCRs for ANF were significantly reduced by both doses of candoxatril [group 1, 2.5 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.3 +/- 0.6 L/min (P less than 0.01); group 2, 2.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.6 +/- 0.8 L/min (P less than 0.001)]. ANF significantly enhanced urinary sodium excretion above preinfusion values in both study phases in both groups. Candoxatril significantly further augmented natriuresis in group 2 (P less than 0.01), but not group 1. Inulin clearance was minimally enhanced, and para-aminohippuran clearance was slightly decreased by candoxatril in both groups. Neither effect alone was statistically significant, but derived renal filtration fractions were significantly enhanced in both groups [group 1, 15.5 +/- 0.5% vs. 13.9 +/- 0.6% (P less than 0.01); group 2, 19.3 +/- 1.9% vs. 18.0 +/- 2.7% (P less than 0.01)]. Basal and stimulated cGMP concentrations in both plasma and urine were significantly enhanced by candoxatril in the two groups (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01, respectively, for combined data). Urinary ANF immunoreactivity was significantly enhanced by candoxatril in both groups (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 in groups 1 and 2, respectively), with a more pronounced effect evident at the higher dose (P less than 0.01). These results show that chronic pretreatment with an endopeptidase inhibitor in normal man causes a dose-related reduction in the metabolic clearance of exogenous ANF, amplifies cGMP, and increases renal filtration and the natriuretic responses to infused ANF.\r"

  ".U": "91225216\r", 
  ".W": "We have previously reported that during 2 months of strenuous exercise, untrained young women with documented ovulatory menstrual cycles developed secondary oligoamenorrhea and luteal phase defects. In this study we tested the hypothesis that such abnormalities arise by altered neuroendocrine regulation of menstrual hormone secretion and that weight loss potentiates such effects. We supply a detailed analysis of the 20 cycles, of the total of 53, in which luteal phase abnormalities occurred. During the control month and 2 exercise months, all subjects collected daily overnight urine samples for the determination of LH, FSH, estriol (E3), and free progesterone (P) excretion by RIAs and creatinine by chemical assay. The characteristics of the abnormal luteal phase cycles were determined by comparing the excreted hormone levels and patterns during the control cycles with those of exercise cycles. The area under the curve (AUC) for each hormone was calculated for the follicular and luteal phases of each cycle. Six of the exercise cycles exhibited an inadequate luteal phase. This was characterized by a mean integrated P area of 202.4 (SEM, -61.8) nmol/day.nmol creatinine, compared with 331.7 (SEM, 64.7) during the corresponding control cycles, over a period of 9 or more days after the urinary LH peak to the onset of menses. Fourteen of the exercise cycles exhibited a short luteal phase. This was characterized by a mean integrated P area of 75.9 (30.9) nmol/day.nmol creatinine, compared to 267 (61.7) during the corresponding control cycles, over a span of 8 days or less from the urinary LH peak to the onset of menses. Additional abnormalities occurred only in the short luteal phase cycles. These included an increase in the length and AUC for E3 of the follicular phase and a decrease in the AUC of LH during the luteal phase. We conclude that the initiation of strenuous endurance training in previously ovulating untrained women frequently leads to corpus luteum dysfunction associated with insufficient P secretion and, in the case of short luteal phase cycles, decreased luteal phase length. That exercise may alter the neuroendocrine system is suggested by a delay in the ovulatory LH peak in spite of increased E3 excretion; moreover, less LH is excreted during the luteal phase. The lack of positive feedback to estrogens and decreased LH secretion during the luteal phase could compromise corpus luteum function. In contrast, decreased free P excretion was the sole abnormality noted in menstrual cycles with an inadequate luteal phase.\r"

  ".W": "We performed a nationwide epidemiologic study of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in Japan by questionnaire and found that 835 cases of HP were recognized during the 1980s; 74.4% were summer-type HP, 8.1% farmer's lung, 4.3% ventilation pneumonitis, 4.1% bird fancier's lung, 2.3% other types, such as chemical worker's lung, and 6.8% of unknown causative agent. It was found that the CD4/CD8 ratios of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocytes were significantly different with the type of disease. The ratio was 0.6 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SEM) in summer-type HP (N = 271), 4.4 +/- 0.7 in farmer's lung (N = 22), 1.6 +/- 0.3 in ventilation pneumonitis (N = 19), and 2.0 +/- 0.5 in bird fancier's lung (N = 19). In farmer's lung, the CD4/CD8 ratio in smokers was 6.2 +/- 1.9 (N = 6) in contrast with 3.4 +/- 0.7 for nonsmokers (N = 16) (p less than 0.05). It has been generally considered that the phenotypes of BAL lymphocytes in patients with HP are predominately CD8 cells. Our present results, however, indicate that the phenotypes of BAL lymphocytes vary with the type of HP, probably depending on factors such as causative agent, smoking, or staging of the disease.\r"

Ten adult volunteers with late-phase reactions to the intradermal injection of either Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus or Phleum pratense (timothy) pollen performed a double-blind, crossover study. Each volunteer took astemizole, 10 mg, or identical placebo, daily for 2 weeks. Ag in the concentration that induced a late reaction in the screening visit was injected intradermally at the end of each drug period. The early reaction was measured serially for 30 minutes and the late reaction at 4 and 6 hours. Biopsies of the Ag and control sites were also performed at 6 hours. After a 6-week washout period, subjects then took the opposite medication for 2 weeks and returned for skin testing and biopsy. Skin testing demonstrated that astemizole inhibited the immediate response to both histamine and allergen but had no effect on the late response at 4 hours and at 6 hours. Biopsy specimens revealed no significant effect on eosinophil recruitment at 6 hours. We conclude that histamine H1-receptor blockade has no effect on the late cutaneous reaction to Ag.\r"

The GVHD was manifested by a confluent maculopapular rash and increased liver function tests and was documented by skin biopsy. Separation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells forming rosettes with sheep red blood cells revealed engrafted T cells having the nonrelated HLA type of the blood donor. The patient was treated with intravenous monoclonal anti-T12 in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/day for 5 days. An in vivo effect of the anti-T12 was suggested by clinical improvement of his skin rash and return of the liver transaminases to the normal range. Moreover, human complement components, activated C3 and C4, were detected by fluorescence microscopy on the surfaces of the engrafted CD8+ lymphocytes on the skin biopsy specimens. Also, with a biotin-avadin assay, the presence of the anti-T12 was detected on these same cells. These studies document not only the in vivo targeting of monoclonal anti-T12 antibody to cytotoxic T cells producing GVHD but also the activation of complement on these cells.\r"

Airway response was evaluated as FEV1. After placebo, the geometric mean (GM) provocative concentration causing a 20% in FEV1 from the postsaline baseline value (PC20) for histamine and AMP was 0.63 and 5 mg/ml, respectively. Terfenadine displaced the FEV1 concentration-response curves obtained with both histamine (GM PC20 values increasing to 26.92 mg/ml) and AMP (GM PC20 values increasing to 26.7 mg/ml) to the right. IB had a small, but significant, protective effect against the fall in FEV1 produced by histamine and AMP, the GM PC20 values increasing to 1.69 and to 12.6 mg/ml, respectively. Terfenadine and IB in combination produced protection against histamine and AMP that was more than the production produced by either drug alone, the GM PC20 values increasing to 54.76 and 47.7 mg/ml, respectively. There was no correlation between degree of bronchodilatation induced by active treatments and concentration ratios for AMP or histamine. These data suggest that histamine release and vagal reflexes both contribute to AMP-induced bronchoconstriction in clinical asthma in man.\r"

  ".W": "IgD is thought to function primarily as an Ag receptor that is expressed, together with IgM, only on mature B lymphocytes. This differentiation stage-specific expression of IgD has been well characterized in mice, where delta mRNA is detected only in mature IgM/IgD B cells. Humans, in contrast to mice, have significant levels of serum IgD, suggesting that the regulation of this isotype might differ between the two species. Therefore, we examined the regulation of both IgM and IgD expression in cell lines encompassing the spectrum of human B lineage development. Surprisingly, two species of delta mRNA could be found at all differentiation stages -from mu+ pre-B cell to IgM-secreting plasmablast. These mRNA are translated to yield the membrane and secretory forms of delta. The membrane delta-chain: secretory delta-chain ratio did not necessarily reflect the membrane mu-chain:secretory mu-chain ratio in the same cell line, implying that different mechanisms are involved in the selection of membrane vs secretory mu- and delta-chains. The delta-chains synthesized in pre-B cells were degraded, but in more mature cell types IgD could be stably expressed and secreted. Exceptions to this panlineage synthesis of delta-chains were, however, observed in two of the B cell lymphomas, where delta expression was prevented by transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. The presence of delta-chain in pre-B cells and the secretion of IgD by more mature cells suggest that IgD may have immunoregulatory roles throughout B cell differentiation. These studies also indicated that the bias toward secretory mu-chain production that occurs in human IgM secreting cells results from posttranscriptional regulation. In addition, we have identified a B cell line that synthesizes both normal-sized mu-chains and those with smaller apparent m.w. translation products of truncated mu mRNA.\r"

  ".W": "The SJL strain of mice possess a unique developmental delay in the ability to exhibit delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses after immunization with a wide variety of Ag. Similar to other models of DTH, the adoptive transfer of syngeneic Ag-pulsed macrophages from DTH-responsive mice into these DTH-unresponsive mice results in the activation of Ag-specific, CD4+ DTH effector Th1 T cells. The absence of other defects in APC-dependent immune responses indicate that the macrophages is the sole APC required for the induction of DTH effector T cells in SJL mice. The defect occurs during the sensitization phase of the DTH response; however, it has not been determined whether a Th cell, which is required for the induction of CD4+ DTH effector T cells, was present in the DTH unresponsive SJL mice. In this study, we have determined that the Thy-1+ helper cell is induced upon Ag stimulation of nonresponder mice and present evidence for the existence of an accessory cell distinct from the macrophage that induces CD4+ DTH effector T cells. Our data indicate that CD4+ DTH effector T cells are induced in an Ag-specific and MHC-restricted manner by an adherent macrophage that expresses the Mac-1+, Mac-2-, Mac-3+, I-A+ phenotype. Adoptive transfer of as few as 100 of the Mac-1+, Mac-2-, or Mac-3+ subsets from DTH responsive donors to DTH unresponsive recipients is able to overcome the DTH deficit. The activation of CD4+ DTH effector T cells in the SJL mouse cells also requires a Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, helper cell. In contrast to the Mac-1+, Mac-3+, I-A+ accessory cell, this helper cell requires an adherent, irradiation resistant, accessory cell that expresses the Mac-1+, Mac-2-, Mac-3-, I-A- surface phenotype for activation. Further, the interaction between this accessory cell and the Thy-1+ helper cell is neither Ag-specific nor MHC restricted. This is the first demonstration of an accessory cell requirement for the Thy-1+, Lyt-1+, B220-, CD4-, CD8-, CD3- DTH Th cell. These data indicate that the activation of the triple negative helper cells and subsequent activation of the CD4+ effector T cells are regulated by two distinct macrophage subpopulations.\r"

  ".W": "Some thymocytes, upon activation via the TCR complex in vitro, undergo apoptotic cell death. In this report, we examine the cell death induced in the thymus after administration of anti-CD3 or anti-TCR antibodies. We found that shortly after antibody injection, cortical thymocytes undergo apoptosis as characterized by morphologic changes and DNA fragmentation. Anti-CD3 administration led to depletion of nearly all CD4+CD8+ thymocytes, and approximately 50% of CD4+CD8- thymocytes. This depletion predominantly affected cells bearing low levels of CD3, although some depletion also occurred among cells expressing intermediate and high levels. Administration of an anti-TCR antibody also induced apoptosis, but affected significantly fewer thymocytes than anti-CD3. This effect was probably not due to different binding affinities for the two antibodies, because both antibodies show similar dose response effects in an in vitro model of activation-induced apoptosis. This work demonstrates that findings on activation-induced apoptosis in vitro can be extended to the in vivo situation, and further, that the activation of cortical thymocytes, in situ, results in apoptosis and removal of the activated cells. The possible relationships between this activation-induced cell death in immature thymocytes and the process of negative selection of autoreactive T cells is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "The regulation of Ig production by human B lymphocytes is a complex process involving interactions among B cells, APC, T lymphocytes and soluble factors including activation, growth, and differentiation factors. Components of the complement system, including C3a, C3b, C3d, and C5a, have been shown to influence various stages in this process. In this study, we demonstrate that the C1q subcomponent of complement binds to both small resting and large activated B cells and stimulates immunoglobulin production by Staphylococcus aureus Cowan-activated tonsillar B lymphocytes. This effect is present whether C1q is added to the B cells either at the beginning or near the end of a 7-day culture period and is not associated with enhancement of proliferation. The C1q stimulation of Ig production is, however, associated with increased steady state levels of mRNA for the mu Ig H chain. Furthermore, C1q stimulated IgM production by the human B cell line SKW 6.4, which is capable of secreting IgM in response to B cell differentiation factors (BCDF). SLE is a disorder frequently associated with polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes. We studied the effect of C1q on B cells from two patients with this disorder and one with an SLE-like illness, all selected for the predominance of either IgM or IgG in serum. Spontaneous or BCDF-stimulated Ig secretion was of the isotype predominant in vivo, whereas C1q selectively stimulated B cells to produce the other isotype (IgG vs IgM). Thus, C1q interacts with B lymphocytes in a manner distinct from that of BCDF found in mixed lymphocyte supernatants. C1q may be an important factor influencing the production of Ig by B lymphocytes in normal individuals and in patients with abnormalities of B cell activity.\r"

By preincubating APC with IL-10, we demonstrate that IL-10 acts principally on APC to inhibit IFN-gamma production by Th1 clones. Moreover, IL-10 is not active when Th1 cells are stimulated with glutaraldehyde-fixed APC, which also indicates that its action involves regulation of APC function. Furthermore, IL-10 inhibits cytokine synthesis by Th1 cells stimulated with the super-antigen Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, which does not appear to require processing. Flow microfluorimetry purified splenic or peritoneal B cells and macrophages, and B cell and macrophage cell lines can present Ag to Th1 clones. However, IL-10 acts only on sorted macrophages and the macrophage cell line to suppress IFN-gamma production by Th1 clones. IL-10 does not show this effect when B cells are used as APC. In contrast, IL-10 does not impair the ability of APC to stimulate cytokine production by Th2 cells. IL-10 does not decrease IFN-gamma-induced I-Ad levels on a macrophage cell line. Inasmuch as IL-10 also inhibits IL-2-induced IFN-gamma production by Th1 cells in an Ag-free system requiring only the presence of accessory cells, these data suggest that IL-10 may inhibit macrophage accessory cell function which is independent of TCR-class II MHC interactions.\r"

Supernatants from various thymocyte subsets activated with calcium ionophore and PMA were tested for these cytokines. All CD3hi thymocyte subsets (CD4+8-, CD4-8- and CD4-8+) produced high titers of these four cytokines except CD3+4-8+ thymocytes, which did not produce IL-4. In contrast, CD4+8+ thymocytes did not produce any detectable cytokines. CD3-4-8- thymocytes produced IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha (but not IL-4) when activated by calcium ionophore + PMA and IL-1. We then separated CD3-4-8- thymocytes into IL-2R+ and IL-2R-. CD3-4-8-IL-2R+ thymocytes only produced small amounts of IL-2 when activated with calcium ionophore + PMA + IL-1, whereas CD3-4-8-IL-2R- thymocytes did not require IL-1 to produce IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Finally, CD4-8+3- thymocytes (an immature population believed to be an intermediate between CD3-4-8- and CD4+8+ thymocytes) only produced marginally detectable levels of IL-2 upon stimulation with calcium ionophore, PMA, and the addition of IL-1 did not result in increased levels of cytokine production. These observations indicate discrete patterns of cytokine production by the subsets studied and suggest specific controls of cytokine gene expression during T cell development.\r"

In this report, we show that the macrophage activating agents, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and LPS, are all potent inhibitors of CSF-1-stimulated murine bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMM) DNA synthesis and increase in cell numbers. The inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma do not appear to be due to endotoxin contamination in the recombinant cytokine preparations. The inhibition of proliferation is reversible and is not due to a general loss of growth factor responsiveness, inasmuch as the three agents do not inhibit CSF-1-stimulated BMM survival, protein synthesis, or fluid phase pinocytosis. Because TNF-alpha and LPS are known to rapidly and potently down-modulate CSF-1 receptor levels in BMM, the results also suggest that low levels of receptor occupancy are sufficient for biological responses to CSF-1. The inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, or LPS were also seen when granulocyte-macrophage-CSF or IL-3 was used to stimulate BMM DNA synthesis. The results suggest that TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and LPS appear to be inhibiting CSF-stimulated proliferation by acting at a post-receptor level, possibly by regulation of some critical event(s) in the mitogenic signaling pathway.\r"

In addition, using a mitogen-induced proliferation assay of human peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes, we show that GCS-mediated anti-proliferative effects are not blocked by rIL-1, rIL-2, rIL-3, rIL-4, rIL-5, rIL-6, rTNF-alpha, rTNF-beta, and rIFN-gamma, individually at 1 to 1000 U/ml, but are totally abrogated, in a concentration-dependent fashion, by the combination of rIL-1, rIL-6, and rIFN-gamma (25 to 50 U/ml for each cytokine). Thus, blockade of cytokine expression is the primary mechanism by which GCS inhibit mitogen-driven and alloantigen-induced T cell proliferation. The immunosuppressive effects of GCS are almost certainly exacted at the level of cytokine gene transcription.\r"

By contrast, guanosine 5'-o-2-thiophosphate, almost completely inhibited IP3 generation induced by cross-linking with anti-CD16 mAb. Pretreatment of NK cells with 10 to 100 ng/ml Vibrio cholerae toxin (Ctx) almost completely inhibited the generation of IP3 and of other Ipn as well as Fc gamma RIII-operated cell functions such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against antibody-coated P815 mastocytoma cells. Isolated B subunit of Ctx was inactive. Bordetella pertussis toxin (0.1 to 1 microgram/ml) only marginally affected IP3 release and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Ctx increased cAMP levels in NK cells. However, inhibition of IP3 release preceded the rise of cAMP. Moreover, cAMP analogues (8-chlor-cAMP, 8-bromo-cAMP, dibutiryl-cAMP), as well as intracellular cAMP-enhancing agents (PGE1, PGE2, and forskolin) did not mimicked the effects of Ctx on IP3 generation, suggesting that the adenylate cyclase pathway is not responsible for the early effects of Ctx on Fc gamma RIII-mediated signalling. Overall these results demonstrate that signal transduction via Fc gamma RIII is mediated by Ctx-sensitive cellular membrane GTP-binding protein.\r"

  ".W": "In murine infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, immune responsiveness to parasite and non-parasite Ag becomes suppressed during the acute phase of infection, and this suppression is known to extend to the production of IL-2. To determine whether suppression of lymphokine production was specific for IL-2, or was a generalized phenomenon involving suppressed production of other lymphokines, we have begun an investigation of the ability of mice to produce of a number of lymphokines during infection, initially addressing this question by studying IFN-gamma production. Supernatants from Con A-stimulated spleen cells from infected resistant (C57B1/6) and susceptible (C3H) mice were assayed for IFN-gamma. Supernatants known to be suppressed with respect to IL-2 production from both mouse strains contained IFN-gamma at or above that of supernatants from normal spleen cells. Samples were assayed in an IFN bioassay to ensure that the IFN-gamma detected by ELISA was biologically active. Thus, suppression during T. cruzi infection does not extend to the production of all lymphokines. The stimulation of IFN-gamma production was confirmed by detection of IFN-gamma mRNA in unstimulated spleen cells from infected animals, and in Con A, Con A + PMA, and in some cases, parasite Ag-stimulated spleen cells from infected animals. IFN-gamma mRNA levels in mitogen-stimulated spleen cells equalled or exceeded those found in similarly stimulated normal cells. In contrast, stimulated spleen cells from infected animals had reduced levels of IL-2 mRNA relative to normal spleen cells. Thus at both the protein and mRNA level, IFN-gamma production is stimulated by T. cruzi infection, whereas IL-2 production is suppressed. Serum IFN-gamma in infected C57B1/6 and C3H mice was detected 8 days after infection, peaked on day 20 of infection, and subsequently fell, but remained detectable at low levels throughout the life of infected mice. Infected animals were depleted of cell populations known to be capable of producing IFN-gamma, and Thy-1+, CD4-, CD8-, NK- cells, and to a lesser degree, CD4+ and CD8+ cells were found to be responsible for the production of IFN-gamma during infection. We also report that IL-2 can induce IFN-gamma production in vitro and in vivo by spleen cells from infected animals, and that IL-2 can synergize with epimastigote or trypomastigote antigen to produce high levels of IFN-gamma comparable to those found in supernatants from mitogen-stimulated cells.\r"

  ".W": "Using a murine model, we investigated the role of the bacterial exotoxin listeriolysin O (LLO) in cellular immunity to Listeria monocytogenes. A correlation between LLO production by infecting bacteria and generation of protective immunity to virulent LLO-producing bacteria was noted. Using isogeneic hemolysin (Hly+ or Hly-) strains of L. monocytogenes, we demonstrated that LLO production by infecting bacteria is required to elicit T cells reactive both to bacteria-associated Ag and to the secreted LLO molecule as measured by IL-2 production in vitro. Distinct sets of T cells specific for largely nonoverlapping pools of antigenic determinants represented by LLO and cell-associated Ag (heat-killed L. monocytogenes) are generated after infection. We have used models for prediction of T cell epitopes based on primary structure of LLO, and synthetic amphipathic LLO peptides were evaluated as Ag in vitro or as immunogenes in vivo. Infection of several strains of mice (H-2k and H-2d) with LLO-producing L. monocytogenes resulted in the generation of T cells that could respond consistently to two peptides, LLO 215-234 and LLO 354-371. Mouse strains lacking expression of I-E molecules (e.g., B10.A(4R) and C57BL/6) responded to LLO but not to the peptides tested. With C3HeB/FeJ mice, antibodies to I-Ek blocked the presentation of LLO 215-234. The importance of the N-terminal portion of LLO 215-234 was evidenced by the drastic reduction in antigenic activity of truncated peptides (e.g., LLO 221-234 and LLO 224-234). LLO 215-234, the strongest and most consistent activator of T cells from L. monocytogenes-immune mice, fit well some models for antigenic peptides in several ways. It could be predicted to form an amphipathic alpha-helix, it contained multiple \"Rothbard motifs\" (charged residue or glycine, two or three hydrophobic amino acids and then a glycine or polar residue), it had a net charge of +2, and it contained the correct spacing of amino acids (five to six residues between a hydrophobic and basic amino acid) that is characteristic of I-Ek-binding peptides. Immunization with 8 of 10 synthetic LLO peptides generated T cells that recognized the immunizing peptide in vitro, but such T cells were only poorly reactive with LLO. Our results indicate that LLO is an important target Ag for stimulation of CD4+ L. monocytogenes-specific T cells, and that LLO 215-234 is antigenically dominant in C3HeB/FeJ mice.\r"

Irrespective of the parasite inocula (100 or 25,000), groups of antibody-treated mice had significantly greater cumulative mortality rates than did appropriate controls. In antibody-treated mice, mean survival times were also significantly shorter, and maximum mean parasitemia levels were significantly higher, than in controls. Moreover, the number of amastigote nests in tissues was higher than in control mice and attained a maximum at the same time as parasitemia. As evident from kinetic studies of neutralizing activity, injected mAb were rapidly consumed in infected, but not in noninfected, mice, which is suggestive of massive IFN-gamma production during the early parasitemic phase of the disease. Nevertheless, IFN-gamma remained undetectable in the sera of infected but untreated mice. Unexpectedly, however, a peak of IFN-like antiviral activity, characterizable as a mixture of IFN-gamma and IFN-beta, appeared in mAb-treated mice that survived to infection at a time when neutralizing activity of injected mAb had drastically decreased in the circulation. We hypothesize that this high level of artificially induced endogenous IFN-gamma, not neutralized by the amounts of injected mAb, was due to the more intense parasite multiplication occurring in mAb-treated mice, which in turn may have induced an increased amount of various cytokines. TNF-alpha was not found in the serum of our mice. The humoral immune response entered its exponential phase at a time point later than that when protection by endogenous IFN-gamma was evident. Treatment with IFN-gamma-specific antibody, as applied in our study, failed to affect the level of different Ig isotypes or of T. cruzi-specific antibodies. Our study clearly indicates that IFN-gamma is produced early in acute T. cruzi infection and exerts a protective effect that is probably independent from the humoral immune response.\r"

A cloned VH4 probe detected an average of 10 hybridizing BgIII restriction fragments in genomic DNA derived from 75 unrelated individuals and a total of 15 distinct bands. Of these 15 restriction fragments, 12 were polymorphic, as demonstrated by band absence in some individuals. Oligonucleotide probes specific to CDR1 and CDR2 sequences of known VH4 genes detected limited numbers of bands and revealed sequence polymorphisms that correlated with several of the RFLP detected by the cloned probe. The prevalence of the individual polymorphic restriction fragments was highly variable, ranging from 1% to 97%, with a mean prevalence of 51%. These values resemble those previously observed among VH3 elements. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium suggests that most VH4 gene segments are in genetic equilibrium. These results indicate that the VH4 loci, like those of VH3, are dominated by relatively few, perhaps two to four, alleles/locus and further suggest that the haplotype organization of the human VH locus is very complex.\r"

The frequency of mutations was determined for different sections of the intron and compared with the frequencies of mutations found in the JC intron of a set of VJ kappa 5 alleles. The results showed that mutations were concentrated in and around the rearranged VJ, regardless of whether J kappa 1 or J kappa 5 was used.

  ".W": "Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been cultured from a variety of human tumors, and some melanoma TIL have demonstrated specific, MHC-restricted recognition of autologous tumor in short term lysis assays. The current study investigates cytokine release by TIL as an indicator of specific tumor recognition. We have identified two of four melanoma and one of seven breast carcinoma TIL cultures that specifically release granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma after autologous tumor stimulation. The other cultures either do not secrete cytokine or secrete cytokine in a nonspecific fashion. The amount of specific cytokine released is directly related to the number of TIL and stimulating tumor cells. Studies of TIL, from two melanoma patients, separated into CD4+ and CD8+ populations revealed that CD8+ cells were responsible for virtually all of the specific cytokine secretion, although both populations released cytokines when activated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Specific cytokine release by CD8+ TIL was inhibited by anti-MHC class I mAb. Specific cytokine release was also detected from a CD4+ breast cancer TIL culture, and this was inhibited by anti-MHC class II mAb. The clinical significance of this specific mode of immune antitumor reactivity is currently under investigation.\r"

Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen and activity were measured before and after venous occlusion. In the high risk group, tPA activity was significantly lower both before and after venous occlusion and PAI-1 levels were significantly higher. In a multivariate analysis the triglyceride levels, diastolic blood pressure and cholesterol levels were independently associated with the PAI-1 levels. Diastolic blood pressure was independently and inversely associated with resting tPA activity. We conclude that patients with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia have a reduced activity of the fibrinolytic system, an effect which is unrelated to differences in age, sex, smoking or BMI.\r"

Blood samples were collected for assessment of serum lipids and haemostatic variables in the plasma. Both experimental diets caused serum triglycerides and plasma factor VIIc to decline to the same extent. The meat diet was also associated with significant changes in plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen. PA inhibitor type I (PAI-1) antigen, PAI activity, and t-PA activity of the euglobulin fraction of plasma. The fish diet left these variables unchanged from initial values. Thus, in a paired comparison of the two diets, the fish diet was associated with higher levels of t-PA antigen (5.4 vs. 4.7 g ml-1), which is considered to be beneficial with regard to prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, the fish diet was concurrently associated with the putative unfavourable higher levels of PAI-1 antigen (3.0 vs. 1.2 ng ml-1) and PAI activity (6.1 vs. 3.2 IU ml-1), and lower t-PA activity (80 vs. 140 mIU ml-1). Thus it is unclear which of the two diets has the greatest potential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\r"

  ".W": "Circulating organ-specific autoantibodies are serological markers of destruction or impairment of the relevant endocrine tissue cells and may be associated with abnormal hormone levels with or without clinical evidence of overt disease. We sought organ-specific cardiac antibodies in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy because of increasing evidence that the heart has endocrine characteristics (secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP] and other peptide hormones). Serum samples from 166 patients with polyendocrinopathy, 80 with autoimmunity confined to one gland, and 200 healthy blood donors were tested for these antibodies by means of immunofluorescence on human heart. Skeletal muscle was used to identify cross-reacting antibodies. Organ-specific cardiac antibodies were detected in significantly more of the patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy (28 [17%]) than of those with autoimmunity confined to one gland (1 [1%]) or of normal subjects (7 [3.5%]; p = 0.0001). Among the patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy, the prevalence of systemic hypertension was higher in those with cardiac autoantibodies than in those without (5/28 [18%] vs 2/80 [3%]; p = 0.01); the same was true for a family history of hypertension (11 [42%] vs 5 [7%]; p = 0.0001). There were no significant differences in mean basal or stimulated ANP concentrations between patients with or without antibodies or between patients and controls. 5 of the 22 antibody-positive patients had ANP concentrations outside the normal range, but these disturbances were not associated with systemic hypertension or a family history of the disorder. Patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy can have organ-specific cardiac antibodies, which may represent novel serological markers for an autoimmune form of systemic hypertension in the absence of overt cardiac disease.\r"

  ".W": "One or more of three Gi proteins, Gi1-3, mediates hormonal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Whether this inhibition is mediated by the alpha or by the beta gamma subunits of Gi proteins is unclear. Mutations inhibiting the intrinsic GTPase activity of another G protein, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase (Gs), constitutively activate it by replacing either of two conserved amino acids in its alpha subunit (alpha s). These mutations create the gsp oncogene which is found in human pituitary and thyroid tumours. In a second group of human endocrine tumours, somatic mutations in the alpha subunit of Gi2 replace a residue cognate to one of those affected by gsp mutations. This implies that the mutations convert the alpha i2 gene into a dominantly acting oncogene, called gip2, and that the mutant alpha i2 subunits are constitutively active. We have therefore assessed cyclic AMP accumulation in cultured cells which stably or transiently express exogenous wild-type alpha i2 complementary DNA or either of two mutant alpha i2 cDNAs. The results show that putatively oncogenic mutations in alpha i2 constitutively activate the protein's ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation.\r"

  ".W": "There is increasing evidence that human papillomaviruses (HPV) have a casual role in some neoplasms in human beings. As examples, DNA of HPV types 16, 18, and 31 are frequently present in genital cancers in humans. Recently, oncogenic HPV types have also been identified in neoplasms of the head and neck, including verrucous carcinoma of the larynx, squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and larynx, and inverted papillomas of the nose. These findings and our resource of an extensive panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines led us to begin to investigate how frequently HPV DNA was present in these tumor cell lines. For initial analysis, twenty-two HNSCC cell lines derived from 20 patients' tumors were selected as representative of our tumor cell line panel with respect to diversity of primary site, tumor stage, patient age, sex, and clinical course. For Southern analysis, cell line DNA was tested for hybridization with DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 31. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was also performed on five tumor cell lines using types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 52 as probes. Southern blot analysis revealed HPV-specific signals in two of the 22 HNSCC cell lines tested. One of these, UM-SCC-23, was HPV 31 positive, which to our knowledge is the first identification of HPV 31 in HNSCC. UM-SCC-63, the other HPV-positive tumor identified by Southern analysis, hybridized with both type 18 and 31. Of the five tumor cell lines tested with PCR, two were HPV positive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "The effect of chronic intrascalar electrical stimulation on the spiral ganglion cell survival of the ototoxically deafened guinea pig was investigated. Immediately after ototoxic drug administration, unilateral sinusoidal (1 kHz) charge-balanced electrical stimulation on a 50% duty cycle was administered for 2 hours per day, 5 days per week, at intensities from 0 (control) to 400 microAmp via an implanted scala tympani electrode. The relationship of electrically evoked middle latency response (EMLR) to stimulation protocol and cell survival was studied. At 9 weeks post-drug treatment, the animals were killed and temporal bones were prepared for morphometric analysis of spiral ganglion cell density. The subjects showed essentially complete elimination of outer hair sensory cells, with minimal remaining inner hair cells confined to apical turns. Variable loss of spiral ganglion cell populations was observed, which related to electrical stimulation. In animals that received daily unilaterally electrical stimulation, statistically significant increases in survival of spiral ganglion cells were observed in the stimulated ear, compared to the nonstimulated ear-particularly in basal cochlear regions near the electrode. Spiral ganglion cell density was a function of stimulation current intensity level. Moreover, the slope of the amplitude input/output (I/O) function of the EMLR was found to be dependent on stimulating current level. The effect of stimulation on induced survival may be dependent on a number of mechanisms, including metabolic effects of direct activation of \"deafferented\" spiral ganglion cells. These data support the suggestion that implantation may provide optimal benefits when performed shortly after deafness.\r"

  ".W": "Labyrinthitis ossificans may be a hindrance to cochlear implantation by making electrode insertion difficult. We performed a histopathologic study of 24 temporal bones with labyrinthitis ossificans from multiple causes. The organ of Corti was graphically reconstructed and the degree of obstruction was estimated for each millimeter of the cochlea. Correlations were calculated between the degree of new bone formation and the cause, patient's age and sex, and time from the original temporal bone insult. Our results demonstrate that complete cochlear ossification is rare. The scala tympani in the basal turn of the cochlea is the most frequent area of ossification, regardless of the cause of the labyrinthitis ossificans. Meningogenic labyrinthitis, usually a childhood disease, was associated with the greatest amount of ossification. When ossification resulted from tympanogenic labyrinthitis, the scala tympani was completely ossified near the round window niche in all temporal bones. Neo-ossification of the basal turn associated with otosclerosis was limited to the proximal 6 mm of the scala tympani in all cases. Three temporal bones had a patent round window niche and basal turn, but significant apical and middle-turn ossification. Peripheral sensorineural elements were severely degenerated in the region of the ossification in all specimens, and spiral ganglion cell counts were decreased.\r"

  ".U": "91227026\r", 
  ".W": "Nine hundred ninety-five cases of melanoma of the head and neck were divided into two groups so that certain comparisons could be made concerning the behavior of melanoma over a 55-year period. One hundred twelve melanomas of the ocular system were excluded from this review. The first group consisted of 660 melanomas seen during a period from 1932 to 1972. The second group consisted of 223 melanomas seen during a period from 1973 to 1987. Thirteen parameters, including sex, age, distribution, pre-existing mole, amelanotic melanoma, delay in diagnosis, classification, levels, local recurrence, regional metastasis, systemic metastasis, morbidity, and survival, were studied to assess the behavior and the variations. There is no question that the most important aspect of the favorable changes that have occurred are because of earlier diagnosis and better management by a larger group of well-trained specialists. There are some subtler changes that could possibly indicate biologic alterations, but this requires more time and study to substantiate.\r"

Only half the patients reported a history of swallowing problems at the time of their acute poliomyelitis. Each patient received a videofluorographic evaluation of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, and then was provided with recommendations to improve swallowing skills. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to all patients. The respondents had an average interval of 12 months since the initial evaluation. Of the 18 patients responding to the questionnaire, 14 (77%) reported regular use of the swallowing suggestions. Comparison of pre-evaluation results to followup of the 18 respondents yielded a statistically significant decline in the frequency of choking (p = 0.0156) and food sticking in the throat (p = 0.0195). We conclude that a dysphagia program can result in significant improvement of the swallowing symptoms reported with the post-polio population.\r"

  ".U": "91227028\r", 
  ".W": "The modified barium swallow is currently the most comprehensive, widely available, and easily interpreted technique for the evaluation of patients with dysphagia by the head and neck surgeon. However, it requires the facilities, personnel, and use of a radiology suite, a trained speech pathologist, and exposure of the patient to radiation. It would therefore be helpful to have an adjunctive, physician based, nonradiographic method of examination that could provide information similar to and possibly even more complete than that supplied by the modified barium swallow. Such an adjunctive method could help otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons confronted by a new patient with swallowing difficulties to orient themselves to the nature and severity of the problem while waiting for the modified barium swallow to be scheduled, performed, and reviewed. It could also be a helpful tool for management of patients with cancer of the head and neck, whose swallowing function may change rapidly in the early postoperative period. In such cases, intervals between modified barium swallow examinations (dictated by concern over radiation exposure) may be too far apart to allow up-to-the-minute decisions on case management. Finally, some patients who may be too ill to travel to the radiology suite might benefit from a bedside procedure that would yield information about swallowing function similar to that provided by the modified barium swallow. Videoendoscopic evaluation of dysphagia (VEED) is a protocol I developed and have used regularly since 1984. Experience with this method of dysphagia evaluation has shown that it answers the needs outlined above. Its usefulness also goes beyond that of the modified barium swallow by providing a more detailed understanding of the component anatomic and functional deficits that comprise a given patient's swallowing problem, information about upper aerodigestive tract sensory deficits, and a means for visual feedback training of pharyngeal and laryngeal musculature. The protocol is reviewed here. Case reports illustrating the clinical usefulness of VEED as an adjunct to the modified barium swallow are also presented, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of VEED and the modified barium swallow are compared.\r"

Mice were killed at 3-week intervals, and the oral cavity, mandible, and neck were sectioned and examined histologically. Tumor growth was observed in 65% of the animals, with histologic features consistent with the engrafted human invasive SCC. These features included invasion of connective tissue in 92%, invasion of muscle in 77%, invasion and destruction of bone in 54%, and vascular invasion in 15% of the mice. In contrast, FOM tumor implanted subcutaneously on back sites of nude mice was totally encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue with evidence of capsular invasion. SCC from other head and neck sites showed similar locally invasive growth after intraoral implantation in nude mice. The results demonstrate the invasive characteristics of human head and neck SCC grown in the homologous oral cavity site in nude mice and support the nude mouse as a biologically relevant in vivo model in the investigation of the biologic characteristics and therapy of head and neck carcinoma.\r"

At present, the family is known to contain at least sixteen different genes that encode the alpha subunit of the heterotrimer, four that encode beta subunits, and multiple genes encoding gamma subunits. Specific transient interactions between these components generate the pathways that modulate cellular responses to complex chemical signals.\r"

This characteristic pattern is largely specified by the zebra element located immediately upstream of the ftz transcriptional start site. The FTZ-F1 protein, one of multiple DNA binding factors that interacts with the zebra element, is implicated in the activation of ftz transcription, especially in stripes 1, 2, 3, and 6. An FTZ-F1 complementary DNA has been cloned by recognition site screening of a Drosophila expression library. The identity of the FTZ-F1 complementary DNA clone was confirmed by immunological cross-reaction with antibodies to FTZ-F1 and by sequence analysis of peptides from purified FTZ-F1 protein. The predicted amino acid sequence of FTZ-F1 revealed that the protein is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. This finding raises the possibility that a hormonal ligand affects the expression of a homeobox segmentation gene early in embryonic development.\r"

The predominant locality of symptomatic OLF was at the thoracolumbar junction, particularly at T10-11 followed by T11-12. At the level of the thickest OLF in each patient, there were three types of OLF from computed tomography and operative findings: a lateral type in 3 patients, diffuse in 8, and thickened nodular in 3. The diagnosis of OLF-related thoracic spinal canal stenosis was best made by enhanced computed tomography. Histologic study revealed that the developmental mode of OLF was mainly endochondral ossification. Numerous fibrocartilaginous cells were found in the increased and swollen collagen fibers forming the hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (HLF). Ossification extended along the superficial layer of HLF. The size or extension of OLF was relevant to the corresponding diathesis of spinalhyperostosis. Results of laminectomy for OLF were poor because of the high occurrence of complications early on or later deterioration. Therefore, laminoplasty is recommended as a successful procedure for OLF-related thoracic myelopathy, avoiding further local mechanical stress due to tensile force.\r"

Ninety-seven children were randomized. Forty-seven were assigned to the AGC regimen and 50 received CC. Forty-two patients in the AGC group had an appropriate therapeutic outcome, whereas 48 of 50 children who received CC completed the trial successfully (p = NS). There were no differences between the groups with reference to the duration of antibiotic administration, fever, leukocytosis or length of hospitalization. Complications of therapy were uncommon and neither regimen demonstrated a significant advantage from an economic standpoint. We concluded that, in childhood, complicated appendicitis can be treated with either CC or AGC with equal efficacy.\r"

  ".W": "The reduction in peritoneal plasminogen activator activity (believed to be the pathogenic mechanism of adhesion formation) and its replacement with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have been investigated in the prevention of initial (primary) and recurrent adhesion production. Other, potentially harmful, effects of intra-abdominal rt-PA application have also been examined. This included effects on wound and colonic healing and hemostasis. The prevention of adhesion formation was studied in primary and recurrent adhesion formation using a rabbit model. Primary adhesions formed in one of 14 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 12 of 15 occasions (80 per cent) with placebo (chi-square equals 15.542, p less than 0.001). Recurrent adhesions formed on two of 27 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 22 of 28 occasions with placebo (79 per cent) and 12 of 12 occasions with control rabbits (100 per cent, chi-square equals 40.588, p less than 0.0001). The application of rt-PA to abdominal wounds in the rabbit failed to show any reduction in wound strength at four, seven and ten days. Colonic anastomotic healing was unaltered by rt-PA at three, five and seven days. There was no difference seen in hemorrhagic events between control, placebo or rt-PA rabbits at any stage. The use of rt-PA is an exciting development in the field of adhesion prevention; it is an effective inhibitor of adhesion formation and intra-abdominal administration appears safe in a rabbit model.\r"

  ".W": "It is the practice of some gynecologists and general surgeons to preoperatively evaluate the colon with a barium enema (BE) examination to exclude potential intestinal involvement or coexistent disease in patients undergoing pelvic or hernia operations. This practice appears to be based on anecdotal data with few studies specifically evaluating its usefulness. We retrospectively evaluated the records of 190 patients at William Beaumont Army Medical Center during 1986 to 1987 who received a preoperative BE prior to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) or inguinal hernia repair (IHR). The tumor registry charts of 59 patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the colon and rectum during the same period were also cross-checked to determine if any were detected during preoperative evaluation for TAH or IHR. BE findings were considered significant if they altered surgical management or asymptomatic carcinoma was detected. Of 86 patients screened before TAH by BE, eight had abnormal findings with subsequent colonoscopy revealing four with adenomatous polyps, one of which required surgical resection. Of 104 patients screened before IHR by BE, 15 had abnormal findings with subsequent colonoscopy revealing five patients with adenomatous polyps and two with adenocarcinoma. Screening preoperative BE had a low yield of clinically significant findings, which was even lower in the subgroup with carcinoma. There was no apparent relationship between findings and age in our study. Our results suggest that the use of routine preoperative BE has a low yield and should be performed only if clinical symptoms or findings suggest a need for this study.\r"

While the hypothalamus and circumventricular organs contribute to sodium and intravascular volume regulation, their influence on atrial natriuretic factor is not known. We tested the hypothesis that, following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suprasellar cisternal blood, intraventricular blood, or ventricular enlargement would be associated with elevated plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor. Computed tomograms of 26 patients performed less than or equal to 3 days after hemorrhage were analyzed to determine the presence of suprasellar or intraventricular blood and enlargement of the third or lateral ventricle. These results were correlated with the plasma atrial natriuretic factor and serum sodium concentrations. The initial atrial natriuretic factor concentration was elevated and was higher in patients with suprasellar or intraventricular blood than in those without (suprasellar: 131 +/- 20 and 54 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively; intraventricular: 137 +/- 25 and 84 +/- 31 pg/ml, respectively). The atrial natriuretic factor concentration remained higher over the week following hemorrhage in patients with suprasellar blood than in those without (127 +/- 16 and 68 +/- 12 pg/ml, respectively). The atrial natriuretic factor concentration was not correlated with hyponatremia (125-134 meq/l) or age-corrected ventricular size. Hyponatremia did not correlate with the presence of intraventricular or suprasellar blood. Our data suggest that suprasellar and intraventricular blood disturb hypothalamic function, resulting in an elevated plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration. The presence of a direct relation between atrial natriuretic factor and hyponatremia remains unclear.\r"

  ".W": "Altered metabolism has been shown to exist in the settings of surgical stress, cancer, cirrhosis, sepsis, and trauma. Each condition is characterized by varying degrees of alteration in metabolic processes, and within a given patient, these metabolic alterations will change as the patient's status changes. Nutrition support is an integral part of the metabolic management of critically ill patients. Metabolic changes impact nutritional substrate requirements and utilization. As the patient's clinical condition deteriorates, clinical signs and symptoms become less reliable in predicting or assessing the existing physiologic state. Objective measurements are needed to define the metabolic status during these physiologic changes. The purpose of this article is to review selected indices that have been used to identify abnormalities in nutritional substrate metabolism. Although some of these tests are readily available and inexpensive, many have not been used outside of the research setting and, therefore, their clinical utility has yet to be determined. However, their use as research tools for defining metabolism warrants their inclusion in order to assist the clinician in interpreting research studies. The biochemical markers discussed include glucose, lactate, pyruvate, triglycerides, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, urinary nitrogen, acute phase proteins, visceral proteins, 3-methylhistidine, plasma amino acids, oxygen consumption, and resting energy expenditure. Each marker is defined in terms of its biochemical significance, and the literature describing changes that occur in various stress states is cited.\r"

In addition, drugs are added with increasing frequency to PN admixtures, thus presenting even greater physicochemical challenges to this highly complex pharmaceutical product. The continuous infusion of selected drugs may provide pharmacokinetic and therapeutic advantages over conventional, intermittent, bolus methods of administration. Fluid conservation, cost savings, and a possible decrease in the risk of infection through reduced catheter manipulation and simplification of therapy provide additional incentives to consider the use of PN admixtures. The many advantages of PN admixtures make them an attractive approach to cost-effective care, with special clinical benefits achieved in the critical care setting. This article reviews our clinical experience using PN admixtures as drug vehicles for selected drugs and presents some theoretical as well as actual benefits associated with this practice.\r"

The materials infused were Gelfoam sponge or Gelfoam sponge plus Lipiodol and an anticancer agent. A control group of 15 patients with recurrent tumor received oral anticancer agents alone. The cumulative survival rate for the TACE group was 88% for the first year, 57% for 2 years, 42% for 3 years, and 27% for 5 years, whereas that of the control group was 80% for the first year, 27% for 2 years, and 18% for 3 years. Thus, the prognosis of the TACE group was significantly better (p less than or equal to .01, log-rank test) than that of the control group. The survival rate was inversely correlated with the ratio of the volume of the recurrent tumor to the volume of the whole residual liver. These results suggest that TACE is more effective than oral chemotherapy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurs after partial hepatectomy.\r"

Invasive contrast studies (voiding cystourethrography or double-balloon urethrography) or urethroscopy are frequently required for definitive diagnosis. Although transabdominal sonography has been able to visualize large diverticula, this technique has not proved useful in routine screening. In this study, we examined the use of higher frequency (5 MHz) near-focus endovaginal or transperineal sonography for the diagnosis of urethral diverticula. Five patients with radiographically proved (three with double-balloon urethrography and two with voiding cystourethrography) urethral diverticula were examined with endovaginal (two cases) or transperineal (four cases) sonography. In all five cases, sonography showed the diverticula previously demonstrated on the contrast study. The spatial relationship of the diverticula to the urethra, an important consideration at surgery, was shown more clearly by sonography than by contrast radiography. These findings suggest that sonography may be useful as a noninvasive screening technique for urethral diverticula.\r"

  ".W": "PURPOSE: To study the influence of combined hormone replacement therapy on levels of serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine healthy early postmenopausal women selected by means of a questionnaire, a medical examination, and a laboratory screening procedure to be a representative sample of postmenopausal Danish women aged 45 to 55 years old were randomized to four treatment and two placebo groups. The four groups receiving hormone replacement therapy were given 2 mg estradiol valerate equivalents (E), either sequentially combined with 75 micrograms levonorgestrel (E/LNG), 10 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (E/MPA), or 150 micrograms desogestrel (E/DG), or continuously combined with 1 mg cyproterone acetate (E/CPA). Serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins were measured before institution of hormone replacement therapy and at nine well-defined times during the following 84 days. Total response and cyclical variations were calculated. RESULTS: All active treatment regimens reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly: E/CPA, 6% (95% confidence limits 0.3% to 11.3%); E/LNG, 10.9% (4.9% to 16.6%); E/MPA, 14.4% (7.4% to 20.9%); E/DG, 10.7% (3.3% to 17.6%). The changes in serum total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were similar but smaller than those in LDL-C. None of these treatment regimens induced significant overall changes in serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1). The sequentially combined hormone treatments induced significant cyclical variations in HDL-C, with an increase during estrogen therapy and a decrease during combined therapy: E/LNG, 13.3% (7.4% to 19.4%); E/MPA, 6.9% (1.6% to 12.6%); E/DG, 10.3% (5.8% to 14.9%). No cyclical changes in HDL-C were found in the group receiving continuously combined hormone replacement therapy (E/CPA). The changes in Apo A1 parallel those in HDL-C. CONCLUSION: All the treatment regimens produced changes in levels of serum lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins that may be considered favorable in terms of cardiovascular disease.\r"

The patient presented with a subcutaneous hematoma of the abdominal wall that extended from the xiphoid process to the symphysis pubis and measured 20 cm in diameter. Results of routine coagulation studies were normal with the exception of an increased solubility of the patient's plasma clot in 5M urea consistent with a deficiency of factor XIII activity. Persistence of the deficiency following a 1:2 dilution of the patient's plasma in normal plasma indicated the presence of an inhibitor. A sample of the patient's plasma was depleted of IgG by streptococcal protein G adsorption. The IgG-depleted plasma did not inhibit factor XIII activity, indicating that the inhibitory activity was not attributable to the underlying IgM paraprotein. The patient's purified IgG, on the other hand, inhibited factor XIII activity and the inhibitory activity could be neutralized by anti-IgG antibody. The patient's IgG also inhibited factor XIII-mediated incorporation of fluorescent monodansylcadaverine into casein. Binding of the patient's IgG to factor XIII concentrate was demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the IgG that bound to the factor XIII was demonstrated to be polyclonal. Isoniazid was discontinued after the patient was admitted to the hospital. Cryoprecipitate infusion controlled bleeding and reduced the inhibitor titer by 50%. Treatment with cyclophosphamide and prednisone, followed by extracorporeal immunoadsorption over a staphylococcal protein A column, did not reduce the inhibitor titer further. Plasma exchange therapy reduced the inhibitor titer to undetectable levels but failed to restore factor XIII activity. Infusions of factor XIII concentrate reproducibly restored factor XIII activity and were not associated with an anamnestic rise in the inhibitor titer. This represents the seventh reported case of an acquired inhibitor to factor XIII associated with the ingestion of isoniazid.\r"

RESULTS: There were 7,926 incident OCTS claims identified for the years 1984-1988, which yields an industry-wide incidence rate of 1.74 claims/1,000 FTEs. The mean age (37.4 years) and female/male ratio (1.2:1) in this population differ from those reported in nonoccupational carpal tunnel studies (mean age, 51 years; female/male ratio, 3:1). The female-specific OCTS incidence rate increased significantly during the study period. The highest industry specific OCTS rates were found in the food processing, carpentry, egg production, wood products, and logging industries. CONCLUSION: Demographic differences and industry-specific rates consistent with workplace exposures suggest that OCTS is distinct from CTS occurring in nonoccupational settings. Workers' compensation data proved useful in identifying high risk industries.\r"

DESIGN: Case series of consecutive blood donors found positive for anti-HCV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients were evaluated for antibody specificity using a recombinant immunoblotting assay (RIBA) and were evaluated for biochemical evidence of liver disease. Patients showing increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels had a liver biopsy. SETTING: University hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty consecutive blood donors found to be anti-HCV positive on both an initial and repeat ELISA. Inclusion criteria were as follows: an absence of hepatitis B surface antigens and non-organ-specific autoantibodies; a daily alcohol intake of less than 50 g; no history of recent hepatotoxic drug use; and normal serum levels of alpha 1 antitrypsin, ceruloplasmin, and copper. MAIN RESULTS: Anti-HCV positivity was confirmed by RIBA in only 13 of 50 donors (26%) who had positive ELISA results. These 13 donors had an elevated ALT level and histologic evidence of chronic hepatitis, which was active in 8 patients (62%) and had already produced cirrhosis in 2 patients (15%). In contrast, the 17 donors with an intermediate RIBA pattern had only mild and often nonspecific histologic liver abnormalities. The 20 patients with a negative RIBA result had normal ALT levels. CONCLUSION: In blood donors, the anti-HCV RIBA is not only more specific than the anti-HCV ELISA, but is also useful in identifying patients who have an underlying chronic liver disease.\r"

A girl was examined because of left hemiplegia at the age of 16 months. The patient had begun exhibiting episodes of alternating hemiplegia at approximately 4 months of age. They consisted of tonic stiffening and dystonia of the right or left extremities, lasting from 30 min to several hours and followed by residual hemiparesis. They were invariably accompanied by ocular motor abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and angiography all were normal. Single proton emission computed tomography brain images during an acute episode of right hemiplegia demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere. Following improvement of the hemiplegia, the patient was re-evaluated. The uptake of the radiotracer in the left hemisphere was increased. The scan did not demonstrate significant asymmetry in cerebral perfusion.\r"

  ".W": "OBJECTIVE--To compare the effects of dual chamber pacing (DDD) and ventricular rate adaptive pacing (activity sensing) (VVIR) in patients with complete heart block. DESIGN--Double blind crossover comparison with one month in each pacing mode. PATIENTS--10 consecutive patients aged 23-74 presenting with complete anterograde atrioventricular block at rest and on exercise and with an intact atrial rate response received Synergyst I (Medtronic) pacemakers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Symptom scores, maximal exercise performance on a treadmill, and the plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. RESULTS--No significant differences were identified between pacing modes in symptom scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and mood disturbance; exercise time; and maximal oxygen consumption. One patient with intact ventriculoatrial conduction developed pacemaker syndrome during VVIR pacing. Resting plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide were raised in complete heart block and were restored to normal by DDD pacing but not by VVIR pacing. Resting plasma catecholamine concentrations were normal in complete heart block and in both pacing modes. During exercise the increase in the concentrations of all three hormones was similar in both pacing modes. CONCLUSIONS--In patients with complete anterograde and retrograde atrioventricular block, symptoms and maximal exercise performance were no better during DDD than during VVIR pacing.\r"

  ".W": "Twenty-two patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe AIDS-related complex and multilineage hematopoietic defects were treated with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in a phase I/II trial. All patients were neutropenic and anemic after withdrawal of all bone marrow-suppressive drugs. Daily, G-CSF was subcutaneously self-administered until an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) greater than 6,000/microL was achieved and maintained for 2 weeks. Subcutaneous EPO was added to the regimen and the dose increased until an increase of 15 g/L of hemoglobin was observed. Groups of patients were administered increasing doses of zidovudine to determine their tolerance. G-CSF and EPO therapy was continued with dose modification to maintain an ANC greater than 1,500/microL and hemoglobin greater than 100 g/L. The dose of zidovudine was not altered. All 22 patients responded to G-CSF with a mean 10-fold increase in neutrophils occurring in less than 2 weeks. Significant increases in CD4 and CD8 cell number, lymphocyte proliferative response, and bone marrow cellularity were seen. EPO therapy increased hemoglobin in all 20 evaluable patients within 8 weeks. Sixteen patients received 1,000 mg and four patients received 1,500 mg of zidovudine per day. The reinstitution of zidovudine resulted in a decline in reticulocytes and hemoglobin and the reappearance of transfusion requirements in eight of the 20 patients, six of whom had the study medications stopped. No patient had the study medications stopped because of neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Toxicities were mild and did not require dose modifications. Limiting dilution plasma and lymphocyte co-cultures for HIV as well as serum p24 antigen levels did not change significantly during G-CSF or combined G-CSF and EPO therapy. HIV p24 antigen decreased significantly with zidovudine therapy. Opportunistic infections occurred in 14 patients but were successfully treated with myelosuppressive antimicrobial agents, including ganciclovir, without the development of neutropenia. These results suggest that combined therapy with G-CSF and EPO may improve the neutropenia and anemia of AIDS. Combined therapy may allow the resumption of full-dose zidovudine in most patients intolerant of the hematologic effects of zidovudine without apparent alteration of HIV expression or the efficacy of zidovudine.\r"

With these purified cells as a target, we studied the effect of recombinant human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on progenitor growth, using both liquid-suspension limiting dilution assay (LDA) and regular methylcellulose culture of progenitors. We found that in LDA with IL-3, IFN-gamma directly stimulated the growth of blood progenitors in a dose-dependent manner with single-hit kinetics, whereas IFN-gamma suppressed the growth of G-CSF-supported progenitors obtained from bone marrow. The stimulatory effect was also observed in methylcellulose culture, but the addition of antibodies for G-CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor did not result in a decrease of the colony number, supporting further the possible direct effect of IFN-gamma on progenitor growth. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of IFN-gamma on hematopoietic progenitors is limited to those in an advanced stage of maturation. IFN-gamma may be one of the essential lymphokines upregulating the growth of human hematopoietic progenitor cells.\r"

  ".U": "91230332\r", 
  ".W": "We assessed the effect of interleukin-9 (IL-9) on clonogenic maturation and cell-cycle status of hematopoietic progenitors of fetal (umbilical cord blood) and adult (bone marrow) origin. As a single agent IL-9 supported, in a concentration-dependent fashion, maturation of burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) of adult and fetal origin. However, only 1/3 the number of adult BFU-E colonies developed, as did in response to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and only 1/6 the number developed as did in response to IL-3. In contrast, the effect of IL-9 on fetal BFU-E colonies was equal to that of GM-CSF and IL-3. Synergistic effects of IL-9 with low concentrations (0.1 ng/mL) of GM-CSF and IL-3 were seen on adult BFU-E colony formation, but no effect was apparent at higher concentrations (1.0 ng/mL). In contrast, using fetal cells, synergistic effects of IL-9 with low and high concentrations of GM-CSF and IL-3 were apparent. Addition of IL-9 to plates containing fetal cells plus GM-CSF and IL-3 not only resulted in more BFU-E colonies, but also in more multicentered (greater than or equal to 10 individual centers) colonies, and more cells per colony. IL-9 had a wider spectrum of action on progenitors of fetal origin than on progenitors of adult origin, supporting the generation of fetal multipotent colony-forming unit (CFU)-Mix and CFU-GM colonies. Incubation with IL-9 did not accelerate cycling of adult or fetal BFU-E, CFU-Mix, or CFU-GM to the extent observed after incubation with IL-6. Thus, IL-9 primarily supported maturation of erythroid progenitors of adult origin, and its addition to plates containing GM-CSF and IL-3 (1.0 ng/mL) did not result in maturation of additional clones. In contrast, IL-9 had a wider spectrum of action on fetal progenitors and, when combined with IL-3 and GM-CSF, resulted in clonogenic maturation of progenitors that did not undergo maturation after stimulation with IL-3 and GM-CSF.\r"

These observations provide a possible basis for the observation that, when LIF is injected in vivo, elevations are observed in megakaryocyte numbers and platelet levels.\r"

Positively selected CD8+CD57+ lymphocytes act as potent inhibitors of allospecific cytolytic T lymphocyte and lymphokine activated killer cell cytolytic activities. These suppressor cells are mature T cells expressing the CD2, 5, 7, CD3-TcR alpha beta complex, and lack natural killer cell markers as well as cytolytic function. Their inhibitory activity on both cytolytic processes and T-cell proliferation is mediated by a non-antigen-specific soluble factor released by CD8+CD57+ cells in culture supernatants. Preliminary characterization suggests that the CD8+CD57+ cells' inhibitory activity is mediated by a low molecular weight, glycosylated factor as indicated by its less than 1S coefficient of sedimentation and its binding to concanavalin A lectin.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the expression of cell surface antigens associated with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias on bone marrow-derived blast cells from 339 patients with newly diagnosed de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) enrolled on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) chemotherapy protocols. Surprisingly, of 211 cases studied for the expression of CD2 (T-cell marker, sheep erythrocyte binding receptor for T lymphocytes) 45 were positive (21%). In addition, of 298 patients studied for CD19 (B-lymphocyte marker), 41 were positive (14%). Overall, of 170 patients studied for both CD2 and CD19, 56 (33%) were positive. Interestingly, central review of the French-American-British (FAB) morphology of the CD2- and CD19-positive cases showed that FAB M3 was twice as frequent, and M4E eight times as frequent compared with the CD2- and CD19-negative cases. Of 22 lymphocyte antigen-positive cases in which cells were available for studies of Ig or T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, 20 were germline, one had a rearranged Ig heavy chain gene, and one had rearranged TCR beta and Ig heavy chain genes. The presence of messenger RNA for CD2 was demonstrated in four CD2 surface antigen-positive cases, thus validating the cell surface data. Lymphocyte antigen-positive cases had karyotypes commonly seen in AML; 71% of cases with an abnormal clone had t(8;21)(q22;q22), inversion 16(p13q22), t(15;17)(q22;q12), or t(9;11)(p22;q23). The patients with lymphocyte markers had a significantly higher incidence of these karyotypic abnormalities compared with patients with lymphocyte antigen-negative AML (34% v 15%, P less than .02). When the outcome to therapy of the lymphocyte antigen-positive cases was compared with that for the CD2, CD19-negative cases, we found that the CD2, CD19-positive cases actually had higher complete remission rates (75% v 59%, P = .04), and significantly longer time to failure (P = .02; 32.4% +/- 6.0% v 18.0% +/- 4.1% at 2 years) and overall survival (P = .02; 43.5% +/- 6.3% v 26.0% +/- 4.5% at 2 years). CD2 antigen-positive cases also had a significantly superior survival (P = .02; 43.8% +/- 7.9% v 29.8% +/- 3.8% at 2 years). There were no significant differences (P less than or equal to .05) between the two groups in age, leukocyte count at diagnosis, incidence of extramedullary disease, or FAB classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

There were 224 patients enrolled from three private pediatric practices. Patients were alternately assigned to have their temperature taken with either a tympanic thermometer or with a rectal or oral thermometer depending on the patient's age. For each child enrolled in the study a nurse was asked to time the temperature taking process. Items included in the cost analysis: a) thermometer costs; b) disposable supply costs; c) personnel costs; d) equipment service costs. The mean duration of temperature taking was 35.2 seconds using tympanic thermometers, 73.4 seconds using electronic predictive thermometers, and 247.2 seconds using glass thermometers. In practices taking an average of 10 temperatures per day, tympanic thermometry saved $2,316/year when compared to glass thermometers and $442/year when compared to electronic predictive thermometers. The data presented in this study show that when nursing time is taken into account, tympanic thermometry is less expensive to perform than traditional methods of thermometry despite the initial higher cost of the thermometer.\r"

In this study we found that urinary recovery during steady-state encainide in three poor metabolizers was high (49% to 80%), consisted mainly of unchanged encainide, was nonstereoselective (+/- ratio, 0.985 to 1.049), and was unchanged by quinidine, a potent inhibitor of P450IID6. In contrast, in seven extensive metabolizers the +/- urinary ratios were 1.20 +/- 0.06 for encainide and 0.81 +/- 0.06 (both p less than 0.01) for the cytochrome P450IID6 products O-desmethylencainide plus 3-methoxy-O-desmethylencainide; with quinidine the total percentage recovery rose from 4% +/- 4% to 37% +/- 9% because of increased recovery of unchanged encainide and became non-stereoselective (+/- ratio, 0.84 +/- 0.08 [encainide alone] versus 0.97 +/- 0.05 [encainide plus quinidine]). In vitro, encainide enantiomers depressed the maximum rate of metabolism with similar frequency and concentration dependence. We conclude that (-)-encainide undergoes preferential metabolism by cytochrome P450IID6; however, this genetically determined stereoselective disposition is unlikely to play a major role in mediating the clinical actions of encainide.\r"

  ".W": "Kinetic modeling has been applied to the time course of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal intensities of 5-fluorouracil and the sum of its catabolites, alpha-fluoro-beta-ureido propanoic acid and alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine, as monitored in liver tumors of seven patients with cancer after brief intraarterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. Because these data represent only relative tissue concentrations, only ratios of clearance and volume parameters can be estimated (e.g., clearance/central volume of distribution or central volume of distribution/steady-state volume of distribution). On the other hand, parameters that do not refer to volumes, such as half-lives or maximal velocity of metabolic conversion of a nonlinear model, can be estimated in absolute terms. A nonlinear three-compartment model gave satisfactory fits with all of the individual data sets. Kinetics of 5-fluorouracil and catabolites were similar in five patients with metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas but differed from those of two patients with cholangiocarcinoma and metastases of an anaplastic carcinoma of unknown origin, respectively.\r"

Didanosine was administered twice a day for 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion of 60 minutes duration at doses ranging from 0.4 to 16.5 mg/kg, followed by 4 weeks of oral treatment at twice the intravenous dose. Serial blood and urine samples were obtained on the first and final day of intravenous administration and after the first oral dose, as well as at steady state. Didanosine demonstrated linear pharmacokinetic behavior over the dose ranges of 0.4 to 16.5 mg/kg intravenously and 0.8 to 10.2 mg/kg orally. There was no indication of significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters with repeated administration. The apparent elimination half-life after oral administration was approximately 1.4 hour. Renal clearance values exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion of didanosine occurs. Bioavailability of didanosine when administered as a solution with an antacid was approximately 43% for doses from 0.8 to 10.2 mg/kg in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS-related complex. Bioavailability of didanosine from the citrate-phosphate-buffered solution, the formulation currently used in phase II and expanded access studies, was comparable to the formulation used in the phase I trials.\r"

The overall prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus was 0.28% among 1,419 healthy subjects, 0.8% among 500 unselected paid blood donors and 0.4% among 793 pregnant women. The three offspring of the mothers positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus were all found to be positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus at birth but all became negative by the age of 6 mo. Among healthy subjects, none of 1,000 school children and young adolescents had antibody to hepatitis C virus. Among patients in selected \"high-risk\" groups, antibody to hepatitis C virus was detected in 100% of 9 hemophiliac patients who were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus, in 53% of 115 intravenous drug abusers, in 34.4% of 96 hemodialysis patient and in 15.8% of 19 homosexual men who were positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus. Only 7.1% of 196 prostitutes, 5.9% of 34 spouses of patients positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus and 0.5% of 201 brothelgoers had antibody to hepatitis C virus. These findings suggest that hepatitis C virus is transmitted mainly by the parenteral route in Taiwan. Transmission from mother to infant is not an important mode of spread of hepatitis C virus.\r"

  ".W": "To verify the existence of chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol, the clinicopathological features of chronic hepatitis in heavy drinkers were studied using various viral markers. Histological features of chronic active hepatitis were seen in 27 heavy drinkers. These patients were divided into four groups. The AL group (seven cases) consisted of alcoholics who were negative for both hepatitis C antibody and HBsAg; the HB group (four cases) was positive for HBsAg; the HC1 group (seven cases) was positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus-RNA genome; and the HC2 group (nine cases) was positive both for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus-RNA genome. Serum AST and ALT activity declined during 4 wk of abstinence in most patients in the AL group and in the HC1 group. The response of serum AST and ALT to abstinence was poor in most patients in the HB group and the HC2 group. Serum desialo-transferrin and alcohol liver membrane antibodies were detected more frequently in the sera of patients in the AL group and HC1 group. A trend toward increased frequency of centrilobular ballooning existed in the AL group, but this did not reach statistical significance. These results suggest that chronic active hepatitis in patients in the AL group, in whom markers of HBV and hepatitis C virus were absent, may be caused by alcohol. Patients in the HC1 group who had hepatitis C antibody but not hepatitis C virus-RNA may represent cases where both alcohol and hepatitis C virus are involved.\r"

The animals were divided into three distinct groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 (controls) received 0.5 ml saline solution intravenously 30 min after the induction of ischemia. Groups 2 and 3 were injected with FK 506 (0.3 mg/kg) intravenously 30 min after and 24 min before the induction of hepatic ischemia, respectively. The hepatic content of ATP and serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase were determined on each animal. In addition, the histological appearance and mitotic activity of the remnant liver was determined at regular 24-hr intervals after hepatic ischemia. All 10 control animals died within 72 hr. Treatment with FK 506 resulted in improved survival in groups 2 and 3 (30% and 80%, respectively). The improved survival seen in the FK 506-treated animals was reflected by a restoration of hepatic ATP content, a reduction in the serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase, an amelioration of hepatic necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration and an increase in the mitotic activity of the liver. These results suggest that FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia/reperfusion and has a potent stimulatory effect on liver cell regeneration that may make it valuable as a hepatoprotective agent when administered to organ donors before graft harvesting.\r"

  ".W": "Schistosomiasis is the main cause of hepatic fibrosis worldwide, yet its pathogenesis remains unknown. We previously reported that conditioned medium from cultures of hepatic egg granulomas (isolated from mice acutely infected with Schistosoma mansoni) can stimulate fibroblast proliferation and matrix production in vitro. We have proposed that initiation of hepatic fibrosis in this infection might be under the control of granuloma-derived cytokines. We now report that conditioned medium from cultures of schistosomal egg granulomas isolated from liver of chronically infected mice has reduced fibrogenic activity compared with medium from cultures of granulomas obtained from more acutely infected mice. In related studies, we adoptively transferred splenocytes from infected mice and examined the fibrogenic activity in culture supernatants of hepatic egg granulomas isolated from the recipients. Those prepared from recipients of splenocytes from chronically infected mice contained substantially less fibrogenic activity than did those from recipients of splenocytes of acutely infected mice. These findings suggest that the fibrogenic influence of schistosomal egg granuloma products decreases during the course of chronic murine S. mansoni infection. Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest that immunoregulatory cells may be responsible for the down-regulation of this influence. Previous observations indicating that in murine schistosomiasis hepatic collagen and hyaluronate synthesis and deposition are elevated in acute but not chronic infection might be explained on the basis of our observations.\r"

Half of each group then received a high-sodium diet (3.1%) for 24 hours before sacrifice. Mean plasma ANF concentrations were greater in the older adult rats, 506 +/- 287 pg/ml, than in young or mature rats, 262 +/- 182 and 150 +/- 40 pg/ml, respectively (p less than .001). Age-related increases in plasma ANF concentration and left atrial ANF content (p less than .001) were present in both low- and high-sodium fed rats. Significant differences in plasma and atrial ANF levels between low- and high-sodium fed rats were noted only in older adult rats, where an inverse correlation (r = -.425, p less than .05) was observed between plasma and left atrial ANF levels. These observations demonstrate that plasma and atrial ANF levels increase with age in the rat. With aging, increased ANF effects may modulate other systems regulating cardiovascular homeostasis.\r"

The data presented show that (a) glycation and accumulation of the chromophore(s) are comparable in collagen samples from different species of comparable age; (b) glycation and pigmented accumulation increase markedly during the first 5-10 years of age; (c) the extent of glycation is different in different tissues (in particular, glycation of aortal collagen is about twice that of skin collagen); and (d) collagen pigmentation as followed by fluorescence is comparable in aortal and skin collagen (except below 10 years); pigmentation measured by absorbance at 350 nm is, on the contrary, lower in aortal than in skin collagen. Based on the assumption of constant blood glucose level during the life span, it appears feasible to conclude that the degree of nonenzymatic collagen glycation reflects the time period for which the protein was exposed to the action of sugars. This period, because of increased cross-linking, is likely to be extended in older animals. Other factors, such as differences in collagen turnover between different tissues and the intensity of the removal process of the glycated products, should be taken into consideration as well.\r"

This reduction was due to a delay in the full expression of activity of these enzymes during epithelial cell transit from the crypt onto the intestinal villus. We now show in the ad libitum fed Fischer 344 rat that jejunal sucrase, maltase, and alkaline phosphatase specific activities do not fall gradually throughout the life span, but are reduced during senescence. Caloric restriction to 60% of ad libitum intake (DR) abolishes or delays this fall in enzyme activity. Jejunal mucosal immunoprecipitable sucrase-isomaltase (S-I) content also falls with age, but sucrase specific activity per molecule of S-I is less in the older ad libitum fed (approximately 45) than in the DR rats (approximately 60). Jejunal lactase activity falls gradually throughout the life span of ad libitum and DR rats, but lactase activity consistently was higher in DR animals. These observations indicate that DR alters the age-related changes in the activity of several enzymes in the rapidly replicating gut mucosa.\r"

  ".W": "To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Systolic and diastolic Doppler frequencies of the middle cerebral artery were plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure; the reactivity index (I x R) was defined as relative frequency change during a PCO2 increase of 5 mmHg. In the normal subjects, I x R was 20.0 +/- 6.3 for systolic velocities, and 26.0 +/- 8.2 for diastolic values. Migraineurs during their headache-free interval had significantly higher I x R values on the affected side (mean: 41.6 systolic, 61.2 diastolic), compared with either controls (P less than 0.01) or the contralateral side (mean: 28.3 systolic, 30.8 diastolic; P less than 0.01). During the headache attack, CO2 reactivity was significantly lower than normal only for systolic velocities (mean: 8.3; P less than 0.05). Increased CO2 reactivity is thought to be one phenomenon of migraine. Transcranial Doppler CO2 testing of cerebrovascular reactivity is a reliable method that may be of interest for the diagnostic evaluation and management of migraine patients.\r"

Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease. A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation. Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses. However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently. The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses. In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process. The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora.\r"

  ".W": "Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an adhesive, multimeric glycoprotein present in plasma, platelets, and subendothelium, which has two main functions: (1) it serves as a carrier for factor VIII and (2) it plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion to subendothelium, acting as a \"bridge\" between platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ib and GP IIb/IIIa and subendothelial components such as collagen and heparin. vWF is involved at high shear rates in the initial contact of platelets with the subendothelium, in their subsequent spreading, and in thrombus formation. The three pools of vWF (plasma, platelets, and subendothelium) are necessary for optimal adhesion. Specific fragments of vWF involved in binding to platelets, collagen, heparin, and factor VIII have been mapped by using a series of proteases and well-characterized monoclonal antibodies to distinct epitopes of vWF. Several groups, including ours, have identified at least eight functional domains on the 270-kd subunit that consists of 2,050 amino acids. The importance of the binding domains to GP Ib and to collagen is illustrated by the role of vWF fragment SpIII (amino acids 1 through 1,365) in promoting platelet adhesion to collagen. The role of the vWF-GP Ib axis and of the vWF-GP IIb/IIIa axis in platelet-vessel wall interactions has been demonstrated through the study of patients, monoclonal antibodies, recombinant fragments, and synthetic peptides. We have recently expressed fragments of vWF complementary DNA in Escherichia coli. One of these recombinant fragments, which spans amino acids 449 through 730, binds to platelets in the presence of ristocetin, to collagen, and to heparin and has the property of inhibiting ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination. The second fragment, which spans amino acids 914 through 1,364, binds to collagen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".U": "91232269\r", 
  ".W": "Factor VIII (FVIII) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) are plasma glycoproteins that circulate as a tightly associated complex. Because they tend to copurify during procedures designed to isolate the biologic activities associated with them, their identity as distinct entities became unequivocally established only during the past 10 years. Improved procedures for the isolation of FVIII, the deduction of the amino acid sequences of FVIII and vWF by using molecular cloning techniques and by direct sequencing, and the use of a variety of biophysical and immunochemical techniques have enhanced the understanding of the FVIII-vWF association. Each subunit of multimeric vWF potentially can bind a single heterodimeric FVIII molecule, although in vivo most of these binding sites are empty. The binding of FVIII to vWF is primarily, if not exclusively, mediated by the light chain of FVIII to the amino-terminal region of the vWF subunit. Cleavage of a fragment from the amino-terminal region of the FVIII light chain by thrombin results in rapid dissociation of the FVIII-vWF complex, a process that apparently is necessary for development of procoagulant activity. Whether this cleavage is needed for the activation of FVIII in the absence of vWF is controversial. The extracellular association of FVIII with vWF may be necessary for efficient secretion of FVIII from its cell of origin. The thermodynamics, kinetics, and nature of the molecular contacts involved in the interaction have not been studied. The association of FVIII with vWF prolongs the lifetime of FVIII in plasma. Whether the FVIII-vWF interaction has other functional roles, such as restricting the location of procoagulant activity, remains unknown.\r"

We have found the MERRF mutation in members of 6 British kindreds; 2 of these had unusual phenotypes but all index patients had myoclonus. The MELAS mutation was detected in 17 patients from 16 families, who had a wide range of clinical features that particularly affected the central nervous system; stroke-like episodes were observed in 10.3 patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations did not have ragged red fibres on muscle biopsy, generally considered to be the morphological hallmark of mitochondrial diseases. In all 6 patients with the MERRF mutation, and 10 of 11 with the MELAS mutation, the genetic defect was easily detected in blood cells as well as muscle (blood samples were not available in 6 patients with MELAS mutations in muscle). Molecular genetic analysis of blood samples represents an inexpensive and reliable screening test for mitochondrial encephalopathies, and use of such techniques could influence diagnosis and genetic counselling in patients with seizure disorders and young-onset stroke.\r"

Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) can be used as an adjunct to skull base surgery and external beam radiation to enhance local control in areas with close margins or remaining microscopic disease. During the period from May 1982 to May 1988, 25 patients underwent IORT of the skull base following resection and prior to closure to treat microscopic disease in 9 patients, sterilize close margins in 14 patients, and attempt to eliminate remaining gross disease in 2 patients. The types of tumors treated were 13 squamous cell carcinomas, 4 adenoid cystic carcinomas, 3 high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 3 sarcomas, 1 malignant mixed tumor, and an oncocytic adenocarcinoma. The majority of the tumors either originated in the sinuses or were skull base extensions of oral cavity or oropharyngeal cancers. In 22 patients with 1-year follow-up, IORT prevented local recurrence in 14 (64%) patients. This may represent improved control of local disease in patients who historically have a very dismal prognosis. The indications, techniques, and complications of this exciting therapeutic modality are also reviewed.\r"

In cardiac pacemaker cells, adrenaline and acetylcholine regulate the hyperpolarization-activated current (if), but in opposite ways; this current is involved in the generation and modulation of pacemaker activity. These actions are mediated by cAMP and underlie control of spontaneous rate by neurotransmitters. Whether the cAMP modulation of if is mediated by channel phosphorylation is, however, still unknown. Here we investigate the action of cAMP on if in excised patches of cardiac pacemaker cells and find that cAMP activates if by a mechanism independent of phosphorylation, involving a direct interaction with the channels at their cytoplasmic side. Cyclic AMP activates if by shifting its activation curve to more positive voltages, in agreement with whole-cell results. This is the first evidence of an ion channel whose gating is dually regulated by voltage and direct cAMP binding.\r"

The stage of thymocyte development at which the interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) leads to deletion, however, has not been determined directly. Indirect evidence suggests that intrathymic APCs induce deletion of CD4+8+ thymocytes (which die by apoptosis) but deletion at less and more mature developmental stages has also been implied. It is also not clear if clonal elimination of thymocytes can be triggered by peripheral antigens carried on extrathymic APCs migrating through the thymus. Here we show antigen-specific induction of apoptosis in CD4+8+ thymocytes cultured in suspension, by thymic as well as splenic APCs. Thus the recognition of antigen by CD4+8+ thymocytes may lead to deletion, suggesting that this is the central mechanism of tolerance induction, which is not limited by the antigen-presenting ability of the thymic stroma.\r"

Although alveolar macrophages can degrade P. carinii, macrophage receptors involved in P. carinii recognition have not been clearly defined. Characterization of a predominant surface glycoprotein of the high mannose type led us to investigate the role of the macrophage mannose receptor in this process. We report here that binding and uptake of cultured rat P. carinii by human and rat alveolar macrophages is reduced by 90% in the presence of competitive inhibitors of mannose receptor activity and by adherence of alveolar macrophages to mannan-coated surfaces. Further, only those COS cells transfected with the human macrophage mannose receptor complementary DNA that express surface mannose receptors bind and ingest P. carinii. These studies establish that the macrophage mannose receptor is sufficient for uptake of P. carinii and emphasize the role of the alveolar macrophage in first-line host defence against P. carinii.\r"

Ypt1 and Sec4 are homologous Raslike GTP-binding proteins that have been proposed to regulate the specificity of vesicular traffic at different stages of the secretory pathway by cycling on and off membranes. Here we show that BET2, initially identified as a gene required for transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi apparatus in yeast, encodes a factor that is needed for the membrane attachment of Ypt1 and Sec4. DNA sequence analysis has revealed that Bet2 is homologous to Dpr1 (Ram1), an essential component of a protein prenyltransferase that modifies Ras, enabling it to attach to membranes. We propose that Bet2 modifies Ypt1 and Sec4 in an analogous manner.\r"

  ".W": "The signal recognition particle (SRP) directs signal sequence specific targeting of ribosomes to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Displacement of the SRP from the signal sequence of a nascent polypeptide is a guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent reaction mediated by the membrane-bound SRP receptor. A nonhydrolyzable GTP analog can replace GTP in the signal sequence displacement reaction, but the SRP then fails to dissociate from the membrane. Complexes of the SRP with its receptor containing the nonhydrolyzable analog are incompetent for subsequent rounds of protein translocation. Thus, vectorial targeting of ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum is controlled by a GTP hydrolysis cycle that regulates the affinity between the SRP, signal sequences, and the SRP receptor.\r"

  ".U": "91233997\r", 
  ".W": "Nosocomial pneumonia is frequent and is associated with high mortality in intubated mechanically ventilated patients. To determine whether there is a significant relationship between subclinical aspiration from nasogastric feeding and development of nosocomial pneumonia, we studied 24 ventilated patients who received nasogastric feeding. Endotracheal aspirates were tested twice daily for the presence of glucose using a glucose oxidase reagent strip. Subclinical aspiration was defined by the presence of glucose in nonbloody endotracheal aspirates. Nosocomial pneumonia was defined by the presence of all of the following conditions: (1) new or worsening infiltrate on chest roentgenogram consistent with pneumonia, (2) temperature greater than 38 degrees C and/or white blood cell count greater than 10,000/mm3 with 10% or more band forms, (3) culture of a new organism in the sputum, and (4) purulent tracheobronchial secretions. Twelve patients had no positive glucose tests of their endotracheal aspirates during their intensive care unit stay, one of whom developed nosocomial pneumonia. Twelve patients had endotracheal aspirates that were positive for glucose on 1 to 5 occasions. Of these patients, seven had bloody glucose-positive aspirates, four of whom developed clinical pneumonia. The remaining five patients had nonbloody glucose-positive endotracheal aspirates and all developed nosocomial pneumonia. There was a significantly greater incidence of pneumonia among patients who had nonbloody glucose-positive aspirates than among patients without glucose-positive aspirates (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). We conclude that subclinical aspiration of nasogastric feeding, as detected by nonbloody glucose-positive endotracheal aspiration, is associated with the development of nosocomial pneumonia.\r"

  ".W": "Thirty prepubertal patients with thalassaemia major (15 boys and 15 girls) aged from 9.3 to 17.2 years (mean 12.9) who had successfully undergone allogenic bone marrow transplantation were studied. Before the transplant all patients were given short courses of high doses of busulphan (total dose 14 mg/kg) followed by cyclophosphamide (total dose 200 mg/kg). Pituitary gonadal function was assessed between 0.7 and 5.1 years (mean 2.3) after bone marrow transplantation. Increased gonadotrophin concentrations indicating gonadal damage were found in 80% of the girls, probably as a result of the chemotherapy. In all the prepubertal boys the basal follicle stimulating hormone and luteinising hormone concentrations were normal. Most of the boys had reduced gonadotrophin and testosterone responses after gonadotrophin releasing hormone and human chorionic gonadotrophin tests. This could have been the result of iron overload but the effect of cytotoxic agents cannot be excluded. These findings emphasise the need for vigilant long term follow up of thalassaemic patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for bone marrow transplantation so that those requiring hormone replacement can be identified and treated.\r"

HIV infection of these cell lines transactivates the LTR promoter inducing beta-galactosidase production. Infected cells and virus foci can be stained dark blue by the addition of the chromogenic substrate X-Gal. Alternatively, a readily automatable quantitative enzyme assay can be performed on the infected cultures. Because of its simplicity the bioassay may be useful for routine quantification of HIV-infected cultures, plaque purification, virus neutralization studies and for the screening of antiviral agents.\r"

When the data were analyzed in relation to date of diagnosis, the relative hazard was depressed (0.90, P less than 0.001) for the period 6 months prior to diagnosis, but was close to 1.0 for the period 6-36 months prior to diagnosis. These findings suggest a complex relationship between CD8+ cell counts and progression to AIDS, with the possibility that various subsets of the CD8+ compartment play different roles.\r"

Eighteen patients received streptokinase and ten patients received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA). Indications included arterial thromboemboli and graft failures. Mean ischaemic times were similar in both groups. Treatment time to achieve lysis was significantly less with rTPA (P less than 0.01). Subsequent vascular procedures, including angioplasty or reconstruction, were undertaken in 36 per cent of patients. Arterial puncture site bleeding occurred in eight (29 per cent) patients. Three (11 per cent) patients suffered rethrombosis after initial successful lysis. All rethromboses were successfully lysed with rTPA. There were two major amputations. Five (18 per cent) patients died, all lytic failures in the streptokinase treatment group. There were no cerebral haemorrhagic events and no patient died as a result of thrombolytic therapy. Good clinical outcome was obtained in nine of 18 patients treated with streptokinase and in nine of ten patients treated with rTPA. Intra-arterial thrombolysis provides effective therapy with high rates of limb salvage and a low mortality rate. This study suggests that rTPA may be a more effective agent, causing less morbidity, than streptokinase.\r"

  ".W": "A total of 1290 patients were enrolled in a randomized multicentre double blind study in order to investigate the use of two doses of a new low molecular weight heparin, Logiparin, in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in general surgery. Patients who were included had no contraindication to heparin therapy and had at least one of the recognized risk factors for DVT. Patients were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin (UH) 5000 units b.d., Logiparin 2500 units daily or Logiparin 3500 units daily. Each treatment was given subcutaneously 2 h before surgery and continued for 7-10 days. Daily 125I-labelled fibrinogen uptake tests (FUTs) were performed from day 2 to day 7 to detect DVT, and phleboangiography was used to confirm the diagnosis. The wound was examined on a daily basis to check for haematoma formation, and all patients were followed up for 1 month after operation. All three treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, weight, diagnosis and type of operation performed. The three major inclusion criteria in the trial were malignancy, age over 60 years and a history of varicose veins. Positive FUTs (UH = 4.2 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 7.9 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 3.7 per cent) and positive angiograms (UH = 3.0 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 5.6 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 2.3 per cent) were significantly more common in the Logiparin 2500 units daily group than in the UH and Logiparin 3500 units daily groups. The rates of major complications (severe haemorrhage, death, pulmonary embolism, reintervention) were similar in the three groups.\r"

  ".U": "91235024\r", 
  ".W": "Recent animal data suggest that the gut plays a far more important metabolic role than previously thought. During critical illness, disruption in bowel barrier function may result in a chronic hypermetabolic state and contribute to multiorgan failure. Animal studies have demonstrated that enterocytes of the gastrointestinal tract use glutamine as a respiratory fuel and during critical illness the consumption of glutamine by the gut significantly increases. The selective uptake of glutamine by the gut, to date, has not been confirmed in humans. Seven patients who sustained multisystem trauma necessitating laparotomy underwent portal venous catheterization. This was done by carefully reopening the obliterated umbilical vein and facilitating access to the left branch of the portal vein using a standard central venous catheter. Portal venous and systemic blood samples were recorded for 5 days after operation. Amino acid levels in both circulations were recorded at 48 h and 5 days. Using Student's t test for related samples, the differences between individual amino acids in portal and systemic circulations were compared. At 48 h, mean(s.d.) portal venous glutamine was 85(5) per cent of the systemic levels (253(80) compared with 296(90) mumol/ml, P less than 0.002). At 5 days, portal glutamine was 87(3) per cent of the systemic levels (255(69) compared with 292(83) mumol/ml, P less than 0.003). Levels of citrulline, a breakdown product of glutamine metabolism, were elevated in the portal venous circulation at 48 h (20(4) compared with 16(3) mumol/ml, P less than 0.005) and at 5 days (21(5) compared with 14(3) mumol/ml, P less than 0.002). No significant differences between any of the other amino acids analysed were identified. This study confirms, for the first time in humans, that selective uptake of glutamine occurs in the gut. In stressed states, glutamine deficiency is associated with gut mucosal atrophy. This has significant implications as glutamine is not provided in most commercially available parenteral and enteral nutrition formulations.\r"

Protein synthesis, an index of tumour growth, was then measured by the incorporation of [13C]leucine into tumour protein immediately before surgery. The mean (s.e.m.) rate of tumour protein synthesis in patients receiving nutrition (42.7(3.5) per cent per day) was 89 per cent higher than the rate in the fasted group (22.6(1.9) per cent per day) (P = 0.002). As tumours consist of a variety of different cell types, in vitro rates of protein synthesis were measured in malignant cells isolated from colorectal tumours and cultured with autologous serum obtained from the patient in either the fasted or the fed state. There was a mean increase of 81 per cent in protein synthesis when fed rather than fasted serum was used (P less than 0.02), indicating that the malignant cells themselves respond to nutrient supply. This increase in tumour protein synthesis provides the first evidence in vivo that the exogenous supply of nutrients can modulate the rate of growth of a human tumour.\r"

After a median follow-up interval of 8 months fewer than 1 per cent of lasered metastases have recurred locally. Sixteen patients have developed cutaneous metastases at other sites requiring further treatment. Approximately 2000 lesions have been treated on 64 occasions. Patients reported little or no pain after the operation and required only simple dry dressings. Wounds were completely healed in 2-6 weeks with good cosmetic results.

However, in the spontaneously hypertensive rats, the maximum vasodilator response to atrial natriuretic factor, but not to sodium nitroprusside, was increased. 4. The perfused kidney from the spontaneously hypertensive rat also showed an increase in the maximum but not in the slope or ED50 of the concentration-response curve for vasoconstriction induced by the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. 5. The involvement of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in mediating the renal vasodilator response to A23187 and acetylcholine was confirmed in experiments performed in perfused kidneys obtained from normotensive Wistar rats. 6. It is concluded that the sensitivity of the kidney to endothelium-derived-relaxing-factor-mediated vasodilatation is not modified in the spontaneously hypertensive rat. This does not, however, exclude a role for the synthesis of endothelium-derived relaxing factor in the maintenance of blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.\r"

  ".W": "1. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have increased diuresis during sleep, which decreases with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment. These changes have been attributed to an increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide in obstructive sleep apnoea, and its decrease with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 2. In order to clarify the change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals from nine patients with obstructive sleep apnoea during two nights when the patients were either untreated or treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Polysomnographic monitoring, including transcutaneous oximetry, and measurement of oesophageal pressure were performed simultaneously. Plasma arginine vasopressin was also measured. 3. The plasma level of arginine vasopressin did not change. The level of atrial natriuretic peptide was high and exhibited secretion bursts in six out of the nine patients; it drastically decreased with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 4. Across the patients, the mean plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide was correlated with the degree of hypoxaemia and the degree of oesophageal pressure swings during the sleep apnoeas. 5. Within the patients, cross-correlation studies suggested that the atrial natriuretic peptide secretory bursts were related either to the oesophageal pressure swings or to the apnoea-related hypoxaemia. 6. We conclude that release of atrial natriuretic peptide decreases with continuous positive airway pressure treatment in those patients with obstructive sleep apnoea who have increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide before treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The effect of sodium intake on the natriuresis and hormonal changes induced by head-out water immersion was studied in seven normal subjects during head-out water immersion and on a control day while successively on 20 mmol of sodium/day and 100 mmol of sodium/day diets. The effects of head-out water immersion were compared with those seen on the control day for both diets. 2. The natriuresis on the 100 mmol of sodium/day diet was significantly greater than on the 20 mmol of sodium/day diet (natriuretic peak: 10.3 +/- 2.2 versus 3.9 +/- 1 mmol of sodium/h; P less than 0.01). The total sodium excretion during the 3 h of head-out water immersion was 26.2 +/- 2.0 mmol on the 100 mmol of sodium/day diet and 9.9 +/- 0.9 mmol on the 20 mmol of sodium/day diet (P less than 0.01). In contrast, the increase in the plasma atrial natriuretic factor level was similar on both diets (peak plasma atrial natriuretic factor level 23.1 +/- 1.9 versus 26.2 +/- 1 pg/ml; not significant). As expected, the baseline serum aldosterone level was higher on the 20 mmol of sodium/day diet and, despite a significant suppression, remained significantly higher at the end of the third hour of head-out water immersion (peak serum aldosterone level: 495 +/- 130 versus 197 +/- 26 pmol/l, P less than 0.06). Furthermore, there was an inverse relationship between the serum aldosterone level and the urinary sodium excretion at the time of peak natriuresis (r = -0.59, P less than 0.01). 3. We conclude that the effect of sodium intake on the natriuresis induced by head-out water immersion is more dependent upon anti-natriuretic agents, such as aldosterone, than on natriuretic factors, such as atrial natriuretic factor.\r"

The effects of acute hypoglycaemia on haemostasis, fibrinolysis, blood viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation were examined after acute insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in six normal male subjects and in six male patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes. In the control subjects hypoglycaemia caused a significant increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor, with no change in the concentrations of fibrinogen and cross-linked fibrin degradation products. Fibrinolysis was enhanced, as indicated by significant increases in tissue plasminogen activator concentration and the fibrin plate lysis area, with a fall in plasminogen-activator inhibitor activity, suggesting complex formation. Whole-blood and plasma viscosity increased significantly after hypoglycaemia, but there was no significant change in erythrocyte aggregation tendency. 2. In diabetic patients the increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor was significantly greater than in the control group (analysis of variance, P less than 0.02). The basal concentration of tissue plasminogen activator was reduced at 3.7 +/- 0.7 mg/l (mean +/- SEM) in the diabetic group compared with 8.5 +/- 1.3 mg/l in the control group (Student's t-test, P less than 0.01), but thereafter the increase in response to hypoglycaemia was similar. The changes in the other variables were not significantly different from the changes in the control group. 3. During acute hypoglycaemia in poorly controlled diabetic patients there is promotion of haemostasis with a greater increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor, which, in association with the increase in viscosity, might reduce perfusion in diabetic microangiopathy, leading to aggravation of the microvascular complications of diabetes.\r"

After reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, three major bands having molecular weights of 58,000, 34,500, and 31,500 were evident. In addition, a band having a molecular weight of 21,000 was detected. hHGF activity was destroyed by its reduction. The hHGF purified from patients demonstrated a dose response in terms of an increase in DNA synthesis using cultured hepatocytes. The hHGF concentration in the plasma of the patients with grade III-IV hepatic coma was calculated to be in the range of 1.8-3.0 nM. Finally the heavy chain of hHGF was not recognized by an anti-human albumin antibody, indicating that hHGF is not biliprotein, an albumin-bilirubin complex, that has been reported to be a putative liver growth factor.\r"

Seventeen patients presented with FHF secondary to hepatitis A (N = 3), hepatitis B (N = 6) and non-A, non-B (NANB) hepatitis (N = 8). Fourteen of the 17 patients had stage III or IV hepatic encephalopathy (HE). At presentation, the mean AST was 1844 +/- 1246 units/liter, bilirubin 232 +/- 135 mumol/liter, PT 34 +/- 18 and PTT 73 +/- 26 sec, and coagulation factors V and VII were 8 +/- 4 and 9 +/- 51%, respectively. Twelve of 17 patients responded to PGE1 rapidly, with a decrease in AST from 1540 +/- 833 to 188 +/- 324 units/liter, a decrease in prothrombin time from 27 +/- 7 sec to 12 +/- 1 sec, PTT from 61 +/- 10 sec to 31 +/- 2 sec, and an increase in factor V from 9 +/- 4% to 69 +/- 18% and factor VII from 11 +/- 5% to 71 +/- 20%. Five responders with NANB hepatitis relapsed upon discontinuation of therapy, with recurrence of HE and increases in AST and PT but improvement was observed upon retreatment. After four weeks of intravenous therapy, oral PGE2 was substituted. Two patients have recovered completely and remain in remission six and 12 months following cessation of therapy. Two additional patients continue in remission after two and six months of PGE2. No relapses have been seen in patients with hepatitis A virus (HAV) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Liver biopsies in the 12 surviving patients have returned to normal. These results suggest efficacy of PGE for FHF. Further investigation is warranted.\r"

  ".W": "In describing acute liver failure, the term fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is used to denote patients with the most rapid progression, normally defined as the onset of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. For patients with a slower onset of encephalopathy, ranging from eight weeks to six months after the onset of symptoms, late-onset hepatic failure is the term used to reflect the overlap in clinical features with some patients with FHF. The importance of accurately determining the type of acute liver failure results from increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between the tempo of disease progression and the chances of recovery. Prognosis is also dependent on the underlying etiology. Principles of management are as follows: (1) an accurate recognition of the tempo of the hepatic failure--fulminant, late onset, acute on chronic--and the establishment of a likely etiology; (2) early detection and treatment of complications, particularly metabolic acidosis (early), renal failure, cerebral edema, and infection (late); (3) optimization of conditions for regeneration by maintenance of a near normal metabolic milieu (with removal of toxins by various methods of artificial liver support if necessary); and (4) early consideration of an orthotopic liver transplant for those patients in the poor prognosis group. Variations in the natural history and clinical features of acute liver failure (ALF) have led to a number of different classifications and subgroupings. Knowledge of these is important in relation to the assessment of prognosis and is even more important now that transplantation is a therapeutic option.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Though there are no known documented reports that this practice has been responsible for harmful events in patients, likewise there are no published data to verify the safety and efficacy of this practice. This study utilized an in vitro model flow system to examine the physicochemical phenomena that occur when two incompatible drugs (phenytoin and total parenteral nutrition) are simultaneously administered through multilumen catheters. Flow conditions and drug infusions in the venous model were designed to mimic the in vivo clinical situation to evaluate two central venous catheter types, a double- and a triple-lumen catheter. Video recordings were made of drug interactions, and assays of phenytoin concentration were performed on samples of the circulating fluid. White clouds of phenytoin precipitation were observed near the tip of the double-lumen catheter but not the triple-lumen catheter. Infusion through the double-lumen catheter resulted in an average of 6% loss of phenytoin to precipitate, which, on microscopic examination, appeared as spindle-shaped crystals 25 to 50 microns in length and 5 to 10 microns wide. In some cases, millimeter-size fragments of phenytoin precipitate were seen to dislodge from the tip of the double-lumen catheter. The adjacent orifices at the tip of the end hole of the double-lumen catheter appeared to permit interaction of the two effusing streams of the incompatible drugs, whereas the staggered orifices of the triple-lumen catheter reduce this interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The purposes of this study were to (1) examine the acquisition of basic critical care nursing knowledge after completion of an undergraduate course in critical care, (2) compare the differences in learning between students who completed only the theory component of the course and those who completed both theory and clinical practice in critical care, (3) examine learner perceptions toward critical care nursing, and (4) examine the impact of the course on selection by new graduates of critical care as their practice specialty. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design was used with two experimental groups: lecture only and lecture and clinical practice, and a randomized control group. Subjects were 85 senior nursing students in a baccalaureate program in a large metropolitan area in the Midwest. Data were collected by using a demographic data sheet, the Basic Knowledge Assessment Tool (BKAT), the Perceptions of Critical Care Nursing Questionnaire (PCCNQ), and follow-up interviews of graduates who completed the course. Both experimental groups demonstrated a statistically significant increase in learning from pretest and posttest, as measured by the BKAT. There were no significant differences in BKAT scores between the lecture and lecture-clinical practice groups. Mean scores on the BKAT at posttest for the experimental groups, who participated in the course, were significantly higher than the control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The carotid bifurcation with the carotid body was vascularly isolated and excised from pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized cats. The CB was perfused in a chamber by gravity (80 Torr) with modified Tyrode's solution (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid-NaOH at pH 7.40) equilibrated at a given Po2 and superfused with the same medium at (Po2 of 20 Torr). The temperature was maintained at 35.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C. The frequency of chemosensory discharges (CD) was recorded from the whole carotid sinus nerve (n = 24), and the responses were tested by repeated interruptions of perfusate flow (SF), perfusion with hypoxic medium, and injections of nicotine and cyanide (0.1 nmol to 1 mumol) and hypercapnic medium. During hyperoxic perfusion, SF resulted in a sigmoidal increase in CD, reaching a maximum that was 23.6 +/- 4.4-fold greater than the basal activity. Restoration of flow returned CD promptly to basal values. After normoxic perfusion, SF led to a similar maximal activity more rapidly, but the duration was shorter. Reduction of the perfusate PO2 (Po2 from 450 Torr to 150, 30, and less than 10 Torr) caused a nonlinear increase in CD. CO2 stimuli (PCo2 38-110 Torr) resulted in a linear increase in CD. Nicotine or cyanide increased CD in a dose-dependent manner. The preparation retained its initial responsiveness for 2-3 h, making extensive experimental studies feasible.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Seven male and four female healthy college students (23 +/- 2 yr) completed a prolonged exercise protocol on a cycle ergometer at an intensity of 67% of maximal O2 uptake. Venous blood was sampled through an indwelling catheter at rest, after 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 min of exercise, and after 30 min of passive upright recovery.

Coronary angiography was performed 17 +/- 0.8 h after initiation of treatment in 47 patients (group A) or at 10 days in 61 patients (group B). Both groups underwent radionuclide ventriculography 3.8 +/- 0.8 h and again on day 9 after treatment and quantitative thallium scintigraphy on day 8. In group A, the infarct-related artery was patent in 53%; these patients had a smaller global (15.1 +/- 2.5% vs. 25.7 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.029) and regional (14.7 +/- 2.5% vs. 24.1 +/- 4.7%, p = 0.044) fixed thallium defect than did those with an occluded artery. Infarct regional ejection fraction improved by 10.1 +/- 2.1% between early and late studies when the infarct-related artery was patent and by 4.8 +/- 1.4% if it was occluded (p = 0.048); changes in global and noninfarct regional ejection fraction were similar irrespective of perfusion status. Infarct regional ejection fraction and fixed thallium defect were inversely related only when the infarct-related artery was occluded (r = -0.83, p less than 0.0001). In group B, 10 day patency of the infarct-related artery was 67%; there was no difference in patency by treatment assignment or in left ventricular function or infarct size between patients with and without infarct-related artery patency.

  ".W": "Doppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early velocity normalized to the time-velocity integral during diastole is equivalent to volumetric peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume. To compare the pathophysiologic validity of normalized and nonnormalized peak early flow velocity, pulsed Doppler echocardiography with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements was performed in 52 patients with coronary artery disease. Left ventricular loading conditions were changed by intravenous administration of norepinephrine in 15 patients and synthetic atrial natriuretic polypeptide in 15 others. Norepinephrine increased nonnormalized and normalized peak early flow velocities in association with significantly elevated end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures and decelerated the time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decline. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide did not change either nonnormalized or normalized peak early flow velocity, despite significant reductions in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressure and an accelerated time constant. Normalized peak early flow velocity showed the highest univariate correlation with long-term change in mitral valve opening pressure (n = 52, r = 0.67, p less than 0.0001). It provided a modest univariate correlation (n = 30, r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001) with immediate change in mitral valve opening pressure during norepinephrine infusion, whereas this correlation was lower (n = 30, r = 0.57, p less than 0.001) during polypeptide infusion. However, multivariate regression analysis relating normalized peak velocity with long- and short-term changes in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures, time constant and constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness improved the correlation coefficients (r = 0.80 to 0.85, all p less than 0.0001). In contrast, neither univariate nor multivariate correlations of nonnormalized velocity with long- and short-term changes in these hemodynamic variables were satisfactory. Thus, nonnormalized peak early flow velocity does not directly reflect underlying hemodynamic changes in humans. Normalization to mitral stroke volume clarifies the dependence of peak early flow velocity on the determinants of early diastolic filling. When left ventricular early diastolic filling is evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, normalized peak early flow velocity should be taken into consideration.\r"

Mean seated blood pressure (+/- SE) was significantly reduced from 200 +/- 8/122 +/- 3 to 144 +/- 5/89 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) at 1 year. After 6 months, left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced by 19% from 121 +/- 8 to 96 +/- 7 g/m2 and this reduction was sustained at 1 year. Septal and posterior wall thickness were reduced from 13.4 +/- 0.1 to 11.2 +/- 0.04 mm and from 12.8 +/- 0.1 to 10.0 +/- 0.03 mm (p less than 0.001), respectively. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy decreased from 63% to 25%. Left ventricular fractional shortening increased from 34 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 3% (p less than 0.05) and the relation between fractional shortening and end-systolic stress did not change. Over the year of sustained blood pressure reduction, the peak velocity of early filling increased from 57 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 4 cm/s (p = 0.07), peak velocity of late filling did not change and the ratio of late to early peak left ventricular filling velocity significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, markedly elevated at entry, decreased from 70 +/- 15 to 41 +/- 8 pg/ml at 1 year (p less than 0.05).

Both groups were of similar demography; their healing rates were also similar. Cumulative intent-to-treat healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 48%, ranitidine 41%: at 6 weeks enprostil 65%, ranitidine 68%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 72%, ranitidine 80%. Of those patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, and were endoscoped at the prescribed times, healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 55%, ranitidine 54%, at 6 weeks enprostil 75%, ranitidine 84%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 80%, ranitidine 90%. Relief of pain was rapid and similar in both groups. The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in the two groups. The treatment-free relapse rate at 6 months was enprostil 64%, ranitidine 49%; the median times to relapse were 169 and 203 days, respectively. Enprostil and ranitidine appear to be equally effective in healing gastric ulcers.\r"

Nine patients on the same isoosmolar formula were evaluated for diarrhea. Patients were interviewed daily as to whether they thought diarrhea was present or absent. Frequency of defecation was recorded, and stool was collected daily for weight. When assessed subjectively, the incidence of diarrhea rose from 11% on day 1, to 25% on day 4, and to 43% by day 6. The group (n = 4) complaining of diarrhea averaged 3.0 bowel movements per day, whereas those denying diarrhea (n = 5) averaged fewer than 0.2 bowel movements per day (p less than 0.01). Stool weight, however, plateaued for all patients by day 6 at 52.7 +/- 35.7 g of stool per day. No patient produced in excess of 250 g of stool per day. We suggest that traditional subjective measures for assessing diarrhea may be flawed and should not be relied upon when evaluating and treating tube feeding-associated diarrhea.\r"

  ".U": "91237068\r", 
  ".W": "Prosolin is a major cytosolic phosphoprotein expressed prominently in rapidly proliferating human peripheral lymphocytes but produced at very low levels in resting (G0) PBL. It undergoes rapid phosphorylation upon treatment of growing cells with tumor-producing phorbol esters (TPA) and this phosphorylation event is correlated with a rapid down-regulation of DNA synthesis. In the present report we have studied various agents that, like TPA, act as partial or complete mitogens for G0 PBL and have determined their effect on phosphorylation of prosolin and on DNA synthesis in rapidly proliferating (IL-2-dependent) human PBL. Agents that activate the TCR (OKT3 and PHA), as well as agents that by-pass the receptor but activate biochemical pathways associated with TCR activation (TPA and Ca2(+)-ionophore), all produced rapid phosphorylation of prosolin and prompt down-regulation of DNA synthesis. Four phosphorylated forms of prosolin were produced, indicating activation of a complex phosphorylation pathway. Down-regulation of DNA synthesis did not lead to cell death or to permanent arrest, but was reversed after 24 to 48 h, and was not associated with any reduction in overall protein synthesis. Agents that bind to determinants closely connected to the TCR but without activating it (OKT4 and OKT8) had no effect on either prosolin phosphorylation or DNA synthesis. The results indicate that prosolin is an early target of the protein kinase activities induced by activation of the TCR in proliferating PBL, and suggest that its phosphorylation mediates the TCR signal, transmitting it into a biochemical pathway leading specifically to down-regulation of DNA synthesis. In G0 PBL, in which the negligible expression of prosolin precludes significant production of phosphorylated species, this inhibitory pathway is effectively blocked.\r"

In the present study we show that the activation state of p21ras in T lymphocytes can also be controlled by triggering of the CD2 Ag. The activation state of p21ras is controlled by GTP levels on p21ras. In T cells stimulation of protein kinase C is able to induce an accumulation of \"active\" p21ras-GTP complexes due to an inhibitory effect of protein kinase C stimulation on the intrinsic GTPase activity of p21ras. The regulatory effect of protein kinase C on p21ras GTPase activity appears to be mediated via regulation of GAP, the GTPase activating protein of p21ras. In the present report, we demonstrate that the TCR/CD3 complex and the CD2 Ag control the accumulation of p21ras-GTP complexes via a regulatory effect on p21ras GTPase activity. The TCR/CD3 complex and CD2 Ag are also able to control the cellular activity of GAP. These data demonstrate that p21ras is part of the signal transduction responses controlled by the CD2 Ag, and reveal that the TCR/CD3 complex and CD2 Ag control the activation state of p21ras via a similar mechanism.\r"

Previous studies have demonstrated that these toxins are potent stimulators of human T cells and have structural homology to staphylococcal enterotoxins. In the current study, we investigated the mechanism by which streptococcal erythrogenic toxins type A (SPEA) and B (SPEB) activate T cells and compared it with anti-CD3 and the known \"superantigen\" staphylococcal enterotoxin B. SPEA was found to selectively activate T cells bearing V beta 8, V beta 12, and V beta 14, whereas SPEB selectively activated T cells bearing V beta 2 and V beta 8. Furthermore, fibroblasts transfected with MHC class II molecules were capable of presenting SPEA and SPEB to purified T cells. The T cell response to these toxins, however, was not MHC-restricted. Although the streptococcal exotoxins stimulated both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, SPEA but not SPEB stimulated the CD4+ T cell subset proportionately more than the CD8+ T cell subset. Our results indicate that SPEA and SPEB, like the staphylococcal enterotoxins, are superantigens and suggest a mechanism by which they may mediate particular systemic syndromes associated with streptococcal infections.\r"

TOMS-1 (IgG1) detected a unique cell surface Ag with a molecular mass of about 43 kDa under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. TOMS-1Ag was expressed on monocytes treated with GM-CSF, but not on fresh or untreated monocytes. This Ag was induced dose dependently during culture of monocytes with GM-CSF for more than 24 h, reaching a maximum level in 3 or 4 days. Treatment of monocytes with cycloheximide in the presence of GM-CSF blocked TOMS-1Ag induction completely, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was required for its expression. TOMS-1Ag was also induced by treatment of monocytes with IL-3, but not with other cytokines such as macrophage-CSF, IL-4, and IFN-gamma or stimulators including LPS, desmethyl muramyl dipeptide, and PMA. TOMS-1Ag expression induced by GM-CSF was up-regulated by IL-4, but down-regulated by IFN-gamma. TOMS-1Ag was not induced on lymphocytes, granulocytes, or AM by GM-CSF or appropriate stimuli. TOMS-1Ag was also not expressed on any cell lines of human leukemias or solid tumors examined. Thus, TOMS-1Ag is a monocyte-specific differentiation Ag induced by GM-CSF or IL-3. These results suggest that TOMS-1 should be useful for monitoring the process of monocyte differentiation by GM-CSF or IL-3.\r"

However, the signaling events and regulatory mechanisms required for the activation of macrophages by LPS have not been resolved precisely. We show that LPS modulates its own response in macrophages. Proteose peptone-induced murine peritoneal macrophages (P-PEM) produce significant amount of TNF-alpha and IL-1 after stimulation with LPS. However, preexposure of macrophages to low doses (less than 1 ng/ml) of LPS renders them refractory to stimulation by a second round of LPS, as evaluated by production of TNF-alpha. The loss of sensitivity to a second round of LPS was selective for TNF-alpha production as the LPS-primed macrophages retained the ability to produce IL-1. Northern blot analysis was performed with total RNA obtained from control and LPS- (1 ng/ml) primed P-PEM after 3-h stimulation with a second round of LPS. The expression of TNF-alpha mRNA was inhibited in LPS-primed P-PEM, whereas the expression of IL-1 beta mRNA was the same in control and LPS-primed P-PEM, consistent with the data of biologic activities of these two cytokines. Zymosan-induced TNF-alpha production was the same in control and LPS-primed macrophages, indicating that not all of the pathways required for TNF-alpha production were affected by LPS priming. Monokines such as human (h) rIL-1 alpha, hrTNF-alpha, hrIL-6, and murine rIFN-beta could not substitute for the action of low doses of LPS, and addition of indomethacin could not restore TNF-alpha production. These results suggest that exposure of macrophages to low doses of LPS suppresses the production of TNF-alpha, but not of IL-1, by inhibiting the expression of mRNA through a noncyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism. Thus, LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-1 in macrophages are differently regulated.\r"

Monomethyl-L-arginine (NGMMLA), the competitive inhibitor of L-arginine as substrate for production of nitric oxides by hepatocytes, reversed the activity of IFN-gamma on these malaria-infected cells. Reversal of IFN-gamma activity by NGMMLA was dose dependent and was maximal at 0.5 mM NGMMLA. Depletion of L-arginine by addition of arginase to the culture medium blocked the capacity of IFN-gamma to inhibit parasite development in hepatocytes; addition of excess L-arginine to cultures treated with IFN-gamma in the presence of NGMMLA competitively restored IFN-gamma capacity to activate hepatocyte anti-parasite activity. TNF-alpha was neither required for IFN-gamma activity, nor effective at any concentration tested as an inhibitor of schizont development by itself in primary hepatocytes. These data strongly suggest that the action of IFN-gamma on P. berghei-infected hepatocytes is to induce the production of L-arginine-derived nitrogen oxides that are toxic for the intracellular parasite.\r"

To begin to identify the molecular basis for both of these phenomena in B cells, we performed a deletional analysis of the upstream region of the murine E beta gene. We show that there are several cooperating positive as well as negative control elements in the E beta upstream region. The sequence between -2679 and -66 is a strong transcriptional element containing several sequences that act synergistically as positive elements. The negative elements are located more proximal to the transcription start site. Furthermore, two consensus motifs, termed X and Y, which are located in the proximal upstream region of all class II genes, are necessary for the transcriptional activity of more distal elements. Additionally, we identify an IL-4-responsive element located within 666 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site.\r"

  ".W": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits B cell Ig secretion and reduces B cell membrane Ig expression. The addition of TGF-beta to human B lymphocyte cultures stimulated with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I and IL-2 completely inhibited B cell Ig secretion (greater than 90%) and decreased B cell surface IgM, IgD, kappa L chain, and lambda L chain expression. In contrast, TGF-beta had only minimal effects on two other B cell membrane proteins, HLA-DR and CD20. Internal labeling with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation with anti-IgM, anti-kappa, and anti-lambda antibodies revealed a striking reduction in kappa L chain in the presence of TGF-beta. A less pronounced reduction in lambda L chain and microH chain was also noted. Northern blot analysis of RNA purified from B cells treated with TGF-beta for varying time intervals revealed a significant decrease in steady state kappa and lambda L chain mRNA levels. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the switch from the membrane forms of mu and gamma to their respective secreted forms was noted in the presence of TGF-beta. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrated decreased transcription of kappa L chain. The effects of TGF-beta on two transcriptional regulatory factors, Oct-2 and nuclear factor (NF) kappa B, known to be important in Ig gene transcription were examined. Oct-2 mRNA levels and both Oct-2 and NF-kappa B proteins in nuclear extracts were not altered by treatment with TGF-beta. In contrast, levels of the transcriptional factor AP-1, which is not known to be important in B cell Ig production, were reduced by TGF-beta. These findings demonstrate that TGF-beta decreases B lymphocyte Ig secretion by inhibiting the synthesis of Ig mRNA and inhibiting the switch from the membrane form to the secreted forms of mu and gamma mRNA. The mechanism by which TGF-beta inhibits Ig chain synthesis is unclear although it does not involve inhibition of the binding of NF-kappa B or Oct-2 to their respective target sequences.\r"

Our data show that 262.9 and 16.3 Ab display identical V lambda 1 and very similar VH regions when compared with BALB/c anti-alpha (1-3) dextran Ab expressing IdI104 or IdI558, respectively. The two Ab (414.2 and 126.33) that express both IdI104 and IdI558 Id display two main features. First, their VH CDR3 are different from those found in IdI104 or IdI558 expressing anti-alpha(1-3) dextran Ab. Second, their V lambda 1 are identical to those from BALB/c origin except for the presence of an additional residue, a phenylalanine at position 95A of CDR3. This additional residue is encoded by the V lambda 1 gene segment and results from a hitherto undescribed V lambda 1-J lambda 1 junction. The alteration of the length of the V lambda 1 CDR3 loop, in conjunction with particular residues within VH CDR3, allows the coexpression of two Id that were found to be mutually exclusive in laboratory mice.\r"

One clone, lambda XIg23, reacted with antibodies to IgY and to IgM; the insert hybridized to approximately 1.3-kb RNA from spleen, the approximate size expected for L chain mRNA. An additional clone, lambda XIg31, was identified by cross-hybridization. The inserts of lambda XIg23 and lambda XIg31 begin in the third framework region of the V region and extend through the C region to the poly(A) tail. Except for a single nucleotide difference, the two C region sequences are identical. The amino acid sequence of the C region was compared with the sequences of a variety of C kappa and C lambda, as well as to C region sequences of L chains from Rana catesbeiana and from two species of shark. The Xenopus C region resembles mouse and human C kappa slightly more than C lambda. The similarity of the Xenopus and Rana C regions to each other is approximately the same as that of either amphibian sequence to mammalian CL. The data are discussed in terms of the evolution of kappa and lambda C regions.\r"

The relationship between pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images was investigated with special reference to increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on the T2-weighted images and the relevance of this finding to clinical conditions. Preoperatively, there were areas of increased signal intensity in 12 patients whereas there were no areas of increased signal intensity in the other 17. The lesions were not clearly demonstrated on T1-weighted images. The pre- and postoperative clinical condition of the patients whose preoperative MR images showed areas of increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted images was worse than that of the patients who did not have areas of increased signal intensity. Of the 12 patients with regions of increased signal intensity preoperatively, five showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels and seven had no change. The postoperative recovery of the five patients who showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively was better than that of the seven patients who exhibited no change. The areas of increased MR signal in the spinal cord might be due to edema, cord gliosis, demyelination, or microcavities.\r"

In colonic cells, the decreasing order of oxidation was as follows: butyrate greater than acetate greater than propionate, glucose and glutamine. Acetate and butyrate significantly suppressed oxidation of both glucose and glutamine. In cells taken from the cecum, butyrate was oxidized at a greater rate than all other substrates. Cells taken from the jejunum produced CO2 from exogenous substrates in decreasing order as follows: glutamine greater than glucose much greater than acetate, propionate and butyrate. Butyrate oxidation was significantly reduced in colonic cells by 3-hydroxybutyrate, and it was reduced in cecal cells by glucose. Comparisons among the three gut segments showed no differences in glutamine oxidation. Glucose oxidation was greater in cells taken from the colon than from the cecum or jejunum, which were similar. Butyrate and acetate were oxidized at higher rates in cells taken from the cecum and colon than in cells taken from the jejunum, and propionate was oxidized at a greater rate in cells taken from the colon than from the jejunum. These studies demonstrate that relative rates of substrate oxidation differ along the intestinal tract of rats.\r"

Under conditions that did not reduce or that potentiated twitches, both procedures reduced the size of the tetanic responses. This depression was seen as an inability to maintain the maximum tetanic tension for more than 0.5 sec. Intracellular microelectrode recordings showed that the muscle fibers were depolarized (mean about 23 mV) during the stimulus train and the fiber only slowly repolarized after the train. The latter effect is the \"late negative afterpotential\" and it is produced by the accumulation of K+ ions in the t-tubules during the action potential train. Neither the depolarization nor the late negative afterpotentials were decreased in amplitude by nitrendipine. These results indicate that the voltage-sensitive, slow Ca++ channels are opened by the accumulation of K+ ions in the t-tubules during the tetanus and that the Ca++ ions entering via these channels are required to maintain the full strength of the tetanic contraction. It is suggested that this is a function of these Ca++ channels concentrated in the t-tubules of skeletal muscle fibers.\r"

  ".W": "This study tests the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and the ANF clearance receptor binding peptide, cANF(4-23)-NH2 (cANF), inhibit adrenergic and purinergic neurotransmission in the rabbit isolated vas deferens by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive mechanism. The vas deferens is a unique model used in the study of autonomic neurotransmission inasmuch as it has both a purinergic or twitch contraction and an adrenergic or tonic contraction associated with its response to electrical stimulation. Both ANF and cANF (10(-11) to 10(-6) M) inhibited electrically induced purinergic and adrenergic contractile force generation in a concentration-dependent manner. The ANF effect on both purinergic and adrenergic contractions was blocked by PTX (100 ng/ml). The cANF effect on the adrenergic contraction was also PTX-sensitive. Both peptides also attenuated evoked norepinephrine release in a concentration-dependent manner by a PTX-sensitive mechanism. cANF (10(-7) M) had no effect on norepinephrine- or ATP-induced contractions as was shown previously for ANF (10(-7) M). Therefore, the inhibitory effects of ANF and cANF appear to be prejunctional, on the release of the neurotransmitters, norepinephrine and ATP, from the nerve terminal and not postjunctional on the smooth muscle. An effect of cANF on neurotransmission suggests that the reputed \"silent\" ANF clearance receptor has biological activity. PTX-sensitivity suggests the involvement of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in mediating the neuromodulatory effect of atrial peptides.\r"

  ".W": "Previous studies have identified a saturable site of d-[3H]amphetamine sequestration (AMSEQ) in rat brain synaptosomes. The present study characterized AMSEQ with respect to its subcellular, neuronal and regional distributions, ontogenetic development, pharmacological specificity and factors required for its maintenance. Although AMSEQ was reduced when assays were performed in Krebs' buffer incubated at 37 degrees C as compared to assays performed in isotonic Tris-sucrose buffer incubated at room temperature, the pharmacological profiles of AMSEQ were virtually identical under both conditions. AMSEQ was negligible in tissues outside the central nervous system, enriched in synaptosomes and partially reduced by striatal kainic acid lesion, indicating neuronal localization. The distribution of AMSEQ in the central nervous system was heterogenous. Highest levels were present in hypothalamus with progressively lower levels noted in parietal cortex, frontal cortex, striatum, thalamus, hippocampus, midbrain, cerebellum, pons-medulla and spinal cord. With regard to its ontogeny, AMSEQ increased early in neonatal life, reaching adult levels by postnatal day 14. Although the effects of amphetamine to abolish the transynaptosomal pH gradient suggest a possible role for this gradient in the maintenance of AMSEQ, the pharmacological profile of AMSEQ indicates that other factors are involved. An interaction with an intrasynaptosomal acid, such as N-acetylaspartate, may account for AMSEQ maintenance. AMSEQ did not possess a stereospecific preference for either d-(IC50 = 177 microM) or I-amphetamine (IC50 = 173 microM). However, the pharmacological profile of AMSEQ indicated structural specificity with antidepressants being relatively potent inhibitors. The saturation analysis and pharmacological characteristics of AMSEQ (i.e., low affinity and lack of stereospecificity) suggest that AMSEQ may be related to high dose, nonstereospecific effects of amphetamine, such as stereotypy in rats and psychosis in humans. The relative high potency of antidepressants in inhibiting AMSEQ suggests the importance of this phenomenon in the therapeutic effects of these drugs. Furthermore, the link between antidepressants and AMSEQ may provide insight into the comorbidity of major depression and drug abuse.\r"

The accumulation of d-[3H]AMPH into striatal synaptosomes was saturable, of high affinity, ouabain-sensitive and temperature-dependent, suggesting an active transport phenomenon. Eadee-Hofstee analysis of striatal d-[3H]AMPH transport (AMT) saturation isotherms indicated an apparent Km of 97 nM and a Vmax of 3.0 fmol/mg tissue/min. Lesion of the striatal dopaminergic innervation led to equivalent decreases of [3H] dopamine (DA) transport and AMT, indicating that AMT occurs in DA terminals. Furthermore, AMT was not evident in cerebral cortex, a brain region with a paucity of DA terminals. In competition studies, AMT was stereospecific; d-AMPH (IC50 = 60 nM) was an 8-fold more potent inhibitor of the transport than its I-isomer (IC50 = 466 nM). DA(IC50 = 257 nM), DA uptake blockers and substrates were found to be potent inhibitors of AMT: GBR12909 IC50 = 5 nM; methamphetamine IC50 = 48 nM; methylphenidate IC50 = 53 nM; and cocaine IC50 = 172 nM. In contrast, serotonin was relatively weak in inhibiting AMT (IC50 = 7.9 microM). There was a highly significant (P less than .001; slope = 1.2) linear correlation between the AMT-inhibiting potencies of AMPH analogs and their potencies in stimulating locomotor activity in rodents. AMT may be important in the low dose effects of AMPH such as increased locomotor activity in rodents and stimulant activity in man. Differences between AMT and d-[3H]AMPH sequestration described earlier, as well as their possible relevance to behavioral and neurochemical sequelae of AMPH administration are also discussed.\r"

When brain sections were incubated with [125I]iodoglyburide (N-[2-[[[(cyclohexylamino)carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]ethyl]-5-125I-2- methoxybenzamide), the ligand bound to a single site with a KD of 495 pM and a maximum binding site density of 176 fmol/mg of tissue. Glyburide was the most potent inhibitor of specific [125I]iodoglyburide binding to rat forebrain sections whereas iodoglyburide and glipizide were slightly less potent. The binding was also sensitive to ATP which completely inhibited binding at concentrations of 10 mM. Autoradiographic localization of [125I]iodoglyburide binding indicated a broad distribution of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in the brain. The highest levels of binding were seen in the globus pallidus and ventral pallidum followed by the septohippocampal nucleus, anterior pituitary, the CA2 and CA3 region of the hippocampus, ventral pallidum, the molecular layer of the cerebellum and substantia nigra zona reticulata. The hilus and dorsal subiculum of the hippocampus, molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, cerebral cortex, lateral olfactory tract nucleus, olfactory tubercle and the zona incerta contained relatively high levels of binding. A lower level of binding (approximately 3- to 4-fold) was found throughout the remainder of the brain. These results indicate that the ATP-sensitive potassium channel has a broad presence in the rat brain and that a few select brain regions are enriched in this subtype of neuronal potassium channels.\r"

The most significant inhibition occurred with cysteine and this inhibition was concentration-dependent. In rats made hyperoxaluric by administering ethylene glycol in their drinking water, daily intraperitoneal injections of cysteine caused a rapid and marked decrease in urinary oxalate excretion which was maintained over the duration of the treatment (28 days). Over this time period, the level of urinary oxalate excretion in these ethylene glycol-treated rats was reduced to that of the controls. It is postulated that the decrease is due to the formation of a cysteine-glyoxylate adduct, 2-carboxy-4-thiazolidine carboxylate, which prevents glyoxylate being further oxidized to oxalate. Cysteine or similar sulphydryl compounds may therefore have potential as therapeutic agents in the prevention of renal stones.\r"

  ".U": "91238969\r", 
  ".W": "More than thirty small guanine nucleotide-binding proteins related to the ras-encoded oncoprotein, termed Ras or p21ras, are known. They regulate many fundamental processes in all eukaryotic cells, such as growth, vesicle traffic and cytoskeletal organization. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of Ras-related proteins, leading to down-regulation of the active GTP-bound form. For p21ras, two GAP proteins are known, rasGAP and the neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene product. There is evidence that rasGAP may also be a target protein for regulation by Ras and be involved in downstream signalling. We have purified a GAP protein for p21rho, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Partial sequencing of rhoGAP reveals significant homology with the product of the bcr (breakpoint cluster region) gene, the translocation breakpoint in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemias. We show here that the carboxy-terminal domains of the bcr-encoded protein (Bcr) and of a Bcr-related protein, n-chimaerin, are both GAP proteins for the Ras-related GTP-binding protein, p21rac. This result suggest that Bcr could be a target for regulation by Rac and has important new implications for the role of bcr translocations in leukaemia.\r"

  ".U": "91238973\r", 
  ".W": "Temperature-sensitive paralysis is the most striking defect of adult Drosophila carrying the shibire mutation. This is believed to be due to a reversible block of endocytosis, which prevents membrane cycling and thus depletes synaptic vesicles. The shibire mutation also affects many tissues outside the nervous system. We have now mapped and characterized the shibire gene. A 275-kilobase yeast artificial chromosome was subcloned into cosmids, among which the gene was then located by analysing with restriction-fragment length polymorphisms. A 15-kilobase fragment of wild-type DNA rescues the mutant phenotype and the sequence of two mutant alleles show differences with wild type, demonstrating that we have isolated the shibire gene. The gene encodes a protein that is highly similar to rat dynamin, 69% of the amino-acid sequence is identical. Dynamin is a GTP-driven mechanochemical enzyme related to mammalian mx-proteins and to the yeast vps 1 gene product. Because the shibire gene product and dynamin have extensive similarity, we propose that they are cognate homologues. Dynamin causes microtubules to slide along each other in vitro and in extracts it is associated with a distinct, but so far uncharacterized, membrane fraction. In light of the shibire phenotype, we suggest that these proteins provide the motor for vesicular transport during endocytosis.\r"

The determinant for both assembly and degradation is located in a segment of eight residues containing two basic amino acids. We show here that placement of a single basic residue in the transmembrane domain of the Tac antigen can induce interaction with the CD3 chain, through its transmembrane acidic residue. This interaction is most favoured when the interacting residues are located at the same level in the membrane. The ability to induce protein-protein interaction by placing charge pairs within transmembrane domains suggests an approach to producing artificial dimers.\r"

To examine possible solutions to this health care delivery problem, a cross-sectional survey of all the neonatal intensive care units in North Carolina was performed to examine characteristics of patients occupying the beds in these facilities. It was found that a substantial amount of chronic care is now occurring in neonatal intensive care beds, with 38% of occupants of neonatal intensive care beds being 31 days of age or older and 3% being mechanically ventilated at 91 days of age or older. In addition, according to criteria established for this study, a substantial number of \"convalescent\" patients (32%) were occupying beds in neonatal intensive care units. It is concluded that an increase in both intermediate/convalescent care beds and establishment of chronic care facilities in North Carolina, rather than an increase in intensive care beds in these units, would alleviate the shortage of neonatal intensive care facilities. Further, the characteristics of the population occupying neonatal intensive care unit beds should be considered by health planners in addition to occupancy rate, when new facilities are being established.\r"

This simplified system replaces the complex enzymatic system of protein components A2, A3a, A3b, and ATP, which previously represented the only available means of reactivating the enzyme. Components necessary for light activation include N-(7-mercaptoheptanoyl)-L-threonine O3-phosphate (HS-HTP), CH3-S-CoM, titanium(III) citrate [Ti(III)Cit], and light above 400 nm. Photoactivation was inhibited by known inhibitors of methanogenesis: 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), N-(6-mercaptohexanoyl)-L-threonine O3-phosphate, N-(8-mercaptooctanoyl)-L-threonine O3-phosphate, and sodium dithionite. Methanogenesis continued when the light-activated reaction mixture was incubated in the dark. Although the specific activity was low (35 nmol of CH4 per h per mg of protein) the reaction products methane and the unsymmetrical disulfide of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (HS-CoM) and HS-HTP were identified.

Although the regression of experimental pancreatic cancers induced by treatment with LHRH agonists or antagonists could be explained in part by the creation of sex-steroid deficiency, direct effects mediated by LHRH receptors might also play a role. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic tumor cells do exhibit high-affinity binding sites for LHRH, but only in their nuclei; low-affinity sites are associated with the cell membranes. These binding sites appear to be LHRH receptors since electron microscopic immunohistochemical studies show that an antibody to the LHRH receptor reacted with sites in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor cells. Immunoreactive sites in the nucleus also were found in a restricted set of normal hamster pituitary cells thought to be luteinizing hormone-secreting cells and in MXT mouse mammary tumor cells. Such nuclear receptors may be involved in the transmission of the direct action of LHRH analogues on the tumor cells, resulting in the enhancement of programmed cell death.\r"

  ".U": "91239528\r", 
  ".W": "The ferritin iron regulatory element (IRE), a conserved sequence of 28 nucleotides in a hairpin loop, is a conserved mRNA-specific translational regulatory element; flanking the IRE are regions of varying sequence, which form 9-17 base pairs close to the 5' cap. P-90 is a ferritin mRNA-specific translation regulatory protein purified from animal liver and reticulocytes. To study the P-90-RNA interaction, protein nucleases (RNase S1 and T1) and chemical nucleases FeEDTA and/or 1,10-phenanthroline-Cu were used as probes of an oligonucleotide (n = 55), containing the IRE and flanking regions (FL), and natural ferritin mRNA. Footprints and \"toeprints\" showed that P-90 binding was confined to the stem and loop of the IRE itself. However, P-90 altered the structure of the flanking region by increasing base stacking or helicity (RNase V1 sensitivity). Comparison of the reactivity of the IRE and flanking regions in natural mRNA and the 55-mer showed that long-range interactions included protecting bulges, single-stranded, and stacked regions from protein nucleases as well as stabilizing the P-90-RNA interaction. Structural integration of the IRE with the base-paired flanking regions was indicated by common features of reactivity (periodic hypersensitivity to FeEDTA) and changes in the FL region caused by P-90. The increased secondary structure of the IRE flanking regions caused by P-90 binding to the IRE provides a likely mechanism for blocking initiation of ferritin mRNA translation, since the combined structure (IRE + FL) is so close (8-17 nucleotides) to the cap.\r"

When compared to a chimeric form of the CD4 antibody, the avidity of the KOL-based reshaped antibody was only slightly reduced, whereas that of the NEW-based reshaped antibody was very poor.

  ".U": "91239537\r", 
  ".W": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enkephalinase, two cell surface metallopeptidases, are responsible for angiotensin II formation and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) degradation, respectively, and thereby play a critical role in the metabolism of hormonal peptides exerting essentially opposite actions in cardiovascular regulations. To affect simultaneously both hormonal systems by a single molecular structure, we have designed glycoprilat and alatrioprilat [(S)-N-[3-(3,4-methylene-dioxyphenyl)-2-(mercaptomethyl)-1-oxoprop yl] glycine and -alanine, respectively]. In vitro the two compounds inhibit both ACE and enkephalinase activities with similar, nanomolar potencies, and in vivo, glycopril and alatriopril, the corresponding diester prodrugs, occupy the two enzyme molecules in lung at similar low dosages (0.2-0.5 mg/kg of body weight, per os). The high potency of these compounds is attributable to interaction of the methylenedioxy group with the S1 subsite of ACE and of the aromatic ring with the S1' subsite of enkephalinase. In rodents, low doses of these mixed inhibitors exert typical actions of ACE inhibitors--i.e., prevention of angiotensin I-induced hypertension--as well as of enkephalinase inhibitors--i.e., protection from 125I-ANF degradation or enhancement of diuresis and natriuresis following acute extracellular volume expansion. In view of the known counterbalanced physiological actions of the two hormonal peptides, whose metabolism is controlled by ACE and enkephalinase, mixed inhibitors of the two peptidases show promise for the treatment of various cardiovascular and salt-retention disorders.\r"

  ".W": "Ternary complexes of RNA polymerase II, bearing the nascent RNA transcript, are intermediates in the synthesis of all eukaryotic mRNAs and are implicated as regulatory targets of factors that control RNA chain elongation and termination. Information as to the structure of such complexes is essential in understanding the catalytic and regulatory properties of the RNA polymerase. We have prepared complexes of purified RNA polymerase II halted at defined positions along a DNA template and used RNase footprinting to map interactions of the polymerase with the nascent RNA. Unexpectedly, the transcript is sensitive to cleavage by RNases A and T1 at positions as close as 3 nucleotides from the 3'-terminal growing point. Ternary complexes in which the transcript has been cleaved to give a short fragment can retain that fragment and remain active and able to continue elongation. Since DNA.RNA hybrid structures are completely resistant to cleavage under our reaction conditions, the results suggest that any DNA.RNA hybrid intermediate can extend for no more than 3 base pairs, in dramatic contrast to recent models for transcription elongation. At lower RNase concentrations, the transcript is protected from cleavage out to about 24 nucleotides from the 3' terminus. We interpret this partial protection as due to the presence of an RNA binding site on the polymerase that binds the nascent transcript during elongation, a model proposed earlier by several workers in preference to the hybrid model. The properties of this RNA binding site are likely to play a central role in the process of transcription elongation and termination and in their regulation.\r"

  ".U": "91239548\r", 
  ".W": "Second-derivative absorption spectra are reported for a variety of oxidation and ligation states of bovine cytochrome c oxidase (ferrocytochrome-c:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.9.3.1). The high resolving power of the second-derivative method allows us to assign the individual electronic transitions of cytochrome alpha and cytochrome alpha 3 in many of these states. In the fully reduced enzyme, one observes a single electronic transition at 444 nm, corresponding to the Soret transition for both ferrous cytochrome alpha and ferrous cytochrome alpha 3. When the cytochrome alpha 3 site is occupied by an exogenous ligand (CN or CO), one observes two absorption bands assignable to the ferrous cytochrome alpha chromophore, one at ca, 443 nm and the other at ca, 450 nm. The appearance of the 450-nm band is dependent only on ligand occupancy at the cytochrome alpha 3 site and not on the oxidation state of the cytochrome alpha 3 iron. These results can be interpreted either in terms of a heterogeneous mixture of two ferrous cytochrome alpha conformers in the cytochrome alpha 3-ligated enzyme or in terms of a reduction in the effective molecular symmetry of the ferrous cytochrome alpha site that results in a lifting of the degeneracy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital associated with the Soret pi,pi* transition of cytochrome alpha. In either case, the present data indicate that ferrous cytochrome alpha can adopt two distinct conformations. One possible structural difference between these two states could be related to differences in the strength of hydrogen bonding between the ferrous cytochrome alpha formyl oxygen and a proton donor from an unidentified amino acid side chain of the enzyme. The implications of such modulation of hydrogen-bond strength are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms of proton translocation and electron transfer in the enzyme.\r"

The clone contained an 11.8-kilobase-pair DNA insert. Sequencing of the insert DNA in the region of the mutation in RKa revealed an open reading frame (designated as ndhB), which showed extensive amino acid sequence homology to the subunit-2 genes of NADH dehydrogenase (EC 1.6.99.3) (ndhB) of chloroplasts and mitochondria. The homology was much stronger with the chloroplast genes. Sequence analysis of the ndhB gene of RKa mutant revealed a G----A substitution that results in a Gly----Asp substitution in the deduced amino acid. A defined mutant (M55), constructed by inactivating the ndhB gene in wild-type Synechocystis, required high CO2 conditions for growth and was unable to transport CO2 and HCO3- into the intracellular Ci pool. The results indicate that the ndhB gene is required for Ci transport. Dark respiration was also depressed by the inactivation of the ndhB gene. A possible role of the ndhB gene product in the energization of Ci transport is discussed.\r"

  ".W": "Transcriptional regulation of the human major histocompatibility complex class II genes requires at least two upstream elements, the X and Y boxes, located in the -50- to -150-base-pair region of all class II promoters. The DRA and DPB promoters contain phorbol ester-responsive elements overlapping the 3' side of their X boxes. Mutation of this sequence down-regulates the efficiency of the DRA promoter, suggesting that a positive regulator(s) binds to this site. In this report, anti-sense c-fos RNA and an anti-c-fos antibody were used to show that the product of the protooncogene c-fos or an antigenically related protein is a component of a complex that binds to the X box and is required for maximal transcription from the DRA and DPB promoters. As c-fos (or its related proteins) cannot bind alone to DNA, these results suggest that it may dimerize with other members of the JUN/AP-1 family, such as hXBP1, to participate in the activation of a subset of class II major histocompatibility complex genes.\r"

  ".W": "A complementary DNA encoding a member of the leucine-zipper class of proteins (human X-box-binding protein, hXBP-1) that binds to the 3' end of the conserved X box (X2) of the HLA-DRA major histocompatibility complex gene was recently described. Further gel-retardation analysis has demonstrated that hXBP-1 also binds to HLA-DPB X2 but not to other X2 sequences. Transient transfection of a mammalian expression vector with the hXBP-1 cDNA inserted in the antisense orientation represses the surface expression of HLA-DR and HLA-DP in Raji cells. Cotransfection of the antisense hXBP-1 vector with a HLA-DRA/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (but not a HLA-DQB/chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter plasmid decreases chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in Raji cells and in gamma-interferon-treated HeLa cells relative to cells cotransfected with a control antisense vector. Moreover, hXBP-1 is shown to form a stable heterodimer with the product of the c-fos protooncogene. These data suggest that the hXBP-1 c-fos heterodimer is critical for the transcription of a subset of the human class II major histocompatibility complex genes and that the regulatory mechanisms for the different class II genes are distinct.\r"

  ".W": "NF-kappa B is a widely used regulator of inducible and tissue-specific gene control. In the cytosol, when complexed to an inhibitory molecule, I kappa B, NF-kappa B is in an inactive form and cannot bind DNA. Activation of cells with appropriate stimuli results in the dissociation of NF-kappa B from I kappa B and its translocation to the nucleus as an active binding protein. We now demonstrate that NF-kappa B binding in vitro can be inhibited by agents that modify free sulfhydryls. Binding is eliminated after treatment with N-ethylmaleimide, an alkylating agent, and diamide, an oxidizing agent. The diamide effect can be reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol. Further, 2-mercaptoethanol acts synergistically with deoxycholate plus Nonidet P-40 in converting inactive cytosolic NF-kappa B to an active DNA-binding form. It is therefore possible that modulation of the redox state of NF-kappa B could represent a post-translational control mechanism for this factor.\r"

The phosphorylation of frog P gamma was stimulated by phosphatidylinositol but not by cAMP or cGMP. One- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that 70-80% of P gamma was phosphorylated with 1 mol of phosphate per frog P gamma under optimal conditions. A peptide that derived from an active domain of bovine P gamma was also phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of frog P gamma was inhibited by addition of the peptide to the reaction mixture. Phosphorylation of frog P gamma was also inhibited by addition of transducin subunits or active (P gamma-less) cGMP phosphodiesterase. Okadaic acid, on the other hand, enhanced P gamma phosphorylation, suggesting the presence of protein phosphatase(s) in the cytosolic fraction. These data suggest another mechanism for the regulation of cGMP phosphodiesterase in vertebrate rod photoreceptors.\r"

Both loci were found to share in common a different type of homeobox gene, which we call \"BarH1.\" Polyptides encoded by D. melanogaster and D. ananassae BarH1 genes consist of 543 and 604 amino acids, respectively, with homeodomains identical in sequence except for one amino acid substitution. A unique feature of these homeodomains is that the phenylalanine residue in helix 3, conserved in all metazoan homeodomains so far examined, is replaced by a tyrosine residue. By Northern blotting, considerably more BarH1 RNA was detected in the Bar mutant than in wild type. P element-mediated transformation showed Bar-like eye malformation to be induced by transient overexpression of the BarH1 gene in the late third-instar larvae. Somatic recombination analysis indicated normal gene functions of the Bar region, including the BarH1 gene, to be required for normal eye morphogenesis.\r"

To better understand these unusual MHC antigens, full-length B-G cDNA clones were isolated from B21 embryonic erythroid cell cDNA library, restriction-mapped, and sequenced. Five transcript types were identified. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences suggests that the B-G polypeptides are composed of single extracellular domains that resemble immunoglobulin domains of the variable-region (V) type, single membrane-spanning domains typical of integral membrane proteins, and long cytoplasmic tails. Sequence diversity among the five transcript types was found in all domains, notably including the B-G immunoglobulin V-like domains. The cytoplasmic tails of the B-G antigens are made up entirely of units of seven amino acid residues (heptads) that are typical of an alpha-helical coiled-coil conformation. The heptads vary in number and sequence between the different transcripts. The presence within B-G polypeptides of polymorphic immunoglobulin V-like domains warrants further investigations to determine the degree and nature of variability within this domain in these unusual MHC antigens.\r"

In this study, parameters are described for reproducible infection of SCID-hu mice after i.v. inoculation. Infection was found to be dependent upon the time after inoculation, the virus isolate, the titer of virus, and the human target organ implanted into the mouse. Ten to 14 days after the i.v. administration of HIV isolates derived freshly from patients (e.g., JR-CSF, JR-FL, SM), 100% of engrafted human lymph nodes in SCID-hu mice were infected; greater than 95% of these animals were also viremic. Implants of human thymus or connective tissue, as well as the endogenous murine hematolymphoid organs, were not infected. As demonstrated by a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, both T-lymphoid and myelomonocytic lineage cells were infected in this system. HIV isolates that have been adapted to growth in vitro (e.g., HTLV-IIIb) were not infectious. When either 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) or 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddIno) was administered to SCID-hu mice before HIV infection, the animals were protected in dose ranges similar to those used in man. This animal model may now be used as an efficient intermediate step between the lab and the clinic to study the infectious process in vivo and to best select efficacious antiviral compounds against HIV.\r"

The spoIIG operon from Bacillus subtilis is transcribed during sporulation by a form o RNA polymerase containing sigma A, the primary sigma factor in vegetative cells. The spoIIG promoter is unusual in that it contains sequences that are similar to those found at the -10 and -35 regions of promoters that are used by sigma A-associated RNA polymerase, but these sigma A-like recognition sequences are separated by 22 base pairs rather than the typical 17 or 18 base pairs. We found that single-base-pair substitutions in the around the -35-like sequence, and substitutions in a region upstream from this position, around position -87, reduced promoter activity. DNase I protection and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were used to demonstrate that Spo0A binds specifically to these regions in vitro. Evidently, the -35-like sequence is part of a Spo0A binding site and therefore is possibly not a sigma A-recognition sequence. These results support a model in which Spo0A activates the spoIIG promoter after the onset of endospore formation.\r"

Upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate plus anti-CD3 antibody, the great majority of TCCs specific for bacterial components was able to produce both IL-4 and IFN-gamma, whereas most D. pteronyssinus- and L. perenne group I-specific TCCs produced IL-4, but no, or limited, IFN-gamma. Moreover, the mean amounts of IL-4 and IFN-gamma released by allergen-specific TCCs were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than the mean amounts produced by TCCs specific for bacterial components. Under the same experimental conditions, virtually all allergen-specific TCCs, but only one-third of tested TCCs specific for bacterial components, expressed IL-5 RNA and secreted IL-5 in their supernatants. Eighteen TCCs (nine specific for allergens and nine specific for bacterial components) were also assessed for their ability to induce IgE synthesis by autologous B cells in response to stimulation with the specific antigen. Under these experimental conditions, all allergen-specific TCCs, but only one-third of TCCs specific for bacterial components that produced IL-4 but no, or little, IFN-gamma induced the synthesis of detectable amounts of IgE. The demonstration that most allergen-specific helper T cells in atopic individuals are able to produce high amounts of IL-4 (and IL-5), but no IFN-gamma, may explain why allergens induce production of IgE antibodies and increase eosinophils.\r"

In the cerebral extracts, we found altered phosphorylation of tau in heat-shocked females, characterized by a marked reduction in the amount of nonphosphorylated tau, a doubling of the ratio of total (phosphorylated plus nonphosphorylated) tau to nonphosphorylated tau, and the appearance of the slowest moving phosphorylated tau polypeptide (68 kDa). Similar, but milder, changes were observed in male rats. These changes progressively increased in females from 3 to 6 h after heat shocking. In contrast, both phosphorylated tau and nonphosphorylated tau were reduced in peripheral nerves after heat shocking. In immunoblots of SDS extracts from Alzheimer disease-affected brain, the two slowest moving phosphorylated tau polypeptides (62 kDa and 66 kDa, respectively) were detected by Tau-1 after dephosphorylation and by Tau-2 (an anti-tau-monoclonal antibody that recognizes a phosphate-independent epitope) without prior dephosphorylation only in regions that contained tau immunoreactivity in histologic preparations. In addition, quantitative immunoblot analysis of cortex and the underlying white matter with Tau-1 and 125I-labeled protein A showed that the amount of phosphorylated tau progressively increased in the Alzheimer disease-affected cerebral cortex, while concurrently a proportionally lesser amount of tau entered the white matter axons. The similar findings for the rat heat-shock model and Alzheimer disease suggest that life stressors may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer disease.\r"

  ".W": "Variations in the absorption spectra of cone photopigments over the spectral range of about 530 to 562 nanometers are a principal cause of individual differences in human color vision and of differences in color vision within and across other primates. To study the molecular basis of these variations, nucleotide sequences were determined for eight primate photopigment genes. The spectral peaks of the pigments specified by these genes spanned the range from 530 to 562 nanometers. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of these eight pigments suggest that three amino acid substitutions produce the approximately 30-nanometer difference in spectral peaks of the pigments underlying human red-green color vision, and red shifts of specific magnitudes are produced by replacement of nonpolar with hydroxyl-bearing amino acids at each of the three critical positions.\r"

The sudden onset of back pain and neurologic deficits should alert the clinician to the possibility of spinal hematoma with cord compression.\r"

This therapy can be useful in selected patients, preserving fertility by delaying the need for imminent surgical treatment. In selected perimenopausal women, agonist therapy may, in fact, be an alternative to surgical intervention. Shrinking the size of myomas and reducing uterine volume with these agents have been reported to control symptoms of myoma, making myomectomy or vaginal hysterectomy a safer procedure. Used preoperatively, GnRH-A therapy can also reduce the risk of surgical complications and excessive blood loss.\r"

Both UK and pro-UK inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), collagen, or thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, although a low dose of rt-PA (5 to 10 x 10(4) U/ml) blunted platelet aggregability, a high dose (40 to 60 x 10(4) U/ml) led to platelet hyperaggregation. UK and pro-UK markedly inhibited TXA2 synthesis during ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Despite the significant reduction of TXA2 synthesis by 10 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA, a concentration of 60 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA had no effect on synthesis. These results indicate that UK and pro-UK each inhibit platelet function, but a high concentration of rt-PA enhances platelet aggregability. This finding may at least in part contribute to the high incidence of reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with rt-PA.\r"

Seven swine were initially (CON) evaluated by echocardiography and then by right heart catheterization and provocative electrical ventricular stimulation both before and after treatment with intravenous flecainide. Rapid atrial pacing at 210 to 240 beats/min (SVT) was then employed for 2 to 4 weeks until echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction developed. Immediately upon termination of pacing, the above studies were repeated both before and after treatment with flecainide. Significant (p less than 0.0001) pacing-related hemodynamic effects on the cardiac output (CON:3.0 L/min versus SVT:1.6 L/min), right ventricular ejection fraction (CON:55% versus SVT:17%), and pulmonary wedge pressure (CON:8 mm Hg versus SVT:22 mm Hg) were observed. Pacing-related electrophysiologic effects included increases in the PR interval (CON:94 msec versus SVT:119 msec, p less than 0.001) and QTc interval (CON:418 msec versus SVT:450 msec, p = 0.016). With serum flecainide concentrations in the human therapeutic range, no significant effect on hemodynamic or electrophysiologic parameters in either the normal or failing heart were detected. Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia induced prior to pacing in one animal and after pacing in another animal was seen before but not following use of flecainide. No acute proarrhythmic effects were observed. In summary, intravenous flecainide had no significant acute adverse hemodynamic, electrophysiologic, or proarrhythmic effects in an animal model of tachycardia-induced ventricular dysfunction.\r"

The study included 31 subjects, divided into three groups: controls, Chagas' 1 (subjects with only positive serology for Chagas' disease) and Chagas' 2 (subjects with positive serology and electrocardiographic abnormalities that are usually found in this disease). The subjects were studied during rest, while standing, and during handgrip exercise. With this approach, the low frequency (approximately 0.1 Hz) spectral component of R-R interval variability is considered to be a marker primarily of sympathetic activity, whereas the high frequency (approximately 0.25 Hz) component, which is related to respiration, seems mainly to reflect vagal activity. We observed significant (p less than 0.05) differences among the three groups during standing: although in the control subjects the low-frequency component increased (delta = 30 +/- 5 normalized units, nu), there was no increase in Chagas' 1 (delta = -1 +/- 8 nu) and Chagas' 2 (delta = -2 +/- 8 nu) patients. During handgrip exercise, another test that is capable of exciting sympathetic outflow, there was an increase of low frequency only in control subjects. These results confirm the occurrence of quantitative and assessable abnormalities in the neural control of heart rate variability in Argentinian patients with chronic Chagas' disease, even in the absence of heart failure.\r"

Hemodynamic parameters, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and atrial natriuretic factor were assessed. Control ergometry revealed ischemia; however, during exercise with intravenous milrinone, ischemia was eliminated. Because of unloading effects, there was also a significant decrease in ST segment depression (p less than 0.001). Heart rate increased significantly (p less than 0.001) at rest but increased significantly less after exercise testing (p less than 0.001). The changes in mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and myocardial oxygen consumption during exercise were not significantly different between the milrinone and control phase. Intravenous milrinone delayed the onset of angina (p less than 0.001) and significantly shortened the duration of anginal attacks (p less than 0.05); exercise duration in the milrinone phase was longer than in the control phase (p = 0.051). Because of vasodilatation, a mild secondary increase in norepinephrine was observed during the milrinone phase, and there was a significantly smaller increase in atrial natriuretic factor during exercise while receiving milrinone as a result of preload reduction (p less than 0.05). Intravenous milrinone produced beneficial hemodynamic and antiischemic effects in patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina, and reproducible ST segment depression probably by enhancing myocardial contractility and reducing preload and afterload.\r"

In this study, Lp(a) serum levels were determined by radioimmunoassay in 124 patients with ischemic heart disease. Of these, 47 had acute myocardial infarction, 13 had unstable angina, and 64 were age-matched patients with stable angina. Of the 60 patients with acute coronary artery disease, 34 received thrombolysis and 26 did not. In addition to Lp(a), serum plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer (cross-linked fibrin degradation products) levels were measured. These tests were repeated after 6 hours in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina. No significant difference was found for admission Lp(a) levels among patients with myocardial infarction (0.324 +/- 0.047 g/liter), unstable angina (0.435 +/- 0.123 g/liter) and stable angina (0.431 +/- 0.023 g/liter), between patients with myocardial infarction with or without thrombolytic treatment, nor between late and early measurements in patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction. Plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin and fibrinogen values decreased significantly after thrombolytic treatment. The size of this decrease correlated positively with higher Lp(a) blood levels (p less than 0.05). Patients with Lp(a) greater than 0.25 g/liter had a 66% decrease in fibrinogen and a 53% decrease in anti-plasmin, compared with 35 and 32%, respectively, in patients with Lp(a) level less than or equal to 0.25 g/liter (p less than 0.05). Plasminogen levels revealed a similar trend, with a 61% decrease for the higher values and a 45% decrease for the lower values.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Because subjects were standing during the procedure a small amount of heat was conducted through the feet; this heat was ignored. Total heat loss measured by IRT was not significantly different from values calculated from simultaneous indirect calorimetry (IC) determinations in fasting health subjects and in postsurgical patients receiving a constant infusion of energy. In healthy subjects, after eating the patterns of response to IRT and IC were as predicted from previous direct calorimetry data. Heat loss measured by IC increased first, 30 min postprandially, followed by an increase in heat loss at 60 min as measured by IRT. It was concluded that IRT as a noninvasive method can be used to quantitate heat loss in human beings.\r"

Despite low intake of 9c-16:1, 11c-18:1, and 13c-18:1, adipose-tissue concentrations of these monounsaturated fatty acids were higher in the TPN patients than in free-living control subjects (P less than 0.05) and inversely correlated with the percent energy from fat (r = -0.56, P = 0.11; r = -0.64, P = 0.06; r = -0.81, P = 0.008, respectively). This suggests that these fatty acids accumulated from endogenous synthesis from carbohydrate and thus may be markers of the percent fat in the diet. The essential fatty acids, 18:2 and 18:3n-3, positively correlated with the percent energy from fat (r = 0.79, P = 0.01; r = 0.80, P = 0.01, respectively). Linear-regression analysis suggests that normal adipose-tissue stores of 18:2 and 18:3n-3 are maintained when intravenous soybean-oil emulsion provides 11-20% and 4-12%, respectively, of total energy.\r"

Catheter-related sepsis occurred in 5% of infants with umbilical arterial catheters and in 3% of infants with umbilical venous catheters. Staphylococcal species accounted for 71% of cases of catheter-related sepsis. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that very low birth weight and longer duration of antibiotic therapy were significantly associated with risk for umbilical arterial catheter-related sepsis. Increased risk for umbilical venous catheter-related sepsis was best predicted by the simultaneous occurrence of higher birth weight and infusion of hyperalimentation solution. Catheter duration correlated with duration of antibiotic therapy and with infusion of hyperalimentation solution for both types of catheters; however, in the multivariable analysis, duration of catheterization was not found to be a significant independent predictor of risk for catheter-related sepsis for either type of catheter.\r"

Accordingly, a wide range of clinical manifestations are produced by the various mutations occurring in human populations. In this study, we analyze the subunit structure of complex I in fibroblasts from two patients who have distinct clinical phenotypes associated with complex I deficiency. The first patient died in the second week of life from overwhelming lactic acidosis. Severe complex I deficiency was evident in her fibroblasts, since alanine oxidation was markedly reduced whereas succinate oxidation was normal. Absence of a 20-kDa subunit was demonstrable when newly synthesized proteins were immunoprecipitated from pulse-labeled fibroblasts by anti-complex I antibody. Disordered assembly or decreased stability of the complex was suggested by deficiency of multiple subunits on Western immunoblots. The second patient exhibited a milder clinical phenotype, characterized by moderate lactic acidosis and developmental delay in childhood and by onset of seizures at 8 years of age. Oxidation studies demonstrated expression of the complex I deficiency in fibroblasts, but no subunit abnormalities were detected by immunoprecipitation or Western immunoblotting. This report demonstrates the utility of cultured fibroblasts in studying mutations affecting synthesis and assembly of complex I.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified three different tyrosinase gene mutant alleles in four unrelated patients with type IB (\"yellow\") oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and thus have demonstrated that type IB OCA is allelic to type IA (tyrosinase negative) OCA. In an inbred Amish kindred, type IB OCA results from homozygosity for a Pro----Leu substitution at codon 406. In the second family, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for a type IA OCA allele (codon 81 Pro----Leu) and a novel type IB allele (codon 275 Val----Phe). In the third patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the same type IB allele (codon 275 Val----Phe) and a novel type IB OCA allele. In a fourth patient, type IB OCA results from compound heterozygosity for the codon 81 type IA OCA allele and a type IB allele that contains no identifiable abnormalities; dysfunction of this type IB allele apparently results from a mutation either well within one of the large introns or at some distance from the tyrosinase gene. In vitro expression of the Amish type IB allele in nonpigmented HeLa cells demonstrates that the Pro----Leu substitution at codon 406 greatly reduces but does not abolish tyrosinase enzymatic activity, a finding consistent with the clinical phenotype.\r"

  ".W": "Sixty-six patients with fibrocystic mastopathy were enrolled in the trial after being selected according to clinical, radioultrasonographic, and histologic criteria. No characteristic hormonal profile was noted in most patients (52%). Estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors, or both, were found in 57% of patients. Hormone receptor levels were correlated with atypical proliferative mastopathy (87.5%). Mastopathy was associated with a uterine fibroma or a fibromatous uterus in 73% of cases. All patients received intramuscular injections of a sustained delivery system (microcapsules) of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist [D-Trp6]-LHRH, Ipsen-Biotech, Paris) for 3 to 6 months. In case of partial response at 3 months, an antiestrogen (tamoxifen, 40 mg/day, for estrogen receptor-predominant lesions) or a progestin (cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/day, for progesterone receptor-predominant lesions) was added to the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist. A complete response was observed in more than half of the patients (n = 35, 53%) treated by [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone (n = 29) or associated with tamoxifen (n = 4) or cyproterone acetate (n = 2). A significant partial response was observed in 30 other patients (45%). Additionally, half of them received inhibitory drugs. The best responses were seen with cyst reformation (complete response, 100%) and fibrous block. Clinical responses to treatment with [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone were independent of hormone receptor status, but synergistic effects occurred with concomitant use of the corresponding inhibitory drugs. We conclude that chronic mastopathy, particularly when associated with uterine fibroma, can be successfully treated by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogs in premenopausal women.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of preeclampsia on the circulating concentrations of the 28-amino-acid carboxy terminus (C-terminus) (i.e., atrial natriuretic factor) and the amino terminus (N-terminus) of the 126-amino-acid atrial natriuretic factor prohormone (pro ANF) was studied in the third trimester with the use of three specific radioimmunoassays that recognize: (1) atrial natriuretic factor (i.e., amino acids 99 to 126), (2) the whole 98-amino-acid N-terminus, and (3) amino acids 31 to 67 from the midportion of the N-terminus of the prohormone. The C-terminus was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in the third trimester in women with preeclampsia, the mean +/- SEM of 15 subjects was 150 +/- 7 pg/ml versus 89 +/- 7 pg/ml in the third trimester in 12 women during normal pregnancies and 65 +/- 2 pg/ml in 19 healthy nonpregnant women. The whole 98-amino-acid N-terminus, likewise, was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in women with preeclampsia to 4706 +/- 629 pg/ml versus 2160 +/- 79 pg/ml in women in the third trimester of normal pregnancies and versus the circulating concentration of 1847 +/- 127 pg/ml in healthy nonpregnant women. ProANF 31 to 67 mean circulating concentration in preeclampsia was 4638 +/- 725 pg/ml, which was also significantly (p less than 0.001) increased compared with its mean circulating concentration in the third trimester of normal pregnancy of 1758 +/- 83 pg/ml or that in healthy nonpregnant women (1400 +/- 105 pg/ml). The circulating concentrations of both the N-terminus and C-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone decreased within 24 hours after delivery in contrast to a normal pregnancy in which they both increase post partum. These results indicate a marked difference in the metabolism of both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the atrial natriuretic factor prohormone in women with preeclampsia versus that in women with normal pregnancies or that in healthy nonpregnant women.\r"

  ".W": "Gestation is longer in Faroese than Danish women, possibly because of the high intake of marine long-chain n-3 fatty acids that down regulates formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were quantified in erythrocytes obtained within 2 days of delivery from randomly selected groups of 62 Faroese and 37 Danish women with an assessable gestational age. Average ratio of long-chain n-3 fatty acids to arachidonic acid [(3/6) ratio] was 0.73 (SD = 0.11) in Faroese women and 0.61 (SD = 0.12) in Danish women (p less than 0.0001), corresponding to the higher intake of marine n-3 fatty acids in the Faroes. A 20% increase in the (3/6) ratio was associated with an increase in pregnancy duration of 5.7 days in Danish women (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 10.1 days; p = 0.02) and 0.7 days in Faroese women (95% confidence interval, -2.0 to 3.3; p = 0.6). The hypothesized exposure-effect relationship may be weaker or absent at the higher level of exposure seen in the Faroese group.\r"
