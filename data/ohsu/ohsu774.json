  ".W": "Forty-one children with refractory acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) were treated from March 1975 to February 1979 with a schedule-dependent combination of methotrexate (MTX) and L-asparaginase. Intravenous (IV) MTX was followed 24 hours later by IV L-asparaginase (10,000 units [U]/m2). The MTX dose was started at 60 to 100 mg/m2 and was escalated by 20 to 40 mg/m2 as tolerated. This sequence was repeated every 7 to 10 days. Eight patients (20%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and six others had a partial response (PR), with clearance of blasts from the peripheral blood and reduction of bone marrow blasts to less than 25% of nucleated marrow cells. Responding patients received a median maximum MTX dose of 120 mg/m2 (range, 60 to 220 mg/m2). The median number of courses required to achieve a CR was 6 (range, 2 to 13 courses). Toxicity consisted of allergic reactions to L-asparaginase (n = 12), stomatitis (n = 6), minimal elevation of hepatic enzymes (n = 2), and hyperglycemia (n = 1). Treatment was given on an outpatient basis in 95% of all courses. The data indicate that this combination therapy has antileukemic activity and is relatively nontoxic in childhood ANLL.\r"

The authors' goal was to treat patients with continuous infusion mitoxantrone in order to maintain cytotoxic steady state levels with acceptable toxicity and to assess the results. Daily mitoxantrone levels showed a mean steady state plasma level of 16.8 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (range, 9.1-25.1) with a systemic clearance of 519 +/- 47 ml/minute/m2. No drug accumulation occurred. Mitoxantrone was undetectable 24 hours postinfusion. All patients, including two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast phase, had greater than 90% reduction in leukemia cell mass (marrow cellularity X percent leukemia cells) by day 6. However, six patients received 3 days of etoposide at that point because of residual acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Overall four patients (36%) had a complete remission; one additional patient had a bone marrow remission but also had a persistent granulocytic sarcoma. Toxicities included severe but tolerable myelosuppression, mucositis, and hepatic dysfunction. There was no correlation between mitoxantrone levels, toxicity, or clinical response. Continuous infusion produces cytotoxic plasma mitoxantrone levels and rapid clearing of ANLL from bone marrow. Further dose escalation may be possible.\r"

Twenty-four patients had either refractory or relapsed primary ANLL, and 17 had ANLL secondary to prior cytotoxic chemotherapy or an underlying hematologic disorder. The overall complete remission (CR) rate was 37%. The CR rates for primary and secondary ANLL were almost identical. Furthermore, advanced age alone did not adversely influence the CR rate. The median CR duration was 302 days with no differences between primary and secondary ANLL. The induction death rate was 24%. Predictors for induction deaths included poor initial performance status, fever at the time of presentation, low cholesterol and/or albumin, and an initial bone marrow aspirate with greater than 50% blasts. These data indicate that HiDAC-ASNase is a moderately effective regimen for patients with poor prognosis ANLL including secondary ANLL.\r"

Electrophysiologic recordings were performed before and after the completion of three courses of chemotherapy (cisplatin total dose: 250-300 mg/m2). The comparison between the recordings showed 14% of the patients had an increase in the latency of the soleus muscle monosynaptic reflex as studied by the Hoffman reflex and 9% showed a decrease in the conduction velocity of the cutaneous sensory fibers of the median nerve. These results indicated a low prevalence of cisplatin-induced neuropathy. The respective roles played by the continuous infusion of the drug and by the potentiation of neurotoxic effects resulting from the association of cisplatin with other neurotoxins is discussed to explain this low toxicity.\r"

Current therapy includes wide local excision and high-dose postoperative radiation therapy (XRT) (5400 to 7000 cGy). Despite early aggressive treatment, local recurrence remains a major problem with limited safe and effective therapeutic options available. The excellent local responses obtained in four patients (six sites) with ACC of the head and neck treated either with additional low-dose irradiation (2160 to 3420 cGy) in conjunction with two to five hyperthermia (HT) treatments or with full dose XRT and HT as part of the overall treatment plan are reported. All HT treatments were for 45 minutes once steady state conditions were obtained. Monitored intratumoral temperatures for all treatments achieved average maximum (Tmax), average mean (Tave), and average minimum (Tmin) temperatures of 44.2 degrees C, 41.2 degrees C, and 38.9 degrees C, respectively. A complete response was obtained for all six fields with no significant long-term complications. Two patients remain alive and free of local disease at 42 and 63 months of follow-up. Two patients died--one with metastases (with persistent local control) and one with a local recurrence at 9 and 30 months, respectively, after XRT and HT. This is the first report of HT and low-dose XRT in the management of previously irradiated ACC and suggests a potential role for the use of this modality in the treatment of ACC.\r"

Seventy percent of patients undergoing enucleation and 42.9% undergoing partial nephrectomy survived with a mean follow-up period of 5 years. Survival or local recurrence rate after enucleative surgery is an effective treatment of renal carcinoma in selected patients, and despite concerns about tumor invasion of the pseudocapsule, the clinical data do not indicate any difference in survival. There was no significant difference between enucleation of tumor and partial nephrectomy regarding morbidity, mortality, or recurrence rate.\r"

Over a 3-year period, 20 giant cell tumors from 14 different patients were cytogenetically characterized. Random chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 14 of the 20 specimens and clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in six. An unusual anomaly, telomeric fusion, was the most striking random chromosomal abnormality detected. A comparison of the presence or absence of cytogenetic aberrations and the clinical behavior of these neoplasms was studied as well as a comparison of the aberrations in the initial specimen with those in subsequent specimens. Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in all but one of the ten tumors shown to be locally aggressive, recurrent, or metastatic. (The abnormalities observed in five of these tumors were clonal). There were no chromosomal abnormalities present in three of four tumors that behaved in an innocent fashion. These findings support the presence of chromosomal abnormalities in giant cell tumors (telomeric fusion in particular) and suggest that cytogenetic analysis may be useful in predicting the biologic behavior of these neoplasms.\r"

Approximately 50% of patients were found still to be estrogen receptor positive at relapse from first-line hormone treatment. Progesterone receptor had, however, usually become negative. Nine of the 22 patients responded to second-line hormonal therapy. Second hormone responses occurred with equal frequency among hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative patients. Tumor ploidy, as determined by flow cytometric study did, however, predict for response. Eight of 12 patients with diploid tumors responded to second-line hormone therapy whereas only one of ten with aneuploid tumors responded. Flow cytometric analysis appears to be a promising technique for prediction of second hormone response after relapse from first-line hormone manipulation.\r"

Features of the grading such as nuclear pleomorphism proved to correlate closely with the proliferative activity and aggressiveness of the tumors. Because of difficulties in assessing and classifying the degree of nuclear pleomorphism by usual microscopy, the authors applied methods of digital image analysis. The study is a retrospective analysis of paraffine slides from the primary lesions of 60 breast cancers with 10 to 16 years of follow-up evaluation. Using large sets of different parameters defining nuclear morphology and chromatin structure the authors extracted criteria with prognostic importance. These included nuclear area in micron 2, eccentricity, integral optical density per micron 2, average area of a chromatin region, integral optical density of a chromatin region per micron 2, and the number of central chromatin regions per micron 2. The results demonstrate that the criteria used enable prediction of prognosis with an accuracy of 92%.\r"

Of the 37 patients with dysplasia, 28 were re-evaluated prospectively at 6-month intervals for up to 36 months by balloon-mesh cytology, esophagoscopy with vital staining and biopsies, chest radiographs, oropharyngeal examination, and indirect laryngoscopy. During prospective follow-up evaluation, cytology specimens were repetitively normal in 16 patients (57%), showed inflammatory changes in eight patients (29%), persisted as dysplasia in two patients (7%) (both had endoscopic and histologic evidence of esophagitis), and progressed to carcinoma in two patients (7%) (one esophageal, one laryngeal). Although histologic findings concurred with the resolution of dysplasia, biopsy specimens were characterized by a similar difficulty in distinguishing dysplasia from inflammation. Erroneous histologic diagnoses of carcinoma in situ were made in two patients with reflux esophagitis evident endoscopically and confirmed during the course of a 24-36 month follow-up period. The authors conclude that squamous cell dysplasia detected by balloon-mesh cytology is seldom a precursor of esophageal cancer in the high-risk U.S. population but, rather, is often related to esophagitis. Thus, balloon-mesh cytology has limited use as a screening method for the early detection of esophageal cancer in the United States.\r"

  ".W": "A case of primary tumor of the liver with pathologic features strikingly similar to those of the papillary cystic tumor of the pancreas in a 41-year-old woman is presented. Two large, well-demarcated, solid and cystic tumors with extensive hemorrhage and necrosis were located in the right and left lobes, measuring 30 x 27 x 7.5 cm and 5.5 x 4.0 x 2.5 cm, respectively. Microscopically, both tumor masses showed two basic patterns of cellular arrangement. One was a papillary pattern with fairly prominent fibrovascular stalks covered with one to three cell layers of tall to cuboidal cells. The other pattern was that of solid growth with microcystic degeneration. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells were polyhedral and their oval shaped nuclei were occasionally indented. The cytoplasmic organelles varied in amount, and immature cell junctions and intercellular spaces were rarely present. A few cells contained zymogen-like secretory granules and annulate lamellae. The pancreas was free of tumor. To our knowledge, this tumor is a unique clinicopathologic entity of hepatic origin, and its similarity to the pancreatic papillary cystic tumor in clinical, gross, microscopic, and ultrastructural features together with their closely related organogenesis, suggests that this tumor derives from pluripotential cells transdifferentiating toward the pancreatic acinar cells and ductular cells, with the latter being indistinguishable from intrahepatic small bile ductular epithelial cells.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical records and histopathologic features in 26 cases of extraskeletal osteosarcoma (ESOS) diagnosed at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston) between 1950 and 1987 were reviewed. Presentation was usually that of an enlarging soft tissue mass. The thigh (11 cases), upper extremity/shoulder girdle (three cases), and retroperitoneum (three cases) were the most common anatomic sites. Tumor size ranged from 2.5 to 30 cm. The predominant histologic pattern was osteoblastic in four cases, chondroblastic in two, fibroblastic or pleomorphic malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH)-like in four, giant cell type MFH-like in one, and small cell in one. Various mixtures of these patterns were seen in the remaining 14 tumors. The telangiectatic pattern was not seen as the predominant component in any primary tumor but was observed as a minor component. Thirteen tumors recurred locally and 16 metastasized; five patients had distant metastases at presentation. The lungs, bone, and soft tissue were the most frequent metastatic sites. Sixteen patients died of disease at 2 to 54 months, one patient died of unrelated causes at 61 months, seven patients were alive with no evidence of disease (NED) at 30 to 122 months, and two patients were alive with disease at 28 and 54 months, respectively. Tumor size (less than 5 cm versus greater than or equal to 5 cm) was the main prognostic factor; all patients alive with NED for whom accurate tumor measurements were available (six of seven) had neoplasms measuring less than 5 cm that were amenable to complete surgical excision. Histologic pattern and other clinicopathologic features did not significantly affect outcome.\r"

  ".W": "Between 1957 and 1980, 54 children less than 20 years of age with a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme or malignant astrocytoma were treated. All patients had a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. Twenty-seven patients had glioblastoma multiforme and 27 had malignant astrocytoma. The median age was 8 years for glioblastoma multiforme patients and 10 years for malignant astrocytoma patients. All patients received radiation therapy, but two died of postoperative complications and did not complete the treatment. The Kernohan Grading System was more useful in distinguishing glioblastoma multiforme and malignant astrocytoma in terms of prognosis than was the Nelson criterion of tumor necrosis. Glioblastoma multiforme (IV) patients had survivals of 44% at 1 year, 26% at 2 years, 4% at 5 years, and 0% at 10 years. Malignant astrocytoma (III) patients had 74% survival at 1 year, 56% at 2 years, 36% at 5 years, and 32% at 10 years, (all P less than 0.05). The tumor dose and tumor location affected survival significantly. Patients with hemispheric malignant astrocytoma who received 54-60 Gy had a 60% 5-year survival rate compared to 14% for doses of 35-50 Gy. Glioblastoma multiforme patients with noncentral tumors had a 9% 5- year survival with 54-60 Gy versus 0% with 35-50 Gy. Cerebral and cerebellar hemispheric tumors did better than central tumors. There were no 5-year survivors among patients with central tumors. Noncentral tumors, on the other hand, resulted in a 44% 5-year survival for malignant astrocytoma and 5% for glioblastoma multiforme. Radiation therapy was well tolerated during the acute period. Only one patient developed a late neurologic deficit attributable to therapy. The patient had hearing loss after two courses of 50 Gy each to a temporal lobe tumor. However, six of the 11 patients who survived for 5 years or longer had intellectual, emotional, or endocrine dysfunction.\r"

The average annual age-adjusted incidence rate was 12.9/100,000 for men and 2.9/100,000 for women (1970 US standard million population). The male age-adjusted incidence rate decreased 33% from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. The female age-adjusted incidence rate exhibited a threefold steady increase over this same time period. The male/female ratio for oral cancer incidence declined dramatically from 10.4 to 2.7 for the age-adjusted rate, nearly a fourfold decrease during the 51- year period. Birth cohort analyses for women indicated a marked increase in oral cancer incidence for the birth cohort of 1900, which was sustained in the birth cohorts that followed. Birth cohort analyses for men revealed a decline in oral cancer incidence for birth cohorts born after 1910. The highest incidence rates were found in the urban counties and the lowest in the rural areas.\r"

  ".W": "To establish the relationship between ultraviolet-B radiation and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and actinic keratosis (AK), a cross-sectional prevalence survey was performed in a sample of 808 white, male watermen 30 years of age and older residing in the Eastern Shore of Maryland. A measure of personal cumulative ultraviolet-B exposure was determined for each subject from data collected through interviews and field and laboratory measurements. A personal interview elicited skin type, medication history, and other factors. Clinical diagnoses and histologic confirmation were done for current and previously removed skin tumors. The ratio of subjects with SCC to subjects with BCC was approximately 1:1; however, the ratio of BCC to SCC was 1.25:1 because BCC cases were more prone to multiple lesions. Watermen with SCC or AK but not BCC had higher average annual ultraviolet-B doses than age-matched controls. This was particularly marked in watermen younger than 60 years of age. Logistic regression showed that an older age, childhood freckling, and blue eyes significantly increased the risk of the development of all three types of skin tumor. Ease of sunburning was associated with BCC and AK, but not with SCC. Watermen in the upper quartile of cumulative ultraviolet-B exposure had a 2.5 times higher risk for the development of SCC when compared with the lower 3 quartiles. This suggests that high levels of ultraviolet-B exposure are important in SCC occurrence. The risk of AK developing was 1.5 times higher for those whose cumulative ultraviolet-B exposure exceeded the median. The relationship of BCC to cumulative ultraviolet-B exposure was not clear and this suggests that different etiologic mechanisms operate for SCC and BCC.\r"

Tetanic fade was detected reliably by clinical evaluation only when high degrees of fade (tetanic fade ratio of 0.3 or less) were detected with a force-displacement transducer. We conclude that the clinical tactile assessment of the response to tetanic stimulation is not accurate except at very high degrees of fade and that its usefulness in monitoring neuromuscular recovery is doubtful.\r"

Therefore they were the subject of a retrospective review which looked at the longitudinal trend of plasma potassium concentration [K+] during surgery. Ten of eleven children had a statistically significant increase in plasma potassium concentration during their intraoperative course and in five the potassium concentration exceeded 5.5 mmol.L-1. This was in contrast to the stable intraoperative plasma [K+] observed in a control group which did not receive blood transfusion. All MCFS children received a blood transfusion with red blood cell concentrates (RBCconc). The age of the units of RBCconc which had been transfused was 16.1 +/- 8.4 days. The amount of extracellular potassium in 28 units of RBCconc was determined in order to estimate the amount of free potassium (Kdose) which the MCFS group received. The plasma [K+] in units of RBCconc less than 1 week of age was less than 20 mmol.L-1, whereas in units aged greater than 2 weeks it was greater than 40 mmol.L-1. The estimated Kdose was 0.2-1.6 mmol.kg-1. We concluded that the amount of extracellular potassium in units of RBCconc was clinically important and may give rise to hyperkalaemia during massive blood transfusion.\r"

Haemodynamic profiles were obtained prior to anaesthesia and at several times during surgery. The haemodynamic courses in both groups were similar with significant decreases in cardiac index, stroke index, and left ventricular stroke work index during aortic cross-clamping compared with values prior to anaesthesia. There were no significant changes in PCWP and CVP throughout the study. The correlations between PCWP and CVP were significant in both groups as were the correlations between the changes in PCWP and the changes in CVP observed at the time of cross-clamping. These correlations all had large standard errors of the estimate, however, making it impossible to predict the PCWP from the CVP with precision. It is concluded that, in a limited study population, an abnormal DTS did not identify patients in whom the PCWP and CVP correlated poorly during abdominal aortic aneurysmectomy.\r"

Ten patients (Group A) received midazolam (0.07 mg.kg-1), fentanyl (1 microgram.kg-1), propofol (2 mg.kg-1) and succinylcholine (1 mg.kg-1). Following tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained with propofol (6 mg.kg-1.hr-1), N2O (67 per cent) and O2 (33 per cent). In nine patients (Group B) thiopentone (4 mg.kg-1) was substituted for propofol and anaesthesia maintained with N2O (67 per cent) O2 (33 per cent), and enflurane (0.5 per cent inspired concentration). The study was non-randomised because Group B patients were only included if HR before administration of atropine less than 90 beats.min-1. IPPV was performed in all patients using a Manley ventilator (minute vol. 85 ml.kg-1; tidal vol. 7 ml.kg-1). Ten minutes after tracheal intubation, incremental doses of atropine (equivalent cumulative doses: 1.8, 3.6, 7.2, 14.4, 28.8 micrograms.kg-1) were administered at two-minute intervals and HR responses calculated during the last 45 sec of each intervening period. No differences were observed between the groups following 1.8 and 3.6 micrograms.kg-1 atropine, but propofol-N2O anaesthesia was associated with reduced responses (P less than 0.01) following 7.2, 14.4 and 28.8 micrograms.kg-1 atropine. These results suggest that there is a predominance of parasympathetic influences during propofol-N2O anaesthesia compared with thiopentone-enflurane-N2O anaesthesia.\r"

Our data show that only in Group I patients who did not receive histamine receptor blockers, were there significant haemodynamic changes following protamine administration (P less than 0.05).

Forty ASA physical status I or II children ages 18 mo to 11 yr were randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 patients received a caudal block with 0.5 ml.kg-1 of bupivacaine 0.25 per cent following the induction of anaesthesia but before the onset of surgery. Group 2 patients received a similar block at the completion of surgery but before emergence from general anaesthesia. An experienced observer, who was not aware of the timing of block placement, observed all patients from arrival to the post-anaesthetic recovery room until discharge from the ambulatory surgery unit. Pain was assessed at five-minute intervals using an Objective Pain Scale. No statistically significant differences were noted between Group 1 and Group 2 patients with regard to their postoperative pain/discomfort scores, the need for postoperative narcotic analgesia, or the time required for either group to meet standard discharge criteria. It is concluded that the duration of postoperative analgesia is not impaired by placing the caudal block prior to the start of a brief surgical procedure.\r"

Lidocaine did not attenuate the increases in heart rate and arterial blood pressure. The pressor response was significantly affected by baseline haemodynamic values, P less than 0.05. The increases in systolic and mean blood pressure were significantly affected by the age of the patient, P less than 0.05. Lidocaine is not a beneficial adjunct to induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone in healthy children for the purpose of attenuating the pressor response to intubation.\r"

Anxiety was found to be higher in females and those not having had a previous anaesthetic, and to remain constant from the afternoon before surgery to the immediate preoperative period.

In the etomidate group, etomidate 0.3 mg.kg-1 was given as a bolus injection during induction of anaesthesia which was followed by an infusion of etomidate 0.05 mg.kg-1.min-1. No significant changes were observed in the amplitudes of P100 or N70. Latencies of the P60, N70, and P100 were slightly increased. In the fentanyl-N2O-etomidate group, a bolus injection of 0.3 mg.kg-1 of etomidate was given during anaesthesia with 3-4 micrograms.kg-1 of fentanyl and 60 per cent nitrous oxide. The amplitude of the P100 was significantly decreased and the latencies of the P60 and N70 were significantly increased. In conclusion, interpretation of the VEP during etomidate administration alone was not hard to perform but, when given together with fentanyl-nitrous oxide anaesthesia, the VEP was affected significantly making its interpretation difficult.\r"

  ".W": "The aim of the present study was to examine whether changes in temperature alter the effects of halothane and isoflurane on isolated left atria. Concentration-response curves for inotropic effects at different temperatures (30 degrees C, 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C) on electrically stimulated left atria of the rat were obtained. The change of temperature modified the maximal negative inotropic response to halothane. The maximal decrease induced by halothane was 12 +/- 2.3 per cent at 37 degrees C and 18 +/- 2.5 per cent at 30 degrees C. When the temperature increased up to 40 degrees C the maximal decrease of atrial inotropism was 46 +/- 2.1 per cent--significantly higher than obtained at 37 degrees C. However, the maximal effect obtained by isoflurane was not significantly affected by temperature (30 degrees C = 7 +/- 1.6 per cent; 37 degrees C = 8 +/- 1.8 per cent; 40 degrees C = 2 +/- 0.8 per cent). Furthermore the potency of halothane (expressed as the concentration which produced 50 per cent inhibition - IC 50 per cent), decreased significantly at 30 degrees C (IC 50 = 1.34 +/- 0.18) and increased at 40 degrees C (IC 50 = 0.44 +/- 0.17) when compared with its potency at 37 degrees C (IC 50 = 0.96 +/- 0.08). On the other hand changes in temperature did not significantly modify the IC 50 for isoflurane obtained at 37 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

The incidence of positive lumbar punctures increased with patient age. Younger infants did not present with classical features of meningitis. Bulging fontanel, lethargy, and irritability were nonspecific symptoms. Vomiting and headache, although not specific, proved to be more sensitive indicators of meningeal infection. Most patients with meningitis (75%) had at least one sign of meningeal irritation, but so did 25% of patients without meningitis. Brudzinski's sign was not specific. In contrast, nuchal rigidity and Kernig's sign had high predictive value. Up to age five, the diseases most often suggesting meningitis were right-sided pneumonia, gastroenteritis, otitis, tonsillitis, exanthema subitum, and urinary tract infections. Of 171 patients with febrile convulsion, one (0.5%) had bacterial meningitis and four had aseptic meningitis.\r"

Agreement between the two methods was measured by the intraclass correlation, whereas the linear relationship was assessed by the product-moment correlation. The intraclass correlations for systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures were 0.696, 0.766, and 0.781, respectively. The product-moment correlations for systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressures were 0.706, 0.768, and 0.786, respectively. BP measurements by the Dinamap monitor showed reasonably close agreement to those obtained by the intraarterial mean arterial pressure ranges above 40 mmHg. For mean arterial pressure of 40 mmHg and lower, BP readings by the Dinamap monitor tended to be higher than those obtained by the intraarterial method. These findings appeared to be consistent regardless of the birth weight of the newborn.\r"

Mean adult height of survivors (172.2 cm) was less than that of controls (174.1 cm), at a borderline significant difference of p = 0.0757. Multivariate analysis examined four potential, independent variables as possible predictors of this difference. The presence of brain tumor (vs. nonbrain tumor) (p less than .0001) and diagnosis at an early age (less than or equal to 8 years vs. 9-15 years) (p = .05) were factors significantly related to the differential; sex of patient and type of therapy were not. Our findings thus identify malignancy site and age at diagnosis as important predictors of adult height in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors.\r"

Commercial and altruistic motives have converged to promote community height screening among individuals who have been perceived by themselves or parents as short. This does not meet accepted criteria for health screening. Height screening of large populations of children yields few unrecognized medical conditions. If the goal of community screening is to identify abnormally short individuals (less than 3%) who might benefit from growth hormone treatment and if the unproven assumption is correct that stature correlates with success and happiness, then those less likely to appear for screening need to be recruited to avoid elitist domination. The annual cost of such growth promotion would be greater than $10 billion, with no evidence for substantial health benefits. Growth monitoring of all children through improved height measurement in schools and in physicians offices, as part of health supervision, is a more sound community approach than height screening.\r"

  ".W": "1. In a prospective study of 160 Asian outpatients, plasma calcium, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone were compared with a clinical score to determine which measurements singly or in combination were most useful in the detection of osteomalacia. 2. Bone biopsies were performed in 45 of 48 patients considered to be at risk of osteomalacia. Of the 39 quantifiable bone biopsies, nine showed unequivocal osteomalacia, 13 were judged to be borderline and 17 biopsies were normal. 3. The clinical score was highly sensitive, identifying eight of nine patients with osteomalacia, but not specific, six of 17 normal patients having an abnormal score. 4. Plasma parathyroid hormone was the best single biochemical test for identifying osteomalacia. By using a discriminant function based on parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase, it was possible to classify 96% cases correctly; a discriminant function utilizing calcium, phosphate and alkaline phosphatase was successful in 85% of cases. It was not possible to discriminate between histological groups on the basis of plasma 25-hydroxy-vitamin D values. 5. We confirm that the clinical score is a useful and inexpensive screening test for osteomalacia in British Asians. In those patients with an abnormal score we suggest that parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase are measured. Where both parathyroid hormone and alkaline phosphatase are high, in the absence of hypercalcaemia, histological osteomalacia is extremely likely.\r"

  ".W": "1. Six healthy male subjects received 0.9% (w/v) NaCl (saline) followed by incremental doses of bradykinin (1, 3 and 10 pmol/min), via the left brachial artery. Blood flow and the response of blood flow to lower-body negative pressure were measured in both forearms during infusion of saline and each dose of bradykinin. 2. Bradykinin produced a moderate and dose-dependent increase in blood flow in the infused, but not the non-infused, forearm. Lower-body negative pressure produced an approximately 15-20% reduction in blood flow in both forearms, and this response was unaffected by local infusion of bradykinin. 3. Bradykinin, in contrast to angiotensin II, had no acute effect on peripheral sympathetic responses to lower-body negative pressure. We conclude that, in forearm resistance vessels in man, withdrawal of angiotensin II, rather than accumulation of bradykinin, is likely to account for the attenuation of peripheral sympathetic responses after acute administration of a converting-enzyme inhibitor.\r"

The influence of long-acting propranolol and of atenolol on the circadian rhythm of heart rate was assessed using 24 h electrocardiographic recordings in elderly patients with essential hypertension. Eighteen elderly patients were investigated before treatment and after 12 weeks on 60 mg of long-acting propranolol once a day; 21 elderly patients were studied before treatment and after 12 weeks on 50 mg of atenolol once a day. The mean hourly heart rate in 24 h electrocardiographic recordings was used to fit cosine curves by the statistical technique of least squares, and the following parameters were estimated: mesor (rhythm-adjusted mean of the heart rate), amplitude (one-half of the total diurnal variation of the heart rate) and acrophase (the time when the heart rate was at its peak above the mean). 2. The cosine curves were fitted with a P value of 0.01 or less before and after treatment in all patients. 3. In the long-acting propranolol group, the mesor and amplitude were reduced significantly after treatment. The acrophase appeared significantly earlier after treatment than before treatment. 4. In the atenolol group, the mesor and amplitude decreased significantly after treatment. However, the acrophase did not change with treatment. 5. We conclude that both propranolol and atenolol decrease the mesor and amplitude through blocking cardiac beta 1-receptors, and that only propranolol may have some effects on the central nervous system, resulting in the circadian phase shift.\r"

The tissue distribution of 125I-cyanopindol-binding sites was assessed by autoradiography of complementary cryostat sections. The data obtained from the resections for carcinoma and bronchiectasis were used as disease controls for comparison with those obtained from patients with cystic fibrosis and asthma. 2. In carcinoma controls, mean Bmax values (+/- SEM) for airway levels I and II were 89 +/- 4 and 133 +/- 6 fmol/mg of protein, respectively (P less than 0.01). The corresponding KD values at each airway level were similar, i.e. 29 +/- 2 and 33 +/- 1 pmol/l, respectively. Autoradiography revealed that there was dense labelling of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and most strikingly of the alveolar wall. 3. Compared with carcinoma controls, mean Bmax values in cystic fibrosis were significantly reduced in membrane preparations of both airway levels I and II (P less than 0.01). Autoradiography showed the reduction was most apparent in alveolar wall and bronchial epithelium. 4. There was a tendency to reduction of Bmax in membrane preparations from patients with bronchiectasis at airway level I, but this failed to reach statistical significance. Autoradiography demonstrated that the density of labelling was significantly reduced in bronchial epithelium and bronchial smooth muscle as compared with carcinoma controls (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

In the run on nuclear transcription assay, sclerotic fibroblasts expressed an approximately eightfold higher level of hsp 70 transcription than normal fibroblasts in the quiescent condition after serum starvation. After stimulation with serum, the transcription level of the hsp 70 gene was almost similar in sclerotic and normal control fibroblasts. 3.

The pattern of arterial flow was abnormal in hypertensive patients, with the acceleration time, the duration of reverse flow and the time to maximum flow reversal being abbreviated. The internal arterial diameter, calculated from the velocity profile, was reduced despite raised pressure, suggesting altered arterial wall mechanics in essential hypertension. 3. These abnormalities will influence the wall shear stress, a major determinant of arterial function. The abnormal arterial wall mechanics and abnormal blood flow pattern may contribute to the increased risk of arterial disease in patients with untreated hypertension.\r"

Since early diagnosis and prompt therapy may favorably improve the outcome, and awareness of the problem may prevent it altogether, we urge physicians to be wary of this apparently new syndrome and take precautionary measures where applicable.\r"

And when the strategic plan is a joint effort, the CEO is less likely to be blamed if the plan fails. The strategic planning process is not always a smooth operation, say executives. Corporate and individual hospital boards have different perspectives and are not always on the same wavelength, which may leave the CEO caught in the middle. At the community level, developing a shared vision with the trustees is a time-consuming task. And in those communities where physicians are viewed as competitors, the CEO may find it tough to convince trustees that physicians must be part of an integrated plan.\r"

An interim strategy of using registered nurses to fill a full-time position for 1 year can cost upwards of $75,000 a year. Germane to the acclimatization of these nurses to the intensive care unit is the nurturing role of experienced nurses during the orientation and in assuring continuity of high-quality patient care. By virtue of their position, experienced nurses also model leadership behavior, and they are exposed to many day-to-day stresses that may leave them frustrated and feeling a lack of accomplishment. These factors, coupled with the scarcity of educational opportunities designed specifically for experienced nurses and a perceived absence of challenges, can lead to burnout. In this article I will describe an innovation in practice that uses the clinical nurse specialist role to stimulate and challenge experienced nurses.

By use of two-way analysis of variance statistics, no significant differences from baseline were found in SvO2 among the three groups, among the measurement times, or among the positions and times. Findings support elevating the backrest up to 40 degrees according to patient comfort, for patients 6.0 to 9.5 hours after coronary artery bypass graft surgery if they are up to 70 years of age, have no lung disease, are receiving optimal ventilation with up to 5 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure, have normal temperature, and are hemodynamically stable.\r"

The purpose of this pilot study was to explore, from a psychophysiologic perspective, the differences in anxiety, depression, and somatization during times of high and low levels of dyspnea. Six male subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with a mean age of 64 years and a mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second that was 44% of predicted, completed the study. They were assessed for clinical signs and their level of dyspnea indicated on a vertical visual analogue scale, after which they completed the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory and the Brief Symptom Inventory. Arterial blood was then drawn for blood gas analysis and determination of cortisol level. All measures were repeated twice, once when the subject reported a high level of dyspnea and once when he reported a low level. Analysis of the data by use of t tests for paired groups indicated that during times of high dyspnea levels subjects had greater anxiety, accessory muscle use, cortisol level, and PCO2 level. Subjects receiving oral prednisone had high depression levels that increased during times of severe dyspnea. Somatization, PO2, respiratory rate, depth of respiration, and other clinical signs did not change with dyspnea level. These results indicate that dyspnea is accompanied by both psychologic and physiologic changes that can be targeted to assist in alleviating this distressing symptom.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of counting resting and rapid radial pulse rates at 15-, 30-, and 60-second intervals. Difference scores were calculated between heart rates obtained by the 103 nurse subjects and rates obtained from simultaneous electrocardiographic tracings taken for the three counting intervals at resting rates and at rapid rates. Repeated-measures analysis of variance indicated no differences based on the subjects' educational level. Rapid heart rates (greater than or equal to 100 beats/min), as a whole, were significantly less accurate than resting rates (p = 0.0076). Although there was a significant main effect for length of counting interval (p = 0.0490), post hoc evaluation by Tukey's HSD test showed that only the 15-second rapid counts were significantly different from all the resting counts, but they were not different from the 30- or 60-second rapid counts. These results suggest that a 30-second counting interval may be the most accurate and efficient to use in counting the radial pulse and that the 15-second counting interval should not be used for rates faster than 100 beats/min.\r"

This risk is reduced by anticoagulating the patients with heparin after the procedure. The anticoagulation state of patients receiving heparin therapy is routinely monitored with the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test. In an effort to provide more timely results regarding the status of patients who are receiving heparin after PTCA, a study was conducted to see whether low-range activated clotting time measurement (LR ACT) performed at the bedside could provide information comparable to that from APTT values determined in the laboratory. The study showed that the LR ACT values were comparable to laboratory-generated APTT values (R2 = 0.68). The LR ACT data generated were superior to the APTT data in terms of timeliness and the wider range of heparin levels covered. Having these values available allowed the CCU staff to react rapidly to changes in the patient's coagulation status.\r"

Eight healthy subjects underwent a 20-min control period followed by 20 min of 15-mmHg LBNP. This pressure was selected because it did not cause any significant change in mean arterial blood pressure (sphygmomanometry) or heart rate, suggesting that the cardiopulmonary baroreceptors were selectively unloaded and the activity of the arterial baroreceptors was unchanged. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity in the peroneal nerve (MSNA, microneurography) increased from an average of 21.8 +/- 1.7 bursts/min over the last 5 min of control to 29.0 +/- 2.9 bursts/min during the 1st min of LBNP (P less than 0.05 LBNP vs. control). The increase in MSNA observed during the 1st min was sustained throughout LBNP. Forelimb blood flow (plethysmography) decreased abruptly at the onset of the LBNP from a control value of 4.3 +/- 0.5 ml.min-1.100 ml-1 to 2.5 +/- 0.2 at the 1st min; the flow then increased and remained significantly above this value, but below the control value, throughout LBNP. Similar blood flow findings were obtained in additional studies, when the hand circulation was excluded during the flow measurements. Forearm skin blood flow (laser Doppler) also decreased abruptly at the onset of LBNP and was followed by partial recovery, but these changes were too small to account for all the increases in limb blood flow over the course of LBNP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "We used a high-resolution ultrasound to make electrical recordings from the transversus abdominis muscle in humans. The behavior of this muscle was then compared with that of the external oblique and rectus abdominis in six normal subjects in the seated posture. During voluntary efforts such as expiration from functional residual capacity, speaking, expulsive maneuvers, and isovolume \"belly-in\" maneuvers, the transversus in general contracted together with the external oblique and the rectus abdominis. In contrast, during hyperoxic hypercapnia, all subjects had phasic expiratory activity in the transversus at ventilations between 10 and 18 l/min, well before activity could be recorded from either the external oblique or the rectus abdominis. Similarly, inspiratory elastic loading evoked transversus expiratory activity in all subjects but external oblique activity in only one subject and rectus abdominis activity in only two subjects. We thus conclude that in humans 1) the transversus abdominis is recruited preferentially to the superficial muscle layer of the abdominal wall during breathing and 2) the threshold for abdominal muscle recruitment during expiration is substantially lower than conventionally thought.\r"

The goals of this study were to inactivate, with phenoxybenzamine, a fraction of the muscarinic receptors present in canine tracheal smooth muscle, and then to determine whether this decrease in muscarinic receptor reserve altered the potency with which isoproterenol relaxed submaximal muscarinic contractions. Strips of smooth muscle were suspended from force transducers in vitro and preincubated with either vehicle (untreated) or phenoxybenzamine (10(-5) M) for 30 min. For muscarinic contractions induced by carbachol that were approximately 70-80% of maximum, the half-maximally effective concentration of isoproterenol was 2.4 +/- 0.8 x 10(-7) M for untreated strips but 5.8 +/- 1.3 x 10(-9) M for strips treated with phenoxybenzamine (n = 6, P less than 0.05). We concluded that treatment with phenoxybenzamine increased the sensitivity of a submaximal muscarinic contraction to isoproterenol. The results support the hypothesis that the muscarinic receptor reserve for contraction is an important determinant of the potency with which isoproterenol relaxes submaximal muscarinic contractions.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that tendons that normally experience relatively high stresses and function as springs during locomotion, such as digital flexors, might develop different mechanical properties from those that experience only relatively low stresses, such as digital extensors. At birth the digital flexor and extensor tendons of pigs have identical mechanical properties, exhibiting higher extensibility and mechanical hysteresis and lower elastic modulus, tensile strength, and elastic energy storage capability than adult tendons. With growth and aging these tendons become much stronger, stiffer, less extensible, and more resilient than at birth. Furthermore, these alterations in elastic properties occur to a significantly greater degree in the high-load-bearing flexors than in the low-stress extensors. At maturity the pig digital flexor tendons have twice the tensile strength and elastic modulus but only half the strain energy dissipation of the corresponding extensor tendons. A morphometric analysis of the digital muscles provides an estimate of maximal in vivo tendon stresses and suggests that the muscle-tendon unit of the digital flexor is designed to function as an elastic energy storage element whereas that of the digital extensor is not. Thus the differences in material properties between mature flexor and extensor tendons are correlated with their physiological functions, i.e., the flexor is much better suited to act as an effective biological spring than is the extensor.\r"

For comparison, 1-mo-old pigs were also studied. Studies were performed 1 day after surgery, during which time ventilation (barometric plethysmography), heart rate, blood pressure, arterial blood gases, and electroencephalogram were recorded under normoxia. CX and CAX piglets hypoventilated (arterial PCO2 = 47.1 +/- 2.6 and 45.4 +/- 3.1 Torr, respectively) compared with SHAM piglets (arterial PCO2 = 36.4 +/- 1.5 Torr). CX piglets had an average of 8.0 +/- 3.0 apneas/h, lasting, on average, 26 +/- 3 s. CAX piglets averaged 17.2 +/- 7.9 apneas/h, lasting 30 +/- 5 s. Such long apneas were never observed in SHAM animals. Mean heart rate and blood pressure in denervated piglets were not significantly different from those in SHAM piglets. In animals followed up poststudy, significantly high mortality was observed in CX (5 of 9) and CAX (6 of 9) piglets by 7 days after surgery but not in SHAM animals (0 of 7) despite identical environmental and feed conditions (P less than 0.05; chi 2). One-month-old denervated animals showed periodic breathing and hypoventilation, but none died. These results suggest that in the newborn piglet 1) peripheral chemoreceptors have an active role in maintaining normal ventilation and avoidance of prolonged apnea and 2) survivability in early life is critically dependent on peripheral chemoreceptors.\r"

No consistent difference in resting lactate concentrations, 1.17 +/- 0.09 mM, was observed between control and trained animals with no exogenous infusion of lactate. With increasing lactate infusion rates, control animals demonstrated a twofold greater increase in blood lactate concentration (range 1.2-11.4 mM) compared with trained animals (range 1.0-5.5 mM). This response resulted from a more rapid rise in net lactate removal with changes in blood lactate concentration for trained animals. The estimated maximal reaction velocity for net lactate removal in trained animals was 19% lower than in control animals; however, the Michaelis-Menten constant was greater than 66% lower in trained animals (4 mM) compared with controls (12 mM). Control animals also demonstrated a twofold greater increase in lactate concentration as a function of the tracer-estimated lactate turnover. The ratio of 14CO2 yield to lactate specific activity as a function of total tracer removal was not significantly different between groups, suggesting that the relative contributions of oxidation and gluconeogenesis to lactate removal were similar for both groups. At blood concentrations greater than 1 mM, trained animals achieve higher rates of lactate removal for any given lactate concentration.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the synergistic interaction between platelet-activating factor (PAF) and protamine sulfate, a cationic protein that causes pulmonary endothelial injury, in isolated rat lungs perfused with a physiological salt solution. A low dose of protamine (50 micrograms/ml) increased pulmonary artery perfusion pressure (Ppa) but did not increase wet lung-to-body weight ratio after 20 min. Pretreatment of the lungs with a noninjurious dose of PAF (1.6 nM) 10 min before protamine markedly potentiated protamine-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction and resulted in severe lung edema and increased lung tissue content of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, thromboxane B2, and leukotriene C4. Pulmonary microvascular pressure (Pmv), measured by double occlusion, was markedly increased in lungs given PAF and protamine. These potentiating effects of PAF were blocked by WEB 2086 (10(-5) M), a specific PAF receptor antagonist. Pretreatment of the lungs with a high dose of histamine (10(-4) M) failed to enhance the effect of protamine on Ppa, Pmv, or wet lung-to-body weight ratio. Furthermore, PAF pretreatment enhanced elastase-, but not H2O2-, induced lung edema. To assess the role of hydrostatic pressure in edema formation, we compared lung permeability-surface area products (PS) in papaverine-treated lungs given either protamine alone or PAF + protamine and tested the effect of mechanical elevation of Pmv on protamine-induced lung edema. In the absence of vasoconstriction, PAF did not potentiate protamine-induced increase in lung PS. On the other hand, mechanically raising Pmv in protamine-treated lungs to a level similar to that measured in lungs given PAF + protamine did not result in a comparable degree of lung edema. We conclude that PAF potentiates protamine-induced lung edema predominantly by enhanced pulmonary venoconstriction. However, a pressure-independent effect of PAF on lung vasculature cannot be entirely excluded.\r"

The first (n = 48) were exercise trained after 38 days of age, whereas the second (n = 44) initiated exercise training when the animals were 134 days of age. To facilitate cerebrovascular lesions, the sodium concentrations in the rat chow and in the drinking solutions were increased. Symptoms utilized to denote the presence of cerebrovascular lesions were irritability, hyperresponsiveness, ataxia, lethargy, unwillingness to run, and combinations thereof. All brains were removed immediately after death, fixed, and evaluated grossly and microscopically for lesions. In the study with the younger animals, training was associated with a 7-9% increase in VO2max that was statistically significant only in animals with no histological evidence of cerebrovascular lesions. For the older animals, a significant 5-8% increase in VO2max was noted for animals with or without lesions. After 42 days of training for both groups, resting blood pressures for the trained groups with histological lesions were significantly lower. However, this trend did not continue, and the older trained rats appeared to have strokes earlier and to die sooner than their nontrained controls. Although 83% of the older animals had subjective evidence for a stroke before they died, the percentage of animals with lesions ranged from 42 to 58%, with the trained groups having higher percentages.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

It is shown here that CBV can then be derived from the expression CBV = (delta[HbO2] - delta[Hb])/(2. delta SaO2.H.R.), where H is the large vessel total hemoglobin concentration and R to the cerebral-to-large vessel hematocrit ratio. Observations on 12 newborn infants with normal brains, born at 25-40 wk of gestation and aged 10-240 h, gave a mean value for CBV of 2.22 +/- 0.40 (SD) ml/100 g, whereas mean CBV was significantly higher 3.00 +/- 1.04 ml/100 g in 10 infants with brain injury born at 24 to 42 wk of gestation and aged 4-168 h (P less than 0.05).\r"

  ".W": "Recent studies have suggested a close association between total respiratory compliance (Crs) and tidal volume in anesthetized paralyzed infants who are being artificially ventilated. To investigate this further, the multiple occlusion technique was used to measure Crs in 20 anesthetized infants and young children (aged 1-25 mo) before elective surgery. Measurements were made after intubation 1) during spontaneous breathing (SB), 2) after administration of a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant with tidal volume and frequency mimicking that during SB, and 3) with the child still paralyzed but tidal volume approximately double that during SB. Compared with values obtained during SB, there was no significant change in Crs after paralysis when ventilation matched the child's own pattern (P greater than 0.2). When ventilated with the larger tidal volumes, the infants showed a highly significant increase in Crs (mean 62%, range 14-158%, P less than 0.0001). These results may have implications not only for studies performed during anesthesia but also when infants were monitored in the intensive care setting. Values of Crs obtained in ventilated infants may reflect both the mechanical behavior of the respiratory system and the pattern of ventilation at the time of measurement.\r"

Alveolar wash-saturated PC pool sizes in betamethasone-exposed fetuses were less than in controls (P less than 0.01). At higher doses, total lung saturated PC also decreased (P less than 0.01). Maximal lung volumes on pressure-volume loops were larger than controls only at the 0.4 mg.kg-1.day-1 dose (P less than 0.05). The larger maximal volumes, despite decreased saturated PC pools, indicated increased responsiveness of the steroid-treated lungs to the smaller saturated PC pool sizes. Vascular-to-alveolar iodinated albumin leak decreased with steroid treatment independently of dose (P less than 0.01). No consistent pattern of increased precursor incorporation into saturated PC by lung slices was seen. Our results indicate that, in preterm rabbits exposed to a range of maternal corticosteroid doses, the beneficial lung maturational effect of structural alterations with increased responses to endogenous saturated PC pools was maximal even at the lowest dose.\r"

  ".W": "We studied the effect of aminophylline (0.1-1 mM) on the mechanical and electrical activity of rat diaphragm bundles in vitro (25 degrees C). The main findings are the following. 1) Aminophylline potentiates the twitch tension. The tetanus tension is not modified, although the rate of decay is decreased. 2) The relation between K contracture tension and resting membrane potential (Vm) is shifted toward more negative values of the Vm in the aminophylline-containing solution. 3) The mechanical threshold measured by direct visualization of the fiber is also lowered in the fibers equilibrated in aminophylline. These effects are reversible by washing out the preparation with normal solution. 4) The shift in the relation between tension and Vm induced by aminophylline is reversed by 1 microM nifedipine. 5) The generation of action potential is not modified by aminophylline. We suggest that the shift in the mechanical threshold is the principal factor involved in the potentiating effect of aminophylline. We speculate that theophylline acts to augment tension by enhancing calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and that nifedipine blocks this release (E. Rios, and G. Brum. Nature Lond. 325: 717-720, 1987).\r"

Six subjects made two-legged isometric quadriceps contractions at 30% maximal voluntary contraction for 6 s with 4 s of rest between until exhaustion (58 +/- 8 min). Blood samples were taken from the femoral vein and artery, and blood velocity was recorded by ultrasound-Doppler technique in the femoral artery. Blood flow was calculated from velocity and artery diameter values. Leg VO2 increased sixfold within the 1st min of exercise. A further doubling of the VO2 was seen during the remainder of the exercise, reaching 307 +/- 22 ml/min at exhaustion. This latter increase was due to a 54% increase in blood flow and a 34% increase in oxygen extraction. After 20 min of recovery VO2 was still 75% higher than preexercise values. The results show a twofold increase in energy demand of the working muscle during repeated constant-force isometric contractions. The increased energy cost of contraction is probably localized at the cellular level, and it parallels fatigue determined as decreased force-generating capacity.\r"

Everest in a hypobaric chamber; both electrically activated and maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) were employed. The purpose of this study was to establish whether, under conditions of progressive chronic hypoxia, there was a decrease in muscle force output and/or increased fatigability. We also attempted to identify the main site of any failure, i.e., central nervous system, neuromuscular junction, or muscle fiber. Muscle twitch torque (Pt), tetanic torque (Po), MVC torque, and evoked muscle compound action potential (M wave) were monitored during 205-s exercise periods in five subjects at three simulated altitudes (760, 335, and 282 Torr). All three types of torque measurement were well preserved at the three altitudes. In some subjects, the responses to stimuli interpolated during repeated MVCs provided evidence of \"central\" fatigue at altitude. In addition, the rate of fatigue during 20-Hz electrical stimulation was greater (P less than 0.01) at altitude and there was increased fatigability of the twitch (P less than 0.025); however, the M wave amplitude was maintained. We conclude that central motor drive becomes more precarious at altitude and is associated with increased muscle fatigue at low excitation frequencies; the latter is the result, in part, of chronic hypoxia and occurs in the muscle fiber interior because no impairment in neuromuscular transmission could be demonstrated.\r"

Ten women performed submaximal cycle (up to 60 W) and treadmill (4 km/h, up to 10% grade) exercise tests at 34 +/- 1.5 (SD) wk gestation and 7.6 +/- 1.7 wk postpartum. Postpartum subjects wearing weighted belts designed to equal their body weight during the antepartum tests performed two additional treadmill tests. Absolute O2 uptake (VO2) at the same work load was higher during pregnancy than postpartum during cycle (1.04 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.09 l/min, P = 0.014), treadmill (1.45 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.27 +/- 0.20 l/min, P = 0.0002), and weighted treadmill (1.45 +/ 0.19 vs. 1.36 +/- 0.20 l/min, P = 0.04) exercise. None of these differences remained, however, when VO2 was expressed per kilogram of body weight. Maximal VO2 (VO2max) estimated from the individual heart rate-VO2 curves was the same during and after pregnancy during cycling (1.96 +/- 0.37 to 1.98 +/- 0.39 l/min), whereas estimated VO2max increased postpartum during treadmill (2.04 +/- 0.38 to 2.21 +/- 0.36 l/min, P = 0.03) and weighted treadmill (2.04 +/- 0.38 to 2.19 +/- 0.38 l/min, P = 0.03) exercise. We conclude that increased body weight during pregnancy compared with the postpartum period accounts for 75% of the increased VO2 during submaximal weight-bearing exertion in pregnancy and contributes to reduced exercise capacity. The postpartum increase in estimated VO2max during weight-bearing exercise is the result of consistently higher antepartum heart rates during all submaximal work loads.\r"

Increase in the discharge rate of all the motor units resulted in nearly constant median frequency. It was concluded that the increasing average conduction velocity during motor unit recruitment is the major contributor to variations in the electromyogram median frequency. The possibility of using the median frequency as the index to identify the recruitment control strategies employed by various muscles during increasing force contraction is suggested.\r"

EMGdi and EMGab were measured with esophageal and transcutaneous electrodes, respectively. During wakefulness, EMGdi increased in response to acute loading (18 cmH2O.l-1.s) (+23%); this was accompanied by preservation of tidal volume (VT) and minute ventilation (VE). During NREM sleep, no augmentation was noted in EMGdi or EMGab. Inspiratory time (TI) was prolonged (+5%), but this was not sufficient to prevent a decrease in both VT and VE (-21 and -20%, respectively). During sustained loading (12 cmH2O.l-1 s) in NREM sleep, control breaths (C) were compared with the steady-state loaded breaths (SS) defined by breaths 41-50. Steady-state IRL was associated with augmentation of EMGdi (12%) and EMGab (50%). VT returned to control levels, expiratory time shortened, and breathing frequency increased. The net result was the increase in VE above control levels (+5%, P less than 0.01). No change was noted in end-tidal CO2 or O2. We concluded that 1) wakefulness is a prerequisite for immediate load compensation (in its absence, TI prolongation is the only compensatory response) and 2) during sustained IRL, the augmentation of EMGdi and EMGab can lead to complete ventilatory recovery without measurable changes in chemical stimuli.\r"

Physiol. 54: 562-570, 1983); this reflex response was believed to result from a stimulation of rapidly adapting receptors in the lungs. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the vagal afferent activity arising from the rapidly adapting receptors in the lungs and delivered 120 ml of high- and low-nicotine cigarette smoke separately in a single ventilatory cycle in 20 anesthetized open-chest and artificially ventilated dogs. These receptors were stimulated on the first breath of delivery of smoke generated by high-nicotine cigarettes; activity increased from a base line of 0.9 +/- 0.2 to a peak of 9.9 +/- 1.2 (SE) impulses/breath (n = 58). After three to six breaths when the receptors' discharge returned toward base-line activity, a delayed increase of activity emerged (peak activity = 3.4 +/- 0.6 impulses/breath, n = 58) in 32 of the 58 receptors studied and lasted for three to seven breaths. By contrast, only a mild stimulatory effect of low-nicotine cigarette smoke was found, either immediately or after a delay, in 15 of the 54 receptors studied. We conclude that rapidly adapting receptors are stimulated by a single breath of cigarette smoke and that nicotine is the primary stimulant agent.\r"

Insufflation of gamma-interferon (5 micrograms) or intraperitoneal injection of up to 40 micrograms TNF did not afford any protection. At 55 h after O2 exposure, TNF-insufflated rats showed less pulmonary edema, as determined by the extravascular lung water content-to-bloodless lung dry weigh ratio and less alveolar capillary leak as determined by the protein content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, than control insufflated rats similarly exposed. This protection against O2 toxicity by TNF insufflation was associated with increased lung superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities. The enhancement of lung antioxidant enzyme activities was noted at 55 h of O2 exposure, when control animals began to die of O2 toxicity. This temporal relationship suggests that TNF-induced increase in antioxidant enzyme activities contributes, at least in part, to the observed protection.\r"

Animals were instrumented with Doppler flow probes on the mesenteric and renal arteries and exposed to an ambient temperature of 40 degrees C. Heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and core (Tc) and tail skin temperatures were also monitored. As Tc progressively increased from 37 degrees C during heat exposure, MAP rose to a plateau and then fell precipitously as Tc exceeded 41.5 degrees C. Mesenteric resistance increased throughout the early stages of heating before sharply declining prior to the reduction in MAP. The pressor and mesenteric resistance responses to constant infusions of several adrenergic agonists after MAP began falling (Tc = 41.3 degrees C) were significantly (P less than 0.05) attenuated compared with infusions into normothermic animals. In a second set of experiments, injections of both norepinephrine and angiotensin II were made 30 min before and approximately 10, 30, 50, 70, and 90 min after initiation of heating. These injections increased both MAP and mesenteric resistance; however, at TcS greater than 40 degrees C, the responses to both agonists were progressively and significantly attenuated. In a final group of animals, barium chloride infusions produced similar pressor and regional resistance changes during both normothermia and severe hyperthermia (Tc greater than 42 degrees C). These results indicate that, in the chloralose-anesthetized rat, hyperthermia disrupts adrenoceptor function but does not alter the intrinsic ability of vascular smooth muscle to contract.\r"

The anatomic position of this front, which is determined by the balance between diffusive flux toward the airway opening and convective flux toward the periphery, is frequently used to predict the effects of molecular diffusivity and inspiratory flow rate on dead space. Although there is substantial experimental evidence supporting the predictive effect of molecular diffusivity, there is little evidence regarding the effect of convective flow. This study confirmed the predictions for the effects of molecular diffusivity but contradicted those for the effects of inspiratory flow. We measured dead space by multiple- and single-breath inert gas washout techniques and also measured physiological dead space in dogs for inspiratory flow rates of 10-71 ml.kg-1.s-1. None of the three measures of dead space increased over the entire range of flow rate, as predicted by contemporary gas transport models. A possible explanation for these findings is that axial dispersion coefficients in the anatomic region where stationary fronts are believed to develop (respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts) significantly increase with convective flow rate rather than remain equal to molecular diffusivity.\r"

Five control sheep were ventilated with an aerosol of 99mTc-albumin for 6 min, and the lung lymphatic concentration of the tracer was monitored for the next 2 h. During the last 45 min the lymphatic concentration stabilized at a value that was 0.03 +/- 0.01% of the estimated value in the air spaces. Pulmonary vascular hypertension, induced in seven sheep by increasing the left atrial pressure 20 cmH2O for 4 h, increased the lung lymph flow from a base-line value of 3 +/- 2 to 21 +/- 14 ml/h. This caused the concentration of the 99mTc-albumin in the lymph to double to 0.07 +/- 0.03% of the air space concentration (P less than 0.01). Lung injury induced by infusing 0.08-0.10 ml/kg oleic acid intravenously in seven other sheep increased the lymphatic concentration of the 99mTc-albumin 10-fold to 0.31 +/- 0.09% of the air space concentration (P less than 0.01). The increased tracer concentration in the sheep with pulmonary vascular hypertension could be the result of the increased lymph flow causing a diversion of tracer into the lymphatics. However, a mathematical model showed that the 10-fold increase in the lymphatic concentration in the sheep with lung injury was primarily the result of an increase in both permeability and surface area of the epithelium that participated in the transfer of the 99mTc-albumin from the air spaces into the lung tissue drained by the lymphatics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

One hundred percent O2 also increased lung weight gain and alveolar-capillary permeability to aerosolized 99mTc-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (99mTc-DTPA, 500 mol wt) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran (7,000 mol wt). Pretreatment with vitamin E, BHA, or the combination of PEG-SOD and PEG-catalase prevented the increase in malondialdehyde, lung weight gain, and alveolar-capillary permeability caused by hyperoxia. These results indicate that augmenting either tissue antioxidants or antioxidant enzymes can prevent the pulmonary injury caused by 48 h of 100% O2 in rabbits.\r"

LTB4 (2 micrograms/kg injection followed by infusion of 2 micrograms/kg over 15 min) produced transient increases in pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, indicating that neutrophils were not required for the pulmonary hemodynamic effects of LTB4. Infusion of LTB4 in granulocyte-depleted sheep also resulted in transient increases in pulmonary lymph flow (QL) with no significant change in the lymph-to-plasma protein concentration ratio (L/P), findings similar to those in control animals. In vitro studies indicated that LTB4 (10(-7) or 10(-9) M) produced a transient adherence of neutrophils to cultured pulmonary artery endothelial monolayers. Maximal responses occurred at 10 min after the addition of LTB4 to the endothelial cell-neutrophil coculture system, and the adherence decreased to base line within 60 min. LTB4 infusion in sheep also produced a transient uptake of autologous 111In-oxine-labeled neutrophils. The results indicate that LTB4-mediated increase in pulmonary transvascular protein clearance (QL x L/P) is independent of circulating granulocytes.\r"

When the sensor is calibrated on an aluminum cylinder, the calibration constant obtained is greatest in still air. As air movement increases, the calibration constant is reduced with increasing convective heat transfer coefficient, 0.5%.W-1.m2.K. The influence of wind on the calibration value is greatly reduced when the sensor is attached to a surface with lower thermal conductivity. The local convective heat transfer coefficient (hc) of the human body was measured. The leg acts in a manner similar to that of a cylinder, with the highest hc value at the front facing the wind and the lowest approximately 90 degrees from the wind, and in the wake a value is obtained that is close to the average hc value of the leg. When hc is measured at several angles and positions all over the body, the results indicate that the body acts approximately as a cylinder with a hc value related to the wind speed as hc = 8.6.v0.6 W.m-2.K-1, where v is velocity.\r"

Stimulation frequency-force and stimulation frequency-power relationships were determined for soleus and EDL muscles of the mouse for single contractions in situ at 35 degrees C. Power was measured during isovelocity shortening contractions with displacement through 10% of fiber length at the optimum velocity. Optimum velocity was defined as the shortening velocity for the generation of maximum power for a given stimulation frequency. Both force (N/cm2) and power (watts/kg) increased with stimulation frequency until a plateau was reached. For the frequency-force relationship, the curve for soleus muscles was merely shifted to the left of that for EDL muscles. In contrast, the power developed by EDL muscles was greater than that of soleus muscles (P less than 0.05) at each stimulation frequency. The higher power was a direct consequence of higher optimum velocities for EDL muscles compared with soleus muscles.\r"

At the lowest frequencies, the pulmonary resistance showed a marked negative frequency dependence and mirrored the changes in the reactance with altered Ptp. The ZL data were evaluated on the basis of two models, each containing the same airway compartment with a resistance and an inertance. The tissue impedance (Zti) in model 1 was represented with two compliances and a resistance (L. E. Mount. J. Physiol. Lond. 127: 157-167, 1955), whereas in model 2 a two-parameter formulation implying rate-independent dissipated work and frequency-dependent elastance (J. Hildebrandt. J. Appl. Physiol. 28: 365-372, 1970) was employed. The estimation of model parameters showed that model 2 was superior to model 1 in both fitting performance and parameter insensitivity to weighting in the fitting criterion. The model 2 coefficients of damping and elastance, characterizing the real and imaginary parts of Zti, respectively, depended on the lung distension and were closely correlated. Although ZL exhibited a slight dependence on the peak-to-peak volume excursion, at a given oscillatory volume no inconsistency with linear tissue viscoelasticity was detected.\r"

In six animals, during bilateral parasternal stimulation a linear relationship between contractile force exerted on the rib and PIP was demonstrated (r greater than 0.95). In eight animals, during quiet active inspiration, substantial (55 +/- 11.5 cmH2O) PIP was developed. During inspiratory resistive loading and airway occlusion the inspiratory rise in PIP increased in proportion to the inspiratory fall in pleural pressure (r = 0.82). Phrenicotomy and vagotomy resulted in an increase in the inspiratory rise in PIP of 21% and 99%, respectively. During passive deflation, when the parasternal intercostals were passively lengthened, large rises (320 +/- 221 cmH2O) in intramuscular pressure were observed. During passive inflation intramuscular pressure remained constant or even decreased slightly (-8 +/- 25 cmH2O) as expected on the basis of the passive shortening of the muscles. PIP thus invariably increased when tension increased either actively or passively. From PIP it is clear that the parasternals exert significant forces on the ribs during respiratory maneuvers.\r"

One hypothesis proposes that the kinetics might be explained by considering the tissue as a collection of parallel compartments, each with its own flow, reflecting the tissue microcirculatory flow heterogeneity. In this study, observed tissue gas kinetics were compared with the kinetics predicted by a model of multiple parallel compartments. Gas exchange curves were generated by recording the time course of tissue radioactivity in the intact calf muscles of anesthetized ventilated dogs exposed to step function changes of 133Xe in the inspired air for 5-h periods. Microcirculatory flow heterogeneity in the same tissue was determined by the radioactive microsphere method. Observed mean tissue transit times were on average longer than predicted by a factor of 6.7. Observed means averaged 52.1 min compared with 8.3 min predicted by the perfusion-limited model. Relative dispersions of tissue transit times were also uniformly larger than predicted. We conclude that Xe gas kinetics in intact canine skeletal muscle are not explained by a model of multiple parallel perfusion-limited compartments. Countercurrent exchange of gas between vessels is a possible explanation.\r"

The findings of each period were compared with those of untrained men. Endurance training of the long-distance runners and the swimmers led both to a reduced sympathetic activity at rest, indicated by lower CA values, and to a lower beta-receptor density and responsiveness on circulating lymphocytes and an increased alpha 2-receptor sensitivity on circulating platelets. During the high-intensity training period beta-receptor density and responsiveness increased, alpha 2-receptor sensitivity normalized, and heart rate as well as blood pressure values increased in both trained groups. The basal sympathetic activity remained reduced, but the norepinephrine-to-epinephrine (NE/EPI) ratio increased. The NE/EPI ratio might play an important part in the regulation of adrenoceptor density during these different training periods. Swimming-specific characteristics caused different physiological impacts compared with running training, but an attenuated baroreceptor sensitivity might be indicated in both intensively trained groups.\r"

The continuous model proposed by Hughson et al. (J. Appl. Physiol. 62: 1975-1981, 1987) was well fitted with the individual blood lactate concentration vs. work rate curves obtained during exercise. Time courses of lactate concentrations during recovery were accurately described by a sum of two exponential functions. Significant direct linear relationships were found between the velocity constant (gamma 2 nu) of the slowly decreasing exponential term of the recovery curves and the times into the exercise when a lactate concentration of 2.5 mmol/l was reached. There was a significant inverse correlation between gamma 2 nu and the rate of lactate increase during the last step of the exercise. In terms of the functional meaning given to gamma 2 nu, these relationships indicate that the shift to higher work rates of the increase of the blood lactate concentration during graded exercise in fit or trained athletes, when compared with less fit or untrained ones, is associated with a higher ability to remove lactate during the recovery. The results suggest that the lactate removal ability plays an important role in the evolution pattern of blood lactate concentrations during graded exercise.\r"

To determine whether pulmonary vasoconstriction, mediated by a circulating agent, contributes to the PH, the left lower lung lobe (LLL) perfusion of seven splenectomized (to keep hematocrit and blood viscosity constant) dogs was isolated so the LLL could be perfused at constant flow and outflow pressure with blood pumped from the pulmonary artery. The LLL was denervated by removing it from the dog. Veratrine (40-160 micrograms/kg) increased LLL arterial pressure by 39.2% and produced large increases in plasma catecholamine concentrations. The double-occlusion technique indicated that 74% of the increase in the LLL arteriovenous pressure gradient was due to an increase in venous tone. This pattern of vasoconstriction was similar to that previously observed during the infusion of exogenous catecholamines and suggested that catecholamines mediated the LLL response. The more severe degree of PH observed in the intact animal in NPE, however, suggests that passive rather than active changes in pulmonary hemodynamics are predominantly responsible for the development of PH in this disorder.\r"

In the present study the effects of hindlimb unloading on muscle mass and biochemical responses were examined and compared in adult (450 g) and juvenile (200 g) rats after 1, 7, or 14 days of whole body suspension. Quantitatively and qualitatively the soleus (S), gastrocnemius (G), plantaris (P), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the hindlimb exhibited a differential sensitivity to suspension and weightlessness unloading in both adults and juveniles. The red slow-twitch soleus exhibited the most pronounced atrophy under both conditions, with juvenile responses being greater than adult. In contrast, the fast-twitch EDL hypertrophied during suspension and atrophied during weightlessness, with no significant difference between adults and juveniles. Determination of biochemical parameters (total protein, RNA, and DNA) indicated a less rapid rate of response in adult muscles. This was corroborated by assessment of muscle alpha-actin mRNA levels, which indicated a rapid (within 1 day) and significant (P less than 0.05) effect in juveniles but not in adults. The results of this investigation indicate 1) a qualitatively similar differential effect of unloading on muscles of adults and juveniles, 2) a quantitatively reduced and less rapid effect of suspension on adult muscles, and 3) a close similarity of adult and juvenile muscle responses during suspension and spaceflight, suggesting that this ground-based model simulates many of the unloading effects of weightlessness.\r"

Neither of these increases was produced by the same stimulation when applied during anodal block of volleys of group I fibers. Hyperpnea could be obtained independently from changes in cardiovascular activity, and the pressor response could be obtained during artificial ventilation at constant tidal volume after curarization. Consequently, it appears that respiratory and cardiovascular responses to stimulation of group I fibers can be independent of each other.\r"

The experimental group consisted of six anesthetized paralyzed adult baboons (Papio anubis) that were exchange transfused (ET) with a pyridoxylated polymerized hemoglobin solution [hemoglobin concentration [( Hb]) = 14 g/dl, O2 half-saturation pressure of hemoglobin (P50) = 19.6 Torr] until a hematocrit less than 1% was achieved.

Both groups maintained O2 consumption (VO2) until [Hb] = 3 g/dl. Both groups were stable until [Hb] less than 1 g/dl, and both groups increased their cardiac output. The relation between VO2 and O2 delivery was similar for both groups. In vivo P50 and mixed venous O2 tension were significantly lower in the experimental group. The nature and limits of compensation to diminished O2 delivery due to anemia were similar in the two groups.\r"

In resting untrained sham-injected rats, blood glucose and lactate were 7.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.3 +/- 0.1 mM, respectively; glucose rate of appearance (Ra) was 71.1 +/- 12.1 mumol.kg-1.min-1. MPA treatment lowered blood glucose, raised lactate, and decreased glucose Ra. Trained animals had significantly higher glucose Ra at rest and during exercise. At rest, trained MPA-treated rats had lower blood glucose, higher blood lactate, and similar glucose Ra and disappearance rates (Rd) than trained sham-injected animals. Exercising sham-injected untrained animals had increased blood glucose and glucose Ra compared with rest. Exercising trained sham-injected rats had increased blood glucose and glucose Ra and Rd but no change in blood lactate compared with untrained sham-injected animals. In the trained animals during exercise, MPA treatment increased blood lactate and decreased blood glucose and glucose Ra and Rd. There was no measurable glucose recycling in trained or untrained MPA-treated animals either at rest or during submaximal exercise. There was no difference in running time to exhaustion between trained and untrained MPA-treated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

Cigarette smoke (6 ml, 50%) generated by a machine was inhaled spontaneously via a tracheal cannula. Within the first two breaths of smoke inhalation, a slowing of respiration resulting from a prolonged expiratory duration (173 +/- 6% of the base line; n = 32) was elicited in 88% of the rats studied. This initial inhibitory effect on breathing was not affected either by an increase (410%) in the nicotine content of the cigarette smoke or by pretreatment with hexamethonium (33 mg/kg iv). However, bilateral vagotomy completely eliminated the initial ventilatory inhibition. Cooling both vagi to 5.1 degrees C blocked the reflex apneic response to lung inflation, but it did not abolish the inhibitory effect of smoke. After the initial response, a rapid shallow breathing pattern developed and reached its peak 5-12 breaths after inhalation of high-nicotine cigarette smoke; this delayed response could not be prevented by vagotomy and was undetectable after inhalation of low-nicotine smoke. We conclude that the initial inhibitory effect of smoke on breathing is mediated by vagal bronchopulmonary C-fiber afferents, which are stimulated by smoke constituents other than nicotine, whereas the delayed tachypneic response to smoke is caused by the absorbed nicotine.\r"

  ".W": "Does exercise alter the redistribution and clearance of particles from the lungs? Sedentary hamsters and hamsters that were exercise trained by voluntary wheel running for the previous 5 wk were exposed to a 198Au-labeled aerosol for 25 min. Six trained and 6 sedentary animals were killed within 5 min after the exposure (day 0); the same number were killed 5 days later. The trained hamsters ran ad libitum during those 5 days. The lungs of all animals were excised, dried at total lung capacity, sliced into 1-mm-thick sections, and dissected into pieces that were counted for radioactivity and weighed. On day 0, trained hamsters had 80% more particles per milligram of lung than sedentary hamsters, although both were exposed under identical conditions of restraint. After five days, exercising hamsters cleared 38% of the particles present at day 0, whereas sedentary animals removed only 15%. Significant clearance was observed from the middle lung regions of sedentary hamsters and from all lung regions in exercising hamsters. We conclude that exercise can enhance the redistribution and clearance of particles from the lungs; the mechanisms responsible are as yet unclear.\r"

  ".U": "90256683\r", 
  ".W": "To define the physiological signals involved in the redirection of myosin expression in the swim-exercised rat, the relative influence of thyroid hormones and beta-adrenergic blockade was determined. Swimming exercise resulted in an increased proportion of myosin V1 (60.9 +/- 9.7 vs. 38.0 +/- 4.1% of sedentary rats fed ad libitum) but did not increase serum concentrations of total and free thyroxine or triiodothyronine determined either 17-21 h or immediately after swimming. The proportion of V1 increased, although intermittently food-deprived rats with the body weight of swimming rats exhibited a reduced proportion of V1 (23.5 +/- 2.7). When swimming rats had only intermittent access to food, they had reduced concentrations of all thyroid hormones, but the proportion of V1 (51.5 +/- 7.6) was nonetheless increased. Thus the redirection of myosin expression cannot be attributed to an increased secretion of thyroid hormones. The influence of the adrenergic system was assessed by treating swimming rats with the beta-blocking drug atenolol. Because the proportion of V1 was reduced, but thyroid hormones were not affected, beta-adrenergic blockade seems to influence myosin expression independently of thyroid hormones.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of cardiovascular adjustments on the coupling of cellular to pulmonary gas exchange during unsteady states of exercise remains controversial. Computer simulations were performed to assess these influences on O2 delivery and pulmonary O2 uptake (pVO2). Algorithms were developed representing muscle and \"rest-of-body\" compartments, connected in parallel by arterial and venous circulations to a pump-and-lungs compartment. Exercise-induced increases in VO2 and cardiac output went to the muscle compartment. Model parameters [e.g., time constants for blood flow and muscle O2 uptake (mVO2)] could be varied independently. Simulation results demonstrated that 1) the rise in pVO2 during exercise contains three phases; 2) the contribution of changes in venous O2 stores to pVO2 kinetics and the O2 deficit occur almost entirely in phase 1; 3) under a wide variety of manipulations, the kinetics of pVO2 in phase 2 were within a couple of seconds of that assigned to mVO2 (i.e., there is not an obligatory slowing of VO2 kinetics at the lungs relative to those at the muscles; 4) by use of available estimates of blood flow adjustment, O2 delivery would not limit mVO2 after exercise onset; and 5) blood flow could limit O2 delivery in recovery, if blood flow returned to base-line levels at rates similar to those during the on-transient phase.\r"

Evidence of neurological compromise, particularly loss of consciousness, has been implicated as a marker for increased mortality and morbidity in clinical reports. Experiments were carried out with rats to assess whether CO exposure may cause brain lipid peroxidation. With the use of two methods, measurement of conjugated dienes and thiobarbituric acid reactivity, brain lipid peroxidation could be documented as a result of exposure to CO at a concentration sufficient to cause unconsciousness. Products of lipid peroxidation were increased by 75% over the base-line values 90 min after CO exposure. Unconsciousness was associated with a brief period of hypotension, so brief that in itself it caused no apparent insult. Lipid peroxidation occurred only after the animals were returned to CO-free air, and there was no direct correlation with the carboxyhemoglobin level. This work may provide an explanation for a number of currently poorly understood clinical observations regarding CO poisoning.\r"

The presence of stress fractures was confirmed histologically in some cases.

Microscopic damage was evident at the sites of positive bone scans. The progression, location, and time of onset of stress fractures in this animal model were similar to those in clinical reports, making the model a useful one for the study of the aetiology of stress fractures.\r"

In the remaining 10 patients no fracture could be detected; only one patient had a hip joint effusion but no free fat. Thus all 24 patients with lipohaemarthrosis had an intracapsular fracture of the hip. We suggest CT for patients with hip trauma and negative radiographs. The presence of a lipohaemarthrosis of the hip strongly suggests an intra-articular fracture of either the femoral neck or the acetabulum.\r"

We found a high rate of radiological loosening of the cup after the sixth year, and a high rate of clinical loosening after the eighth year. Loosening was commoner in women, in younger patients and where a smaller size of acetabulum had been used. Calcar resorption was significantly related to loosening of the acetabulum. Loosening appeared to be mainly due to polyethylene debris produced by micro-movement of the acetabulum against the bone, which had resulted in a giant cell foreign body reaction and subsequent bone erosion. We have abandoned the use of this prosthesis and suggest that direct contact between bone and polyethylene should be prevented by a coating of metal or some other material.\r"

This is most pronounced during activities such as stair climbing or getting up from a chair. Our study compares the immediate fixation of three stems in widespread clinical use, using a cadaver test simulation in which the femur was horizontal, and cyclic forces acted vertically downward on the prosthetic head with gradual increments of load. We implanted and tested 18 pairs of femurs, making analyses between stem types by right to left comparisons. We found no statistically significant differences in loosening between cementless AML and PCA prostheses, but cemented stems withstood greater loads than uncemented stems by a factor of five or more.\r"

A fixator is secured to the metaphysis of the femur, and its two malleable prongs encompass the trochanter fragment and stabilise it using the tension band principle. The fixator is versatile, simple to apply and has better mechanical properties than any technique using wires. We reviewed 49 revisions after a mean follow-up of 40 months. Patients had been mobilised early, but there were no detachments or displacements from the initial postoperative position. Although 31% of patients were osteoporotic and 16% had poor trochanter fragments, there was bony union in 46 of the 49 hips, the remaining three developing stable fibrous union.\r"

With the next 119 sockets, 111 of which were flanged, the eburnated and subchondral bone was preserved and multiple small anchor holes were used. The modified technique and the use of flanged sockets significantly improved the late radiological findings as regards socket demarcation and wear. On the femoral side, the intramedullary canal filling ratio, the distal packing of cement, calcar resorption and atrophy of the femoral cortex were correlated with prosthetic subsidence.\r"

Spinal anaesthesia reduced cancellous bleeding by an average of 44%, local freezing saline by 24%. Saline at room temperature, adrenaline solution and hydrogen peroxide each reduced it by 14%. The effects of spinal anaesthesia and of freezing saline were additive: used together they reduced bleeding by 56%. The reduction of blood contamination of cement and its interfaces should contribute to better prosthetic fixation.\r"

Evidence of bicipital tendonitis was found in two. Pain with loss of range of movement and a positive impingement sign was the most reliable clinical indicator of a cuff tear. Joint incongruity and superior migration of the humeral head were the best radiographic indicators. Rotator cuff tears are a common component of haemophilic arthropathy of the shoulder.\r"

The five-stage classification of Adams, Dolan and Hutton (1986) showed increased degeneration in the lower lumbar discs and more degenerative changes in men than in women. Exact reproduction of the patient's pain on injection was more common in fissured or ruptured discs than in less degenerate discs, with 81% sensitivity and 64% specificity of the discogram for pain. The additional information obtained by comparing computerised tomography (CT) with discograms was minimal. Discography was found to be useful in the evaluation of chronic low back pain in patients whose ordinary CT scans, myelograms and flexion-extension radiographs were normal. In spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis, discography can disclose whether fusion needs to be extended above the lytic level, and it may show if the pain in patients who have had posterolateral fusion is discogenic. Thus, discography gives information which is useful in deciding whether to operate on patients with chronic low back pain.\r"

After 5 months of implantation, all the arterial substitutes were patent. The analyses gave the following results: 1. The haematologic parameters were not affected by the grafts. 2. Light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicate a thrombotic accumulation and the presence of inflammatory cells in the compatible and the incompatible allografts. The occurrence of pathological changes was more pronounced in the incompatible group. 3. Immunostaining of anti-factor VIII-related antigen reveals a better preservation of the endothelial cell wall on the autograft. 4. The 6-keto-PGF1 alpha/TXB2 ratios of the autografts and the compatible allografts were similar.\r"

  ".W": "The long-term results of carotid endarterectomy are controversial. Here we report the late results of 44 surgically and 40 non-surgically treated patients with carotid stenosis documented by angiography in 1974-1976. The groups were similar with respect to sex-distribution, age, length of follow-up time (median 123.0 and 130.0 months in the surgical and non-surgical groups, respectively) and the occurrence of risk factors. Hypertension was more frequent (p less than 0.05) in the surgical group, as was medical treatment, mostly anticoagulants (p less than 0.06). The angiographic findings were also more severe in this group (p less than 0.001). During the follow-up period the occurrence of cerebrovascular complications (death, stroke and/or TIA) was more frequent in the nonoperated than in the operated group; however, survival of the patients was similar, as the cardiovascular deaths were an equalizing factor. The quality of life in patients alive examined for clinical and neurologic status and by neuropsychological tests and interview was similar, except that the operated patients were more satisfied. The progression of atherosclerosis in the carotid artery assessed by Duplex scanning was more frequent in the nonoperated group. Differences in medical treatment did not explain the results. Thus it is concluded that the late results were better in the operated patients with carotid stenosis than in the nonoperated ones.\r"

The indication for surgery was transient ischemic attack in 67.4%, stroke in 22.7% and asymptomatic carotid stenosis in 10.0% of the operations. The overall major cerebral complication rate attending the operation was 9.6%. During the last four years' period from 1981 to 1984 the procedure morbidity was 3.6% and there was no mortality. Postoperative complications comprised 31 ipsilateral strokes and one contralateral stroke; the complications occurred during the first 24 hours in 28 cases and on the fourth or fifth day in four cases. Of these patients 11 succumbed to internal carotid thrombosis, one to cerebral infarction without thrombosis and one to intracerebral hemorrhage. The associated factors for major complications were analyzed retrospectively in the light of 32 parameters. Patients of advanced age, patients with type II diabetes mellitus, elevated serum triglycerides, high-grade stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery, negative smoking history and those undergoing a second operation proved to be at high risk of early postoperative cerebral complications. These complications can be reduced by intraoperative use of heparin, preoperative ASA treatment and a short clamping time. Also peroperative use of shunt is obviously of benefit.\r"

Sixty-eight extremities in 34 normal volunteers and 21 extremities in 17 patients with chronic venous stasis and phlebographically demonstrated obstruction of their deep veins (popliteal-superficial femoral in 33.3%, common femoral in 23.8%, iliac in 33.3% and inferior vena cava in 9.5%) were evaluated using mercury in silastic strain gauges on the feet to measure venous volume changes on elevation and exercise. Regurgitant flow, corrected for arterial foot blood flow, was calculated. In the control group, the apparent regurgitation range was 0 to 2.3 ml %/min (mean +/- 2 SD). Sixty-two percent of extremities with obstructed deep veins had significant functional regurgitation. Regurgitation was detected by phlebography in only 14.3% of cases. From these results we conclude that obstruction of the deep venous system by phlebography may or may not signify functional obstruction and, in itself, therefore, does not indicate that bypass surgery is an appropriate method of treatment. Selection for surgical correction requires quantitative determination of insufficiency since higher grades of regurgitation probably contraindicate venous bypass.\r"

Although the pathogenesis of this complication is far from clear, the possible role of a short graft in determining traction and finally an angulation of the donor artery is hypothesized. The exact correspondence existing between the length of the AXB and the body size could be altered during the postoperative period by an excessive increase in body weight. The graft could become relatively short for the new conformation and angulation of the axillary artery could be provocated. On the basis of our experience and in reviewing the literature, we believe that an occluded AXB still represents a risk for the donor artery that must be carefully evaluated during accurate follow-up of the patient.\r"

Carotid pseudoaneurysm formation is a rare complication of internal jugular vein cannulation, and there has been no report of its formation after apparently successful jugular vein cannulation. This complication is difficult to predict, and careful observation after removal of the catheter is mandatory.\r"

  ".W": "Postoperative adhesions following open heart surgery enhance the risks and increase the time of subsequent reoperation. When possible, primary closure of the natural pericardium is recommended, particularly in those cases that are more likely to be reoperated upon. The use of a total artificial heart (TAH) as a bridge to transplantation makes reoperation mandatory. If the pleura is left open to accommodate the ventricles, the risk of adhesion is considerable. To address this question, gluteraldehyde-fixed pericardial allografts were evaluated in calves undergoing TAH replacement. Eight animals were implanted with 3 different types of TAHs and survived from 12 to 108 days (mean 52.8 +/- 14.5). The pericardial substitute was wrapped around the TAH and the vascular grafts and cuffs. Two different surgical techniques were evaluated. At the time of autopsy, the presence of adhesions and gross epicardial reaction was macroscopically characterized and classified according to a standardized scale. Bacterial cultures were taken and tissue submitted for histology. The animals implanted with pericardial allografts for periods greater than 3 weeks were observed to have greater adhesions than those implanted for periods less than 3 weeks (p = 0.006). Pericardial cultures were negative in all cases and neovascularization and fibroplasia of the underlying tissues occurred in all cases. Leukocyte infiltration was minimal in the shorter term implant animals. Degeneration of a portion of the pericardium occurred in only 2 cases after 90 days. Minor calcification of the artificial pericardium was noted, but only in the longer term implant animals. The artificial pericardium reduced adhesion, thus facilitating reoperation in implants lasting up to a month.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

To this purpose we reviewed the records of all adult patients consecutively operated upon in our Department for isolated chronic AI, from 1979 to 1985. Patients with associated cardiac disease, transvalvular aortic gradient, recent endocarditis of a malfunctioning bioprosthesis were excluded from the study, leaving 89 consecutive patients (mean age 47.2 years) for evaluation. St. Jude or Duromedics mechanical prostheses were exclusively used for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Post-operatively all patients received long term anticoagulation. Follow up period ranged from 24 to 109 months (mean 61.8 months). The method of analysis was designed as follows: a) each patient was allocated a positive (+) or a negative (-) variable for the value of each parameter, b) five patient groups were formed on the basis of the free association of parameter variables, c) single variables and their association with early and late mortality, functional results as NYHA Class were compared by statistical methods (chi 2, Student's Test, Wilcoxon Test). The results of the study show: a) only EF significantly influenced early mortality (P less than 0.05), b) late mortality was significantly influenced (P less than 0.001) by NYHA Class and CTR, c) single parameter variables (+ or -) and or their association significantly conditioned functional results.\r"

A total of 202 consecutive patients who underwent CABG operation in 1981 were reviewed 5 years later. Most of the patients (76.5%) had 3-vessel disease, previous AMI (70.2%), hypertriglyceridemia (61.7%), positive family history of CAD (68.0%) elevated blood cholesterol level (48.1%), hypertension (41.9%) or were smokers (61.9%). In 48.1% of the cases IMA was used for revascularization and in the rest saphenous vein graft alone. The 5-year survival of the entire group was 87%. The late mortality was related to 3 independent variables in multivariate analysis: 1) positive family history of CAD (p less than 0.05), 2) preoperative ejection fraction less than 0.30 (p less than 0.01) and 3) revascularization without IMA (p less than 0.02). The vast majority of patients (70%) had a better NYHA class 5 years postoperatively (the 95% confidence interval was 65-77%). These patients had experienced an average improvement of 2.0 NYHA categories. Eight per cent of patients had an unaltered and 5% a worse NYHA class than preoperatively. When the patients were grouped into those having a better NYHA class and into those who had an unchanged or worse NYHA class or who had died from CAD the only variable which was associated with poorer outcome appeared to be positive family history of CAD (p less than 0.01). It can be concluded that hereditary factors, utilization of internal mammary artery in revascularization and preoperative ejection fraction are the major predictors of late outcome after CABG.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical, biochemical, and haematological aspects of a recent outbreak of lead poisoning, in which exposure was related to the oxyacetylene cutting of red lead painted ironwork, were investigated. Initial suspicion was raised when a blood film showed punctate basophilia which remains a simple and useful method of picking up lead toxicity. Estimations of blood lead concentration and conventional laboratory data confirmed the diagnosis. Although there was prominent punctate basophilia, spectrophotometric analysis showed only negligible accumulation of pyrimidine-5'-nucleotides despite severe suppression of pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase activity. The pattern of the red cell glycolytic intermediates, investigated for the first time, suggested that lead may also affect glycolysis at the hexokinase step. Once the diagnosis was made intravenous chelation treatment was begun with a rapid improvement in symptoms. Long term follow up is required to assess any sequelae of intoxication. These cases emphasise the classic features of lead poisoning, and despite the currently available diagnostic tests, lead intoxication may still go unrecognised unless a thorough occupational history is taken.\r"

  ".W": "A survey of the incidence of monocyte esterase deficiency in 4000 inpatients (including 808 with malignant neoplastic disease) and 474 normal controls was performed using an automated esterase method. A highly significant excess of patients with malignant disease and the deficiency was evident when compared with normal controls or all other patients. Within the group of patients with malignant disease the demonstrable excess occurred in B chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma, and carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract. There was also a significant excess of patients with the deficiency attending the renal unit, both among patients who had had renal transplants and those who had not. A familial incidence of monocyte esterase deficiency was found in 19 (35%) of first degree relatives of those patients in whom family studies were done. It is suggested that the reason for the increased prevalence of the anomaly in these disorders might be that the diminution of esterase activity has a role in their development.\r"

Four such tumours were examined for evidence of metaplastic transition from carcinoma to sarcoma using morphology and reticulin stains. Consecutive sections were stained immunohistochemically using cytokeratin and vimentin to determine whether cells at the interface between carcinoma and sarcoma expressed both cytokeratin and vimentin. There was no evidence of morphological, architectural, or immunohistochemical transitions from carcinoma to sarcoma in the four tumours studied. This suggests that ovarian malignant mixed mesodermal tumours are not metaplastic carcinomas but are composed of histogenetically different elements.\r"

Similar, albeit generally milder, changes were found in 47 of 316 (15%) non-surgical patients undergoing endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms. To relate these changes to bile reflux or other potential gastric irritants the total bile acid concentration was measured in samples of fasting gastric juice, and the use of a symptom questionnaire ascertained the patients' cigarette consumption, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and alcohol intake. When patients with reflux gastritis were compared with normal controls (n = 91), significant increases in associated peptic ulceration and NSAID use were found in the group with reflux, but no increases in bile acid concentrations. Indeed, only one patient had evidence of duodenogastric reflux. It is concluded that most cases of \"reflux gastritis\" in the intact stomach are not due to reflux of bile. Our findings indicate an important pathogenic role for long term NSAID use, in what might be usefully termed type C or \"chemical\" gastritis.\r"

In normal small bowel VLA-1 was expressed on crypt epithelial cells and only weakly or not at all on surface epithelium. VLA-1 was again expressed weakly in normal colon, except in one case, a 1 year old child with diarrhoea but no histological abnormalities. In small and large intestine affected with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or indeterminate colitis, there was increased expression of VLA-1 on the basolateral aspects of crypt cells and de novo expression on surface epithelium. It is suggested that this is an adaptive response to prevent epithelial cell loss as a result of inflammation in the underlying lamina propria.\r"

This study was undertaken to assess whether this approach could be extended to fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy specimens which are becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of lymphoma. In 21 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma the rate of tumour proliferation estimated by Ki-67 immunostaining of FNA material, obtained from surgically removed specimens, was compared with that obtained on tissue biopsy. The correlation between both preparations was excellent, indicating that FNA biopsy material is suitable for the immunocytochemical assessment of the growth fraction of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\r"

Major areas of concern are the methods used for labelling subsets and the choice of appropriate monoclonal antibodies. A standard dual colour manual whole blood lysis technique for flow cytometry was compared with the recently available Coulter Q-Prep EPICS technique. Overall, there was no significant difference (Student's t test) between the use of anticoagulated blood treated with heparin or EDTA. When normal subjects were examined there was a decrease in the absolute number of CD3+ and Leu-7+/CD8- cells and an increase in CD19+ and CD20+ cells. When human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive subjects were examined there was a significant decrease in the absolute number of CD2+, CD3+, CD4+ and Leu 7+/CD8- cells and an absolute increase in CD19+ and CD20+ cells. CD8+ cells were decreased only with the Cyto-Stat reagents. Occasionally, the Q-Prep did not lyse the red cells efficiently. While the Q-Prep EPICS system has the potential to standardise and automate the labelling procedures used in lymphocyte subset analysis, further refinement, such as the choice of monoclonal antibodies or alternative preparative reagents, may be required to resolve the cause of the discordant findings between the two approaches.\r"

Neutrophil bipolar shape formation (BSF) was also simultaneously assessed with a Boyden chamber-based neutrophil migration assay. Both assays were precise and relatively reproducible; the average coefficient of variation for the BSF assay was 9.6% and 9.2% for the migration assay. In a blind study the BSF assay showed 100% sensitivity at detecting subjects with known abnormal neutrophil migration. Unlike the migration assay, the BSF assay does not require isolated neutrophils, reducing possible cell activation and monitoring the cell response under more physiological conditions. Small blood samples--1 ml or less compared with 20-40 ml for the migration assay--are used, and the method is technically simple. Results are available within 40 minutes, and routine (EDTA) blood samples are used. It is concluded that the BSF assay is a suitable motility screening test for both the clinical and pharmacological examination of the movement of polymorphonuclear leucocytes.\r"

The polyethylene oxide dressing provided an excellent matrix for the release of aloe vera gel during the initial 5 days of wound healing. By 24-48 hours there was dramatic vasoconstriction and accompanying reduction in edema on the aloe-treated side. By the third to fourth day there was less exudate and crusting at the aloe site, and by the fifth to sixth day the reepithelialization at the aloe site was complete. Overall, wound healing was approximately 72 hours faster at the aloe site. This acceleration in wound healing is important to reduce bacterial contamination, subsequent keloid formation, and/or pigmentary changes. The exact mechanism of acceleration of wound healing by aloe vera is unknown.\r"

  ".W": "We have recently developed a mAb, anti-1F7, which defines a family of structures found to include the molecule recognized by anti-Ta1 (CD26). In this paper, we demonstrated that binding of 1F7 by solid-phase immobilized anti-1F7 mAb but not anti-Ta1 mAb has a comitogenic effect by inducing proliferation of human CD4+ T lymphocytes in conjunction with submitogenic doses of anti-CD3 or anti-CD2. The proliferative response induced via the CD3-1F7 or CD2-1F7 pathways is associated with the IL-2 autocrine pathway, including IL-2 production. IL-2R expression and anti-IL-2R (Tac) inhibition. Furthermore, solid-phase immobilization of anti-1F7 but not anti-Ta1 acts in conjunction with submitogenic doses of PMA to mediate a comitogenic effect in the absence of anti-CD3 or anti-CD2, leading to CD4+ T cell proliferation. PMA treatment, in the meantime, leads to enhanced expression of 1F7 on the T cell surface. Despite its functional association with both pathways of activation, however, the 1F7 structure is not comodulated with the CD3/TCR complex nor the CD2 molecule. These findings thus suggest that the CD26 Ag is involved in CD3 and CD2-induced human CD4+ T cell activation.\r"

  ".W": "Theoretical considerations suggest that external forces play a significant role in cell-cell conjugate formation and may lead to the misinterpretation of adhesion data. To test this, the stability of conjugates formed between CTL and fibroblast target cells (TC) was examined in the controlled shear environment of a parallel plate flow chamber. Murine fibroblast targets expressing class I maternally transmitted Ag Mtaa or Mtab were grown on a glass slide that formed one wall of the flow chamber and were used in conjunction with anti-Mtaa and anti-Mtab specific mouse CTL clones to establish a panel of Ag-reciprocal targets and lymphocytes. Although cytolysis assays indicated that lymphocytes recognized and destroyed appropriate but not inappropriate targets, the stability of some CTL/TC conjugates was Ag independent. In all cases, the conjugate stability was shear dependent over a 100-fold range (0.04 to 4.0 dynes/cm2). For some clones, the ratio of the stabilities of Ag-specific CTL/TC conjugates to nonspecific conjugates was significantly enhanced with increasing shear. This implies that the role of Ag specificity in CTL/TC adhesion may be misinterpreted if the shear environment of CTL/TC conjugates is unknown or uncontrolled. Kinetic analysis revealed that conjugate stability was dependent on the exposure time to external forces and that there existed two populations of conjugates; weak associations that disengaged within the first 30 s of flow, and strong associations that remained attached even after a 5-min exposure to a steady shear stress. The stability of Ag-specific CTL/TC conjugates at 0.04 dynes/cm2 was enhanced by 50% as the temperature was increased from 25 to 37 degrees C, whereas the stability of nonspecific CTL/TC associations was not affected. This result indicates that significant Ag-specific strengthening may occur at physiologic temperatures. This work suggests the importance of attention to role of fluid mechanical shear stress in standard adhesion assays.\r"

However, the reduced alloreactivities as assessed by Th cell capacities (proliferative responses and IL-2 production) were recovered around 8 wk after the i.v. presensitization in euthymic B6 mice. In contrast, background levels of bm1- or bm12-specific reactivities were revealed to last more than 12 wk after the presensitization in B6 mice which had been thymectomized prior to the i.v. presensitization. Such a reduced alloreactivity was also observed in the capacity to reject bm1 or bm12 skin grafts, and prolongation of graft survival was strikingly enhanced in the thymectomized group compared to that induced in the nonthymectomized group. However, there was an important difference in such prolongation in the thymectomized hosts between bm1 and bm12 grafts; a considerable percentage (greater than 80%) of bm12 skin grafts continued to take more than 5 mo, whereas about 90% of bm1 grafts were rejected by around 5 mo along with the emergence of weak, but detectable anti-bm1 Th and cytotoxic T cell activities. These results indicate that 1) i.v. presensitization regimen is capable of eliminating in vitro and in vivo alloreactive capabilities but these alloreactivities can be recovered in euthymic hosts with T cell repopulating potential and 2) there are differential requirements of the thymus for repopulating anti-bm1 (Lyt-2+) and anti-bm12 (L3T4+) T cell activities.\r"

However, the capacity of a thymus-dependent (TD) Ag to mediate B cell signal transduction has been less well documented. Therefore, we examined Ag-induced intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]) in B cells by using TD Ag that would be expected to either cross-link or not cross-link sIgM and/or induce the coupling of sIgM to FcR. Stimulation of mouse TA3 hybridoma B cell transfectants that express the SP6 anti-TNP specific sIgM with either TNP-OVA or anti-IgM antibodies resulted in a maximal fourfold increase in [Ca2+]i. The net increase in [Ca2+]i in response to TNP-OVA was dependent upon both the Ag dose and the TNP:OVA molar ratio. Because occupancy of several cell-surface receptor types leads to a loss of response to subsequent stimulation by ligand (homologous desensitization), we examined the ability of Ag to induce homologous desensitization of sIgM in these B cells. TNP1-OVA at all concentrations tested (up to 500 micrograms/ml) did not lead to any change in [Ca2+]i or desensitization. Cross-linking of TNP1-OVA (10 micrograms/ml) with F(ab')2 of anti-OVA antibody induced both a rise in [Ca2+]i and homologous desensitization of sIg, suggesting that cross-linking of sIgM by Ag is sufficient to induce both these processes. TNP6-OVA at a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml induced changes in [Ca2+]i and partially desensitized TNP-specific B cells to stimulation by anti-IgM. Interestingly, a high dose (180 micrograms/ml) of TNP6-OVA stimulated minimal changes in [Ca2+]i yet did not lead to desensitization. However, cross-linking of TNP6-OVA at this high dose with F(ab')2 of rabbit anti-OVA elevated [Ca2+]i and elicited partial desensitization. Complete desensitization of sIgM by Ag was achieved when intact (Fc-containing) anti-OVA antibody was used, suggesting that the FcR can play a role in desensitization. Ag- and antibody-mediated desensitization was not caused by steric hindrance of sIg. Thus, we have observed two forms of Ag-induced desensitization of sIgM, both of which involve sIg cross-linking and one of which is mediated by the physiologic coupling of sIg to FcR.\r"

In our study, T cells were cultured with autologous monocytes in the presence of Con A for 6 days (primary cultures). At the end of the culture T cells were isolated and were 1) tested for surface DR expression and 2) treated with mitomycin C and placed in a secondary culture of allogeneic responder cells and Con A, to test their suppressor function. Treatment of monocytes of the primary culture with an anti-HLA-DR antibody abolished the expression of DR Ag on the T cells as well as their ability to function as Ts cells in the secondary culture. Monocytes from patients with active MS expressed low levels of surface DR Ag and induced reduced amounts of DR Ag on the surface of autologous T cells in primary cultures, which in turn expressed deficient suppressor function when placed in secondary cultures. In contrast, monocytes obtained from patients with inactive disease expressed higher levels of DR and induced higher amounts of DR Ag on autologous T cells, which expressed normal suppressor function. We conclude that the deficient expression of DR Ag on MS monocytes causes reduced suppressor function in activated autologous T cells and may be a primary abnormality in the immunopathogenesis of MS.\r"

  ".U": "90257332\r", 
  ".W": "Macrophages are major viral reservoirs in the brain, lungs, and lymph nodes of HIV-infected patients. But not all HIV isolates infect macrophages. The molecular basis for this restrictive target cell tropism and the mechanisms by which HIV infects macrophages are not well understood: virus uptake by CD4-dependent and -independent pathways have both been proposed. Soluble rCD4 (sCD4) binds with high affinity to gp 120, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV, and at relatively low concentrations (less than 1 microgram/ml) completely inhibits infection of many HIV strains in T cells or T cell lines. HTLV-IIIB infection of the H9 T cell line was completely inhibited by prior treatment of virus with 10 micrograms/ml sCD4: no p24 Ag or HIV-induced T cell syncytia were detected in cultures of H9 cells exposed to 1 x 10(4) TCID50 HTLV-IIIB in the presence of sCD4. Under identical conditions and at a 100-fold lower viral inoculum, 10 micrograms/ml sCD4 had little or no effect on infection of monocytes by any of six different HIV isolates by three different criteria: p24 Ag release, virus-induced cytopathic effects, and the frequency of infected cells that express HIV-specific mRNA. At 10- to 100-fold higher concentrations of sCD4, however, infection was completely inhibited. Monoclonal anti-CD4 also prevented infection of these same viral isolates in monocytes. The relative inefficiency of sCD4 for inhibition of HIV infection in monocytes was a property of the virion, not the target cell: HIV isolates that infect both monocytes and T cells required similarly high levels of sCD4 (100 to 200 micrograms/ml) for inhibition of infection. These data suggest that the gp120 of progeny HIV derived from macrophages interacts with sCD4 differently than that of virions derived from T cells. For both variants of HIV, however, the predominant mechanism of virus entry for infection is CD4-dependent.\r"

IL-4 binds specifically to a cell-surface receptor (IL-4R) on cells from a variety of lineages including T and B cells. In general both primary cells and in vitro cell lines express less than 5000 receptors per cell. Utilizing a subclone of the cytotoxic T cell line CTLL-2 expressing a high level of IL-4R, mAb against the murine IL-4R were prepared. Two mAb have been identified which have different properties. These antibodies, designated M1 and M2, recognize sequences specific to the murine IL-4R. Immunoprecipitation studies with M1 and M2 on CTLL-2 cells have identified the receptor as a Mr = 145,000 cell-surface protein. Similar results have been obtained with the recently isolated full length murine IL-4R cDNA expressed in COS-7 cells. In addition the antibodies are capable of inhibiting IL-4 binding. One antibody, M1, is also a potent inhibitor of IL-4-induced proliferation. These antibodies will be useful in dissecting a wide array of activities attributed to IL-4.\r"

Two mAb (H7 and T21) were selected for their competitive inhibition of receptor binding by 35S-labeled IL-5 and of IL-5 biologic activities. The number of binding sites recognized by the mAb on different cell lines correlated with IL-5 responsiveness. Most surface IgM+ peritoneal B cells were H7+ and more than 70% were also Ly-1(CD5)dull+, and responded to IL-5 for polyclonal IgM production in a high frequency. A significant proportion of splenic B cells reacted with these mAb, although lower number (one-log less) than peritoneal B cells and a small proportion of H7dull+ splenic B cells seems to be Ly-1(CD5)dull+, 1 of 200 splenic B cells responded to IL-5 for IgM production. These results suggest that IL-5R+ B cells may consist of a subpopulation of B cells. Intriguingly, lymphoid populations of bone marrow cells were stained with H7 and T21, whereas myeloid populations were brightly stained with only T21. Finally, both H7 and T21 mAb specifically precipitated a protein of a Mr 60,000 from 125I-labeled cell lysates of IL-5R+ T88-M cells. The IL-5R with similar size (Mr 55,000 to 60,000) was precipitated from the cell lysates of peritoneal B cells. T21 mAb but not H7 mAb precipitated a protein of a Mr 110,000 from the cell lysates of bone marrow cells.\r"

We have previously shown that multinucleated cells (MNC) with many features of the osteoclast phenotype form in long term human marrow cultures. Addition of rhIL-6 (10 to 100 pg/ml) to these cultures significantly increased MNC formation, with greater than 80% of the MNC expressing an Ag that cross-reacts with the mAb 23c6. This antibody preferentially binds to osteoclasts. rhIL-6 did not enhance MNC formation in marrow cultures treated with 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3, a potent stimulator of MNC formation, but significantly increased the percentage of MNC that cross-reacted with the 23c6 mAb. Addition of antihuman IL-1 to cultures treated with rhIL-6 totally inhibited the increase in MNC formation stimulated by rhIL-6. In contrast, anti-IL-1 did not affect MNC formation stimulated by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3. Further, conditioned media from marrow cultures exposed to rhIL-6 contained elevated levels of IL-1 beta (500 pg/ml compared to 23 pg/ml in control cultures 15 h after IL-6 addition). These results suggest that the capacity of rhIL-6 to stimulate formation of MNC which cross-react with 23c6 is mediated by induction of release of IL-1 beta.\r"

MEA was characterized as a glycoprotein with a Mr range between 37,000 and 43,000. Apparent homogeneity was obtained by using a four-step purification scheme including cation exchange chromatography, Procion red affinity chromatography, IEF, and gel filtration. Inasmuch as MEA was N-terminally blocked during automated Edman-degradation, peptide fragments after digestion with trypsin were used for partial amino acid sequence determination. All evaluable MEA peptide fragments showed complete sequence homology to a recently purified and cloned novel T cell growth factor (P40/TCGF III), the mouse homologue of human IL-9.\r"

In cultures of mitogen-stimulated PBMC, verapamil also blocked T cell accumulation of cytoplasmic IL-2-encoding mRNA. In sharp contrast, the addition of verapamil to PHA and PMA-stimulated PBMC augmented the mitogen-stimulated increases in nuclear transcription of IL-6-encoding mRNA, steady state levels of IL-6 encoding mRNA, and release of IL-6 bioactivity. These experiments indicated that an increased IL-6 transcriptional rate rather than stabilization of transcripts accounted for the increased cytoplasmic IL-6 mRNA levels and subsequent expression of IL-6 bioactivity. These effects were not produced by nicardipine, another potent calcium channel blocker, or EGTA. We suggest that a non-calcium-dependent, IL-6 regulatory factor, absent or inactive in verapamil-treated cultures, inhibits IL-6 gene activation in mitogen-stimulated PBMC. Failure to express this inhibitory factor would result in IL-6 gene superinduction at a transcriptional level.\r"

It has been proposed that this C3 molecule (iC3) plays a key role in initiation of the alternative pathway of the C system. However, its presence in plasma has never been demonstrated. We investigated the presence of iC3 in plasma, using mAb that recognize iC3 as well as C3 activation products but not native C3. One of these mAb, anti-C3-5, which binds iC3 via its C3a moiety, was used together with polyclonal 125I-anti-C3c to develop a RIA for iC3. Plasma incubated with methylamine yielded a strong response in this RIA, whereas neither fresh plasma nor serum in which the C system had been activated by incubation with aggregated IgG, did show this strong response. The specificity of this RIA was further demonstrated by additional experiments including experiments with purified preparations of the various forms of C3. Mean level of iC3 in freshly obtained plasma samples from 10 normal donors was 27 nmol/liter, which is 0.49% of total C3. Analysis by SDS-PAGE of C3 species that had been immunoprecipitated by mAb antiC3-5, revealed that some iC3 consisted of C3 molecules with an intact alpha-chain whereas another part consisted of iC3 molecules with an alpha-chain that had been cleaved by factor I. Thus, this study shows that fresh human plasma contains a C3 species with the conformation of \"C3b-like C3\" (iC3).\r"

The Ab2 displayed the following internal image properties of Lol p I: it can be affinity-purified on an immobilized Id column; its binding to the anti-Lol p I mAb (290A-167) is inhibited by Lol p I; it inhibits in a dose-response fashion the binding of the specific Id to Ag. It is recognized by anti-Lol p I antisera from different species such as mouse, human, and goat. The Ab3 which binds to Lol p I was also produced from the same fusion. This binding was inhibited significantly by aId mAb (Ab2), anti-Lol p I mAb (290A-167) and Lol p I. These data indicate that the two mAb with specificity for Lol p I (290A-167 and Ab3) share similar reactivity to the Ag and that aId mAb is the internal image of the epitope recognized by the Id. We showed also that the capacity of rabbit aId Ab directed against the 290A-167 Id to inhibit the binding of Ab1 and Ab3 to Ag was almost abolished by passage over a Ab3-coated Sepharose column. This would suggest that not only are the two mAb with reactivity to Lol p I (Ab1 and Ab3) directed against identical epitopes, but that they in fact shared identical idiotopes as well. The production of identical mAb upon immunization with either the Ag or the aId mAb supports that the conceptual framework proposed by Jerne finds its biologic application in the course of an immune response.\r"

  ".W": "We have identified and characterized C3b binding proteins of two primates, orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla). Detergent solubilized 125I surface-labeled E and PBMC were subjected to affinity chromatography with homologous or human iC3/C3b. These ligands bound a 225,000 single chain protein from orangutan E and PBMC and a 220,000 protein from gorilla E. Proteins of the same Mr were immunoprecipitated by a rabbit polyclonal and two murine mAb to the human CR1 (CD35). The C3b binding protein of gorilla E aligned with that of the common human CR1 polymorphic size variant. Human or orangutan iC3 was also a ligand for a surface-labeled protein doublet of 59,000 and 65,000 from orangutan E. The doublet pattern and mol wts are similar to membrane cofactor protein (or CD46). Further, this doublet was immunoprecipitated by a mAb to human MCP. The MCP-like protein doublet was not isolated from gorilla or human E. Decay accelerating factor (DAF) of orangutan E was also identified and was structurally and antigenically distinct from the MCP-like protein. Orangutan or gorilla E preparations were a cofactor for the cleavage of human iC3 by human factor I and produced the same cleavage fragments as human CR1. Cofactor activity of orangutan E was partially inhibited by preclearance of CR1 and more completely inhibited by preclearance of MCP. Cofactor activity of gorilla E was inhibited by coincubation with a monoclonal antibody to human CR1. These data indicate that the orangutan and gorilla high m.w. proteins are equivalent to human CR1. The orangutan E membrane protein doublet with m.w. of 59,000 and 65,000 possesses biochemical, antigenic, and functional properties of human membrane cofactor protein.\r"

  ".U": "90257345\r", 
  ".W": "The factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b, using factor H as a cofactor was completely inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) when factor I and C3b were incubated with DFP before the addition of factor H. Inhibition, although to a lesser degree, was observed when factor H was present during DFP-exposure. No inhibition in factor I activity was seen when factor I and H were incubated with DFP either alone or together. It was also demonstrated that the 38-kDa subunit of factor I bound radiolabeled DFP when factor I and C3b together were exposed to DFP. These observations suggest that factor I interacts with C3b in a manner that exposes its catalytic site to DFP, an interaction that is independent of factor H. The inhibitory effect by DFP on factor I led us to further investigate the factor I cleavage products of iC3b, inasmuch as previous reports were ambiguous as to whether digestion occurs in the presence of DFP. Digestion of C3b bound to activated thiol Sepharose (ATS-C3b) in the presence of factor H at low pH and ionic strength and in serum by complement activation produced C3d,g-like fragments with apparent molecular mass of 41 and 43 kDa. These fragments were shown to have three different N-terminal and two different C-terminal ends. The major fragments had N-terminal sequences starting with Glu933, as shown by sequence determination. Traces of fragments extending beyond this point were also found, shown by Western blot analysis using a panel of mAb previously shown to bind to epitopes exposed within a region of C3 spanning residues 929 to 943, as well as a shorter fragment starting with Glu938. When digestion of C3b is carried out in the presence of DFP, the factor I level necessary for digestion is elevated and may explain how the first two cleavages producing iC3b but not the following giving C3d,g, can occur. The finding of several factor I cleavage sites in the C3d,g region of C3 demonstrates that factor I has a broad specificity, mainly for arginyl bonds. It has also been shown to digest a lysyl bond exposed in ATS-bound C3b.\r"

  ".W": "The H and L chain V region sequences of nine anti-DNA mAb that are representative of a pathogenic population of autoantibodies produced by the nephritis prone (SWR x NZB)F1 (SNF1) mice, were determined. These nine anti-DNA autoantibodies were idiotypically connected members of a cross-reactive Id family called the Id564 cluster. Moreover, these autoantibodies were all cationic in charge, IgG2b in isotype, and their H chain C regions had the normal SWR parent's allotype. Although derived from two different SNF1 animals, these pathogenic autoantibodies possessed highly homologous Leader-VH sequences that could account for their idiotypic cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the VH region sequences of these anti-DNA antibodies contained numerous basic residues that could impart their cationic charge. The Leader-VH sequences of these autoantibodies were also highly homologous to that of an anti-NP antibody-related germ-line gene of C57BL/6 mice, called VH-23. Among these nine pathogenic autoantibodies, three sets of clonally related anti-DNA antibodies could be identified. Thus the Id564 cluster of cationic anti-DNA autoantibodies of SNF1 mice are encoded by highly related VH genes, and this idiotypically connected population of pathogenic autoantibodies are selected to undergo an oligoclonal expansion in the lupus-prone SNF1 mice.\r"

One of the hybridomas, named S2B154, was shown with a number of serologic and immunochemical assays to mimic the specificity of anti HLA-DQw3 mAb KS13. This result was unexpected, because the antiidiotypic mAb had been classified as gamma because of the lack of detection of anti-HLA-DQw3 antibodies in sera from BALB/c mice immunized with the antiidiotypic mAb KO3-34. The antiidiotypic mAb S2B154, an IgG1, displays a lower affinity constant to HLA-DQw3 Ag-bearing lymphoid cells than mAb KS13, an IgG2b, but a higher one to antiidiotypic mAb KO3-34. Testing with a panel of antiidiotypic mAb elicited with the mAb KS13 showed that both antiidiotypic mAb S2B154 and mAb KS13 express in their Ag-combining site the idiotopes recognized by the antiidiotypic mAb KO3-256, KO3-335, and R1-38. However, the antiidiotypic mAb S2B154 does not react with the mAb R18-9 that recognizes an idiotope outside the Ag-combining site of mAb KS13. The results we have presented question the validity of the classification of antiidiotypic antibodies based on their ability to inhibit the binding of the corresponding antibodies to Ag and on the specificity of antisera elicited with antiidiotypic antibodies. Furthermore, the hybridomas we have developed in this Id cascade provide us the opportunity to analyze the structural basis of idiotypic Ag mimicry and to evaluate the regulatory properties of antiidiotypic antibodies in the immune response to HLA class II Ag.\r"

  ".W": "We have compared the oxidative response of alveolar macrophages (AM) during opsonin-dependent and independent phagocytosis by using multiparameter flow cytometry. The respiratory burst of AM during phagocytosis was quantitated by the intracellular oxidation of the nonfluorescent precursors dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH) or hydroethidine (HE, a reduced precursor of ethidium) to their fluorescent (oxidized) counterparts. After loading freshly isolated normal hamster AM with DCFH or HE, red or green fluorescent beads, respectively, were added to the shaking cell suspensions. Ingestion of opsonized particles by AM caused a marked increase in oxidation of both DCFH and HE proportional to the number of beads ingested. In contrast, uptake of one to three unopsonized particles per cell led to inhibition of oxidative activity compared to control cells incubated without particles. AM ingesting four or more unopsonized particles showed some increase in oxidative metabolism, but far less than that with identical numbers of particles in opsonin-dependent ingestion. Similar results were obtained using fluorescent labeled staphylococcal bacteria. Using three-color flow cytometry to study cells ingesting both types of particles, cells first ingesting unopsonized beads were also found to have an inhibited oxidative response to subsequently ingested opsonized particles. The mitochondrial poison antimycin inhibited most of the intracellular oxidative response to either type of phagocytosis. The remaining antimycin-insensitive, membrane derived respiratory burst of AM was also substantially diminished after phagocytosis of unopsonized particles vs similar numbers of opsonized particles. The greatly increased mitochondrial respiration in AM during phagocytosis of opsonized particles may be related to bactericidal mechanisms. Killing of ingested Staphylococcus by AM was markedly impaired in the presence of antimycin. The results suggest that AM may ingest the numerous, unopsonized inert particles that are inhaled without generation of potentially toxic oxygen metabolites, while retaining the capacity to undergo a respiratory burst after ingesting opsonized particles and bacteria. The mechanism(s) for this distinct response may include generation of an inhibitor of intracellular oxidative metabolism.\r"

The surface Ag of trophozoites reisolated from 6/6 volunteers differed from the inoculum. To determine if the surface Ag of trophozoites derived from clones would also change, volunteers were inoculated with two clones, B6 or H7. B6 possesses a 200-kDa surface Ag recognized by mAb 3F6 and H7 has a 72-kDa surface Ag recognized by mAb G10/4. One of thirteen B6 and four of four H7-inoculated volunteers became infected. Analysis of Giardia obtained on day 22 from the intestines of the four H7-infected volunteers and cultures derived from these trophozoites revealed loss of the initial major surface Ag as determined by surface IFA using mAb, surface radiolabeling and loss of cytotoxicity to mAb, and Western blots. Loss of the 72-kDa Ag began after day 14 and was practically complete by day 22. The 200-kDa surface Ag was almost totally absent from the surface of Giardia isolated from the single B6-infected volunteer. Serum surface-reactive antibodies, as measured by IFA and cytotoxicity to H7 and the day 22 isolates, showed high levels of antibodies to H7, primarily to the 72-kDa surface Ag, but negligible or low levels of late-appearing antibodies to the day 22 isolates. These studies document antigenic variation of Giardia in human infections and show that humoral responses are in part isolate-specific.\r"

  ".W": "Although NK cells can kill both malignant cells and virus-infected cells without prior sensitization, it has remained unclear whether the mechanism by which an NK cell is activated in the presence of a tumor cell is similar to that induced by the presence of a virus-infected cell. In our experimental system using homogeneous populations of cloned human CD16+ NK cells, we found that HSV-infected target cells do not induce in the NK cells the same pharmacologically-active second messengers elicited by NK-sensitive tumor cells. Although phosphoinositide turnover and calcium signaling were generated in NK cells exposed to NK-sensitive tumor cells, the recognition of HSV-infected cells by NK cells did not result in similar transmembrane signaling. Furthermore, depending on the cell type infected by HSV, alternative mechanisms of cytotoxicity were employed. HSV-infected foreskin fibroblasts were rapidly and selectively killed by cloned NK cells without a requirement for IFN or accessory cells. In contrast to this direct cytotoxicity against HSV-infected foreskin fibroblasts, NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against an HSV-infected fibrosarcoma cell line (1591) was dependent on IFN-alpha production by accessory cells. Importantly, in both systems of cytotoxicity, IFN-alpha activation of NK cells resulted in augmented killing against both infected and uninfected targets. These results suggest that NK cell activation induced during antiviral immunity is distinct from activation elicited during an antitumor response. These differences include the utilization of alternative forms of signal transduction and alternative mechanisms of cytotoxicity.\r"

  ".W": "alpha-1-Acid glycoprotein (AGP), which is produced in the mammalian liver and secreted into the blood-stream, is regulated by steroid hormones and by mediators of the acute phase response. In vitro transfection studies have shown that the response to glucocorticoids requires a cis-acting regulatory element, termed the glucocorticoid response element, that is located within 120 bp of the transcriptional start-site of the gene; induction by the acute phase mediators requires a different element, termed the distal regulatory element (DRE), that is located about 5 kb upstream of the start-site. To determine if these elements function in vivo, we have produced and characterized transgenic mice containing rat AGP gene constructs with and without the DRE. Five transgenic lines were produced from a 9.5-kb genomic AGP containing 4.7 kb of the 5' flanking region; this construct lacks the DRE. Another transgenic line was derived from a 10.7-kb clone that contains 5.3 kb of 5' flanking sequences including the DRE. All transgenic mice produced high levels of immunologically detectable rat AGP in the circulation, comparable to or in excess of that found in normal rats. There were correspondingly high concentrations of rat AGP transcripts in the liver. Transgene expression in all lines was induced in response to dexamethasone and during acute inflammation resulting from LPS treatment. The DRE-containing transgene underwent a greater induction in response to LPS than to dexamethasone; the transgene lacking the DRE responded similarly to both treatments. In cultured primary hepatocytes, the DRE-containing transgene was induced by the acute phase cytokines IL-1 and IL-6, and by dexamethasone, administered individually or in combination; the transgene lacking the DRE responded only to dexamethasone, and was not affected by the peptide hormones. Together, these results provide in vivo evidence supporting the notion that a minimum of two upstream sequences are responsible for the inflammatory induction of rat AGP. One element, which is located within the smaller 9.7-kb restriction fragment, is responsive to glucocorticoids and is likely to be the glucocorticoid response element located close to the transcriptional start site. The other element, the DRE, is located much further upstream and is responsible for imparting responsiveness to the acute phase cytokines.\r"

Analysis of class I MHC mRNA by in situ hybridization and class I MHC Ag by immunohistology has revealed two phenotypically distinct subpopulations of trophoblast cells in term placentas and extraplacental membranes. Trophoblast cells external to the placenta are mRNA +/Ag+. They contain class I mRNA and express class I Ag that differ serologically from HLA-A,B,C. In contrast, trophoblast cells forming the syncytial layer of placental villi are mRNA-/Ag-. By immunohistology, trophoblast cells in 1st trimester placental tissues are similar to those in term tissues. In our study, in situ hybridization was used to determine if patterns of trophoblast cell class I mRNA were the same or different. Trophoblast cells external to the placental villi in 1st trimester tissues contained class I mRNA as would be predicted from the results with term tissues. Unexpectedly, class I mRNA was found in villous trophoblast cells. Thus, these studies identified an mRNA+/Ag- trophoblast cell subpopulation. The results suggest that tissue-specific mechanisms may interfere with translation of class I mRNA in 1st trimester villous trophoblast cells and/or that the protein products of the mRNA are not identified by available mAb.\r"

We have constructed a cDNA library from monocytes adhered for 30 min on plastic and have screened it by differential hybridization for mRNA rapidly induced by adherence. Two of the cDNA isolated have been identified as IL-1 beta and superoxide dismutase. Sequence data from three other adherence specific clones demonstrates the presence of ATTTA mRNA instability sequences in their 3' untranslated regions signifying inflammation-associated genes. The deduced amino acid sequences indicate the presence of open reading frames with sequence homologies to a family of host defense cytokines, one of them being identified as IL-8. Of the 14 clones initially identified, 4 have been analyzed for induction of mRNA expression. Although 3 of the 4 clones were equally induced by PMA and LPS under nonadherent conditions, all 4 cDNA showed distinct patterns of induction with adherence to extracellular matrix components or endothelial cells. The deduced amino acid sequence homologies indicate that we have isolated cDNA that code for three unique gene products. These cDNA belong to a gene family of early host defense cytokines involved in inflammation and cell growth, but which are differentially regulated by adherence to different surfaces.\r"

  ".W": "A mAb, porcine NK-inhibitory mAb (PNK-I) that inhibits porcine NK activity without affecting antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) has been developed. PNK-I acts at the level of the effector cell and inhibition of NK activity is independent of complement. Inhibitory effects are seen against various human and murine NK-susceptible targets. Addition of PNK-I antibody up to 60 min after assay initiation was effective at inhibiting NK activity. Furthermore PNK-I does not inhibit E:T conjugation and inhibits during the Ca2(+)-dependent phase of NK cytolysis. PNK-I Ag is present on virtually all PBL showing a bimodal distribution with 74% \"dim\" and 15% \"bright\" by flow cytometry. Monocytes and granulocytes stain with an intermediate intensity with greater than 90% and 95% staining positively, respectively. F(ab')2 fragments of PNK-I antibody show identical staining and functional activity as the whole molecule indicating that PNK-I acts independently of FcR. PNK-I immunoprecipitates molecules of molecular mass of 166, 155, 95 kDa under reducing and nonreducing conditions. PNK-I appears to be recognizing an epitope on a CD18 molecule. The CD18 molecule (beta-chain of CD11a,b,c) is ubiquitous on the surface of leukocytes and is implicated in a variety of cellular functions. Dim and bright populations were sorted and assessed functionally for NK and ADCC activity. It is demonstrated that PNK-I+ bright lymphocytes contain all detectable NK and ADCC activity in porcine PBL. Furthermore PNK-I+ bright lymphocytes contain the cytokine responsive NK cells capable of stimulation by IL-2, porcine NK-activating factor, and porcine natural killer-enhancing mAb. PNK-I+ dim cells were devoid of all baseline as well as inducible NK and ADCC activity. Giemsa stain of sorted populations show PNK-I+ bright cells containing the large granular lymphocytes whereas dim are devoid of these. Two color analysis show that PT4+ cells are PNK-I+ dim whereas PT8+ lymphocytes are divided between PNK-I+ bright and dim populations. Our results indicate that we are able to isolate all active as well as inducible NK and ADCC effector cells from porcine PBL based on relative Ag expression of CD18. Therefore quantitative as well as qualitative antigen expression is important in NK/ADCC-mediated cytotoxicity.\r"

NK cell maturation represents an important site for regulation of the level of NK activity and constitutes a potentially interesting target for therapeutic intervention. The effect of the immunomodulator Linomide (carboxamide-3-quinoline) on the regeneration of NK cells was studied in vivo after depletion of mature NK cells. Linomide significantly, although to various extent, accelerated the maturation of NK cells after specific depletion with antibodies to asialomonoganglioside, treatment with cyclophosphamide or lethal irradiation and syngeneic bone marrow grafting. Examination of the target cell spectrum lysed by spleen effector cells during Linomide treatment as well as studies of phenotype, clearly indicated that the effector cells studied were NK cells. Treatment of mice for 4 days with Linomide increased the frequency of bone marrow NK cell progenitors from 1/11,900 to 1/6,000 as judged by limiting dilution analysis. Direct addition of Linomide in vitro had no effect on cultures of mature NK cells from spleen, but had an additive effect to IL-2 on the generation of NK cells when added to bone marrow cultures. Our study indicates that different mechanisms exist for the regulation of progenitor and mature NK cells, and that the immunomodulator Linomide represent a potentially important tool for investigating the mechanisms governing NK cell maturation.\r"

  ".W": "Endothelium regulates smooth muscle tone in response to various agonists and antagonists by release of vasorelaxing and vasoconstricting factors. It also has been postulated that superoxide radicals, which degrade endothelium-derived relaxing factor, exert smooth muscle-constrictor effects. To determine the role of superoxide radicals on vasomotor tone, we exposed rat thoracic aortic rings in vitro to a superoxide radical-generating system of xanthine and xanthine oxidase (X + XO). In rings with intact endothelium, X + XO caused modest smooth muscle contraction and increased vascular sensitivity to both l-epinephrine and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) \"mimic\" U46619. These vascular contractile effects were more pronounced in rings without intact endothelium. In the supernates of vascular rings with intact endothelium, TxA2 and prostacyclin metabolites were identified on exposure of vascular rings to X + XO, indicating stimulation of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Although both superoxide radical scavenger superoxide dismutase and cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin blocked release of TxA2 and prostacyclin, only superoxide dismutase blocked the contractile effects of superoxide radicals (p less than 0.05). Neither catalase nor mannitol had any effect on X + XO mediated vasoconstriction, suggesting that hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals did not participate in the observed effects of X + XO. Exposure of vascular rings to X + XO revealed extensive endothelial disruption as determined by scanning electron microscopy. Thus superoxide radicals exert procontractile effects on vascular smooth muscle and enhance its response to l-epinephrine and TxA2 mimic. These effects are probably exerted by injury to the endothelial barrier.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Sympathicotonic orthostatic intolerance (hypotension, tachycardia, or both) is associated with normal or excessive orthostatic increases in plasma norepinephrine concentration and is reversible by the inflation of a military anti-shock trouser suit enveloping the lower limbs and abdomen. These facts suggest that one possible mechanism of the disorder might be a defect in alpha-adrenergic receptor or postreceptor responsiveness of the veins or arterioles. We have investigated in 11 patients and 15 healthy controls the blood pressure and heart rate responses to increasing rates of intravenous norepinephrine infusion (1 to 16 micrograms/min), the dorsal hand vein contractile responses to increasing rates of norepinephrine infusion (1 to 256 ng/min) with a linear variable differential transformer, and the platelet alpha 2-adrenergic receptor densities and dissociation constants. No statistically significant difference in any of these parameters was found between the normal subjects and nine of the 11 patients with orthostatic intolerance. The venous contractile response to norepinephrine was excessive in one patient and was virtually absent in another. Because supersensitivity of the hand veins to norepinephrine suggests up-regulation of alpha 2-receptors resulting from postganglionic autonomic insufficiency, this finding in one patient with sympathicotonic orthostatic hypotension might have been caused by venous denervation. The venous unresponsiveness to norepinephrine in the other patient presumably resulted from a defect in the venous receptors or smooth muscle function. It is evident that norepinephrine responsiveness and the innervation of the arterioles and hand veins was normal in the other nine patients, in whom the defect must have been mediated by some other mechanism.\r"

All infants underwent extended intraesophageal pH monitoring for 16 to 24 hours as well as gastroesophageal scintigraphy with technetium 99m sulfur colloid to study the correlation between the two tests. Forty-eight infants exhibited reflux with extended pH monitoring whereas 46 infants showed reflux with scintigraphy. However, the diagnosis of reflux in individual patients by extended pH monitoring corresponded poorly with the diagnosis of reflux in the same patients by scintigraphy. Similarly, no correlation was observed between extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy results, whether expressed as percent gastric emptying or as gastroesophageal reflux ratio. We conclude that extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy measure different pathophysiologic phenomena and detect reflux under different conditions. The ability of these tests to detect reflux may be complementary and they may be of greatest value when used together to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic evaluation. Extended pH monitoring and scintigraphy should not be used interchangeably to monitor gastroesophageal reflux.\r"

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to assess how brief periods of intermittent reperfusion (IR) imposed during a renal ischemic insult affect adenine nucleotide/catabolite concentrations, oxidant stress, and the severity of ischemic acute renal failure (IARF). Rats were subjected to 35 minutes of renal pedicle occlusion with or without brief IR periods (total less than or equal to 3 minutes). Adenine nucleotides and their catabolites were measured at the end of ischemia and at 30 minutes of the recovery period. Oxidant stress in the recovery phase was assessed by non-protein-bound sulfhydryl and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations. The severity of IARF was quantified at 24 hours by degrees of azotemia and histologic damage. Although IR had no significant impact on end-ischemic ATP concentrations, it did induce profound adenine nucleotide catabolite depletion; the sum of adenosine, inosine, inosine monophosphate, hypoxanthine, and xanthine fell by 78%, compared with control ischemia values (p less than 0.001). The pattern of IR affected the degree of catabolite depletion: dividing a single 3-minute IR period into two 1 1/2-minute segments increased catabolite loss by 45% without affecting adenine nucleotide content. Although adenine nucleotide catabolites can be resynthesized to ATP, IR did not worsen postischemic adenine nucleotide recovery. IR augmented postischemic sulfhydryl depletion by 8% (p less than 0.02). However, lipid peroxidation (as assessed by MDA) did not result and the severity of IARF was not adversely affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "To examine whether the intestinal mucosa in uremia is more prone to injury, we studied acute intestinal mucosal injury in rats with experimental chronic renal failure (RF) and sham-operated and starved control animals. Intestinal injury was produced by perfusing intestinal segments in vivo with 5 mmol/L chenodeoxycholic acid. Histologic specimens were then taken from the proximal and distal perfused and unperfused intestinal segments. Quantitative morphometry was done with computerized image analysis, and samples of the unperfused intestine were assayed for protein and DNA content. Chronic RF did not significantly affect the functional or morphologic injury caused by chenodeoxycholic acid. However, it was noted that RF rats had consistently taller villi and deeper crypts in all the samples studied. The protein content and the ratio of DNA to protein was similar among the three groups. The mechanism of the increase in villus height and crypt depth in the RF rats was not related to increases in tissue water content or to alterations in protein or DNA content, and the mechanism thus remains unexplained. This study clearly demonstrates, however, that the intestinal mucosa of rats with chronic renal insufficiency is not more susceptible to mucosal injury by bile acids than is the mucosa of appropriate control animals.\r"

In contrast, a recent assessment of a modified (diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked) hemoglobin (HbXL) solution found normal memory, learning, and brain histology after infusion of a clinically relevant dose of a 14% HbXL solution. The current study examined this potential resuscitation fluid for evidence of neurobehavioral toxicity under clinical conditions. Rats were trained to complete a water alley maze, had 50% of their total blood volume (30 ml/kg) withdrawn, were resuscitated with 14% HbXL solution (45 ml/kg), Ringer's lactate (60 ml/kg), or autologous shed blood, and were subsequently retested in the water maze. Rats resuscitated with HbXL or autologous shed blood survived resuscitation, while 20% of those resuscitated with Ringer's lactate died during treatment. No significant performance degradation was observed in the HbXL rats following resuscitation, and no brain pathology was observed at necropsy 10 days after treatment. Ischemic brain lesions were observed in three (25%) of the surviving rats resuscitated with Ringer's lactate solution. Renal tubule regeneration indicative of an earlier insult was observed in animals from all three groups. A significant correlation between the total pathology in the five organs examined and maze errors was observed (p less than 0.001). The survival, maze performance, and histology results suggest that resuscitation with 14% HbXL solution does not cause neurotoxicity, as assessed in this lethal hemorrhage model.\r"

Plasma free, sulfoconjugated, and glucuronoconjugated catecholamine concentrations were assessed in 15 patients with cirrhosis and in 15 age-matched control subjects. Plasma free norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis (481 +/- 75 and 96 +/- 16 pg/ml, respectively) than in those of the control group (307 +/- 33 and 42 +/- 10 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively). Plasma free dopamine levels were similar in both groups. Sulfoconjugated catecholamines were the predominant form in plasma from both cirrhotic patients and control subjects. The ratio of conjugated to total catecholamines was similar in the two groups. Therefore, it is unlikely that a defect in conjugation of catecholamines is contributing to the excessive plasma free norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations found in patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, in patients with cirrhosis, no significant relation was found between plasma conjugated catecholamines and the severity of liver disease. This study shows that cirrhosis does not induce alteration in conjugation of catecholamines and that hepatocellular function is not essential for conjugation of circulating catecholamines.\r"

  ".W": "Despite the importance of biliary calcium in the pathogenesis of gallstones, little is known about the sites or modes of entry of calcium into bile. We here examine the mechanisms of calcium entry into canine bile by comparing the entry of calcium, over a wide range of bile flows (2.4 to 38.0 microliters/kg per minute), with that of potassium, a small ion that is passively distributed throughout the biliary tract and that is also subject to alteration by Gibbs-Donnan forces. It is shown that (1) the concentrations of free ionized calcium, [Ca++], increases in an apparently linear fashion with increasing total bile salt concentration at low bile flow, whereas the rise in [Ca++] is strongly blunted at high rates of flow; (2) the entry of both calcium and potassium into bile is tightly linked to bile flow; and (3) calcium outputs are linearly related to potassium outputs with an intercept at the origin. These results indicate that the canaliculus is permeable to Ca++ ions, and that Ca++ enters bile primarily by passive convection and diffusion. Calcium entry is thus tightly linked to the water flux generated by bile salt secretion. Such passive entry and distribution indicate that calcium will always be present in bile and that possible therapeutic reduction of biliary [Ca++] for treatment, and possibly prevention of calcium-containing gallstones, will require sustained chelation of calcium within the lumen of the biliary tract.\r"

Because targeted lipid values were not reached on diet alone (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDLC] less than 120 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDLC] greater than 35 mg/dl or total cholesterol [TC]/HDLC less than 4.5), the patients received Lopid, 1.2 gm/day as their initial lipid-lowering drug. Because targeted lipid levels were not reached with Lopid treatment alone after 3 or more months, Mevacor was added, with 17 subjects receiving 20 mg/day, five receiving 40 mg, two receiving 60 mg, and one receiving 80 mg. Outpatient visits were repeated during combined therapy every 6 to 8 weeks, with an average of 6.4 visits per subject, 162 measurements of fasting lipids and liver function tests, and 127 measurements of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). By selection, all patients had normal liver function (gamma-glutamyltransferase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels) and normal CPK levels at baseline. No gamma-glutamyltransferase levels were high during combined therapy. Of the 162 liver function test measurements, five (3.1%) SGOT levels and three (1.9%) SGPT levels were high. Of 127 CPK measurements, three (2.4%) were high; one subject had a high CPK measurement, and one subject had two high measurements for CPK.

Images observed by light microscopy were transferred to the image analysis system and were processed to binary (black and white) images, and were then analyzed by area, perimeter, and shape. A circular shape factor (CSF = 4 pi X[area]/[perimeter]2) was found to be useful for elucidating the degree of deformation, but it could not differentiate elongated sickle cells from maple leaf-shaped cells. By combining an elliptical shape factor (ESF = [short axis]/[long axis]) with CSF we could separate deoxygenated homozygous sickle red cells (SS cells) into several morphologically distinct groups, including non-sickled cells, maple leaf-shaped cells, and elongated sickle cells. Using this automated image analysis system, we studied morphologic changes of SS cells exposed to deoxygenation-oxygenation (d-o) cycles between PO2 of 0 and 100 mm Hg (one cycle = 12 minutes) at pHs of 6.9 and 7.4. We found that at both pHs the morphology of sickled cells after the first deoxygenation was predominantly maple leaf-shaped. The number of elongated sickled cells increased as the number of d-o cycles increased, indicating that SS cells changed from maple leaf morphology to classic elongated sickle shape during d-o cycles. Desickling occurred less during the oxygenation phase at pH 6.9 than at pH 7.4 and as the number of d-o cycles increased. These results suggest that during d-o cycles deoxyhemoglobin S fibers may align to form large bundles that do not depolymerize completely even at the arterial oxygen pressure.\r"

The activated partial thromboplastin time was shorter than was that of human plasma, thus implying the presence of prothrombin in python plasma; however, this protein could be demonstrated only in trace amounts. Similarly, only small amounts of Hageman factor (factor XII) and antihemophilic factor (factor VIII) were detected, and none of plasma prekallikrein, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and Christmas factor (factor IX). The prothrombin time was slower than that of human plasma. Factor VII was not detected, but both proaccelerin (factor V) and Stuart factor (factor X) were present. Python plasma inhibited bovine thrombin and human plasmin, but it was deficient in fibrinolytic capacity.\r"

  ".W": "Titanium grommets have been promoted as having the advantage of a slower extrusion rate than other types of ventilation tube. A prospective trial was therefore designed to compare the function and extrusion rates of these grommets with those of the widely used Shepard design of Teflon grommet in a single group of patients. Thirty-one children had one type of grommet inserted in one ear and the other type in the opposite ear. After eight months there were significantly more Titanium grommets still functioning (p less than 0.05) but after 12 and after 16 months there was no significant difference in the extrusion rates of the two types of grommet. There was a higher incidence of infection with granulation tissue formation around the Titanium grommet. Accordingly it is concluded that the extra expense of the Titanium grommet is not justified, particularly as the long-term effects of these grommets on the tympanic membrane are not known.\r"

Most children will spontaneously regain normal air-filled middle ears, but a certain number will have persistent problems. In our department we will treat annually about 500 children on an outpatient basis, with the insertion of ventilating tubes in the eardrum. The reason for this study was to evaluate the effect of erythromycin, instead of inserting a ventilation tube, in children with bilateral OME of longer duration than three months (double blind/placebo). The study comprises 147 children, 1-15 years of age, 83 boys and 64 girls, all with OME for more than three months. All the patients were candidates for tube insertion. In the group treated with erythromycin, 12 patients out of 69 had bilaterally air-filled middle ears after one month, as compared to 19 out of 72 in the group treated with the placebo. No difference was noted due to sex or age. The results support our indication and timing for ventilation tube insertion.\r"

Seventeen of the patients suffered recurrence, but 11 of them after laryngectomy or radiotherapy are alive with no sign of the disease. Tracheostomy was not performed in the majority of our cases. The relationship between the site of recurrence and survival as well as the role of radiotherapy before and after cordectomy in some of our patients are discussed. We believe that despite the good results of radiotherapy in T1 carcinoma of the vocal cord and the introduction of other treatment modalities such as CO2 laser, cordectomy by laryngofissure is still of value with very good survival results and minimal discomfort for the patient.\r"

The prophylactic antibiotics used in all patients was parenteral cefotaxime 1G or cefuroxime 750 mg, given at eight hours pre-operatively, with the premedication and at eight, 16 and 24 hours post-operatively. Only two patients developed pharyngo-cutaneous fistulae, both after total laryngectomy (six per cent of total). Three patients developed skin cellulitis and five patients developed chest infection which required further treatment with antibiotics.\r"

The BMC was not significantly decreased at the initial examination. The longitudinal study revealed a small but statistically significant fall in BMC, mainly in trabecular bone. The narrow (95%) confidence interval of median end value (93.3-99.0% of initial BMC) indicates that the annual decrease in BMC in such patients is of the order of 0.5%, a reduction that is probably clinically insignificant.\r"

The oral plasma clearance of nifedipine was 1189 +/- 876 ml min-1, and the mean plasma half-life (t1/2) was 5.99 +/- 3.05 h. The pyridine metabolite was not retained. Plasma concentrations of nifedipine were found to be significantly correlated with the effects on blood pressure, forearm blood flow and peripheral resistance, and these effects did not vary with the degree of renal failure. Normotension was achieved in eight of the nine patients observed over a period of 4 months with doses in the range 20-40 mg, administered twice daily. The mean Cr-EDTA clearance remained unchanged during the study (initial value 31.4 +/- 12.3 ml min-1; final value 32.7 +/- 14.4 ml min-1), and in three patients it increased. Nifedipine induces a slight increase in metabolic rate in patients with renal failure, but it is not necessary to modify the dose. It is effective in lowering blood pressure, has mild side-effects and may improve renal function in some patients.\r"

  ".W": "Eskimos have a very low incidence of cardiovascular disease, at least in part due to a high intake of n-3 fatty acids. ESKIMO-3 is a new stabilized (insensitive to oxidation) fluid fish oil concentrate, 30 ml of which contains an amount of eicosapentaenoic acid and total n-3 fatty acids equivalent to the daily intake among Eskimos. Thirty-three volunteers, healthy or with coronary artery disease, were given ESKIMO-3, at a dose of 15 or 30 ml d-1, corresponding to 2.7 or 5.4 g of eicosapentaenoic acid d-1, or placebo oil, for a period of up to 6 months. ESKIMO-3 had a pronounced dose-dependent effect on several risk factors for coronary artery disease. Intake of one tablespoon (15 ml) daily for 6 months significantly reduced levels of triglycerides (-64%), total cholesterol (-8%), plasma fibrinogen (-23%) and diastolic blood pressure (-9%). Bleeding time was unchanged. Intake of two tablespoons daily for 4 weeks increased plasma eicosapentaenoic acid levels by 490%, and decreased arachidonic acid by 20%. The HDL concentration increased by 21%. No change in the above mentioned variables was observed after intake of placebo oil.\r"

We present here the case of a patient with carbamazepine-induced generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, abnormal differential leucocyte count, and hypergammaglobulinaemia. There was evidence of severe immune dysregulation. All abnormalities subsided spontaneously after withdrawal of carbamazepine and the patient remained in good health afterwards.\r"

  ".U": "90257543\r", 
  ".W": "Fifty consecutive patients with confirmed PCP received a high dose of cotrimoxazole for 14 d, or until development of intolerance, directly followed by reduced dose maintenance therapy. Seven individuals died during the high dose course. Twenty (47%) of the 43 survivors showed toxicity reactions that necessitated dose reduction to maintenance level on average after 9.6 d. Thirteen of these 20 individuals tolerated the reduced dose, and seven did not. No further cases of toxicity were observed. In 43 survivors only one early relapse (day 17) was observed in a patient who had received full dose treatment for 14 d. We conclude (1) that extending high dose cotrimoxazole therapy beyond 2 weeks is usually unnecessary, provided that reduced dose maintenance therapy is given directly, and (2) that dose reduction on appearance of toxicity signs during the second week of treatment is safe and allows two-thirds of patients to be maintained on cotrimoxazole with satisfactory results.\r"

Unlike previous studies, we examined whether the severity of specific features of depression (mood, self reproach, vegetative, and somatic symptoms) differ with respect to the progression of PD. Results indicated that symptoms related to both mood and self-reproach were present in the early stages of PD but did not increase in severity with advancing disease. Somatic features of depression were evident early and increased with disease progression, and vegetative symptoms were seen only in the later stages of PD. The different patterns of these depressive features with progression of PD may account in part for the variations seen in previous studies.\r"

On half the movements, subjects were pre-cued on the direction and amplitude of an impending movement. On the remaining movements, only the direction was pre-specified, and the amplitude was determined only when the cue to move was presented. Reaction time performance of patients was evaluated at three infusion levels of levodopa so that the patients were optimally, moderately, or minimally medicated. Parkinsonian patients were always slower to react and move than normal subjects. Clinical state correlated with movement time, but not with reaction time. These results contrast with those in which reaction time was related to plasma levodopa levels when movement direction and initiation were processed concomitantly, but the movement amplitude was pre-cued. It is possible that specification of the amount of muscle activity is partially independent of dopaminergic transmission.\r"

In the population of patients who showed the previously reported abnormalities of remembered saccades, antisaccades were indistinguishable from those of controls in latency, gain and peak velocity. This finding implies that antisaccades are mediated through pathways which are unaffected by Parkinson's disease, and which are therefore presumably distinct from pathways mediating other voluntary saccades.\r"

Three patients (3.45%) and 34 control subjects (6.12%), having an MR greater than 12.6, were classified as poor metabolisers (PM) of DBQ (ns). The distribution of MR values in the 84 Parkinsonian patients classified as extensive metabolisers (EM) showed a less efficient oxidative rate when compared with controls of the same phenotype (p less than 0.001). This difference may be due to enzymatic inhibition caused by drug treatment in 40 of these patients. As in patients not taking any drug known to inhibit the oxidation of DBQ, distribution of MR values was not different from that in controls. A negative correlation (r = -0.36, p less than 0.02) was found between MR of DBQ and age at onset of disease in patients free of drugs known to interact with DBQ metabolism. A higher rate of DBQ oxidation could be a genetic factor that delays the clinical onset of Parkinson's disease in predisposed people.\r"

Nevertheless, a subgroup of patients experience continuing post-concussive difficulties and neuropsychological deficits. This study examined 53 symptomatic minor head injury patients referred for neuropsychological evaluation between one and 22 months after injury. These individuals performed significantly poorer than uninjured controls on four of eight neuropsychological tests. Patients who lost consciousness during injury obtained test scores similar to persons who experienced disorientation or confusion but no loss of consciousness. The results indicate that minor head injury patients who report post-concussive symptoms possess measurable neuropsychological deficits and the severity of these deficits is independent of neurological status immediately following injury.\r"

In addition, the clinical records of all patients were analysed retrospectively. On the basis of their clinical presentation they were subdivided into patients with a pure cerebellar syndrome (n = 9) and patients with a cerebellar syndrome and additional non-cerebellar symptoms (n = 13). No attempts were made to classify patients with a disease duration of less than four years (n = 6) because the retrospective analysis showed that the disease started almost invariably with a pure cerebellar syndrome and additional symptoms came later. Patients with a lasting pure cerebellar syndrome had a significantly better prognosis than patients with additional non-cerebellar involvement (annual progression rate rate: 0.40 versus 0.80). Calculated median lifetime from onset of symptoms was 20.7 years in patients with a pure cerebellar syndrome and 7.7 years in patients with additional non-cerebellar symptoms. Among the latter, disease progression was faster the earlier non-cerebellar symptoms occurred. All of them presented with Parkinsonian symptoms, whereas bulbar symptoms, vertical gaze paresis, pyramidal deficits, dementia and urinary incontinence were encountered less frequently. MRI or CT showed cerebellar atrophy without apparent involvement of brainstem structures in all patients with a pure cerebellar syndrome suggesting the diagnosis of cerebellar cortical atrophy (CA). The majority of the patients with additional non-cerebellar symptoms had evidence of an atrophy of the cerebellum and the brainstem suggesting the presence of olivo-ponto-cerebellar atrophy (OPCA). In two of them, however, MRI morphology was not compatible with the diagnosis of OPCA.\r"

  ".U": "90257617\r", 
  ".W": "The temporal structure of arm movements was studied in nine cerebellar patients with mild impairment of the upper limbs and in six age-matched control subjects. The experimental paradigm consisted of visually guided, step tracking movements about the elbow. Movements ranged from 10 degrees to 70 degrees in amplitude and were made under different instructions (fast, fast/accurate, accurate). As in normal subjects, cerebellar patients were able to scale peak velocity with movement amplitude. This relationship was highly linear under all instruction conditions. Similar relationships existed between movement duration and amplitude. In contrast to normal subjects who produced movements with nearly symmetric velocity profiles, movements made by cerebellar patients were characterised by short acceleration and long deceleration durations. The degree of asymmetry was directly related to movement duration but was unaffected by movement peak velocity. Acceleration durations did not increase beyond 300 ms even in movements lasting up to 1s. These findings demonstrate that, despite little or no obvious impairment of the limb during routine examination, the temporal structure of voluntary movements in cerebellar patients is clearly disturbed. This supports the view that the production of an optimal movement trajectory is under cerebellar influence.\r"
