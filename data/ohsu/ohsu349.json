Two white blood cell cytograms are produced based on peroxidase activity and nuclear characteristics of the cells. Ninety cases of leukemia were studied. The 25 cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) could be distinguished from the 39 cases of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia as the lymphocyte percentage was greater than 50% in the ALL cases and the mean peroxidase index value was 0 in 80% of the cases. The ALL cases and the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases also had different cytogram patterns. Subtypes of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia could not be absolutely distinguished, although promyelocytic leukemias (M3) had characteristic cytograms and a monocyte percentage above 15% suggested a monocytic component (M4 or M5). Chronic myelogenous leukemia likewise seemed to have a recognizable pattern. Since a sample takes only 60 s to process, information is readily available. The unique data available from this instrument should provide a significant advancement in the automated hematology field.\r"

In addition, each displays novel and instructive features. We argue that the surface and globin phenotype of all erythroleukemia lines is nonrandom and that it may be of physiologic relevance; it could represent the most prevalent phenotype of cells transformed by leukemia in vivo, and it raises the possibility that cells with similar potentials exist transiently during normal hematopoietic differentiation before their irreversible commitment to a single lineage. As such, these cells demonstrate a greater phenotypic adaptability in vitro than do their single lineage-committed counterparts since they can differentiate toward more than one lineage.\r"

To determine what roles degradation and decreasing of synthesis played in the disappearance of M2-PK during erythroid maturation, M2-PK and R-PK synthesis and degradation were studied in erythroblasts from fetal liver and blood BFU-E-derived erythroblasts from healthy subjects, an erythroleukemic patient, and a patient with an erythrocyte PK hyperactivity associated with M2-PK persistence in mature erythrocytes. In normal erythroblasts, R-PK synthesis was constant throughout erythroid maturation, whereas M2-PK synthesis decreased to the point of becoming undetectable. R-PK degradation was very low, while M2-PK degradation was more pronounced and steady during erythroid maturation. In leukemic erythroblasts, total protein turnover was higher than in normal cells, but the M2-PK degradation rate was lower. In erythroblasts from the patient with M2-PK persistence in mature erythrocytes, M2-PK synthesis did not decline with cell maturation. In conclusion, our results emphasize the importance of the decrease of M2-PK synthesis in the disappearance of M2-PK during erythroid maturation. Further studies of patients with pathologic persistence of M2-PK synthesis will help in the understanding of this event involved in erythroid maturation.\r"

The blast cell populations studied were characterized by morphologic, cytochemical, immunochemical, and molecular criteria. With all the methods used the populations were found to be highly homogeneous and showed a typical lymphoid phenotype. In particular, the Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangement was largely prevalent, and the germ line configuration was almost absent. However, in three of eight cases, high levels of MPO mRNA were detected. The remarkable homogeneity of the cell populations examined suggests that the MPO mRNA observed was present in cellular elements certainly identified as lymphoid. The absence of contamination by myeloid cells was confirmed by the results of Western blot analysis of the proteins of the cell population studied: no MPO protein was detectable. The levels of mRNA observed were high enough to be comparable to those observed in a promyelocytic cell population.\r"

R binders were absent from gastric juices as well as from serum, saliva, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The patient's father exhibited absence of R binder in his serum with a low serum vitamin B12 level and was asymptomatic.

Three pathologic stages were used: Stage I; carcinoma invading not further than the muscle coat of the gallbladder, with or without extension along Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses in the subserosa (11 cases); Stage II, carcinoma extending to the subserosal fibroadipose tissue of the gallbladder (73 cases); and Stage III: carcinoma invading the adjacent organs such as the duodenum, liver, and colon (19 cases). In the 11 patients with Stage I carcinoma, there was no apparent lymph node metastasis and all remained well for 3 months to 14 years after the initial operation. The cumulative 3-year survival rate of Stage I (100%) was significantly higher than of Stage II (40%) and Stage III (10%) (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.001). The Stage I tumors, therefore, can be defined as early carcinoma of the gallbladder. Dysplastic epithelium was seen in the mucosa adjacent to the malignant lesion in 57% of those with gallbladder carcinoma: 73% in Stage I, 59% in Stage II, and 42% in Stage III. Nine gallbladders had multiple foci of adenocarcinoma in a background of a diffuse dysplasia. Immunohistochemical study for carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 resulted in positive staining of the dysplastic epithelial element adjacent to the invasive carcinoma and, in a similar fashion, in the carcinoma itself, thereby indicating a close relation between the epithelial dysplasia and adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder.\r"

  ".W": "Scatchard analyses of the binding of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) to membranes from rat ventral prostate revealed the presence of high affinity (Kd = 140 pM) saturable binding sites for [125I]TGF beta. The binding of [125I]TGF beta to prostatic membranes, while displaced in the presence of excess unlabeled TGF beta, is unaffected by epidermal growth factor, nerve growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, or insulin, indicating the specificity of binding. Affinity labeling of these membrane receptors by covalent attachment to [125I]TGF beta with bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate and subsequent electrophoretic analysis of the labeled complexes revealed the specific binding of [125I]TGF beta to a macromolecule that predominantly migrates as a 260,000 mol wt band in 7.5% acrylamide gels. Castration-induced androgen deprivation produced a significant increase in [125I]TGF beta binding to prostatic membranes with no apparent change in the affinity of membrane receptors for TGF beta. TGF beta receptor levels per total gland increased approximately 2-fold by 3 days after castration, reached a peak value by day 4, and then declined during the subsequent 10 days. Androgen administration to 4-day castrated animals decreased the number of TGF beta receptors to a value similar to that in the intact controls. These results demonstrate the presence of specific binding sites for TGF beta in the rat ventral prostate. Furthermore, the TGF beta receptor levels seem to be under negative androgenic regulation, indicating a potential role for this growth factor in the mechanism of activation of castration-induced death of androgen-dependent epithelial cells in the ventral prostate.\r"

The same synthetic peptides (alpha 26-46 and alpha 31-45) significantly (P less than 0.05) inhibited the adenylate cyclase-stimulating activity of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) from 10 patients with hyperthyroid Graves' disease. Peptide alpha 26-46 was the most potent, resulting in 79.1 +/- 8.8% (+/- SE) inhibition at 133 micrograms/mL, while peptide alpha 31-45 inhibited TSI activity by 36.3 +/- 5.2%. Peptides alpha 61-75 and alpha 81-92, that had only minimal ability to inhibit TSH-mediated cAMP generation, did not significantly inhibit TSI activity. The inhibitory action of alpha 26-46 was dose dependent, and a significant negative correlation was found between the maximum TSI activity of the serum sample and the inhibition achieved by the synthetic peptide, suggesting that differences in TSI affinity and/or titer may account for the variable inhibitory activity of the peptides. These results suggest that TSI interact with the TSH receptor at the site that recognizes the portion of the TSH alpha-subunit represented by the synthetic peptide alpha 26-46 and, thus, support the concept that the TSH-binding site of the TSH receptor is the site of antigen binding between TSI and the thyroid cell.\r"

Mesangial cells preferentially took up 195Au particles covered with BSA-anti-BSA-IgG over those covered with BSA or the F(ab')2 fragment. This uptake was a time-dependent and saturable process inhibitable by sodium azide or cytochalasin B. Using phase-contrast microscopy in the light reflectance mode, it was established that essentially all mesangial cells took up IgG-coated gold particles. By electron microscopy the process was shown to consist of vesicular uptake with delivery to endosomes. Mesangial binding-uptake of the IgG-covered particles was associated with stimulation of PGE2 synthesis and production of platelet-activating factor, a lipid mediator of inflammation. To characterize the potential Fc receptor for IgG we used the rosetting technique with sheep red blood cells coated with IgG subclass-specific mouse monoclonal antibodies. 50% of mesangial cells exhibited rosetting with red cells coated with mouse IgG2a, whereas negligible rosetting was observed with IgG2b or IgG1. Competition experiments confirmed the specificity of IgG2a binding. We conclude that cultured rat mesangial cells exhibit specific receptors for IgG and that occupancy of Fc receptors results in endocytosis and is associated with generation of PGE2 and platelet-activating factor. These observations may be of significance for immune-mediated glomerular diseases.\r"

The decrease in the West is attributed to increased use of fluorides, but the increase in developing countries has been explained by an increase in the consumption of sugar. As this information continues to propel researchers to find sucrose substitutes, xylitol has been singled out as a proposed sucrose replacement. The question tackled by this study was: Can the daily use of chewing gum containing xylitol increase the efficacy of the existing caries-preventive measures now regularly used for 11- to 15-year-old children in most industrialized western countries?\r"

  ".U": "88332388\r", 
  ".W": "Adult chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), as defined by the French-American-British (FAB) group, is associated with a variable survival, ranging from a few weeks to several years. From 1971 to 1986, we made the diagnosis of CMML in 107 cases, according to FAB criteria (except for patients with 20% to 30% bone marrow [BM] blasts who were also included). Median survival was 30 months (range 1 to 81 months) and life expectancy did not seem to be influenced by treatment modalities other than supportive care. Eighteen patients (17%) progressed to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). In a Cox regression model, main factors associated with short survival were: an excess of marrow blasts (P = 10(-6], anemia (P = .17 x 10(-5], high peripheral blood (PB) monocytosis (P = .26 x 10(-5], presence of PB blasts (P = .49 x 10(-4], and to a lesser extent hyperleukocytosis (P = .001), presence of PB immature granulocytes, thrombopenia, and splenomegaly. Survival (less than 1 year v greater than 1 year) could be predicted at diagnosis in a multivariate stepwise discriminant analysis using two parameters only (percentage of BM blasts and hemoglobin level), with 82% accuracy. Among patients surviving greater than 1 year, initial PB leukocyte count was higher in patients with intermediate survival (12 to 42 months) than in long survivors (greater than 42 months) and was the only discriminating factor between these two subgroups in multivariate analysis. Abnormal cytogenetic findings and increased lysozymuria were also poor prognostic factors, but could not be analyzed in the multivariate models, as they were determined in a minority of patients. Parameters associated with subsequent progression to ANLL included younger age at diagnosis, thrombopenia, increased BM blasts, and splenomegaly. Our study allows for the identification of subgroups with different prognoses in CMML, on the basis of a small number of hematologic parameters, particularly initial percentage of BM blasts, hemoglobin level, and leukocytosis. These subgroups probably require different therapeutic approaches.\r"

  ".W": "Data were collected from 124 patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and WBC greater than 200,000/microL seen at institutions affiliated with the Children's Cancer Study Group (CCSG) from April 1981 to May 1983. The presenting characteristics, initial management, early complications, and outcome were reviewed. All the children received vigorous intravenous (IV) hydration, alkalinization of the urine, and allopurinol. Thirty-two patients were started on full therapy with no additional measure. One or more special measures believed to reduce the complications of leukostasis and blast cell lysis were administered to 92 patients as follows: small initial doses of prednisone, 63; emergency cranial irradiation, 26; exchange transfusion, 21; and leukopheresis, 19. The incidence of CNS hemorrhage was only 3% (4/124). Seven patients expired during induction and four failed to achieve a remission by day 28. Nineteen patients (15%) had documented bacterial or fungal sepsis. Mild to moderate electrolyte abnormalities occurred in 29 patients: three patients required renal dialysis. Pretreatment with small doses of prednisone did not decrease the incidence of electrolyte abnormalities in those patients when compared with patients who received full chemotherapy. The event-free survival (EFS) for the 106 patients treated on one of the three intensive pilot studies is 55% at 36 months. On multivariate analysis the two significant adverse prognostic factors were massive splenomegaly (P = .02) and WBC count greater than 600,000/microL (P = .05). In conclusion, in patients with hyperleukocytosis the complications of blast cell lysis and leukostasis were manageable with acceptable morbidity and minimal mortality in a group of patients treated with vigorous hydration, allopurinol, and alkalinization of the urine before beginning chemotherapy. Selected patients with severe hyperuricemia and renal dysfunction may benefit from leukopheresis. No beneficial role was demonstrated for the use of small initial doses of prednisone or emergency cranial irradiation.\r"

  ".W": "Administration of ethanol (5 g/kg p.o.) to female Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in conversion of a portion of hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase 12 hr after treatment. Conversion was partly reversed in vitro by treatment of hepatic 100,000 X g supernatant with dithiothreitol, whereas pretreatment of rats with pyrazole (100 mg/kg i.p.) prevented conversion 18 hr after ethanol administration. Incubation of acetaldehyde with rat liver supernatant at 37 degrees C converted xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase in a dose-dependent manner, whereas incubation of ethanol with rat liver supernatant did not lead to conversion. Acetaldehyde-induced conversion in vitro was reversed by treatment with dithiothreitol, and was partially blocked by addition of equimolar concentrations of reduced glutathione. These data suggest that biotransformation of ethanol is required for conversion of hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase. Because xanthine oxidase utilizes molecular oxygen to produce superoxide radical, ethanol-induced conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase could contribute to the enhanced lipid peroxidation reported previously after administration of a single dose of ethanol.\r"

Surprisingly, both erythroleukemias exhibited the del(3)(p14p23) predominantly found in SCLC. In four other patients who had secondary erythroleukemias associated with other cancers, no deletions of 3p were found. These findings could be accounted for by one of three possible mechanisms: (a) an inherited recessive gene (anti-oncogene or tumor suppressor gene) in this region of 3p was uncovered by the combined modality therapy, (b) an inherited predisposition to damage of both chromosomes at 3p14 leads to SCLC and erythroleukemia after exposure to carcinogens and/or chemotherapy-radiotherapy, or (c) the finding of lineage specificity for the 3p deletion with the presence of the 3p deletion in SCLC and erythroleukemia suggests a common bone marrow precursor.\r"

  ".U": "88334625\r", 
  ".W": "To produce concentrations of zidovudine (AZT) in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid that would provide constant inhibition of the replication of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), we gave AZT by continuous intravenous infusion to 21 children ranging in age from 14 months to 12 years who had acquired HIV infection through transfusions or perinatally. All patients were symptomatic before AZT treatment (Class P2 of the Centers for Disease Control); 13 (62 percent) had evidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities. The mean CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.18; 11 patients had CD4 counts below 0.2 x 10(9) per liter. We administered AZT at four dose levels: 0.5, 0.9, 1.4, and 1.8 mg per kilogram of body weight per hour. The plasma drug concentrations achieved at the respective dose levels were 1.9 +/- 0.3, 2.8 +/- 1.4, 3.1 +/- 1.1, and 4.5 +/- 1.0 microM. The steady-state cerebrospinal fluid:plasma ratio was 0.24 +/- 0.07. The only evidence of toxicity was bone marrow suppression. Transfusion was required in 14 patients because of low levels of hemoglobin (5 mmol per liter [less than 8 g per deciliter]). Dose-limiting neutropenia (less than 0.5 x 10(9) polymorphonuclear leukocytes per cubic millimeter) occurred in most patients who received doses of 1.4 mg per kilogram per hour or more. Improvement in neurodevelopmental abnormalities occurred in all 13 children who had presented with encephalopathy before treatment. Serial measurements of IQ before therapy and after three and six months of continuous therapy with AZT showed that IQ scores, including those for verbal and performance IQ, rose in these 13 patients and in 5 other children who had no detectable evidence of encephalopathy before treatment. Most patients also had increased appetite and weight, decreased lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly, decreased immunoglobulin levels, and increased numbers of CD4 cells. In some patients the improvement in the features of encephalopathy occurred despite the absence of immunologic improvement. We conclude that AZT is beneficial in children with symptomatic HIV infection, especially those with encephalopathy (which may be subclinical), and that the optimal continuous intravenous dose of AZT in children is between 0.9 and 1.4 mg per kilogram per hour.\r"

  ".W": "We examined the immunosuppressor role of the first-trimester human placental macrophages on maternal lymphocyte alloreactivity in vitro to determine whether these macrophages and their secreted mediator(s) participate in the local immunoregulation at the fetomaternal interface. These cells were tested for their effects on maternal lymphocyte proliferation when added alone (as stimulator cells) or as regulator cells in 1) a one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction for six days and 2) lymphocyte cultures in the presence of phytohemagglutinin for three days. We detected a dose-dependent inhibition of phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation with 48-hour macrophage culture supernatants. Placental macrophages, when used alone as stimulator cells in the mixed lymphocyte reaction, were stimulatory only at a concentration of 1-2%; the stimulation was abolished at a concentration of 10%. When used as regulator cells, they showed a strong inhibition of mixed lymphocyte reaction and phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation at a concentration of 10%; no effect was observed at a concentration of 1-2%. The major class of the molecules mediating the suppression was identified as prostaglandins, primarily prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), based on the findings that the presence of indomethacin (10(-5) M) or various dilutions of an anti-PGE2 antibody abrogated suppression substantially or completely. Prostaglandin E2 levels measured in the mixed leukocyte culture wells containing placental macrophages as regulator cells correlated positively with the macrophage dose and its suppressive effect.\r"

Patients with nephrotoxicity tended to be older than patients without nephrotoxicity; gender and total amphotericin B dose were not related to nephrotoxicity. Sodium administration has previously been shown to reverse amphotericin B nephrotoxicity. In this series, among patients receiving ticarcillin at greater than or equal to 18 gm/day (93.6 mEq of sodium per day) the incidence of nephrotoxicity was significantly decreased (1/30, or 3.3%). A multivariate analysis showed that this protective effect of ticarcillin was not dependent on the fact that patients receiving ticarcillin were less likely to receive vancomycin. There were insufficient patients receiving sodium in the absence of ticarcillin to study the effect of sodium alone. However, our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that sodium can prevent renal dysfunction in this clinical situation.\r"

Twelve out of 103 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) developed CNS leukemia in spite of prophylaxis consisting of intrathecal methotrexate. Ten out of 217 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) developed CNS leukemia. None had been given preventive treatment. Leukemic blasts with either M4 or M5 morphology appeared to increase the risk of CNS relapse. Treatment was adjusted to the clinical problem of each patient, but always included intrathecal methotrexate. Median survival after a diagnosis of CNS leukemia was 8 and 6 months in ALL and AML respectively, with bone marrow failure due to hematologic relapse as the leading cause of death. CNS leukemia, if properly treated, does probably not shorten survival. An active approach to diagnosis and treatment is therefore mandatory.\r"

Patients achieving steady-state pharmacodynamics (more than three doses of the drug) were considered eligible for study. Ceftizoxime levels were determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. All levels measured after the first hour of treatment were indicative of the relative concentration of ceftizoxime in the fetal and amniotic fluid compartments when compared with the maternal compartment. Mean (+/- SEM) ceftizoxime levels were 11.96 + 2.35 micrograms/ml in maternal serum, 24.54 +/- 4.78 micrograms/ml in cord serum, and 43.45 +/- 4.97 micrograms/ml in amniotic fluid. Based on its broad antibacterial activity and its high concentration in fetal blood and amniotic fluid, ceftizoxime appears to be an ideal agent for treatment of the intrauterine environment.\r"

The incidence of dreaming in the 72 patients who were not pretreated was 16.7% compared with 2.8% in the patients pretreated with tubocurarine. This difference is statistically significant. The use of an intermittent suxamethonium technique gives a high incidence of dreaming which may be caused by muscle spindle discharge that produces cerebral arousal.

Changes in fatty acyl composition of both plasma and erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine were noted. The composition of the fatty acids in phosphatidylcholine in the outer leaflet of the bilayer was determined after hydrolysis of outer leaflet phospholipids, first with phospholipase A2 and subsequently with sphingomyelinase. The distributions of acyl constituents of phosphatidylcholine in the inner and the outer monolayers of the membrane were found to be distinctively different, regardless of the dietary fat intake. For example, palmitic acid and oleic acid were predominantly present in the phosphatidylcholine of the inner monolayer, and arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were present in that of the outer monolayer. Despite such diet-induced changes in phosphatidylcholine fatty acid composition, no alteration in erythrocyte integrity was observed when monitored by either morphology or ektacytometry.\r"

  ".W": "This study examined resting metabolic rate in adolescent wrestlers to test the hypothesis that repeated cycles of weight loss and regain would be associated with reduced energy requirements. Energy restriction lowers resting metabolic rate in normal-weight and obese persons. Repeated cycles of weight loss and regain can increase food efficiency, defined as the degree of weight change per unit of food intake, in animals. Many wrestlers lose weight repeatedly as they \"cut weight\" for matches. This cycle of weight loss and regain may affect their resting metabolism. Twenty-seven wrestlers were classified as cyclers or non-cyclers based on their weight loss history. Resting metabolic rate was measured using indirect calorimetry and body composition was evaluated using six skinfolds. Cyclers and noncyclers did not differ in age, weight, height, surface area, lean body mass, or percent body fat. Cyclers had a significantly lower mean resting metabolic rate than noncyclers (154.6 vs 177.2 kJ/m2/h) (4.6 vs 5.5 kJ per kilogram of lean body mass per hour). There was a 14% difference between the cyclers and the noncyclers in resting energy expenditure (6631.8 vs 7702.8 kJ/d). Weight cycling in wrestlers appears to be associated with a lowered resting metabolic rate.\r"

The women were matched on the basis of date of delivery, age, parity, number of previous miscarriages, gravidity, socioeconomic status and delivery after 32 weeks' gestation. The Burlington Randomized Controlled Trial criteria, which reflect community standards of care, were updated and used to assess the information, which was provided on standard provincial prenatal care forms. Scoring was carried out blindly, and interrater reliability was high. A highly significant difference was found in the proportions of NM and FP charts that were rated adequate, superior or inadequate: 77% v. 24%, 7% v. 16% and 16% v. 60% respectively. The rate at which procedures were omitted (leading to an inadequate score) in the categories of initial assessment, monitoring and management also varied between the two patient groups. These findings, even when considered in terms of several biases that may have resulted in the high proportion of NM charts rated at least adequate, suggest that NMs provide prenatal care to low-risk women that is comparable, if not superior, to the care provided by FPs.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary function studies were performed before and after one-time administration of an inhaled bronchodilator to ascertain the relative diagnostic value of using FVC, FEF25-75%, static lung volumes, Raw, and/or sGaw measurements, in addition to the FEV1, to assess the reversibility of chronic airways obstruction in nonasthmatic patients. A total of 517 patients underwent 686 spirometric tests, 264 (38 percent) of which disclosed a significant response to bronchodilators. In 247 (93 percent) studies, this response included a significant change in FEV1 and/or FEF25-75%, while in 17 studies (7 percent), the postbronchodilator improvement was seen exclusively in the FVC measurement. It is concluded that, in the clinical setting, analyzing static lung volumes, Raw, sGaw, and spirometric parameters other than the FEV1, seldom yields meaningful additional information regarding the reversibility of chronic airways obstruction in nonasthmatic patients. Finally, potentially misleading results can be seen in a relatively small proportion of studies due to errors in the FVC and/or FEF25-75% measurements.\r"

At 1 and 8 weeks postinjection the rabbits were either sacrificed or treated by cerebrospinal fluid shunting for 1 week. Blood vessel profiles in the periventricular neuropil were examined by light microscopy. In the caudate nucleus, septal area, and corpus callosum, hydrocephalus caused a reduction in the number of capillaries but no changes were observed in the number of larger blood vessels. Shunting reduced the size of the ventricles to normal and the number of capillaries increased if hydrocephalus was present for 1 week prior to shunting. If hydrocephalus was present for 8 weeks prior to shunting, the number of capillaries did not increase. These observations support the concept that collapse of capillaries may account for the decreased cerebral blood flow that has been measured in hydrocephalic brains.\r"

In vitro, this drug interacts with double-helical DNA in the minor groove and causes site-specific double-stranded cleavage. It is proposed that the observed cleavage specificity is a result of a unique fit of the drug and DNA followed by the generation of a nondiffusible 1,4-dehydrobenzene--diradical species that initiates oxidative strand scission by hydrogen abstraction on the deoxyribose ring. The ability of calicheamicin gamma 1I to cause double-strand cuts at very low concentrations may account for its potent antitumor activity.\r"

  ".W": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of variations in blood ionized calcium (Ca2+) on myocardial contractility independent of changes in loading conditions and other biochemical variables. DESIGN: Hemodialysis done in a randomized, double-blind manner with dialysates differing in calcium concentration only. Left ventricular contractility was assessed using the load- and heart rate-independent relationship between end-systolic wall stress (sigma es) and rate-corrected velocity of fiber shortening (Vcfc). SETTING: In-hospital dialysis unit and echocardiography laboratory of a university medical center. PATIENTS: Seven patients with stable, chronic renal failure maintained on regular hemodialysis. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient was hemodialyzed three times within 1 week with dialysates differing in calcium concentration only. Ultrafiltration was adjusted to achieve the same postdialysis weight. Immediately after dialysis, two-dimensionally targeted M-mode echocardiographic and calibrated carotid pulse tracings were recorded over a wide range of left ventricular end-systolic wall stress values (a measure of left ventricular afterload) generated by either methoxamine or nitroprusside. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: After dialysis, three statistically distinct levels of Ca2+ were achieved. When Ca2+ was 1.34 +/- 0.03 mmol/L, Vcfc, calculated at a common level of afterload (sigma es = 50 g/cm2), was 1.01 +/- 0.05 cir/sec; at low Ca2+ (1.02 +/- 0.02 mmol/L), Vcfc fell to 0.89 +/- 0.04 cir/sec (P less than 0.001 compared with medium); at high Ca2+ (1.68 +/- 0.07 mmol/L) Vcfc rose to 1.10 +/- 0.03 circ/sec (P less than 0.001 compared with medium and low). CONCLUSION: Variations in Ca2+ are directly correlated with clinically significant changes in myocardial contractility.\r"

Mean arterial blood pressure fell at a mean rate of 3.9 mm Hg/hour during dialysis with acetate fluid and 1.4 mm Hg/hour during dialysis with bicarbonate fluid. The rate of fall was significantly greater during dialysis with acetate fluid compared with bicarbonate fluid. Heart rate increased by a mean rate of 2.6 beats/min/hour during dialysis with both acetate and bicarbonate fluid. Vascular resistance in the forearm increased at a rate of 3.6 units/hour during dialysis with acetate fluid and 4.5 units/hour during dialysis with bicarbonate fluid, but the venous bed of the forearm dilated. The index of venous tone rose at a mean rate of 0.23 ml/dl [corrected] over 40 mm Hg/hour during dialysis with acetate fluid and 0.20 ml/dl over 40 mm Hg/hour during dialysis with bicarbonate fluid.

Of the service factors, high proportions of elderly and singlehanded general practitioners and high average list sizes were also associated with a low uptake of immunisation in some of the analyses. The results suggest that the measures outlined in the government's white paper on improving primary health care services are likely to lead to improved uptakes of immunisation. If, however, the uptakes of immunisation are used as a measure of standards of the services provided they should first be adjusted to control for variations in social conditions, and the quality of vaccination data would have to be improved.\r"

As of January 1, 1987, 1019 deaths had occurred among these women, who had contributed 40,919 years of follow-up. Women who had used estrogen replacement therapy had a relative risk of death due to all causes of 0.80 compared with women who had never used estrogens (p = 0.0005). Much of this reduced mortality rate was due to a marked reduction in the death rate of acute myocardial infarction among users of estrogen (55 deaths) compared with nonusers (94 deaths; relative risk = 0.59, p = 0.002). This lower acute myocardial infarction death rate was maintained even in the presence of other known risk factors for coronary artery disease. There was no substantial effect of dose or duration of estrogen use on risk, but the relatively small number of deaths limited our ability to estimate these effects accurately. Current users (those who were using estrogen at the time of the initial questionnaire) had a relative risk of 0.47 and past users had a risk of 0.62 compared with women who had never used estrogen (p = 0.003 for trend). A reduced hospitalization rate for acute myocardial infarction was similarly observed for estrogen users compared with nonusers (relative risk = 0.72, p = 0.03).\r"

This paper deals with 35 patients with full-thickness defects following burns in whom deepithelialized turnover dermis flaps and deepithelialized turnover flaps with deep fascia have been used. This flap is an extension of Hynes's reversed dermis graft and Smahel's deepithelialized turnover flap where there is a larger area of blood supply on the deeper aspect of the dermis. If a good hinge is provided for safe blood supply, such a flap settles well in the defect, and cumbersome multistaged procedures can be avoided. If there is less fatty tissue in the area of flap used, then reversed dermis flaps are ideal because split-skin graft take is good. When there is a lot of fatty tissue on the undersurface of dermis, the fascia is also included to make it a reversed fasciocutaneous flap to augment the blood supply and for better split-skin graft survival. Advantages of the procedure and complications are elaborated.\r"

  ".W": "In mammals, X-chromosome dosage compensation is achieved by inactivating one X chromosome in female cells. To test the hypothesis that genes on the silent X chromosome reactivate as a consequence of ageing, we examined the X-linked hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus in 41 women who are heterozygous for mutations at this locus, leading to severe deficiency of the enzyme (Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). We find that heterozygotes who are more than 10 yr old have an excess of HPRT+ skin fibroblast clones (59% rather than the 50% expected as a consequence of random X inactivation) but this excess does not increase with age. Further studies of eight of these heterozygotes show that the silent locus does not detectably reactivate spontaneously in culture, but only in response to treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine, a potent inhibitor of methylation. There is no age difference in the frequency of this reactivation as assayed by HATr clones, and a more sensitive autoradiographic assay shows only a twofold difference between young and old heterozygotes. Thus, age-related reactivation is not a feature of all X-linked loci, and may have species, tissue and locus-specific determinants.\r"

In 12 (54%) of 22 institutions, only contrast-enhanced scans were performed. The preferred dose for enhancement was 150 ml of 60% contrast material. Eight (36%) of the 22 respondents obtained images during the administration of a bolus of contrast material, whereas nine (41%) obtained images during the administration of a sustained drip infusion given after a loading bolus. Follow-up in 1987 revealed that two departments had switched to obtaining images during the administration of a bolus. The availability of CT power injectors and refinements in the rapid-scanning capabilities of CT scanners have increased the popularity of obtaining images of the liver during the administration of a bolus of contrast material. Despite this, in many departments, contrast material is still administered via drip infusion in CT studies of the liver.\r"

Review of these patients' records showed that 18 (90%) of 20 had underlying disease processes that could have caused dilated lymphatics as a result of either increased lymph flow or lymphatic obstruction. We have grouped these processes into three etiologic categories: (1) posttraumatic hepatic lymphatic obstruction, (2) obstruction caused by malignant lymphadenopathy, and (3) congestive hepatomegaly caused by cardiac decompensation. The appearance of hepatic lymphatic dilatation and surrounding lymphedema needs to be recognized so that lymphatic dilatation is not mistaken for dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.\r"

Rats were examined before and after IV administration of either gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA), ferrite particles, or both contrast agents together. Pyogenic liver abscesses appeared hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Bolus administration of Gd-DTPA using a fast spin-echo sequence with repetition time of 250 msec and echo time of 20 msec (SE 250/20) showed transient selective enhancement of normal hepatic tissue and increased lesion conspicuity, quantitatively assessed by the contrast-to-noise ratio, which increased from -35.7 to -59.0. Delayed leakage of Gd-DTPA into the abscess center partially obscured small lesions at 30-60 min. Ferrite particles reduced the signal intensity of normal liver, and the abscess then appeared homogenously hyperintense. Applying the SE 500/32 sequence, the contrast-to-noise ratio increased from -1.2 to +74.0. Coordinated administration of both contrast agents showed a further increase in contrast to +94.0, with a hyperintense abscess rim surrounded by hypointense liver. Gd-DTPA increases abscess-liver contrast by rim enhancement of the abscess wall, and ferrite increases the abscess-liver contrast by selectively decreasing the signal intensity of surrounding normal liver. As a result of increased contrast-to-noise ratio, both contrast agents, alone or in combination, increase the conspicuity of hepatic abscesses.\r"

When lesions were classified according to age of the stricture, status of vascular supply, and other etiologic factors contributing to formation, the following findings were evident: transluminal dilatation was successful in 30 (91%) of 33 patients with fresh strictures in whom there was no evidence of compromised vascular supply; in 23 (53%) of 43 similar strictures older than 3 months; in 3 (25%) of 12 with fresh strictures with evidence of vascular compromise; and in 7 (18%) of 39 with similar older strictures. Regardless of age of stricture and other etiologic factors, transluminal dilatation was successful in 53 (70%) of 76 patients with strictures without evidence of ischemic compromise but was successful in only 10 (20%) of 51 with strictures with evidence of devitalization. These findings emphasize the importance of considering both the age and vascular supply of a stricture and adjacent ureter when making the decision about treatment by antegrade transluminal dilatation.\r"

Currently, decisions regarding the management of patients are made on the basis of clinical staging that has an error rate of 34-39% (when surgical staging is used as the standard). To investigate the value of MR in staging patients with IB cervical cancer, we performed prospective MR examinations in 27 patients who had cervical carcinoma. Of these, 10 were clinically staged as having IB cervical carcinoma and underwent radical hysterectomy, providing specimens for pathologic correlation. In six of these 10 patients, the extent of disease had been underestimated during clinical examination under anesthesia. These six patients would have received radiation therapy before surgery had the MR information been used at the treatment-planning stage. MR imaging correlated better with surgical pathology than did clinical examination under anesthesia in determining the location and extent of tumor. MR imaging should be used in conjunction with clinical staging to determine appropriate therapy in patients with stage IB cervical carcinoma.\r"

The MR features were compared with descriptions in the literature and correlated with previously described surgical and postmortem findings and with the results of previous radiologic investigations in this group of patients. Several new observations were apparent from the MR examinations. In 75% of the 20 cases, the underdeveloped tentorium with a wide incisura allowed inferior displacement of the medial posterior cerebrum, which appeared closely applied to a flattened aspect of the superior cerebellum. Previously reported CT descriptions of \"pseudotumor of the tentorium\" and \"towering cerebellum\" may be more related to the technique of the radiologic examination than to true upward herniation of the cerebellum. Elongation of the mesencephalon with increase in the mamillopontine distance was present in the majority of our cases and has not been previously emphasized. Some patients had atypical changes or appeared to be borderline cases between the Chiari I and Chiari II categories of malformation, and MR provided considerable diagnostic assistance in these cases. The noninvasive, in vivo evaluation of MR contributed a great deal to our further understanding of this congenital Chiari malformation.\r"

They are hyperintense on T1-weighted images owing to methemoglobin, but have variable intensities on T2-weighted images. Observation of the different high-field spin-echo MR intensity patterns of five subacute hematomas suggests that further subcategorization into different methemoglobin states may be possible. In particular, undiluted intracellular methemoglobin is hyperintense on T1-weighted images and markedly hypointense on T2-weighted images, undiluted free methemoglobin should be hyperintense on T1-weighted images and isointense or slightly hypointense on T2-weighted images, and dilute free methemoglobin is hyperintense on both T1- and T2-weighted images. However, it appears that certain regions of subacute hematomas may be difficult to differentiate, by intensity patterns alone, from melanotic melanomas or fat. We believe that, despite some limitations, MR is useful in dividing subacute intracranial hematomas into their respective methemoglobin states, and also that further subcategorization is possible.\r"

Included in this group are agyria, pachygyria, polymicrogyria, unilateral megalencephaly, schizencephaly, and gray matter heterotopias. Patients who have these conditions present clinically with developmental delay and seizures, and abnormal motor skills are noted in the more severely affected infants. To determine the utility of MR as a method for imaging in these patients, we used MR to evaluate 13 patients who had the full spectrum of migration anomalies. MR was more sensitive than CT in detecting these anomalies because of its better contrast between gray and white matter. We found that MR was particularly more sensitive in detecting schizencephaly, where recognizing the presence of gray matter lining the cleft is critical to distinguishing that disease from porencephaly, and in detecting polymicrogyria, where critical details of cortical architecture are obscured on CT by the overlying bone. Multiplanar capabilities were also found to be essential, since narrow clefts may not be detected when the imaging plane is parallel to the cleft. MR should be the primary imaging method for infants who have seizures or developmental delay.\r"

The critical PET-FDG feature was focal hypometabolism in the area of necrosis, which contrasted with the hypermetabolism associated with the residual/recurrent tumor. In addition, four cases of cerebral necrosis after supraophthalmic, intraarterial chemotherapy (BCNU) were studied with the PET-FDG method. The area of chemotherapy damage was also characterized by marked hypometabolism. Histology revealed both similarities and differences between radio- and chemonecrosis.\r"

  ".W": "The process by which research becomes generally disseminated knowledge in radiology was studied by an analysis of reference citations. A citation is the event that occurs when one paper is listed as a reference by another paper. Analysis of the citations received by 30 diagnostic radiology journals in 1985 showed that five journals received 73% of the citations. Approximately half of the citations were made to papers over 5 years old. Analysis of the citations received by the 1977 issues of eight journals over a 9-year period showed a rapid rise in the number of citations received, a peak in the third year after publication, and a slow, exponential decline. Analysis of citations to a group of individual papers showed that 10% of the papers received nearly 50% of the citations. This information suggests that citations to the radiology literature are concentrated among a handful of papers in a few journals. The citation activities of individual journals reflect in part their editorial policies. Parameters of citation activity may be relevant to selecting journals for subscription, reading, or publication. The radiology literature has lasting relevance and receives citations for many years. Advancement of the science of radiology follows the lead of a very few works; the most frequently cited papers concern practical techniques and procedures.\r"

  ".W": "The clinical efficacy and physicians' assessment of a medical image management system (MIMS) for chest images that involved the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and the radiology department were evaluated. A token-passing fiber-optic network was implemented to connect display stations in the MICU and in the chest reading area in the radiology department with a laser film digitizer and an archiving system. To study the clinical efficacy of this system, blocks of 8 weeks during which portable chest images were digitized and immediately made available in the MICU were alternated with blocks of 8 weeks during which film images only were available. Approximately 3000 portable chest examinations were tracked; patients were entered into the study at a rate of 65 per month. Data on time intervals associated with the examination process were collected from MICU physicians, radiologists, radiographers, and film librarians. The time from the completion of an examination to the time an action was taken that was based on radiographic findings showed significant reductions during the digital periods for certain actions. For example, the time to begin drug therapy decreased from a mean of 4.7 hr when films were viewed to a mean of 3.3 hr when digital images were viewed. In conclusion, if prompt action by the MICU physician improves a patient's outcome, a positive effect on patient care will result from the immediate availability of radiographic images.\r"

  ".W": "The influence of (1) calcium concentration, (2) exposure technique, (3) reconstruction algorithm, (4) nodule size, and (5) nodule location on the CT attenuation values (CT density) of pulmonary nodules was examined in a frozen human thorax. Nodules with calcium concentrations of 0-310 mg/ml and diameters of either 0.95 or 1.59 cm were inserted into a frozen, unembalmed human thorax. The nodules were placed either at the lung apex or 4 cm below the tracheal carina. Each nodule was scanned on a GE CT 9800 scanner; five different exposure techniques were used. The slice thickness was uniformly 1.5 mm. As expected, increasing the kilovoltage caused a significant decrease in CT nodule density in all nodules with calcium concentrations greater than 80 mg/ml. The inverse relationship between kilovoltage and nodule density was exaggerated with increasing calcium concentration. A high-resolution (bone) algorithm gave a significantly higher CT number than did a smoothed (standard) algorithm, regardless of nodule size and location, but this difference could be attributed almost entirely to the edge-enhancement effect of the bone algorithm. The CT density of the larger nodules was significantly higher than that of the smaller nodules at calcium concentrations greater than 65 mg/ml for both standard and bone algorithms. Densities were significantly higher in the mid lung than in the apex with a standard algorithm, but this was not the case with a bone algorithm. The GE CT 9800 scanner had a linear response between CT density and increasing calcium concentration within the confines of a human thorax. A high-resolution (bone) reconstruction algorithm has higher spatial resolution but does show an edge-enhancing effect not found with the smoothed algorithm. Two major variables in CT densitometry for pulmonary nodules are the kilo electron voltage of the X-ray beam and the reconstruction algorithm used; these two parameters should be standardized, with a high kilovoltage and high-resolution algorithm favored on the GE CT 9800 scanner.\r"

A total of 12 patients had surgery after radiologic evaluation. There were six surgical successes and six failures. No successes occurred in patients with a soft-palate length of less than 46 mm, nor were there any successes among patients whose initial point of obstruction on fluoroscopy was inferior to the level of the soft palate. There was one surgical failure among patients in whom fluoroscopy showed upper airway obstruction beginning at the level of the soft palate during sleep. Results suggest that a patient is most likely to benefit from soft-palate resection if the soft palate is long--we conservatively suggest greater than 40 mm--and if sleep fluoroscopy of the lateral pharynx shows airway obstruction beginning at the level of the soft palate.\r"

  ".W": "Pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs of 160 patients who had had percutaneous needle biopsy of lung lesions were reviewed to determine the value of these examinations in estimating the risk of postbiopsy pneumothorax. Chest radiographs were evaluated subjectively for changes of obstructive and restrictive airway disease and for size and depth of lesion. Pulmonary function tests, consisting of simple spirometry (forced vital capacity, percentage of predicted forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 sec, and [forced expiratory in 1 sec/forced vital capacity] X 100), and the pulmonologist's interpretation were evaluated. Pneumothorax developed in 46% (31/67) of patients who had obstructive airway disease according to the results of pulmonary function tests and in 42% (34/81) of those who had obstructive airway disease according to changes on chest radiographs, compared with 19% (10/53) and 25% (17/67) of those who had normal pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs, respectively. Pneumothorax developed in 46% (23/50) of patients who had findings of obstructive airway disease on both pulmonary function tests and on chest radiographs, compared with 7% (2/28) of patients who were classified as normal by both criteria. None of the patients who had normal pulmonary function tests required placement of a chest tube, whereas 19% (13/67) of those who had obstructive airway disease required chest tubes. Decreasing size of lesion and increasing depth of lesion were associated with a significant increase in the risk of pneumothorax. We conclude that the results of chest radiographs and pulmonary function tests are useful parameters for estimating the risk of postbiopsy pneumothorax.\r"

Retrospective review of MR studies in 45 patients without evidence of pericardial disease showed the transverse sinus of the pericardium in 80% (32/40) of transverse ECG-gated images, 78% (7/9) of sagittal ECG-gated images, and 67% (14/21) of coronal ECG-gated images. Nongated studies showed the sinus infrequently.

  ".W": "MR imaging is known to be an effective technique for the noninvasive diagnosis of thoracic aortic disease, but it has not been used to monitor the appearance of the aorta or the fate of the false lumen after surgery for aortic dissection. This study describes our initial experience with postsurgical MR imaging of aortic dissection (nine type A and two type B) to evaluate prognostically important features, including the status of residual false lumen. The most notable findings were (1) aneurysmal dilatation beyond the interposed graft (11/11 cases), (2) residual intimal flap (10/11 cases) with at least partial patency of the false lumen (10/10 cases), and (3) origin of a visceral vessel from the false lumen in persistently dissected abdominal aorta (6/9 cases). Evaluation of residual false lumen by double-spin-echo-intensity and phase-display techniques showed evidence of slow blood flow with variable amounts of thrombus in eight of 10 cases. Differentiation between signal within the false lumen due to slow flow and signal due to thrombus was facilitated by phase display. MR imaging can be used for noninvasive monitoring of the aorta after surgical repair of aortic dissection. Since the false lumen usually remains patent after surgical repair, such follow-up of its status seems necessary for identifying potential complications of the original dissection and/or the therapy.\r"

The group included five patients with coagulopathy, three with pancreatic carcinoma, two with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, one with pancreatitis, and one with hepatocellular carcinoma. In two patients, no etiology was determined. In all cases, CT easily identified low-density venous thrombosis, which frequently involved more than one vein. In four patients, all three splanchnic veins were involved; five patients had occlusion of two veins. In five patients, only one vein was involved. Additional CT findings included ascites, collateral veins, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. No venous wall enhancement was found. CT also was helpful in defining the cause of thrombosis in six of 14 patients. Mesenteric edema and/or bowel wall thickening was not identified. None of the patients had classic clinical evidence of splanchnic venous occlusion, and none died primarily of that disease. The major morbidity suffered by these patients stemmed from complications of splanchnic venous occlusion, and nine patients ultimately required sclerotherapy, splenectomy, and portal decompression. We conclude that CT is useful in the diagnosis of splanchnic venous thrombosis. Our experience suggests that mesenteric, splenic, and/or portal venous thrombosis may occur more commonly than has been previously thought and that the disease in many cases is not life threatening.\r"

  ".W": "A blinded, retrospective study was performed to determine the role of double-contrast esophagography in diagnosing Barrett's esophagus. The study group consisted of 200 patients who had double-contrast esophagrams and endoscopy because of severe reflux symptoms. The radiographs were reviewed by two gastrointestinal radiologists who had no knowledge of the endoscopic findings. Patients were classified as being at high risk for Barrett's esophagus if the radiographs revealed a high stricture or ulcer or a reticular mucosal pattern; at moderate risk if the radiographs revealed a distal peptic stricture and/or reflux esophagitis; and at low risk if none of the aforementioned findings were present. When these radiologic criteria were used, 10 patients (5%) were thought to be at high risk, 73 (37%) at moderate risk, and 117 (58%) at low risk for Barrett's esophagus. Endoscopic correlation revealed biopsy-proved Barrett's mucosa in nine (90%) of 10 patients at high risk, in 12 (16%) of 73 at moderate risk, and in only one (1%) of 117 at low risk for Barrett's esophagus. Thus, endoscopy is clearly indicated for patients in the high-risk group. Because of the lower prevalence of Barrett's esophagus in the moderate-risk group, clinical judgment should be used in deciding when to perform endoscopy in these patients. However, most patients were in the low-risk group, and the prevalence of Barrett's esophagus was so low in this group that endoscopy does not appear to be warranted. Thus, the major value of double-contrast esophagography is its ability to separate patients into high-, moderate-, and low-risk groups for Barrett's esophagus to determine the relative need for endoscopy and biopsy.\r"

  ".W": "Extensive immunologic surface marker analyses and binding competition assays demonstrated that B43 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) is a new member of the CD19 cluster that recognizes the same surface epitope as several other anti-CD19 MoAbs. We used B43 MoAb to test for CD19 expression on neoplastic cells from 340 leukemia and 151 malignant lymphoma patients and on nonneoplastic cells in normal lymphohematopoietic and nonlymphohematopoietic tissues. Our study more than doubles the total number of cases with classified hematologic malignancies that have been examined for CD19 antigen expression. The data presented confirm that CD19 is the most reliable B lineage surface marker and support our view that this B lineage-restricted surface determinant may be an important functional receptor. Our findings provide unique and direct evidence that (a) CD19 is expressed on leukemic B lineage lymphoid progenitor cells freshly obtained from B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients but not on normal myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, or multilineage bone marrow progenitor cells; (b) ligation of CD19 with B43 MoAb induces sustained increases in [Ca2+]i when crosslinked and inhibits high-molecular weight B cell growth factor (HMW-BCGF)-induced proliferation of activated B cells without affecting their low-molecular weight B cell growth factor (LMW-BCGF) response; therefore CD19 may be a unique signal receptor; (c) HMW-BCGF and LMW-BCGF augment expression of CD19, which suggests that CD19 and BCGF receptors may be under coordinate regulatory control; (d) approximately two million B43 MoAb molecules per cell can be bound to target B lineage lymphoma cells with a Ka of 1.9 x 10(8)/mol/L; (e) CD19 can undergo B43 MoAb-induced internalization; and (f) the opportunity is thus provided for using anti-CD19 MoAb to deliver toxins to B lineage neoplastic cells for more effective treatment of high-risk leukemia/lymphoma patients.\r"

The present studies were carried out to determine whether products of stimulated monocytes activated circulating neutrophils (PMN) to increase expression of receptors for C3b (CR1) and C3bi (CR3), which are necessary for optimal margination, migration, and phagocytosis. Supernatants of human mononuclear cells that had been stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or purified protein derivative (PPD) contained both tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1 and increased CR1 and CR3 expression on isolated PMNs. Supernatants of unstimulated cultures, media alone, or LPS or PPD alone had little or no effect. Supernatant effects were detectable at 1:3,000 final dilution and appeared to have a characteristic slow time course. These supernatants also caused dose- and time-dependent secretion of PMN granular constituents, but maximal receptor expression was accompanied by secretion of less than 10% of the cells' content of lysozyme and less than 16% of the B12 binding protein. Immunoadsorption studies showed that the supernatant's activity could be removed by anti-TNF but not by anti-IL-1. Recombinant IL-1 had no effect on receptor expression, but recombinant TNF increased CR1 and CR3 expression with kinetics similar to the supernatants. These results thus indicate that TNF is the major monocyte product that increases CR1 and CR3 expression on mature blood neutrophils. This would result in increased margination and phagocytic activity and may be an important systemic effect that would help the host eradicate infection.\r"

Alteration in the structure of G-CSF (two instances) and GM-CSF (two instances) was found. In two patients in whom it was possible to study DNA from bone marrow obtained at remission, the new bands detected in the leukemic cells were not found. Fifteen of 18 patients showed no RNA expression of either growth factor. Both patients with GM-CSF abnormalities as seen by Southern analysis expressed an abnormally large GM-CSF message but no G-CSF messages. One patient with an abnormal Southern pattern with G-CSF expressed normal-sized G-CSF and GM-CSF messages. The biologic significance of these findings remains to be determined. Nonetheless, the abnormal Southern patterns may prove to be useful clonal markers in the study of AML.\r"

  ".W": "An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in biologic fluids was developed on the basis of two murine monoclonal antibodies raised against PAI-1 purified from HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells. The lower limit of sensitivity of the assay in plasma is 2 ng/mL. The assay is 12 times less sensitive toward the PAI-1/human tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) complex as compared with free PAI-1. The intraassay, interassay, and interdilution coefficients of variation are 5.2%, 8.0%, and 7.1%, respectively. The level of PAI-1 in platelet-poor plasma of healthy subjects is 18 +/- 10 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, n = 45). In platelet-rich plasma after freezing and thawing, 92% of PAI-1 antigen is released from platelets, whereas only 8% is found in the corresponding platelet-poor plasma. In platelet-poor plasma from healthy subjects, a linear correlation (r = 0.80) was found between PAI activity and PAI-1 antigen. In plasma approximately two thirds of the PAI-1 antigen was functionally active, whereas only 5% of the PAI-1 antigen released from platelets was active. During pregnancy a progressive increase of PAI-1 antigen levels up to three- to sixfold the control value was observed. In plasma of patients with recurrent deep vein thrombosis, PAI-1 levels were 44 +/- 20 ng/mL (mean +/- SD, n = 7), during a clinically silent phase. Four of these patients had a level above 38 ng/mL (mean +/- 2 SD of normal). The present assay, based on stable and reproducible reagents, allows the specific determination of PAI-1 antigen in biologic fluids. It may facilitate interlaboratory comparisons and be useful for further investigations of the role of PAI-1 in clinical conditions associated with impaired fibrinolysis and/or a tendency to thrombosis and investigations of the role of PAI-1 in platelets.\r"

The patients were given CSFHU at a dose of 6 x 10(6) U/m2/d for seven consecutive days, and their peripheral neutrophil counts were serially followed for 6 to 12 months. In addition, changes in bone marrow morphology and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFUs) were studied. Transient increases in neutrophil counts occurred during the first 4 weeks in all patients except one. Repeated increases were seen in a cyclic fashion in five patients. Three of the patients recovered from the neutropenia after several cycles of fluctuation of neutrophil counts; the counts (per microliter) reached 5,880, 5,640, and 2,000 as compared with pretreatment levels (mean +/- 2 SD) of 80 +/- 164, 182 +/- 250, and 2 +/- 14, respectively. The percentage (mean +/- SE) of marrow neutrophilic cells increased from 30.4% +/- 7.0% to 34.9% +/- 6.9% (P less than .05) and the ratio of the later neutrophil precursors to the earlier ones from 1.02 +/- 0.27 to 1.42 +/- 0.36 (P less than .02) 2 weeks after CSFHU infusion. There were no changes in GM-CFU numbers. These results indicate that CSFHU can increase neutrophil counts by increasing the number and maturity of the marrow neutrophil precursors in some types of childhood chronic neutropenia.\r"

The T alpha and complete T beta gene transcripts were not detected, but a 1.0-kilobase T beta gene transcript could be demonstrated at low levels in freshly isolated cells and at a much higher level in interleukin-2 (IL-2)-cultured cells. The transcript coding for the delta chain of the CD3 complex was also absent. These cells were cultured in IL-2 with or without the addition of the differentiation-inducing agents: retinoic acid, N,N-hexamethylene bisacetamide, and sodium butyrate. The cultured cells retained their NK activity except in culture with sodium butyrate at greater than or equal to 1 mmol/L. Expression of CD3 or other T cell surface markers by the NK cells was not observed in these cultures. Either CD2+, CD3- NK cells are derived from a non-T lineage, or they have diverged from the T cell lineage earlier than the stage of T gamma gene rearrangement and CD3 delta chain expression; they are refractory to many induction signals in undergoing further T cell differentiation.\r"

This study examined whether dCF and recombinant interferon-alpha A (rIFN-alpha A) were additive, synergistic, or antagonistic in their effects on the cultured B lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi. Treatment of Daudi cells for three to four days with doses of rIFN-alpha A that were growth inhibitory was unexpectedly found to increase the level of ADA activity per cell two- to threefold and therefore to prevent the inhibition of ADA by limiting concentrations of dCF. However, the opposite effects of dCF and rIFN-alpha A on ADA activity did not lead to antagonistic effects on growth inhibition. The higher concentrations of dCF (with deoxyadenosine) necessary for appreciable growth inhibition could inhibit the increased ADA activity in rIFN-alpha A-treated cells, thus resulting in additive antiproliferative effects.\r"

In two kindreds with mild lifelong bleeding symptoms transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait, all ten symptomatic members (but none of the five asymptomatic members) had a supranormal multimeric structure for plasma VWF, apparently identical to that seen for postdesmopressin normal plasma. Plasma factor VIII coagulant activity (VIII:C), VWF antigen (VWF:Ag), ristocetin-induced platelet agglutination, and ristocetin cofactor (RiCof) activity were low. Platelet VWF:Ag and RiCof levels (tested for three patients only) were normal. Bleeding times were normal or slightly prolonged. The patients' platelet multimeric structure was the same as that for normal platelets. After desmopressin infusion the plasma VWF multimeric structure remained supranormal as for preinfusion plasma, with VIII:C VWF:Ag and RiCof increasing markedly over baseline values and disappearing at a normal rate. Examination of the VWF subunit composition from three of these patients indicated that proteolytic processing of their VWF did not differ from normal. This study describes the first variant of VWD with a supranormal multimeric structure.\r"

We studied the release and recovery events of human mast cell secretion stimulated by antibody to immunoglobulin E. We used enzymatically digested mast cells from human lung specimens further purified by countercurrent centrifugation elutriation. Release kinetics were like those reported for isolated human lung mast cells. In two complete kinetic experiments we restudied these early release patterns (0 to 30 minutes). Mast cells, either stimulated or controls, were then cultured and sampled for electronmicroscopic studies at periodic intervals (3 to 48 hours). We describe events of the late recovery period here, although some overlap with processes seen in early recovery samples occurred. Mast cells that released nearly all their cytoplasmic granules and exteriorized the containers, eg, granule-channel membranes, underwent progressive enlargement of Golgi structures and development of numerous small cytoplasmic vesicles and small, membrane-bound granules filled with particulate and dense content. Ultimately, new mature cytoplasmic granules of all substructural patterns occurred. Nuclear blast changes and expansion of cytoplasmic mass accompanied this period of new granule synthesis. Mixed recovery patterns were present in individual cells. These represented the morphological expression of a variety of recovery events. Thus, some cells showed a combination of channel recovery and remodeling to form new granule containers within which condensation of content produced crystalline patterns, as well as synthesis of new granules, as described here. This morphological versatility resulted in multiple mast cell morphological phenotypes during these release and recovery processes.\r"

Fc epsilon R, recently identified as CD23, are known to be expressed on the surface of B cells at the intermediate stage of differentiation. The results indicate that in all cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) tested (n = 40), IgE-BF levels (45 to 8,656 U/mL) were 3-fold to 500-fold higher than in 24 controls (15.5 +/- 2 U/mL). With a few exceptions, serum IgE-BF levels could differentiate patients with CLL from those with other leukemias or lymphomas. In vitro studies indicated that B lymphocytes isolated from CLL patients produced 8 to 50 times more IgE-BF than did normal B cells (P less than 0.001). IgE-BF level was correlated with the Rai stage of the disease (P = 0.002) and the lymphocyte count (P = 0.041). IgE-BF was purified to homogeneity from one CLL serum sample by a combination of affinity chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). this IgE-BF proved identical to IgE-BF isolated from the culture supernatant of RPMI 8866 cells, a B lymphoblastoid cell line bearing Fc epsilon R and secreting IgE-BF. Indeed, the two molecules had the same mol wt (25 to 27 kd), the same isoelectric point, and the same tryptic map. We suggest that determination of serum IgE-BF might prove useful for clinical monitoring of CLL.\r"

  ".W": "Cultured mononuclear phagocytes produce soluble factors that stimulate endothelial cells to release GM-colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA). One such factor was recently identified as interleukin 1 (IL 1). Studies were designed to determine which types of granulopoietic factors are released by IL 1-stimulated endothelial cells. Supernatants from endothelial cells cultured for 3 days in medium containing IL 1 alpha and beta were tested in both murine and human CFU-GM colony growth assays. The effect of conditioned media on differentiation of WEHI-3B myelomonocytic leukemic cells was also examined. Control media containing IL 1 alone or unstimulated endothelial cell-conditioned media contained no detectable CSA in any bioassay. Medium conditioned by IL 1-stimulated endothelial cells stimulated the clonal growth of both human and murine CFU-GM and induced macrophage differentiation of WEHI-3B cells. Treatment of these conditioned media with a highly specific neutralizing monoclonal G-CSF antibody completely inhibited their activity in the murine CFU-GM assay, but only partially inhibited GM colony growth by human marrow. Treatment of the active conditioned media with a neutralizing rabbit anti-human GM-CSF antibody partially reduced the activity of the media in the human GM-colony growth assay. G-CSF radioimmunoassay of endothelial cell culture supernatants and Northern blot analysis of endothelial cell cytoplasmic RNA for GM-CSF gene transcripts confirmed that IL 1 induced expression of both G-CSF and GM-CSF genes. Because treatment of media with both antibodies abrogated all activity in the human GM colony growth assay, we conclude that IL 1-stimulated endothelial cells release both G and GM-CSF and that these are the only granulopoietic factors detectable in clonogenic assays released by these cells in vitro.\r"

However, in all instances the large majority of HCLC were unexpectedly stained with an antibody (anti-CD1a) usually detectable only in early thymocytes and on Langerhans cells. This finding was further confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. This type of ambiguity in the lineage of HCL could imply that HCLC might arise from cells differentiated towards the B-cell lineage, still sustaining an early antigen of a different (T) lineage. These results, moreover, extend the range of the known distribution of the CD1a antigen, which could be useful in diagnosing HCL.\r"

Both MoAb anti-CD5 and anti-CD2 yielded favorable mean tumor to whole-body ratios of 3.8 and 5.1, respectively. These ratios were further increased up to 10.0 for MoAb anti-CD5 and 15.5 for MoAb anti-CD2 by using their F(ab')2 fragments. The tumors could be imaged clearly by external scanning after injection of F(ab')2 fragments from both MoAb. F(ab')2 fragments from MoAb anti-CD2 and of a third MoAb recognizing the clonotypic determinant (Ti) of the antigen receptor expressed by the human T-cell line Jurkat were injected in mice bearing intrasplenic Jurkat xenografts. A selective localization of both fragments in tumor tissue was demonstrated with mean tumor to whole-body ratios of 7.5 and 4.1 for MoAb anti-CD2 and anti-Ti, respectively.

Immunophenotyping of the lymphomatous infiltration disclosed a cell antigen profile with pre-pre-B (HLA-DR+, CALLA+, VIB-C5+), pre-B (HLADR+, CALLA+, VIB-C5+, cytoplasmatic immunoglobulin+), and transitional pre-B characteristics (HLA-DR+, CALLA+, VIB-C5+, surface immunoglobulin+). The morphology of the blast cells in all patients showed features of lymphoblastic lymphoma. Two patients had the convoluted cell type in common, but they were immunologically different, one displaying pre-pre-B and the other pre-B immunophenotypes. The remaining two cases were diagnosed as lymphoblastic lymphomas \"type others\" according to the Kiel Classification, one with pre-B and the other with transitional pre-B characteristics. The morphologic and immunohistochemical parameters as well as the clinical data from the four cases clearly indicate the heterogeneity of cutaneous non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in children.\r"

  ".W": "alpha 1-Adrenoceptor stimulation of rat left ventricular papillary muscles by phenylephrine in the presence of propranolol resulted in rapid breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI-4,5-P2) and a triphasic inotropic response in a concentration-dependent manner. The release of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) was maximum within 30 seconds and remained high for at least 30 minutes. The IP3 formation was associated with a rapid, but small, increase in contractile force followed by a transient decline in the contractility prior to the development of a sustained and more pronounced positive inotropic response. Inhibition of PI-4,5-P2 hydrolysis by the alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin or the PI-4,5-P2 phosphodiesterase inhibitor neomycin blocked all components of the inotropic responses. Combined addition of 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid, a competitive inhibitor of IP3 phosphatase, with phenylephrine doubled the IP3 formation and potentiated the initial phases of inotropic responses but had no effect on the sustained positive inotropic response. Nifedipine and Mn2+ did not block the transient inotropic responses but inhibited the sustained positive inotropic response. alpha 1-Adrenoceptor stimulation resulted in restoration of slow responses in the high K+-depolarized muscles in the time course similar to that of the development in the sustained positive inotropic response. Addition of phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate alone or in combination with caffeine or A23187 failed to produce a sustained positive inotropic effect, but pretreatment with this phorbol ester (1-100 nM) for 30 minutes resulted in dose-dependent potentiation of alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated sustained positive inotropic effect associated with enhanced slow responses. These results suggest that the inotropic effects mediated by cardiac alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation occur through the phosphodiesteratic cleavage of PI-4,5-P2, such that IP3 may produce transient inotropic effects by mobilizing intracellular Ca2+, while diacylglycerol, along with cofactors that are also generated on alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation, may provoke a sustained positive inotropic effect by potentiating slow Ca2+ channels through activation of protein kinase C.\r"

  ".W": "Two hundred and sixteen patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with immediate infusion of high-dose (1.5 million units) intravenous streptokinase followed by emergency coronary angioplasty. The infarct lesion was crossed and dilated in 99% and persistent coronary perfusion after the procedure was achieved in 90% (including 3% with significant residual stenosis). Total in-hospital mortality was 12%. Multivariable analysis showed a higher hospital mortality with cardiogenic shock (41% vs 5% without shock), older age, lower left ventricular ejection fraction, and female sex. Final patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by follow-up in-hospital cardiac catheterization. Coronary reocclusion occurred in 11% (symptomatic in 7%, treated with emergency angioplasty or bypass surgery; silent in 4%, treated medically). Of the surviving patients with successful initial establishment of infarct vessel patency, 94% were discharged from the hospital with an open infarct artery or a bypass graft to the infarct vessel. There was significant improvement in both ejection fraction (44% to 49%; p less than .0001) and regional wall motion in the infarct zone (-3.0 SD to -2.4 SD; p less than .0001) among patients with persistent coronary perfusion and insignificant residual stenosis at the time of the follow-up cardiac catheterization. Thus, a treatment strategy for acute myocardial infarction that includes immediate administration of streptokinase followed by emergency coronary angioplasty, and coronary bypass surgery when necessary, results in a high rate of early and sustained patency of the infarct-related vessel.\r"

In men, but not women, age-adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated significantly with dietary sodium intake. In both men and women, age-adjusted diastolic blood pressure significantly inversely correlated with dietary potassium intake. Age-adjusted systolic and diastolic blood pressure correlated significantly with the dietary sodium/potassium ratio in each sex; correlations were better for the ratio than for either sodium or potassium alone. The relationship was apparent over the whole range of blood pressure and dietary intake. A marked age gradient was apparent in men, the regression slope for blood pressure vs sodium/potassium ratio increasing with increasing age, suggesting increasing sensitivity to dietary sodium/potassium ratio with age. Adjusting for intake of other dietary variables, including calories, protein, carbohydrate, saturated fat, alcohol, calcium, and fiber, did not alter the relationships; adjusting for body mass index reduced the strength of the association in women but not in men. These results support the hypothesis that dietary sodium and potassium are related to blood pressure within a population.\r"

Enalaprilat effect on arterial pulse pressure was dependent on preinjection pulse pressure (r = -0.76; P less than 0.001), but its effect on mean blood pressure was not dependent on preinjection mean blood pressure. On the other hand, enalaprilat effect on arterial blood flow was negatively correlated with preinjection blood pressure (r = -0.64; P less than 0.02). The findings point to different responses of large and small arteries to intravenous enalaprilat.\r"

Patients with elevated BAL granulocytes also had significantly higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Three of the four patients who died had the highest percentage of neutrophil counts observed in lavage fluid. Although no patient was thought to have a concurrent bacterial infection, potential pathogens were cultured from the sputum of patients with the most elevated neutrophil counts. Whether BAL granulocytes reflect an inflammatory process analogous to the adult respiratory distress syndrome or signify concomitant bacterial infection remains to be determined. We conclude that BAL granulocytes are associated with more severe respiratory compromise in patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.\r"

The value of C1q/albumin was several to 20 times greater in BALF than in serum samples from individual patients. In contrast, BALF samples from control subjects (ten patients with sarcoidosis and nine normal subjects) contained an undetectable amount (less than 0.02 micrograms/ml) of C1q. C3 in BALF also increased in the summer-type HP patients. Furthermore, C1q (as well as specific IgG and IgA antibody activities to Trichosporon cutaneum antigen) in BALF correlated with clinical symptoms and diffusing capacity (DCO), while the BAL lymphocytosis or the change of OKT4/OKT8 ratio did not. These findings are indicative of local secretion or concentration mechanism of C1q and C3, supporting the involvement of immune complexes in the respiratory tract of the patients.\r"

Enzymatically dispersed ovine luteal cells obtained on day 11 from superovulated ewes were pretreated for 1 h at 37 C with cytochalasin B (20 micrograms/ml), cytochalasin D (20 micrograms/ml), or colchicine (40 micrograms/ml). These drugs had no effect on the lateral diffusion of cell membrane glycoproteins labeled with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-derivatized succinyl Concanavalin-A. However, drug treatment caused a significant increase in the diffusion coefficient and mobile fraction of hCG-occupied LH receptors compared to values obtained on untreated cells. hCG-occupied LH receptors on untreated cells exhibited a mobile fraction of 10.3%, and these mobile complexes had a diffusion coefficient of 3.3 X 10(-11) cm2 sec-1.hCG-occupied LH receptors on cytochalasin B-treated cells had a diffusion coefficient of 9.0 X 10(-11) cm2 sec-1, with 26% fluorescence recovery. Cytochalasin D and colchicine caused significantly greater increases in hCG mobility to 22.0 and 22.5 X 10(-11) cm2 sec-1, respectively, although the mobile fraction remained at about 25-30%. That binding of hCG to the LH receptor restricts lateral mobility through interactions of the hormone-occupied receptor complex with the cytoskeleton is further indicated by results obtained on membrane blebs. The fraction of mobile hCG-occupied LH receptors on blebs was 52.3%, and complexes had a diffusion coefficient of 1.7 X 10(-10) cm2 sec-1. The hormone-induced restriction of LH receptor lateral diffusion had no effect on the lateral mobility of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-epidermal growth factor-labeled receptors.\r"

  ".W": "The rise in circulating ACTH levels after adrenalectomy in the rat is associated with a decrease in CRF receptor-binding capacity in the anterior pituitary. To investigate the role of increased hypothalamic CRF release on pituitary CRF receptor regulation after withdrawal of glucocorticoid feedback by adrenalectomy, the effects of chronic CRF infusion and lesions in the medial basal hypothalamus were studied in the rat. Subcutaneous infusion of CRF at 10, 25, 50, and 100 ng/min for 48 h in intact rats caused dose-dependent increases in plasma ACTH levels from the control value of 32.1 +/- 4.3 to 58.0 +/- 4.9, 82.0 +/- 7.1, 135.5 +/- 11.6, and 149.2 +/- 13.2 pg/ml, respectively. In contrast, the pituitary CRF receptor concentration was reduced by 25.3 +/- 4.5%, 38.3 +/- 2.5%, 43.8 +/- 0.9%, and 45.8 +/- 2.0%, respectively. Intravenous infusion of increasing doses of CRF caused a similar increase in plasma ACTH levels, which became maximum at the lowest infusion dose (32.4 +/- 5.4, 138.5 +/- 12.3, 162.0 +/- 18.3, and 167 +/- 19.1 pg/ml for control and 10, 50, and 100 ng/min CRF, respectively). Pituitary CRF receptor concentration was again decreased after iv CRF infusion [by 42 +/- 6.2% with the lowest dose (10 ng/min)], with no further reduction after infusion of 50 and 100 ng/min (49.0 +/- 6.8% and 26.0 +/- 6.2%, respectively)]. The decrease in pituitary CRF receptors after CRF infusion was accompanied by a decrease in CRF-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity, with a 10- to 100-fold increase in the concentration of CRF required for threshold stimulation. In cultured pituitary cells prepared from animals infused with 50 ng/min CRF for 48 h, maximum CRF-stimulated ACTH release was reduced by 29 +/- 3.2% (P less than 0.01; n = 3), with no significant change in sensitivity to CRF (ED50, 0.6 +/- 0.5 and 1.0 +/- 0.5 nM CRF for control and CRF infusion, respectively). The role of endogenous CRF in adrenalectomy-induced pituitary CRF receptor down-regulation was also studied in rats with medial basal hypothalamic deafferentation. The marked loss of pituitary CRF receptors after adrenalectomy was completely prevented by such hypothalamic lesioning, indicating that receptor down-regulation was dependent on the release of CRF or/and other hypothalamic factors. The data demonstrate that while increased CRF levels result in down-regulation and desensitization of pituitary CRF receptors, the differences between adrenalectomy and CRF infusion indicate that additional regulatory factors are involved in the modulation of CRF receptor content and activity after adrenalectomy.\r"

As it has been reported that homogenates of peritoneal macrophages contained substances which stimulated progesterone production by luteinized granulosa cells of mice, we examined whether IL-1 could modulate the steroidogenic functions of granulosa cells. Porcine granulosa cells obtained from medium-sized follicles were cultured with IL-1 in the presence or absence of LH, and the effects of IL-1 on LH-stimulated as well as basal progesterone production by these cells were examined. Contrary to our expectation, IL-1 markedly inhibited the LH-stimulated progesterone production in a dose-dependent manner. The morphological luteinization of the granulosa cells induced by LH was also inhibited by IL-1. In addition to effects on LH-induced differentiation, IL-1 exhibited an inhibitory effect on basal (unstimulated) progesterone production as well. The ovarian granulosa cell was identified as one of the possible targets for IL-1, and it was shown for the first time that IL-1 can modulate steroidogenic functions of mammalian cells in culture.\r"

To determine whether KZ similarly affects ovarian steroidogenesis, the authors examined its effect on the activity of the human ovarian 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3 beta-HSD), 17-hydroxylase (17-OH), and aromatase (AR) in vitro. A dose-dependent decrease in the activities of 3 beta-HSD and 17-OH was observed with increasing amounts of KZ. With 10, 50, and 100-fold excess KZ, the activity of 3 beta-HSD decreased by 59% (P less than 0.001), 73% (P less than 0.005), and 85% (P less than 0.005), respectively. At equimolar concentrations with substrate (50 microM), KZ inhibited 17-OH by 70% (P less than 0.01). No significant effect on ovarian AR activity was observed, except at the highest concentration of KZ tested. The authors conclude that low concentrations of KZ profoundly inhibit the activity of human ovarian 3 beta-HSD and 17-OH in vitro. These observations suggest that KZ might be useful in the medical management of women with hyperandrogenism, but further experimentation and clinical trials will be necessary.\r"

Removal of the mucoid cap that formed after application of the NaCl did not cause a reduction of the protective effects. Similarly, pretreatment with indomethacin did not reverse the protection, despite causing a 77% inhibition of gastric cyclooxygenase activity. The present study confirms that the application of an irritant to the gastric mucosa results in a significant increase in the resistance of the mucosa to hemorrhagic damage induced by ethanol. Although the mucoid cap that forms after irritation of the mucosa may play a role in promoting restitution, it does not appear to be responsible for the resistance to hemorrhagic necrosis. Prostaglandin synthesis by the gastric mucosa also does not appear to play a major role in the mechanism of adaptive cytoprotection.\r"

The present investigation was undertaken to examine the effect and the mechanism of action of CGRP on the lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal contractions. This peptide caused dose-dependent relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. The D50 for inhibitory effect of intraarterial CGRP on the sphincter was 5.0 X 10(-13) mol/kg. Calcitonin gene-related peptide is 3000 times more potent than calcitonin. The effect of CGRP on the lower esophageal sphincter was partially antagonized by tetrodotoxin or black widow spider venom. The inhibitory effect of CGRP on the sphincter appears to be exerted at two levels: (a) at the sphincteric smooth muscle, and (b) at the noncholinergic, nonadrenergic inhibitory neurons. Calcitonin gene-related peptide also exerts a potent inhibitory effect on the peristaltic contraction of the esophageal body in response to swallowing and vagal efferent stimulation. Using immunohistochemical studies we also showed the presence of CGRP-immunoreactive neurons within the myenteric ganglia of the esophagus. These studies suggest that CGRP may play an important role as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the esophagus.\r"

  ".W": "To study antigen-specific immune responses of gut-associated T lymphocytes after gastrointestinal infection, Cynomolgus monkeys were inoculated rectally with Chlamydia trachomatis of the L2 [lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)] strain. Infected monkeys developed a chronic proctitis with the appearance of LGV-specific immunoglobulin G-antibodies in the serum. Lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood, the spleen, and draining lymph nodes had a vigorous antigen-specific proliferative response to LGV in vitro. Both T and B cells proliferated in response to stimulation with LGV, but B-cell proliferation was T-cell-dependent, as shown by cell separation techniques and cell-cycle analysis with dual-laser flow cytometry. Lymphocytes isolated from both involved and uninvolved lamina propria did not proliferate in response to LGV stimulation, whereas mitogen-induced proliferation was not different in lamina propria lymphocytes and the other lymphocyte populations. This lack of antigen-specific proliferation was not caused by a suppressor effect of mucosal T cells or monocytes or the absence of antigen-presenting cells. In contrast, lamina propria T lymphocytes from infected animals were able to provide antigen-specific help for polyclonal immunoglobulin synthesis by immune B lymphocytes after stimulation with LGV. Thus, in LGV proctitis in monkeys, mucosal antigen-reactive T cells differ from lymphocytes in other sites in that they can provide helper function, but are not able to proliferate in response to LGV antigens.\r"

There were no differences in EGF concentrations between the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle (P greater than 0.05). Normal menstruating women had higher urinary EGF concentrations [mean +/- SE, 37.2 +/- 6.0 micrograms/g creatinine (4.23 +/- 0.68 ng/mumol)] than women with tubal sterilization [32.7 +/- 4.0 (3.71 +/- 0.45)] or women taking a low dose oral contraceptive [19.5 +/- 6.0 (2.21 +/- 0.68)], but the differences were not significant (P greater than 0.05). During pregnancy, urinary EGF concentrations increased linearly from 6-20 weeks gestation (r = 0.76; P less than 0.001), then declined toward term (r = -0.71; P less than 0.001).

Urinary EGF concentrations in women delivering normal AGA infants [52.7 +/- 2.5 (5.98 +/- 0.28); n = 16] did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) from those in women with class A/B diabetes [41.9 +/- 2.8 (4.76 +/- 0.31); n = 6] or women delivering twins [45.6 +/- 2.6 (5.18 +/- 0.29); n = 8] with a greater fetoplacental mass.

The significance of the rise in the urinary EGF concentration late in the second trimester and lower urinary EGF concentrations in women delivering intrauterine growth-retarded infants is not known, but may reflect an important physiological role for EGF in fetal-maternal hormonal interaction and development.\r"

Five micrograms of ACTH, sc, was the lowest dose that significantly increased plasma levels of the three steroids. CRH (30 micrograms, iv) increased plasma cortisol and 18-hydroxycorticosterone, but not aldosterone, while 100 micrograms CRH also raised aldosterone secretion. The dose-response curve (peak plasma ACTH level vs. maximum increment of plasma cortisol within the first hour) was initially very steep. Plasma ACTH levels between 50 and 60 ng/L (11-13 pmol/L) stimulated cortisol to almost 80% of the maximal increment obtained with plasma ACTH levels above 300 ng/L (greater than 66 pmol/L). This dose-response relationship is similar to that found in clinical tests of the pituitary-adrenal axis (insulin test, metyrapone test). The effects of plasma ACTH released by CRH on cortisol secretion were not significantly different from those of injected ACTH. Our results argue against the hypothesis that the effect of CRH on steroid secretion is mediated or modulated by POMC-derived peptides other than ACTH.\r"

This stimulation was not CRH dependent, and the presence of CRH alone did not augment cortisol production. The active factor was soluble, since supernatants of monocyte cultures stimulated cortisol production by adrenocortical cells; ACTH levels in these supernatants were undetectable by RIA. While interleukin-1 also stimulated cortisol production by adrenal cells, the degree of stimulation was only 30% of that in the monocyte experiments. In contrast to previous animal studies, we found that human monocytes stimulate cortisol production by human adrenocortical cells by a factor that is neither CRH dependent nor mediated by immunoreactive ACTH-(1-24) or ACTH-(1-39).\r"

To determine the mechanism(s) of this inhibition, adherent human blood monocytes were stimulated with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (10 micrograms/ml) in the presence of dexamethasone. Nuclear transcription run-off assays showed that LPS induced IL-1 beta gene transcription two- to fourfold and that this induction was unaffected by dexamethasone exposure (10(-5) M). The lack of dexamethasone's transcriptional effects was further supported by the absence of any significant change in IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation between LPS-stimulated monocytes exposed or unexposed to dexamethasone, as determined by Northern blot analysis. Posttranscriptionally, dexamethasone was found to have multiple effects: slight prolongation of IL-1 beta mRNA half-life, moderate inhibition of translation of the IL-1 beta precursor, and profound inhibition of the release of IL-1 beta into the extracellular fluid. The data indicate that IL-1 beta is first translated as the 33,000-D pro-IL-1 beta protein, the predominant intracellular form, and the processed to a 17,500-D IL-1 beta protein before or during extracellular transport. The major inhibitory effects of dexamethasone appear to be directed at the translational and posttranslational steps involved in these events.\r"

We examined L-system transport in chronic leukemic B lymphocytes after incubation with tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate to determine if the transport abnormality can be corrected by the apparent cell maturation induced by this agent. Amino acid uptake was measured using 2-amino-2-carboxy-bicycloheptane, an L-system specific synthetic amino acid. Marked enhancement of L-system transport occurred in each of 12 leukemic cell populations; the initial velocity of transport in phorbol ester-treated cells increased 8-fold and 14-fold at 16 and 40 h, respectively, compared with untreated cells. The Vmax of the L-system in phorbol ester-treated leukemic cells was similar to that of phorbol ester-treated normal B lymphocytes. The L-system enhancement of the leukemic cells paralleled the development of plasmacytoid features at 40 h. Uptake of leucine, a naturally occurring L-system amino acid, was also increased by tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate. Cycloheximide, 100 micrograms/ml, which inhibited over 90% of protein synthesis in phorbol ester-treated chronic leukemic cells, blocked completely the phorbol ester-induced L-system enhancement. Phorbol ester treatment restores the selective L-system transport defect in chronic lymphocytic leukemia B lymphocytes, and this process coincides with in vitro maturation of the leukemic cells.\r"

Characteristics of this response include an enhanced release of bone marrow neutrophils, activation of circulating and tissue-phase phagocytes, and enhanced production of neutrophils and monocytes. We have sought to understand the hematopoietic response to acute and chronic inflammatory states on a cellular and molecular level. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are glycoproteins involved in the production and activation of neutrophils and monocytes in vitro and in vivo. We have found that quiescent dermal fibroblasts constitutively release granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), and macrophage CSF in culture, and that picomolar concentrations of the inflammatory mediator IL-1 stimulate by at least fivefold the transcription and release of GM-CSF and G-CSF. These findings establish the role of IL-1 in the hematopoietic response to inflammation through the stimulation of the production and release of GM-CSF and G-CSF.\r"

Double negative cells were obtained by twice killing thymocytes with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 antibodies. The resultant population lacked CD4, CD8, and Ig on cell surfaces; it contained cells bearing Ly-24 (27%), Ly-6C (6%), and Ly-5 (B220) detected by 6B2 (6%). These markers are the same as those characteristic of lpr/lpr T cells; they also are found on bone marrow cells. In order to investigate the maturational pathway of CD4-, CD8- thymocytes, such cells were cultured in vitro for 6 days with phorbol myristate acetate + calcium ionophore. There was a marked increase in cells bearing Ly-24 with time; by 6 days essentially all bore Ly-24. A lesser increase (to 15%) in 6B2 + Thy-1 positive cells was observed. Small numbers of cells bearing CD4 and/or CD8 also were found after 6 days in vitro. In additional studies, CD4-, CD8- cells were first sorted with respect to Ly-24 and then cultured with phorbol myristate acetate + calcium ionophore. Ly-24+ cells proliferated vigorously and formed clusters whereas Ly-24- cells did not. The former gave rise to large numbers of CD4+, CD8+ cells; the latter exhibited little differentiation. These studies demonstrate substantial heterogeneity within the CD4-, CD8- thymocyte population. Use of the markers Ly-24, Ly6C, and 6B2 allows a subdivision of such progenitor thymocytes. Different stages of maturation as well as possible lineages of cells may be investigated by combining such hemopoietic cell surface markers with in vitro culture.\r"

B8.7 antigen is also present on two out of eight B cell lines tested and is characterized as a membrane component displaying an approximate molecular weight of 55,000 to 60,000. By contrast, B8.7 is absent from resting B cells, monocytes, resting or activated T cells, and from the eight non-B cell lines tested. After in vitro activation, B8.7 antigen appears later than the transferrin receptor and its expression increases until day 3. The anti-B8.7 monoclonal antibody induces a dose-related inhibition of the low molecular weight B cell growth factor-dependent proliferation of activated B cells, whereas it does not affect their response to interleukin 2. This strongly suggests that the B8.7 epitope is present on a molecule selectively involved in the interaction between B cells and a B cell growth factor.\r"

Among several T cell-dependent and independent B cell stimulation systems tested (anti-mu, pokeweed mitogen, Epstein-Barr virus), only the activation by Epstein-Barr virus was inhibited by rTNF-alpha. rTNF-alpha inhibited in a dose-dependent manner both the proliferation and differentiation (Ig secretion) of Epstein-Barr virus-stimulated B cells when added at the beginning or within 48 hr of a 6 to 8-day culture period. Maximal suppression (80 to 95%) was found at rTNF-alpha concentrations of 10 to 50 ng/ml. Inhibition of B cell activation required the presence of significant numbers (25%) of plastic adherent macrophages within the B cell population. Suppression was not due to lysis of Epstein-Barr virus-infected B cells by rTNF-alpha-treated macrophages. As shown by double chamber experiments where macrophages and B cells were separated by a 0.45-micron membrane, macrophages elaborated factors in response to rTNF-alpha, which, alone or synergistically with rTNF-alpha, inhibited B cell activation. These factors were different from prostaglandin E2, interferon-alpha, and interleukin 1. We conclude that rTNF-alpha can dramatically modulate certain normal immune responses in vitro.\r"

These antibodies were produced in rats immunized with preparations of purified, recombinant mouse IL-3, obtained from transiently transfected COS7 cell supernatant. Hybridomas secreting anti-IL-3 were selected initially either on the basis of their giving a positive signal in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or for their ability to inhibit the proliferation of the IL-3-dependent mouse mast cell line, MC/9. Neutralizing rat monoclonal IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies have been identified; these also block IL-3-induced proliferation of the NFS-60 and IC2 cell lines. These antibodies also blocked the IL-3-induced proliferation of mouse bone marrow-derived colony-forming units-culture suggesting that the same epitopes on IL-3 influence receptor recognition for both the proliferation of factor-dependent cell lines as well as normal bone marrow cells. Fab fragments produced from certain of the IgG2a-neutralizing antibodies blocked as well as the parent IgG. Antibody cross-blocking studies identified one neutralizing antibody apparently recognizing an epitope that was spatially distinct from those recognized by the other blocking antibodies tested. The development of these neutralizing rat monoclonal antibodies to mouse IL-3 should facilitate further investigation on the role of this factor in hemopoietic regulation.\r"

  ".W": "The effect of ligand interactions with the C3d/C3dg complement receptor (CR2) on proliferation of human B lymphoblastoid cells was investigated by using cell cultures performed at low density (1 to 1.5 x 10(3) cells/ml) in a serum-free defined medium to which only transferrin had been added. This medium does not allow proliferation of Raji cells which die within 48 hr with formation of polykaryons. Addition of purified human C3 to the cultures resulted in a dose-dependent proliferation of the cells. A steady growth of Raji cells with a doubling time of 36 hr was observed in cultures containing 10 micrograms/ml of C3. A growth rate similar to that observed in the presence of native C3 was found in the presence of equimolar concentrations of purified C3dg but not of C3c. F(ab')2 anti-C3d but not F(ab')2 anti-C3c antibodies inhibited the mitogenic effect of C3. Preincubation of Raji cells with monoclonal antibody OKB7 which directly inhibits the binding of C3dg to CR2, totally suppressed C3-induced growth of the cells. C3 did not enhance growth of the T lymphoma-derived cell line JM and monocytic cell line U937 which do not express CR2. These results provide direct evidence that the interaction between CR2 and C3 fragments stimulates proliferation of human cells of the B lineage. Because CR2 also acts as a receptor for Epstein-Barr virus on B cells, our results may pertain to the B cell mitogenic properties of the virus.\r"

Cross-linking of SIg by bivalent antibody converts it into a detergent insoluble state. The resultant SIg may be partially solubilized by incubating the detergent insoluble cytoskeleton in buffers that convert F actin to G actin. Immunoprecipitation of SIg from the detergent soluble fraction of [35S]methionine-labeled B cells results in the co-isolation of 112 kDa, 42 kDa, (actin), and three additional proteins in the 70- to 73-kDa molecular mass range, isoelectric point 4.8 to 5.6. Analysis of anti-Ig immunoprecipitates made after preclearing with anti-alpha-actinin showed complete depletion of the 112-kDa protein, suggesting that the 112-kDa protein is immunologically related to alpha-actinin. These immunoprecipitates also showed partial depletion of 70- to 73-kDa proteins and mu and delta heavy chains. After treatment of a rat B cells with anti-Ig, much of the Ig-associated 112-kDa protein and 70- to 73-kDa proteins became detergent insoluble, concomitant with most of the SIg. The migration of the SIg-associated 112-kDa and 70- to 73-kDa proteins from the detergent soluble fraction to the detergent insoluble fraction after ligand treatment, suggests that these proteins might be involved in linking SIg to the underlying cytoskeleton and could be involved in the transmission of mitogenic signals.\r"

Herein we present a detailed analysis of the biosynthesis and structure of CD22 and also compare it directly to CD21. Electrophoresis under reducing and nonreducing conditions suggested that CD22 and CD21 may have similarities in intra-chain disulfide bond formation. Biosynthesis and processing of CD22 and CD21 were very similar with respect to kinetics and post-translational modification, and both could be phosphorylated. However, endoglycosidase digestion (using N-glycanase and endoglycosidase H) and peptide mapping (using V8 protease and N-chlorosuccinimide) strongly suggested that CD22 and CD21 are distinct gene products.\r"

In contrast to the cytoplasmic alkalinization induced by 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an acidification was recorded in cells treated with phytohemagglutinin. This decrease in pHi was magnified in Na+-free medium or in the presence of amiloride analogues, suggesting that activation of Na+/H+ exchange partially counteracts the phytohemagglutinin-induced acidification. The decrease in pHi was dependent on a sustained increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ and could be mimicked by addition of the divalent cation ionophore, ionomycin. The elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+ leads to metabolic H+ (equivalent) generation with consequent cytoplasmic acidification, which in human T cells predominates over the concurrent activation of the Na+/H+ antiport. These findings argue against the notion that activation of Na+/H+ exchange is a signal for the initiation of proliferation.\r"

When mice are injected with SRBC 10 to 15 days after initial chlamydia infection, the specific anti-SRBC plaque-forming cell response is suppressed two- to three-fold. In vitro, low numbers (2 to 5 X 10(6) bacteria/ml) of chlamydia stimulate potent proliferative responses by B lymphocytes while high numbers (25 X 10(6) bacteria/ml) of bacteria generate strong, general T suppressor activity. This model has important implications for regulation of immune responses that arise at different times during chlamydial infections, as well as for the potential effectiveness of chlamydial vaccines.\r"

Animals that received the vaccine accompanied by rIL-2 had an incidence of infection, assessed by detection of clinical lesions and/or viral shedding, that varied between 0 and 43% significantly lower than the incidence of 63 to 100% in guinea pigs submitted to the same immunization schedule without rIL-2. Animals that escaped acute infection failed to develop recurrent disease. In addition, severity of acute infection was decreased by rIL-2 co-administration as well as by increasing the number of vaccine doses. We also studied the immune response of the guinea pigs to vaccination and the mechanism of protection. Both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers of antibodies to HSV type 2 and specific antigen stimulation of lymphocytes measured by proliferation and interferon production did not significantly differ among the immunization groups. However, specific cellular cytotoxicity was enhanced by rIL-2 co-administration and was positively correlated with protection. This suggests that rIL-2 may become an important adjuvant in active immunization programs using subunit vaccines, particularly against diseases in which cellular cytotoxicity is a major defense mechanism.\r"

  ".W": "Class II-specific allogeneic cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) consist of two types of cells, i.e., Lyt-2+L3T4- and Lyt-2-L3T4 T cells. The Lyt-2+L3T4- class II-specific CTL population constitutes a conspicuous exception to the general correlation observed between the class of major histocompatibility complex antigen recognized and the type of accessory molecules expressed by T cells. In order to examine the specificity of such an exceptional T cell population, CTL clones were established by limiting dilution of a bulk CTL line developed in an I region incompatible combination of mouse strains, B10.QBR anti-B10.MBR. These CTL lines showed single genetic specificity indicating their clonal nature with respect to CTL activities. Lyt-2+L3T4- (2+4-), Lyt-2-L3T4+ (2-4+) and Lyt-2-L3T4- (2-4-) clones were obtained. Among many CTL clones showing a spectrum of genetic specificities, 2+4- and 2-4+ clones with apparent I-Ak-specificity, were studied further and four lines of evidence confirmed their class II specificity: 1) genes encoding the target antigen for these CTL clones were mapped within the I-A subregion by simple genetics; 2) an I-Ak-specific monoclonal antibody readily blocked specific cytolysis by these clones; 3) the clones failed to react with cells expressing mutated I-Ak antigens; and 4) a B cell tumor transfected with alpha- and beta-chain genes of I-Ak was specifically lysed by these CTL clones. These data therefore establish the existence of Lyt-2+ CTL with genuine class II specificity. All 2-4+ CTL were sensitive to the blocking effect of an antibody to L3T4, whereas none of the 2+4- class II-specific CTL were sensitive to blocking by an anti-Lyt-2 antibody, indicating that class II-specific CTL with \"wrong phenotype\" is not dependent on the function of the accessory molecule. Besides true class II-specific CTL clones, 2+4- clones with a spectrum of genetic specificities were obtained, including clones recognizing a combination of an I-Ak product and the Kb molecule. Two 2-4- clones were also specific for the combination of Kb + I-Ak. These clones most likely recognize an allogeneic class II antigen in the context of a class I antigen and therefore would more appropriately be included in the class I-restricted T cell population.\r"

In this study, the effect of cellular activation on the growth of transformed T cells, of known or unknown antigen specificity, was explored with stimulatory monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that recognize nonclonally distributed T cell surface molecules. Anti-CD3 antibodies stimulated interleukin 2 (IL-2) secretion while they inhibited murine and human T cell tumor growth in vitro. Both responses required external cross-linking of the anti-CD3 antibodies. Activation via two molecules that are not physically associated with the T cell antigen receptor, Thy-1 and Ly-6, also inhibited transformed T cell growth while inducing IL-2 secretion. Notably, an anti-Thy-1 mAb that did not cause the transformed T cells to secrete lymphokines failed to affect their growth, and in fact blocked the growth inhibition induced by the stimulatory mAb. Regardless of which stimulating mAb was used, IL-2 production and cell growth were inversely proportional, manifesting similar antibody dose-response curves. Activation of a T cell hybridoma with stimulatory mAb resulted in rapid lysis, as evidenced by the release of 51Cr and lactate dehydrogenase. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that cellular activation was accompanied by a cell cycle block between the G1 and S phases, and probably a slowing of the transit of cells already in S. These results demonstrate that the growth of a spectrum of neoplastic T cells, murine and human, can be inhibited by what are normally growth-promoting signals for non-transformed T cells.\r"

We studied the binding of five of the anti-Id to the anti-AChR monoclonal antibodies bearing the complementary idiotopes (Id-mAb). They bound with Kd values ranging from 0.06 to 0.86 nM, values comparable to those of Id-mAb:AChR complexes (0.26 and 0.34 nM). All of the anti-Id tested moderately inhibited the binding of AChR to Id-mAb, whereas for each anti-Id, AChR either strongly inhibited anti-Id binding or had no effect on anti-Id binding. Hence, the inhibition of Id-mAb:AChR binding by anti-Id was not reciprocal with the inhibition of anti-Id:Id-mAb binding by AChR. For each anti-Id, the relative affinities of anti-Id and AChR for Id-mAb together with the lack of symmetry of inhibition by anti-Id compared to inhibition by AChR indicate that these two \"ligands\" are not competitive inhibitors. Consequently, anti-Id and AChR do not bind to overlapping sites on the Id-mAb, suggesting that the observed inhibition is mediated allosterically. This may be a common mechanism of anti-Id:Id binding, which would have important implications for the mechanism of anti-Id-induced suppression.\r"

To clarify the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of collagen-induced arthritis, we inoculated this cell line into DBA/1J mice and found that they developed clinical arthritis, albeit at a low incidence. The cells attenuated by x-ray were capable of inducing resistance to the subsequent induction of collagen-induced arthritis of DBA/1J mice. The sera from mice protected by inoculation of the cell line exhibited anti-idiotypic antibody response against conventional and monoclonal anti-CII antibodies.

We found that the human cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone TBI-6, which is specific for the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed cell line, CM-EBV, could be directed to lyse the Fc receptor-positive murine tumor P388D1, by the combination of anti-T11(2) plus anti-T11(3) Ab. This activation and lysis was demonstrable only with an Fc receptor expressing tumor target and only with those Ab or with anti-T3 (CD3) Ab but not with other anti-T11 Ab or other Ab directed against surface structures on the clone. We therefore constructed heterodimeric Ab consisting of anti-T11(2) or anti-T11(3) Ab and the J5 anti-common acute lymphoblastic leukemic antigen (anti-CALLA) Ab. The purity and retained functional properties of the dimers were demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis on relevant cells, and by the ability of these conjugates to activate human peripheral blood lymphocytes to proliferate. These heterodimeric Ab conjugates were shown to be able to direct the lysis of CALLA+ targets by TBI-6. The specificity of this lysis was demonstrated by the inability of these heterodimers to direct the lysis of CALLA- targets by the cytotoxic T lymphocyte clone, and by the ability of excess free J5, but not an irrelevant Ab of the same isotype, to block this type of lysis. The potential clinical significance of these reagents is discussed.\r"

Stimulation of multipotential stem cells by IL-3 appears to develop committed erythroid progenitor cells that respond to EPO. When several murine IL-3-dependent cell lines were assayed for their ability to respond to EPO, the growth and survival of the three cell lines showing the profiles of either myeloid or mast cell lineage (IC-2, DA-1, FDC-P2) were stimulated by EPO in a dose-dependent fashion. To determine whether the biologic effects were mediated through the specific receptors for EPO, we performed binding experiments on these cells with radioiodinated EPO. All of these cells displayed significant levels of specific binding for EPO. Among a family of hemopoietic growth factors, only unlabeled EPO was able to compete for the binding of radioiodinated EPO to the cells. Analysis of the binding data revealed the existence of a single case of binding sites in extremely low abundance. IC-2 cells were used to study the effects of IL-3 on the regulation of expression of EPO receptors. It was demonstrated that a decrease in IL-3 concentration in the culture medium increased the responsiveness to EPO and the amount in specific binding of EPO as well. These results suggest that some IL-3-dependent cell lines have functional EPO receptors and their expression may be modulated by IL-3.\r"

In primary suspension cultures of marrow cells taken from eosinophilic mice, IL-3 induced a modest stimulation of eosinophil production compared to IL-5. In contrast, IL-3 was sevenfold more effective than IL-5 in generating eosinophil progenitors (eosinophil colony-forming units (CFU-eo] from more primitive precursors present in the marrow of normal mice. Pre-incubation of marrow cells in suspension culture with IL-3, but not IL-5, increased the recovery of myeloid precursors responsive to G-CSF, GM-CSF, CSF-1, or IL-3 two- to fourfold while eosinophil progenitor cells responsive to IL-5 were increased by more than 70-fold. Similarly, pre-incubation of bone marrow cells under clonal conditions with IL-3, but not IL-5, resulted in a more than 50 fold increase in CFU-eo responsive to IL-5 over input values. Bone marrow from mice pre-treated with 5-fluorouracil is greatly depleted of progenitor cells directly responsive to IL-3 or IL-5. IL-1 which synergistically interacts with various CSF species to confer a clonogenic response by primitive stem cells present in 5-fluorouracil-treated marrow also failed to stimulate eosinophil production. A marked synergism was observed when IL-1 and IL-3 were combined in the suspension pre-culture phase with a more than sixfold recovery of CFU-eo than induced by either factor alone. Furthermore, pre-culture of 5-fluorouracil-treated marrow cells with a combination of IL-1 and IL-3 resulted in a more than 260-fold increase of CFU-eo over input numbers. These data suggest that the concatenate action of IL-1, IL-3, and IL-5 is an absolute requirement for the in vitro generation of eosinophils from primitive hemopoietic stem cells.\r"

  ".W": "Recent scanning electron microscopic studies on isolated follicular dendritic cells (FDC) showed that dendrites of certain FDC were \"beaded,\" i.e., consisting of a series of interconnected immune complex coated bodies (termed \"iccosomes,\" measuring 0.3 to 0.7 micron diameter). In vitro these iccosomes detach from one another with ease. The major objectives herein were to establish whether these structures can be detected in sections and whether iccosomes serve to disseminate antigen in vivo. Beginning at day 1, the time point used for isolating beaded FDC, the popliteal lymph nodes of immune C3H mice were studied with light and transmission electron microscopy for 2 wk (i.e., at days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14) after hind footpad injection of the histochemically detectable antigen, horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Iccosomes (0.25 to 0.38 micron diameter), contoured by a peroxidase (PO)-positive coat of HRP-anti-HRP complexes, were first detected by transmission electron microscopy at day 1 adjacent to cell bodies of certain FDC. Within their limiting membrane they contained flocculent material that was PO positive. At day 3 by light microscopy, germinal centers were seen enlarged and the antigen-retaining reticulum, composed of antigen-bearing FDC, appeared diffuse. This coincided with the transmission electron microscopic visualization of a dispersed state of iccosomes among the follicular lymphocytes. At that time iccosomes were seen attached to the surface of lymphocytes via PO-positive immune complexes and were surrounded by microvillous processes of these cells. Germinal center lymphocytes and tingible body macrophages both responded to contact with iccosomes by endocytosis. Antigen-containing tingible body macrophage were most conspicuous by light microscopy at day 5, when transmission electron microscopy showed that the majority of germinal center lymphocytes contained endocytosed HRP in secondary lysosome-like granules associated with the Golgi apparatus. The number of dispersed iccosomes was markedly reduced by day 5. In controls injected with HSA, a PO-negative antigen, lymphocytes and tingible body macrophages were PO-negative. The presence of antigen in both cell types was confirmed through the use of a gold-conjugated antigen (goat IgG). Simultaneous immunoperoxidase labeling of the same tissues with anti-Ia showed the gold conjugate containing B cells to be Ia+. Antigen-positive B cells and tingible body macrophages were greatly reduced in numbers by day 14, suggesting the intracellular fragmentation of the antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\r"

  ".W": "Shortly after secondary immunization germinal center (GC) B cells obtain antigen from follicular dendritic cells (FDC) in the form of immune complexes. This antigen appears to be degraded by the GC B cells and may be processed for presentation to T cells. The present study was undertaken to determine whether GC B cells can process and present antigen obtained from FDC in vivo to appropriate T cells in vitro. GC B cells were isolated from immune mice with the use of Percoll density separation followed by a panning procedure which utilizes the ability of the plant lectin, peanut agglutinin (PNA), to selectively bind to GC B cells. The enriched GC B cells were approximately 80% highly positive for PNA, 97% positive for Ia and surface IgM, but less than 0.01% positive for Thy-1.2 or esterase. In some experiments, this population was further purified to near 100% highly PNA-positive cells with the use of fluoresceinated PNA and a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cell sorting analysis indicated that the antigen (125I-labeled ovalbumin (OVA)) was restricted to the highly PNA-positive cell fraction. The capacity of these highly PNA-positive B cells to present antigen was assessed by monitoring interleukin 2 (IL-2) production by the OVA-specific T cell hybridoma, 3DO-54.8. GC B cells obtained from mice 3 wk or more after secondary immunization did not elicit IL-2 production in the absence of added OVA. However, GC B cells isolated as early as 1 day and for over 1 wk after a challenge with OVA, were able to stimulate high levels of IL-2 production, in the absence of adding OVA to the cell cultures. This response was maximal on day 5 and corresponded precisely with the kinetics of the ultrastructural studies which document the uptake of antigen by GC B cells in vivo. The FDC-derived antigen was remarkably immunogenic when compared with exogenous antigen. These findings demonstrated that antigen obtained in vivo by GC B cells could be processed and presented to T cells. In vivo, GC B cells may induce the T cell help needed for the germinal center reaction, generate B memory cells, and help induce the high titers of antibody associated with the secondary antibody response.\r"

Activation of protein kinase C by the phorbol ester, tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate or other phorbol esters increases the levels of the alpha and beta T cell receptor (TcR-alpha, TcR-beta) mRNA, whereas an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, induced by ionomycin or other Ca2+ ionophores, results in a decrease of alpha and beta TcR mRNA levels. In contrast, ionomycin increases the expression TcR-gamma mRNA whereas tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate prevents this induction. Our results suggest the existence of two opposing intracellular pathways that control expression of TcR-alpha and TcR-beta mRNA levels, on the one hand and TcR-gamma mRNA, on the other. These results provide the first evidence for antagonistic actions of protein kinase C and cytosolic-free Ca2+ on gene expression.\r"

  ".W": "The functional effects resulting from CD4 and CD8 perturbation were analyzed by using a CD4+CD8+ clone and anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 monoclonal antibodies. Perturbation of CD8, but not CD4, by soluble antibody resulted in the inhibition of CD3-T cell receptor (CD3-Ti) triggering as determined by flow cytometric measurements of intracellular free Ca2+ concentrations. In addition, the CD3-T cell receptor-mediated cytotoxic function of the CD4+CD8+ clone was inhibited by anti-CD8, but not by anti-CD4. These results suggest that CD8, but not CD4, was functionally associated with CD3-Ti on the CD4+CD8+ clone. Although CD4 perturbation did not affect CD3-Ti-mediated activities, it resulted in the inhibition of the interleukin 2-dependent proliferation of this clone. Perturbation of CD8 did not affect the interleukin 2 dependent proliferation of the CD4+CD8+ clone. On the other hand, CD4 molecules of another CD4+CD8- clone unlike those of the CD4+CD8+ clone, were clearly linked to T cell receptor function. These results indicate that CD4 perturbation can result in two distinct regulatory activities; one involves the regulation of CD3-T cell receptor function, whereas the other is not directly associated with CD3-T cell antigen receptor function. The data are also consistent with the notion that CD4 and CD8 do not merely function as recognition and adhesion elements for accessory cell major histocompatibility complex molecules, but have a direct role in the regulation of T cell activation.\r"

  ".U": "88088846\r", 
  ".W": "In this study we have evaluated some of the potential mechanisms that may be responsible for the inefficiency with which resting B cells function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) and the mechanism by which that function is enhanced following treatment of B cells with neuraminidase. One mechanism that has been previously suggested is that glycosylation differences in Ia associated with different APC accounts for the different functional capacities of resting and activated B cells. It has been postulated that removal of sialic acid from resting B cell Ia results in a correction of its antigen-presenting defect. To study this possibility, we have used purified I-Ad from different B cell sources in a planar membrane system to present an immunogenic peptide of chicken ovalbumin (Ova) to an I-Ad-restricted Ova-specific T cell hybridoma. It was found that I-Ad isolated from resting B cells, B cell stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) or lipopolysaccharide and dextran sulfate-stimulated B cells, or A20 B lymphoma cells were all equivalent in their antigen-presenting capacity. Furthermore, removal of sialic acid from Ia did not enhance its capacity to serve as a restriction element. The mechanism by which neuraminidase treatment enhances B cell APC function was further investigated by studying the effect of sialic acid removal on a primary mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR). When allogeneic fixed B cells were used as stimulator cells it was found that neither resting nor BSF-1-stimulated B cells could induce a MLR. Following neuraminidase treatment, BSF-1-treated B cells, but not resting B cells, were capable of stimulating a MLR. However, a MLR was also stimulated by allogeneic BSF-1-treated B cells when the responder T cells, rather than the stimulator cells, were treated with neuraminidase. An enhancing effect similar to that obtained by neuraminidase treatment could be obtained by the addition of 2% polyethylene glycol to the MLR culture. These data suggest that the inability of BSF-1-stimulated cells to function efficiently as accessory cells in stimulating a primary MLR is due to their relative inability to interact physically with T cells, a deficiency that is overcome by neuraminidase treatment of either T or B cell populations or by the addition of polyethylene glycol to the culture. Although the reason for the failure of these same treatments to restore the accessory cell function of resting B cells is not known, some possible mechanisms are discussed.\r"

Immunofluorescence studies indicated that these mAb react with activated, but not with resting T and B lymphocytes or with other types of cells. Immunoprecipitation studies with 125-I-labeled extracts from T and B cell lines demonstrated that the m.w. of the antigen recognized by mAb NDA3 is 36,000 and that of NDA4 is 46,000. Studies on the effect of mAb NDA3 and NDA4 on Epstein Barr Virus-transformed lymphoblastoid B cell lines (LBCL) demonstrated that these antibodies stimulate B cell proliferation and Ig synthesis. The level of expression of NDA3 and NDA4 on the membrane of LBCL is significantly augmented when cells are grown in the presence of recombinant human interferon-beta and gamma and is decreased in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. These observations, in conjunction with the stimulatory effect of mAb NDA3 and NDA4 on the growth and differentiation of LBCL, suggest that these new differentiation antigens, NDA3 and NDA4, may serve as growth factor receptors.\r"

  ".U": "88088848\r", 
  ".W": "Helper T cell recognition of globular protein antigens requires the intracellular processing of the native molecule by an antigen-presenting cell and subsequent presentation of a peptide fragment, containing the antigenic determinant, on the cell surface where it is recognized by the specific T cell in conjunction with Ia. B lymphocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells and, when antigen is bound by their surface Ig, are greatly enhanced in this capacity. In this report it is demonstrated that pigeon cytochrome c covalently coupled to antibodies directed toward either B cell surface immunoglobulin, class I or class II are effectively processed and presented by B cells to cytochrome c-specific T cells, requiring up to 1000-fold less cytochrome c as compared with cytochrome c alone or cytochrome c coupled to nonspecific immunoglobulin. The potent activity of the cytochrome c-antibody conjugates appears to be due to the ability of B cells to concentrate the antigen when the process becomes receptor mediated rather than to a signal provided to the B cell by the conjugate binding, because cytochrome c was not more effectively presented in the presence of unconjugated antibodies as compared with cytochrome c alone. Furthermore, the binding of the native antigen to B cell surfaces is not alone sufficient for T cell activation, in that the cytochrome c-antibody conjugates require processing and are major histocompatibility complex restricted. The results presented here indicate that surface immunoglobulin is not unique in its ability to facilitate antigen processing and/or presentation and that Ig, class I and class II are capable of transporting the cytochrome c to a cytoplasmic vesicle where proteolysis occurs yielding the required peptide, minimally of 10 amino acids. Cytochrome c coupled to monovalent fragments of anti-Ig-antibodies was nearly as effectively presented as cytochrome c coupled to bivalent antibodies, indicating that phenomena mediated by bivalent binding, such as patching and capping of the surface Ig, were not required for effective antigen presentation. The cytochrome c-antibody conjugates, which allow antigen processing to be initiated by receptor-mediated endocytosis, may provide the necessary tools to unravel the intracellular processes by which protein antigens are processed and presented by B lymphocytes.\r"

  ".W": "To elucidate the structure, diversity, and activation properties of the murine T3-associated gamma delta-receptor, examination was made of the gamma delta and T3 components, T cell receptor (TCR) gene transcription, activation properties, and lymphokine production in a panel of four cloned T cell hybridomas expressing a TCR-gamma delta. Biochemical analysis of the gamma and delta proteins expressed on these hybridomas reveals new gamma and delta species not observed in whole populations of dLy-1 Lyt-2-L3T4-thymocytes from which these hybridomas were derived. Thus, analysis of expression of the TCR-gamma delta complex at the clonal level indicates that both gamma and delta appear to be expressed as multiple distinct gene products within a homozygous inbred mouse strain. Northern blot analysis reveals that, whereas all gamma delta hybridomas had mature 1.5-kb TCR-alpha-chain and mature TCR-gamma-chain transcripts, none had mature 1.3-kb TCR-beta-chain transcripts, thus indicating that the type of TCR heterodimer expressed reflects of the state of TCR gene transcription in these hybridomas. Our results also reveal striking similarities between TCR-gamma delta and TCR-alpha beta cells with respect to their activation properties. First, all five of the T3 components associated with the gamma delta-complex are of the same size and have the same glycosylation patterns as those associated with alpha beta-heterodimers. Second, induction of function in these gamma delta cells (assayed by lymphokine production) can be achieved with a variety of stimuli known to elicit activation signals in alpha beta cells as well: direct receptor-engagement (i.e., through anti-Thy-1), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-plus-ionomycin-mediated. Collectively, these findings suggest that gamma delta T cells express a receptor of at least limited diversity and use T3-mediated activation pathways very similar to those employed by TCR-alpha beta-bearing T cells.\r"

  ".W": "A single monoclonal T helper (Th) clone can activate B cells in two distinct pathways; a cognate pathway requiring a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T-B cell interaction, and a noncognate pathway not requiring an MHC-restricted T-B cell interaction. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether Th cells mediating a given immune response provide further regulatory function to B cells other than helper function. It was demonstrated that conditions of high antigen concentration which activate a noncognate B cell activation pathway simultaneously inhibit IgG responses. The inhibition is shown to be mediated by the T cell factor interleukin 4, produced by activated cloned Th cells. The inhibitory effect of this factor is directed to B cells and is MHC-unrestricted, antigen-nonspecific, and IgG class-specific. In addition to being susceptible to the effects of augmenting cells and suppressor cells, cloned Th cell populations can therefore themselves function as regulatory cells to inhibit IgG responses when stimulated with high dose of specific antigen. These results indicate that Th cells function to regulate B cells both positively and negatively, depending upon the activation conditions.\r"

Both bryostatins 1 and 2 were able to trigger cytotoxicity of CTL clones against antigen-nonbearing target cells and inhibited CTL cytotoxicity against Ag-specific target cells. Bryostatin 1 and 2 synergize with Ca2+ ionophores in triggering the exocytosis of cytolytic granules from CTL at very low concentrations.

Both the clinical and histopathologic manifestations of the disease were suppressed in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, proliferative responses to MBP and, to a lesser extent, serum levels of anti-MBP antibody were suppressed by feeding MBP. Suppression of clinical and histologic disease was observed whether animals were fed MBP before or after disease induction, although suppression was more complete when rats were fed before immunization. Disease was also suppressed by the oral administration of either encephalitogenic or nonencephalitogenic fragments and decapeptides of the MBP molecule, with more complete suppression observed when nonencephalitogenic fragments were fed, suggesting that suppressor determinants exist in the MBP molecule distinct from the encephalitogenic region. The oral administration of a non-disease-inducing portion of an autoantigen represents an antigen-specific method by which an experimental autoimmune disease can be immunoregulated.\r"

As a marker of these responses, the reactivity to single-stranded DNA of various mammalian and bacterial species origin was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Patients with SLE demonstrated serum antibodies to all six types of DNA tested, whereas normal control subjects showed appreciable antibody responses only to DNA obtained from Micrococcus lysodeikticus (MC) and Staphylococcus epidermidus (SE). Anti-DNA antibodies in normal sera appeared to recognize unique sites on the DNA because MC DNA failed to inhibit antibody binding to SE DNA, and vice versa; in contrast, SLE antibody binding to MC DNA could be inhibited by SE as well as other DNA, suggesting recognition of a more widely shared epitope. The expression in normal sera of antibodies specific for certain bacterial DNA is consistent with their induction by structural determinants on these DNA molecules that are immunogenic. DNA may therefore represent another bacterial macromolecule capable of inducing cross-reactive antibodies in human autoimmune disease.\r"

By using Scatchard plot analysis of equilibrium binding data, it is demonstrated that 125I-IL-4 binds to a high affinity cell surface receptor which is expressed by both hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells. The dissociation constant for 125I-IL-4 (Kd = 20 to 60 pM) corresponds to the concentration of IL-4 which gives 50% biologic activity (i.e., 10 to 30 pM). Binding of 125I-IL-4 is rapid (t1/2 of 2 min), whereas dissociation occurs at a slow rate (t1/2 approximately 4 hr). The IL-4 receptor shows a high degree of specificity. Whereas unlabeled mouse IL-4 competed with mouse 125I-IL-4 in an equimolar fashion for binding to IL-4 receptors, several other lymphokines, including mouse IL-2, IL-3, interferon-gamma, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and human IL-1, IL-2, and IL-4 were unable to inhibit, even at molar excesses of 400 to 800-fold. At 37 degrees C, 125I-IL-4 is rapidly internalized (approximately 200 molecules/cell/min) by HT-2 cells, with at least 85% of cell surface receptors being functional in this respect. Receptors for IL-4 were found to be expressed by subclasses of T and B cells, mast cells, macrophages, and by cells of the myeloid and erythroid lineages. This wide distribution of receptor expression closely matches the known spectrum of biologic activities of IL-4, including proliferation and/or differentiation of T and B cells, mast cells and granulocytes, and induction of macrophage antigen-presenting capacity. IL-4 receptors were also found on a variety of nonhemopoietic cells such as cloned stromal cell lines from the bone marrow, spleen, thymus, and brain, and on muscle, brain, melanoma, fibroblast, and liver cells. Indeed, only 5 of more than 90 cell types tested have undetectable numbers of IL-4 receptors. The biologic effects of IL-4 on nonhemopoietic cells have not yet been reported and await elucidation.\r"

When SAC-activated B cells were separated into Tac-antigen (Tac-Ag)+ and Tac-Ag- fractions by a cell sorter, recombinant IL-2 induced only the Tac-Ag+ cells to proliferate, whereas both Tac-Ag+ and Tac-Ag- cells responded to HMW-BCGF (m.w. 60,000). Alternatively, SAC-activated B cells were separated according to density into three fractions: low density (large) cells (82 +/- 15% Tac-Ag+), intermediate density (medium) cells (45 +/- 13% Tac-Ag+), and high density (small) cells (less than 5% Tac-Ag+). Recombinant IL-2 enhanced proliferation of low density cells the most, intermediate density cells less, and high density cells not at all. HMW-BCGF induced all three fractions to proliferate to approximately the same degree. Finally, the effects of IL-2 and BCGF on the DNA and RNA content of the various fractions of B cells was examined. RNA content was greater in IL-2-stimulated B cells than BCGF-stimulated B cells, whereas DNA content was the same in both cell populations. IL-2 and BCGF may preferentially interact with different subpopulations of B cells. The interaction of IL-2 or BCGF with normal activated B cells may induce both similar and different intracellular events.\r"

It was found that these thymocytes proliferated extensively when cultured in the presence of IL-4 + phorbol myristate acetate without apparent differentiation to Lyt-2+ or L3T4+ cells. We also demonstrated that 2-4- thymocytes constitutively express a high affinity (dissociation constant of 20 to 40 pM) receptor for IL-4. Freshly isolated 2-4- thymocytes expressed on average about 100 IL-4 receptors per cell, but the number of receptors increased approximately 8-fold within 3 days after activation by IL-4 + phorbol myristate acetate. These findings suggest that IL-4 may play an important role in T cell ontogeny by promoting self-renewal of stem cells within the thymus.\r"

FD.C/1 32Dcl-23 and GM cells grown and maintained as IL-3-dependent cell lines, and cells grown with GM-CSF have been infected with a murine recombinant retrovirus containing the v-src oncogene, and grown as lymphokine-independent cell lines. There is a significant increase in tyrosine kinase activity in cells which become lymphokine-independent. FD.C/1 and 32Dcl-23 cells maintained as IL-2-dependent cells lines and infected with the same virus did not grow as IL-2-independent cells. The lymphokine-independent cells FD.C/1src, 32Dsrc, and GMsrc all expressed high levels of tyrosine kinase activity, ranging from 5- to 20-fold more than levels measured in virus-infected cell lines maintained as IL-2-dependent cells. The exposure of FD.C/1src and 32Dsrc cells to IL-3, and GMsrc cells to IL-3 or GM-CSF, resulted in significant decreases in tyrosine kinase activity. These changes were rapidly reversed by removal of IL-3 or GM-CSF from these cells. However, the synthesis of v-src-specific RNA was not affected by the presence of IL-3 or GM-CSF in these cell lines. The biochemical pathways activated by IL-3 or GM-CSF inhibit the activity of the tyrosine kinase encoded by the v-src oncogene without altering gene transcription.\r"

Previous work from our laboratory has indicated that three lymphokines are required for the induction of CTL from murine thymocytes; interleukin 2, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and a partially characterized factor referred to as cytotoxic differentiation factor (CDF). While attempting to clone CDF from the human T cell line C10-MJ2, we found that a gene encoding CDF-like activity is identical to the gene encoding the factor known variously as B cell stimulatory factor-2 (BSF-2), IFN-beta 2, and 26-kDa protein. We report here that BSF-2 can induce the differentiation of Ly-2+ CTL from murine thymocytes in the presence of interleukin 2 and that the level of cytotoxicity is augmented by the addition of murine IFN-gamma. Serine esterase, a marker for cytotoxic granules in CTL, was induced only in the presence of BSF-2, and the level of serine esterase activity correlated with the level of serine esterase activity correlated with the level of cytotoxicity. These data suggest that BSF-2 is a differentiation factor for CTL and that it functions in part by inducing proteins required for mediating target cell lysis.\r"

MRL/lpr sera supported the growth of the IL-3-dependent cell lines FDC-P2 and DA-1 but not the growth of IL-2-dependent T-572 cells. This IL-3-like activity increased with age. Biochemical analysis of the MRL/lpr sera by anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration on a Superose 12 column, the binding to protein-A and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the serum factor with the IL-3-like activity was not IL-3 itself but was associated with IgG. Flow cytometric analysis also showed that the serum level of the Ig capable of binding FDC-P2 cells was high in MRL/lpr but not in MRL/+ mice. We suggest that IL-3 is not responsible for lymphoid hyperplasia, contrary to a previous report; rather auto-antibodies directed toward the IL-3 receptor may act pathogenically in MRL/lpr mice.\r"

Five of the monoclonal antibodies thus obtained bound selectively to IL-3-dependent cells and supported their growth. These monoclonal antibodies inhibited the binding of IL-3 to FDC-P2 cells and vice versa. Thus, these antibodies were probably directed to IL-3 receptor sites, or at least to some cell surface proteins related to the growth of the IL-3-dependent cells. These MRL/lpr-derived monoclonal antibodies reacted strongly with cells from bone marrow, spleen, and lymph node of MRL/lpr mice, but minimally with such cells of MRL/+ or BALB/c mice. The findings were consistent with our earlier suggestion that the IL-3-like activity in MRL/lpr sera is not caused by IL-3 itself but is associated with IgG that is probably an autoantibody directed to the IL-3 receptor.\r"

Highly purified AC-depleted peripheral blood T4 or T8 cells were stimulated with immobilized monoclonal antibodies to the cluster of differentiation (CD)3 molecular complex, an AC-independent stimulus. rTNF alpha augmented anti-CD3-stimulated T4 and T8 cell proliferation. The capacity of rTNF alpha to enhance T cell proliferation varied inversely with the density of immobilized anti-CD3 and the number of responding cells in each culture. The capacity of rTNF alpha to enhance antigen-induced T4 cell proliferation was also examined. Antigen-bearing paraformaldehyde-fixed antigen-presenting cells induced modest T4 cell proliferation when cultured in flat-bottomed wells; this response was enhanced by rTNF alpha. The results demonstrate that rTNF alpha has direct effects on T cells, facilitating their capacity to proliferate in response to mitogens and antigens. These data indicate that rTNF alpha may play an immunoregulatory role, enhancing the proliferation of T lymphocytes.\r"

The murine interleukin 2-dependent CTLL-1 (anti-Iad) clone was used to determine the phase of the cytolytic pathway inhibited by OSS-TMP. Pretreatment of the CTL or target cell with OSS-TMP was not effective at blocking lysis; however, inhibition of lysis was achieved if the reaction was carried out in the continuous presence of OSS-TMP (IC50 = 55 microM) or when CTL-target conjugates were performed and incubated with OSS-TMP (IC50 = 640 microM). Two structural analogues of OSS-TMP were unable to inhibit CTL-mediated lysis. In contrast to OSS-TMP, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethylketone required only a 5-min preincubation with the CTL to inhibit lysis. OSS-TMP did not block recognition-adhesion step(s) of the reaction since the ability to form conjugates was not impaired; however, the lytic efficiency of individual CTL-target pairs were blocked. OSS-TMP did not appear to be an inhibitor of the major granule-associated protease that cleaves the substrate, N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzylester. Ca2+ pulse and kinetic experiments indicated that the OSS-TMP-sensitive site was at a pre-Ca2+-dependent phase but after recognition-adhesion. Human CTL and natural killer cell activity was also inhibited by OSS-TMP, suggesting the presence of a common site of action among these cytolytic systems. The results indicate that OSS-TMP may be a useful reagent in characterizing the early post-recognition events in the cytolytic pathway of CTL and natural killer effector cells.\r"

We show herein that two anti-IgM-stimulated B cell responses can be distinguished by their sensitivity to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAMP inhibits B cell proliferation facilitated by BSF-1 and enhances the B cell response facilitated by IL-1. IL-1 and BSF-1-dependent B cell responses are additive, suggesting that distinct B cell subpopulations are involved. BSF-1-reactive B cells are not inhibited by cAMP in the presence of IL-1. This suggests that IL-1 determines whether cAMP, which has elsewhere been shown to cause nuclear translocation of protein kinase C in resting B cells, inhibits or enhances B cell responses. Comparative studies suggest that the IgM response of spleen cells to red cell-bound antigen involves one of the two pathways described, namely the one that involves IL-1 and cAMP. BSF-1 has no noticeable effect on a Mishell-Dutton plaque-forming cell response. In view of literature on the facilitation by BSF-1 of the IgG response, we consider the possibility that IL-1 functions to stir B cells into an IgM response, whereas BSF-1 acts on B cells that are poised to become IgG producers.\r"

Sensitization is dependent on inactivation of viral neuraminidase activity (which can be achieved by heating virus); and requires fusion of viral and cellular membranes. In the present study, we have examined recognition of antigens derived from heat-treated virus by cloned CTL lines induced by immunization with infectious virus. Target cells sensitized with heat-treated virus were recognized by all 11 CTL clones that were specific for internal virion proteins (nucleoprotein and basic polymerase 1), and by one of six clones specific for the major viral glycoprotein (the hemagglutinin). Immunization of mice with heat-treated virus primed their splenocytes for secondary in vitro CTL responses. CTL generated in this manner recognized target cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing cloned influenza virus gene products. These findings indicate that both integral membrane proteins and internal proteins that comprise virions can be processed by antigen-presenting cells for recognition by class I-restricted CTL. It also appears that not all hemagglutinin determinants recognized on virus-infected cells are presented by cells sensitized with heat-treated virus.\r"

By using the restriction enzyme isoschizomers, MspI and HpaII, we found that T beta of T cells was highly unmethylated, the gene in B cells and monocytes is highly methylated, and the methylation state of T beta of LGL is intermediate between that of T cells and B cells or monocytes. These results indicate that the methylation pattern of T beta can be a marker for T cells and LGL. The difference in methylation pattern of T beta between LGL and T cells indicated that most LGL were different from T cell populations. The methylation pattern of T beta in LGL DNA was also heterogeneous, in contrast to that of other leukocytes, suggesting that human peripheral blood LGL include several cell subsets. Only T cells, which synthesize full length 1.3-kb transcripts of T beta, have almost completely unmethylated CCGG sequences, indicating a good correlation between the reported level of 1.3-kb mRNA transcription from T beta and hypomethylation of this gene.\r"

Keratinocytes were cultured in supplemented MCDB 153 medium in 0.1 mM Ca2+, and plated in 24-well trays. The ability of insulin, placental extract, and epidermal growth factor to enhance growth and thymidine incorporation were compared. Autoradiography was performed to determine the percentage of cells with labeled nuclei. Epidermal growth factor increased thymidine incorporation under the conditions of the assay, and placental extract increased incorporation by up to 50-fold, since the control cells plated in the absence of epidermal growth factor and other growth factors survived but proliferated minimally. Both cell number and thymidine incorporation showed similar concentration dependence upon insulin and placental extract. If placental extract was added to cells plated 28 h earlier, incorporation was maximal after 17 h in the presence of the extract. If cells were plated in the presence of the extract, 85% of nuclei were shown by autoradiography to be labeled after 23 h, but only 24% of nuclei were labeled in the absence of the extract. A plating density of 10(4) cells/2-cm2 well was optimal. The assay permits rapid identification of growth-promoting fractions without prolonged growth periods, and is a valid indicator of these agents in keratinocyte cultures.\r"

  ".W": "The relationship between the turnover of inositol phospholipids (PtdIns) and the growth and differentiation of normal murine keratinocytes in culture was studied. Addition of myo-[U-14C]inositol to freshly plated cells resulted in a linear incorporation of radiolabel into the inositol phospholipids of the proliferating basal cells in culture during the initial 36 h, after which time the rate of radiolabel incorporation into the cells declined. The decrease in the incorporation of the radiolabel into the PtdIns, particularly the more highly phosphorylated PtdIns-4P and PtdIns4,5P2, correlated with the marked hydrolysis of these polyphosphoinositides and the rapid hydrolytic release of the inositol phosphates (InsP2 and InsP3). The transient accumulation of the InsPs correlated with the onset of differentiation of these cells. To ascertain whether the above observations of keratinocytes that were undergoing normal proliferative and differentiating phases in culture are consistent with the more synchronized populations of proliferative and differentiating cells, we investigated the turnover of PtdIns in a Ca2+-regulated system of homogenous populations of proliferating mouse keratinocytes in 0.09 mM Ca2+, and a differentiating population in 1.8 mM Ca2+. Our data from system revealed rapid hydrolysis of the PtdIns in the prelabeled low-Ca2+ proliferating cells immediately after a switch from the low to normal extracellular Ca2+ medium. Associated with this hydrolysis was the rapid and transient accumulation of the InsPs (maximum of 60 sec). The hydrolysis of the PtdIns and the accumulation of the InsP3 were not observed when the prelabeled proliferating cells were switched from a low to a low extracellular Ca2+ medium. These results suggest that the rapid hydrolysis of the PtdIns, particularly PtdIns4,5P2, which was accompanied by the hydrolytic release of InsP3, could be the initiating signal to program proliferating keratinocytes into differentiation.\r"

  ".W": "We investigated the possibility that herpes simplex virus (HSV) glycoproteins might provide potential immunotherapy for recurrent HSV disease by using the guinea pig model of genital HSV infection. In two experiments, after recovery from initial genital herpes, 58 animals were randomized either to receive a glycoprotein vaccine or to serve as controls. Both a mixture of HSV-2 glycoproteins derived from infected tissue cultures and a mixture of HSV-1 glycoproteins B and D, prepared by genetic engineering in mammalian cells, reduced the frequency (P less than .05) and severity (P less than .05) of subsequent herpetic recurrences. We conclude that recurrences of established herpesvirus disease may be altered by administering immunogenic viral proteins; thus, HSV glycoproteins may be useful as immunotherapeutic agents for controlling recurrent HSV infection in humans.\r"

Sixty-five percent of the women had serological evidence of past HSV-2 infection by the Rawls index, based on titers of neutralizing antibody to HSV type 1 and HSV-2. Thirty (88%) of 34 infants exposed to maternal HSV infection at delivery had antibodies to HSV-2 gG and remained well. One infant exposed to primary maternal HSV-2 infection lacked antibodies to HSV-2 gG and developed neonatal HSV-2 infection. The mean +/- SD optical density by HSV-2 gG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for sera obtained from 17 infants within one week after onset of neonatal HSV-2 infection was 0.25 +/- 0.12, compared with 1.15 +/- 0.34 in cord blood sera from exposed infants who did not develop symptoms (P less than .0001 by t test).\r"

The clearance of organisms from blood by C5-deficient and C5-sufficient normal animals was similar. C3 depletion and the inability to fix C3 to the surface of bacteria were, however, associated with impaired clearance of organisms during the first 24 h after intravenous bacterial challenge. These studies suggest that complement-mediated opsonization rather than bacteriolysis is important in determining early clearance of H. influenzae type b from the bloodstream.\r"

Preincubation of LOS with a murine monoclonal antibody to Hib LOS did not reduce the potency of the LOS. Incubation of LOS with polymyxin B (which neutralizes LOS by binding to its lipid A region) and deacylation of the LOS with acyloxyacyl hydrolase (a neutrophil enzyme that removes nonhydroxylated fatty acyl chains from lipid A) reduced meningeal inflammation. We demonstrated that purified Hib LOS induced meningeal inflammation in this model and suggest that the lipid A moiety of Hib LOS is principally responsible for this host response.\r"

The prevalence of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) resistance was 11.5% in isolates from the hospital, whereas 30.0% of episodes of nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae studied in day care children included TMP-SMZ-resistant isolates. The proportion of episodes of colonization with TMP-SMZ-resistant isolates in the day care study increased from 5.4% before 1981 to 39% between 1981 and 1985. Isolates of S. pneumoniae relatively resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/mL) to penicillin G, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime accounted for 8% of isolates from the hospital and 11.9% of episodes of nasopharyngeal colonization in children in day care.

We examined the efficacy of aerosol administration of antiviral agents against murine CMV (MCMV) infection. Animals were inoculated with MCMV intranasally and were treated with oral ganciclovir; with aerosolized ganciclovir, PFA, or ribavirin; or with buffer. MCMV in lung and salivary gland homogenates was quantified by plaque assay. Oral ganciclovir (200 mg/kg per day) reduced titers of MCMV in both tissues by greater than 95%. Aerosolized ganciclovir, 100 and 200 mg/kg per day, reduced lung titers of MCMV by 93% and 97%, respectively. Aerosolized PFA, 20 and 200 mg/kg per day, reduced lung titers of MCMV by 60% and 68%, respectively. Aerosolized ganciclovir and PFA inhibited replication of MCMV in salivary glands substantially less than did oral administration of either agent. Our results suggest that aerosol administration of antiviral agents can potently and selectively inhibit replication of MCMV in the lung.\r"

  ".W": "We report a cohort study of fatal upper GI hemorrhage and/or perforation in relation to use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) among the one million residents of Saskatchewan Canada in 1983. All hospitalized cases of GI hemorrhage and/or perforation with a fatal outcome were identified using the records linkage system of the Saskatchewan Department of Health. Discharge summaries and autopsy records were reviewed to select the cases of upper GI hemorrhage or upper GI perforation and to exclude cases in which known risk factors were present. The 134,060 residents who filled one or more prescriptions for an NSAID in 1983 were identified and individually linked to their hospital records by patient identification number. The age- and gender-specific incidence of fatal upper GI hemorrhage and/or perforation in the absence of risk factors in users was compared to that in nonusers, controlling for recent history of upper GI disease. Fatal upper GI hemorrhage or perforation in temporal association with NSAIDs is extremely rare in persons younger than 75 years of age. No temporally-related cases occurred in male NSAID users age 75 and older, but NSAID usage in this group was limited. Among women age 75 and older, the rate in users was higher than in nonusers, with the highest rate being in female NSAID users age 75 and older with a recent history of upper GI disease. Total mortality among women age 75 and older was slightly lower among users than among nonusers. Physicians who prescribe NSAIDs to patients age 75 and older should be aware of the potential risks, particularly in those with predisposing factors such as a history of upper GI disease.\r"

Five and ten year survival rates for patients never treated with KPAB were 69.8 and 56.6%, respectively. Similar findings were obtained by comparing observed to expected mortality for these patients; again, KPAB therapy showed prolongation of survival. The Cox proportional hazards model was also applied to this retrospective study adjusting for baseline clinical involvement, demographics and KPAB treatment. There were some interesting results including a high significance for skin involvement per se as a prognostic indicator: the greater the extent of skin involvement the poorer prognosis. Time from first diagnosis to first University Hospital visit or admission when included as a covariate did not influence survival.\r"

This regimen was repeated weekly for six doses. Twenty-seven of these patients (87%) were considered to be refractory to prior 5-FU therapy and four (13%) were previously untreated. All 31 patients successfully completed at least one 6-week cycle of this regimen with acceptable toxicity. The combined complete (CR) and partial response (PR) rate was 45% with another 25% of patients remaining stable. The 95% confidence levels for the responding patients are 27.6% and 62.7%, respectively. The remaining 30% of the patients had all received prior 5-FU therapy and progressed. All of the responding patients and 80% of the patients with stable disease received two or more cycles of this regimen after a 3- to 4-week interval off therapy. The median time to disease progression was 16.1 months for responding patients and 6.7 months for those patients with stable disease. The median survival for the responders was 20.6 months and for those with stable disease 9.8 months. The median survival for the nonresponding patients was 3.9 months. Toxicity included diarrhea in 70% of patients, skin rash (erythema) in 10%, stomatitis in 15%, nausea and vomiting in 25%, and myelosuppression in 10%. This study confirms and extends previous observations that demonstrate the improved efficacy of 5-FU when used with high-dose leucovorin in advanced colorectal carcinoma.\r"

Transaxial slices showed the retrolaryngeal extension of the enlarged thyroid and the tracheal compression by the goiter in both patients. Sagittal and coronal sections confirmed the posterior extension of the goiter. Tracheal displacement was confirmed by roentgenography of the neck in both patients. Vocal cord paralysis demonstrated by fiberoptic laryngoscope and esophageal compression shown by esophagography were found in a patient with toxic multinodular goiter with coexisting papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. In this patient, both the tracheal compression noted in SPECT imaging and the tracheomalacia suggested by the flow volume loop pattern in pulmonary function test were confirmed at the time of thyroidectomy. Our observation suggests that SPECT imaging of large multinodular goiter may be useful in preoperative delineation of the functional anatomy and the extension of goiter in relation to the airway.\r"

Studies in patients have shown that 99mTc NEP-DADT enters rapidly into the brain, but also clears rapidly (t1/2 = 17 min). In this study nine new aminoalkyl DADT derivatives were synthesized, labeled with 99mTc and tested in mice with the aim of developing an agent with increased retention in the brain. In addition, relationships between chemical properties of the derivatives and their in vivo localization were investigated. The results were as follows: (a) the R-group and its isomeric configuration has a profound influence on the biodistribution; (b) 99mTc aminoalkyl DADT derivatives with apparent pKa values of greater than 6.9 show poor brain uptake (less than 0.40% dose at 5 min); (c) lengthening of the chain between the DADT moiety and the amino-R group from ethyl to hexyl generally increases the apparent pKa and consequently lowers brain uptake; (d) a correlation (r = 0.71) exists between initial brain uptake and the octanol-buffer partition coefficient; (e) 99mTc-4'-methyl NEP-DADT has the highest partition coefficient, relatively high uptake, and longest retention in the mouse brain. This complex has characteristics suited for brain blood flow measurements.\r"

  ".W": "Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) myocardial 201TI imaging appears to offer major improvements over planar imaging. Quantitative analysis of the 201TI images appears to offer major advantages over subjective analysis in planar imaging, but the three-dimensional data available in SPECT images requires special approaches to analysis and display. Thus the myocardial \"bullseye\" display was developed to summarize and analyze the three-dimensional images of the left ventricle in two dimensions. The relative 201TI distribution to each region of the left ventricle of an individual patient can be displayed as the number of s.d.s away from normal that the region falls. We found that patient motion during the 22 min required for SPECT imaging appeared to produce artifactual defects. Thus, computer programs were developed to quantitate motion between consecutive frames of a [201TI] SPECT myocardial imaging study, simulate nonreturning vertical motion in normal patients, and correct the acquired data for motion. Motion as small as 0.5-1.0 pixel (3-6 mm) in the vertical (axial) direction caused artifactual defects in the quantitative bullseye display that resulted in a false-positive rate of up to 40% for a +1.0 pixel shift. Patient motion of magnitude greater than the threshold value for artifact-production (0.5 pixel) occurred at a rate of 10%, and should be corrected before tomographic reconstruction.\r"

Following suppression of gallbladder filling with a fatty meal, dynamic SPECT of the hepatobiliary system was carried out by acquiring two successive studies with each head of a dual-headed camera within a 35-min period following injection of technetium-99m DISIDA. Each of the four acquired studies consisted of 60 images acquired at 6 degree intervals, spanning 360 degrees. Time-shifted studies, each consisting of 60 images over 360 degrees, were generated for times 9, 17, and 26 min postinjection. Transverse, sagittal, and coronal images were generated for each study. These images were artifact-free and demonstrated physiologic shifting of the radioactivity distribution over time. When gallbladder filling was not suppressed gross artifacts were obtained. This procedure permits examination of regional liver function and provides improved visualization of the biliary tree.\r"

No differences in the mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) or splenocytes or in the effect of sera on PBL proliferation were observed. To investigate whether the amount of dietary fat affects lymphocyte proliferation, rats were fed diets containing 10 or 35 en% as fat. No difference in the mitogen-induced proliferation of splenocytes was obtained. However, serum from fed rats but not from fasted rats of the 35 en% fat group inhibited splenocyte proliferation, in comparison with serum from rats of the 10 en% fat group. Removing chylomicrons from the sera did not affect proliferation. The very low density lipoprotein + chylomicron fraction of the plasma inhibited proliferation. The inhibition was stronger for the 35 en% fat group than for the 10 en% fat group and was increased by fasting. No systematic differences in the effects on proliferation were obtained with the low or high density lipoprotein fractions of both groups. Diets containing a high amount of linoleic acid do not inhibit lymphocyte proliferation. The amount of dietary fat might affect lymphocyte proliferation through one or more factors in the plasma.\r"

When daily injections of 1 mg OH-B12 were discontinued for 3 weeks, there was no significant change in total plasma homocysteine or methionine levels and only a modest increase in methylmalonate. Orally administered OH-B12 1 mg/d in one patient was associated with an increase in plasma homocystine and a decrease in methionine within 1 month. Withdrawal of betaine 250 mg/kg/d was also associated with a rise in plasma homocystine and a fall in methionine levels. Carnitine 100 mg/kg/d lead to an increase in urinary excretion of propionylcarnitine, but did not affect plasma methylmalonate levels. No beneficial biochemical effect of folinic acid could be documented at a dose of 25 mg/d. Our results suggest that daily injections of OH-B12 are not necessary to maintain metabolic control and that orally administered OH-B12 is unlikely to be effective. Betaine appears to act synergistically with OH-B12 and should be part of the treatment regimen. Although there are theoretical reasons for using L-carnitine and folinic acid, we could not document their effectiveness in these two patients.\r"

During the 4-month study period an additional six cases of necrotizing enterocolitis and eight cases of hemorrhagic gastroenteritis occurred. Rotavirus infection was documented in 11 of these 15 symptomatic infants, in comparison with only eight rotavirus infections in 147 asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic babies (P less than 0.0001). Stools from 110 nursery personnel tested during the outbreak did not contain rotavirus. However, 12 of 59 staff members had serum IgM antibody against rotavirus, suggesting recent infection. In a case-control study we compared babies with severe gastrointestinal illness with a control group randomly selected from asymptomatic babies in the nursery during the time of the outbreak. Univariate analysis found six categorical variables and nine continuous variables that were significantly associated with disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, however, found only birth weight (P less than 0.0001), rotavirus infection (P less than 0.0001), and age at time of first nonwater feeding (P less than 0.02) to be associated with gastrointestinal illness. This study provides further evidence for the role of infection in some cases of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis and hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.\r"

  ".U": "88090580\r", 
  ".W": "The principal objective of this study was to elucidate the influence of superoxide anion on both endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation elicited by acetylcholine and endothelium-independent arterial relaxation produced by nitric oxide (NO). Pyrogallol was used to generate superoxide in the oxygenated bathing medium, and superoxide dismutase was used to scavenge superoxide. Pyrogallol caused endothelium-dependent contractions of bovine intrapulmonary arterial and venous smooth muscle after precontraction of muscle by phenylephrine. Acetylcholine- and NO-elicited arterial relaxations were promptly converted to marked contractions upon addition of pyrogallol. Moreover, pyrogallol markedly inhibited the development of arterial relaxant responses to acetylcholine and NO. However, isoproterenol- and glyceryl trinitrate-elicited arterial relaxations were unaffected by pyrogallol. Both pyrogallol and oxyhemoglobin enhanced arterial contractile responsiveness to phenylephrine in an endothelium-dependent manner, whereas indomethacin was without effect. Similarly, both pyrogallol and oxyhemoglobin inhibited acetylcholine- and NO-elicited arterial cyclic GMP accumulation, whereas indomethacin was without effect. Uncontracted arterial rings maintained under tension showed endothelium-dependent contraction and decreased cyclic GMP levels in response to oxyhemoglobin but not pyrogallol. Superoxide dismutase enhanced arterial relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation in response to both acetylcholine and NO. Using a bioassay superfusion cascade system in which intact perfused artery was the source of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) and three endothelium-denuded arterial strips mounted in series served as the detector of EDRF, superfusion of strips with pyrogallol blocked relaxation caused by perfusion of artery with acetylcholine. Superoxide dismutase enhance the relaxations produced by arterial perfusion with acetylcholine and prevented the effects of pyrogallol.\r"

Morphine-induced (10(-6) M) decreases in 45Ca++ uptake were reversed by simultaneous 5-min incubation of synaptosomes with CGRP (10(-6) M) and were enhanced by a 1-hr preincubation of the synaptosomes with CGRP (10(-6) M). CGRP produced naloxone-reversible antinociception in both the p-phenylquinone and hot-plate tests at 1 hr after i.c.v. administration, a time which corresponds to the peak CGRP-induced decrease in 45Ca++ uptake. CGRP (0.02 microgram through 40 micrograms i.c.v.) failed to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test. However, 30-min pretreatment of mice with CGRP (2 micrograms i.c.v.), a time point corresponding to a CGRP-induced increase in 45Ca++ uptake in vitro, significantly antagonized morphine-induced antinociception in the tail-flick test. A 1-hr pretreatment of mice with CGRP (2 micrograms i.c.v.), a time point in which a CGRP-induced decrease in 45Ca++ uptake was observed, slightly potentiated morphine in the tail-flick and hot-plate tests, but not in the p-phenylquinone test. The effects of CGRP on Ca++ uptake are suggestive of, but do not entirely predict, its activity in vivo and in vitro.\r"

Nephrogenous cyclic adenosine 3,5'-monophosphate levels also were measured in most of the subjects. Included in the sampling, as determined by standard diagnostic criteria, were 12 patients with absorptive hypercalciuria type I, 15 with absorptive hypercalciuria type II, 22 with renal leak hypercalciuria, 11 with normocalciuria, 6 with primary hyperparathyroidism, 3 with renal tubular acidosis and 1 with Paget's disease, as well as 12 control subjects. The observed plasma osteocalcin levels (ng. per ml. mean +/- standard error) were absorptive hypercalciuria I 2.6 +/- 0.20, absorptive hypercalciuria II 3.1 +/- 0.21, renal hypercalciuria 8.7 +/- 0.45, normocalciuric nephrolithiasis 3.3 +/- 0.25, primary hyperparathyroidism 13.2 +/- 0.91, renal tubular acidosis (range) 5.2 to 10.6, Paget's disease 18.0 and control 3.1 +/- 0.20. There were significant differences between the plasma osteocalcin levels of renal hypercalciuria versus primary hyperparathyroidism and renal hypercalciuria/primary hyperparathyroidism versus any other group. There was good correlation between plasma osteocalcin and cyclic adenosine 3,5'-monophosphate data (correlation coefficient 0.72, p less than 0.005). Plasma osteocalcin levels are a potential differential diagnostic tool for patients with stone disease. The diagnostic value compares favorably with that of cyclic adenosine 3,5'-monophosphate, with the advantage that the determination of plasma osteocalcin requires only a single test.\r"

We have thus examined the variability of the anti-tumor lytic reactivity of LAK cells obtained from patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (RCC). Tumor cell suspensions were prepared by enzymatic digestion from 37 consecutive renal cell tumors. The mean (+/- SEM) total number of cells recovered was 1.5 +/- 2.2 X 10(9) cells per tumor. The percentage of tumor cells in the suspension was 39.1 +/- 3.3% (range: 6 to 75%). Thirteen of 13 different fresh renal tumor cell preparations tested in 57 experiments and tow of two renal tumor lines tested in 10 experiments were all lysed by LAK cells. RCC patients, like normal donors, generated good LAK effectors with broad antitumor activity against autologous as well as allogenic tumors. Both renal and nonrenal tumors were equally lysed by LAK cells. LAK killing of the erythroleukemic tumor lines K562 and Daudi was significantly better than the lysis of fresh autologous and allogeneic tumor targets or cultured RCC tumor lines. Short term tumor cultures derived from renal cancer preparations proved to be sensitive and reliable tumor targets for studying the in vitro killing by LAK cells. Clinical trials testing the therapeutic role of LAK cells and IL-2 in patients with advanced renal cell cancer are currently in progress.\r"

Aortic allografts across the major histocompatibility barrier were studied in Brown-Norway and Lewis inbred rats. Grafts 1 cm long were interposed into the infra-abdominal aorta of Lewis recipients; five groups included two groups of untreated isograft and allograft control animals and three groups had allograft-CsA treatment regimens. The grafts were examined at 30, 60, and 100 days for patency, aneurysmal dilation, gross structural changes, inflammatory responses, and infiltration of W3/25- and OX8-positive lymphocytes. Only three allograft controls became occluded; the rest showed significant dilation (p less than 0.01), medial thinning and necrosis, intimal proliferation, and prominent cellular infiltration at 30 days. With all CsA regimens, aneurysmal dilation was significantly reduced or prevented (p less than 0.01), correlating with medial smooth muscle cell preservation. Cellular infiltration was delayed by an average daily dose of 5 to 10 mg/kg subcutaneous CsA for 30 days and was suppressed at 100 days by a continuous 5 mg/kg dose every 4 days. Intimal thickening in the graft was delayed but not prevented. We conclude that a low maintenance dose of CsA provides effective immunosuppression, thereby preventing aneurysm formation, and that the potential use of arterial allografts in vascular surgery may need to be readdressed.\r"

Operative mortality and long-term survival were stratified within each group according to the presence of additional risk factors: severe left ventricular dysfunction, repeat operation, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, female sex, and age over 70 years. Operative mortality was 4.0% in group A patients, 6.3% in group B, and 10.4% in group C; it increased in each group as the number of risk factors increased. Mortality was higher in patients with a left coronary artery endarterectomy compared to those with a right coronary endarterectomy only when multiple risk factors were present. Perioperative myocardial infarction occurred in 5.6% of group A patients, 6.5% of group B, and 13.1% of group C patients. Early graft patency (940 patients, 18.8%) was 801 of 901 (88.9%) for endarterectomy grafts and 2939 of 3248 (90.5%) for conventional grafts. Late patency (over 1 year) in 288 symptomatic patients was 137 of 191 (71.1%) for endarterectomy grafts and 644 of 850 (75.8%) for conventional vein grafts. Long-term (5-year) actuarial survival rate was reduced in patients requiring endarterectomy. Current anginal status is available for 3011 of 3305 patients (91.1%): 28.9% of group A patients, 32.5% of group B, and 33.7% of group C patients have recurrent angina at an average follow-up of 58.3 months. The results of this study show increased operative mortality and morbidity in patients requiring coronary artery endarterectomy and reconstruction. However, the early results and particularly the late survival, clinical status, and continued graft patency justify this approach in patients with diffuse coronary artery disease, many of whom would otherwise be inoperable.\r"

  ".W": "Five dose regimens of 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) were administered, intravenously for 2 weeks then orally for 4 or more weeks, to 20 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC). ddC was well absorbed from the gut and crossed the blood-brain barrier. 10 of the 15 patients who received 0.03-0.09 mg/kg every 4 h had increases in their absolute number of T4+ T cells at week 2 (p less than 0.05), though in many these rises were not sustained. 11 of 13 evaluable patients had a fall in their serum human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)p24 antigen by week 2 of therapy (p less than 0.01); in 4 patients the p24 antigen subsequently rose to baseline while in others the decline was sustained. Dose-related toxic effects included cutaneous eruptions, fever, mouth sores, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. A reversible painful peripheral neuropathy developed in 10 patients after 6-14 weeks' treatment. These results suggest that ddC has activity against HIV in vivo and has a different toxicity profile from that of zidovudine (AZT). 6 patients with AIDS or ARC were given an alternating regimen of oral AZT (200 mg every 4 h for 7 days) and oral ddC (0.03 mg/kg every 4 h for 7 days). The regimen was well tolerated, and the 5 patients who completed 9 or more weeks of treatment had sustained rises in their T4+ T cells and/or falls in p24 antigen.\r"

  ".W": "Tonsil core specimens of 54 children, (3 to 12 years) with clinical evidence of chronic tonsillitis and/or \"idiopathic\" tonsillar hypertrophy, were studied for the effect of the magnitude of aerobic bacterial load on tonsil size and the absolute numbers of B- and T-cell subsets. Tonsillar core specimens obtained from ten children with no history of ear, nose, or throat infections and normal appearing tonsils served as controls. The findings of this study indicate that tonsil size was directly proportional to the mean bacterial load in colony forming units/g tonsil (CFU/g) even in the absence of a clinical history of infection (p less than 0.01). A mean bacterial load of 2.4 +/- 2.1 X 10(5) CFU/g tonsil was seen in diseased tonsils as compared to 1.6 +/- 2.4 X 10(4) CFU/g tonsil in normal controls (p less than 0.01). Hemophilus influenzae (type B and non-B), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes were the most common pathogens recovered in the largest numbers from diseased tonsils; control tonsils harbored few bacteria in their cores. The absolute number of immunocompetent cells/g tonsil including T-helper, T-suppressor and B-cells (S-Ig+), were significantly greater in diseased tonsils than in controls (p less than 0.001). Increasing microbial load (CFU/g tonsil) correlated with increased numbers of T-helper (p less than 0.01) and B-cells (p less than 0.01). These data strongly support a bacterial etiology for chronic tonsillitis as well as \"idiopathic\" tonsillar hypertrophy. Bacterial induced proliferation of immunocompetent cells may be one underlying mechanism for chronic tonsillar disease in children.\r"

Twenty-one patients were treated for 10 days and 14 were treated for 28 days. Clinical evidence of serum sickness developed in 30 patients (86%) and included fever and malaise (100%), cutaneous eruptions (93%), arthralgias (67%), gastrointestinal complaints (67%), cephalgia (57%), blurring of vision (37%), arthritis, (30%) and lymphadenopathy (13%). Clinical serum sickness began on day 7 +/- 1 (X +/- S.E.M.) and lasted for 10 +/- 2 days in the 18 affected patients receiving the shorter course of ATG. In the 12 affected patients receiving the longer course of ATG, serum sickness began on day 9 +/- 1. The earliest manifestations of serum sickness were fever, malaise, and cutaneous eruptions. Cutaneous findings consisted of morbilliform eruptions (n = 19) and urticaria (n = 1) or a combination (n = 8) that lasted 10 to 14 days. Twenty-one patients (75%) developed a highly characteristic serpiginous band of erythema and purpura along the sides of the fingers, toes, palms and soles 12 to 48 hours before other symptoms of serum sickness. Biopsies of lesional skin during the course of serum sickness revealed immune deposits (IgM, IgE, IgA and C3) in dermal vasculature in 7 of 9 patients. Immunological changes that occurred during the course of serum sickness included increased serum levels of IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE. Circulating immune complexes, as measured by the C1q-binding assay, increased from a mean value of 12% to 45% on day 13 +/- 1. Complement levels (C3, C4, and CH50) decreased 50 to 80% from their baseline levels on day 10 +/- 2. Acute phase reactants increased: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and beta-2 microglobulin. Abnormal urinalysis developed in 17 patients (57%) over the course of serum sickness and included proteinuria, hematuria and hemoglobinuria on day 10 +/- 3. Hematopoietic response occurred in 43%. All 5 patients who did not develop serum sickness recovered from bone marrow failure. Our data document the clinical and immunopathological findings in human serum sickness and suggest that the principles of antigen-antibody interaction, complement activation, and resultant inflammatory response as seen in the previous animal studies are directly applicable to studies of patients with serum sickness.\r"

It is an autoimmune disease mediated by T lymphocytes of the helper T-cell (Th) subset. After sensitization to guinea-pig myelin basic protein in complete Freund's adjuvant, Lewis rats develop an autoimmune response to central nervous system (CNS) myelin basic protein, manifested clinically as paralysis and histologically by a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate of the CNS parenchyma. Suppressor cell regulation of EAE has long been suspected because Lewis rats, which spontaneously recover from active disease, are resistant to reinduction of active EAE, even though effector T-cell lines can be rescued from these recovered rats. Using cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive agent believed to inhibit Th cell function, suppressor T-cell (Ts) lines have now been generated from recovered Lewis rats. These Ts cells, when admixed with guinea pig myelin basic protein-specific Th cells, will prevent the adoptive transfer of EAE. The Ts cells appear to be CD4+, which explains previous observations that CD8+ lymphocytes are not important in the recovery of EAE in the rat. This is the first direct demonstration of Ts-cell regulation of EAE.\r"

Angiography in four patients revealed three intracranial arteriovenous malformations and one moyamoya.

Results obtained from subjects receiving patterned visual stimulation while performing an ocular fixation task were compared with results from ocular fixation alone. Visual stimulation in the macular region of either hemifield produced significant increases in metabolism of the contralateral posterior striate cortex. Visual stimulation induced highly significant asymmetries in metabolism of the prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices. Metabolic activation in extrastriate areas tended to be right-sided. These findings support the classic notion of retinotopic organization within the primary visual sensory cortex. They also indicate that the patterns of cerebral metabolism are not equivalent between the two cerebral hemispheres. This latter finding suggests that in humans the right cerebral hemisphere may be specialized for visual processing.\r"

Results show increases in extension and flexion torque and thigh circumferential measurements that are associated with both stimulation (treatment) phases in addition to a maintenance effect demonstrated during the withdrawal phase. In this patient, the technique appears to be effective in increasing muscle strength and circumferential measurements, particularly quadriceps femoris muscle torque.

  ".W": "The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a sample of patients with hemiparesis secondary to cerebrovascular accident, the relationship between the ratio of stimulus on time to off time and muscle fatigue using a commercial electrical stimulation unit. An experimental model was used to test the hypothesis that the smaller the stimulus off time relative to stimulus on time, the greater will be the muscle fatigue over time. The wrist extensor muscles of 18 patients with hemiparesis were stimulated electrically, and isometric force output was recorded continuously using an adapted strain gauge-recorder apparatus. For each testing session, peak on time of the electrical stimulus was set at 5 seconds, and off time was set at 5, 15, or 25 seconds. Six randomly assigned treatment groups participated in three separate treatment sessions in a different order at 48-hour intervals. Treatment sessions were continued either until wrist extensor muscle force output decreased to 50% of its initial value or for a maximum of 30 minutes. Data analysis revealed that significant differences in muscle tension developed among all duty cycles (p less than .01). Duty-cycle ratios of 1:1, 1:3, and 1:5 were shown to be progressively less fatiguing. Within the limits of this investigation, the 1:5 duty-cycle ratio was determined to be the best suited for initial use in programs of prolonged stimulation to the wrist extensor muscles of patients with hemiparesis. The hypothesis was accepted that the smaller the stimulus off time (rest interval) with respect to the stimulus on time, the greater will be the muscle fatigue over time.\r"

All patients with primary biliary cirrhosis had diffuse, uniform hepatic isotope retention and normal major bile ducts on planar and SPECT scans. The gallbladder was seen within 60 minutes in nine of nine patients who had intact gallbladders. The mean gallbladder volume was normal, but gallbladder ejection fractions and ejection rates were reduced in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis compared with those of healthy subjects. In contrast with previous studies of patients with sclerosing cholangitis and common bile duct obstruction, patients with primary biliary cirrhosis had different findings on scintiscans. In the early evaluation of patients with cholestasis, Tc-99m IDA hepatobiliary scintigraphy may be useful in the selection of the most appropriate invasive diagnostic test to enable a definitive diagnosis.\r"

  ".W": "In a study of the mechanism of resistance to autoimmune disease induced by T cell vaccination, rats were vaccinated against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by injecting them once in the hind footpads with a subencephalitogenic dose (10(4)) of a clone of T lymphocytes specific for myelin basic protein (BP). The response to vaccination was assayed by challenging the rats with an encephalitogenic dose (3 X 10(6)) of T lymphocytes of this BP-specific clone. Five to six days after vaccination, the cells responsible for mediating resistance to adoptively transferred EAE were concentrated in the popliteal lymph nodes draining the vaccination site. Transfer of the draining lymph node cells to unvaccinated rats led to loss of resistance in the donor rats and acquisition of resistance by the recipient rats. Limiting-dilution cultures of the draining lymph node cells were established with irradiated cells of the BP-specific clone as stimulators. Two sets of T lymphocytes specifically responsive to the BP-specific T cells from the clone were isolated: CD4+CD8- helper and CD4-CD8+ suppressor cells. The helper T cells, like the BP antigen, specifically stimulated the BP-specific vaccinating clone. In contrast, the suppressor T cells specifically suppressed the response of the BP-specific vaccinating clone to its BP antigen. These results suggest that T cell vaccination induces resistance to autoimmune disease by activating an antiidiotypic network.\r"

A novel hormone-antibody conjugate, consisting of an analog of melanocyte-stimulating hormone chemically coupled to a monoclonal antibody to CD3, the invariant component of the T cell receptor complex, was used to target human melanoma cells for destruction by human cytotoxic T lymphocytes that bear no specificity for the tumor cells. As targeting components of such anti-CD3 conjugates, hormones or growth factors are expected to prove more effective than antibodies to tumor-associated antigens in focusing the destructive activity of cytotoxic T cells on tumor target cells.\r"

The emergency group included ten patients, one of whom had the same procedure as those in the elective group and nine patients who had only esophageal transection with the EEA stapler. The use of the stapler in performing splenectomy and the devascularization operation did not decrease the recurrence of bleeding. Esophageal stapling in the emergency group controlled the bleeding in 90 per cent of the patients. The reappearance of esophageal varices and gastric varices in three patients in the emergency group was managed by distal splenorenal shunt operation.\r"

  ".W": "The effects of cerebellar retraction on brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEPs) were studied in 15 New Zealand rabbits. In the first series, a Fogarty catheter was placed in the cerebellopontine angle of 5 rabbits. When a balloon volume of 0.2 mL was produced, only the latencies of waves III-V of the ipsilateral side increased. With a volume of 0.4 mL the ipsilateral BAEPs were irreversibly lost and the contralateral one reversibly changed. A volume of 0.6 mL caused loss of the BAEP on both sides and death of the animal. In another series, the cerebellum of 10 rabbits was retracted by a self-retaining retractor laterally to medially, so an approach to the cerebellopontine angle was simulated. With a retraction of up to 36 power units (p) the ipsilateral BAEPs were reversibly changed. A retraction of 54 p caused irreversible loss of wave V on both sides. With 84 p ipsilateral and contralateral waves III-V were immediately lost. The animals died within 7 minutes. Our experimental investigation shows that not only a defined volume in the cerebellopontine angle can cause irreversible impairment of brainstem function, but also uncontrolled retraction of the cerebellum.\r"

We also assessed the frequency of additional findings including pleural effusion (38%), pericardial thickening (38%), displacement or narrowing of either the tracheobronchial tree (68%) or major vessels (68%), and hepatic masses (24%). Mediastinal involvement was present in 92% of cases, as compared with 13% reported in a large series based on conventional radiography. These data show the spectrum of intrathoracic CT findings in proved, untreated cases of small-cell bronchogenic carcinoma.\r"

  ".W": "High-resolution CT (HRCT) has the ability to demonstrate both asbestos-related pleural disease and parenchymal abnormalities consistent with asbestosis. The role of CT in the diagnosis of asbestosis can be defined by comparing it with radiography. We evaluated 60 men who had a history of occupational exposure to asbestos and whose outside chest radiographs were considered abnormal. Chest radiographs (inside films) and HRCT were performed in all patients at our institution and were interpreted independently by experienced radiologists. Outside film results were compiled from the submitted reports. The final conclusion regarding the interpretation of the radiologic examinations was determined by consensus when disagreements existed. Positive predictive values (the likelihood that a positive report is correct) for pleural disease were: outside films 56%, inside films 79%, HRCT 100%. The positive predictive values for parenchymal disease were: outside films 51%, inside films 83%, HRCT 100%. The addition of HRCT to chest radiography is most useful in eliminating false-positive diagnoses of asbestos-related pleural disease caused by subpleural fat and false-positive diagnoses of parenchymal asbestosis in patients with extensive plaques or emphysema obscuring lung detail. The interpretation of chest radiographs in patients exposed to asbestos is often extremely difficult and subjective, and we recommend that positive findings (except calcified plaques) be confirmed with HRCT.\r"
